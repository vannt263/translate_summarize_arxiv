    "it is well known that two important experimental results were in the news in 2012 :    * on 8 march 2012 , the daya bay collaboration announced a @xmath1 discovery of @xmath2 for this smallest neutrino mixing angle @xcite , @xmath3 which is equivalent to @xmath4 .",
    "the convincing daya bay result puts the preliminary results of t2k @xcite , minos @xcite and double chooz @xcite , which all hinted at @xmath2 in 2011 , on solid ground .",
    "in particular , the fact that @xmath0 is not strongly suppressed is a good news to the experimental attempts towards a measurement of cp violation in the lepton sector . *",
    "on 4 july 2012 , the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) independently announced the discovery of a higgs - like boson at the mass scale of 125 gev to 127 gev .",
    "if this result turns out to be true , it will have an important impact on the development of neutrino physics because most of the neutrino mass models depend on the existence of the higgs particle(s ) and yukawa interactions .",
    "therefore , a brief overview of where we are standing and where we are expecting to go makes sense .",
    "the remaining parts of this review paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a fast overview of some fundamental neutrino properties , such as the speed of neutrinos , the nature of massive neutrinos and the number of neutrino species .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a brief description of the flavor issues of charged leptons and neutrinos , including the mass spectrum , flavor mixing pattern and cp violation .",
    "we compare the observed pattern of quark flavor mixing with that of lepton flavor mixing . in section 4",
    "we go into details of possible lepton flavor structures by outlining two phenomenological strategies and taking a number of typical examples .",
    "the impact of large @xmath0 on the running behaviors of other flavor mixing parameters is discussed in section 5 by using the one - loop renormalization - group equations ( rges ) in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the seesaw - enhanced electromagnetic dipole moments of three majorana neutrinos based on a tev seesaw scenario . a summary and some concluding remarks",
    "are given in section 7 .",
    "the constancy of the speed of light @xmath5 in vacuum and the independence of physical laws from the choice of inertial systems are two fundamental propositions of the special relativity ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "if our world is lorentz invariant , a free particle s energy @xmath6 , momentum @xmath7 and rest mass @xmath8 satisfy the relationship @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity of this particle turns out to be @xmath10 , implying that it can not travel faster than light in vacuum .",
    "could a particle be superluminal ?",
    "the answer would be yes if the particle had an imaginary mass ( called a `` tachyon '' @xcite ) or if the lorentz invariance were broken .",
    "the opera collaboration claimed a  convincing \" measurement of the superluminal neutrinos in september 2011 @xcite .",
    "but five months later this story ended up with a mistake of the bad connection of the optical fiber .",
    "the opera paper was updated in july 2012 by including the new sources of errors , and the new result was in agreement with the sr . here",
    "let us quote steven weinberg s comments on the original result of the opera experiment : `` the report of this experiment is pretty impressive , but it bothers me that there is plenty of evidence that all sorts of other particles never travel faster than light , while observations of neutrinos are exceptionally difficult .",
    "it is as if someone said that there are fairies in the bottom of their garden , but they can only be seen on dark , foggy nights . ''",
    "an early measurement of the neutrino speed was done by using the pulsed pion beams ( produced by the pulsed proton beams hitting a target ) at the fermilab in the 1970s @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the speed of muons was compared with that of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the same measurement was repeated in 2007 by using the minos detector @xcite . in 2011",
    "the speed of neutrinos was also measured in a few other long - baseline neutrino experiments , such as the icarus @xcite , borexino @xcite and lvd @xcite experiments .",
    "but the most stringent constraint on the speed of neutrinos was from the observational data of the supernova 1987a @xcite : @xmath11 obtained by comparing the arrival time of light with that of neutrinos .",
    "the neutrinos are massless in the standard model ( sm ) as a result of its simple structure and renormalizability . on the one hand",
    ", the sm does not contain any right - handed neutrinos , and thus there is no way to write out the dirac neutrino mass term . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm conserves the @xmath12 gauge symmetry and only contains the higgs doublet , and thus the majorana mass term is forbidden .",
    "although the sm accidently possesses the @xmath13 symmetry and naturally allows neutrinos to be massless , the vanishing of neutrino masses in the sm is not guaranteed by any fundamental symmetry or conservation law .",
    "today we have achieved a lot of robust evidence for neutrino oscillations from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations implies that at least two of the three neutrinos must be massive and the lepton flavors must be mixed .",
    "this is the first convincing evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "1 is a schematic plot of the mass spectrum of the sm leptons and quarks at the electroweak scale .",
    "one can see that the span between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is at least twelve orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , there exists an obvious `` desert '' spanning six orders of magnitude between the neutrino masses and the masses of the charged fermions .",
    "why do the sm fermions have such hierarchy and desert puzzles ?",
    "the answer to this important question remains open .",
    "in particular , the tiny neutrino masses must have a peculiar origin ( e.g. , via the seesaw mechanisms @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there might exist one or more kev sterile neutrinos in the desert as a natural candidate for warm dark matter @xcite .",
    "a _ pure _ dirac mass term added into the sm is in general disfavored , unless the theory is built by introducing extra dimensions .",
    "such a mass term in a renormalizable model of electroweak interactions would worsen the fermion mass hierarchy problem . an effective majorana mass term given by the right - handed neutrinos and their charge - conjugated counterparts",
    "is not forbidden by the sm gauge symmetry , unless the contrived assumption of lepton number conservation is imposed on the theory .",
    "hence most theorists believe that massive neutrinos are more likely to be the majorana particles and their salient feature is lepton number violation .    the unique window to verify the majorana nature of massive neutrinos is to observe the neutrinoless doube - beta ( @xmath16 ) decay .",
    "so far we have not obtained very convincing evidence for this lepton - number - violating process .",
    "even if the @xmath16 decay were never observed , one would still be unable to conclude that massive neutrinos are the dirac particles @xcite .",
    "the effective mass of the @xmath16 decay could vanish if the majorana cp - violating phases lie in some specific regions . on the other hand , there are some other mechanisms which can lead to the @xmath16 decay",
    ". such new physics effects could be of the same order as or even larger than the standard light - neutrino - exchange effect @xcite .    given the sm interactions , a massive dirac neutrino can have a tiny ( one - loop ) magnetic dipole moment @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bohr magneton @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a massive majorana neutrino can not have magnetic and electric dipole moments , because its antiparticle is just itself . both dirac and majorana neutrinos can have _ transition _ dipole moments ( of a size comparable with @xmath19 ) @xcite , which may give rise to neutrino decays , scattering effects with electrons , interactions with external magnetic fields ( red - giant stars , the sun , supernovae , and so on ) , and contributions to neutrino masses .",
    "current experimental bounds on the neutrino dipole moments are at the level of @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that ",
    "three \" is a mystically popular number in particle physics , such as three @xmath21 quarks , three @xmath22 quarks , three @xmath23 leptons , three @xmath24 neutrinos , three colors and three forces in the sm . in this case , why do people want to go beyond @xmath25 ?    the study of light sterile neutrinos has become a popular direction in neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "one is motivated to consider such",
    " exotic \" particles for several reasons . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite provides a very elegant interpretation of the small masses of @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) with the help of two or three heavy sterile neutrinos , and the latter can even help account for the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe via the leptogenesis mechanism @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the lsnd @xcite , miniboone @xcite and reactor @xcite antineutrino anomalies can all be explained as the active - sterile antineutrino oscillations in the assumption of one or two species of sterile antineutrinos whose masses are below 1 ev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a careful analysis of the existing data on the big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite or the cosmic microwave background anisotropy , galaxy clustering and supernovae ia @xcite seems to favor at least one species of sterile neutrinos at the sub - ev mass scale . on the other hand ,",
    "sufficiently long - lived sterile neutrinos in the kev mass range might serve for a good candidate for warm dark matter if they were present in the early universe @xcite .",
    "if the three known neutrinos have mixing with a few new degrees of freedom above or far above the fermi scale , an exciting window will be open to new physics at high energy scales . in this case",
    ", however , the mixing between light and heavy neutrinos violates the unitarity of the @xmath28 light neutrino mixing matrix and might result in some observable effects in the future precision neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "there are three central concepts in flavor physics : mass , flavor mixing and cp violation @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing at low energies is effectively described by a @xmath28 matrix @xmath29 , the so - called maki - nakagawa - sakata - pontecorvo ( mnsp ) matrix @xcite . given the unitarity of @xmath29 , it can be parametrized in terms of three angles and three phases @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 is physically relevant if massive neutrinos are the majorana particles .",
    "fogli _ et al _ @xcite have recently done a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data and obtained the ranges of two neutrino mass - squared differences ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and three neutrino mixing angles , as listed in table 1 , where nh and ih stand for the normal hierarchy ( @xmath37 ) and the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "the two mass - squared differences of three neutrinos have been determined , to a very good degree of accuracy , from current experimental data : @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale remains unknown and may hopefully be determined in the following experimental or observational ways : the single @xmath41 decay , the @xmath16 decay and the cosmological constraints .",
    "2 shows the parameter space of @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( the effective electron neutrino mass in the @xmath41 decay ) and @xmath44 ( the effective mass of the @xmath16 decay ) . a precision measurement of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the sub - ev range could determine the neutrino mass hierarchy . in the two lower panels of fig",
    "2 there remains a large vertical spread in the allowed slanted bands , as a result of the unknown majorana cp - violating phases in the @xmath47 components .",
    "this observation indicates that more precise data in either the @xmath48 plane or the @xmath49 plane might provide some useful constraints on the majorana phases .",
    "before the absolute mass scale is determined , there remain two open questions : ( 1 ) is @xmath50 bigger or smaller than @xmath51 ? ( 2 ) can one neutrino mass ( @xmath51 or @xmath50 ) be vanishing or vanishingly small ?",
    "the first question awaits an experimental answer in the foreseeable future , such as a long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with appreciable terrestrial matter effects @xcite or a long - baseline reactor antineutrino oscillation experiment with accurate information on the energy spectrum @xcite . a theoretical answer to",
    "the second question is strongly model - dependent .",
    "examples of this type include the minimal type - i seesaw mechanism with two heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite or the friedberg - lee ansatz with an effective dirac or majorana neutrino mass operator @xcite .",
    "the fact that the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 is not strongly suppressed leads us to some new questions about the feature of lepton flavor mixing : ( 1 ) can the relatively large @xmath0 be understood by an underlying flavor symmetry or is it generated by a symmetry breaking mechanism or quantum corrections ? ( 2 ) does @xmath52 still hold ? ( 3 ) what is the strength of leptonic cp violation ?    the structure of the mnsp lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath29 is significantly different from that of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark flavor mixing matrix @xmath53 .",
    "the ckm matrix is nearly the unit matrix up to some small corrections , while the mnsp matrix has an approximate @xmath54-@xmath55 symmetry .",
    "the full @xmath54-@xmath55 symmetry of @xmath29 in modulus is described by the equalities @xmath56 equivalent to two independent sets of conditions in the standard parametrization given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) @xcite : @xmath57 or @xmath58 if @xmath59 is exactly equal to @xmath60 , then one may arrive at a partial @xmath54-@xmath55 permutation symmetry in the mnsp matrix @xmath29 ( i.e. , the equality @xmath61 ) .",
    "now that @xmath62 has firmly been established by the daya bay experiment @xcite , it becomes crucial to check the deviation of @xmath59 from @xmath60 and ( or ) a possible departure of @xmath63 from @xmath64 .",
    "we speculate that @xmath29 might have an approximate @xmath54-@xmath55 symmetry with @xmath65 , in contrast with the approximate off - diagonal symmetry of the ckm matrix @xmath53 in modulus ( i.e. , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , the majorana neutrino mass matrix of the form @xmath68 predicts the @xmath54-@xmath55 permutation symmetry of the mnsp matrix @xmath29 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; while the mass matrix of the form @xmath71 leads us to the @xmath54-@xmath55 symmetry of @xmath29 with @xmath72 and @xmath70 . in either of the above textures of @xmath73 , its entries have certain kinds of linear correlations or equalities and",
    "thus can be generated from some underlying flavor symmetries . in view of the experimental evidence for @xmath62 @xcite , the pattern of @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) has to be modified . for a similar reason , the more reliable and accurate experimental knowledge on @xmath59 and @xmath63 will be useful for us to identify the effect of @xmath54-@xmath55 symmetry breaking and build more realistic models for lepton mass generation , flavor mixing and cp violation .      if neutrinos are the majorana particles , the @xmath28 mnsp matrix @xmath29 contains three cp - violating phases @xmath63 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "among them , @xmath63 determines the strength of cp and t violation in neutrino oscillations , because both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are proportional to the leptonic jarlskog invariant @xmath78 in vacuum @xcite . the phases @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which have nothing to do with neutrino oscillations , are associated with the @xmath16 decay . note that @xmath63 itself is also of the majorana nature , although it is usually referred to as the dirac phase : one reason is that @xmath63 may appear in other lepton - number - violating processes , even if it can sometimes be arranged _ not _ to appear in the @xmath16 decay ; and the other reason is that @xmath63 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are actually entangled with one another in the rge running from one energy scale to another .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is not strongly suppressed is certainly a good news to the experimental attempts towards a final measurement of cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the reason is simply that the strength of leptonic cp violation ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) is proportional to @xmath80 . in the quark sector",
    "one has determined the corresponding jarlskog invariant @xmath81 @xcite and attributed its smallness to the strongly suppressed values of quark flavor mixing angles ( i.e. , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) . in the lepton sector",
    "both @xmath85 and @xmath59 are large , and thus it is possible to achieve a relatively large value of @xmath86 if the cp - violating phase @xmath63 is not small either .",
    "taking @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a realistic example of @xmath29 , we arrive at @xmath90 , implying that the magnitude of leptonic cp violation can actually reach the percent level in neutrino oscillations if @xmath63 is not strongly suppressed . whether cp violation is significant or not turns out to be an important question in lepton physics , especially in neutrino phenomenology .",
    "the relative sizes of the nine elements of the mnsp matrix @xmath29 can not be completely fixed unless we have known @xmath91 or @xmath92 as well as the range of @xmath63 . with the help of the available experimental data and the unitarity of @xmath29",
    ", we find @xmath93 where ",
    "@xmath94 \" implies that the relative magnitudes of @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( for @xmath27 ) remain undetermined at present . in comparison ,",
    "the nine elements of the ckm matrix @xmath53 are known to have the following hierarchy @xcite : @xmath97 there is a striking similarity between the quark and lepton flavor mixing matrices : the smallest elements of both @xmath53 and @xmath29 appear in their respective top - right corners .    in the history of flavor physics it took quite a long time to measure the four independent parameters of @xmath53 , but the experimental development had a clear roadmap : @xmath98 namely , the observation of the largest mixing angle @xmath99 was the first step , the determination of the smallest mixing angle @xmath100 was an important turning point , and then the quark flavor physics entered an era of precision measurements in which cp violation could be explored and new physics could be searched for .",
    "interestingly and hopefully , the lepton flavor physics is repeating the same story : @xmath101 where @xmath59 is the largest and @xmath0 is the smallest .",
    "the observation of @xmath0 in the daya bay experiment is paving the way for future experiments to study leptonic cp violation and to look for possible new physics ( e.g. , whether the @xmath28 mnsp matrix @xmath29 is exactly unitary or not @xcite ) , in particular through the measurements of neutrino oscillations for different sources of neutrino beams . the majorana nature of three massive neutrinos and their other two cp - violating phases ( i.e. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 )",
    "can also be probed in the new era of neutrino physics .",
    "the mnsp matrix @xmath29 actually describes a fundamental mismatch between the flavor and mass eigenstates of six leptons , or a mismatch between diagonalizations of the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath102 and the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath73 in a given model , no matter whether the origin of neutrino masses is attributed to the seesaw mechanisms or not @xcite . assuming massive neutrinos to be the majorana particles , we may simply write out the leptonic mass terms as @xmath103 where  @xmath104 \" stands for the flavor eigenstates of charged leptons ,  @xmath5 \" denotes the charge - conjugated neutrino fields , and @xmath73 is symmetric . by using the unitary matrices",
    "@xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , one can diagonalize @xmath102 and @xmath73 through the transformations @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "then one arrives at the lepton mass terms in terms of the mass eigenstates : @xmath110 extending this basis transformation to the standard charged - current interactions , we immediately obtain @xmath111 in which @xmath112 .",
    "the above treatment is most general at a given energy scale ( e.g. , the electroweak scale ) .",
    "there are two different strategies of phenomenologically understanding the structure of the mnsp matrix @xcite .",
    "\\(1 ) _ the mixing angles of @xmath29 are associated with the lepton mass ratios_. the structure of lepton flavor mixing is directly determined by the structures of @xmath105 and @xmath107 . since these two unitary matrices are used to diagonalize @xmath102 and @xmath73 , respectively , their structures are governed by those of @xmath102 and @xmath73 , whose eigenvalues are the physical lepton masses .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that the dimensionless flavor mixing angles of @xmath29 should be certain kinds of functions whose variables include four independent mass ratios of three charged leptons and three neutrinos .",
    "namely , @xmath113 where the greek subscripts denote the charged leptons , the latin subscripts stand for the neutrinos , and",
    " @xmath114 \" implies other dimensionless parameters originating from the lepton mass matrices .",
    "such an expectation has proved valid in the quark sector to explain why the relation @xmath115 works quite well and how the hierarchical structure of the ckm matrix @xmath53 is related to the strong hierarchies of quark masses ( i.e. , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) @xcite .",
    "as for the phenomenon of lepton flavor mixing , it is apparently difficult to link two large mixing angles @xmath85 and @xmath59 to @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xcite . hence one may consider to ascribe the largeness of @xmath85 and @xmath59 to a weak hierarchy of three neutrino masses , such as the conjecture @xmath120 @xcite .    to establish a direct relation between @xmath121 and lepton mass ratios",
    ", one has to specify the textures of @xmath102 and @xmath73 by allowing some of their elements to vanish or to be vanishingly small .",
    "a typical example of this kind is the fritzsch ansatz @xcite , @xmath122 which is able to account for the present neutrino oscillation data to an acceptable degree of accuracy ( e.g. , @xmath123 ) @xcite .",
    "another well - known and viable example is the two - zero textures of @xmath73 in the basis where @xmath102 is diagonal @xcite .",
    "note that the texture zeros of a fermion mass matrix dynamically mean that the corresponding matrix elements are sufficiently suppressed as compared with their neighboring counterparts , and they can be derived from a certain flavor symmetry in a given theoretical framework ( e.g. , with the help of the froggatt - nielson mechanism @xcite or discrete flavor symmetries @xcite ) .",
    "\\(2 ) _ the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath29 consists of a constant leading term @xmath124 and a small perturbation term @xmath125_. in fact , @xmath29 has been conjectured to have the following structure for a quite long time @xcite : @xmath126 in which the leading term @xmath124 is a constant matrix responsible for two larger mixing angles @xmath85 and @xmath59 , and the next - to - leading term @xmath125 is a perturbation responsible for both the smallest mixing angle @xmath0 and the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath63 .",
    "so far a lot of flavor symmetries have been brought into exercise to derive @xmath124 , while @xmath125 might originate from either an explicit flavor symmetry breaking scenario or some finite quantum corrections at a given energy scale or from a superhigh - energy scale to the electroweak scale .",
    "in this case the mnsp matrix @xmath29 is approximately a constant matrix whose mixing angles are independent of the lepton mass ratios .",
    "this conjecture is actually in conflict with the conjecture made in the first strategy .",
    "the reason for this  conflict \" is rather simple : the assumed structures of lepton flavor mixing in eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 17 ) correspond to two different structures of lepton mass matrices .",
    "as we have pointed out above , the direct dependence of @xmath121 on @xmath127 and @xmath128 is usually a direct consequence of the texture zeros of @xmath102 and ( or ) @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast , a constant flavor mixing pattern @xmath124 may arise from some special textures of @xmath102 and ( or ) @xmath73 whose entries have certain kinds of linear correlations or equalities .",
    "for instance , the texture @xcite @xmath129 assures @xmath107 to be of the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern to be discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix has no zero entries , but its nine elements satisfy the sum rules @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( for @xmath132 ) .",
    "such correlative relations are similar to those texture zeros in the sense that both of them may reduce the number of free parameters associated with lepton mass matrices , making some predictions for the lepton flavor mixing angles technically possible .    in short",
    ", one may try to understand the structure of the mnsp matrix @xmath29 by following two phenomenological strategies :    1 .   to explore possible relations between the flavor mixing angles and the lepton mass ratios ; 2 .   to investigate possible constant patterns of lepton flavor mixing as the leading - order effects .",
    "the first possibility points to some vanishing ( or vanishingly small ) entries of @xmath102 and @xmath73 , while the second possibility indicates some equalities or linear correlations among the entries of @xmath102 or @xmath73 . in both cases",
    "the underlying flavor symmetries play a crucial role in deriving the structures of lepton mass matrices which finally determine the structure of lepton flavor mixing . of course",
    ", how to pin down the correct flavor symmetries remains an open question .",
    "it is well known that the special textures of @xmath102 and @xmath73 like that in eq . ( 18 ) can easily be derived from certain discrete flavor symmetries ( e.g. , @xmath133 or @xmath134 ) @xcite .",
    "that is why eq .",
    "( 17 ) formally summarizes a large class of lepton flavor mixing patterns in which the leading terms are constant matrices originating from some underlying flavor symmetries .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is not very small poses a meaningful question to us today : can this mixing angle naturally be generated from the perturbation matrix @xmath125 ?",
    "the answer to this question is certainly dependent upon the form of @xmath124 in the flavor symmetry limit . here",
    "we reexamine five typical patterns of @xmath124 in order to get a feeling of the respective structures of @xmath125 which can be constrained by current experimental data on neutrino oscillations .    for the sake of simplicity , we typically take @xmath87 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 as our inputs to fix the primary structure of the mnsp matrix @xmath29",
    ". then we have @xmath137 it makes sense to compare a constant mixing pattern @xmath124 with the observed pattern of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( 19 ) , such that one may estimate the structure of the corresponding perturbation matrix @xmath125 .",
    "let us consider five well - known patterns of @xmath124 in the following for illustration .",
    "\\(1 ) the democratic mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath138 whose three mixing angles are @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the standard parametrization as given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . with the help of eq . ( 19 ) , we immediately obtain the form of @xmath142 as follows : @xmath143 one can see that the magnitude of each matrix element of @xmath125 is of @xmath144 , implying that the realistic pattern of @xmath29 might result from a democratic perturbation to @xmath124 ( i.e. , the nine entries of @xmath125 are all proportional to a common small parameter ) .",
    "\\(2 ) the bimaximal mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath145 which has @xmath139 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the standard parametrization . comparing eq .",
    "( 22 ) with eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we obtain the perturbation matrix @xmath148 we see that the matrix elements @xmath149 and @xmath150 are highly suppressed . in other words , the initially maximal angle @xmath151 receives the minimal correction , which is much smaller than the one received by the initially minimal angle @xmath152 . such a situation is more or less unnatural , at least from a point of view of model building .",
    "\\(3 ) the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern of lepton flavors",
    "@xcite : @xmath153 whose three mixing angles are @xmath154 , @xmath146 and @xmath155 in the standard parametrization . in a similar way we get the corresponding perturbation matrix @xmath156 it is quite obvious that @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath149 and @xmath159 are highly suppressed .",
    "so two initially large angles @xmath160 and @xmath151 are only slightly modified by the perturbation effects , but the initially minimal angle @xmath152 receives the maximal correction .",

    "the perturbation matrix @xmath125 turns out to be @xmath164 similar to the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern , two initially large angles of the golden - ratio mixing pattern are only slightly corrected , but the initially minimal angle @xmath152 is significantly modified by the same perturbation .",
    "\\(5 ) the hexagonal mixing pattern of lepton flavors @xcite : @xmath165 whose mixing angles are @xmath166 , @xmath140 and @xmath155 in the standard parametrization . in this case",
    "we obtain the perturbation matrix @xmath167 this result is quite analogous to the one obtained in eq .",
    "( 25 ) or eq .",

    ".    the effective electromagnetic dipole moments of three neutrinos and the rates of their radiative decays can be maximally enhanced by a factor of @xmath388 and a factor of @xmath406 , respectively , no matter whether the seesaw scale is around or below the tev energy scale .",
    "this observation is new and nontrivial , and it reveals an intrinsic and presumably important correlation between the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos and the origin of their masses .",
    "such a correlation may even serve as a sensitive touch - stone for the highly - regarded seesaw mechanism .",
    "after the daya bay measurement of the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 , it is natural to ask where we are standing and where we are expecting to go in neutrino physics .",
    "we have tried to answer these two questions from a phenomenological point of view in this review paper , although our answers are incomplete and full of conjectures . to be specific ,",
    "we have given a fast overview of some fundamental neutrino properties and paid particular interest to the flavor issues of charged leptons and neutrinos , including the mass spectrum , flavor mixing pattern and cp violation .",
    "we have gone into details of possible lepton flavor structures by describing two useful phenomenological strategies and giving a number of typical examples . the impact of large @xmath0 on the running behaviors of other flavor mixing parameters has been discussed in the framework of the mssm .",
    "we have also illustrated the seesaw - enhanced electromagnetic dipole moments of three majorana neutrinos based on a viable tev seesaw scenario .    ,",

    "the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath423 in 2012 is a milestone in particle physics .",
    "but the effective strong cp - violating phase @xmath426 in the quark sector and the three weak cp - violating phases ( i.e. , @xmath422 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) in the lepton sector remain unknown .",
    "moreover , the absolute mass scale of three neutrinos and their mass ordering have not been determined .",
    "we hope that various precision neutrino experiments can help pin down the relevant parameters in the lepton sector and then shed light on the flavor dynamics in the foreseeable future .",
    "of course , the picture in fig .",
    "8 may be too simple and too naive because we are not sure whether some of those  fundamental \" parameters are really fundamental or not .",
    "new degrees of freedom , such as the sterile neutrinos or the supersymmetric particles , might be discovered and make the flavor sector much messier . if the underlying flavor theory is regarded as an animal , one has no idea whether it is a donkey or an elephant or something else . in this sense",
    "we are blind today and have to make a lot of experimental and theoretical efforts to identify its nose , eyes , ears , legs and so on in order to make sure what animal it is .",
    "the road behind has repeatedly told us that the road ahead is always challenging , but it is always exciting .",
