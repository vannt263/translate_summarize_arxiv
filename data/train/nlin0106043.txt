    "during the past two decades asymptotic analysis of stochastic transport equations [ navier - stokes equation , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations , advection - diffusion equation and the like ] has attracted increasing attention .",
    "various forms of the renormalization group ( rg ) have proved to be particularly useful in this investigation , and a great deal of work has been carried out in the rg analysis of the stochastic navier - stokes equation and the problem of a passive scalar ( turbulent diffusion or heat conduction )  @xcite .",
    "somewhat less effort has been devoted to the asymtotic analysis of stochastic magnetohydrodynamics since the pioneering work of fournier et al  @xcite and adzhemyan et al  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in these papers the existence of two different anomalous scaling regimes ( kinetic and magnetic ) in three dimensions was established corresponding to two non - trivial infrared - stable fixed points of the renormalization group .",
    "it was also conjectured that in two dimensions the magnetic scaling regime does not exist due to instability of the magnetic fixed point .",
    "however , in both papers there were flaws in the renormalization of the model in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "even more serious shortcomings are present in recent investigations of mhd turbulence  @xcite , in which a specifically two - dimensional setup has been applied with the use of the stream function and magnetic potential .",
    "therefore , results obtained for the two - dimensional case in these papers can not be considered completely conclusive .    in the present paper",
    "we have first carried out a field - theoretic rg analysis of the stochastically forced equations of magnetohydrodynamics with the proper account of additional divergences which arise in two dimensions .",
    "this gives rise to a two - parameter expansion of scaling exponents and scaling functions  @xcite , the parameters of which are the deviation of the spatial dimension from two and the deviation of the exponent of the powerlike correlation function of random forcing from its critical value . in this double expansion",
    "the standard procedure of minimal subtractions was used in the renormalization of the corresponding field - theoretic model .",
    "we have carried out a one - loop rg analysis of the large - scale asymptotic behavior of the model and confirmed the basic conclusions of the previous analyses  @xcite that near two dimensions a scaling regime driven by the velocity fluctuations may exist , but no magnetically driven scaling regime can occur . we have also identified a scaling regime driven by thermal fluctuations  @xcite of the velocity field .",
    "second , we have performed a renormalization of the model with a different choice of finite renormalization in order to find at which non - integer dimension the magnetic fixed point ceases to be stable .",
    "this borderline dimension was found in ref .",
    "@xcite with the use of the momentum - shell rg in a setup valid in a fixed space dimension @xmath2 . in the two - parameter expansion with the deviation of the exponent of the powerlike correlation function of random forcing from its critical value @xmath1 and @xmath3 as expansion parameters this effect can not be traced .",
    "therefore , we have carried out a rg analysis according to the `` principle of maximum divergences '' in the sense that we have included in the renormalization all graphs relevant in two dimensions , and fixed the finite renormalization in a way which reproduces the results of a momentum - shell renormalization of wilson  @xcite at one - loop order .",
    "this procedure gives rise to rg functions such that in the limit of small @xmath4 , @xmath1 they reproduce the results of the two - parameter expansion , and in the limit of small @xmath1 ( but finite @xmath4 ) they yield the results of the usual @xmath1 expansion  @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the long - range asymptotic behavior of the model in the framework of the latter scheme without any small parameter and found , in particular , that in this case thermal fluctuations make the value of the borderline dimension of the magnetic scaling regime significantly lower ( @xmath5 ) than in the @xmath1 expansion  @xcite ) ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii starts from the functional formulation of the solution of stochastic mhd .",
    "this is convenient for the analysis based on the standard field - theoretic rg approach , the details of which are described in sec .",
    "the kolmogorov constant for mhd is calculated in sec .",
    "iv at the leading order of the two - parameter expansion . in sec . v a rg analysis of the model with maximum divergences is carried out in arbitrary dimension , and the observed strong effect of thermal fluctuations is discussed . in sec . vi the conclusions are presented .",

    "the statistics of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are completely determined by the non - linear equations ( [ nsr ] ) , ( [ magnet ] ) , ( [ nsr1 ] ) , and the probability distribution of the external large - scale random forces @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is customary  @xcite to consider random forces @xmath20 and @xmath21 having a zero - mean gaussian distribution with correlation functions of the form @xmath22 in which the time correlations of the fields have the character of white noise , while the spatial correlations are controlled by the scalar function @xmath23 .",
    "transversality of the matrix ( [ cor0 ] ) is a consequence of the equations @xmath24 .    to analyze renormalization near two dimensions we consider the model ( [ nsr ] ) , ( [ magnet ] ) , ( [ nsr1 ] ) supplemented by the forcing statistics @xmath25 where @xmath26\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the dimensional constants @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in  ( [ corel ] ) control the amount of randomly injected energy . the choice of the values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 determines the powerlike falloff of the long - range forcing correlations and the space dimension of the system under consideration .",
    "we choose uncorrelated kinematic and magnetic driving [ @xmath31 , because we are considering arbitrary space dimension @xmath0 and it is not possible to define a nonvanishing correlation function of a vector field and a pseudovector field in this case .",
    "this can be done separately for integer dimensions of space , but , contrary to claims of some authors  @xcite , is no obstacle for application of the rg  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the matrix @xmath32 in ( [ silan ] ) reflects a more detailed intrinsic statistical definition of forcing , whose consequences are deeply discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . technically , it is necessary to accompany the long - range correlations [ corresponding to the term @xmath33 in ( [ silan ] ) ] by local correlations [ described by the analytic in @xmath34 term in the correlation function ( [ silan ] ) ] in order to construct a consistent renormalization procedure for the corresponding field - theoretic model  @xcite .",
    "this feature has been overlooked in the previous analyses of the problem  @xcite .",
    "the prefactors @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ( [ corel ] ) have been extracted for the convenience of calculations .",
    "the definition ( [ silan ] ) includes two principal  low- and high - wave - number scale  kinetic forcings separated by transition region in the vicinity of the characteristic wave number of order @xmath37^{1/(2\\delta+2a\\epsilon)}).$ ]",
    "the forcing contribution with local correlations gives a phenomenological description of small - scale thermal fluctuations of the magnetic induction and the velocity field  @xcite .",
    "the long - range parts of the translational invariant correlation functions ( [ silan ] ) become scale invariant at the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 . for the exponent @xmath1 the value",
    "@xmath38 is physically most reasonable , since it represents the assumption that random forces in the navier - stokes equation  ( [ nsr ] ) act at very large scales , which substitutes for the effect of boundary conditions .",
    "we are working in an arbitrary dimension , but the renormalization will be carried out within the two - dimensional model . in two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ,",
    "in contrast to fluid turbulence , there are direct energy cascades in both two and three dimensions .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect that the scaling behavior is rather similar in both cases , and we apply the same forcing spectrum in all space dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "we use the correlation functions @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 as measurable quantities for the description of turbulence statistics .",
    "we have applied the rg method to the calculation of asymptotic properties of the correlation functions in the way initiated in ref .",
    "this approach is based on a formal mapping from the stochastic model ( [ cor0 ] ) to a quantum - field model  @xcite with a de - dominicis - janssen action @xmath43 , which is a functional of the physical fields @xmath44 , @xmath17 and independent solenoidal auxiliary fields @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the correlation functions ( [ cor2 ] ) can be expressed as functional averages with the `` weight functional '' @xmath47 .",
    "the system of the stochastic mhd equations ( [ nsr ] ) , ( [ magnet ] ) , ( [ nsr1 ] ) , ( [ corel ] ) , and ( [ silan ] ) gives rise to the following de - dominicis - janssen action : @xmath48\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\int\\ !",

    "the action  ( [ action ] ) gives rise to four three - point interaction vertices defined by the standard rules  @xcite , and the following set of propagators @xmath50 in the time - wave - number representation . with due account of galilei invariance of the action",
    "( [ action ] ) , and careful analysis of the structure of the perturbation expansion it can be shown  @xcite that for any fixed space dimension @xmath2 only three one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 with superficial uv divergences are generated by the action .",
    "they give rise to counter terms of the form already present in the action , which thus is multiplicatively renormalizable by power counting for space dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the structure of renormalization should always be analyzed separately and it is not at all obvious that the nonlinear terms are not renormalized in the solution of the stochastic mhd equations .",
    "in fact , direct calculation shows that the lorentz - force term is renormalized .",
    "there seems to be a certain amount of confusion about this point in the recent literature .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors erroneously neglect renormalization of nonlinear terms as high - order effect .",
    "the approach adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite for two - dimensional mhd turbulence was quite recently criticized by kim and young  @xcite , who , alas , in their field - theoretic treatment of the same problem ignore renormalization of the lorentz force without any justification .",
    "they also neglect renormalization of the forcing correlations by effectively considering renormalization of the model at @xmath2 , which does not seem to be appropriate in a setup in which the strictly two - dimensional quantities , the stream function and magnetic potential , are used for the description of the problem .",
    "the analysis of the autocorrelation functions of the velocity field and magnetic induction is essential near two dimensions , since in two dimensions additional divergences in the graphs of the 1pi green functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 occur .",
    "the point here is  @xcite that the nonlocal term of the action ( and the similar one with the auxiliary field @xmath56 ) @xmath57 brought about by the force correlation functions  ( [ corel ] ) is not renormalized since the divergences produced by the loop integrals of the graphs are always local in space and time  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to include the corresponding local counter terms @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the renormalization is to add corresponding _ local _ terms to the force correlation function at the outset in order to keep the model multiplicatively renormalizable , which is convenient technically .",
    "this is why we have used the force correlation functions  ( [ corel ] ) and ( [ silan ] ) with both long - range and short - range correlations . as a result ,",
    "the action  ( [ action ] ) is multiplicatively renormalizable and allows for a standard rg asymptotic analysis  @xcite .    in the momentum - shell analysis of fournier et al .",
    "@xcite these divergences were taken into account only in the special case , when the force correlation function ( [ silan ] ) is local , i.e. @xmath60 ( formally this was fixed by the condition @xmath61 , which excludes @xmath62 from the parameters of the model ) . in the field - theoretic treatment of adzhemyan",
    "@xcite the contribution of the additional divergences was prescribed to a renormalization of the non - analytic term @xmath63 , although only analytic in @xmath34 terms are produced in the course of renormalization .",
    "the model is regularized using a combination of analytic and dimensional regularization with the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "the uv divergences appear as poles in the following linear combinations of the regularizing parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the uv divergences can be removed by adding suitable counterterms to the basic action @xmath66 obtained from the unrenormalized one ( [ action ] ) by the substitution of the renormalized parameters for the bare ones : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath10 is a scale setting parameter having the same canonical dimension as the wave number .    to construct an analog of the usual @xmath1 expansion with @xmath1 and @xmath4 as small parameters of the same order of magnitude",
    ", it is convenient to use the minimal - subtraction ( ms ) scheme for the renormalization . in this approach",
    "only singular parts of the laurent series of the superficially divergent 1pi green functions are included in the renormalization constants , which give rise to the counter terms added to the basic action to make the green functions of the resulting renormalized model uv finite .",

    ", the counter terms ( [ kontra ] ) can be chosen in a form containing a finite number of terms of the same algebraic structure as the terms of the original action ( [ action ] ) .",

    "an attempt to introduce the cutoff , say , in the local part of the correlation functions only by the substitution @xmath190 would fail to renormalize the model multiplicatively , because loop contributions to the complete ( dressed ) correlation function would not reproduce such a structure in the wave - vector space .",

    "this is guaranteed by polchinski s theorem  @xcite .",
    "we retain these counter terms in order to have a possibility to pass to the limit @xmath200 in the rg equations .",
    "the presence of the explicit cutoff implies some technical difficulties in the calculation of the renormalization constants in the traditional field - theoretic approach , which arise because we are dealing with massless vector fields .",
    "it turns out that the coefficient functions of the rg equation are simplest in a renormalization procedure , which is similar to the momentum - shell renormalization of wilson  @xcite .",
    "if we were calculating over the whole wave - vector space without an explicit uv cutoff , there would not be much difference between the effort required in both approaches .",
    "the presence of the uv cutoff makes calculations with nonvanishing external wave vectors rather tedious .",
    "let us remind that the choice of a renormalization procedure basically is the choice of the rule according to which the counter - term contributions are extracted from the perturbation expansion of the green functions of the model .",
    "the usual field - theoretic prescription goes as follows  @xcite : consider a 1pi graph @xmath113 , let @xmath201 be the renormalised value of the graph , and let @xmath202 the value of the graph with subtracted counter terms of all the subgraphs , then @xmath203 where the operator @xmath204 extracts the counter - term contribution from @xmath202 .",
    "usually @xmath205 on one - loop graphs , and the renormalization scheme is specified by the action of @xmath202 on multiloop graphs together with the definition of the operator @xmath204 .",
    "the counter terms may then be constructed recursively with the use of ( [ r ] ) and the definitions of @xmath204 and @xmath202 .",
    "there is rather large freedom in the choice of the counter - term operator , but to arrive at green functions finite in the limit @xmath196 in two dimensions  which we want to have a connection with the double expansion ",
    "the operation @xmath206 must be chosen properly .    here , we have used a renormalization procedure , in which the operation @xmath202 is standard  @xcite , and the subtraction operator @xmath204 is defined as follows : let @xmath207 be the function of external frequencies and wave - vectors ( which also depends on the cutoff parameter @xmath189 ) corresponding to the expression @xmath202 ( this is not a 1pi graph , in general ) .",
    "the subtraction operator @xmath204 extracts the same set of terms of the maclaurin - expansion in the external wave - vectors , which generate the counter terms ( [ kontra ] ) , from the _ difference _ @xmath208 .",
    "these coefficients of the maclaurin - expansion are calculated at vanishing external frequencies and wave - vectors .",
    "it should be noted that the coefficients of this maclaurin expansion of the function @xmath207 itself may not exist in the limit @xmath209 in this `` massless '' model , but the difference @xmath208 allows for a maclaurin expansion finite in the limit @xmath209 to the order required for the renormalization .",
    "the counter - term operator @xmath204 and the combinatorics of the renormalization procedure for higher - order graphs may then be constructed in the standard fashion . although this is actually not needed in the present one - loop calculation ,",
    "the very possibility of this extension is necessary to guarantee that the renormalization renders the model finite in the limit @xmath210 in two dimensions .",
    "effectively , at one - loop order this prescription reduces the region of integration to the momentum shell @xmath211 , which leads to the same calculation as in the momentum - shell renormalization . in higher orders , however , our renormalization scheme does not coincide with the momentum - shell renormalization .",
    "the point of the present renormalization procedure is that without some sort of ir cutoff the subtraction at zero momenta and frequencies is , in general , not possible in a massless model , whereas a subtraction at vanishing frequencies and external momenta of the order of @xmath10 leads to much more complicated calculations due the heavy index structure .    at one - loop accuracy in this scheme",
    "the @xmath113 functions are @xmath212\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_2&=&\\frac{1}{(1+u)b}\\bigl[\\left(d-1\\right)\\left(d+2\\right)\\left(g_{v1}+ g_{v2}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left(d+2\\right)\\left(d-3\\right)\\left(g_{b1}+g_{b2}\\right)\\bigr]\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_3&=&{2\\over b}\\left[g_{b1}+g_{b2}-g_{v1}-g_{v2 } \\right]\\ , , \\label{ggga2}\\\\   \\gamma_4&=&\\frac{d^2 - 2}{2 g_{v2}b}\\left[u\\left(g_{v1}+g_{v2}\\right)^2 +   \\left(g_{b1}+g_{b2}\\right)^2\\right]\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma_5&=&\\frac{2(d-2)(d+2)}{g_{b2}(1+u)b } \\left(g_{b1}+g_{b2}\\right)\\left(g_{v1}+g_{v2}\\right)\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 .",
    "these expressions reveal an additional advantage of this renormalization scheme : at one - loop order there is no explicit dependence on @xmath191 in the coefficient functions of the rg . at one - loop level",
    "a direct comparison with the expressions obtained in the framework of the wilson rg is also possible : the dependence on @xmath214 , @xmath160 , and @xmath215 of the @xmath111 functions @xmath216 , @xmath157 and @xmath217 corresponding to ( [ ggga2 ] ) coincides with that of their counterparts of ref .",
    "@xcite up to notation .",
    "the set of @xmath111 functions generated by ( [ ggga2 ] ) allows for a fixed - point solution in the form of an @xmath1 expansion .",
    "little reflection shows that the fixed - point equations in this case have a self - consistent solution with the following leading - order behavior : @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the actual fixed - point values of @xmath214 , @xmath160 and @xmath215 in the @xmath1 expansion as well as the stability regions with respect to @xmath1 are determined by the same set of equations as in the earlier momentum - shell  @xcite and field - theoretic  @xcite calculation above two dimensions .",
    "the stability condition with respect to the dimension of space of these fixed points is , as expected , @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted that the function @xmath156 is finite in the set ( [ ggga2 ] ) , whereas in the double - expansion approach it was equal to zero [ eq .",
    "( [ g5 ] ) ] .",
    "this means that magnetic fixed points with both @xmath160 and @xmath161 may exist .",
    "in fact , there is one such fixed point stable at high dimensions of space which gives rise to a magnetically driven scaling regime .",
    "this fixed point may be found in the @xmath1 expansion , and we have also investigated its stability numerically . technically speaking , the appearance of a magnetic fixed point with both magnetic couplings nonvanishing would be a completely expected thing to happen in the two - loop approximation , since we have not found any symmetry reasons or the like to prevent the renormalization of the magnetic forcing at higher orders .",
    "thus , to investigate this effect consistently in the @xmath1 expansion would require a full two - loop renormalization of the model , which is beyond the scope of the present analysis .    on the other hand , in the case @xmath223 the set of coefficient functions ( [ ggga2 ] ) yields the coefficient functions ( [ ggga1 ] ) of the double expansion of the previous section .",
    "therefore , we think that it is not totally unreasonable to use the set of coefficient functions ( [ ggga2 ] ) for an analysis of the rg fixed points for all dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the stability of the kinetic fixed point given by ( [ beee1 ] ) and ( [ ggga2 ] ) numerically for a finite range of @xmath1 with results depicted in figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "we think that this calculation , although it is a somewhat uncontrollable approximation , exhibits the effect of the thermal ( short - range ) fluctuations of the fields qualitatively correctly .",
    "the stability of the kinetic scaling regime is strongly affected by the behavior of magnetic fluctuations : from fig.[fig1 ] it is seen that the steeper falloff of the correlations of the magnetic forcing in the wave - vector space compared with that of the kinetic forcing the lower is the space dimension , above which the kinetic fixed point is stable . in particular , when the parameter @xmath224 the kinetic fixed point ceases to be stable even in two dimensions . in three dimensions the kinetic scaling regime is stable against magnetic forcing ,",
    "when @xmath225 .",
    "the monotonic growth of the kinetic - fixed - point value of the inverse magnetic prandtl number @xmath140 as a function of the kinetic forcing - decay parameter in a fixed space dimension is depicted in fig .",
    "the plot shows also that @xmath140 is a monotonically decreasing function of the space dimension at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the lowest - lying curve corresponds to the leading order of the @xmath1 expansion  @xcite @xmath226\\,.\\ ] ] we are particularly interested in the stability of the magnetic fixed point , and have carried out extensive numerical calculations of the stability of this fixed point as a function of @xmath1 and the space dimension @xmath227 .",
    "the results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the magnetic forcing - decay parameter @xmath228 ( i.e. the kinetic - forcing correlations fall off steeper in the wave - vector space than those the magnetic forcing ) and it is seen that for very small @xmath145 a slowly enough decaying kinetic forcing renders the magnetic scaling regime unstable .",
    "in particular , this treshold is very small in three dimensions . with the growth of @xmath145 a strip of stability of the magnetic fixed point in the @xmath1",
    ", @xmath227 plane appears such that the magnetic regime remains stable in three dimensions for all allowed kinetic forcing patterns .",
    "it is also seen that the magnetic fixed point is persistently unstable at @xmath229 for all @xmath1 .",
    "this borderline dimension should be compared with that given by the @xmath1 expansion @xmath6 . from the solution",
    "it can be seen that this significant discrepancy is due to the appearance of a stable magnetic fixed point completely different from that found in the @xmath1 expansion : in the latter the magnetic fixed point is given by @xmath230 and @xmath231 , whereas at the magnetic fixed point , whose stability is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , only @xmath232 with nonvanishing fixed - point values of the other couplings .",
    "thus , the lowering of the borderline dimension of stability of the magnetic scaling regime is a strong effect of the thermal fluctuations described by the short - range terms in the forcing correlation functions .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the lower boundary of the stability region of the magnetic fixed point for large values of @xmath145 , when magnetic - forcing correlations fall off much faster that kinetic - forcing correlations in the wave - vector space .",
    "a remarkable feature of both plots is the insensitivity of the lower border of the stability strip to the value of magnetic forcing - decay parameter @xmath145 .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out a rg analysis of the large - scale asymptotic behavior of the solution of stochastically forced magnetohydrodynamic equations for all space dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "we have taken into account the additional divergences appearing in two dimensions ignored or improperly treated in previous work . in a two - parameter expansion scheme",
    "we have found three infrared - stable fixed points in the physically relevant region of the parameter space spanned by the forcing parameters and the inverse magnetic prandtl number .",
    "anomalous scaling behavior is brought about in the basins of attraction of the thermal and kinetic fixed points , the former of which is due to thermal fluctuations , and the latter due to long - range correlated random forcing of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the thermal fixed point is related to the anomalous asymptotic behavior due to thermal fluctuations near two dimensions . with a proper choice of the force - correlation function",
    "the regime governed by the kinetic fixed point may be related to developed isotropic turbulence in a conducting fluid .",
    "we have obtained the stability condition of the kinetic fixed point near two dimensions with respect to the magnetic forcing - decay parameter as @xmath233 , which coincides with that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but differs from the result of ref .",
    "@xcite .    we have also put forward an interpolation scheme , which reproduces the earlier results in the case of an @xmath1 expansion in any fixed space dimension @xmath2 , and the results of the present paper in the two - parameter expansion in @xmath1 and @xmath3 near two dimensions . using this interpolation approach we have qualitatively analysed the dependence of the stability of the kinetic and magnetic scaling regimes on the forcing - decay parameters and the dimension of space and found that thermal fluctuations drastically lower the borderline dimension of stability of the magnetic scaling regime .",
