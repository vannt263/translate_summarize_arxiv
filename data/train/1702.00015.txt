    "the radio - loud quasar pks  0637@xmath0752 ( @xmath2=0.651 ) was the first astrophysical source observed by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , shortly after its launch in 1999 .",
    "this source also gave us _",
    "chandra s _ first scientific discovery , as it unexpectedly detected a kpc - scale x - ray jet associated with pks  0637@xmath0752 , with a very high x - ray flux level and hard ( @xmath3 ) spectrum which precluded it being the tail of the radio - optical synchrotron spectrum @xcite .",
    "nearly twenty years later , _",
    "chandra _ has now discovered several dozen more ` anomalous ' x - ray jets , typically in powerful quasar sources , where the hard - spectrum x - ray flux is clearly from a second component , distinct from the radio - optical synchrotron spectrum which turns over before the infrared ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .    in the initial discovery papers on pks  0637@xmath0752 , @xcite and @xcite ruled out thermal brehmstrahlung , synchrotron self - compton , and inverse compton off the cosmic microwave background ( ic / cmb ) from a mildly relativistic flow as possible explanations for the anomalous x - ray flux in the jet , leaving open the possibility of a second synchrotron spectrum from an apparently co - spatial second electron energy distribution .",
    "@xcite and @xcite independently revisited the ic / cmb mechanism , finding that it could be consistent with the x - ray flux if the kpc - scale jet remains highly relativistic , with bulk lorentz factors @xmath410 , and the jet is pointed within a few degrees of our line - of - sight .",
    "this version of the ic / cmb model has become by far the most popular explanation for the anomalous x - ray jets , always requiring small viewing angles and high bulk @xmath5 values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the ic / cmb model has come under criticism for several reasons , including unrealistically high jet power requirements , inability to explain jet - to - counterjet ratios in less highly beamed members of the parent source population , difficulty matching the ` knotty ' jet structure , and unusually long jet lengths implied by the small viewing angle @xcite .",
    "however , until recently there was no clear test of the ic / cmb model .",
    "the central difficulty is that both ic / cmb and a double - synchrotron models are able to reproduce the observed radio to x - ray seds of large - scale - jets equally well ( e.g. , see direct comparison in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , hereafter g06 suggested that the _ fermi_/lat would be able to break the degeneracy between these two models , by looking for the required high level of gamma - ray flux under the ic / cmb interpretation , which is obviously not expected under a second - synchrotron scenario .",
    "the _ fermi _ test is extremely powerful because there are no free parameters at all involved in the predicted gamma - ray flux level : the ic / cmb spectrum is essentially an exact copy of the synchrotron spectrum , shifted in frequency and luminosity proportionally to @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ( where @xmath8 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath9 the doppler factor ) , and hence the requirement to set the normalization of the ic / cmb spectrum to match the x - ray flux completely fixes the gamma - ray flux level .",
    "an upper limit _ or _ a detection by _ fermi _ significantly below the expected level at gev energies would clearly rule out an ic / cmb origin for the anomalous x - rays .    in recent work",
    ", we have used upper limits from _ fermi _ to rule out ic / cmb as the source of the kpc - scale x - rays at the @xmath1099.99% level in 3c  273 , and at the 99.98% level in pks  0637@xmath0752 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m15 ) .",
    "although _ fermi _ lacks the spatial resolution to detect the large - scale jet separately from the gamma - ray bright cores in these sources , we were able to derive deep upper limits using times when the cores were quiescent . in this letter , we present new alma observations and updated limits from _ fermi_/lat which show that our original claims can be strengthened , and that ic / cmb is now ruled out in pks  0637@xmath0752 at the 8.7@xmath1 level .",
    "we describe here new observations obtained from alma and the _",
    "fermi_/lat for pks  0637@xmath0752 .",
    "all other data are taken from m15 and references therein .",
    "pks0637@xmath0752 is a bright southern source which is routinely used as an alma calibrator .",
    "the alma data used in this paper have been taken from almacal , a wide and deep submm survey which is being carried out using alma calibration observations @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on data extraction and calibration .",
    "briefly , for each scheduling block of a given science project , we run the alma pipeline and extract the calibrated visibilities of all calibrators used",
    ". then a run of self - calibration is carried out ( always possible thanks to the brightness of the calibrators ) and the dominant point - source component at the phase centre is subtracted from the calibrated visibilities .",
    "this subtraction is necessary to combine data taken in different configurations ( and therefore different times ) due to the variability of the core . finally , for a given calibrator , we combine all available visibilities on each band to create a deep image ( natural weighing is used during imaging ) . in the current phase of almacal ,",
    "there is available data for pks0637@xmath0752 in alma bands 3 ( @xmath11 ) , 6 ( @xmath12 ) and 7 ( @xmath13 ) . the sensitivity and beam size of each map ( shown in figure  [ fig : imaging ] ) are : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .     _",

    "for all measurements , the error on the flux is dominated by the error on the absolute flux scale calibration ; current estimates suggest 10% as the maximum value , which we use for all alma fluxes presented in this paper .      to get the deepest possible upper limits ( or lowest detected flux level ) for the gamma - ray output of the combined pks  0637@xmath0752 core and jet",
    ", we utilize the ` progressive - binning ' approach first described in @xcite , which can be consulted for further details as well as m15 .",

    "we iteratively fit for the sky position and spectral parameters for any new source ( as shown by a ts residual over @xmath2110 ) using a maximum - likelihood approach as described in m15 .",
    "we added 13 new sources to the base model populated with 3fgl catalog sources supplied by the ` make3fglxml ` tool , with the nearest being a ts=19 source at 3.45 degrees from pks  0637@xmath0752 .    with our updated source model",

    "since the cut - off time corresponding to the m15 study ( vertical red line ) , almost 26 months have passed in which the pks  0637@xmath0752 core has remained relatively quiescent .",
    "we ordered the 155 light curve bins according to ts and then progressively combined them in our analysis , combining first the lowest two , then lowest three , and so on . at each step in the combined binning , where one additional bin is included in to the analysis",
    ", we compute the maximum - likelihood flux for pks  0637@xmath0752 using a power - law model with a fixed spectral index of 2.7 . at each step",
    "we also compute the flux or 95% upper limit in five individual energy bands corresponding to 0.1 - 0.3  gev , 0.3 - 1  gev , 1 - 3  gev , 3 - 10  gev , and 10 - 100  gev , matching those used in the published _ fermi _ catalogs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : newcurves ] , we show the results of the progressive binning analysis as 95% upper limits versus time , up until a flux with ts=10 is detected , at which point we show detections with error bars .",
    "the lowest limits in each of the five energy bands were reached after 31 , 52 , 60 , 53 , and 56 total bins were combined , respectively .",
    "the corresponding 95% upper limit fluxes , plotted in red in figure  [ fig : mainresult ] , are listed in table  [ table : limits ] .     here",

    "as shown , the typical behavior in all energy bins is to show decreasing upper limits with time , reaching a minimum , and then increasing up to the point that the source reached a test significance greater than 10 in that band ( points shown with error bars ) .",

    "we present in figure  [ fig : mainresult ] the updated sed for the four brightest knots ( black lines ) and for the single x - ray brightest knot wk8.9 ( cyan lines ) .",
    "the new alma data have been overplotted in dark yellow ; note that they fall nearly exactly on the synchrotron model curves which are unchanged from m15 .",
    "the radio and ir / optical data shown as solid points are also unchanged from the previous paper .    with the addition of the alma data points",
    ", we can now say that the synchrotron seds are quite well - constrained , as the data gap between alma and ir frequencies is comparable to the spectral width of synchrotron emission from a monoenergetic electron population and the actual flux there can not deviate significantly from our empirical sed .",
    "the empirical ( by eye ) fit is simply a power - law with a scaled exponential cutoff ,    @xmath22    for the four knots , the parameter values are @xmath23  erg  s@xmath24  @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27  hz , and @xmath28 . for the single knot the values are @xmath29  erg  s@xmath24  @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath30  hz , and @xmath31 .",
    "the radio index of the empirical model between 8.6 and 17.8 ghz is 0.245 , consistent with that based on the two atca radio points alone , which yields @xmath32=0.24@xmath330.05 .",
    "based on the empirical fits to the synchrotron spectra shown , we have produced corresponding ( empirical ) ic / cmb model curves , shown as thicker black and cyan lines from x - ray to tev energies using the shift formulae given in g06 .",
    "recalling that the requirement that the ic / cmb curves match the observed x - ray flux completely fixes the gev - band prediction , we can now examine the upper limits from _",
    "fermi_. the previous m15 limits are shown in gray , while the new , deeper limits from the most recent analysis are shown in magenta .",
    "clearly , the ic / cmb model is ruled out at a very high level of significance .",
    "taking the predicted model curves shown in figure  [ fig : mainresult ] for the ic / cmb spectrum , we can calculate the significance of our non - detection in each energy band using the profile likelihood method .",
    "with @xmath34 equal to the logarithm of the likelihood , the statistic @xmath35 is distributed as a @xmath36 with one degree of freedom when all other parameters are fixed .",
    "the value of the normalization of the source is increased until the flux equals the predicted value , and we record the resulting @xmath35 value , which is converted into a percent probability and sigma value for a one - sided limit using standard @xmath36 tables .",
    "for the four brightest knots in the jet combined , the deepest single - band limit is in band 3 , where our upper limit implies that ic / cmb is ruled out at the 5.6@xmath1 level .",
    "overall , ic / cmb is ruled out at a 8.7@xmath1 limit when we combine the individual band results using the inverse normal method .",
    "for the single brightest knot , the deepest single limit is also in band 3 , equivalent to a 99.97% or 3.5@xmath1 upper limit .",
    "the combined results of all bands using the inverse normal method implies an overall 5.3@xmath1 upper limit for the single x - ray brightest knot .    because of jet one - sidedness ,",
    "we know that the large - scale jet must be at least mildly relativistic , and thus some level of ic / cmb emission will be produced , even if it is not responsible for the anomalous x - rays .",
    "we can use the updated _ fermi _ limits to put an upper limit on the value of @xmath9 assuming the magnetic field is in equipartition , with @xmath37 g ( where we have assumed a knot radius of 3.5 kpc , a spectral index of @xmath38 and @xmath39 = 100 ) . for the 95% limits shown in figure  [ fig : mainresult ] , the limit for the four brightest knots is @xmath40 .",

    "* hereafter l17 ) where it is argued that the ic / cmb model is not ruled out for pks  0637@xmath0752 , based on the m15 limits shown in gray .. however , the radio  sub - mm model spectra of l17 are significantly steeper ( or more flat in @xmath44 ) than the actual data require , substantially underproducing the alma fluxes .",
    "this is critical , as this part of the synchrotron spectrum determines the sed slope below the peak and therefore , the rise of the high energy energy component from the x - ray to gev energies .",
    "in other words , adopting a steeper - than - observed radio spectrum reduces the anticipated gev emission for a given level of x - rays and can lead to incorrect conclusions for the viability of the ic / cmb model .",
    "the radio spectral index at the low radio frequencies ( @xmath451 ghz ) corresponding to the same electrons that produce the x - rays is @xmath46=0.65 in our empirical model , compared to a value of approximately 0.87 used in l17 .",
    "the latter value is close to the x - ray spectral index value of @xmath47=0.85@xmath330.1 reported in @xcite , as required under the standard ic / cmb model .",
    "it should be noted that , in the context of the ic / cmb model , the inferred radio index is already in some tension with the x - ray spectral index , as seen in figure  [ fig : mainresult ] .",
    "we now address the question of whether models that include some physical considerations such as electron energy losses can alter our conclusions .",
    "this was suggested by l17 , in particular that radiative losses steepen the high - energy end of the electron energy distribution , resulting to suppressed gev emission .",
    "the problem with this argument is that there is a single electron energy distribution that is required to produce both the synchrotron and the ic / cmb components , and the steepness of the high - energy tail of the eed is uniquely determined by the ir - optical _ observed spectrum _ , so that the synchrotron sed determines the ic / cmb sed .",
    "thus , regardless of the way one fits the synchrotron spectrum , the ic / cmb sed will be a copy of the synchrotron one with the degree of shifting set by the requirement that the ic / cmb reproduces the x - rays ( g06 ) . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have shifted the l17 numerical synchrotron sed of knot wk8.9 according to the expressions of g06 so that it reproduces the x - ray emission of the knot .",
    "the result is plotted in figure [ fig : mainresult ] as a dashed red line . as expected , this line is extremely close to the numerical ic / cmb result of l17 .",
    "we have presented new alma observations of the anomalously x - ray - bright quasar jet pks  0637@xmath0752 at 100 and 233 ghz .",
    "these observations confirm that the bright knots of this source have a synchrotron peak at approximately @xmath48 hz and are consistent with the empirical model presented in m15 .",
    "we have presented new _",
    "upper limits on pks  0637@xmath0752 for the large - scale jet using the progressive binning method .",
    "these limits improve on those previously reported in m15 through both more time on source , and the use of ` pass 8 ' calibration for the _ fermi _ data .",
    "the updated limits represent a combined 8.7@xmath1-level ruling out of the standard ic / cmb model , which we find does not produce the required gamma - ray emission .",
    "a recent claim for the opposite ( l17 ) stems from using a dataset that did not include critical alma observations and from using an incorrect radio spectral index ( see  [ importanceofsed ] ) .",
    "we also note that for the purpose of evaluating the standard ic / cmb model , an empirical description of the synchrotron sed is equivalent to physical models ( see  [ numerical ] ) .",
