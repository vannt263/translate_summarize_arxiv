    "the loud consequences of the instability of the monochromatic townes beam @xcite in self - focusing kerr media under perturbations in space catastrophic collapse or diffraction , as well as the central role played by the townes profile in the theory of self - similar collapse @xcite , have probably overshadowed its relevance in other contexts .",
    "the townes beam suffers also from an instability under small spatiotemporal perturbations , which was predicted in @xcite , but only studied in detail recently .",
    "@xcite in its initial stages of growth , a linear instability analysis showed that the spatiotemporal instability is characterized by two weak , y - shaped unstable modes that can grow exponentially .",
    "these weak y - shaped modes have been seen to account for the incipient spatiotemporal dynamics observed in a seemingly stationary , self - guided light beam @xcite ( e.g. , a light filament ) , which includes the onset of spectral broadening and of conical emission , and the seed for temporal break - up [ see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for these phenomena ] . in numerical simulations ,",
    "weak y - shaped wave modes have been seen to develop from spatiotemporal perturbations to a townes beam . @xcite in experiments , the single and double y - shaped structures observed in the spatiotemporal spectra of light filaments immediately after collapse are compatible with the formation of the unstable modes of the newly formed self - trapped beam .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we take a step forward by studying the spatiotemporal instability of the townes beam in its nonlinear regime of development , where the amplitude of the perturbation becomes comparable to , or higher than the amplitude of the townes beam , and the energy lost by the townes beam is not negligible . assuming from @xcite that the y unstable modes have grown up to a small amplitude , we show here that they develop into two giant , splitting ( subluminal and superluminal ) y pulses that exhibit broadened spectra and shocks fronts on opposite sides",
    "moreover , the nonlinear interaction between each y pulse and the townes beam results in the exponential amplification of two x waves with super - broad spectra that co - propagate with the shocking y pulses .",
    "the townes beam , the y pulses and the x waves are seen to coexist during the propagation , interacting strongly in a highly phase - matched and group - matched configuration .",
    "the spatiotemporal dynamics of y pulses and x waves are found to resemble very closely the observed dynamics of light filaments , from their formation up to their later stages of proapgation .",
    "@xcite    thus , though mathematically complex , the theory on the spatiotemporal instability of a self - guided light beam in @xcite ( linear regime ) and in the present paper ( nonlinear regime ) can explain from minimum ingredients ( diffraction , dispersion and the kerr nonlinearity ) the origin of the basic phenomena observed in the spatiotemporal dynamics of a self - guided light beam , though their quantitative description would require , of course , the inclusion of all relevant higher - order effects , as higher - order dispersion , plasma defocusing , nonlinear absorption , etc .",
    "after recalling briefly the linear instability analysis ( sec . [ linear ] ) , we first study by analytical and numerical means the nonlinear regime of growth of a single y perturbation at a single frequency to the townes beam ( sec . [ nonlinear ] ) .",
    "the results allows us to understand the most general case of the nonlinear development of the two unstable y modes when excited at a continuous of frequencies ( sec . [ multiple ] ) .",
    "we recall that the monochromatic townes beam @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transversal townes profile , and @xmath2 for @xmath3 @xcite , is a transversally localized , self - guided solution to the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , which for a wave @xmath4 with revolution symmetry about the propagation direction @xmath5 , reads as @xmath6 the term with the second derivative with respect to the local time @xmath7 accounts for normal group velocity dispersion in the non - monochromatic case .",

    "contrarily to a standard gaussian pulse , the positive and negative frequencies in the spectrum of each y pulse experience group velocity dispersions of opposite signs . for the y pulse @xmath147 ,",

    "thus , differently from a gaussian pulse , opposite portions of the spectrum travel at identical inverse group velocities along the @xmath5-direction ( @xmath152 for @xmath147 ) , which prevents from any pulse broadening associated to pulse chirping .",

    "broadening of y pulses is caused by a chirp in the beatings between each couple of frequencies @xmath11 due to a dispersion in the beating group velocity , i.e. , to a frequency - dependent group velocity @xmath156 for the beatings in the y pulse @xmath147 , and @xmath157 for beatings in the y pulse @xmath146 .",

    "splitting with a certain group velocity mismatch appears here as an intrinsic feature of the unstable y modes that can grow from ( non - splitting ) perturbations at noise level .",
    "these alternative theories have been seen to admit also a simple interpretation in terms of a three - wave mixing interaction ( rather than four - wave mixing ) , @xcite in which an x wave results from the scattering of an incident wave by a split - off ( nonlinear polarization ) pulse , which predicts a linear growth of the x wave , @xcite against the exponential and growth obtained from the present theory .",
