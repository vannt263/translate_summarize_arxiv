    "young star clusters are potentially bright , long lived , tracers of star formation within their host galaxies .",
    "it is therefore of paramount importance to understand what governs the cluster formation process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and how the host galactic environment may affect their formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "statistically we can describe the cluster formation as a stochastic process .",
    "numerous works report of an initial cluster mass and luminosity function ( icmf and iclf , respectively ) being described with good approximation by a single power - law slope of index close to @xmath3 .",
    "the stochastic nature of cluster formation combined with the power - law distributions of the cluster mass generate the so called size - of - sample effects .",
    "these effects are well described by the positive relations between the number of clusters @xcite or the youngest brightest cluster in v band , m@xmath8 , versus the galactic star formation rate ( sfr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , galaxies with higher sfr have more numerous cluster populations , therefore they are more likely to sample the icmf at higher mass ( luminosity ) ranges",
    ". the size - of - sample effect also applies to the time - binning of the cluster population .",
    "massive clusters are statistically more likely to be older because the galaxy has had a longer period of time to sample the high mass bins of the icmf @xcite .",
    "increasing evidence , however , suggests that this is not the full picture .",
    "a steepening at the bright luminosity bins of the iclf has widely been observed and reported .",
    "this steepening could be explained by the presence of a truncation at the high mass end of the icmf .",
    "indeed , the presence of a truncation mass may explain why we do not observe very massive young star clusters close to @xmath9 mass in the milky way @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to establish the presence of a truncation due to low number statistics @xcite .",
    "several works report an icmf compatible with a schechter function of slope @xmath3 , and an exponential cutoff at masses above a certain characteristic mass , .",
    "interestingly it has been observed by these authors that may change as function of the host galactic environment .",
    "such an environmental dependence would be expected theoretically due to the variation of the maximum mass scale for gravitational instability in galaxy discs ( the `` toomre mass '' , toomre 1964 ) , which should lead to an increase of the maximum cluster mass with the gas pressure ( kruijssen 2014 ) .",
    "more evidence of the role played by the galactic environment on the properties of their cluster population has indirectly been suggested by the so called t@xmath10(u ) versus sfr relation @xcite .",
    "t@xmath10(u ) is the fraction of u band light locked in star clusters with respect to the total u band light of the galaxy .",
    "this fraction is observed to increase as function of the sfr of the galaxy , suggesting that the fraction of star formation happening in clusters ( hereafter or cluster formation efficiency , cfe ) is increasing @xcite .",
    "indeed direct evidence of a varying cfe as function of the average galactic star formation rate density ( @xmath11 ) has been observed in numerous galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .    in the model proposed by @xcite a variation in the cfe",
    "is directly linked to the star and cluster formation process itself .",
    "this model describes star and cluster formation continuously across the density spectrum of the hierarchically structured ism , in which the highest star formation efficiencies ( and thus bound stellar fractions ) are reached in the highest density peaks .",
    "integration of these local physics over the gas density spectrum then results in a cfe that increases with the gas surface density or pressure , as well as the sfr density ( kruijssen 2012 ) .",
    "given the density gradient observed in disc galaxies , the model thus predicts that the cfe decreases with the galactocentric radius .",
    "indeed , using a small fraction of the whole cluster population of m83 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sv13 ) report evidence of such a variation of the cfe as function of galactocentric distances .",
    "the aim of this article is to probe the imprints that the galactic environment leaves on the properties of its cluster population .",
    "the results will shed light on how the star cluster population is a natural outcome of the physics driving galactic star formation , and will also help to use star cluster populations as tracers of the sfh of their host galaxies . to achieve this goal we study the cluster population of the nearby ( @xmath12 mpc , corresponding to a distance modulus of 28.28 mag ) spiral galaxy m83 .",
    "this galaxy hosts a rich cluster population which has been widely analysed in recent years .",
    "several studies suggest that the current ongoing starburst at the centre of this galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was mostly likely produced by a recent minor merger @xcite . outside this region",
    "the most active star - forming regions in the galaxy are at the end of the bar ( see figure  [ fig : m83 ] ) .",
    "however , we notice that star formation is occurring over the entire spiral arm system and in spurs extended inside the inter - arm regions , as in m51 @xcite .    only recently",
    "m83 has been fully observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) with broad and narrow imaging bands covering from the @xmath13 to the @xmath14 and several optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the cluster population have therefore focused on the two pointings f1 and f2 ( see figure  [ fig : m83 ] ) .",
    "@xcite report of a similar icmf and cluster disruption rate in both inner ( f1 ) and outer ( f2 ) fields .",
    "they notice a steepening of the icmf slope and a milder disruption rate in f2 , but they conclude that within the uncertainties the results support a cluster formation and evolution scenario independent of the galactic environment . with a similar cluster catalogue ( comparison presented in both @xcite ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b12 ) point out the differences in the photometric properties , icmf and iclf , disruption rate of the cluster populations in the two pointings .",
    "the differences can not be accounted for by a recent , significant change in the sfh , so are therefore most likely linked to the cluster formation and disruption properties of the local galactic environment .",
    "such a change in cluster properties is also supported by the change in the cfe as function of distance from the centre of the galaxy observed by sv13 .",
    "the access to a full cluster catalogue for m83 now allows us to verify and put stronger constraints on previous findings . using the whole m83 cluster catalogue , ( *",
    "* hereafter sv14 ) find a clear environmental dependency on the strength of the cluster disruption with higher cluster disruption in the inner regions of the galaxy , as already suggested by b12 . in a recent publication ,",
    "@xcite has studied the h@xmath15 morphology of the very young star clusters in m83 , reporting that clusters are already partially or fully exposed within a few myr after their formation .",
    "ryon et al ( 2015 ) has focused on the analysis of m83 cluster sizes , important for the dynamical evolution of these systems . in the present work",
    "we will expand the icmf analysis published by b12 and the analysis of the cfe by sv13 to the whole cluster population within the m83 disk .",
    "all together , these works are presenting an unprecedentedly detailed and complete study of the cluster population of a nearby galaxy .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the photometric analysis and the properties of the final cluster catalogue .",
    "we also include a description of the ancillary data used in the analysis . in section 3",
    ", we present our results .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of the results within the wider context of cluster and star formation in galaxies .",
    "a summary of the paper is presented in the conclusions ( section 5 ) .",
    "this analysis is based on the complete m83 cluster catalogue recently published in sv14 .",
    "the final cluster catalogue has been obtained from two multi - band hst imaging datasets , ( go 11360 , pi : oconnell , and go 12513 , pi : blair ) .",
    "the two combined datasets cover within 7 pointings the face - on m83 disk up to a distance of 4.5 kpc ( 3.4 ) from the centre of the galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : m83 ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "our analysis is based on wfc3 imaging in 5 optical bands , f336w ( hereafter @xmath16 band ) , f438w ( @xmath17 band ) , f555w or f547 m ( @xmath18 band ) , f657n ( narrow filter centred on h@xmath15 ) , and f814w ( hereafter @xmath19 band ) .",
    "cluster detection has been performed on the v band with optimised parameter inputs of the source extraction algorithm sextractor . for each extracted source",
    ", aperture photometry has been performed in all the bands with an aperture radius of 5 px ( 0.2@xmath20 4.4 pc ) and a sky annulus located at 8 px ( 0.32 ) and 2 px ( 0.08 ) wide .",
    "isolated compact clusters , visually selected , were used to estimate and add the amount of missed flux lost because of the small aperture size used . moreover",
    "small differences in calibration between different pointings were corrected as explained in sv14 .",
    "the final catalogue retains only sources with a concentration index larger than 1.25 mag and positive detections in 4 filters ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we consider detection in h@xmath15 as additional but not required constraint .",
    "the vega zero points used to flux calibrate the photometry have been retrieved from the wfc3 instrument webpage . milky way foreground extinction correction has been applied @xcite .",
    "as described in sv14 , the initial catalogue has been visually inspected and each source has been assigned a flag describing the morphology of the cluster .",
    "class 1 objects are clusters with symmetric and compact light distribution .",
    "class 1 objects are most likely bound clusters as tested in b12 .",
    "class 2 objects show asymmetries in the light distribution , multiple peaks , potentially contaminant neighbours .",
    "these objects closely resemble ob associations , therefore there is a fair chance of them being unbound @xcite .",
    "class 3 objects are spurious detections ( bad pixels mostly located at the end of the chip , background and foreground sources ) and have been removed from the final catalogue .",
    "any cluster candidate located within a radius of 0.45 kpc has also been excluded from the catalogue .",
    "we excluded this region because of the high luminosity gradient which causes a change in the completeness of the cluster detection and because of the different sfh that this region has experienced ( b12 ) .",
