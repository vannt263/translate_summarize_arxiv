    "ensembles of trapped , laser - cooled atomic particles provide some of the best - controlled experimental platforms to study quantum dynamics , to engineer effective interactions , or to generate specific quantum states @xcite .",
    "an essential requirement for such levels of control is the efficient isolation of the system from its environment , whose detrimental influence leads to the decay of coherent superpositions @xcite .",
    "the loss of coherence often also implies the loss of quantum correlations , such as entanglement , which are required , e.g. , to process quantum information .",
    "one persistently dominant source of error , common to most experiments on trapped atomic particles , is caused by intensity fluctuations of external electromagnetic fields , which are needed to lift degeneracies , to compensate background fields , or to manipulate the quantum state of the system @xcite . since such fields",
    "are typically generated by large coils outside the vacuum chamber , the resulting field is spatially homogeneous along the positions of the trapped particles .",
    "the unavoidable fluctuations of the field strength therefore lead to a _ collective _ dephasing process , which is formally described by an ensemble average over the fluctuating parameter @xcite .",
    "the collective nature of this noise provides new possibilities to protect coherent superpositions @xcite , and , as demonstrated in a recent experiment @xcite , to generate robust , strongly correlated , albeit separable quantum states .    in this article",
    "we study the impact of the collective dephasing process on different types of correlations inscribed into quantum states , using the analytical description of the collective dephasing dynamics outlined in @xcite .",
    "our analysis focuses on the correlation rank , which in turn entails direct consequences for the discord - type correlations @xcite .",
    "specifically , in sec .",
    "[ sec : generate ] , we study how strongly correlated two - qubit states can be generated via collective dephasing , as a function of tunable external control parameters , e.g. , the magnetic field direction .",
    "we discuss specific applications of the produced quantum states in the context of quantum information protocols . in sec .",
    "[ sec : generalk ] we follow a complementary approach and analyse the protection of existing correlations during the collective dephasing process .",
    "we further discuss robust conditions that lead to the striking phenomenon of _ time - invariant _ entanglement : the perfect conservation of the initial entanglement , even for states whose purity is reduced due to the dephasing process .",
    "we begin by reviewing different notions of correlations in quantum states that will become relevant in the course of this article . _",
    "quantum entanglement _ captures the non - classical correlations of a quantum state in a composite hilbert space @xmath0 , i.e. , it expresses the inability to characterize the full quantum state @xmath1 via a classical probability distribution @xmath2 and local density operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the local hilbert spaces @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in particular , a quantum state is _ separable _",

    "this measure , the _ concurrence _ , is determined on the basis of the eigenvalues @xmath9 of @xmath10 , labelled in decreasing order , where the spin - flipped state @xmath11 is obtained by collective application of the pauli matrix @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and complex - conjugation is performed in the computational basis .",
    "the concurrence of the state @xmath1 is then given by @xmath14 .",
    "for higher dimensional problems , only algebraic lower bounds are available @xcite .",
    "the _ quantum discord _ describes the disturbance of local measurements on quantum states of composite systems @xcite .",
    "as we will see in the following , these features related to the quantum - mechanical measurement process can be expressed via non - vanishing commutators , and can only occur in correlated quantum states .",
    "they can , however , also manifest in separable states that exhibit only classical correlations , and therefore describe a more general type of quantum properties than entanglement .",
    "formally , a state @xmath1 has zero discord if it can be written as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath17 .",
    "this definition is equivalent to the following : a state @xmath1 has zero discord if and only if there exists a non - selective local projective measurement on @xmath17 that leaves the state invariant , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "the definition presented here considers measurements on @xmath5 and is straight - forwardly extended to measurements on @xmath6 . due to the asymmetry of the definition",
    ", one should always specify in which subsystem measurements are performed , when discussing quantum discord .",
    "notice that every zero - discord state is separable but the converse is not true .",
    "the two concepts coincide only in the case of pure states .",
    "in contrast to entanglement , local operations on one of the subsystems can generate discord @xcite , which confirms that discord is not a proper measure for correlations . to quantify the correlations of a bipartite quantum state",
    ", we employ the rank of an appropriately constructed correlation matrix ( the _ correlation rank _ ) , which is the minimal number of bipartite operator products needed to describe the density operator @xcite . for the formal definition ,",
    "we write the density operator @xmath1 in an arbitrary basis of local hermitian operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the correlation matrix , a real - valued @xmath25-dimensional matrix whose rank @xmath26 is then called the correlation rank @xcite . employing a singular value decomposition , we find non - zero singular values @xmath27 and orthogonal matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the above decomposition can be regarded as a schmidt decomposition of a density matrix in terms of local operator bases @xcite .",
    "a more familiar application of the schmidt decomposition is known for pure bipartite quantum states , which are decomposed in terms of local vectors .",
    "the associated singular value decomposition yields the schmidt rank , which quantifies how entangled a pure state is .",
    "consequently , the correlation rank stands in close analogy to the schmidt rank . in general",
    ", the correlation rank does not quantify entanglement but rather total correlations , i.e. , any incompatibility with an uncorrelated product state , without an explicit distinction between classical and quantum nature of the correlations .",
    "in the special case of a pure state one obtains @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes that state s schmidt rank @xcite .",
    "conclusions about the local quantum nature of the state can be drawn from the correlation rank by realizing that its maximal value is bounded from above for all zero - discord states .",
    "generally , the correlation rank can not exceed @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "however , as can be seen from the definition  ( [ eq.zerodiscord ] ) , states of zero discord with respect to measurements on @xmath38 are represented in terms of local projectors @xmath39 onto orthogonal subspaces . since there exist",
    "no more than @xmath40 orthogonal subspaces in @xmath38 , the correlation rank of zero - discord states is bounded by @xmath41 .",
    "this is directly related to the observation that the operators @xmath42 , which appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq.svd ] ) , can be used to assess the discord of @xmath1 : the state @xmath1 has zero discord ( with respect to measurements on @xmath5 ) if and only if all of the @xmath42 commute @xcite .",
    "while local operations can not increase the correlation rank @xmath26 @xcite , they can change the commutativity of the local operators @xmath42 , and thereby generate discord @xcite without actually generating correlations @xcite .",
    "the correlation rank allows to distinguish separable states with high correlation rank ( @xmath43 ) from those that can be generated from states of zero discord via local operations , as characterized by a low correlation rank ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "separable operations of the form @xmath44 , with local operations @xmath45 and @xmath46 , can generate classical correlations among the particles and , consequently , are able to increase the correlation rank @xcite .",
    "the collective dephasing operation to be discussed in this article represents such a separable operation .",
    "the density operator of any bipartite system can be represented in terms of the operator bases @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denote vectors whose entries are the generators of su(@xmath40 ) , and @xmath49 denote the respective identity operators .",

    ", we mostly employ the reduced bloch vectors and the @xmath53-matrix to investigate the impact of the collective dephasing process , which allows for an intuitive geometric description . a tool that we often employ to simplify our analysis are local _ unitary _ transformations , since these affect neither the state s entanglement properties ( by definition ) nor its correlation rank ( as we show explicitly later ) .",
    "following @xcite , we consider transformations @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "for every unitary transformation @xmath66 , there exists a rotation @xmath67 on the respective ( generalized ) bloch sphere such that @xmath68 .",
    "we then obtain the following transformation rules : @xmath69 if two matrices @xmath53 and @xmath70 can be transformed into each other by such an operation , we write @xmath71 . in particular , we can always diagonalize the @xmath53 matrix by applying unitary transformations to the underlying quantum state .",
    "we now show that such transformations do not change the rank of the correlation matrix .",
    "if @xmath72 , we have @xmath73    the rank of @xmath74 is defined by the image of the linear map @xmath75 : @xmath76 since @xmath67 and @xmath77 are orthogonal matrices , we have @xmath78 since the maps @xmath79 and @xmath80 are bijective , we finally obtain @xmath81    in the following , we analyse the impact of the collective dephasing process , to be introduced in the next section , on the different concepts that were introduced in this section , all of which are intimately related to correlations in quantum states .",
    "collective dephasing describes the dynamics of @xmath82 particles that share the same environment , but experience no direct particle - particle interactions among each other . the environment does not induce exchange of energy with the particles , and hence does not lead to dissipation , but rather to pure dephasing , i.e. , loss of phase relations without loss of populations .",
    "a physically relevant example of such a scenario was already mentioned in the introduction : when an ensemble of atomic dipoles is spatially confined in a region where the electromagnetic field is homogeneous , all dipoles share the same transition frequency .",
    "the fluctuations of the field then lead to a collective dephasing process @xcite .",
    "the quantum state that predicts the measurement results after many experimental repetitions is described by the ensemble average over the actual realisations of these fluctuations @xcite .",
    "let us consider magnetic dipoles , described by two - level systems , in a constant magnetic field @xmath83 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath84 of the @xmath82-particle system is given by @xmath85 , with @xmath86 , where here @xmath87 is a vector of pauli matrices on the hilbert space of the @xmath88th particle , and further constants are absorbed into @xmath89 . identifying @xmath90 , with @xmath91 ,",
    "we write @xmath92 for a fixed magnetic field strength @xmath93 , the fully coherent dynamics of the total system is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath82-particle density operator at time @xmath96 .",
    "the dephasing process is now described by an ensemble average over the fluctuations of @xmath83 .",
    "the physically intuitive reason for such a description is the necessity to repeat experiments many times to produce significant statistics for the efficient estimation of the populations .",
    "we make the following assumptions on the fluctuations of @xmath83 :    * the _ direction _",
    "@xmath97 of the magnetic field is constant , and the fluctuations only affect the field strength @xmath93 ; * the magnetic field may change from experimental run to the next , but within each run we assume the magnetic field to be constant .    both of these assumptions can be motivated at the hand of state - of - the - art experiments on cold atoms or trapped ions : the external field influences the energy splitting of the atomic two - level systems through a zeeman effect , as described above , and , thus , the field is chosen strong enough to dominate over the effect of possible stray fields .",
    "the field therefore has a fixed direction ( satisfying the first of the two above assumptions ) , but small fluctuations of the supplying currents will produce weak intensity fluctuations of @xmath93 , on top of a relatively large mean value .",
    "the mean value determines the time scale of the atomic evolution , which is therefore much faster than the time scale on which fluctuations occur ( satisfying the second assumption ) .    characterizing the intensity fluctuations with the probability distribution @xmath98",

    "in fact , as pointed out above , all states in the @xmath318 corner remain at a level of constant concurrence , even if they do not belong to the axis of time - invariant ( werner ) states .      in the present section",
    "we have studied the behavior of initially correlated quantum states under the influence of the collective dephasing evolution .",
    "to this end , we have extended the analysis of the correlation rank @xmath26 under collective dephasing to states of arbitrary initial correlation rank .",
    "furthermore , we have presented a convenient geometrical setting to describe bell - diagonal states and their evolution under collective dephasing .",
    "this geometrical interpretation allowed us to demonstrate that highly correlated ( @xmath146 ) initial states retain their strong correlations , as quantified by @xmath26 , under the collective dephasing dynamics for almost all choices of the magnetic field direction .    combining the a geometric description of the collective dephasing dynamics with a geometric interpretation of the concurrence ",
    "an entanglement measure  we have characterized a finite set of states showing time - invariant entanglement despite their incoherent evolution .      some features of bipartite states can be directly generalized to a multipartite setting . for example , the generalized werner states , i.e. , those states that are invariant under @xmath387-operations @xcite , are the fixed points of the collective dephasing map for any number of qubits @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the decay and the time - invariant preservation of multipartite entanglement properties was also provided . a compelling explanation for the mechanism that enables this phenomenon in a multipartite case is , however , presently unavailable . in the following we allude to two possible approaches towards achieving this goal .",
    "the conservation of @xmath326 in bipartite states of qubits can be related to the overlap between the state of the system @xmath95 and the singlet state @xmath388 @xcite .",
    "this is true for any state @xmath389 that is an eigenstate of the collective dephasing hamiltonian for an arbitrary choice of the magnetic field direction .",
    "these eigenstates are the multi - qubit singlet states @xcite , which exist only for an even number @xmath82 of qubits , and are a family of @xmath390 $ ] linearly independent states .",
    "the overlap with each of these states is an integral of motion , which in the bipartite case reduces to the conservation of entanglement for all magnetic field directions .",
    "it is however not clear whether the overlap with the _ multi_-qubit singlet states is related to entanglement , especially considering that we observe conserved entanglement properties for any  and not just for an even  number of qubits .",
    "another approach originates from the observation that the collective dephasing map describes a simultaneous rotation of all qubits , hence it has a set of fixed points , the rotation axis , and the ( hyper-)planes orthogonal to it are mapped onto ( a subset of ) themselves .",
    "the fixed points of the map are the werner states @xcite , and , in the tetrahedron of bell - diagonal states , the planes orthogonal to the rotation axis contain the states with the same amount of entanglement . in an analogous higher - dimensional picture , the set of states orthogonal to the family of multipartite werner states may lead to an interesting set of integrals of motion .",
    "to summarize , we provided a detailed analysis of the impact of a collective dephasing process on the correlation properties of bipartite states . based on the kraus representation of the dephasing process @xcite , we provided conditions that enable the generation of states with high correlation rank and non - vanishing quantum discord from uncorrelated or only weakly correlated states .    using an intuitive geometric representation of the state space and the collective dynamics",
    ", we investigated the entanglement dynamics under collective dephasing . for initially entangled states , we provided conditions that ensure the complete preservation of the entanglement for all times under the dephasing dynamics .",
    "surprisingly , this is possible even for large families of states that do not belong to time - invariant subspaces , i.e. , states that change in time due to the incoherent dynamics .",
    "while some of the results could be generalized straight - forwardly to multipartite scenarios , a compelling picture describing time - invariant multipartite entanglement remains to be conceived .",
    "since collective dephasing represents one of the dominant sources of error for many experiments with trapped atomic particles , we expect that the results derived in the present article can be readily harnessed in state - of - the - art setups with trapped ions @xcite or ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "_ note added._an experimental observation of time - invariant entanglement was reported in @xcite after completion of this manuscript .",
