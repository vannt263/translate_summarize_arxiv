    "this paper continues the development of the variational approach to multisymplectic field theory introduced in marsden , patrick , and shkoller @xcite . in that paper , only first - order field theories were considered .",
    "herein , we shall focus on second - order field theories , i.e. , those field theories governed by lagrangians that depend on the spacetime location , the field , and its first and second partial derivatives .",
    "multisymplectic geometry and its applications to covariant field theory and nonlinear partial differential equations ( pde ) has a rich and interesting history that we shall not discuss in this paper ; rather , we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the covariant multisymplectic approach is the field - theoretic generalization of the symplectic approach to classical mechanics .",
    "the configuration manifold @xmath2 of classical lagrangian mechanics is replaced by a fiber bundle @xmath3 over the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath7 , whose sections are the physical fields of interest ; the lagrangian phase space is @xmath8 in lagrangian mechanics , whereas for kth - order field theories , the role of phase space is played by the kth - jet bundle of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , thus reflecting the additional dependence of the fields on spatial variables .    for a given smooth lagrangian @xmath10",
    ", there is a distinguished symplectic @xmath11-form @xmath12 on @xmath8 , whose hamiltonian vector field is the solution of the euler - lagrange equations of lagrangian mechanics .",
    "lagrangian field theories , on the other hand , governed by covariant lagrangians @xmath13 , can be completely described by the multisymplectic @xmath4@xmath5@xmath11-form @xmath14 on @xmath15 , the field - theoretic analogue of the symplectic @xmath11-form @xmath12 of classical mechanics . in the case that @xmath7 is one dimensional , @xmath14 reduces to the usual time - dependent @xmath11-form of classical nonautonomous mechanics ( see @xcite ) .    traditionally , the symplectic @xmath11-form @xmath12 as well as the multisymplectic @xmath4@xmath5@xmath11-form @xmath14 are constructed on the lagrangian side , using the pull - back by the legendre transform of canonical differential forms on the dual or hamiltonian side .",
    "recently , however , marsden , patrick , and shkoller @xcite have shown that for first order field theories wherein @xmath16 , @xmath17 arises as the boundary term in the first variation of the action @xmath18 for smooth mappings @xmath19 .",
    "this method is advantageous to the traditional approach in that    * a complete geometric theory can be derived while staying entirely on the lagrangian side , and * multisymplectic structure can be obtained in non - standard settings such as discrete field theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper , is to generalize the results of @xcite to the case that @xmath20 . in section 2 ,",
    "we prove in theorem [ thm_main ] , that a unique multisymplectic @xmath4@xmath5@xmath11 form arises as the boundary term of the first variation of the action function .",
    "we then prove in theorem [ thm_mff ] , the multisymplectic form formula for second - order field theories , a covariant generalization of the fact that in conservative mechanics , the flow preserves the symplectic structure .",
    "we then obtain the covariant noether theorem for second - order field theories , by taking the first variation of the action function , restricted to the space of solutions of the covariant euler - lagrange equations .    in section 3",
    ", we use our abstract geometric theory on the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation , a model of shallow water waves that simultaneously exhibits solitary wave interaction and wave - breaking .",
    "we show that the multisymplectic form formula produces a new conservation law ideally suited to study wave instability , and connect our intrinsic theory with bridges theory of multisymplectic structures ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the discretization of second - order field theories .",
    "we are able to use our general theory to produce numerical algorithms for nonlinear pde that are governed by second - order lagrangians which naturally respect a discrete multisymplectic form formula and a discrete noether theorem .",
