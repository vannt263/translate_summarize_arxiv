    "neither venus nor mars has a strong global intrinsic magnetic field and therefore the solar wind is able to flow close to the planets in regions where the exospheric neutral density is high . because of the resulting direct interaction between the exosphere and the solar wind , ionized atmospheric neutrals are accelerated ( picked up ) by the solar wind electric field .",
    "charge exchange reactions between the solar wind protons and planetary neutrals also produce energetic neutral hydrogen atoms ( h - enas ) .",
    "observation of h - enas is thus a manifestation of the direct interaction between the solar wind plasma and planetary neutrals .",
    "picked - up planetary o@xmath0 ions can also form energetic neutral oxygen atoms ( o - ena ) via charge exchange process .",

    "the venus - solar wind interaction can be analysed self - consistently by three - dimensional ( 3-d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) and quasi - neutral hybrid ( qnh ) models .",
    "the mhd models ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) are computationally cheaper than the qnh models ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus allowing a better grid resolution .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2-d ) qnh models @xcite allow similar or even better resolution than 3-d mhd models , but then e.g. the 3-d draping of the magnetic field around the planet can not be efficiently studied .",
    "an advantage of a 3-d multi - ion species qnh model , as compared with the 3-d multifluid mhd model , is that it includes finite ion gyroradius effects .",
    "furthermore , different ion species are allowed to have different velocities and temperatures .",
    "even arbitrary non - maxwellian distributions functions are allowed .",
    "therefore , the qnh model makes it possible to increase our understanding of those plasma environments where the ion gyroradius is comparable to or larger than the planet size .    in this paper the venusian plasma environment is studied with a recently developed 3-d qnh model .",
    "the model is based on previous 3-d qnh models that have been used to study plasma and magnetic fields near mars @xcite , mercury @xcite , saturnian moon titan @xcite and the moon @xcite .",
    "the analysis focuses on the asymmetries caused by kinetic effects , the role of the imf ( interplanetary magnetic field ) @xmath1-component and the properties of the escaping planetary o@xmath0 ions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
