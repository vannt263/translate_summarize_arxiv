    "emission features arising from transitions in are routinely detected in solar extreme ultraviolet spectra ( see , for example , dere 1978 ; thomas & neupert 1994 )",
    ". the diagnostic potential of these lines for determining the electron density in the emitting plasma was first demonstrated by kastner & mason ( 1978 ) . since then , several authors have produced theoretical line ratios for applicable to solar spectra ( see bhatia , doschek , & eissner 2002 and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we present theoretical line ratios for a range of electron temperatures and densities , generated using the most recent calculations of radiative rates and r - matrix electron impact excitation cross sections .",
    "we subsequently compare these line ratios with active region observations obtained with the _ solar euv research telescope and spectrograph _ ( serts ) sounding rocket experiment .",
    "specifically , we employ the serts dataset obtained during the 1995 flight , when the instrument incorporated a multilayer - coated toroidal diffraction grating that enhanced its sensitivity for features in the @xmath3170225   wavelength range , observed in second - order between 340 and 450  .",
    "this led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous serts flights ( thomas & neupert 1994 ; brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) , and provided the highest spectral resolution ( 0.03  ) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this wavelength range ( brosius , davila , & thomas 1998 ) .",
    "hence this serts dataset allows us to undertake the most comprehensive analysis to date of the solar spectrum in the 170225   wavelength region .",
    "the solar spectrum analysed in the present paper is that of active region noaa 7870 , recorded on eastman kodak 10107 emulsion by serts during a rocket flight on 1995 may 15 at 1800 ut ( brosius et al .",
    "serts first flew in 1989 ( neupert et al .",
    "1992 ; thomas & neupert 1994 ) , and carried a standard gold - coated toroidal diffraction grating .",
    "it observed hundreds of first - order emission lines in the 235450   wavelength range , as well as dozens of features spanning 170225  , which appeared in second - order between 340 and 450  .",
    "the version of serts flown in 1991 and 1993 ( brosius et al .",
    "1996 ) carried a multilayer - coated diffraction grating that enhanced the instrumental efficiency in the first - order wavelength range .",
    "however , as noted in   1 , the version flown in 1995 incorporated a multilayer grating that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity for second - order features .",
    "the serts 1995 active region spectrum therefore provides the best observations for investigating solar emission lines in the 170225 wavelength region .",
    "further details of the observations , and the wavelength and absolute flux calibration procedures employed in the data reduction , may be found in brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we have searched for emission lines in the serts spectrum , using the identifications of jupn , isler , & trbert ( 1993 ) and the nist database , as well as previous solar detections where available ( for example , those by behring , cohen , & feldman 1972 ; behring et al .",
    "in table 1 we list the transitions found in the spectrum , along with the measured wavelengths .",
    "we also note possible blending species or alternative identifications , as suggested by brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their original line list for the active region spectrum ,    intensities and line widths ( fwhm ) of the features are given in table 2 , along with the associated 1@xmath8 errors .",
    "these were determined by using the spectrum synthesis package dipso ( howarth , murray , & mills 1994 ) to fit gaussian profiles to the observations .",
    "uncertainties in these measurements have been determined using methods discussed in detail by thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) . in figures",
    "14 we plot portions of the serts spectrum containing the features , to show the quality of the observational data .",
    "we note that each serts spectrum exhibits a background level due to film fog , scattered light and actual solar continuum . the background was calculated using methods detailed in thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) and brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and then subtracted from the initial spectrum , leaving only an emission line spectrum ( with noise ) on a zero base level .",
    "it is this zero base level which is shown in figures 14 .",
    "we note that some of the measured emission lines , such as the 184.80   transition ( figure 1 ) , have line intensities comparable to the noise fluctuations . in these instances",

    "these a - values are similar to those of deb & tayal ( 1998 ) and bhatia & doschek ( 1996 ) , apart from transitions involving levels 39 ( 3_s_@xmath03_p_@xmath2(@xmath0d)3_d _ @xmath2p@xmath12 ) and 41 ( 3_s_@xmath03_p_@xmath2(@xmath0d)3_d _ @xmath9p@xmath12 ) , where there are large discrepancies .",
    "it appears that these levels have been interchanged in the previous two calculations , as agreement is restored if aggarwal & keenan ( 2003a ) reclassify the a - values relating to level 39 as belonging to level 41 , and vice - versa .",
    "however we note that aggarwal & keenan ( 2003a ) performed several test calculations , involving configuration interaction with different orbitals and configurations , and in each instance obtained the same energy level ordering .",
    "they are hence confident of the ordering of the levels of their calculations .",
    "radiative rates for forbidden transitions have also been taken from the work of aggarwal & keenan ( 2003a ) , although the data were not included in the published paper for conciseness .",

    "the transitions corresponding to the wavelengths listed above are given in table 1 .",
    "given errors in the adopted atomic data of typically @xmath2310%  ( see the references above ) , we would expect the theoretical ratios to be accurate to better than @xmath2320% .",
    "the ratios in figures 59 are given relative to the 188.21 transition , as this feature is the cleanest and most reliably detected emission line in the serts spectrum ( see figures 14 ) .",
    "we have confirmed this via a search of line lists , such as the atomic line list of van hoofpvh/ ] , and also by generating a synthetic active region spectrum using the latest version ( 4.2 ) of the chianti database ( dere et al .",
    "1997 ; young et al . 2003 ) .",
    "no transitions in first or second - order with intensities @xmath31 3%  that of the 188.21 line were found . however , we note that theoretical results involving any line pair are available from one of the authors ( f.keenan@qub.ac.uk ) on request .",
    "an inspection of the figures reveals that several of the line ratios , in particular r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 , are very sensitive to variations in the electron density .",
    "however most of the ratios are relatively insensitive to the adopted electron temperature .",
    "the strong n@xmath4dependence of ratios such as r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 , combined with their temperature insensitivity , make them potentially useful density diagnostics for the emitting region of a plasma .",
    "we note that the current line ratios can differ by up to typically 2030%  with other recent calculations .",
    "for example , at t@xmath4 = 10@xmath22 k and n@xmath4 = 10@xmath32 @xmath7 , we calculate r@xmath12 = 1.8 and r@xmath14 = 0.18 , compared to r@xmath12 = 2.2 and r@xmath14 = 0.26 from the latest version of chianti . these discrepancies are due primarily to the adoption of the aggarwal & keenan ( 2003b ) excitation rates in the present analysis , as opposed to the results of bhatia & doschek ( 1996 ) and gupta & tayal ( 1999a , b ) adopted by previous authors ( see aggarwal & keenan 2003b for more details ) .",
    "in table 3 we summarise the observed emission line intensity ratios , along with the associated 1@xmath8 errors .",

    "1998 ) , and an electron density of n@xmath4 = 10@xmath33 @xmath7 .",
    "this density was derived for the serts active region from emission line ratios in , and ( brosius et al .",
    "1998 ) , which have similar values of t@xmath21 to ( 10@xmath1110@xmath34 k ) .",
    "hence the , and densities should reflect that of the emitting plasma in the active region .",
    "we note that line ratios in the active region imply significantly higher values of density ( n@xmath4 @xmath35 10@xmath36 @xmath7 ) , but these have not been adopted in the present work as they are inconsistent with the other fe ions , and may indicate a problem with the diagnostics .",
    "however , changing the theoretical line ratios in table 3 to values for n@xmath4 @xmath35 10@xmath36 @xmath7 would not significantly alter the discussion below .",
    "for r@xmath30 , which is predicted to be n@xmath4insensitive , the theoretical result in table 3 is the value listed in   3 .",
    "error bars for all the theoretical ratios are based on the estimated @xmath2320%  accuracy of the calculations ( see   3 ) .",
    "an inspection of table 3 reveals excellent agreement between theory and observation for the r@xmath15 and r@xmath30 ratios , indicating that the 184.80 and 192.81   lines are well detected and free from blends .",
    "more importantly , these results imply that r@xmath15 may be employed with confidence as an n@xmath4diagnostic",
    ". it should be particularly useful over the n@xmath4 = 10@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath7 interval , where it varies by a factor of 11.7 and yet shows little temperature sensitivity ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "for the ratios r@xmath13 , r@xmath14 and r@xmath25 , agreement between theory and observation is less satisfactory , but the calculated and experimental measurements do overlap within the uncertainties . hence we can state that the 181.13 , 182.17 and 189.72   emission lines appear to be free from blends , especially as an inspection of line lists and the synthetic active region spectrum from chianti reveals no likely candidates in first or second - order . from figure 6 , the r@xmath14 ratio should provide a reasonably good n@xmath4diagnostic , varying by a factor of 2.5 between n@xmath4 = 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "however on the basis of the present analysis it is advised that more weight should be given to results from r@xmath15 .    in the cases of r@xmath12 and r@xmath27 , the measured line ratios are much larger than the theoretical values , confirming that the 180.38 and 193.51 lines are badly blended .",

    "hence we believe that the 188.30   feature is due to the @xmath2p@xmath13@xmath2s@xmath12 transition , as classified by jupn et al . ,",
    "although the disagreement between theory and observation for r@xmath16 implies that the line is blended , as previously noted by brosius et al .",
    "there are no obvious blending species , although brosius et al .",
    "point out that kelly ( 1987 ) lists an si line from an undetermined ionization stage at 188.3  .",
    "also , dere ( 1978 ) lists a line at 376.61    which would be the second - order detection of a feature at 188.31  .",
    "however thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) identify this as a transition , which is very weak in the 1989 serts active region dataset , and hence is unlikely to be responsible for the blend .",
    "this is confirmed by the chianti synthetic spectrum , which indicates that the line should have an intensity @xmath37 10@xmath38 that of the 360.76   feature , observed by serts at 180.38 with i = 3440 erg @xmath39 s@xmath40 sr@xmath40 .",
    "hence the predicted intensity of the transition is @xmath37 0.01%  that of the 188.30   feature in table 2 .",
    "brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have tentatively associated the 189.19   line in the serts active region spectrum as being due to , although the wavelength of the feature is higher than previously measured ( 189.13  ) .",
    "kelly ( 1987 ) lists an line at 189.16   and a transition at 189.21  .",
    "however , a comparison of the observed and theoretical r@xmath18 ratios from table 3 indicates that blending is probably not responsible for any wavelength discrepancy , as the measured ratio is actually smaller than the calculated value .",
    "the serts wavelength measurement should be accurate to @xmath230.01   or better ( see figure 3 and brosius et al . ) , and as noted in   2 this is the highest resolution solar active region spectrum obtained over the 170225   wavelength region .",
    "hence we are confident of the wavelength measurement for the line , and the discrepancy may be due to inaccuracies in previous determinations from lower quality data .",
    "the good agreement between theory and observation for r@xmath17 confirms that the 189.00   feature , previously unidentified in the serts spectrum , is due to . to our knowledge , this is the first time this transition has been identified in the solar spectrum .",
    "similarly , our results for r@xmath26 indicate that the 192.88   feature must have a significant contribution from , and is not totally due to as suggested by brosius et al .",
    "the observed r@xmath26 ratio is somewhat larger than theory ( although they agree within the error bars ) , so that may make a 3050%contribution to the line blend . once again , to our knowledge this is the first time this line has been identified in the solar spectrum .",
    "brosius et al .",
    "( 1998 ) list the 223.00   line as a blend of and .",
    "however our calculations for r@xmath20 show that the contribution is negligible , while the intensity of the 223.00   transition is predicted to be less than 1%  that of the 192.88   line ( dufton et al .",
    "1983 ) , ruling out a identification .",
    "a more likely candidate for the 223.00   feature is the 2_s _ @xmath0s@xmath412_p _ @xmath0p@xmath42 resonance line of , suggested by both dere ( 1978 ) and dufton et al .",
    "support for this comes from the chianti synthetic spectrum , which predicts the 2_s _ @xmath0s@xmath412_p _ @xmath0p@xmath41 line of at 279.74   and an intensity ratio i(279.74 )/i(223.00  ) = 0.42 .",
    "there is indeed an unidentified feature in the serts spectrum at this wavelength , with i(279.74 )/i(223.00  ) = 0.55 @xmath230.21 .",
    "the presence of two features at the predicted wavelengths of the lines and with the correct intensity ratio may be a coincidence , but this must be considered unlikely . hence we believe that the 223.00 and 279.74   features are the two components of the doublet .",
    "furthermore , the detection of the resonance lines of a highly ionized species such as in the serts spectrum implies that probably does make a significant contribution to the 192.88   feature ( see above ) , as the transition is also a strong resonance line , and the solar abundance of ca is larger than that for cr .",
