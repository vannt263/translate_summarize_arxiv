    "a subset of galaxies are active , indicating that the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) is accreting material . within such active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , this accretion disk is in turn surrounded by an obscuring medium of dust and gas , thought to have a toroidal geometry ( e.g. antonucci 1993 , urry & padovani 1995 ) . in type",
    "1 agn , the system is oriented such that the line of sight intercepts the opening of this `` torus , '' exposing the accretion disk and broad load region ( blr ) .",
    "conversely , this central region is blocked in type 2 agn , as the system is inclined such that the line of sight is through the obscuring medium . in these obscured agns , the narrow line region ( nlr ) is visible as well as scattered and reflected emission from the central engine .",
    "previous studies have shown that obscured agn constitute at least half of the local population ( risaliti 1999 , bassani 1999 , guainazzi et al .",
    "obscuration can result from the putative torus or even the host galaxy where dust from nuclear star formation processes ( e.g. ballantyne 2008 ) , extranuclear dust ( rigby et al .",
    "2006 ) or dilution of agn emission by the galaxy ( trump et al .",
    "2009 ) can attenuate optical signatures of agn activity .",
    "however , in this study we focus on `` toroidal '' obscured sources ( where the absorption is intrinsic to the agn , on the scale of a few parsecs , enshrouding the blr ) since a substantial fraction of heavily obscured , compton - thick ( column density n@xmath5 1.5@xmath6 @xmath3 ) agn are often invoked to explain the unresolved portions of the x - ray background at 30 kev ( e.g. gilli et al . 2007 ) .",
    "an accurate census of these agn is necessary to constrain x - ray background synthesis models ( e.g. treister et al .",
    "2009 ) and studying their properties are crucial in understanding the full agn population .",
    "unfortunately , such obscured agn are missed in 2 - 10 kev x - ray surveys as absorption and compton - scattering severely attenuate this x - ray emission .",
    "selecting agn samples based on intrinsic agn flux proxies ( f@xmath7 ) , which are ideally unaffected by the amount of toroidal obscuration present , is therefore necessary to uncover compton - thick agn .",
    "such diagnostics include emission lines which are primarily ionized by accretion disk photons and are formed in the nlr , making them not subject to torus obscuration , and include the optical [ oiii ] 5007  line ( e.g. heckman et al . 2005 ) and the infrared [ oiv ] 25.89 @xmath0 m line ( e.g. melndez et al .",
    "2008 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 , rigby et al 2009 ) .",
    "the obscuring medium absorbs continuum photons and re - radiates them in the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "this emission constitutes approximately 20% of the bolometric luminosity in most type 1 and type 2 agn @xcite , making it another isotropic indicator of intrinsic agn flux .",
    "follow - up x - ray observations can then reveal which sources are potentially compton - thick .",
    "several studies have used infrared emission to locate such obscured agn ( daddi et al .",
    "2007 , fiore et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these studies have selected sources with infrared emission in excess of that attributable to star formation , indicating the presence of an agn . using either _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton _ spectra ( fiore et al .",
    "2009 ) or stacked x - ray spectra for non - detections ( daddi et al .",
    "2007 , fiore et al . 2009 ) , the column densities of these sources were estimated to constrain the compton - thick fraction . however , these studies focus on high redshift sources ( @xmath8 = 0.7 - 2.5 ) , rely on assumptions of the source spectrum shape ( to convert count rate to flux for detections or hardness ratio to flux for stacked spectra ) and in the case of stacked sources , only characterize the aggregate population rather than individual sources",
    ". these analyses are useful in estimating a potential compton - thick fraction at early times in the universe , but local sources generally have the advantage of x - ray spectra with higher signal - to - noise , where each source can be individually analyzed and the spectra better characterized to more robustly constrain obscuration diagnostics .",
    "we have undertaken such an analysis on two homogeneous samples of local ( @xmath9 0.15 ) seyfert 2 galaxies ( sy2s ) selected based on intrinsic flux proxies : a mir sample from the original _ iras _",
    "12@xmath0 m survey @xcite and an [ oiii]-selected sample culled from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton _ spectra of these sources were fit in a homogeneous and systematic manner . however , column densities derived from spectral fitting in the 2 - 10 kev band are highly model dependent and thus may not always reflect the intrinsic toroidal absorption .",
    "other proxies are therefore necessary to identify potentially compton - thick sources . as the 2 - 10 kev x - ray emission",
    "is suppressed in absorbed sources , the ratio of this emission to intrinsic flux indicators can probe the amount of obscuration . in compton - thick sources ,",
    "the ratio of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux ( f@xmath10 ) to f@xmath7 is about an order of magnitude or lower than what is observed in unobscured sources ( e.g. bassani et al .",
    "1999 , cappi et al .",
    "2006 , panessa et al .",
    "2006 , melndez et al .",
    "x - ray spectral signatures , most notably the equivalent width ( ew ) of the neutral fe k@xmath4 line at 6.4 kev , can also aid in uncovering heavily obscured sources . as the ew is measured against a suppressed continuum , it rises with increasing column density , reaching values of several hundred ev to over 1 kev in compton - thick sources ( e.g. levenson et al .",
    "similar to lamassa et al .",
    "2009 , we use f@xmath10/f@xmath7 and the fe k@xmath4 ew as obscuration diagnostics in this work .    this paper is organized as follows : we describe the sample selection in section 2 and the spectral fitting procedures in section 3 .",
    "we then estimate the potential compton - thick population using ancillary optical and ir data and discuss the various possible absorber geometries revealed by our obscuration diagnostics . utilizing ir data to parametrize host galaxy characteristics , namely star formation processes , and agn activity , such as intrinsic agn luminosity , central black hole mass and eddington ratio , we investigate whether compton - thick sources trace a unique population",
    ". we also comment on the feasibility of detecting these sources in an upcoming hard x - ray ( 5 - 80 kev ) mission , nustar .",
    "our combined sample consists of 28 mir selected and 17 [ oiii ] selected sy2s .",
    "the mir sample is a subset of the 31 sy2s from the original _ iras _",
    "12@xmath0 m survey @xcite , which was drawn from the _ iras _ point source catalog ( version 2 ) .",
    "the sy2s in the 12@xmath0 m sample were selected via a weak color cut ( i.e. 12@xmath0 m flux less than the 60 or 100 @xmath0 m flux ) and is complete to a flux - density limit of 0.3 jy at 12@xmath0 m , with latitude @xmath11 which avoids galactic contamination @xcite .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data exist for 28 of these 31 sources .",
    "the [ oiii]-selected sy2s were culled from the main galaxy sample ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 @xcite . using the sdss spectra ,",
    "sy2s were identified using the the diagnostic line ratio plot of [ oiii]/h@xmath12 and [ nii]/h@xmath4 ( bpt diagram , baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ) and the kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) demarcations which distinguish sy2s , composite systems and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the 20 local ( @xmath9 0.15 ) sy2s with [ oiii ] 5007@xmath13 flux @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 @xmath3 that lie within the agn locus of the bpt diagram were selected to comprise this sample . of these 20 sy2s , 2 had archival _ xmm - newton _ observations and",
    "we were awarded _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    "time for another 15 sources .",
    "the x - ray analysis for these 17 [ oiii ] selected sy2s was presented in lamassa et al .",
    "2009 and is not replicated here ; we utilize the results of that study ( 2 - 10 kev x - ray fluxes , fe k@xmath4 ews , etc . ) in this work .",
    "though both original samples are complete , since x - ray data only exists for 28/31 and 17/20 sources from the 12@xmath0 m and [ oiii ] samples respectively , our resultant sample for x - ray analysis is nearly complete .",
    "we note that this study has the advantage of analyzing samples of sy2s selected via two different techniques which can mitigate biases from any individual selection criterion .",
    "for instance , dusty host galaxies can attenuate the optical emission lines used to identify agn ( and thus potentially miss galaxy obscured agn ) , whereas mir selection can isolate such sources .",
    "star formation processes in the host galaxy can also enhance mir , limiting its usefulness as an intrinsic indicator of pure agn flux . however , such effects are minimal in this study as all but two mir identified sy2s live in the agn locus of the bpt diagram and those two sources inhabit the composite ( agn and star - forming ) locus and would not be optically identified as pure star - forming galaxies",
    ". we also note that many low - luminosity agns and some quasars lack the ir signature of a torus ( ho 2008 , hao et al .",
    "2010 , respectively ) , and thus mir selection is not a useful tool for investigating such agns or their obscured counterparts .",
    "we explore the issues of selection effect biases further in section 4.2 .",
    "we analyzed the available archival _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations for the 12@xmath0 m sources with xassist @xcite . this program runs the appropriate science analysis systems ( sas ) tasks to filter the data and clean for flaring as well as extract spectra and associated response files for user - defined sources . table [ log ] lists the x - ray observations used in this analysis , including the obsids and net exposure times after filtering .",
    "twenty - five out of 28 sources were detected at the 3@xmath16 level or greater in the 0.5 - 10 kev band .",
    "one ( ngc5193 ) was detected in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and we were thus able to fit this part of the spectrum .",
    "we obtained upper 2 - 10 kev flux limits on this source and the two undetected sources ( f08572 + 3915 and ngc 7590 ) , discussed in detail below .",
    "we used simple absorbed power law models to fit the spectra for the detected sources , which may not accurately represent the complex geometry of these systems .",
    "however , our main goal is to apply a systematic and homogeneous analysis of the spectra in a similar manner as @xcite to derive an observed x - ray flux , and where possible , ew of the fe k@xmath4 line .",
    "more extensive x - ray modeling of several sources have been investigated in detail in the literature ( e.g. see brightman & nandra 2010 for more detailed x - ray modeling of the extended 12@xmath0 m sample ) and we do not intend to replicate previously published work . in appendix",
    "a , we discuss individual sources , compare our derived parameters with those quoted in the literature and comment on the impact more complex models have on such parameters .",
    "we find that in 18/23 sources , we recover consistent ( within 1@xmath16 ) observed x - ray fluxes and fe k@xmath4 ew values as more complex models .",
    "this work also represents the first analysis for a handful of datasets ( i.e. _ chandra _ spectrum of ic 5063 , _ xmm - newton _ 2004 epic spectra of ngc 7172 and _ xmm - newton _ epic spectra of ngc 7674 ) .",
    "multiple observations for each source , as well as the spectra from the three _ xmm - newton _ detectors ( pn , mos1 and mos2 ) , were fit simultaneously with a constant multiplicative factor which was allowed to vary by @xmath1720% to account for calibration differences among detectors / observations .",
    "the remaining model parameters were initially tied together , with the residuals inspected to check for inconsistencies among observations .",
    "differences among _ xmm - newton _ observations are interpreted as source variability , and were present in 4/28 sources ( ngc 4388 , ngc 5506 , ngc 7172 and ngc 7582 ) .",
    "nine sy2s had both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ archival data , with 8/9 having flux and/or spectral discrepancies between observations ; only ngc 424 had consistent _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data . as _",
    "chandra _ has higher spatial resolution than _ xmm - newton _ , it better isolates the central agn .",
    "differences in the spectra between the two observatories could thus be due to source variability , or extended emission from the host galaxy ( e.g. x - ray binaries , thermal emission from hot gas , etc . )",
    "that _ xmm - newton _ can not resolve from the agn emission . to test",
    "if such differences were due to variability or contamination , we extracted the _",
    "chandra _ source region to have the same size as the _ xmm - newton _ region , @xmath1720 . ",
    "if the best fit parameters and flux were consistent between the two datasets with the matched aperture extraction areas , we concluded that extended emission is likely contaminating the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "if a discrepancy still existed , we interpreted this as source variability between observations .",
    "five sources showed evidence of contamination from extended emission within the _ xmm - newton _ aperture , i.e. matched aperture extraction between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations resulted in consistent model parameters and flux : ngc 1386 , f05189 - 2524 , ngc 3982 , ngc 4501 and mrk 463 . for 3 of these sources ( ngc 1386 ,",
    "f05189 - 2524 and mrk 463 ) , the best - fit parameters with the default _ chandra _ extraction region were consistent with the _ xmm - newton _ spectra , with the exception of the constant multiplicative factor which was lower in the _ chandra _ observations ( @xmath18% of _ xmm - newton _ ) .",
    "we therefore fit the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra simultaneously to constrain the _ chandra _ parameters .",
    "however , we report the flux from the _ chandra _ observations only in table [ flux ] , as this isolates the central agn .",
    "the spectra from the default _ chandra _ extraction areas for the other two sources ( ngc 3982 and ngc 4501 ) did not have consistent model parameters with the _ xmm - newton _ spectra , likely due to x - ray binaries in the host galaxy affecting the spectral shape in the _ xmm - newton _ data , so we therefore fit the _ chandra _ spectra from the default extraction area independently and report these parameters in table [ apec ] .",
    "three sy2s were variable between the two observatories : ngc 4388 , arp 220 and ngc 7582 .",
    "arp 220 was fit simultaneously between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations with only the absorption component fit independently for the _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "ngc 4388 and ngc 7582 exhibited spectral variation between the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations and were therefore fit independently .",
    "we list the best fit parameters for the default _ chandra _ extraction spectra and the _ xmm - newton _ spectra separately in table [ apec ] for these two sources .",
    "we initially fit all spectra with an absorbed power law model .",
    "most spectra ( 18/26 ) had an adequate number of detected photons to be grouped by a minimum of 15 counts per bin without loss of spectral information and were thus analyzed with @xmath19 ; the remaining 8 ( ngc 3982 , ngc 4501 , tololo 1238 - 364 , ngc 4968 , ngc 5135 , ngc 5953 , ngc 6890 and ngc 7130 ) were analyzed with the cash statistic ( c - stat , cash 1979 ) and binned by 2 - 3 counts as xspec handles slightly binned spectra better than unbinned when using c - stat @xcite . with the exception of 7 sources ( ngc 1667 , ngc 3982 , ngc 4501 , tololo 1238 - 364 , ngc 4968 , ngc 5953 and arp 220 )",
    ", a second power law component was needed to accommodate the data ( i.e. _ phabs@xmath20*(pow@xmath20 + phabs@xmath21*pow@xmath21 ) _ ) .",
    "the two power law indices ( @xmath22 ) were tied together and the normalizations and absorption components were fit independently .",
    "such a model represents a partial covering geometry with the first power law denoting the soft scattered and/or reflected agn continuum and the second component describing the absorbed transmitted emission .",
    "residuals below 2 kev were present in many of the sources , suggesting emission in excess of the scattered agn continuum .",
    "this excess is likely due to thermal emission from hot gas related to star formation processes , and consistent with @xcite , we used a thermal model ( apec in xspec ) with abundances fixed at solar to fit this emission . according to the f - test , addition of this component improved the fit at greater than the 3@xmath16 level over the best - fit single or double power law model for 16/25 sources . in table",
    "[ apec ] , we present the best - fit parameters from the apec plus power law models , along with the @xmath19 values from the single absorbed power law fit , and where applicable , the double absorbed power law fit .",
    "we required a lower limit on the first absorption component ( @xmath23 ) to be equal to the galactic absorption . in some cases , the best - fit absorption was equal to the galactic @xmath24 and we subsequently froze @xmath23 to the galactic value for these sources .",
    "we were only able to obtain an upper limit on @xmath23 for three sources ( mrk 463 , ngc 6890 and ngc 7130 ) , as the lower error bound pegged at the galactic absorption ; the upper 90% limit is thus listed in table [ apec ] .",
    "we also quote the 90% upper limit on kt for the six cases where the lower error on the temperature pegged at the limit of 0.1 kev ( f05189 - 2524 , ngc 3982 , the _ chandra _ observation of ngc 4388 , ngc 4968 , ngc 5347 and the _ chandra _ observation of ngc 7582 ) .",
    "we included gaussian components to accommodate the fe k@xmath4 emission when present ( see below ) and additional gaussian components for other emission features in ngc 1068 and ngc 7582 ( see appendix a ) . in table",
    "[ pow ] , we list the best - fit parameters for the absorbed single / double power law fit for ngc 5953 and the 9 sources which according to the f - test , are not statistically significantly improved ( @xmath25 3@xmath16 ) by adding the apec component and are therefore better described by the simpler single / double power law model ( ngc 424 , the _ chandra _ observation of ngc 4388 , ngc 4968 , ngc 5135 , ngc 5347 , ngc 6890 , ic 5063 , the _ chandra _ observation of ngc 7582 and ngc 7674 ) .",
    "we list the observed 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux from these best - fit models in table [ flux ] . for the cases where addition of the apec model improved the fit , we excluded this component when deriving the x - ray flux .",
    "the flux was averaged among multiple observations when these observations were consistent . for variable sources",
    ", the flux is listed independently for each observation . for arp 220 ,",
    "only the absorption varied between the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations , which had a negligible impact on the flux .",
    "we therefore averaged the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ fluxes for this source .",
    "we note that ngc 7582 has a higher observed _ chandra _ flux , compared to the _ xmm - newton _ fluxes , despite the smaller _ chandra _ spectral extraction area ; aperture effects could contribute to the lower _ chandra _ flux ( compared with _",
    "xmm - newton _ ) for ngc 4388 .    in figure [ spectra ]",
    ", we plot the spectra with the best - fit models . as many sources have multiple observations , we plot only one spectrum per observation , generally using the pn spectrum for _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations unless the mos spectrum had better signal - to - noise .",
    "though we report the flux of the _ chandra _ observations only for ngc 1386 , f05189 - 2524 and mrk 463 , we plot both the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ spectra to illustrate how the _ xmm - newton _ spectra helped to constrain the fit .",
    "bright x - ray sources can be susceptible to pileup which occurs when a ccd records two or more photons as a single event during the frame integration time . to test",
    "if this phenomenon affected our bright sources , we examined the pattern and observed distribution plots from the sas task _ epatplot _ for _ xmm - newton _ observations and the output of pimms for _ chandra _ observations . in a handful of _ xmm - newton _ observations ( i.e. ngc 1068 , ngc 5506 and ngc 7172 ) , one to two of the detectors exhibited evidence of pileup , but at least one of the detectors did not .",
    "the `` piled '' spectra were therefore disregarded from the fit without loss of information as we obtained one to two non - piled spectra per observation ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "as pimms uses simple models to test for the presence of pileup ( e.g. single absorbed power laws whereas most of our sources needed a second power law component ) , we fit the _ chandra _ spectra with evidence of pileup ( i.e. ic 5063 and ngc 7582 ) in _ sherpa _ , using the jdpileup model and best - fit continuum model ( with a gaussian at the fe k@xmath4 energy if necessary ) , to better constrain the pileup percentage .",
    "however , we utilized the pileup model in xspec ( with @xmath4 , the `` grade migration '' parameter , as the only free parameter ) along with the best - fit models to derive the 2 - 10 kev flux and fe k@xmath4 ew , where the pileup component was removed before calculating these quantities .",
    "we note that the _ sherpa _ and xspec fits using their respective pileup models give consistent best - fit parameters and observed fluxes .",
    "three sources were not detected within the 2 - 10 kev range : f08572 + 3915 , ngc 5953 and ngc 7590 .",
    "ngc 5953 was detected in the soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and was therefore fit with an absorbed power law model .",
    "it was necessary to freeze the absorption to properly model the photon index .",
    "as the soft component generally results from scattered / reflected agn emission , the absorption attenuating this component results from obscuration along the line of sight rather than intrinsic toroidal absorption . in many cases in this study ,",
    "such absorption is on the order of galactic @xmath24 or marginally higher , so we froze @xmath24 to the galactic value . from this fit in the soft band",
    ", we extrapolated an upper limit on the 2 - 10 kev flux .",
    "f08572 + 3915 and ngc 7590 were not detected over the background in their @xmath1715 ks _ chandra _ and @xmath1710 ks _ xmm - newton _ observations , respectively .",
    "we therefore used a bayesian approach to estimate an upper limit on the flux based on the total number of counts within the spectral extraction region and an assumed spectral shape for the agn .",
    "we used a region size of @xmath172  for f08572 + 3915 and @xmath177.5  for ngc 7590 ( though _ xmm - newton _ has lower resolution and the extraction region is generally @xmath1720  , we constrained this region to a smaller size to exclude contamination from a nearby ultraluminous x - ray source @xcite ) . for ngc 7590 , we coadded the mos spectra together using the ftool _",
    "addspec_. we used the total detected and background counts from these spectra to calculate a one - sided 3@xmath16 ( i.e. 99.9% confidence level ) upper limit on the number of source counts .",
    "we then obtained an upper limit on the count rate by dividing this source count by the exposure time of the observation . using an absorbed power law model , which included galactic absorption , compton - thick absorption ( @xmath26 @xmath3 , which is a conservative estimate as neither source",
    "was detected in x - rays ) at the redshift of the source and a photon index of 1.8 , we calculated the 2 - 10 kev flux that corresponds to the 3@xmath16 upper limit on the count rate .",
    "these upper limits are listed in table [ flux ] .",
    "we note that applying this method to ngc 5953 results in a higher x - ray flux upper limit than extrapolating the spectral fit of the soft emission to higher energies , @xmath27 erg s@xmath15 @xmath3 vs @xmath28 erg s@xmath15 @xmath3 .",
    "we choose the latter value since this is based on the spectral information we have for this source .",
    "we used a gaussian component to model the neutral fe k@xmath4 emission .",
    "in many cases , this feature was evident when fitting the 0.5 - 8 kev spectrum and was included in the models mentioned above .",
    "for the sources where this line was not visible , we tested for its presence using the zgauss model , freezing the energy at 6.4 kev and the width at 0.01 kev and inputting the galaxy s redshift . from this fit , we can derive either a detection or upper limit on the neutral fe k@xmath4 flux and possibly ew .",
    "for the sources that had both _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations and had evidence of extended emission in the _ xmm - newton _ field of view ( i.e. ngc 1386 , f05189 - 2524 , ngc 3982 , ngc 4501 and mrk 463 ) , we used only the _ chandra _ spectrum to model the fe k@xmath4 emission to isolate the agn contribution .    to better constrain the ew of the neutral fe k@xmath4 line , we also fit the local continuum , from 3 - 4 kev to 8 kev , with a power law or double absorbed power law with an absorption component attenuating the second power law ( when the spectral shape required this extra model ) .",
    "we then added a gaussian or zgauss component to this local continuum fit .",
    "the results of the global and local continuum fits to the neutral fe k@xmath4line are listed in table [ kalpha ] . in some cases ( e.g. ngc 424 ,",
    "ngc 1386 ) , the local fit better constrains the underlying continuum and therefore leads to a more reliable value for the ew .",
    "we use the ews from the local fits in the subsequent analysis .",
    "similar to lamassa et al .",
    "2009 , we tested the significance of the fe k@xmath4 ew detections by running simulations based on the power law(s ) only component(s ) of the local fit .",
    "we fit these simulated spectra with a gaussian ( or zgauss ) component to estimate the null hypothesis distribution of line normalizations .",
    "then the percentage of times that the observed line normalization exceeded the simulated line normalizations gives the statistical significance of the line .",
    "with the observed x - ray flux and fe k@xmath4 ew constrained , we can determine the distribution of the amount of 2 - 10 kev attenuation associated with the obscuring torus .",
    "as both the 12@xmath0 m and [ oiii ] sample were selected on intrinsic agn properties , such a percentage might represent an unbiased estimate for the global agn population .",
    "similar to @xcite , we also explore if the fitted column densities agree with the proxies we use for agn obscuration : if the emission is seen primarily via scattering and/or reflection , do the fitted n@xmath29 values recover the intrinsic absorption ? the obscuration flux diagnostics and fe k@xmath4 ews also provide clues as to the obscuration geometry in these sources .",
    "we compare host galaxy and agn properties with compton - thick diagnostics to determine if sources with heavy absorption trace a unique populations from their less obscured counterparts . finally , as higher energy ( @xmath3010 kev ) observations are necessary to confirm a source as compton - thick , we comment on the detectability of these sy2s by nustar , an upcoming hard x - ray mission .",
    "as fitted column densities are model dependent and could be unreliable , we use other proxies to investigate the amount of toroidal absorption in these systems , including the ratio of the observed x - ray flux to the inherent agn flux .",
    "we consider three diagnostics for intrinsic agn power ( f@xmath7 ) : the [ oiii]@xmath1 5007  line , the [ oiv]25.89 @xmath0 m line and the mid - infrared ( mir ) continuum . the [ oiii ] and [ oiv ] lines are primarily ionized by the central engine , and as they form in the narrow line region , are not subject to torus obscuration . the mir emission results from the reprocessing of the agn continuum by the dusty obscuring medium .",
    "we use the flux at 13.5@xmath0 m , averaged over a 3@xmath0 m window , as f@xmath31 since this region is free from strong emission lines and absorption features . these fluxes are published in @xcite and @xcite and are not replicated here . as these proxies are to first - order unaffected by the obscuring medium , whereas the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux is attenuated due to absorption and possibly compton - scattering , the ratio of the x - ray flux to these tracers of intrinsic agn power can probe the amount of obscuration present and has been used extensively in previous studies ( e.g. bassani et al . 1999 , heckman et al .",

    "we list the values of these obscuration diagnostic flux ratios in table [ obs_table ] .",
    "there are , however , several limitations to using the [ oiii ] and mir fluxes in tracing the intrinsic agn flux : the [ oiii ] flux could be heavily affected by dust in the host galaxy and star formation processes can contaminate the mir flux ( see @xcite for a comparison between f@xmath31/f@xmath32}$ ] between the two samples ) . in @xcite , we noted that applying the standard r=3.1 reddening correction utilizing the balmer decrement introduced errors that did not better recover the intrinsic [ oiii ] emission for the 12@xmath0 m sample , likely due to uncertainties in the h@xmath12 measurements from the literature . due to uncertainties in correcting the [ oiii ] and mir fluxes for contamination",
    ", we use the observed parameters , with the caveat that these may not accurately probe intrinsic agn emission for some sources .",
    "we discuss the implications of such biases below .",
    "we plot the distributions of f@xmath10/f@xmath32,obs}$ ] , f@xmath10/f@xmath33}$ ] and f@xmath10/f@xmath31 in figure [ cthick_hist ] where the red dashed histogram represents the [ oiii]-sample , the dark blue histogram denotes the non - variable 12@xmath0 m sources and the cyan histogram reflects the variable 12@xmath0 m sources , using the average x - ray flux among the multiple observations for each source . a wide range of values is evident in all three plots .",
    "we compared our values with sy1 sources , with the average flux ratio and spread delineated by the grey shaded regions in figure [ cthick_hist ] .",
    "the sy1 comparison sample are culled from : a ) @xcite ( heterogeneous [ oiii]-bright sample , log ( @xmath34f@xmath10/f@xmath32,obs}>$ ] ) = 1.59@xmath350.49 dex ) , b ) @xcite ( drawn from the revised shapley - ames catalog , log ( @xmath34f@xmath10/f@xmath33}>$ ] ) = 1.92@xmath350.60 dex ) and c)@xcite ( where f@xmath31 is calculated at 12.3@xmath0 m with visir @xcite observations of sys selected from @xcite and those with existing or planned hard ( 14 - 195 kev ) x - ray observations , log ( @xmath34f@xmath10/f@xmath36 ) = -0.34@xmath350.30 dex ) .",
    "we note that @xcite report absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity whereas the other sy1 comparison samples utilize the observed luminosity .",
    "this correction shifts the f@xmath10/f@xmath31 sy1 ratios to higher values , though such a correction could be expected to be minimal for type 1 agn which are thought to be largely unobscured .",
    "also , not correcting [ oiii ] flux for reddening and mir flux for starburst contamination could possibly result in obscuration diagnostic ratios that are larger or smaller respectively , and though this affects several individual galaxies with large amounts of dust and/or greater star formation activity , no such systematic trends for the sample as a whole are evident .",
    "yaqoob and murphy ( 2010 ) have demonstrated that the ratio of f@xmath10/f@xmath31 is more sensitive to the x - ray spectral slope and covering factor of the putative torus , rather than column density , indicating that a low ratio does not necessarily imply a compton - thick source .",
    "however , we find all three obscuration diagnostics to agree : the majority of sy2s have ratios an order of magnitude or lower than their sy1 counterparts , which may indicate compton - thick absorption",
    ".    this trend is further illustrated by figure [ lx_l_iso ] , which plots the observed x - ray luminosity as a function of intrinsic agn luminosity proxies , with the best - fit relationship for sy1s overplotted . here , the red triangles represent the [ oiii]-sample , the blue diamonds denote the non - variable 12@xmath0 m sources and the cyan diamonds reflect the variable 12@xmath0 m sources , with the individual x - ray fluxes ( see table [ flux ] ) plotted for each variable source and connected by a solid line . the relationship for the sy1 sources",
    "were calculated by multiple linear regression ( i.e. regress routine in idl ) for the @xcite and @xcite samples ; for the mir relationship , we utilized the best - fit parameters from @xcite for their sy1 subsample .",
    "the majority of sy2s lie well below the relations for sy1s , demonstrating that these type 2 agn have weaker observed x - ray emission .    as the x - ray and optical and ir observations were not carried out simultaneously , it is possible that variability in the source could be responsible for the disagreements between the x - ray flux and intrinsic flux proxies .",
    "such a scenario can be realized if the x - ray observations are made after the central source has `` shut - off '' ( postulated to explain the discrepancy between the type 1 optical spectrum yet reprocessing - dominated x - ray spectrum for ngc 4051 , see @xcite and references therein ) , or the converse , where optical observations are made during a sedentary state and x - ray observations catch the source in active state ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "though we can not rule out variability as contributing to the discrepancy between the x - ray luminosity and intrinsic agn luminosity proxies for any individual source , such an effect can not be responsible for the overall trend in this sample .",
    "variability in sy1 samples contributes to the dispersion in l@xmath37/l@xmath38 ratios , yet they exhibit systematically higher x - ray luminosity ( normalized by intrinsic agn power ) than sy2s ( figures [ cthick_hist ] and [ lx_l_iso ] ) .",
    "this is confirmed by two - sample tests where we employed survival analysis ( asurv rev 1.2 , isobe and feigelson 1990 ; lavalley , isobe and feigelson 1992 ; feigelson and nelson 1985 for univariate problems ) to account for upper limits in the x - ray flux .",
    "the sy1 and sy2 obscuration diagnostic ratios differ at a statistically significant level ( @xmath39 1@xmath40 probability that they are drawn from the same parent population ) , which would not be expected if variability was the main driver for the discrepancy between intrinsic agn flux and observed x - ray flux .",
    "we have demonstrated that the majority of sy2s in our samples are under - luminous in x - ray emission as compared to sy1s , but is this trend due to obscuration or inherent x - ray weakness ?",
    "the ew of the neutral fe k@xmath4 line can differentiate between these two possibilities and is thus another obscuration diagnostic .",
    "in heavily obscured sources , the agn continuum is suppressed , whereas the fe k@xmath4 line is viewed in reflection , leading to a large fe k@xmath4 ew ( several hundred ev to several kev , e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 , levenson et al .",
    "2002 ) . in figure [ ew_ratios ] , fe k@xmath4 ew",
    "is plotted as a function of obscuration diagnostic ratios .",
    "a clear anti - correlation is present which is statistically significant according to survival analysis ( isobe et al .",
    "1986 for bivariate problems ) : we obtain spearman s @xmath41 values of -0.648 , -0.657 and -0.645 for fe k@xmath4 ew vs. f@xmath10/f@xmath32,obs}$ ] , f@xmath10/f@xmath33}$ ] and f@xmath10/f@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these best - fit correlations are overplotted for each relation in figure [ ew_ratios ] .",
    "the decrease of observed x - ray flux , normalized by intrinsic agn flux , with increasing fe k@xmath4 ew indicates that obscuration is responsible for attenuating x - ray emission in these sy2s .",
    "these results are consistent with the three - dimensional diagnostic diagram of bassani et al .",
    "1999 which shows a correlation between fe k@xmath4 ew and column density which anti - correlates with f@xmath10/f@xmath32,corr}$ ] ( where f@xmath32,corr}$ ] is the redenning corrected [ oiii ] flux ) .",
    "not only do a majority of this combined sy2 sample exhibit trademarks of compton - thick obscuration ( an order of magnitude lower f@xmath10/f@xmath38 ratios than sy1s and large fe k@xmath4 ew values ) , but a wide range of these diagnostic values are evident .",
    "no clear separation exists between compton - thick and compton - thin sub - populations . also , though the diagnostic flux ratios generally point to the same sources as having compton - thick obscuration , not all three ratios agree for a handful of sources ( e.g. f05189 - 2524 , ngc 5347 , arp 220 , ngc 4388 and ngc 7582 ) : some ratios indicate a compton - thin source whereas others suggest compton - thick . as the various intrinsic agn indicators exhibit some scatter in inter - comparisons ( see e.g. lamassa et al .",
    "2010 ) , a spread in f@xmath10/f@xmath38 values is expected . for f05189 - 2524 , ngc 5347 and arp 220",
    ", this discrepancy could be due to dust in the host galaxy affecting the [ oiii ] line , as mentioned above and/or large amounts of dust in the host galaxy boosting the mir flux .",
    "the 2005 _ xmm - newton _ observation of ngc 7582 has a f@xmath10/f@xmath32,obs}$ ] value marginally higher than the nominal compton - thick / compton - thin boundary , so the three flux ratio diagnostics may be considered to agree .",
    "however , the biases discussed previously in the observed [ oiii ] flux and mir flux can not account for the disagreement of the diagnostic flux ratios in the _ chandra _ and july _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 4388 and the 2001 _ xmm - newton _ observation of ngc 7582 , where f@xmath10/f@xmath33}$ ] point to the sources being compton - thick at these stages , but the other ratios suggest a compton - thin nature .",
    "similarly , an fe k@xmath4 ew of 1 kev is often cited as the nominal boundary for a compton - thick source based on observations ( e.g. bassani et al .",
    "1999 , comastri 2004 , levenson et al .",
    "2006 ) , yet ngc 1068 , the archetype for a compton - thick sy2 @xcite , has a measured ew of 0.60@xmath42 kev ( in agreement with pounds & vaughan 2006 but not matt et al .",
    "2004 , see appendix ) .",
    "hence , though the diagnostics presented here can help in uncovering the possible compton - thick nature of a type 2 agn , nominal boundaries should be considered approximate , especially since a continuum of both diagnostic flux ratios and fe k@xmath4 ews are present .",
    "as both sub - samples were selected based on intrinsic agn proxies and the majority is likely compton - thick , this implies that heavily obscured sources could constitute most of the local agn population .",
    "x - ray surveys in the 2 - 10 kev range , biased against these compton - thick type 2 agns , would thus miss a significant portion of the population . indeed , heckman et al .",
    "2005 find that the luminosity function ( which parametrizes the number of sources per luminosity per volume ) for x - ray selected agn is lower than the luminosity function for optically ( [ oiii ] ) selected sources .",
    "however , recent work ( trouille & barger 2010 , georgantopoulos & akylas 2010 ) leads to the opposite conclusion , namely agreement between [ oiii ] and x - ray luminosity functions . as georgantopoulos & akylas ( 2010 ) point out , though the luminosity functions are similar , the selection techniques tend to find different objects , with [ oiii]-selection favoring the x - ray weak sources .",
    "hence , the number of sources per volume per luminosity may be comparable , but any one selection technique does not sample the full population .",
    "for instance , yan et al . (",
    "2010 ) found that only 22% of their 288 optically selected agns are detected in the 200 ks _",
    "chandra _ extended groth strip survey , and they attribute the non - detection of the majority of the remaining sources to heavy toroidal obscuration .",
    "conversely , x - ray selection can identify agn that are categorized as star - forming galaxies by optical emission line diagnostics . for instance , yan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) note that about 20% of the x - ray sources identified as star - forming galaxies from optical emission lines have x - ray emission in excess of that explicable by star - formation , indicating the presence of an agn .",
    "this finding is similar to the results of trouille & barger 2010 who find that at least 20% of x - ray selected agn in their sample are identified as star - forming according to optical diagnostics .",
    "perhaps such competing biases work in concert to produce similar [ oiii ] and x - ray luminosity functions .        here ,",
    "we explore the relationship between obscuration diagnostics and the column densities ( n@xmath43 ) derived from spectral fitting . in figure",
    "[ nh_cthick ] , we plot the fitted column densities as a function of f@xmath10/f@xmath38 and fe k@xmath4 ew for the 12@xmath0 m sample ( see lamassa et al .",

    "the fitted n@xmath43 values approximately trace the degree of absorption implied by the obscuration diagnostics .",
    "however , a handful of sources lay several orders of magnitude below this trend , and are labeled in figure [ nh_cthick ] .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of cappi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where several sy2s have fitted n@xmath43 values an order of magnitude below that suggested by f@xmath37/f@xmath32,obs}$ ] . both f@xmath10/f@xmath38 and the fe k@xmath4 ew diagnostics point to the same sources as being anomalous , with ngc 3982 and ngc 4501 missing from the fe k@xmath4 plot due to having an unconstrained ew or upper limit on the ew , respectively .",
    "all five of these sources required only a single power law model ( with a thermal component in many cases ) to adequately fit the spectrum .",
    "the low observed x - ray fluxes and high fe k@xmath4 ew values indicate that the emission is primarily seen in scattering and/or reflection , rather than transmission through the obscuring medium .",
    "hence such fitted n@xmath43 values are likely associated with the line of sight absorption to the scattered / reflected component , suggesting that simple models of a foreground screen extincting the central source do not always recover the intrinsic absorption .",
    "partial covering models , parametrized in this work by a double absorbed power law with the two photon indices tied together , can also misrepresent the inherent column density .",
    "for example , such a model fairly fit the spectra for ngc 1068 ( @xmath19=450.4 with 247 degrees of freedom ) , yet the best fit n@xmath43 was @xmath179@xmath44 @xmath3 whereas the lower limit on this column density from higher energy observations is 10@xmath45 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "though a partial covering model could more realistically represent the geometry of the system , assuming a certain percentage of transmitted light through the obscuring medium with the rest scattered into the line of sight , it could be subject to the same limitations discussed above for single absorbed power law models .    published n@xmath43 distributions could potentially be biased , skewed to lower values , though checks based on obscuration diagnostics can help mitigate this problem .",
    "for example , akylas et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analyzed the x - ray spectra for 359 sources from _ xmm - newton _ and the _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdfs ) , deriving intrinsic column densities from fitted n@xmath43 values though adopting a column density of 5@xmath46 10@xmath47 @xmath3 for the cases where @xmath48 1 , a signature of compton - thick obscuration .",
    "however , as cappi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) note , this criterion could indicate a compton - thick source while the fe k@xmath4 ew and flux diagnostics suggest compton - thin ( e.g. ngc 4138 and ngc 4258 ) or vice versa ( e.g. ngc 3079 ) .",
    "tozzi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) use a reflection model ( pexrav in xspec ) for compton - thick sources in the cdfs , which are defined as those agn with a better fit statistic using pexrav than an absorbed power law model .",
    "however , as murphy & yaqoob point out ( 2009 ) , such a model describes reflection off of an accretion disk , which is not physically relevant for the putative torus obscuration .",
    "derived n@xmath43 values could then potentially be suspect for some sources .",
    "other diagnostics are therefore crucial in checking the reliability of fitted n@xmath43 values .",
    "for example , krumpe et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find the ratio of x - ray to optical flux , as well as the non - detection of an fe k@xmath4 line in the stacked spectrum of 14 type ii qsos ( agn with intrinsic l@xmath49 10@xmath50 erg / s ) , to verify their distribution of moderately absorbed , but not compton - thick , column densities .",
    "it is intriguing to note that all x - ray variable sources in this study are on the high end of the obscuration flux diagnostics ( see figures [ cthick_hist ] and [ lx_l_iso ] ) .",
    "these high f@xmath37/f@xmath38 flux ratios may indicate that the x - ray emission from the central source is seen directly .",
    "however , the high fe k@xmath4 ew for the _ chandra _ and july 2002 observations of ngc 4388 ( 0.29@xmath51 kev and 0.62@xmath52 kev , respectively ) and for the _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 7582 ( 0.58@xmath53 kev and 0.31@xmath42 kev ) are higher than predicted for transmission - dominated spectra , where the ew with respect to the primary transmitted emission is @xmath340.18 kev @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose a double absorption geometry to account for the variability in ngc 7582 : a `` thick '' absorber which attenuates just the central source , attributed to the putative torus , and a `` thin '' absorber which enshrouds the primary and reflected emission and is located externally to the torus .",
    "they postulate that this inner , `` thick '' absorber is inhomogeneous , accounting for the observed x - ray variability",
    ". a similar scenario may be present for ngc 4388 and be responsible for both sources switching from transmitted - dominated to reflection - dominated states ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the fe k@xmath4 ews for the two other variable sources , ngc 5506 and ngc 7172 , as well as the flux ratio diagnostics are consistent with compton - thin sources , implying the central source is consistently viewed directly .      here",
    "we investigate whether compton - thick sources differ from their compton - thin counterparts in terms of host galaxy and agn properties .",
    "in particular , we examined whether systematic differences exist in intrinsic agn power , eddington ratio ( l@xmath54/l@xmath55 ) , central black hole mass ( m@xmath56 ) , the agn contribution to the ionization field , and star formation activity . the results are summarized in figures [ liso_c_thick ] through [ alpha_c_thick ] and in table [ host_prob ] , where we utilized survival analysis to calculate spearman @xmath41 values and the associated probabilities that the obscuration diagnostics are uncorrelated with host galaxy properties : p@xmath340.05 indicates that the quantities are significantly correlated ( @xmath252@xmath16 level ) .",
    "the values of the relevant host galaxy parameters used in this analysis are presented in @xcite .    to test whether compton - thick sources have unique agn properties , we searched for correlations between toroidal obscuration and intrinsic agn luminosity , accretion rate and central black hole mass ( m@xmath56 measured using velocity dispersion and the m-@xmath16 relation @xcite .",

    "2010 for literature references to m@xmath56 for the 12@xmath0 m sample ; velocity dispersions for the [ oiii]-sample were derived from sdss . ] ) .",
    "as discussed previously , the [ oiv ] 25.89@xmath0 m line serves as a robust proxy of intrinsic agn flux as it is mainly ionized by the central engine and not affected by host galaxy reddening as the [ oiii ] line is ( e.g. melndez et al .",
    "2008 , diamond - stanic et al .",
    "2009 , rigby et al 2009 ) .",

    "figure [ liso_c_thick ] , however , shows these dependencies to be weak with a wide scatter , especially considering the error bars which can not be accommodated in the survival analysis calculation .",

    "could there be a relation between the obscuration shrouding the central engine and the large amounts of dust and gas necessary for starburst activity ?",
    "as levenson et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) point out , ngc 5135 and ngc 7130 ( both members of the 12@xmath0 m sample ) are starburst galaxies that likely harbor compton - thick agn .",

    "these results suggest that the gas responsible for starburst processes likely originates in regions of the galaxy not associated with the putative torus , and similarly that gas from the interstellar medium does not contribute significantly to toroidal agn obscuration in hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - rays .      in order to confirm a source as compton - thick , observations at higher energies ( @xmath3010 kev )",
    "are necessary .",
    "the spectral characteristic of heavily obscured agn is the so - called `` compton - hump '' , a peak in the spectrum between 20 - 30 kev which is caused by the competing effects of absorption on the low - energy end and compton down - scattering on the high energy range . the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) , to be launched in 2012 , is sensitive in the 5 - 80 kev band , and could thus confirm our obscured candidates as compton - thick sources , if they are detected .    to test",

    "we find that all but five sources from the 12@xmath0 m sample ( ngc 1386 , ngc 1667 , tololo 1238 - 364 , ngc 4968 and ngc 6890 ) and four from the [ oiii]-sample ( 2masx 08035923 + 2345201 , 2masx j10181928 + 3722419 , 2masx j13463217 + 6423247 and ngc 5695 ) will be detected with exposure times less than 100 ks ( see appendix ) .",

    "thus a majority of these sources are potentially compton - thick , consistent with the results of previous studies ( e.g. risaliti 1999 ) .",
    "a wide range of obscuration diagnostic values are present , indicating a continuum of column densities and/or inclination angles , rather than a clear segregation into compton - thick and compton - thin sub - populations .",
    "though the diagnostics do generally point to the same sources as likely heavily absorbed , disagreement does exist for a handful of sy2s .",
    "such a discrepancy is to be expected based on the various biases affecting the observed intrinsic flux proxies and the inherent spread in such isotropic flux indicators ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , nominal compton - thick boundaries should be considered approximate .",
    "though recent work ( @xcite , @xcite ) shows the luminosity functions for x - ray selected and [ oiii]-selected agn to be consistent , the various selection techniques favor differ classes of objects .",
    "heavily obscured sources , present in optically selected samples , are missing from 2 - 10 kev x - ray samples .",
    "sample selection based on intrinsic flux proxies are therefore necessary to include the compton - thick population , especially since highly absorbed sources constitute the majority of our homogeneously selected samples .",
    "though fitted column densities generally tend to trace the absorption implied by obscuration diagnostics , several glaring inconsistencies are present .",
    "such discrepancies are most extreme when the hard x - ray spectrum is best fit by a single absorbed power law , implying that the simple geometry of a foreground screen attenuating the central source does not recover the intrinsic absorption .",
    "this could result from scattering and/or reflected emission dominating over the transmitted continuum , where the fitted column density reflects line of sight absorption rather than the obscuration enshrouding the agn .",
    "such a result indicates that published n@xmath43 distributions derived from single absorbed power law models can be similarly biased , systematically under - representing the intrinsic column density of type 2 agn .",
    "other diagnostics are therefore crucial in checking the validity of fitted column densities",
    ". 5 .   the x - ray variable sy2s populate the less obscured range of the flux ratio obscuration diagnostics .",
    "two of these sources ( ngc 4388 and ngc 7582 ) do show evidence of switching to a reflection - dominated state , as indicated by the change in the fe k@xmath4 ews .",
    "as piconcelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest , this change could reflect an inhomogeneous thick absorber covering the central source , with a thin absorber attenuating both the reflected and transmitted emission .",
    "the other two variable sources ( ngc 5506 and ngc 7172 ) show signs of compton - thin absorption , suggesting that the central source is viewed directly .",
    "we do not find compelling evidence that compton - thick sources have unique agn properties ( intrinsic agn luminosity , accretion rate and central black hole mass ) or star formation activity .",
    "though three out of four obscuration diagnostics are significantly correlated with intrinsic agn luminosity , the significance is marginal and the relationships display a wide scatter .",
    "evidence linking more obscured sources to more luminous central engines is therefore tenuous at best .",
    "no correlation exists between toroidal agn obscuration and the relative amount of ionization due to the central engine compared to star formation processes ( f@xmath33}$]/f@xmath58}$ ] , ew of the 17@xmath0 m pah feature , @xmath60 ) and agn absorption .",
    "though several starburst galaxies do seem to host compton - thick agn ( e.g. levenson et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) , such a relation is not present globally .",
    "hence , we conclude that the gas responsible for star formation processes is not associated with the toroidal obscuration hiding the central engine .",
    "7 .   based on simulated high - energy ( 10 - 40 kev )",
    "spectra using the best - fit modeling of the 2 - 10 kev spectra , we estimate that the majority of this sample ( 36 out of 45 ) will be detected if observed by nustar .",
    "the more heavily obscured sources which have not been detected by bat surveys could likely be identified by nustar as this future mission will probe to lower flux levels ( @xmath172@xmath62 erg s@xmath15 @xmath3 vs. @xmath63 erg s@xmath15 @xmath3 ) .",
    "these observations would confirm whether the heavily absorbed sources are indeed compton - thick .",
