    "the notion of a random lift was proposed by amit and linial @xcite as a discrete version of the topological notion of covering maps , which are `` locally bijective '' homomorphisms . for graphs @xmath0 and @xmath3 , a map @xmath4 is a _ covering map _ from @xmath3 to @xmath0 if for every @xmath5 the restriction of @xmath6 to the neighborhood of @xmath7 is a bijection onto the neighborhood of @xmath8 . in particular , for every vertex @xmath5 the degree of @xmath7 must be the same as the degree of @xmath9 .",
    "the set of all vertices which are mapped onto a vertex @xmath7 is called the _ fiber above @xmath7 _ and denoted by @xmath10 . since the term covering has been already widely used in graph theory , following amit and linial , we use the term _ lift _ instead .",
    "for instance , we say that @xmath3 from the previous example is a lift of @xmath0 .",
    "we often denote the lift of @xmath0 by @xmath11 .",
    "if for every vertex @xmath12 the fiber @xmath10 has size @xmath1 , then we call such a lift an _ @xmath1-lift_. we denote the set of all @xmath1-lifts of a given graph @xmath0 by @xmath13 and call @xmath0 the _ base graph_. a random @xmath1-lift of @xmath0 is a graph chosen uniformly at random from the set @xmath13 .",
    "this is equivalent to associating with each vertex @xmath14 a set @xmath15 of @xmath1 vertices and independently connecting each pair @xmath16 by a random matching whenever @xmath17 and @xmath7 are adjacent in the base graph  @xmath0 .",
    "another way to describe this process is to take @xmath18 and @xmath19 , choose uniformly at random one of the @xmath20 permutations @xmath21\\to [ n]$ ] , and connect @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "note that such permutations ( or matching ) are chosen independently for each edge @xmath24 in @xmath0 .",
    "our interest lies in the asymptotic properties of lifts of graphs , when the parameter @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "in particular , we say that a property holds _ asymptotically almost surely _ , or , briefly , _ aas _ , if its probability tends to @xmath25 as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "sometimes , instead of saying that the random lift of @xmath0 has aas a property @xmath26 , we write that almost every random lift of a graph @xmath0 has @xmath26 . the first paper in the theory of random lifts of graphs dealt with their connectivity properties . amit and linial",

    "here we consider the property that a graph contains a hamilton cycle .",
    "the two main problems concerning hamiltonicity of random lifts , has been stated by linial @xcite who asked the following two questions .",
    "is it true that for a given @xmath0 the random lift @xmath13 is either aas hamitonian , or aas non hamiltonian ?",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected @xmath38-regular graph with @xmath39 .",
    "is it true that random @xmath1-lift of @xmath0 is aas hamiltonian ?",
