    "this is done by projecting out the helicity form factors directly from data without the use of fitting functions .",
    "our results will allow theorists to directly compare their models with the data free from parameterization .",
    "we also confirm the existence of the @xmath14-wave component , study its form factor for the first time , and limit the strength of possible @xmath5- and @xmath6-wave contributions .",
    "there are several good reasons to perform this analysis using the cleo - c data : the @xmath8 resolution in is an order of magnitude better than in focus . in addition , the @xmath19 process is simpler than @xmath20 , since there is a negligible probability for the much less massive @xmath21 to be left - handed which eliminates one of the form factors .",
