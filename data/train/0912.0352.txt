    "how to improve the injection efficiency of spin - polarized electrons from a ferromagnetic ( fm ) contact into a semiconductor microstructure has puzzled the researchers in the field of spintronics for many years.@xcite due to the mismatch of conductivity between fm metal and semiconductor , spin polarization is almost lost at the interface,@xcite and spin injection efficiency is very low.@xcite to now , various ideas have been proposed to solve this problem .",
    "rashba@xcite suggested that tunnel contacts can dramatically increase spin injection efficiency , which was supported by subsequent theoretical works.@xcite jiang et al.@xcite demonstrated that the spin injection efficiency could be improved dramatically by inserting a mgo tunnel barrier between the ferromagnetic contact and the semiconductor .",
    "optical injection of spin - polarized carriers across a mismatched heterostructure is an effective method . by using circular polarized excitation and detection",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the injected spin - polarized carriers are quite robust and maintain their polarization memory even after passing through a dense array of misfit dislocations.@xcite however , it is still desirable to establish electrical , rather than optical , methods to achieve effective spin injection .    in strongly - correlated electron systems ,",
    "spin dipole - dipole interactions between electrons play important roles , which determine the systems magnetism , specific heat , and other ground - state properties . in the weak coupling and strong coulomb repulsion regime ,",
    "the heisenberg - type exchange interaction @xmath0 can be derived through perturbation analysis ( e.g. , schrieffer - wolf transformation ) . for electronic transport in mesoscopic systems , electronic spin correlation drastically affects the conductance and the current correlation.@xcite for instance , the double quantum dot ( qd ) system enables the realization of the two - impurity kondo problem , in which a competition between kondo correlation and antiferromagnetic impurity - spin correlation leads to a quantum critical phenomenon.@xcite for the case of spin - polarized transport , the polarized spin in one dot behaves like an effective magnetic field and affects the spin transport in another dot through indirect spin - spin interaction between two dots.@xcite therefore , it is expected that exchange interaction can induce efficient spin injection in qd systems .    in this work",
    "we propose an electrical and internal scheme to improve the spin injection efficiency based on a double quantum dot system , where each dot is connected with two fm electrodes .",
    "two different configurations are examined , one is the magnetizations of four fm electrodes are parallel with each other , and the other is one of them has antiparallel magnetization with other three ones .",
    "we find that in the latter case , due to the exchange interaction between electrons in the double dot , the spin - polarization rate of the current through one dot is greatly enhanced , while the spin - polarization rate through the other one is drastically suppressed . as for the case of two parallel and two antiparallel , spin - down electrons can hardly occupy the two dots , while the spin - up ones dominate in both of the two dots during transport processes , thus the exchange interaction can not greatly enhance the current polarization .",
    "the structure is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . dot @xmath1 ( @xmath21,2 ) is connected to fm leads @xmath1l and @xmath1r .",
    "the magnetizations of leads 1l , 2l , and 2r are parallel , while that of lead 1r can be parallel or antiparallel with the other three .",
    "we model this system with the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the fm leads are described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons with wave vector @xmath7 in lead @xmath8 , @xmath9l , r .",
    "the isolated double dot are described by @xmath10 .",
    "here @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons with spin @xmath13 in dot @xmath1 , @xmath14 is the occupation operator , and @xmath15 stands for the intradot coulomb repulsion .",
    "the last term denotes the heisenberg exchange coupling with the exchange coupling parameter @xmath16 and the spin operator @xmath17@xmath18 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the direct interdot tunneling and interdot coulomb repulsion.@xcite the tunneling hamiltonian between dots and leads is @xmath19 . in the following , we assume the coupling coefficient @xmath20 to be independent of @xmath7 and @xmath21 , thus the double occupation of each dot is forbidden .",
    "since the exchange interaction is considered , it is natural to describe the double dot system by triplet and singlet states , which are defined as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( triplet states ) , and @xmath25 ( singlet state ) . following the procedure in previous works,@xcite we use nine slave - boson operators to represent these dirac brackets : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31",

    "first we show relevant results for single qd system connected to two fm leads.@xcite the spin components of the current are @xmath60 .",

    "when the bias rises beyond region i , both @xmath83 and @xmath82 return to 0.4 .",
    "so in the p configuration we can not enhance @xmath82 from its original value in single dot case .    in the ap configuration",
    ", @xmath82 can be strongly modified from the single dot case by the exchange interaction ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . figs .",
    "3(a ) indicates both @xmath69 and @xmath70 increase monotonously with the bias , which is similar to that in the p configuration .",
    "however , from region i to region iii , the discrepancy between @xmath69 and @xmath70 keeps increasing , resulting in the enhancement of @xmath82 in fig .",
    "3(b ) . in region iii ,",
    "@xmath82 approaches 0.7 , which is much larger than its original value 0.4 in single dot system . at the same time",
    ", @xmath83 keeps decreasing when bias increases from region i to region iii , and finally becomes smaller than 0.1 .",
    "it is concluded that in the ap configuration one can greatly enhance the current polarization rate through one dot , accompanied by decrease of the current polarization rate through another dot .",
    "such phenomenon looks as if the current polarization rate is  transferred \" from one circuit to the other .",
    "the enhancement of the current polarization rate can be understood with the aid of the expression of the current . due to the absence of intradot",
    "spin flips , both the amplitude and spin polarization of the total current through dot @xmath84 are conserved , i.e. , @xmath85 . for simplicity",
    ", the current @xmath86 is chosen in the calculation because it has an uniform expression in all three regions : @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the first term denotes the process that one electron tunnels through dot 2 via the energy level @xmath73 , and the second to fourth terms denote the processes that one electron with spin @xmath13 transports through dot 2 via the triplet states and the singlet state .",
    "because in @xmath88 and @xmath89 states , electrons with spin @xmath13 or @xmath90 have the same probability to occupy dot 2 , both the third and the fourth terms have a factor @xmath91 . from fig .",
    "3(b ) , in region i we can see @xmath82 is slightly larger than @xmath49 . in this region ,",
    "only the energy level @xmath72 enters the bias window , and electrons can only form the singlet state , which makes @xmath92 much larger than other elements [ see figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) ] .",
    "thus , the forth term dominates in expression of the current , and we have @xmath93 , @xmath94 . when the effects of @xmath95 and @xmath96 are considered , the value of @xmath82 is slightly modified . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) we can obtain @xmath97 $ ] . here",
    "we denote @xmath98 , then @xmath99 , except for @xmath100 .",
    "thus , @xmath101>\\rho_{2\\downarrow}\\approx\\rho_{s}/[2(3+\\gamma^{\\uparrow}/\\gamma^{\\downarrow})]$ ] , and @xmath82 is enhanced from 0.4 , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . in region",
    "i , @xmath92 is much larger than other elements , which means that during most of the time electrons in the double dot form the singlet state .",
    "so @xmath95 is mainly contributed by the process that an electron in dot 1 tunnels to lead 1r and breaks the singlet state . noticing that in such a configuration , @xmath102 , electron with spin @xmath103 can tunnel to lead 1r more easily , and left an electron with spin @xmath104 in dot 2 , which makes @xmath105 .",
    "when the bias locates in region ii , the direct tunneling channel at @xmath73 opens .",
    "we can see the enhancement of @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) is larger than @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , which results in further increase of @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath110/(\\gamma^{\\sigma}_{1l}+\\gamma^{\\bar{\\sigma}}_{1l}+\\gamma^{\\sigma}_{2r})$ ] .",
    "it is obvious that the increase of @xmath95 is mainly owing to the term @xmath111 in the numerator , which is absent in region i. following the same procedure , this term reads @xmath112 , so the increase of @xmath106 is larger than that of @xmath108 , and @xmath82 is enhanced from its value in region i.    when the bias enters region iii , @xmath95 and @xmath96 keep increasing , and the enhancement of @xmath107 is much more than other elements .",
    "this is because now the channel at @xmath74 opens , and if dot 1 is occupied , electrons in lead 2l can directly tunnel into dot 2 and form the triplet state @xmath113 .",
    "since lead 1r is in antiparallel with lead 1l , in most of the time , dot 1 is occupied by one electron with spin @xmath104 . as a consequence , electrons with spin @xmath104 in lead 2l",
    "is more available to tunnel into dot 2 and form the triplet state @xmath114 , which makes @xmath115 .",
    "this can also be seen in the formula @xmath116 , where the first term in the numerator makes @xmath107 increase intensively in region iii .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is greatly enhanced in region iii .",
    "in the case of @xmath59 , the analytical expressions in region i , ii , and iii are @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , respectively . for @xmath49 , @xmath120 0.454 , 0.542 , and 0.673 ,",
    "which is consistent with our numerical results .",
    "as expected , when @xmath121 , @xmath122 in all regions .",
    "if we tune the bias into region iii , the injection efficiency can be enhanced to almost twice of its original value . in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) , we present the variations of @xmath82 with @xmath123 for different situations . it can be seen that when @xmath123 is small , @xmath82 is greatly enhanced by the exchange interaction .",
    "in summary , we propose a scheme based on a four - terminal double quantum dot system to improve the spin injection efficiency greatly . we find that in the antiparallel configuration , the spin - polarization rate through one quantum dot can be dramatically enhanced , while the polarization rate through the other one is suppressed .",
    "the operating mechanism is the exchange interaction between the two quantum dots ."
