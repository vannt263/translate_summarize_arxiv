    "when the strategy for the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) was first being formulated in the mid-1980 s , the goals were two - fold : first , to sample a fair volume of the local universe ( what are the largest coherent structures ? at what point does the universe start to look smooth ? ) , and , second , to study clustering on large scales ( @xmath4 , void statistics , ... ) .",
    "therefore , it was decided to survey an unfilled `` checkerboard '' pattern in both the north and the south galactic caps out to a redshift of @xmath5 . to facilitate these ends",
    ", it was decided to use a 50-fiber multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) to obtain the radial velocities .",
    "this was circa 1986/87 .",
    "a few years into the survey ( circa 1990/91 ) , the survey strategy evolved into what became its final form : a set of six filled - in slices  three in the north galactic cap , and three in the south . also during this time frame , the mos was upgraded to 112-fibers .",
    "the maps that were gradually built up over the course of the survey eventually began to show an intriguing picture  that of a universe which looked smooth on large scales ! visually , there was little or no evidence in the lcrs slices for high - contrast coherent structures on scales @xmath0  mpc .",
    "quantitative evidence has tended to support this initial view ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "8 of @xcite and fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "at the other extreme , on relatively small scales ( @xmath1  mpc ) , the lcrs has generally confirmed what had been observed in previous , shallower surveys ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "but what about scales near the transition to homogeneity ( 50  200@xmath2  mpc ) ? what can the lcrs tell us about clustering on these scales ?",
    "on very large scales ( @xmath6  mpc ) , it makes sense to think of an individual lcrs slice as a 2-dimensional plane , since the third dimension of slice width does not contribute much to our understanding of clustering on these scales ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "now consider a `` toy '' universe composed of osculating spherical voids of diameter @xmath7  mpc .",
    "in such a universe , an lcrs slice would intersect several voids at various random positions .",
    "clearly , the measured cross - sectional diameters of these intersections will never overestimate the true diameter of the spheres ( in this case , @xmath7  mpc ) . on average ,",
    "the diameter of the cross - section of a sphere randomly intersecting a plane is @xmath8 thus , in such a `` toy '' universe , we would expect that an lcrs slice would typically underestimate the average void diameter by about @xmath9 .",
    "projection effect _ in real space is basically the same as the _ aliasing _ of power from large- to small - scales in fourier space . in real - space",
    ", however , this effect seems rather more benign and correctable .    with the above discussion in mind , what  if any  clustering",
    "do we see on scales of 50 ",
    "200@xmath2  mpc ?",
    "first , consider a couple visual representations of the lcrs @xmath10 slice , the most densely and most homogeneously sampled of the six lcrs slices .",
    "looking at a standard velocity - ra plot of this slice ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we may notice that the largest coherent high - contrast structures tend to form the walls of underdense regions ( `` voids '' ) 50 ",
    "100@xmath2  mpc in diameter . to remove radial and field - to - field selection effects",
    ", one can generate a smoothed number - density contrast map ( fig .",
    "3 ) ; therein , our initial suspicions are confirmed : high - density ( @xmath11 ) regions tend to surround low - density ( @xmath12 ) `` voids '' with diameters of 50  100@xmath2  mpc .",
    "second , we note that both the lcrs 2d power spectrum @xcite and large - scale ( @xmath13  mpc ) 3d spatial autocorrelation function @xcite indicate features of excess clustering on scales @xmath14  mpc .",
    "we note that the results from the 2d power spectrum show higher statistical significance , since the signal at these scales ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is essentially 2d ; at these scales , some of the signal is washed out in the 3d autocorrelation function analysis .",
    "third , doroshkevich et al.s core - sampling analysis @xcite of the lcrs measures the mean free path between 2d sheets and between 1d filaments . comparing @xcite s fig .  12 with our fig .",
    "3 , it is apparent that their sheet - like structures correspond roughly with regions of smoothed @xmath11 ; their rich filaments , with regions of smoothed @xmath15 .",
    "doroshkevich et al .",
    "measure the mean free path between sheets to be @xmath16 80  100  @xmath17  mpc @xcite .",
    "fourth , einasto et al .",
    "give evidence that abell clusters in rich superclusters tend to lie within a 3d `` chessboard '' of gridsize of @xmath18  mpc @xcite .",
    "einasto and his colleagues are presently performing a similar analysis for lcrs galaxies in rich environments @xcite ; in fact , our fig .  3 is from the early stages of that analysis .",
    "results , however , are still pending .",
    "there does seem to be something going on in the lcrs at a scale of @xmath3  mpc , but this result needs confirmation using other techniques ( e.g. , a 2d @xmath19 ) and using other large surveys covering different regions and/or having different selection effects ( e.g. , the esp @xcite , 2df @xcite , sdss @xcite , ... ) .    99 colless m.m .",
