    "it is a well - known fact ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the spectrum of periodic elliptic self - adjoint differential operators has band structure , i.e. it is a locally finite union of compact intervals called _ bands_. in general the bands may overlap , otherwise we have a _",
    "gap _ in the spectrum - a bounded open interval having an empty intersection with the spectrum , but with ends belonging to it .",
    "the presence of gaps in the spectrum is not guaranteed .",
    "for instance , the spectrum of the laplace operator in @xmath7 has no gaps : @xmath8 .",
    "therefore an interesting question arises here : to construct examples of periodic operators with non - void spectral gaps .",
    "this question is motivated by various applications , since the presence of gaps is important for the description of wave processes which are governed by differential operators under consideration : if the wave frequency belongs to a gap then the corresponding wave can not propagate in the medium .",
    "this feature is a main requirement for so - called photonic crystals , which are materials with periodic dielectric structure extensively investigating in recent years .",
    "the problem of existence of spectral gaps for various periodic operators has been actively studied since mid 90th .",
    "we refer to the overview @xcite , where one can find a lot of examples and references around this topic .    in the last years",
    "there appeared many works , where the problem of opening of spectral gaps for operators posed in unbounded domains with a waveguide geometry ( strips , tubes , graph - like domains , etc . )",
    "is studied , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the studies of physical processes ( e.g. , quantum particle motion ) in such domains are of a great physical and mathematical interest because of the big progress in microelectronics during the last decade .",
    "we refer to the recent monograph @xcite concerning spectral properties of quantum waveguides .",
    "the simplest way to open up a gap is either to perturb a straight cylinder by a periodic nucleation of small voids ( or making other `` small '' perturbation ) @xcite or to consider a waveguide consisting of an array of identical compact domains connected by narrow `` bridges '' @xcite . in the first case one",
    "has small gaps separating large bands , in the second case one gets large gaps and small bands .    in the current paper",
    "we present another example of neumann waveguide with a gap in the spectrum ; the geometry of this waveguide essentially differs from previously studied examples .",
    "we are motivated by our recent work @xcite , where the spectrum of some neumann problem was studied in a _ bounded _ domain perturbed by a lot of identical protuberances each of them consisting of two subsets - `` room '' and `` passage '' ( in the simplest case , `` room '' is a small square and `` passage '' is a narrow rectangle connecting the `` room '' with the main domain ) .",
    "peculiar spectral properties of so perturbed domains were observed for the first time by r.  courant and d.  hilbert @xcite .",
    "domains with `` room - and - passage''-like geometry are widely used in order to construct examples illustrating various phenomena in sobolev spaces theory and in spectral theory ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to show that perturbing a straight strip by a periodic array of `` room - and - passage '' protuberances one may open a spectral gap .",
    "namely , we consider a strip of a width @xmath9 and perturb it by a family of small identical protuberances , @xmath1-periodically distributed along the strip axis . here",
    "@xmath10 is a small parameter .",
    "each protuberance has `` room - and - passage '' geometry .",
    "we denote the obtained domain by @xmath0 ( see figure [ figure ] ) . in @xmath0",
    "we consider the operator @xmath11 , where @xmath3 is the neumann laplacian in @xmath12 .",
    "the weight @xmath4 is equal to @xmath5 everywhere except the union of the `` rooms '' , where it is equal to the constant @xmath13 .",
