    "the decoherence process followed by a given quantum physical system is a consequence of its unavoidable interaction with the environment .",
    "the ensuing non - unitary dynamics is usually modelled by a ( generalized ) master equation for the system s density operator . in the literature of open quantum systems ,",
    "master equations are usually called markovian if they did not involve an explicit time integration . otherwise , they are termed non - markovian .",
    "these designations , however , do not agree with the mathematical definitions of markovian and non - markovian processes , as was shown long ago @xcite . moreover , non - markovian master equations can be rewritten in time - local form ( without explicit time integration ) , as it was recently shown @xcite .",
    "thus , an alternative , more specific criterion , will be used in this paper to characterize non - markovian dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of a system is non - markovian if it can be described by a master equation of generalized lindblad form , with temporarily negative decay rates @xcite .    in order to estimate the effects of nonunitary dynamics on different quantum information processing protocols , it is customary to use several archetypal quantum operations on a qubit @xcite : the depolarizing , phase - damping ( or phase - flip ) and amplitude - damping channels .",
    "they are usually assumed to be markovian , with constant decay rates , in theoretical and experimental analyses @xcite . however , the description of decoherence in solid state systems , the most promising scalable realizations of quantum processors , often needs to be non - markovian @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to determine the generality of the analyses using the above mentioned noisy channels , and if the usual markovian assumption is unnecessary . the purpose of this manuscript is to show , explicitly , that the archetypal one - qubit noisy channels , described before , generally describe non - markovian dynamics .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mlk ] , a brief review is made of markov and lindblad master equations , kraus operator sum representation and the usual one qubit noisy channels .",
    "we consider quantum models of noise for one - qubit depolarizing ( section  [ sec : microdepolarizing ] ) , dephasing ( section  [ sec : microdephasing ] ) and amplitude damping ( section  [ sec : microdamping ] ) channels , and classical models of noise for one - qubit depolarizing ( section  [ sec : macrodepolarizing ] ) and dephasing ( section  [ sec : macrodephasing ] ) channels .",
    "these models are simple yet ( generally ) non - markovian models , where decoherence of the qubit is due to the fluctuation of macroscopic variables which enter in the hamiltonian or by the establishment of correlation betwen the system and its environment .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in the last section of the paper .",
    "a typical markovian master equation is a dynamical equation for @xmath0 , the density operator of the system of interest , which can be cast as @xmath1 + \\mathcal{l}_{\\textrm{\\relsize{-2}{d}}}\\hat{\\rho}_{\\textrm{\\relsize{-2}{s}}}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a time - independent ( super)operator . not all markovian master equations , however , can be written in this way , as we will see below .",
    "markovian master equations are important tools to model open quantum systems , not only due to their mathematical simplicity , but also because they capture the physical behavior of many important systems , such as open qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) systems @xcite .",
    "many markovian master equations can be derived from system - environment models employing the born - markov approximation @xcite , which relies on a series of assumptions which are not always satisfied @xcite : weak system - environment coupling , separable total density operator , bath correlation time much smaller than the relaxation time of the system , and unperturbed transition times of the system much smaller than its relaxation time .",
    "the next to last assumption implies that the environment is infinite .",
    "thus , loosely speaking , markovian behavior is typical of systems which interact weakly with infinite environments .",
    "sometimes , markovian master equations present unphysical behavior , because they lead to negative density operators @xcite .",
    "master equation of the lindblad form @xcite , which preserve the fundamental properties of density operators ( non - negativity , unit trace and hermicity ) , are also markovian .",
    "the standard form of lindblad master equations @xcite for the density operator of the system of interest , @xmath0 , is @xmath3\\\\ & \\nonumber + \\sum_i\\left(2\\,\\hat{l}_i\\,\\hat{\\rho}_{\\textrm{\\relsize{-2}{s}}}(t)\\,\\hat{l}_i^\\dagger-\\hat{l}_i^\\dagger\\,\\hat{l}_i\\,\\hat{\\rho}_{\\textrm{\\relsize{-2}{s}}}(t)-\\hat{\\rho}_{\\textrm{\\relsize{-2}{s}}}(t)\\,\\hat{l}_i^\\dagger\\,\\hat{l}_i\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a hamiltonian and @xmath5 are ( possibly non - hermitian ) operators , usually known as lindblad operators . for a given physical process",
    "the decomposition ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) is not unique .",
    "however , it is convenient to interpret the first term of the right hand side of ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) as the unitary evolution in the absence of interaction with the environment , and the second term as the environment - system coupling . despite their mathematical properties , under special conditions lindblad master equations can also exhibit unphysical behavior , like the unbounded increase of the system s energy @xcite .",
    "one of the alternatives to the use of generalized master equations to describe open quantum systems is the feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite .",
    "other , which was derived by kraus @xcite employing the idea of complete positivity , is known as the `` operator - sum representation '' of the quantum dynamics of an open system .",
    "the kraus representation of a decoherence process @xmath6 where the kraus operators @xmath7 satisfy the condition of probability conservation @xmath8 , gives the evolution of the density matrix of the system of interest .",
    "the operator sum representation and lindblad - form master equations can be related . in effect , if a closed quantum system , initially in a product state @xmath9 , comprises two interacting subsystems , the system of interest @xmath10 and its environment @xmath11 , the exact dynamics of the state of any of the subsystems can be put in kraus form . if the inequality @xmath12 is satisfied , where @xmath13 is the cutoff frequency of the bath density of states , @xmath14 an adequate coarse - graining time scale and @xmath15 the characteristic time - scale of the hamiltonian evolution of the system , then it is possible to derive a completely - positive master equation starting from the kraus operator - sum representation @xcite , linking both descriptions .",
    "the most popular quantum channels are the depolarizing , phase - damping ( or phase - flip ) and amplitude - damping one - qubit channels @xcite .",
    "we consider a qubit with orthonormal states @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this basis",
    "the operator @xmath18 is diagonal , and the lowering operator is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the depolarizing channel for a single qubit @xmath20 describes a process where the qubit , initially in its state @xmath21 , remains in this state with probability @xmath22 , and changes to the maximally mixed state @xmath23 with probability @xmath24 . another popular description of a depolarizing channel @xmath25 @xcite , emphasizes the probability of remaining in the same state , @xmath26 , in contrast to the probability of suffering an error .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath27 , that is , these probabilities are different : while @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "if a two - qubit mixed state is used , instead of a bell state , in the standard teleportation protocol , a generalized depolarizing channel is obtained @xcite .",
    "an amplitude damping channel is obtained when a qubit interacts with a large reservoir at zero temperature , or a two - level atom in the electromagnetic vacuum emits spontaneously @xcite .",
    "an exciton confined to a quantum dot and coupled to phonons @xcite , like a spin in a magnetic field whose strength fluctuates in time , suffers a dephasing process .    the markovian master equations , with constant decay rates , corresponding to the depolarizing , amplitude - damping and phase - damping channels are @xmath30 respectively , where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "these equations of motion , which do not have a hamiltonian contribution , were written to emphasize their lindblad form .",
    "the kraus representation is generally used in the area of quantum information processing to describe noisy dynamics . in particular , the operator - sum representation ( [ kraus ] ) of the above - defined channels is given by the kraus operators , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the superscripts indicate the case we are considering : depolarizing ( d ) , amplitude - damping ( ad ) and phase - damping ( pd ) channels .",
    "a given physical process can be described by multiple kraus representations , as can be seen in the phase - damping channel ( [ eq : phasedampk ] ) , which can also be given by the two kraus operators @xcite @xmath35    traditionally , the term non - markovian master equations denotes non - local equations of the form @xmath36 .",

    "the master equation ( [ eq : nonmarkov ] ) , where the decay rates become negative for some interval of time , is non - markovian . in the following sections we show that the same kraus representations used to described the usual one - qubit noisy channels can be related to many master equations : markovian equations with constant decay rates , markovian equations with time - dependent decay rates , and non - markovian equations .",
    "electronic spins in semiconductor quantum dots have been proposed as a prototype of a scalable quantum computer @xcite .",
    "a caldeira - leggett microscopic model of decoherence , considered to be a generic phenomenological description of the environment of the spins , has also been advanced @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the spin with the collection of harmonic oscillators , which describe its environment , is of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath44-th harmonic oscillator coupled to the @xmath45-th component of the spin .",
    "the interaction is clearly isotropic .",
    "it is also natural to represent the degrees of freedom of the environment as spins , like in spin star models @xmath46 @xcite , where the interaction corresponds to the hyperfine interaction , or to the interaction of the electronic spins with other electronic spins .",
    "repeated application of sum of environmental spins leads to a hilbert space which is a direct sum of `` effective '' spins . here ,",
    "a model closedly related but generally different to the spin star model is considered .",

    "the model given by ( [ eq : hmudepola ] ) corresponds to the spin star model with identical coupling constants if the following conditions are obeyed .",
    "first , @xmath48 ; second , the dimension of the environmental hilbert space is @xmath49 ; and third , the degeneracy of the angular momentum @xmath50 , the number of values of @xmath44 with @xmath51 , is @xcite @xmath52 here , we have taken into account that the eigenvalue of @xmath53 is @xmath54 .    the initial state of the total system is assumed to be factorized @xmath55 , that is , equal to the product of the initial spin state @xmath21 and the initial bath state , @xmath56 .",

    "if the initial state of qubit and environment is @xmath238 , where @xmath239 with @xmath240 , the state at time @xmath149 can be written as @xmath241 the use of schrdinger equation leads to a set of coupled first - order linear equations for the coefficients @xmath242 and @xmath243 . solving the equations for @xmath243 in terms of @xmath244 , and replacing into the equation for @xmath244 we find the integro - differential equation @xmath245 the solution of this equation , which is also obtained for the independent oscillator model @xcite , can be written as @xmath246 , where @xmath247 and @xmath248 are real functions .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the qubit is obtained tracing out the state of the oscillators , @xmath249 , that gives @xmath250 where @xmath251 . a unitary contribution to the dynamics of the qubit",

    "( [ eq : amplitudedampk ] ) to the initial state @xmath255 , one obtains @xmath256 comparing the kraus representation , @xmath257 , with the evolved state of eq .",
    "( [ evolvedstatead ] ) , we conclude that @xmath195 and that the qubit dynamics corresponds to an amplitude damping channel with kraus operators @xmath258",
    ". this amplitude damping channel is , as the noisy channels considered in the previous sections , generally non - markovian and includes cases in which the environment consists of a finite set of oscillators ( even one ) .",
    "one - qubit noisy channels ( depolarizing , dephasing and amplitude - damping channels ) are usually described either by their kraus representations or by lindblad master equations with constant decay rates , the typical markovian master equations . in this paper , simple models for a depolarizing channel",
    "have been considered , and models for dephasing and amplitude damping have been briefly reviewed .",
    "no classical model for the amplitude - damping channel was found , perhaps because the steady state of this channel is a pure state .",
    "the most important point raised in this paper is the following .",
    "the same kraus representation corresponds to different dynamical problems , including markovian master equations with constant decay rates , markovian master equations with time - dependent non - negative decay rates , and non - markovian master equations with temporarily negative decay rates .",
    "this observation may be useful for analyses of quantum information processes in the most promising scalable realizations of quantum processors , which are often non - markovian .",
