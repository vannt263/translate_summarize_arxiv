    "the wavelet analysis has a great many different applications in signal and image processing ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , in physics and astronomy ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also used for developing efficient numerical algorithms for solving differential equations @xcite , @xcite ; however , mother wavelets are usually not associated with the solutions of differential equations under consideration .",
    "there is also an analytic approach to the problems of wave propagation proposed by kaiser @xcite , where the technique of wavelet analysis is developed for the decomposition of solutions of the wave equation in terms of localized solutions , which are called physical wavelets .",
    "they are constructed by means of a special technique of analytic continuation of fundamental solutions in complex space - time and can be split into two parts : an advanced fundamental solution and a retarded one .",
    "the physical wavelet as a localized solution of the wave equation has also been given in @xcite .",
    "applications of physical wavelets were discussed in @xcite-@xcite .    in the present paper , we treat a new wavelet , which is at the same time a localized solution of the homogeneous wave equation in two or more dimensions .",
    "this solution has been previously found and discussed in @xcite , @xcite and generalized in @xcite .",
    "it was named the gaussian wave packet .",
    "we study its properties from two points of view .",
    "first , the solution can be taken as a mother wavelet for continuous wavelet analysis if time is a parameter and can be used in signal processing without being connected with any differential equation .",
    "secondly , this solution should be regarded as a physical wavelet , i.e. , it is an analytic continuation to the complex space - time of the sum of advanced and retarded parts of the field of a point source moving at a speed of wave propagation along a straight line and emitting a pulse that is localized in time .",
    "it is natural to decompose nonstationary wave fields in terms of these solutions , using the techniques of wavelet analysis .",
    "the aim of the paper is a detailed investigation of wavelet properties of the gaussian wave packet for a fixed time and its properties as a solution of the wave equation in view of its further application to problems of wave propagation .",
    "for example , the decomposition of the solution of the initial value problem for the wave equation in terms of wavelets has been proposed by us in @xcite .    in section [ sec - wavan ] ,",
    "we give a brief review of the main facts of continuous wavelet analysis in one and two dimensions .    in section [ sec - twow ] , we show that the gaussian wave packet for a fixed time can be regarded as a wavelet , give some estimates of it , and present its fourier transform . we show that both the wavelet and its fourier transform have an exponential decay at infinity .",
    "the wavelet has not only zero mean but all zero moments as well .    in section [ sec - simplas ]",
    ", we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the gaussian wave packet as some of the free parameters become large .",
    "we compare the packet with the nonstationary gaussian beam @xcite , i.e. , with the solution of the wave equation localized near the axis .",
    "we give the gaussian asymptotic of it reducing it to the morlet well - known wavelet @xcite .    in section [ sec - uncert ]",
    ", we discuss the results of numerical calculations of the centers and widths of the packet in both the space and spatial frequency domains .",
    "we specify how fast these characteristics tend to asymptotic ones , with respect to the morlet wavelet .",
    "we investigate the heisenberg uncertainty relation for this wavelet , depending on the parameters and check how far from the saturation it is .",
    "we also obtain results for the nonasymptotic case where the wavelet corresponds to the solution that describes the propagation of the wave packet of one oscillation .",
    "this case may find applications in optics .",
    "we specify when the wavelet is directional @xcite and calculate its scale and angular resolving powers .",
    "section [ sec - manydim ] gives a generalization of the above results to the case of an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions .    in section [ sec - pulssour ]",
    ", we establish an analogy between the new wavelet and physical wavelets of kaiser @xcite .",
    "we show that it may split into incoming and outgoing parts , each solving a nonhomogeneous wave equation . as a source ,",
    "we take new one - dimensional time - dependent wavelets , moving in the complex space - time at a speed of light .",
    "wavelet analysis is a method for analyzing local spectral properties of functions ( for example , see @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "wavelet analysis also allows one to represent any function of finite energy as the superposition of a family of functions called wavelets derived from one function called a mother wavelet by shifting and scaling its argument in the one - dimensional case and also by rotating it in the case of several spatial dimensions . by analogy ,",
    "the fourier transform represents a signal as the superposition of oscillating exponents derived from one exponent by changing its frequency .",
    "let us give a brief review of some basic facts concerning the wavelet analysis of functions dependent on one variable @xmath0 ( for more detail , see @xcite - @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let a function @xmath1 have a zero mean , and let it decrease as @xmath2 tends to infinity so fast that @xmath3 .",
    "it must oscillate to be nonzero and to have the zero mean .",
    "we call such a function a mother wavelet because we derive a two - parametric family of functions from it , using two operations that shift the argument by @xmath4 and scale it by @xmath5 : @xmath6 thus any function @xmath7 from this family again has the shape of @xmath8 , but shifted and dilated . by means of these operations",
    ", we can place @xmath1 at any point of the @xmath0 axis and change its size to any size by the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "then we define the wavelet transform @xmath9 of any signal @xmath10 by the formula @xmath11 where the bar over @xmath8 denotes complex conjugation .",
    "one of the best - known mother wavelets is the morlet wavelet , which is @xmath12.\\ ] ] it is the difference of a gaussian function , filled with oscillations , and a term that provides the zero mean of @xmath1 and that is negligible if @xmath13 it is clear from formulas ( [ w - family-1d ] ) - ( [ morlet-1d ] ) that @xmath14 , defined by ( [ transform-1d ] ) , provides information about the frequency content of the signal @xmath15 in the vicinity of the size @xmath16 of the point @xmath4 , and @xmath17 plays the role of a spatial frequency .",
    "so we may regard the wavelet transform as a window transform , the size of a window changing for different frequencies . changing the size of the window",
    "makes the wavelet transform more precise as compared to the window fourier ( or gabor ) transform .",
    "we can also reconstruct the signal @xmath10 from its wavelet transform @xmath9 , or , in other words , represent the signal @xmath10 as a superposition of elementary signals @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the mother wavelet used for the reconstruction of @xmath10 may differ from the one used for the analysis .",
    "the reconstruction formula looks like this @xmath18 where @xmath19 is another mother wavelet , and the constant @xmath20 reads @xmath21 where the symbol @xmath22 denotes the fourier transform .",
    "if we use the same wavelet for the transform and reconstruction , we should put @xmath23 and get @xmath24 in this formula to calculate the coefficient @xmath25      wavelet analysis can also be defined for the case of more than one dimension ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
