    "superstring theory provides an exciting superinflationary model @xcite based on a dilaton field interaction with gravity which is free from the common fine tuning of inflationary models because the potential term does not play a crucial role .",
    "the superinflationary cosmological solutions come in duality related pairs , or branches ; the first one describes a superinflationary expansion and the second branch has a decelerated expansion .",
    "the two phases are separated by a singularity .",
    "the graceful exit problem of superinflation @xcite consists in obtaining a smooth transition from the two duality solutions .",
    "it is usually assumed that this transition can only be possible if strong curvature effects are present ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion on this point , and other possibilities ) .",
    "the application of the quantum cosmology approach @xcite to the graceful exit problem seems to be a natural choice as long as the strong curvature regime often provides conditions for quantum cosmological effects @xcite .",
    "one of the main features of quantum cosmology is the possible avoidance of classical singularities due to quantum effects . in order to extract predictions from the wave function of the universe ,",
    "the bohm - de broglie ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite has been proposed @xcite , since it avoids many conceptual difficulties that follow from the application of the standard copenhagen interpretation to a unique system that contains everything . in opposition to the latter one ,",
    "the ontological interpretation does not need a classical domain outside the quantized system to generate the physical facts out of potentialities ( the facts are there _ ab initio _ ) , and hence it can be applied to the universe as a whole .",
    "this interpretation admits the concept of trajectories , called bohmian trajectories , which in the case of cosmology are entire histories of the universe .",
    "these histories satisfy a modified hamilton - jacobi equation , different from the classical one due to the presence of a quantum potential term .",
    "hence , the bohmian trajectories become different from the classical ones when quantum effects become important .",
    "recent investigations @xcite have used this approach to investigate issues of string cosmology , among them , the superinflationary behaviour and the possibility of solving the graceful exit problem .    in the present paper",
    "we will be restricted to the simple case of no dilaton field potential term and friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) geometries with flat spatial sections .",
    "the bohmian trajectories obtained from solutions of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation in jordan s frame can be calculated through suitable conformal transformations @xcite from the bohmian trajectories in einstein s frame , which were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from gaussian superpositions of negative and positive mode solutions of the related wdw equation .",
    "the resulting trajectories present a smooth transition from the classical inflationary pre - big bang epoch to the usual classical pos - big - bang decelerated phase .",

    "the graceful exit transition from the superinflation pre - big bang epoch to the usual decelerated expansion phase is exhibited .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "the so called superinflation is a superstring cosmology duality - pair solution in the low energy effective field theory context .",
    "the relevant terms can be shown in the following lagrangian in the jordan frame ( with non - minimal coupling between gravity and the free scalar field ) : @xmath0 this lagrangian appears in effective string theory without the kalb - ramond field when @xmath1 , the usual dilaton field potential @xmath2 not being considered in this paper . through a conformal transformation @xmath3 , we can obtain the lagrangian in the einstein frame ( with minimal coupling ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 . to compare with the classical trajectories obtained in ref .",

    "the @xmath16 branch , valid when @xmath17 , reads @xmath18 and describes accelerated expansion in the case @xmath19 , i.e. , inflationary evolution .    for @xmath20 , the @xmath21 branch solution seems to be almost the same , @xmath22 but now describes decelerated expansion in the case @xmath23 , which can be connected smoothly to a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) decelerated expansion .",
    "the transition from an inflationary expanding universe to a frw expanding one , or graceful exit from inflation , will be obtained here by means of quantum bohmian trajectories .",
    "these trajectories are better described using the coordinate @xmath24 , so that the @xmath16 branch ( [ hplus])([phiplus ] ) in the @xmath25 case , gives @xmath26 while the @xmath21 branch ( [ hminus])([phiminus ] ) , also in the @xmath25 case , yields @xmath27    hence , the classical trajectories in the plane @xmath28 are straight lines with different slopes depending on the type of branch , and both have singularities for @xmath29 .",

    ", we applied a conformal transformation to obtain in a straightforward way the bohmian trajectories in the jordan frame corresponding to universe histories in string cosmology .",
    "we exhibited a class of trajectories representing universe evolutions with graceful exit .",
    "they start classically from inflationary behaviour driven by kinetic terms , as it is usual in these cases .",
    "when curvature becomes relevant , quantum effects become important avoiding the singularity and creating a smooth transition to the usual classical decelerated expansion .",
    "the results of this paper should be contrasted with results obtained using other interpretations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of the many worlds interpretation",
    ", the construction of a hilbert space is very important in order to define a probability measure .",
    "however , for scalar field minisuperspaces , the wheeler - dewitt equation has a klein - gordon structure and it is well known that it is hard to construct a unique positive definite measure with such equations .",
    "the common way out from these problems is to take semiclassical approximations .",
    "this problem is intimately connected with the problem of time @xcite .",
    "once we do not have an extrinsic time , the wheeler - dewitt equation can not be transformed into a schroedinger like equation , and hence all these problems with its hyperbolic signature appear , unless one makes use of a semiclassical approximation as it is done in ref .",
    "however , the graceful exit shall occur when quantum effects are important , where a semiclassical approximation breaks down , rendering problematic the analysis of this transition in the many worlds interpretation . in the bohm - de broglie interpretation , probability measures are not essential .",
    "we can talk about quantum trajectories , and probabilities are relevant only for settling reasonable initial conditions on such trajectories .",
    "the notion of quantum trajectories is well defined even for klein - gordon like wheeler - dewitt equations .",
    "the scale factor and scalar field follow real trajectories which satisfy modified einstein s equations ammended with a quantum potential term .",
    "the concept of spacetime is as meaningfull in the bohm - de broglie interpretation of minisuperspace quantum cosmology as it is in classical general relativity ( gr ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion on this point , and @xcite for the different case of midisuperspace models and the full superspace ) .",
    "the only difference is that the dynamics may be changed by the presence of the quantum potential . as in classical minisuperspace gr ,",
    "the dynamics is invariant under time reparametrizations , even in the presence of the quantum potential .",
    "hence , the symbol @xmath38 in the bohmian trajectories is an arbitrary parameter like in gr , which can be fixed by a choice of the lapse function , without physical modifications of the dynamics of spacetime .",
    "that is how it is possible , in this interpretation , to talk about a graceful exit transition when the curvature of spacetime increases .",
    "we have only to examine the behaviour of the bohmian trajectories in such regions .",
    "note that in the region of configuration space where a semiclassical description can be applied in the framework of the many worlds interpretation , there is accordance of results : the semiclassical wave function is peaked along the classical trajectories @xcite , which are exactly the bohmian trajectories in that region .",
    "the conclusion is that , as the bohm - de broglie interpretation has more concepts then the many worlds interpretation , the former can be used in situations where the application of the latter is problematic .",
    "our results come in this way . of course it would be desirable to define a probability measure on the bohmian trajectories coming from the wave function ( [ onda ] ) , which could be valid in all minisuperspace , as long as not all of them describe the pre - big bang model with graceful exit , although all bohmian trajectories with initial conditions imposing an initial superinflationary pre - big bang phase present a graceful exit to the decelerated regime .",
    "if this is possible , one should expect that the statistical predictions of the many worlds interpretation are identical to the statistical predictions of the bohm - de broglie interpretation .",
    "the above considerations raise doubts on the physical equivalence of these two interpretations in quantum cosmology . due to the singular features present in the quantization of the whole universe",
    ", it is possible that one of them presents more physical relevant and testable information then the other in this particular field ( which is not the case , up to now , in quantum field theory and non relativistic quantum mechanics ) .",
    "this suggests that quantum cosmology may be the arena where it could be possible to distinguish physically between these two interpretations .",
    "this is a strong motivation to push forward these two interpretations up to their limits in all possible aspects of quantum cosmology and compare their results in order to obtain a relevant physical distinction , or even some observable prediction , which could select one of them as the valid interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "a logical future generalization of the present work is to study dilaton field potential terms so that the decelerated expansion can be joined smoothly to an ordinary frw radiation dominated expanding universe @xcite .",
    "it is also important to check how these results depend on initial conditions on the wdw equation .",
