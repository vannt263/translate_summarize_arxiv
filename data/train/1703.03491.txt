    "the same equation has been applied in other frameworks too , see _",
    "e.g _ , @xcite .",
    "the cubic - quintic equation is an appropriate model for the propagation of light in certain optical materials , see for instance @xcite and references in @xcite .",
    "it has also been used as an approximation to the process of filamentation @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances reinforce the significance of new theoretical studies . despite damping , ( limited )",
    "soliton propagation has been observed in carbon disulfide @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the droplet - like behavior of cubic - quintic propagation has been demonstrated in atomic gases at low optical powers @xcite , using quantum coherence and interference as proposed in @xcite .",

    ". confinement and guiding of light in a ( defocusing ) cubic- ( focusing ) quintic has also been reported @xcite .    in the cubic - quintic model",
    ", there is a one - parameter family of form - preserving traveling dark wave solutions within a critical bright background , which was computed in @xcite following the numerical methods of @xcite . for small velocities ,",
    "it consists of vortex - antivortex pairs of charges @xmath0 ( we will make a usual abuse of language and refer to `` velocity '' for what in the optical setup corresponds to the propagation angle with respect to the axis ) . for larger subsonic velocities ,",
    "the solutions are rarefaction pulses , namely dark blobs without vorticity .",
    "the fainter the pulse is , the faster it moves within the bright background .",
    "this family of solutions is similar to the one existing for third order defocusing nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "rarefaction pulses should not be confused with the unstable quiescent bubbles of @xcite .",
    "a separate issue is how these dark soliton - like excitations can be generated dynamically . in the context of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , they have been generated by phase imprinting @xcite . in the framework of superfluids , it was shown that they can appear when the fluid flows past an obstacle @xcite , a process that in optics can be mimicked by the nonlinear interaction with an incoherently coupled beam @xcite and in becs with a laser beam ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a remarkable result of @xcite is that , for the liquid of light , rarefaction pulses can be generated by interference in the collision of two bright solitons of very different sizes and powers .",
    "the analogy with bubbles in fluids motivates the usage of the term cavitation for this kind of process .",
    "the produced caviton excitation propagates within the large soliton and can exit it becoming a bright soliton again .",

    "this limit is the liquid - like phase , in which the soliton resembles a fluid with constant density and fixed surface tension subject to the young - laplace equation @xcite .",
    "we will use these bright solitons to define the initial conditions of simulations in the following sections , by considering : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are the initial positions of the solitons , @xmath23 their initial velocities and @xmath24 their initial phases .",

    "when @xmath32 grows , the vortex and antivortex merge into a rarefaction pulse , whose @xmath40 is nowhere vanishing .",
    "it is important to remark that the transition is completely smooth and , roughly , one can think of the rarefaction pulse as a bound state of vortex and antivortex .",

    "the analyisis in the coming sections results from the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ cqeq ] ) with initial conditions ( [ init ] ) .",
    "the computations are done using a standard split - step beam propagation method @xcite .",
    "the evolution associated to the non - derivative terms is computed with a fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "the plotted figures are built using grids of 800@xmath47600 points .",
    "we have checked convergence of the method by comparing results with different grids in @xmath48 and steps in @xmath49 .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that a rarefaction pulse can appear when two coherent bright solitons meet with appropriate relative velocity and phase . roughly speaking ,",
    "destructive interference generates a void at the collision point which can acquire the necessary velocity thanks to the incoming momentum .",
    "although , definitely , an exact solution of ( [ eqtravel ] ) is not realized in the dynamical process , the resulting robust dark excitation can indeed be identified with a traveling wave solution .",
    "this fact was checked in @xcite by comparing the dispersion relations .",
    "even if the size of the medium ( the large soliton ) is not infinite , it can support the traveling wave if it is much larger than the dark structure .    in this section ,",
    "we show that a similar process can result in the formation of a vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "in fact , the difference with @xcite is simply that the incomnig soliton has to be larger .",
    "what happens is that during a collision in phase opposition , an elongated dark region is created .",
    "it can not be stable because there are no rarefaction pulse solutions of similar size .",
    "consequently , it evolves and decays through a snake instability giving rise to the separate vortex and antivortex , which move forward together with a given velocity @xmath32 .",
    "since the resulting configuration is not exactly equal to the stationary solution , the dark regions can change , reconnect and split again . however the vortex - antivortex profile becomes apparent after long enough propagation in @xmath49 .",

    "when it does so as a vortex - antivortex pair , two waves propagating in opposite directions along the edge of the large soliton get excited @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that the generation of vortex and antivortex is only one of the possible qualitative outcomes that emerge depending on the relative velocity and phase . as in @xcite",
    ", the droplets can simply coalesce into one .",
    "the collision can also result in rarefaction pulses of different energies and speeds . for low velocities , part of the energy can bounce back evolving into a smaller bright soliton . in all cases ,",
    "surface and bulk sound waves are excited during the process .",
    "if the collision is very violent , the large soliton can be severely distorted , ceasing to be a liquid - like approximately homogeneous medium .",
    "we close this section by noting that there are vortex solutions of the cubic - quintic equation ( [ cqeq ] ) of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the topological charge and @xmath60 is the polar angle .",
    "their profiles and stability have been studied in @xcite and their collisional dynamics in @xcite .",
    "we remark that the vortices that we are studying in this paper as solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqtravel ] ) are different objects : they live within the vorticity - less liquid of light and they only exist in pairs and moving with a finite velocity .",
    "let us start illustrating the interactions by computing the head - on encounter of two vortex pairs created as described in section iii .",
    "a typical example is displayed in fig .",
    "the result is an exchange in which the vortex of each pair recombines with the antivortex of the other one ( the exchange of a single vortex with a vortex - antivortex pair was described in @xcite with cubic nonlinear potential . )",
    "the solitary waves come out perpendicular to the incoming direction .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the flow lines of eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) , considering that , during the approach , each pair generates a smooth inhomogeneity in the background in which the other one propagates @xcite . for instance",
    ", the antivortex on the top right ( see the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig . [ fig5 ] ) feels the flow lines generated by the phase structure of the vortex on the top left ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and is pushed upwards .",
    "conversely , the vortex in the bottom right turns downwards because of the antivortex in the bottom left .",
    "since these bends tend to associate again vortex and antivortex , the propagation can continue after the exchange . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we have considered slightly different phases for the initial solitons in order to show that a perfect symmetry is not needed for this process .     with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",

    "color code and axes are defined as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]",
    "similar exchanges can happen for collisions at angles .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] depicts an example where the incoming excitations are perpendicular to each other . in this case , the vortex moving downwards and the antivortex moving leftwards attract each other and coalesce into a dark blob which can be considered an excited version of a rarefaction pulse .",
    "it comes out heading the top right of the plot and is finally reconverted into a ( highly excited ) bright soliton when it reaches the edge of the medium .",
    "the remaining vortex and antivortex eventually couple to each other and continue to propagate towards the bottom left .",
    "notice that the velocity of this pair is much lower than that of the aforementioned rarefaction pulse , as expected from the stationary solutions characterized in section ii .     with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "the range of the axes is @xmath71 $ ] . ]",
    "the simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is also interesting because it shows other generic features of the dynamics , which can be better appreciated in the animation presented in the supplemental material @xcite . in particular",
    ", we must emphasize that the evolution of the dark excitations is not elastic , in the sense that some energy is radiated away in the form of sound waves .",
    "moreover , faint rarefaction pulses , of small energy regarding eq .",
    "( [ pe2 ] ) , can be generated .",
    "these radiation processes take place during collisions and also during the relaxation of the coherently generated dark bubbles towards their stationary vortex pair form .",
    "we also remark that , for encounters like that of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , small changes in the initial conditions can determine how the dark regions combine and greatly affect the outcoming pulses .",
    "for instance , if we just change @xmath72 from ( -0.2,0 ) to ( -0.21,0 ) , therefore breaking the symmetry , between both incoming vortex pairs , the one moving horizontally arrives first . instead of performing a exchange with the other vortex",
    ", it merges with the antivortex , creating an elongated void of net vorticity -1 .",
    "this snake - like structure starts rotating and eventually decays emitting a rarefaction pulse .",
    "we present this evolution in @xcite .",
    "thus , the encounter gives rise to a vortex - antivortex pair and a rarefaction pulse , just as in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , but their resulting propagation directions are rather different .",
    "this simulation also shows that , when there is an eventual dark - bright reconversion , the outgoing dark soliton does not necessarily come out with the same propagation direction as the dark blob which generates it .",
    "we close this section by considering a head - on encounter in which the vortices of each pair meet each other ( instead of heading an antivortex as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . this can be accomplished by slightly shifting the @xmath73-position of the bright solitons defined in the initial conditions .",
    "an example is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    ) with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath50 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the large soliton is the one with @xmath52 and the smaller ones have @xmath65 .",
    "color code and axes range are defined as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]",
    "this evolution can be qualitatively understood noting that the vortices repel each other and therefore are slowed down while the antivortices continue advancing .",
    "this induces a rotation of the whole dark structure , which eventually breaks down resulting in two separate pulses which come out at an angle , different from the incoming one .",
    "this is a kind of pseudo - elastic collision .",
    "notice , however , that the scattered pulses can not be neatly considered vortex - antivortex as the incoming ones .",
    "vortex pairs and rarefaction pulses can be cleanly defined for stationary situations but in dynamical evolutions like the present one , the separation between both is not obvious and they can even transform into each other , as noticed in @xcite in a different but somewhat related scenario .",
    "we now consider the encounter of a rarefaction pulse with a vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "an illustrative case is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . in the example",
    ", the dark regions moving in opposite directions pass near each other but do not experience a direct contact .",
    "they keep their distinct identities during the whole evolution and therefore this process is very similar to a elastic scattering .",
    "the pulses continue their propagation away from each other and therefore we call this a flyby mode , following @xcite . in the figure , it can be appreciated that the propagation of the rarefaction pulse is rotated by a small angle when both waves meet ( the horizontal dashed line has been included in the plots to guide the eye ) .",
    "again , this is due to the flow lines defined in eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) and represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , whose structure explains why the caviton turns upwards .",
    "the vortex - antivortex pair is also affected by the encounter , by since its energy and momentum ( [ pe2 ] ) is quite larger that that of the rarefaction pulse , it is much harder to appreciate the diversion .",
    "notice that this flyby mode is only relevant for a narrow window of the scattering impact parameter .",
    "if the caviton pulse moves far from the dipolar structure , the phase gradients are tiny and their effect is negligible . on the other hand , if both waves are too near , the dark regions recombine giving rise to more complicated evolutions , as we show in the next example .    , the path that the rarefaction pulse would follow in the absence of other excitations .",
    "initial conditions are defined by eq .",
    "( [ init ] ) with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath50 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",

    ", the dark regions associated to the antivortex and the rarefaction pulse come into contact and merge , initially giving rise to a large blob of vorticity -1 .",
    "since the vortex - antivortex pair has the larger momentum and energy , the subsequent evolution can be roughly described as an absorption of the rarefaction pulse by the pair , which becomes highly excited , but continues its propagation rigthwards .",
    "this structure slowly relaxes towards the stationary vortex - antivortex solution by the emission of sound waves and faint rarefaction pulses @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "we also present a simulation in which the vortex pair and the caviton approach each other with zero impact parameter .",
    "roughly , the dynamics can be understood in terms of the previous discussion : when the dark regions touch each other , the rarefaction pulse is swallowed by the vortex - antivortex which , albeit excited , continues its propagation .",

    "let us now discuss the case of two interacting rarefaction pulses . first of all , we notice the existence of flyby modes , similar to those described in the previous section , when the impact parameter is not too large but enough to avoid direct contact .",
    "it is also worth commenting on the dynamics of head - on collisions .",
    "the most common result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "when the pulses meet , a larger dark blob is created with , possibly , a bright spot inside ( see panel ( d ) of fig . [ fig10 ] . )",
    "then , two rarefaction pulses appear again and continue their propagation . during the encounter ,",

    "thus , in this respect , the rarefaction pulses behave as dark quasi - solitons .",
    "we remark that this happens for symmetric encounters as the one of the figure or asymmetric ones with pulses of different energies .",
    "as expected , when the cavitons reach the edge of the large soliton , they can be reconverted in bright solitons again .",

    "however , in this case this blob can survive and , in a loose sense , propagate in the direction required by momentum conservation .",
    "thus , the simulation of fig . [ fig12 ] can be neatly portrayed as the merging of two rarefaction pulses into a more energetic one .",

    "we close the section by noticing that there is a second typical qualitative behavior , which we show in the last animation of @xcite .",

    "in this work , we have numerically analyzed eq .",
    "( [ cqeq ] ) , reporting on a number of novel qualitative phenomena for the cubic - quintic model in 1 + 2 dimensions .",
    "the interplay of diffraction with focusing and defocusing nonlinear effects endows the cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation with an extremely rich phenomenology .",
    "in particular , there are dark traveling waves and bright solitons , which for large powers become liquid - like .",
    "noticeably , the dark and bright stationary and stable solitary waves can transform into each other during evolution .",
    "in particular , a bright soliton can excite a rarefaction pulse when it meets a bright soliton of larger power @xcite .",

    "the incoming soliton has to be larger and gives rise to a more pronounced distortion of the flat - top soliton .",
    "moreover , the vortex and antivortex are not generated directly , but only as the end result of a snake instability of an initial dark blob .",

    "nevertheless , if we only take into account the dark traveling waves , the conservation breaks down , as it obvious from figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "the main reason is that sound waves take a sizable fraction of energy and momentum in many processes .",
    "moreover , as we have already emphasized , the dark waves typically appear in excited form and therefore the velocity - momentum and dispersion relations that can be deduced from the stationary solutions only apply approximately .",
    "excited dark states have complicated dynamics and can not always be easily identified with their stationary counterparts .",
    "thus , the quasiparticle interpretation is illustrative but it should be clear that it is just a qualitative rough description .",
    "our results open some interesting possibilities .",
    "first of all , it would be nice to realize the described phenomena in optical setups along the lines of @xcite",
    ". it would also be desirable to study similar effects in two dimensions for the cubic defocusing nonlinearity , since it is relevant for bose - einstein experiments like @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , it would be worth considering the three dimensional cubic - quintic case , which supports top - flat stable spatiotemporal solitons @xcite and vortices @xcite .",
    "their collsional dynamics has been analyzed in @xcite but the dynamics of dark traveling waves has not been described yet . using the cubic defocusing schrdinger equation ,",
    "interesting dynamical analysis of the interplay of rarefaction pulses , vortex rings and vortex lines in 1 + 3 dimensions have been presented in the context of bose - einstein condensates @xcite and superfluids @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to make contact with these analyses in the cubic - quintic case .",
    "finally , we remark that our setup has partial similarities with other physical systems as , _",
    "e.g. _ , the scattering by impurities in superfluids as recently modeled in @xcite",
    ". it could be worth exploring analogies between different frameworks .",
