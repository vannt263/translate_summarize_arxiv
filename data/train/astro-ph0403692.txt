    "the _ egret _  telescope on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) satellite has detected 271 sources in a survey of the @xmath3-ray (  100 mev to 10 gev ) sky .",
    "roughly one quarter of these have previously been identified as blazars @xcite .",
    "recently , we have developed a new counterpart identification technique , which has pushed the identified fraction to @xmath270% in the northern hemisphere ( sowards - emmerd _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 2003 , hereafter srm03 ) . here",
    ", we extend the application of this technique south ( -40@xmath1 @xmath4 decl .",
    "@xmath4 0@xmath1 ) , including the galactic bulge region .",
    "in order to rank blazar candidates in this zone using our ` figure of merit ' ( fom ) method , we have selected flat spectrum radio counterpart candidates in 3eg source error boxes .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopic confirmations and estimated redshifts for many of these candidate blazars with the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) marcario low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) and with the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope igi spectrograph at mcdonald observatory . for our final counterpart list",
    ", we used the vla to obtain compact 8.4 ghz fluxes similar to those previously mined from the class ( meyers _ et  al .",
    "_ 2002 ) survey .",
    "this allows a robust selection of egret blazar - like counterparts and a statistical measure of the identification probability of each source .",
    "the blazar label is somewhat heterogeneous , but in the context of the unified agn model , these sources are believed to be viewed close to the axis of a powerful relativistic jet . as such they are compact flat spectrum radio sources , with apparent superluminal motion at vlbi scales .",
    "the optical counterparts exhibit significant polarization and ovv ( optically violently variable ) behavior @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy yields a dichotomy of sources : flat spectrum radio quasars with broad emission lines and continuum - dominated bl lac - type objects showing weak absorption features and occasionally narrow , weak emission lines . the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is sometimes used to divide these into two classes , with ` red ' blazars showing a synchrotron peak in the ir - optical with a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) peak in the @xmath3-ray while ` blue ' blazars have a synchrotron component extending into the x - ray with a ssc peak inferred to extend to the tev range ( urry 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "in our previous analysis ( srm03 ) , we quantified the correlation between flat spectrum radio sources and 3eg positions .",
    "this approach produces a quantitative evaluation of the likelihood of each counterpart candidate , based on radio flux , radio spectral index , x - ray flux , and location of the source within a 3eg error box .",
    "the independent functions used to generate this ` figure of merit ' ( fom ) statistic took the form of a fractional excess of sources found within the 3eg positional 95% confidence contours , in a given flux or spectral index bin , relative to the random background sources : @xmath5 these functions , combined with the positional likelihood @xmath6 , form our fom : @xmath7 the details of the fom analysis are described in srm03 .",
    "here it is worth noting that the adopted fitting functions take the radio fom to zero at @xmath8 85 mjy and the spectral index fom to zero at @xmath90.53 , where @xmath10 .    to generate a fom for southern / bulge sources equivalent to those of the northern sample , accurate ,",
    "compact 8.4 ghz fluxes were essential .",
    "source selection for 8.4 ghz vla a - array observations proceeded in a similar fashion to that for the class survey .",
    "we first selected nvss ( 1.4 ghz ; condon _ et  al .",
    "_ 1998 ) sources within 90 arcseconds of pmn ( 4.85 ghz ; gregory _ et  al .  _ 1996 ) single dish source positions , for pmn sources in the ts maps of 3eg catalog sources in the range -40@xmath1 @xmath4 decl .",
    "@xmath4 0@xmath1 .",
    "the ` test statistic ' ts is the maximum likelihood estimator used in the egret source catalogs to quantify the probability that an egret point source is at a given location ; contours of @xmath11ts from the maximum define the source uncertainty region . for each 1.4  ghz source",
    "a spectral index was computed ; if multiple nvss sources matched one pmn source , the nvss fluxes were summed and the average 1.4/4.8 ghz spectral index was applied to each .",
    "sources with spectral indices steeper than 0.5 , the class spectral index cut , were dropped from consideration .",
    "additionally , a conservative spectral index lower limit of -2.0 was applied .",
    "such strongly inverted spectral indices are consistent with optically thick thermal emission and we expect these sources to be galactic ( planetary nebulae and hii regions ) .",
    "blazars generally do not exhibit spectra nearly this inverted .",
    "the class blazar survey @xcite contains 6 sources ( of 325 ) with @xmath12 and only one of these has been optically identified as a blazar .",
    "the deep x - ray blazar survey @xcite find only 2 sources ( of 298 ) with @xmath13 and none with @xmath12 .    using these spectral indices",
    ", we then computed preliminary 8.4  ghz flux estimates .",
    "x - ray fluxes were mined from the rosat all - sky survey bright and faint catalogs . from the estimated 8.4 ghz flux , the spectral index , the x - ray flux , and the @xmath11ts at the position of the radio source , the fom was calculated .",
    "sources located at values of @xmath11ts @xmath14 13.5 were not considered .",
    "we have made a conservative cut of fom @xmath14 0.125 , half the threshold for inclusion as plausible identifications in srm03 , to allow for errors in the spectral index and the flux extrapolation to 8.4 ghz .",
    "blazars are significantly variable and our radio survey observations are not simultaneous , so it is important to note this is a significant source of error in the spectral index estimates .",
    "source confusion in the large pmn beam and measurement uncertainties for the fainter sources may also contribute .",
    "pmn observations were made in 1990 , while the nvss observations spanned 1993 - 1996 .",
    "sources meeting this preliminary fom @xmath14 0.125 criterion were targeted for vla 8.4 ghz follow - up .",
    "class 8.4 ghz fluxes are in general not available below decl.@xmath15 .",
    "thus , to establish a spectral index and flux for the sources equivalent to that used in srm03 , sources above the preliminary fom threshold were observed at 8.4 ghz with the vla a - array during 23 - 25 july 2003 ( program ar517 ) .",
    "observations were taken with a bandwidth of 50 mhz in each if and typically two 2 - 3 minute scans were taken per source . in practice , a number of targets in the original candidate list were not observed in this campaign .",
    "a handful of egret error boxes at low latitude contained very large numbers of sources , likely due to extended galactic emission .",
    "these were not observed , although a number of the candidates in these regions formally met our 1.4 ghz/4.85 ghz survey cuts . at higher latitude",
    "a few additional sources were missed due to clerical error . in the analysis that follows we use the 1.4/4.85 spectral indices and extrapolated fluxes for these objects .",
    "several of these sources are very likely to be thermal , but a few deserve interferometric follow up and our classification of these should be viewed as preliminary .",
    "archival 8.4 ghz fluxes were mined from the vla calibrator database for several of the brightest sources .",
    "several of the target sources were in fact used as vla phase calibrators during the observation run .",
    "a total of 102 sources were observed in this campaign .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated with the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package in the usual manner .",
    "maps were created , self - calibrated and cleaned using aips .",
    "a single - component model was employed in the self - calibration .",
    "self - calibration was not performed on a handful of the faintest ( few mjy ) sources . finally , peak intensities of the sources were fit .",
    "all of the bright sources were strongly core dominated , although about 20% show jets on 0.1 - 1 arcsec scales , consistent with the blazar classification .",
    "the typical noise level was less than 1 mjy / beam .",
    "except for the faintest sources , the flux errors are dominated by calibration uncertainties at these low declinations ( estimated at @xmath23% ) .",
    "fluxes of sources that meet our fom threshold appear in table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the images for our highest probability new identifications .",
    "precise positions and core fluxes for all observed sources are in table 4 . the remainder of the images will be provided upon request .",
    "several sources showed no compact flux , and a handful gave fluxes much lower than expected from our extrapolated values . indeed all but one of the sources with @xmath16 - 0.8 had little compact 8.4 ghz flux .",
    "several of these sources can be identified as extended hii regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "based on this result , we believe that the sources classified as ( g ) in table 1 are in fact galactic .",
    "we note that many of these objects have spectral indices consistent with an optically thick thermal spectrum , @xmath17 however , as halpern _ et  al .  _",
    "( 2001 ) have pointed out , blazars at low latitude can be masked in the radio by galactic objects , as in the case of 3eg j2016 + 3657 .",
    "to be conservative , we denote these as unclassified sources in our summary aitoff plot .",
    "it should be noted that 1.4 - 8.4 ghz spectral indices are generally steeper than 1.4 - 4.8 ghz spectral indices based on the pmn fluxes .",
    "this is also seen in the class blazar survey @xcite .",
    "the majority of our radio selected blazar candidates have archival optical classifications and redshifts .",
    "information for these objects were extracted from the simbad and ned databases .",
    "we have targeted the remainder of the sources for spectroscopic followup at mcdonald observatory .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained using the marcario lrs ( hill et al .",
    "1998 ) on the 9.2 m het ( ramsey et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these targets were observed in regular queue operations between april 2003 and july 2003 .",
    "we obtained 2 @xmath18 300s exposures for most targets , and 3 @xmath18 300s for fainter targets .",
    "observations were made employing a 300 line mm@xmath19 grating and a 2@xmath20 slit , giving a dispersion of 4  per ( binned ) pixel and an effective resolution of 16  covering @xmath21 .",
    "due to the pointing limitations of the het ( decl .",
    "-11@xmath1 ) , the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory was used to observe southern targets below this limit .",
    "observations were made during one observing run from 25 - 29 july 2003 .",
    "the imaging grism instrument ( igi ) spectrograph was used with a 6000  grism , and a 50 mm lens .",
    "a 2@xmath20 slit was employed for the first 1.5 nights , and a 2.5@xmath20 slit thereafter due to generally poor seeing .",
    "the image fwhm fluctuated between 1.5@xmath20 and 2@xmath20 on the best night , but typically held around 2 - 2.5@xmath20 .",
    "the igi setup covered a smaller wavelength range than the het / lrs , namely @xmath23 . due to a wide range of conditions and source brightnesses , total exposures ranged from 300 to 3600 seconds .",
    "standard ccd reductions were performed using iraf .",
    "spectra were optimally extracted from the 2-d images and calibrated .",
    "telluric corrections were applied to remove atmospheric absorption .",
    "redshifts were estimated by cross - correlation analysis with agn and galaxy spectral templates , using the iraf rvsao package .    as of this publication , we have obtained 26 spectral classifications , 8 with the het / lrs and 18 with the mcdonald 2.7m / igi .",
    "the new redshifts and basic optical properties of these objects are listed in table 2 .",
    "marginal ( e.g. single line or low s / n ) redshift estimates are denoted by a colon .",
    "spectra taken at mcdonald observatory are plotted in figure 2 . since",
    "optical observations were initiated before the 8.4 ghz data were reduced , a number of sources in figure 2 and table 2 do not appear in table 1 , as their final fom are below the ` plausible ' threshold .",
    "sources observed at mcdonald observatory were classified based on their spectra , s / n permitting .",
    "the observed sources fall into the following 3 categories : bl lac objects ( bll ) , flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , and narrow line radio galaxies ( nlrg ) . bl lac objects",
    "are defined here by the following properties ( marcha et al .",

    "these objects generally exhibit a weak continuum flux , and were consequently classified as nlrgs .",
    "the majority of observed sources were fsrqs with broad ( v@xmath27 1000 - 2000 km / s ) emission lines .",
    "for the sources with archival redshifts , we examined spectra from the literature whenever possible . when these were unavailable the ned / simbad classifications were adopted as a last resort .",
    "all of the 3eg error boxes located in the region -40@xmath1 @xmath4 decl .",
    "@xmath4 0@xmath1 are listed in table 1 , along with classifications and new counterpart candidates .",
    "we recover many of the counterparts identified in the third egret catalog @xcite and by mattox @xcite .",
    "those that did not meet our selection criteria are included for completeness ( italics ) . we also indicate in the classification column sources that are previously discussed pulsar / plerion candidates ( p ) .",
    "the spectral index listed in the table is calculated between 1.4 ghz and 8.4 ghz , where @xmath10 , with the exception of indices listed in parentheses which were calculated between 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz .",
    "a radio i d flag , rid , was included to indicate the origin of the radio flux : the vla calibrator survey , this campaign , or both .",
    "sources are divided into high and lower confidence identifications by their foms .",
    "lower confidence ( ` plausible ' ) identifications fall in the range 0.25 @xmath4fom@xmath4 1.0 , and higher confidence ( ` likely ' ) source identifications have fom @xmath28 1 . in the -40@xmath1 @xmath4 decl .",
    "@xmath4 0@xmath1 band we have identified 30 likely and 23 plausible counterparts with 8.4 ghz flux measurements ( 5 nominally ` likely ' counterparts lacking 8.4 ghz confirmation deserve follow - up , but as noted above the 28 additional sources classified as ` plausible ' based on extrapolated fluxes are mostly at low @xmath29 , are very likely galactic , and are designated ` g ' in table 1 ) . despite the rather cautious labels , the sources with 8.4 ghz observations are statistically highly significant identifications ; simulations based on the northern survey indicate a success rate of 92% for the likely sources and 82% for the plausible sources . thus among ` likely ' sources with 8.4  ghz measurements ( of which 7 are newly identified here ) we statistically expect 2 false positives . for the ` plausible ' sources ( 16 of which are new ) we expect no more than 4 false identifications .    as in the north , we find evidence in this southern extension for multiple counterparts for individual 3eg sources , where the fainter radio counterpart(s ) would be ignored in the 3eg / mattox studies .",
    "figure 3 shows two cases , 3eg j1246 - 0651 and 3eg j1911 - 2000 .",
    "3eg j1246 - 0651 contains two high - confidence ids in an elongated error region , with two likelihood maxima corresponding well to the candidate positions .",
    "3eg j1911 - 2000 also contains two counterparts , one plausible and one high - confidence .",
    "again , the sources line up along the major axis of the error contour .",
    "it appears that the centroid of the uncertainty region is shifted slightly from the more likely source toward the fainter radio source , suggesting that a fainter @xmath3-ray contribution biases the ts localization .",
    "a comparison of the populations and luminosity functions of the candidates requires full treatment of the egret sensitivities and the radio / x - ray selection biases .",
    "we defer this population study to a future communication .",
    "however , it is already interesting to make a comparison of the areal densities of various source classes in the combined survey .",
    "the galactic aitoff projection in figure 4 summarizes the current status of the 3eg counterpart identification . in order to compare the different populations , we divide the sky above decl .",
    "@xmath14 -40@xmath1 into three regions : +  galactic plane",

    "even relative to this increase , there is clearly an excess of non - blazar identifications in the bulge ( 54% _ vs. _ 32% at high latitude ) , which likely represents a new bulge population of @xmath0ray sources . within the plane",
    ", we find 12 blazar ids and 49 non - blazar ids , compared to 18 blazar ids and 8 non - blazars predicted from high latitude .",
    "the apparent deficit of blazar identifications in the plane may be partly due to decreased egret sensitivity in this high background region , although source confusion limitations to counterpart identification may also play a role .",
    "the large number of unidentified sources here clearly represents a galactic population .    grouping objects by type",
    ", we find 17% bl lacs and 83% fsrqs in the southern extension , very similar to the 19% bl lacs and 81% fsrqs in the northern survey .",
    "we can examine the redshift distributions of the northern and southern extension samples , since these should be independent of the initial candidate selection .",
    "before we do so , we include four additional redshifts determined for the northern sample since the publication of srm03 ( figure 5 , table 3 ) .",
    "since the bl lacs and fsrqs form two distinct populations in redshift space , we treat the two samples independently ( figure 6 ) .",
    "similar to the northern sample , we uncover a handful of @xmath33 sources in the southern extension .",
    "for the fsrq sample , we find a good agreement between the north and south , with a kolmogorov - smirnov probability of 0.27 that the populations are drawn from the same parent distribution . in the case of bl lacs ,",
    "the north and south distributions are still consistent , but with a lower probability  prob(k - s ) = 0.08 .",
