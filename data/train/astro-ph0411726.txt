    "the binary pulsar system j0737 - 3039 consists of a millisecond pulsar ( pulsar a with a period @xmath6 ms ) and a normal pulsar ( pulsar b with @xmath7 s ) in a @xmath8 hr orbit with eccentricity @xmath9 ( burgay 2003 ) .",
    "the system has a nearly edge - on orientation with respect to our line of sight , leading to a brief ( about @xmath10  s ) eclipse of pulsar a by the magnetosphere of pulsar b during each orbit at a s superior conjunction ( lyne 2004 ; kaspi 2004 ; mclaughlin 2004 ) .",
    "the depth of the eclipse is quite significant , corresponding to an absorption optical depth of order a few ( kaspi 2004 ) .",
    "the eclipse is asymmetric : it is deeper and longer after the conjunction , indicating that the optical depth increases from the eclipse ingress to egress .",
    "timing observation ( including measurement of shapiro delay ) provided the first determination of the system s inclination angle with respect to our line of sight , @xmath11 ( lyne 2004 ) .",
    "recently , coles ( 2004 ) have used the correlation of the interstellar scintillations of both pulsars to obtain a remarkable constraint on the minimum distance between a and b on the plane of the sky , @xmath12  km , corresponding to @xmath13 . as we show in this _ letter _",
    ", such a small projected separation of a and b gives rise to interesting gravitational lensing effects during each orbit .",
    "at the superior conjunction of pulsar a , the distance between a and b projected to our line of sight is @xmath14 , where @xmath15  km is the semimajor axis of the orbit , @xmath16 is the longitude of periastron ( at present @xmath17 , and @xmath18yr ) . with pulsar",
    "b mass @xmath19 , the einstein radius is @xmath20 where @xmath21  km .",
    "this is already comparable to the minimum projected a - b distance @xmath22  km .",
    "given the present uncertainty of the measurement , the real @xmath1 might be smaller than @xmath23 , increasing the strength of gravitational lensing .",
    "the typical timescale of lensing is @xmath24  s ( where @xmath25  km s@xmath26 is the relative velocity between the two pulsars ) , considerably shorter than the total duration ( @xmath27  s ) of the magnetospheric eclipse .",
    "gravitational lensing causes variation of the pulse flux during the eclipse , with the magnification factor ( paczyski 1996 ) @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the separation between the two pulsars in the plane of the sky , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the physical separation between a and b and the longitude from ascending node , respectively ( @xmath32 is a true anomaly measured from periastron )",
    ". let @xmath33 ( the a - b conjunction corresponds to @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 , we have @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath37  km ( @xmath38 ) one obtains @xmath39 .",
    "such @xmath3 flux variation due to lensing could have been marginally detectable with currently available observations ( kaspi 2004 ) at @xmath40 mhz if the superior conjunction of pulsar a were not accompanied by its simultaneous eclipse by the pulsar b s magnetosphere ( see  [ subsect : detection ] ) .",
    "this may however be possible when more data on the eclipse become available .",
    "smaller @xmath1 leads to stronger magnifications : for @xmath41  km ( @xmath42 ) , corresponding to @xmath43 deviation from the mean , we find @xmath44 ; for @xmath45  km ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the amplification of pulsar a signal by a factor of several is not inconsistent with the currently measured inclination of the system  in the end even the purely edge - on orientation of the system ( @xmath48 ) deviates only by @xmath49 from the measurement of coles ( 2004 ) .",
    "-0.8 cm    gravitational lensing has important effect on the delay of the pulse arrival time ( schneider 1990 ) .",
    "the geometric time delay is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the relative distance in the plane of the sky between the image position of the source , @xmath52 , and its fiducial position in flat space , @xmath53 ; `` @xmath54 '' refers to the image which is closer ( further ) from the source .",
    "the magnification factor of the image is @xmath55 . for @xmath56",
    "one finds @xmath57 and the two images merge into an einstein ring ; for @xmath58 one has @xmath59 and @xmath60 , but the `` @xmath61 '' image contributes negligible light ( paczynski 1996 ) .",
    "for j0737 , the maximum possible geometric delay is @xmath62 , achieved for @xmath63 ( @xmath48 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "gravitational ( shapiro ) delay amounts to as much as @xmath65 in j0737 .",
    "if lensing is neglected , the shapiro delay is given by the standard formula ( blandford & teukolsky 1976 ) @xmath66 note that for @xmath48 , this expression diverges at @xmath64 since in the absence of lensing the ray would pass through the infinitely deep potential of pulsar b. this is an artifact of neglecting the light bending caused by the lensing  the correct formula including the lensing effect is @xmath67 , \\label{eq : shap_lens}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the separation of a and b along the line of sight . it is easy to see that for @xmath69 ( no lensing ) , this expression reduces to the usual ( no lens ) result . unlike eq .",
    "( [ eq : shap_no_lens ] ) , the lensing - corrected expression ( [ eq : shap_lens ] ) never diverges : the maximum possible delay is @xmath70 = 152~\\mu s$ ] , again achieved for @xmath71 .",
    "finally , light bending causes radio pulses detected on earth to be emitted in a direction slightly different from our line of sight , by @xmath72 for the `` @xmath73 '' image .",
    "this corresponds to a different spin phase of the pulsar at the moment of pulse emission than the phase would be in the absence of lensing , leading to another timing perturbation proportional to the pulsar spin period ( schneider 1990 ) .",
    "near the superior conjunction of pulsar a this delay amounts to several @xmath5 for the pulsar a signal ( because of the large @xmath74 ) . ] .",
    "this type of delay is very interesting since it is sensitive to the orientation of the pulsar spin axis ( doroshenko & kopeikin 1995 ) .",
    "its contribution is not symmetric with respect to the conjunction point which makes possible its separation from other timing contributions . because of the importance of this delay for constraining the system s geometry we postpone its detailed study to a separate paper ( rafikov & lai 2005 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : delay ] we compare the time delay with and without the geometric delay and corrections to the shapiro delay caused by lensing effects in j0737 for the dominant , `` @xmath73 '' image near the point of eclipse of pulsar a for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we do not include the delays associated with the pulsar spin period in this figure ( this is equivalent to setting pulsar spin period to zero ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath75  km , @xmath76 differ from the conventional shapiro delay formula by @xmath77 .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of accounting for the lensing effects which affect the estimate of the system s parameters .",
    "both the geometric delay and the correction to the shapiro delay are localized near the conjunction of the pulsars and their variation has a typical timescale of @xmath78 ( unlike the shapiro delay without lensing , which varies on the scale of the orbital period of the system ) .    for @xmath79 , assuming that pulsar a is a point source ( see  [ subsect : size ] ) , one should expect to see a splitting of the original pulsar a pulse profile in two because of the two gravitationally lensed images , so that the modified pulse profile is a sum of the two weighted replicas of the normal pulsar a pulse profile slightly shifted in time with respect to each other .",
    "the relative time delay between the two contributions and their amplitudes should vary in the course of the eclipse as @xmath53 varies .",
    "this modification of the pulse profile may be difficult to detect : for @xmath80  km , one finds that at the conjunction @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the two images , with the image magnification factor @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the contribution to the total pulse profile coming from the `` @xmath61 '' image with longer time delay ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is very small .",
    "also note that the `` @xmath61 '' image samples the deeper interior of the pulsar b magnetosphere than the `` @xmath73 '' image does , which causes its stronger absorption .",
    "nevertheless , the two - image time delay corrections described above can in principle be detected with exquisite timing observations , especially if @xmath1 is small ( e.g. , for @xmath45  km , the time delays of the two images are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 ; see rafikov & lai 2005 for more details ) .      detecting any signature of lensing is made difficult in the case of j0737 by the strong flux attenuation of pulsar a at its superior conjunction .",
    "magnetospheric eclipse affects both the magnification measurements and ( to a lesser extent ) timing measurements .",
    "because of the short lensing timescale compared to the eclipse duration , the lensing magnification should manifest itself as a spike in the lightcurve of pulsar a in the inner part of the eclipse profile . using the published parameters of the eclipse ( kaspi 2004 ) we model pulsar a lightcurve in figure [ fig : lightcurve ] at @xmath89  mhz for different values of @xmath1  s )",
    ", the lightcurve shows many spikes and dips due to the modulation of a s signal by b s rotating magnetosphere ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "2004 ) . ] .",
    "the shape of the spike is skewed because the magnification profile is convolved with the eclipse lightcurve which exhibits an increase in optical depth with time .",
    "this causes the spike to occur slightly _ before _ the superior conjunction of pulsar a.    it is rather curious that strong fluctuations in the flux of pulsar a during the eclipse have already been detected .",
    "kaspi ( 2004 ) report a detection of a @xmath90 outlier in the eclipse lightcurve at @xmath89 mhz just seconds before the conjunction ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "the same phenomenon is also seen in the measurements by mclaughlin ( 2004 ) who demonstrate the variation of the eclipse profile with the rotation phase of pulsar b. in their lightcurves , among the multiple spikes and dips caused by b s magnetosphere , an anomalously high flux point has again been seen prior to the conjunction ( see their figures 1 and 3 ) .",
    "gravitational lensing can explain the outlying point in the kaspi measurements if @xmath91  km ( @xmath92 ) , corresponding to the magnification of @xmath93 .",
    "the lensing interpretation of the observed flux anomalies during the eclipse is complicated by the fact that spikes are not observed during all eclipses and there is only one strongly outlying point .",
    "also , in the rotation phase - resolved measurements of mclaughlin ( 2004 ) , one should expect to see a flux enhancement of a at the b pulse phase @xmath94 similar to that seen at the phase @xmath95 , since in both phases the unmagnified fluxes are quite significant .",
    "the error bars on all these measurements are currently too large for us to decide whether the flux anomalies are truly caused by gravitational lensing .",
    "current timing measurements of pulsar a have not been able to detect time delay during the eclipse , only the upper limit on the change in the dispersion measure during the eclipse has been set at the level of @xmath96  pc  @xmath97 ( kaspi 2004 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a current timing resolution of about @xmath98 which makes the geometric delay and lensing correction to the shapiro delay hard to observe at present  the effects are of order @xmath99 for @xmath80 km ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : delay ] ) .",
    "however , with the improved timing resolution at the level of @xmath100 , one would be able to detect them even if @xmath1 is as large as @xmath101 km ( at this @xmath1 magnification is too small to be detectable ) .",
    "timing can be a much better probe of lensing than the magnification if @xmath102 .      under many circumstances lensing",
    "can be used as a probe of the size of the source ( paczyski 1996 ) .",
    "the size of the emitting region in pulsar a is limited from above by the light cylinder radius , @xmath103  km .",
    "finite source size limits the magnification to always stay below @xmath104 ( e.g. , witt & mao 1994 ) , and any observed deviation from the point - source amplification formula could constrain @xmath105 .",
    "but unless @xmath106  km this limit can not be achieved and the finite source size effects are small . if the emitting region size in the millisecond pulsar is much smaller than @xmath107 , the detection of the source size through lensing would be unlikely .",
    "effects of general relativity are very strong in the j0737 system .",
    "they drive the evolution of its orbital parameters and affect its geometry , which directly translates into the change of the lensing signal .",
    "geodetic precession causes a wobble of the orbital plane of the system on a period of @xmath108 yrs ( burgay 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the amplitude of the inclination variation caused by this is very small , of order @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the spin angular momentum of pulsar a , @xmath111 is the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath112 is the angle between the spin axis and the orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "thus , geodetic precession is not going to affect gravitational lensing in j0737 unless @xmath113 .",
    "more important would be the effect of the periastron advance on a timescale of @xmath114 yrs .",
    "it causes the projected distance between the two pulsars at their conjunction , @xmath1 , to vary from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",
    "thus , in the course of the apsidal precession , @xmath1 varies by about @xmath117 .",
    "this causes a change in the lensing signatures ( both magnification and timing ) at a similar level of @xmath118 and might be detectable in the future .",
    "additional propagation effects are caused by the plasma refractivity in the magnetosphere of pulsar b during the eclipse ( e.g. emmering & london 1990 ) . assuming that the magnetospheric charge density is @xmath119 times the goldreich - julian density ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) , the deviation of the index of refraction from unity is of order @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the radio wave frequency in ghz and density is evaluated at the einstein radius @xmath23 .",
    "is reduced further , making the refractive effect of the plasma even less important .",
    "] by contrast , the effective index of refraction due to lensing deviates from unity by @xmath122 . for the j0737 system ,",
    "@xmath119 is likely of order @xmath123 ( rafikov & goldreich 2005 ) , in which case the propagation effects due to the plasma in the vicinity of pulsar b are not important compared to the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "since the gravitational lensing signal is strongly dependent upon the minimum projected separation @xmath1 of the pulsars in the plane of the sky , the detection of lensing effects could provide tighter constraints on the system s inclination , which is currently known at an accuracy of @xmath124 .",
    "timing would be a good probe of the inclination if @xmath102 while the magnification signal would also be useful for handling the case @xmath125 .",
    "we have already mentioned that the correction to the shapiro delay and the additional geometric delay caused by lensing at the binary conjunction may affect the estimation of the system s parameters .",
    "this suggests that lensing must be accounted for when dealing with the effects of general relativity in j0737 .",
    "gravitational light bending is also relevant for the measurements using the correlation of scintillations of the two pulsars .",
    "the analysis of coles ( 2004 ) assumes that pulsar a s trajectory in the plane of the sky is a straight line at the conjunction .",
    "this is not true if lensing is strong because it displaces the position of pulsar a on the sky along a _ curved _ path deviating from the straight line trajectory by @xmath126 . even for @xmath80  km",
    ", the shift can be as large as @xmath4  km , almost @xmath127 of the minimum separation claimed by coles ( 2004 ) .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of incorporating lensing effects into the analysis of scintillation correlations which could further refine the estimate of inclination obtained by coles ( 2004 ) .",
    "light bending also causes the radio beam of pulsar a to pass through the regions in the pulsar b magnetosphere which would otherwise not be sampled by the beam .",
    "since the magnetospheric absorption depends strongly on the distance from pulsar b ( rafikov & goldreich 2005 ) , one expects gravitational lensing to have an important effect on the eclipse profile of pulsar a. variations in the pattern of magnetospheric absorption would then be expected on a timescale of apsidal precession because of the change in the minimum projected distance between the two pulsars at conjunction ( see  [ subsect : evolution ] ) .",
    "pulsar a can produce gravitational lensing of pulsar b in exactly the same way as b does it with pulsar a. the einstein radius of pulsar a is slightly larger than that of pulsar b , @xmath128  km instead of @xmath129  km , and the measurements would probably be cleaner in this case ( although the timing accuracy of b is not as good as that of a ) since the radio beam of pulsar b would not pass through the magnetosphere of pulsar a ( with light cylinder radius @xmath130  km ) . unfortunately , pulsar b is currently very weak at the orbital phases when it is behind pulsar a ( ramachandran 2004 ) which makes it hard to detect lensing in this orbital configuration .",
    "however , the system s geometry will change due to the effects of general relativity and pulsar b might become active and bright at its superior conjunction ( jenet & ransom 2004 ) .",
    "this may give us additional handle on the gravitational lensing in j0737 and permit the determination of the pulsar b spin axis orientation ( see  [ subsect : delay ] ) .",
