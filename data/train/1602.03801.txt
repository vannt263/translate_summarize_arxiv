    "damage induced by mechanical or hydraulic perturbations influences the permeability of the rock mass , with significant effects on the pore pressure distribution .",
    "modifications in the pore pressure , in turn , affects the mechanical response of the material by poromechanical coupling . according to experimental observations at the microscopic scale , fracture evolution in rocks can be interpreted essentially as a progressive damage accumulation process , characterized by nucleation , growth and coalescence of numerous cracks following changes in the external load or in the internal pore pressure @xcite . in the particular case of hydraulic fracturing , a stimulation technique used in petroleum industry to increase the oil / gas production in low permeability reservoirs , fractures are produced by the artificial increase of the fluid pressure in a borehole . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "it has been observed that the success of hydraulic fracturing is related to : i ) the creation of a dense system of hydraulic cracks with limited spacing ; and ii ) the prevention or mitigation of localization instabilities @xcite .",
    "models of distributed damage and permeability based on abstract damage mechanics are , of necessity , empirical in nature and the precise meaning and geometry of the damage variables often remains undefined or is associated with unrealistic microstructures such as distributions of isolated microcracks . in addition , the evolution of the damage variables and their relation to the deformation , stress and permeability of the rock mass is described by means of empirical and phenomenological laws that represent , at best , enlightened data fits .",
    "however , the permeability enhancement due to extensive fracturing of a rock mass depends sensitively on precise details of the topology , which needs to be _ connected _ , and geometry of the crack set , including the orientation and spacing of the cracks .",
    "in addition , the coupled hydro - mechanical response of the rock , especially when complex loading conditions and histories are of concern , is much too complex to yield to empirical data fitting .",
    "based on these considerations , in this paper we endeavor to develop a model of distributed fracturing of rock masses , and the attendant permeability enhancement thereof , based on an _ explicit micromechanical construction _ of connected patterns of cracks , or faults .",
    "the approach extends the multi - scale brittle damage material model introduced in @xcite , which is limited to mechanical damage .",
    "in contrast to abstract damage mechanics , the fracture patterns that form the basis of the theory are _ explicit _ and the rock mass undergoes deformations that are compatible and remain in static equilibrium down to the micromechanical level .",
    "the fracture patterns are not arbitrary : they are shown in @xcite to be optimal as regards their ability to relieve deviatoric stresses , and the inception , orientation and spacing of the fractures derive rigorously from energetic considerations . following inception",
    ", fractures can deform by frictional sliding or undergo opening .",
    "the extension of the theory presented here additionally accounts for fluid pressure by recourse to terzaghi s effective stress principle . when the fluid pressure is sufficiently high , existing fractures can open , thereby contributing to the permeability of the rock mass . by virtue of the explicit and connected nature of the predicted fractures",
    ", the attendant permeability enhancement can be estimated using simple relations from standard lubrication theory @xcite , resulting in a fully - coupled hydro - mechanical model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : hydromechanics ] with illustrating the hydromechanical framework , recalling the basic equations and the terzaghi s effective stress principle . in section  [ sec : brittledamage ] we recall the main features of the dry material model developed in @xcite , introducing a pressure dependent behavior at fault inception . in section  [ sec : permeability ] we derive analytically the permeability associated to the presence of faults in the brittle damage material model . in section  [ sec : examples ] we validate the material model by means of comparison with experimental results taken from the literature .",
    "in porous media saturated with freely moving fluids , deterioration of mechanical and hydraulic properties of rock masses and subsequent problems are closely related to changes in the stress state , formation of new cracks , and increase of permeability . in fully saturated rocks ,",
    "fluid and solid phases are fully interconnected and the interaction between fluid and rock is characterized by coupled diffusion - deformation mechanisms that convey an apparent time - dependent character to the mechanical properties of the system .",
    "the two governing equations of the coupled problem are the linear momentum balance and the continuity equation ( mass conservation ) .",
    "the kinematic quantities that characterize this picture are the porous solid displacement @xmath0 and the rate of fluid volume per unit area @xmath1 .",
    "hydro - mechanical coupling arises from the influence of the mechanical variables ( stress , strain and displacement ) on the continuity equation , where the primary variable is the fluid pressure , and from the influence of the hydraulic variables ( pore pressure and seepage velocity ) on the equilibrium equations , where the primary variables are the displacements .",
    "the energy of a fluid flowing in a porous medium is traditionally measured in terms of total hydraulic head @xmath2 , that for slow flowing fluids reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fluid density and @xmath5 the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the pressure head @xmath6 is the equivalent gauge pressure of a column of water at the base of a piezometer .",
    "the elevation head @xmath7 expresses the relative potential energy .",
    "the kinetic energy contribution , @xmath8 , is disregarded , given the small velocity @xmath9 of the fluid .",
    "flow across packed porous media is generally characterized by laminar regime ( reynolds number re @xmath10 1 ) and by a drop of the hydraulic head in the direction of the flow .",
    "analytical models of fluid flow in rocks use constitutive relations that link the average fluid velocity across the medium to the hydraulic head drop . as representative example of constitutive relation in material form , darcy s law",
    "states that the rate relative to the solid skeleton of the discharge per unit area of porous media , @xmath11 , is proportional to the hydraulic head gradient @xmath12 and inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the material permeability tensor .",
    "permeability measures the ability for fluids ( gas or liquid ) to flow through a porous solid material ; it is intrinsically related to the void topology and does not account for the properties of the fluid . in anisotropic media , permeability is a symmetric ( consequence of the onsager reciprocal relations ) and positive definite ( a fluid can not flow against the pressure drop ) second order tensor @xmath15 .",
    "real eigenvalues of the permeability tensor are the principal permeabilities , and the corresponding eigenvectors indicate the principal directions of flow , i.e. , the directions where flow is parallel to the pressure drop .",
    "clearly , fractures modify the permeability tensor , introducing new preferential directions for fluid flow .",
    "although affected by many factors , in non  fractured materials permeability is primarily related to the rock porosity ( or void fraction ) @xmath16 , expressing the ratio between the volume of the voids @xmath17 and the total volume @xmath18 , which includes also the volume of solids @xmath19 @xmath20 in finite kinematics , the porosity is naturally associated to the jacobian of the deformation gradient @xmath21 . by denoting the porosity of the stress - free material with @xmath22 , it holds @xmath23 ( see appendix a for details of the derivation , also cf .",
    "note that , for very low values of @xmath22 and @xmath24 , eq .   may provide negative values for @xmath16 , thus a zero lower - bound must be enforced in calculations .",
    "the rate of fluid volume @xmath25 is linked to the porosity through the continuity equation , which for partially saturated voids in material form reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 the degree of saturation ( i.  e. , the fraction of the fluid volume ) , @xmath28 the material divergence operator , and @xmath29 the partial derivative with respect to time . under the rather standard assumption of fully saturated voids and incompressible fluid ,",
    "the continuity equation becomes @xcite @xmath30      in the absence of any occluded porosity , the solid grains forming the matrix generally undergo negligible volume changes . in keeping with standard assumptions in geomechanics , we consider the solid phase of the matrix incompressible",
    ", thus we regard the change of the volume of the matrix as a change of the volume of the voids of the matrix .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the adoption of the terzaghi s theory , used here in lieu of the more sophisticated biot theory , chosen for the sake of simplicity and to limit the number of parameters .",
    "moreover , we consider fully saturated media .    in finite kinematics",

    "the brittle damage model presented in @xcite is characterized by a homogeneous matrix where nested microstructures of different length scales are embedded . at each level ( or rank ) @xmath44 of the nested architecture , microstructures assume the form of families of cohesive faults , characterized by an orientation @xmath45 and a uniform spacing @xmath46 , see fig .

    "the total deformation gradient @xmath34 of the material is assumed to decompose multiplicatively into a part @xmath49 pertaining the uniform deformation of the matrix , and a part @xmath50 describing the discontinuous kinematics of the cohesive faults , i.  e. , @xmath51 the discontinuous deformation gradient @xmath50 is related to the kinematic activity of the faults @xcite , expressed through an opening displacement @xmath52 acting on each fault of the family as ( see fig .",

    "we assume that friction operates at the faults concurrently with cohesion .",

    "literature data testify apparently contradictory observations in the brittle regime @xcite . among the triaxial experiments on berea sandstone with different confinement reported in @xcite , we selected three small confinement triaxial experiments , characterized by a softening stress - strain curve .",
    "pre and post - peak porosity and permeability data are included in the experimental paper .",
    "we simulated the experimental tests at confining pressures of 5 , 10 and 40  mpa .",
    "experimental and numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sandstone ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : bereastress ] shows the deviatoric stress versus the axial deformation .",
    "simulations capture nicely the peak stress for the three tests , while the softening branch is not perfectly reproduced .",
    "[ fig : bereaporo ] compares numerical and experimental porosity for the two tests at lower confinement pressure . in both simulation and experiment ,",
    "porosity reduces progressively until the stress peak is reached , and grows during the softening phase , in correspondence to the reduction of the deviatoric stress .",
    "simulations predict qualitatively and quantitatively the variation of porosity during the test .",
    "contrariwise , the comparison between model predictions and experimental observations in terms of permeability evolution is not satisfactory , even from the qualitative point of view . in the experiments , permeability decreased markedly after the stress peak , showing a marked negative correlation between permeability and porosity changes fig .",
    "[ fig : bereapermexp ] . experimental data on different sandstones are qualitatively similar , suggesting that permeability evolution as a function of porosity does not follow any systematic trend .",
    "a possible explanation of the observed permeability reduction in particular dilating sandstone is that microcracking dramatically increases the tortuosity of the pore space @xcite .",
    "the brittle damage model predicts a post - peak increase in permeability , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bereapermnum ] , which is opposite to the berea sandstone experiments , but in line with many experimental results on low permeability geomaterials , and is also in agreement with the simulations on granites discussed here .",
    "we have developed a model of distributed fracturing of rock masses , and the attendant permeability enhancement thereof , based on an explicit micromechanical construction resulting in complex connected patterns of cracks , or faults .",
    "the approach extends the multi - scale brittle damage material model introduced in @xcite , which was limited to mechanical damage .",
    "the fracture patterns that form the basis of the theory are not implied but explicitly defined and the rock mass undergoes throughout compatible deformations and remains in static equilibrium , not just on average at the macroscopic scale , but also the micromechanical level .",
    "the sequential faulting construction used to generate the fracture patterns has been shown in @xcite to be optimal as regards the ability of the fracture patterns to relieve stress .",
    "in addition , the nucleation criterion , orientation and spacing of the faults derive rigorously from energetic considerations .",
    "following nucleation , fractures can deform by frictional sliding or undergo opening , thereby partially relieving the geostatic stresses in the rock mass .",
    "the extension of the theory presented in this paper additionally accounts for fluid pressure by recourse to terzaghi s effective stress principle .",
    "specifically , we estimate the permeability enhancement resulting from fracture enhancement using standard lubrication theory @xcite .",
    "this extension gives rise to a fully - coupled hydro - mechanical model .",
    "the formulation has been derived in finite kinematics to be consistent with the formulation of the damage model in [ 18 ] .",
    "a finite kinematics approach is able to describe both large and small strains , so that the model can be applied also to porous media different from rocks .",
    "a linear version of the model is currently under development , in view of heavy numerical applications in field problems .",
    "the dry mechanical aspects of the model were validated in @xcite by means of comparisons with the dynamic multiaxial compression experiments on sintered aluminum nitride ( aln ) of chen and ravichandran @xcite .",
    "the model was shown to correctly predict the general trends regarding the experimental observed damage patterns , as well as the brittle - to - ductile transition resulting under increasing confinement .",
    "the hydro - mechanical coupled model has been validated against three different sets of experimental data concerned with triaxial tests at different confinement pressure on granite and sandstone , including lac du bonnet @xcite and beisahn @xcite granites and berea sandstone @xcite .",
    "the ability of the model to reproduce qualitatively the experimental peak strength , post - peak stress - strain behavior , and permeability enhancement during loading and recovery during unloading is remarkable .",
    "the present coupled hydro - mechanical model has potential for use in applications , such as rocks under geostatic conditions , gravity dams , hydraulic fracture operations , and others , in which a solid deforms and undergoes extensive fracture under all - around confinement while simultaneously being infiltrated by a fluid .",
    "the particular case of hydraulic fracture is characterized by the injection of fluid at high pressure , which actively promotes the fracture process and the transport of fluid into the rock mass . under such conditions ,",
    "the present model is expected to predict the development of three - dimensional fracture patterns of great complexity over multiple scales .",
    "such complex fracture patterns have indeed been inferred from acoustic measurements in actual hydraulic fracture operations @xcite and are in sharp contrast to traditional models of hydraulic fracture , which posit the formation of a single mathematically - sharp crack .",
    "the present model thus represents a paradigm shift from said traditional models in its ability to account for complexity in the fracture pattern over multiple scale while simultaneously supplying macroscopic effective properties such as permeability and strength that can in turn be used , e.  g. , in full - field finite element simulations .",
    "by denoting the time derivative with @xmath171 , we write @xmath172 assuming that the solid volume variation is small with respect to the void volume , @xmath173 and @xmath174",
    ". thus the rate of porosity change becomes : @xmath175 this relation can be alternatively written in the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 is a constant , which can be derived by setting as initial values @xmath178 and @xmath22 , obtaining @xmath179",
