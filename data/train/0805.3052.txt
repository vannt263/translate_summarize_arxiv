    "high - energy - density physics is a new way for astrophysicists to explore phenomena usually occurring in the universe .",
    "the use of powerful facilities , enables us to bring the matter up to extreme states of density and temperature in laboratory @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical relevance of these experiments can be checked from scaling laws provided the physical system under study satisfies similarity properties .",
    "thus , scaling laws and similarity properties must be examined with rigorous formalism .",
    "several studies have been published about similarity and scaling laws .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , @xcite , purely hydrodynamics and mhd scaling laws are respectively considered and in @xcite , the birkhoff polytropic symmetries @xcite are recovered .",
    "moreover , in @xcite optically thin radiative hydrodynamic scaling laws have been considered and in @xcite , the author not only studied similarity in case of optically thin plasma too but , also , discussed non - lte situations through a microscopic approach .",
    "all these works have been carried out in an astrophysical context and were mainly based upon dimensional arguments .",
    "scaling laws were also obtained for the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) @xcite , @xcite in order to determine the minimum energy required for ignition .",
    "these are very interesting too because they can be used as non trivial tests for numerical simulations . in this paper",
    ", we study the radiating fluid similarity problem in two different regimes that can be ( or will be ) achieved in laboratory with current or future facilities . in each case",
    ", we derive the corresponding scaling laws and in order to get rigorous and exact relations , our approach is based on the lie groups @xcite . in the first part , we describe this method and remind its fundamental concepts .",
    "the second part deals with the optically thin radiating fluids , which are a major topic in astrophysics .",
    "comparisons with other results obtained earlier are carried out .",
    "finally we consider the equilibrium diffusion approximation including radiative pressure and energy . for each approximation ,",
    "connections with astrophysical objects are provided and we emphasize the number of free parameters left to rescale an experiment .",
    "the invariant transformation group theory elaborated by sophus lie is a very powerful tool of theoritical physics to study the symmetry properties of partial differential equations ( pde ) and to perform their analytical integration . among all lie groups , one of them , namely , the one - parameter homothetic group ( hg ) is frequently used , first because of its simplicity and , then , because it provides more general self - similar solutions than those derived from dimensional analysis .",
    "this property arises because the hg is a sub - group of scaling transformations .",
    "now , remembering the philosophy of laboratory astrophysics ( _ i.e. _ to recreate systems having astronomical size on short scales ) , it seems natural to use the hg in order to study similarity properties , scaling laws and even self - similarity . here , we will focus on the first two points only .",
    "group invariance of pde together with their solutions implies that the initial conditions ( ic ) be preserved from the laboratory system to the astrophysical one .",
    "this intuitive but constraining condition is discussed in details in @xcite , @xcite . from this property , experimental data and ic in laboratory provide , first",
    ", information about astrophysical environments and , second , a transposition to astronomical objects .",
    "moreover , the invariance of equations by hg implies that the rankine - hugoniot relations are also invariant and , therefore , we make sure that small scale shocks correspond to the homothetic structures of astrophysical shocks .",
    "when the cooling ( or heating ) characteristic time of a plasma gets close to its dynamical time , this should be considered in the modeling . concerning optically thin plasmas , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the mean free path of photons and @xmath2 is the characteristic plasmas of the system ) , a simple modeling of radiating losses ( or heating ) can be done simply by introducing a loss ( or gain ) of entropy .",
    "thus , the plasma is described by the following equations : @xmath3=0,\\quad \\rho\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}=-\\vec{\\nabla}p_{th},\\quad \\frac{d p_{th}}{dt}-\\gamma\\frac{p_{th}}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dt}=-(\\gamma-1)\\mathcal{l}(\\rho , t),\\quad dm=\\rho.dv,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the lagrangian derivative and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the density , velocity , thermal pressure , polytropic index and the mass of the fluid .",
    "the function @xmath10 writes @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are energy sources ( or losses ) .",
    "in addition , we assumed a polytropic evolution ; _ i.e. _ @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the specific internal energy .",
    "finally , an equation of state should be added to close ( [ eq1:eq ] ) : @xmath16\\rho^{\\mu}t^{\\nu}$ ] where @xmath17 $ ] is a function of the ionization z. it should be noticed that to satisfy the first thermodynamical principle we should have @xmath18 .",
    "experimentally , heating can represent the laser energy deposition . from an astrophysical viewpoint , this modeling describes interstellar jets , bow shocks , radiating shocks ( point c in drake diagram @xcite , fig 7.17 ) in polars and supernova remnants .",
    "the relation between the typical quantities in astrophysical objects and laboratory experiments ( that we note with @xmath19 ) are given by : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the group parameter and @xmath32 are the homothetic exponants .",
    "rescaling @xmath33 , and @xmath34 can absorb a modification of z from one system to the other ( for example in bremsstrahlung cooling @xmath35 ) . up to now",
    ", the sources have not been specified but in the applications we will consider power law forms ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this type of source is quite suitable for cooling since several processes in the continuum write in this simple form .",
    "we can also write @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath39 is the planck mean opacity that can be modeled by a power law at high temperature .",
    "the invariance of equations under the hg provides the group invariants @xcite namely : @xmath40 ( strouhal number ) , @xmath41 , @xmath42 $ ] ( @xmath43 : euler number , @xmath44 : mach number ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the characteristic time of the sources @xmath48 and @xmath49 $ ] ( mass conservation ) .",

    "however , our approach is more general since we have local dimensionless quantities in contrast to global dimensionless numbers obtained thanks to the dimensional analysis .",
    "thus , in our extension , the physical fields are conserved .",
    "table 1 shows scaling laws for polars .",
    "generally , we have four free parameters ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) and , if we preserve ionization , only two ( resp . one ) exponent(s ) remain(s ) for a single source ( resp .",
    "two sources ) . moreover , if we set @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we get the similarity considerations of @xcite . thus , with the same formalism , we can study similarity properties , scaling laws , and include the specific case presented in @xcite .",
    "many systems , as well in laboratory as in astrophysics , are optically thick to radiation .",
    "for instance , the many classes of stars are more or less affected by radiation .",
    "radiative pressure implies that there is an upper limit to the mass of a star ( eddington limit ) . generally , including radiative flux in laboratory experiments is enough and that is why , researches about scaling laws in this regime",
    "have been carried out in icf . here , we add the energy and pressure of radiation ( see @xcite ) in the diffusion approximation at etl . in experiments , lte is usually satisfied @xcite and it will be achieved on lmj and nif . in astrophysics ,",
    "radiation pressure and energy play a key role in stars , supernovae , in evaporation phenomena , in clumps @xcite ... the plasma evolution is then governed by the equations ( @xcite , pp 270 - 271 ) : @xmath88 ,",

    "we recover the standard dimensionless numbers @xcite which describe these radiating fluids .",
    "the scaling laws are presented in table 2 .",
