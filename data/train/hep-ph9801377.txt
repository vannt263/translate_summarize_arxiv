    "in perturbative qcd analysis of the regge asymptotics of hadronic scattering amplitudes , the power rise with energy of the physical cross - sections is attributed to the contribution of the color - singlet compound gluonic states .",
    "these states are built from an arbitrary conserved number , @xmath2 , of reggeized gluons , or reggeons , and they can be defined as solutions of the effective @xmath3dimensional schrdinger equation @xcite _",
    "n |_n,\\{q } = e_n,\\{q } |_n,\\{q}. the effective qcd hamiltonian @xmath4 describes a pair - wise interaction between @xmath0 reggeons on the 2-dimensional plane of their transverse coordinates , @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath0 , and its explicit form can be found in @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal gluonic degrees of freedom define the rapidity of reggeons that enter into ( [ bkp ] ) as a evolution time .",
    "the wave function @xmath8 depends on some set of quantum numbers @xmath9 and the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath10 of the reggeon compound state .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 reggeon states to the physical cross section has a form @xmath11 and at large energies @xmath12 it is dominated by the state with the maximal energy , @xmath13 . therefore solving the schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] )",
    "one is mostly interesting in finding the state with the energy @xmath14 , or equivalently the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) has a number of remarkable properties .",
    "the effective qcd hamiltonian @xmath4 is invariant under projective @xmath16 transformations of the 2-dimensional gluon coordinates @xmath17 @xcite z_j=_x_j+i_y_j,|z_j = z_j^*,z_j with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being ( anti)holomorphic reggeon coordinates .",
    "denoting the generators of these transformations as l_0=_k=1^n z_k _ k , l_-=_k=1^n _ k , l_+=_k=1^n z_k^2 _ k , and having similar expressions for the antiholomorphic generators , one may verify that @xmath20=[{\\cal h}_n,\\bar l_\\alpha]=0 $ ] .",
    "this symmetry allows to classify possible solutions to ( [ bkp ] ) according to the representations of the @xmath16 group .",
    "in particular , the wave function is transformed under projective transformations as _ n,\\{q } ( cz_0+d)^2h ( |c|z_0+|d)^2|h _ n,\\{q } with @xmath21 being ( anti)holomorphic coordinates of the center - of - mass .",
    "the conformal weights of the state , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , take the values corresponding to the unitary principal series representation of the @xmath16 group @xcite h=2+i,|h=2+i,(n=,= ) parameterized by the pair @xmath24 of integer @xmath25 and real @xmath26 .",
    "these parameters determine the spin @xmath27 and the scaling dimension @xmath28 of the state and control the transformation properties of the state under rotations , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and dilatations , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    being expressed in terms of holomorphic and antiholomorphic reggeon coordinates , the effective hamiltonian splits into the sum of two mutually commuting @xmath35dimensional hamiltonians acting separately on ( anti)holomorphic coordinates , @xmath36 and @xmath37=0 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this property is exact for @xmath38 and @xmath1 reggeon states and for @xmath39 it holds in the multi - color limit of qcd .",
    "it implies that the original equation ( [ bkp ] ) can be replaced by the system of two @xmath35dimensional schrdinger equations in holomorphic and antiholomorphic subspaces . as a result",
    ", the wave function of the state can be factorized as _",
    "c _ _ n,(z )    of @xmath0 holomorphic coordinates and the coefficients @xmath40 are fixed by the condition for @xmath41 to be a well defined function of its arguments on the 2-dimensional plane of transverse coordinates .",
    "additionally , the energy @xmath42 of the state can be evaluated as the sum of holomorphic and antiholomorphic energies that one finds solving two @xmath35dimensional schrdinger equations .",
    "it turns out that the holomorphic hamiltonian @xmath43 coincides with the hamiltonian of 1-dimensional heisenberg magnet of noncompact @xmath16 spin zero @xcite .",
    "there is however an important difference between the holomorphic hamiltonian @xmath43 and well - known integrable @xmath35dimensional hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "examining the properties of @xmath43 one finds @xcite that in contrast with the full @xmath3dimensional effective hamiltonian , the operator @xmath43 is unbounded on the space of the wave functions ( [ pro ] ) .",
    "the same property holds for the antiholomorphic hamiltonian @xmath44 .",
    "it is only the sum of holomorphic and antiholomorphic @xmath35dimensional hamiltonians that is bounded from above .",
    "this happens because the holomorphic and antiholomorphic energies depend on the common set of quantum numbers ( [ h ] ) and infinities cancel in their sum .",
    "analyzing the schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) one finds @xcite that it possesses the family of mutually commuting holomorphic and antiholomorphic integrals of motion , @xmath45 , @xmath46 defined as q_k = i^k_1j_1 < ... < j_k n z_j_1j_2 ... z_j_kj_1 _ j_1 ... _ j_k , = 0 , where @xmath47 and the definition of the antiholomorphic charges @xmath48 is similar with @xmath49 replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "the total number of the conserved charges , @xmath51 , is large enough for the @xmath52gluon schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) to be completely integrable .",
    "the wave function of the @xmath52reggeon state , @xmath53 , diagonalizes these charges and one identifies the corresponding eigenvalues as a complete set of quantum numbers @xmath9 introduced before in ( [ bkp ] ) .",
    "one also takes into account that on the space of the wave functions ( [ pro ] ) the holomorphic and antiholomorphic charges are related as @xcite @xmath54    the integrability of the schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) ensures that the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 acting on the @xmath55 coordinates of reggeons can be expressed as a complicated function of @xmath51 integrals of motion @xmath56 plus @xmath57 operators reserved for the components of the center - of - mass momentum of the state .",
    "we notice however that ( anti)holomorphic components of the total momentum coincide with the generators , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , of the projective transformations ( [ l s ] ) and the dependence of the hamiltonian on them is protected by the @xmath16 symmetry , @xmath60=0 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the following identity @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the energy of the ( anti)holomorphic hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the problem of calculating the spectrum of the effective qcd hamiltonian ( [ bkp ] ) is reduced , first , to finding the explicit form of @xmath62 as a real function of the conserved charges @xmath63 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 and , second , to establishing the quantization conditions for their eigenvalues .",
    "the first part of the problem was studied using different approaches @xcite and similar results for @xmath62 were obtained . in the present paper",
    "we address the problem of finding the spectrum of the conserved charges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the sect .",
    "2 we employ the wkb expansion to obtain the quantization conditions for the eigenvalues of conserved charges . we show in sect .",
    "3 that these conditions have the form of the whitham equations . solving the whitham equations in the special case of @xmath1 reggeon states we obtain the quantized charges @xmath63 and @xmath65 and study their properties in sect .",
    "4 . concluding remarks can be found in sect .",
    "appendix contains some properties of the elliptic integrals which are helpful in solving the whitham equation .",
    "the `` lowest '' integrals of motion , @xmath63 and @xmath66 , provide the simplest example of the quantization conditions .",
    "one verifies using ( [ l s ] ) and ( [ q ] ) that @xmath63 and @xmath66 coincide with the quadratic casimir operators of the @xmath16 group , @xmath67 , and for the wave functions transforming as ( [ pro ] ) their eigenvalues take the form q_2=-h(h-1)=14-(2+i)^2,|q_2=-|h(|h-1)=q_2^ * , being discrete in @xmath25 and continuous in @xmath26 .",
    "the quantization conditions for `` higher '' integrals of motion @xmath68 and @xmath48 ( @xmath69 ) are more involved @xcite .",
    "one can get some insight into their properties by exploring the relation between the wave functions of reggeon compound states @xmath41 and 2-dimensional conformal field theories . to this end , let us consider the following function @xcite @xmath70 according to its properties under the projective transformations , ( [ pro ] ) , the function @xmath71 can be represented as @xmath72point correlation function in 2-dimensional conformal field theory _ n(z,|z)= .",
    "here , @xmath73 is a quasiprimary reggeon field with the conformal weights @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a quasiprimary operator interpolating the @xmath0 reggeon compound state . the operator @xmath76 has the conformal weights ( [ h ] ) and it is transformed under ( [ sl2 ] ) according to the irreducible principal series representation ( irreps ) of the @xmath16 group labeled as @xmath77 . for the reggeon operator @xmath73 the corresponding irreps can be identified as @xmath78 .",
    "the product of @xmath0 reggeon operators in ( [ cf ] ) is reducible with respect to the action of the @xmath16 transformations .",
    "it corresponds to the tensor product of @xmath0 copies of @xmath78 which in turn can be decomposed into irreducible components using the following fusion rules @xcite @xmath79 in conformal field theory these relations are implemented in the operator product expansion of the quasiprimary operators @xmath73 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "applying the fusion rules @xmath81 times one obtains an expansion of the product @xmath82 in ( [ cf ] ) into an infinite sum of the irreducible components .",
    "each component can be parameterized in two equivalent ways : either by the conformal weights @xmath83 plus the set of @xmath84 quantum numbers @xmath56 , or by the set of @xmath51 numbers @xmath85 corresponding to the @xmath81 intermediate states @xmath86 .",
    "this leads to the following dependence q_k = q_k((n_1,_1), ... ,(n_n-1,_n-1 ) ) , ( k=2, ... ,n ) together with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thus , apart from the set @xmath89 defining the conformal weight of the @xmath0 reggeon state , one expects the appearance of @xmath90 additional sets @xmath85 parameterizing the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath68 and @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , for given conformal weights @xmath83 the possible values of the quantum numbers @xmath68 and @xmath48 form the family of continuous functions of real @xmath91 , @xmath7 , @xmath92 , different members of which are labeled by integers @xmath93 , @xmath7 , @xmath94 .",
    "let us consider two special cases .",
    "in the first case , one takes all @xmath95 and @xmath96 . using ( [ h ] )",
    "one finds that it corresponds to restricting the conformal weights of the intermediate states @xmath86 and the @xmath0 reggeon state , @xmath97 , to take only integer values .",
    "the spectrum of the operators @xmath68 and @xmath48 is expected to be discrete .",
    "indeed , this result was previously obtained within the algebraic bethe ansatz approach @xcite by numerical solution of the bethe equations @xcite and later the analytical expressions for quantized @xmath68 and @xmath48 were derived in the quasiclassical approximation @xcite . in the second case , one chooses @xmath98 and @xmath99 are arbitrary .",
    "the conformal weights of the intermediate states have the form @xmath100 and they run along imaginary axis .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that it is for these values of the conformal weights that the energy of the @xmath0 reggeon states approaches its maximal value .",
    "the quantized @xmath68 and @xmath48 become continuous functions of real @xmath91 , @xmath7 , @xmath101 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , these functions can be found within the wkb approach as solutions of the whitham equations . in the next section",
    "we derive these equations , solve them and study the properties of quantized @xmath68 and @xmath48 .      the eigenvalue problem for the operators @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath48 defined in ( [ q ] ) leads to a complicated system of partial differential equations of the @xmath52th order on the wave function @xmath102 .",
    "one can significantly simplify the problem by using the fact that quantization of the charges @xmath68 and @xmath48 does not depend on the particular representation in which the wave function @xmath102 is defined in order to go from @xmath103coordinates to a new set of _ separated _ holomorphic reggeon coordinates @xcite , @xmath104, ... @xmath105 , and their antiholomorphic counterparts @xmath106 .    in the separated",
    "coordinates the wave function of the @xmath0 reggeon state is factorized into the product of functions each depending on only one coordinate _",
    "n(x,|x)=q(x_1) ... q(x_n-1 ) x_n^-h q(|x_1) ...",
    "q(|x_n-1 ) |x_n^-|h . here",
    ", the function @xmath107 is a solution of the second order finite - difference equation @xcite q(x+i)+q(x - i)=x^-n(x ) q(x),(x)=2x^n+q_2x^n-2+ ... +q_n known as the baxter equation and @xmath108 satisfies similar relation with all @xmath68 replaced by @xmath109 .",
    "the separated gluon coordinates have the following properties .",
    "the coordinates @xmath105 and @xmath110 correspond to the center - of - mass motion and they are defined as eigenvalues of the operators x_n = l_0l_-^-1 , |x_n= |l_0 |l_-^-1 with @xmath58 and @xmath111 being the @xmath16 generators ( [ l s ] ) . the definition of the remaining coordinates @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 is more involved and it can be found in @xcite",
    ". it will be important for us that they satisfy the relations @xcite @xmath115=[l_-,x_k]=0\\,,\\qquad [ l_0,x_n]=ix_n\\,,\\qquad [ l_-,x_n]=-i\\ ] ] with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath81 and similar relations hold for @xmath113 and @xmath116 . from these relations",
    "one finds that the separated coordinates @xmath112 and @xmath113 , being functions of the gluon @xmath117coordinates , are invariant under translations , @xmath118 , and dilatations , @xmath119 , while the coordinates @xmath105 and @xmath110 are transformed in the same way as @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , in the expression ( [ chi ] ) for the wave function in separated coordinates , it is the factor @xmath122 that carries the spin @xmath123 and the scaling dimension @xmath124 of the @xmath0 reggeon state .",
    "moreover , making the shift , @xmath125 , one can restore the dependence of the wave function ( [ chi ] ) on the center - of - mass coordinate of the state , @xmath21 , as @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xmath128 .",
    "the wave function ( [ wf ] ) has to be a well defined function of the reggeon coordinates @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "performing transition to the separated coordinates one imposes the same condition on ( [ chi ] ) as a function of the complex @xmath112 and @xmath106 .",
    "let us first examine the dependence of @xmath102 on the coordinate @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath102 is a single valued function of complex @xmath105 it should not be changed as @xmath129 in ( [ chi ] ) .",
    "one checks that this is true provided that the spin @xmath130 of the state is integer . requiring additionally that the scaling dimension of the state has to be @xmath131 one reproduces the quantization conditions ( [ h ] ) for the conformal weights .",
    "we notice that although the wave function ( [ chi ] ) stays invariant under @xmath132 rotations on the @xmath133plane , its holomorphic and antiholomorphic components get nontrivial monodromies for all values of the conformal weights @xmath22 and @xmath23 except for integer ones .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the polynomial solutions studied in @xcite .    to satisfy the condition of singlevaluedness for the dependence of ( [ chi ] ) on",
    "the remaining coordinates @xmath112 one has to examine the properties of the product @xmath134 on the complex @xmath135plane .",
    "as we will show below , this consideration leads to the selection rules for the quantum numbers @xmath65 , @xmath7 , @xmath64      the function @xmath107 entering ( [ chi ] ) obeys the baxter equation ( [ beq ] ) .",
    "this equation has two linear independent solutions , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , satisfying the normalization condition @xmath138 and having the following asymptotics at infinity q_+(x ) ~x^h , q_-(x ) ~x^1-h .",
    "the analysis of the baxter equation for the function @xmath139 is similar since the functions @xmath140 and @xmath141 satisfy the same equation . as a result ,",
    "one gets the following general expression @xmath142 with @xmath143 being arbitrary coefficients .",
    "however , it follows from ( [ as ] ) that for the conformal weights @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the form ( [ h ] ) the functions @xmath136 and @xmath137 acquire nontrivial monodromies at infinity as @xmath144 , which should cancel in the product @xmath134 .",
    "this requirement leads to @xmath145 and q(x ) q(x^*)=c_+- q_+(x ) ( q_-(x))^ * + c_-+ q_-(x ) ( q_+(x))^*. with @xmath146 and @xmath147 being some constants .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour ( [ as ] ) of the functions @xmath148 is fixed by the conformal weight of the state and it is not sensitive to the value of `` higher '' quantum numbers @xmath65 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 . to obtain the quantization conditions for @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath64 one has to identify the remaining singularities of the solutions of the baxter equation , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , on the complex @xmath135plane and examine the monodromy of @xmath149 around them .",
    "as an example , let us seek for solutions @xmath107 to the baxter equation within the class of rational functions .",
    "the distinguished property of such solutions is that they have a finite number of poles on the @xmath135plane and scale at infinity as an integer power of @xmath150 .",
    "according to ( [ as ] ) the latter property implies integer values of the conformal weight @xmath22 .",
    "then , straightforward analysis shows that @xmath107 can not have poles on the @xmath135plane , since otherwise in order to balance the both sides of the baxter equation ( [ beq ] ) the functions @xmath107 should have an infinite sequence of poles shifted by @xmath151 along imaginary axis . in similar manner , taking the limit @xmath152 in ( [ beq ] ) one can argue that @xmath107 should vanish at the origin faster then @xmath153 .",
    "these two conditions fix @xmath107 to be a polynomial of degree @xmath154 with @xmath52times degenerate root @xmath155 q_+(x)=x^n _ k=1^h - n(x-_k ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath156 roots of the polynomial , @xmath157 , satisfy the bethe equations and for given @xmath22 they take a discrete set of real values @xcite . substituting this solution back into the baxter equation ( [ beq ] ) and comparing",
    "its both sides one can express quantized @xmath68 in terms of the roots .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath68 takes the form ( [ q - gen ] ) with @xmath95 and @xmath158 and it can be calculated explicitly @xcite .",
    "thus defined polynomial solutions of the baxter equation were first obtained within the algebraic bethe ansatz approach and their properties were studied in detail @xcite .    to find the most general form of the quantization conditions ( [ q - gen ] ) one has to solve the baxter equation ( [ beq ] ) for arbitrary complex conformal weights of the form ( [ h ] ) .",
    "different attempts have been undertaken @xcite , but the analytical solution similar to ( [ pol ] ) is not available at present .",
    "as the first approximation to the exact solution , it has been proposed @xcite to look for the asymptotic solution to the baxter equation by applying the methods of nonlinear wkb analysis well - known from the studies of the painlev type - i equation @xcite .",
    "let us interpret the baxter equation ( [ beq ] ) as a 1-dimensional discretized schrdinger equation on the complex @xmath135line and let us look for its solutions in the form of the wkb expansion .",
    "one observes that the planck constant is formally unity @xmath159 in the baxter equation and the quasiclassical limit corresponds to large values of the `` energies '' @xmath68 entering into the definition ( [ beq ] ) of @xmath160 .",
    "this limit can be effectively performed by introducing an arbitrary small parameter @xmath161 and rescaling the coordinate , @xmath162 , and the quantum numbers , @xmath163 , in ( [ beq ] ) .",
    "then , the asymptotic solution to the baxter equation has the form @xcite q(x/)=(^x",

    "one gets from ( [ u - nu ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) the corresponding value of moduli as @xmath292 for @xmath344 .",
    "let us consider the flow of @xmath268 in both cases in more detail .    for large @xmath26",
    "one uses ( [ u - nu ] ) and ( [ wh - nu ] ) to expand @xmath268 and @xmath248 in inverse powers of @xmath370 u&=&1 ( 1+^-2 + ^-4+^-6+^-8+^-10 + ( ^-12 ) ) + & = & 1 + 92 ^ -2+^-4 + ^-6+^-8+^-10 + ( ^-12 ) .",
    "inverting these relations one obtains the expansion of @xmath268 in powers of @xmath371 , which identically coincides with ( [ delta-1 ] ) .",
    "this means that two different branches of the function @xmath372 corresponding to the whitham flow for @xmath373 and @xmath374 can be smoothly glued at @xmath344 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "for @xmath369 the moduli ( [ u - nu ] ) goes to infinity as u=4(^2 - 3)^-3/2+(^2 - 3)^-1/2+((^2 - 3)^3/2 ) . to find the corresponding behaviour of the flow parameter one takes into account that @xmath344 for @xmath375 and integrates the whitham equation ( [ wh - nu ] ) as @xmath376 replacing the derivative @xmath377 by its expression ( [ wh - nu ] )",

    ", the leading term coincides with ( [ rp ] ) .",
    "the symmetry ( [ sym ] ) allows to extend the flow to large negative @xmath268 as u= ( ^3 - 6 ^ 2 ) , .    summarizing the results of this section we present on fig .",
    "2 the dependence of the quantized moduli @xmath246 on the flow parameter @xmath379 . according to ( [ sym ] ) the moduli @xmath268 is an odd function of @xmath380 .",
    "its asymptotics around @xmath381 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 is described by ( [ delta-1/2 ] ) , ( [ delta-1 ] ) and ( [ del+ ] ) , respectively .",
    "we recall that this curve provides the solution to the quantization conditions ( [ qc3 ] ) and ( [ wh3 ] ) for @xmath1 reggeon compound states .",
    "let us apply the results of the previous section to evaluate the quantum numbers @xmath63 and @xmath65 of the @xmath1 reggeon states in the leading order of the wkb expansion . according to ( [ hol ] ) ,",
    "the values of @xmath65 depend on two complex numbers @xmath384 and @xmath385 . following ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) we consider two special cases , @xmath386 and @xmath387 , corresponding to real values of the moduli and the flow parameters . and @xmath248 for @xmath1 states it is enough to impose even weaker condition : @xmath388 .",
    "] in the case i , the relations ( [ i ] ) and ( [ i+ii ] ) between the moduli and quantized @xmath65 can be written in two equivalent forms q_3=(i)^3 u(),h-12=i,=_1+_2 or q_3=(i_1)^3 u()^-3,h-12=(i_1)^-1,= , with @xmath389 being real . in the case",
    "ii , one gets similar relations by replacing @xmath390 and taking @xmath391 to be integer .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ sym ] ) that @xmath65 is antisymmetric under interchanging of @xmath91 and @xmath392 , while the conformal weight @xmath393 is explicitly symmetric .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 vanishes for @xmath394 and the corresponding @xmath1 reggeon state with the conformal weight @xmath395 is degenerate @xcite .",
    "their wave function does not depend on one of the reggeon coordinates and the corresponding energy is equal to the energy of @xmath38 reggeon state , @xmath396 .",
    "since quantized @xmath65 and @xmath22 depend on the same parameters @xmath91 and @xmath392 one can express @xmath392 in terms of @xmath22 and consider @xmath65 to be a function of the conformal weight @xmath22 and real @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider separately the dependence of @xmath65 on its arguments , @xmath397 .    for fixed values of the conformal weight @xmath398 it is convenient to apply ( [ qq3 ] ) .",
    "one finds that up to rescaling of the argument the @xmath399dependence of @xmath65 is governed by the moduli and it follows the pattern of the curve shown in fig .  2 .    for fixed values of @xmath91",
    "one uses instead ( [ q3 ] ) . introducing notations for @xmath400 and @xmath401",
    "one writes ( [ q3 ] ) as q_3=(i_1)^3q(x),h-12=i_1x , q = x^3 u(1/x ) , with @xmath340 depending on @xmath150 and not on @xmath91 . here , the parameter @xmath91 fixes the scale of @xmath65 and @xmath402 .",
    "it takes real continuous values which can not be however arbitrary small for the leading order wkb approximation to be applicable . in the case",
    "ii one replaces @xmath403 and uses integer @xmath93 to label the curves @xmath404 .",
    "again , the values of @xmath93 can not be small .",
    "the function @xmath405 can be determined out of the curve @xmath246 depicted on fig .  2 in two steps .",
    "one first finds the dependence of moduli @xmath268 on @xmath406 as shown in fig .  3 and then obtains @xmath405 in the form shown in fig .",
    "the following comments are in order . to describe the transition from fig .  2 to fig .  3 one has to take into account that @xmath345 is mapped into infinities @xmath407 and two parts of the continuous function @xmath246 for @xmath408 and @xmath409 give rise to two branches of the functions @xmath268 and @xmath340 on figs .  3 and 4 , respectively",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath340 as @xmath410 follows from ( [ delta-1 ] ) and ( [ sym ] ) q=- , .",
    "two infinities @xmath411 are mapped into the origin @xmath155 .",
    "since @xmath246 has different subleading terms in the asymptotics ( [ del+ ] ) and ( [ del- ] ) , the function @xmath340 has different asymptotics as @xmath150 approaches the origin from different sides ( see fig .",
    "4 ) q= , and q= , it is this property that is responsible for the appearance of a cusp on fig .",
    "4 at @xmath155 and @xmath412 two reference points ( [ ref1 ] ) and ( [ ref2 ] ) correspond to @xmath413 and @xmath414 , respectively , and the asymptotics of @xmath340 at their vicinity can be found from ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ delta-1 ] ) as qq=3 ( x - 2 ) , and q=1 , .",
    "the part of the function @xmath246 corresponding to @xmath415 and @xmath416 describes the polynomial solutions of the baxter equation .",
    "it is mapped into the branch that starts at @xmath417 for @xmath414 on fig .  4 and then decreases to infinity according to ( [ h - infty ] ) as @xmath150 increases .",
    "one checks that this behaviour is an agreement with the numerical results ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to stress that the above results were obtained in the leading order of the wkb expansion and they are valid for large values of quantum numbers . examining fig .  4 and using ( [ q(x ) ] )",
    "one notices that the latter condition is violated at @xmath155 and @xmath413 when either @xmath418 or @xmath65 vanish .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the behaviour of the function @xmath405 close to the cusp on fig .",
    "4 and around the point @xmath419 will be modified by the nonleading wkb corrections .",
    "their detailed analysis deserves further investigation .    concluding our consideration we would like to apply the obtained results to calculate the energy of the @xmath420reggeon states .",
    "the corresponding expression looks like e_3^wkb(q_2,q_3)=-22-_j=1 ^ 3 where @xmath421 and @xmath234 are defined as zeros of @xmath160 @xmath422 one should warn however that , first , this expression was obtained for the type - ii solutions ( [ ii ] ) and , second , it is not exact and is valid in the leading order of the wkb expansion . replacing @xmath423 in ( [ q(x ) ] ) and substituting quantized @xmath63 and @xmath22 into ( [ e3 ] ) one gets @xmath424 as a function of the conformal weight @xmath22 and integer @xmath93 . to get an insight into the spectrum of @xmath425 we plot on fig .  5 the dependence of @xmath425 on the conformal weight @xmath22 for different values of the integer @xmath93 .",
    "these curves are in an agreement with the numerical results of the polynomial solutions ( see fig .  8 in @xcite ) and they support the calculation of the odderon intercept performed in @xcite . for given @xmath93",
    "the energy is maximal for @xmath426 and its value increases as @xmath93 decreases .",
    "the absolute maximum of the energy @xmath427 defines the odderon intercept and it is expecting to occur at @xmath428 and @xmath426 .",
    "one also observes that for the upper curve on fig .  5 the maximal energy , @xmath429 , is close to the lower bound on the odderon energy obtained in the variational approach @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for detailed description of the properties of curves shown on fig .",
    "5 . it would be interesting to improve ( [ e3 ] ) by applying the expression for the energy @xmath425 proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the spectrum of the reggeon compound states in high - energy qcd .",
    "these states appear as solutions of the @xmath3dimensional schrdinger equation ( [ bkp ] ) which exhibits remarkable properties of the @xmath16 invariance and complete integrability . as a result",
    ", the energy of the states can be evaluated as a function of the set of quantum numbers @xmath63 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 .",
    "the latter are defined as eigenvalues of the mutually commuting integrals of motions and their possible values are constrained by the quantization conditions .",
    "we have established the quantization conditions by applying the methods of nonlinear wkb analysis to the @xmath52reggeon schrdinger equation in the separated coordinates . in the leading order of the wkb expansion , the @xmath0",
    "reggeon state looks like the classical system of @xmath0 particles moving on the @xmath430dimensional plane of transverse gluon coordinates along periodic trajectories .",
    "this collective motion can be also considered as a propagation of the soliton wave in the system of @xmath0 reggeons .",
    "the charges @xmath63 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 become parameters of the soliton waves .",
    "the quantization conditions follow from the analysis of the wave function of the @xmath0 reggeon state in the leading order of the wkb expansion . requiring the wave function to be a",
    "single - valued function of the separated coordinates , we have found that the selection rules for @xmath63 , @xmath7 , @xmath64 have the form of the bohr - sommerfeld quantization conditions imposed on the reggeon classical trajectories in the action - angle variables .",
    "the same conditions can be interpreted as whitham equations on the moduli of the spectral curve @xmath170 corresponding to the classical @xmath0 reggeon system .",
    "we have solved the whitham equation for @xmath1 reggeon states by using the properties of the elliptic integrals on the curve @xmath263 .",
    "the quantized @xmath63 and @xmath65 were obtained in the form of perturbative expansion in powers of the jacobi @xmath334parameter of the elliptic curve @xmath263 .",
    "different parts of the spectrum of @xmath63 and @xmath65 correspond to the weak , @xmath431 , and strong , @xmath432 , coupling regime of the perturbative @xmath334series . in the latter case ,",
    "one performs the duality transformation to express @xmath63 and @xmath65 as a weak coupling expansion in the dual coupling constant , @xmath433 . combining together different branches we have obtained the spectrum of quantized @xmath63 and @xmath65 which is in agreement with available exact solutions found within algebraic bethe ansatz approach .    in conclusion",
    ", one should mention that the above consideration was restricted to the leading order wkb expansion and one should additionally study the importance of nonleading corrections . in particular , considering the behaviour of ( [ wkb ] ) around the origin @xmath155 one can argue @xcite that nonleading wkb corrections to @xmath107 become equally important . as in the case of the polynomial solutions , ( [ pol ] ) ,",
    "the analysis of the singularities of the solutions to the baxter equation at @xmath155 should lead to additional constaints on the quantum numbers of the reggeon states and presumably fix the ratio @xmath434 in ( [ ans ] ) .",
    "these questions deserve additional studies .",
    "i would like to thank i.v .",

    "in this appendix we collect some useful properties of the elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "it is defined as @xcite ( z)=_0 ^ 1 = f(;1;z ) with @xmath435 being a hypergeometric function .",
    "for @xmath436 it behaves as ( z)=2 \\{1+(12)^2 z + ( ) ^2 z^2 + ... } and for @xmath437 as ( z ) = -1 ( 1-z ) - 2 ( 1-z ) - 2(1-z)^2 + ... calculating ( [ delta - inf ] ) one uses the relation ( 12 + 4)= .",
    "the jacobi @xmath333 and @xmath340 parameters defined in ( [ tau ] ) have the following asymptotics for @xmath436 ( z ) & = & - ( z+z^2+z^3+z^4 + ( z^5 ) ) + q(z ) & = & ( 1 + 12 z+ z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + ( z^5 ) ) . and their asymptotics for @xmath437 can be found using the relations ( z)=-1(1-z),q(z)= ( ) , which follow from the definition ( [ tau ] ) .",
