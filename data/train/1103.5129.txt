    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides@xcite the copper oxides have been studied intensively by numerous condensed matter experimentalists and theoreticians .",
    "this group of materials shows a rich , unique and interesting temperature - doping phase diagram .",
    "most areas of the phase diagram are not understood clearly yet .",
    "especially , the pseudogap region has been attracted by many researchers because this region might potentially contain the key properties to answer the long standing unsolved ultimate question : the origin of the microscopic glue to form the cooper pairs in the material . in the phase diagram",
    "underdoped material undergoes from the pseudogap state to the superconducting state through only cooling process .",
    "so the two regions should be related very closely to each other .",
    "however , there have been two completely opposite scenarios proposed ; while some believe that the pseudogap supports the superconductivity through preforming electron - electron pairs , others believe that the pseudogap opposes the superconductivity as a competing order parameter .    to investigate the materials in the pseudogap region one should include the pseudogap in his / her model .",
    "pseudogap is a partial reduction in the electronic density of states ( dos ) around the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "recent study@xcite showed that the pseudogap could be extracted from ab - plane optical spectra of underdoped cuprates and proposed a new reliable model for the pseudogap . according to the new pseudogap model the density of states loss in the pseudogap",
    "is recovered just above the pseudogap energy within the energy scale of pseudogap .",
    "we also believe that the boson involved in the electron - boson spectral density function , @xmath8 , is due to spin fluctuations , where @xmath9 is the electron - magnetic boson coupling constant and @xmath10 is the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility , which can be measured directly by inelastic neutron scattering experiment .",
    "we use the eliashberg formalism to obtain the electron - boson interaction from optical spectra , particularly the optical self - energy@xcite .",
    "optically extracted electron - boson spectral density function of underdoped y123-orthoii has been appeared in two references@xcite . in those two references",
    "the authors used a constrained electron - boson spectral density function , which consisted of a sharp gaussian mode with a fixed mode frequency and a broad mmp mode . in one of the two references the authors also applied the new pseudogap model to extract the electron - boson spectral function and got better fits and more reliable results@xcite .    here",
    "we use the new pseudogap model@xcite to extract the electron - boson spectral density from optical spectra of two underdoped copper oxides ( cuprates ) : bi-2212 with @xmath7 = 69 k and y-123 with @xmath7 = 59 k. for this analysis we set the peak position of the sharp mode as a free parameter , i.e. , we impose less constraint on the electron - boson spectral function compared with earlier work@xcite ( i.e. , one more free parameter ) and consequently get better fitting quality . the data and",
    "fits for bi-2212 ( @xmath7 = 69 k ) and y-123 ( @xmath7 = 59 k ) are shown in figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "this new approach gives some interesting and new results .",
    "we observe that the depth ( or strength ) of pseudogap increases almost linearly and the peak in the extracted electron - boson spectral function shifts linearly to lower frequency as temperature decreases .",
    "we estimate a fictitious ( maximum ) superconducting transition temperature @xmath7 using the extracted electron - boson spectral function at measured temperatures and a generalized mcmillan formula@xcite . as a result ,",
    "interestingly , the estimated ( maximum ) @xmath7 decreases with temperature lowering .",
    "from these temperature dependent trends in the pseudogap and the maximum @xmath7 we conclude that the pseudogap may suppress the superconductivity in this material .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a general formalism used for extracting the electron - boson spectral density from the optical self - energy . in the further following sections",
    "we show and discuss about results obtained from our analysis .",
    "using the new approach we analyzed published ab - plane optical spectra of underdoped bi-2212 with @xmath7 = 69 k@xcite and a - axis optical spectra of underdoped y-123 with @xmath7 = 59 k@xcite .",
    "the spectra analyzed were the optical self - energies , which can be defined in an extended drude model formalism as follows@xcite : @xmath11 \\equiv i\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{4\\pi } \\frac{1}{\\omega\\!-\\!2\\sigma^{op}(\\omega , t ) } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the complex optical conductivity , @xmath13 is the complex dielectric function , @xmath14 is the plasma frequency , which is proportional to the number density of charge carriers , @xmath15 is the background dielectric constant at high frequency ( @xmath16 2.0 ev)@xcite , and @xmath17 is the complex optical self - energy . for more detailed discussion and information about @xmath14 and @xmath15",

    "the optical self - energy should be a complex function , @xmath18 , to hold the conditions of causality  @xcite .",
    "this quantity can carry the information of correlation between charge carriers in the material , like the quasiparticle self - energy .",

    "\\equiv \\omega\\lambda(\\omega , t)$ ] , where @xmath20 is the effective mass and @xmath21 is the bare electron mass and @xmath22 is the mass renormalization function . the imaginary part is related to the frequency dependent relaxation time of charge carriers , @xmath23 \\equiv 1/\\tau(\\omega , t)$ ] , where @xmath24 is the optical scattering rate .",
    "the optical self - energy is different from the quasiparticle self - energy , which can be measured by an angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite . the optical self - energy is an averaged quantity over the fermi surface and contains a two - particle process , which is a more complicated quantity than the single - particle process in the quasiparticle self - energy .",
    "the optical scattering rates at normal state for underdoped bi-2212 and y-123 are shown in figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , respectively .        to obtain the electron - boson spectral density function , which shows the interactions between charge carriers more explicitly , we use the integral equations , which relate the optical self - energy to the electron - boson spectral density function , derived by allen@xcite within an eliashberg formalism .",

    "for the numerical analysis at a given temperature we fix the temperature ( @xmath27 ) , the shape and width of the pseudogap and the shape of the electron - boson density function ( as shown in figure [ fig0 ] ) and have five free fitting parameters : the pseudogap intensity ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) and the two mode frequencies ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and the two mode intensities ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) of the sharp and mmp modes in @xmath8 .",

    "we note here that the pseudogap and the sharp peak give different line shapes to the optical scattering rates even though the sharp increase in the scattering rate near 600 @xmath36 comes from positive contributions of both the pseudogap and the sharp mode @xcite .",
    "so we can obtain the pseudogap strength and the sharp mode frequency separately from the analysis .",
    "we will discuss this issue more in detail later in the section . in the lower panel of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the resulting electron - boson spectral density function at various temperatures .",

    "the peak is softened linearly from 370 to 185 @xmath36 as temperature decreases from 295 to 70 k. this is a similar temperature dependent trend of the sharp mode in the electron - boson density of optimally doped bi-2212 , which has been reported in a reference.@xcite ( see figure 2d in the reference ) .",

    "we also display the estimated temperature dependent @xmath50.,width=364 ]    we display @xmath50 at various temperatures in the inset of the middle panel of figure [ fig2 ] . since as temperature decreases the peak position shifts to lower frequency the averaged boson frequency , @xmath63 also deceases . even though @xmath62 increases the resulting @xmath50 decreases as lowering temperature as shown in the inset .",
    "we will discuss this issue more in detail in the following paragraph . at our lowest temperature @xmath69 71 k , which is pretty close to the actual @xmath7 ,",
    "69 k. the peak position of the sharp mode and @xmath67 show a positive correlation ; both decrease as temperature is lowered , roughly @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath67 is also pretty sensitive to the intensity of the electron - boson density near zero frequency . to demonstrate it we perform the same numerical analysis for underdoped bi-2212 at @xmath27 = 70 k with a different electron - boson spectral density model described by the equation below ; in this model there is a ( spin ) gap in the electron - boson density spectrum .",
    "the width of the gap is 100 @xmath36 . @xmath71",
    "the quality of fit is still pretty good ( not shown ) .",
    "we estimate a new @xmath67 by using the generalized mcmillan equation and new resulting electron - boson spectral function and get a higher @xmath67 , 98 k ; it is increased from 71 k to 98 k by 38 % .",
    "the stronger pseudogap means that the pseudogap gives effectively the more reduction in the optical scattering rate near zero frequency ( i.e. , the fermi surface ) by reducing the more electronic density of states near the fermi surface . to see the pseudogap effect on the scattering rate more clearly we calculate two @xmath72 using the same extracted @xmath8 of bi-2212 at @xmath27 = 70 k with two different pseudogap depthes , @xmath51 = 0.080 and 0.792",
    "the figure [ fig2a ] shows results of the calculations .",
    "we can see that the deeper ( i.e. , stronger ) pseudogap gives effectively the higher onset scattering edge even though we have the same peak position in @xmath8 and the same width of the pseudogap . in fact , both the pseudogap and the sharp peak position contribute positively to the onset frequency in the optical scattering rate ; both make the onset frequency larger@xcite .",
    "so for a given onset scattering edge if we have the stronger pseudogap we would have the lower peak position .",
    "we observe that there is a negative correlation between the strength of the pseudogap and @xmath67(t ) , i.e. , as temperature decreases while the pseudogap is getting stronger , the maximum superconducting temperature @xmath50 is getting lower . as we have discussed previously the stronger pseudogap causes effectively the lower peak position of @xmath8 .",
    "so as lowering temperature since the pseudogap strength is getting stronger the peak position shifts to lower frequency .",
    "consequently the averaged boson frequency , @xmath63 deceases .",
    "it is clear that the pseudogap gives a negative effect on @xmath50 by shifting the sharp mode to lower frequency through the generalized mcmillan formalism . on the other hand",
    "the coupling strength , @xmath62 , increases as temperature decreases ( see the bottom panel of figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , in spite of the increase of the coupling strength , @xmath62 , the resulting @xmath50 decreases as lowering temperature .",
    "this result seems somewhat counterintuitive .",
    "however , we may be able to understand the behavior as follows : two contributions from the pseudogap and the coupling compete against each other and the temperature dependent effect of the pseudogap on @xmath50 seems to be larger than that of the coupling strength . in other words",
    ", for a given amount of temperature reduction the negative contribution of the pseudogap to @xmath67(t ) is larger than the positive contribution of the coupling strength ; the pseudogap possibly suppresses the superconductivity in the material .",
    "we should note that we consider only the fictitious maximum @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath65 = 1 ) to get the conclusion . for a real material",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is unknown .",
    "as @xmath65 increases the coupling strength effect on @xmath50 is getting stronger .",
    "when @xmath73 0.40 the two contributions become the same for @xmath74 70 k and below the value the coupling strength effect is larger than the pseudogap effect .",
    "@xmath65 is an important parameter for the discussion above .",
    "we performed the same numerical analysis for our underdoped y-123 with @xmath7 = 59 k. we display the results of analysis in figure [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "the over all temperature dependent trends are very similar to those of bi-2212 described previously .",
    "the peak position decreases almost linearly as temperature decreases as shown in the inset of the lower panel of figure[fig3 ] .",
    "we compare the temperature dependent peak position in the electron - boson spectral function with that in the imaginary part of the local ( @xmath75 averaged ) magnetic susceptibility of underdoped y-123 with @xmath7 = 52 k obtained by an inelastic neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "we superimpose the two sets of the temperature dependent peak positions from both our optical and the neutron studies in the inset of the lower panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "interestingly , those two peaks agree almost perfectly in terms of energy scale and temperature dependence .",
    "this good agreement supports the proposal that the electron - boson density of cuprates has a magnetic origin , which would be the spin fluctuations@xcite . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we can see that the pseudogap depth , @xmath76 , is getting deeper as temperature decreases . the total spectral weight and the mass renormalization factor increase with similar temperature dependent trends as we observed in underdoped bi-2212 system .",
    "@xmath50 at all temperatures are higher than the actual @xmath7 , 59 k ; @xmath77 at our lowest temperature is 82 k , which is the lowest @xmath67 and about 40 % higher than the actual @xmath7= 59 k. we also see a positive correlation between @xmath50 and the peak position in @xmath0 but with a different proportionality , @xmath78 .",
    "we note that this and previous relationships between the peak position and @xmath67 is similar to the well - known relationship between the magnetic resonance mode frequency and @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath79 from inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",

    "it is not easy to determine uniquely the electron - boson density function from a given spectrum with a similar level of fitting quality@xcite .",
    "however , those all different numerical methods give qualitatively similar results ; the electron - boson density can be described by a couple of components .",
    "those components are a temperature and doping dependent sharp mode , which is localized at low frequencies , and a relatively much less temperature and doping dependent broad mode , which spreads in a wide spectral range , up to 400 mev ( 3200 @xmath36 ) or higher . in our investigation using the new pseudogap model@xcite we extracted the electron - boson spectral density function at various temperatures above @xmath7 from the optical self - energy of two underdoped cuprates : bi-2212 and y-123 .",
    "the two different cuprates show common temperature dependent properties .",
    "the extracted electron - boson density function of underdoped cuprates shows a qualitatively different frequency dependence from those of optimally doped and overdoped cuprates@xcite .",
