    "spontaneous formation of spatially periodic structures on a homogeneous background is ubiquious in nature , fascinating to look at , and often hard to understand in detail .",
    "the periodic structures are almost never ideal .",
    "irregularities may be generated in the transient after the pattern formation is initiated and anneal after some time . or , in particular in dissipative systems far from equilibrium",
    ", they may be the result of an instability of the regular , spatially periodic state itself , then often leading to a state which exhibits persistent spatio - temporally chaotic dynamics . in some systems",
    "this is the case arbitrary close to the threshold of pattern formation in control parameter space . with the help of reduced descriptions like phase - diffusion and ginzburg - landau like amplitude equations , which are to some extent universal ( i.e. , independent of physical details ) , several phenomena associated with these deviations from the simple periodic structure",
    "can be explained @xcite .    for mostly practical reasons , experimental and theoretical research on pattern formation and dynamics",
    "has concentrated on quasi one- or two - dimensional systems , but most of the results obtained should have a direct correspondence also in genuinely three dimensional patterns . by a genuinely three dimensional pattern ( below simply 3d pattern )",
    "i do here mean a spatially periodic structure for which ( i ) the spatial period(s ) are _ not _ determined by the spatial extension of the sample ( referred to as the class of patterns formed by `` competing interaction '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) _ and _ ( ii ) for which the spatial extension of the sample is in all directions large compared to the period(s ) of the pattern .",
    "this is a stronger conception of a `` 3d pattern '' than the one used in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based only on ( ii ) .",
    "additional complications in 3d patterns , as compared to 1d or 2d patterns , arise from the structure and dynamics of defects ( dislocations as well as disclinations ) , which are point like in 2d but line like in 3d . the implications for dissipative , nonpotential systems , mainly those described by the complex ginzburg - landau equation , have been addressed by several authors @xcite .",
    "but there is another particularity of 3d patterns , which has so far found little attention : the massive occurrence of _ homogeneous soft modes _ , which couple to the pattern and can drastically change its dynamics .    by homogeneous soft modes",
    "i mean marginally stable or slowly decaying homogeneous or long - wavelength perturbations of the homogeneous basic state from which the pattern arises . in the abstract sense of the word , they are hydrodynamic modes of the basic state .",
    "but for the sake of clarity the terms `` hydrodynamic mode '' and `` hydrodynamics '' shall here be reserved for slowly relaxing deviations from the _ thermodynamic _ equilibrium in an unbounded , homogeneous medium , and their dynamics ( e.g. , the velocity field in a convective flow is a hydrodynamic variable ) .",
    "the pattern - forming basic state is itself a non - equilibriums state .",
    "thus , although there is some correspondence between homogeneous soft modes and hydrodynamic modes ( in the narrow sense ) , the notions are not identical .    as it has become clear by the investigation of several 1d and 2d model systems , homogeneous soft modes are the key for understanding many of the phenomena occurring at , or close to , the onset of pattern formation .",
    "the most prominent example is the mode associated with a homogeneous perturbation of the pressure field in rayleigh - bnard convection which leads to a `` singular mean flow '' .",
    "it is worth noticing that , since it is usually possible to construct self - consistent amplitude equations which do _ not _ include the effect of homogeneous soft modes , their relevance is easily underestimated in the theoretical analysis .    in 1d and 2d pattern - forming systems ,",
    "most hydrodynamic modes are damped by the boundaries enclosing the system .",
    "for example , momentum and heat can usually diffuse freely through the boundaries and are stabilized by large external reservoirs .",
    "obviously , this mechanism is ineffective in systems which are extended in all three spatial dimensions . on the other hand , some coupling to a reservoir",
    "will also be required in 3d in order to sustain non - equilibrium pattern formation .",
    "this could be through electromagnetic fields , some matrix embedding the active , pattern - forming medium , or some chemical reactant provided in excess .",
    "but the couplings to the reservoirs are highly specific in these cases and stabilize only a few hydrodynamic variables . the remaining fields",
    "do then lead to homogeneous soft modes .",
    "_ as a result , several homogeneous soft modes should be considered as the rule in 3d , pattern - forming systems . _    for example",
    ", when studying the 3d structures formed by chemical waves in the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction , the dynamics of the plain bz reagent does also involve convective fluid motion .",
    "since these hydrodynamic modes are usually considered to be a nuisance , they are suppressed by embedding the reagent in a gel @xcite .",
    "but another homogeneous soft mode excited by the pattern , the temperature field ( gradients of which are probably driving the convection ) remains .",
    "since temperature gradients have a strong influence on the dynamics of the pattern @xcite , a complete description of the 3d bz reaction should explicitly involve this mode .",
    "the work presented here is a case study of 3d pattern formation in the dielectric regime of electroconvection ( ec ) in nematic liquid crystals .",
    "the system was chosen because of its easy experimental accessibility .",
    "in particular , the electric nature of the instability allows to obtain patterns with several hundred periods extension in cells of a fingernail s size , evolving on the time scale of seconds . a closely related variant , the conduction regime of ec , which always leads to quasi 2d patterns , is currently one of the best understood experimental pattern - forming systems , on the phenomenological as well as on the quantitative level ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these advantages compensate the inconvenience of dealing with rather complicated ( electro-)hydrodynamic equations .    rather than trying to understand the complex pattern dynamics itself , this paper is mainly devoted to the development of consistent reduced descriptions of the dynamics .",
    "section  [ sec : dielectric ] sketches the experimental phenomenon and the hydrodynamics of dielectric ec , emphasizing its 3d nature .",
    "approximations used for an analytic or semi - analytic description of dielectric ec are introduced in section  [ sec : linear ] , thereby discussing the linear stability problem . in section  [ sec : ddd ] the 3d amplitude formalism for dielectric ec is derived .",
    "close to the threshold of ec and in a liquid - crystal slab of large but finite thickness , the pattern dynamics becomes essentially 2d .",

    "@xcite .      in the typical experiment a nematic liquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy is sandwiched between a pair of transparent , parallel electrodes ( separation @xmath1 , area @xmath2 ) . by a special treatment of the electrode surfaces ,",
    "the nematic director @xmath3 ( the locally averaged molecular orientation ; @xmath4 ) is forced to align parallel to the electrodes in some preferred direction which shall here be identified with the @xmath5-direction ( @xmath6 be normal to the electrodes , @xmath7 normal to @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "an ac voltage @xmath8 is applied at the electrodes . in the _ conduction regime _ at frequencies below the _ cut - off frequency _ @xmath9 , the first instability to be observed as the voltage is increased is towards a pattern of convection rolls called williams domains @xcite .    at higher frequencies a different kind of structure periodic along @xmath5 is found .",
    "compared to williams domains it has shorter wavelength and decays faster after switching of the voltage ( fast turnoff mode ) .",
    "at least two concurring mechanisms have been proposed for this high frequency mode : the _ dielectric ec _ @xcite , which depends essentially on the anisotropy of the nematic ( its threshold diverges at the nematic - isotropic phase transition @xcite ) , and the _ isotropic mechanism _",
    "@xcite where the liquid crystal s anisotropy is not essential for the convection mechanism itself but only for selecting a preferred modulation direction .",
    "it has a finite threshold at the nematic - isotropic phase transition as its characteristic signature @xcite .",
    "the two linear modes have the same symmetry and do in principle mix , but generally the corresponding thresholds can be assumed to be sufficiently separated to consider the mechanisms isolatedly .",
    "the isotropic mode is thought to be located mainly near the electrodes , while the dielectric mode is maximal at mid plane .",
    "unfortunately , it is not always clear which mode is actually observed . at least in some cases the dielectric mode could be identified by the good match of the threshold curve with theoretical predictions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the isotropic mechanisms will not be considered here .    for voltages slightly higher than the threshold of dielectric ec , the formation of the _ chevron _ superstructure",
    "is observed : defects ( dislocations ) in the pattern of convection rolls accumulate along lines oriented in @xmath7 direction , such that the topological charge of the defects alternates from line to line . between the lines ,",
    "the convection rolls are rotated and the nematic director is twisted , alternately clock- and counterclockwise @xcite .",
    "the observation of chevron patterns in the conduction regime of ec with homeotropic director alignment @xcite shows that this scenario is not restricted to a particular convection mechanism .",
    "ec in both the conduction and the dielectric regime result from the interaction of electric field , space charges , mass flow , and the nematic director _ via _ the carr - helfrich @xcite mechanism : spatial modulations of the director orientation are amplified by an inhomogeneous mass flow generated by electric volume forces on space charges which accumulate due to inhomogeneous electric currents in the inhomogeneous director field .",
    "thus maxwell s equations ( in the quasi - static approximation @xmath10 ) and the balance equations for charge , momentum , mass ( continuity equation ) , and the torque acting on @xmath11 have to be taken into account .",
    "they contain several material parameters : the conductivities @xmath12 for electric currents parallel ( @xmath13 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath14 ) to @xmath3 respectively ( they vary on a large range depending on purity and doping , while @xmath15 changes only little ) , the dielectric constants is absorbed into @xmath16 and @xmath17 . ]",
    "@xmath18 ( the quantities @xmath19 , @xmath20 measure their anisotropies ) , the flexoelectric constants @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , the diffusion constants for ( ionic ) charge carriers @xmath24 , the mass density @xmath25 , the five independent viscosities @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , and the curvature elasticities of the director field @xmath32 .",
    "i also include the `` dynamic flexoelectric effect '' , which was predicted @xcite on the basis of a systematic rederivation of nematohydrodynamics , but , to the authors knowledge , has not been detected , yet .",
    "it is characterized by a parameter @xmath33 and leads to additional dissipative contributions in the charge , momentum , and torque balance equations .      with the exception of the charge relaxation time",
    "@xmath34 the nematohydrodynamic equations ( without external fields ) , being derived as a limit of large time and length scales ( though typically valid down to molecular scales ) , do not set any time or length scale by themselves .",
    "instead , one finds basically three types of diffusivities : for charge ( @xmath35 ) , director orientation [ e.g. @xmath36 for static , @xmath37 for dynamic deformations ; notice that ( static ) flexoelectric effects do not introduce a new diffusive scale since @xmath38 , and momentum [ e.g.  @xmath39 along @xmath3 ] .",
    "the overdamped limit @xmath41 , @xmath42 is generally a good approximation .",
    "charge diffusion is not essential for the carr - helfrich mechanism and is typically screened out .",
    "then orientational diffusion sets the only diffusive scale .    with an externally generated electric ac field",
    "@xmath43 two additional time scales are introduced : the period @xmath44 and the `` director time '' @xmath45 [ the more intuitive choice @xmath46 would suggest that @xmath47 is singular for ec , which is , for the convective modes themselves , not the case ] .    in the conduction regime",
    "the charge densities oscillate with the frequency of the applied field , while the director orientation is mostly constant .",
    "this imposes a condition @xmath48 on the three time scales .",
    "the finite sample thickness @xmath49 determines the wavelength @xmath50 of the convection pattern and leads through a condition @xmath51 to a voltage threshold @xmath52 for the onset of convection ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a good analytic formula ) .",
    "a lower limit for the sample thickness is given _ via _ relation  ( [ cond - range ] ) by @xmath53 . at frequencies",
    "higher then the cutoff frequency @xmath54 the conduction mechanism is also disabled or at least supersede by the dielectric mode .    in the dielectric regime director and fluid flow",
    "oscillate with @xmath55 , which leads to a condition @xmath56 the charge distribution is at high enough frequencies ( @xmath57 ) mostly constant in time .",
    "this is not actually necessary for the dielectric mechanism to be effective @xcite , but typically dielectric ec is supersede by the conductive mode at lower @xmath55 .",
    "the threshold for the onset of ec is now given by a condition @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) , i.e. , the lowest @xmath60 compatible with relation  ( [ diel - range ] ) .",
    "the wavelength @xmath50 of the critical mode can under some conditions be @xmath61 @xcite , but for typical materials used it is @xmath62 , at least as long as this length is smaller than @xmath49 and larger than the debye screening length @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 , where charge diffusion becomes important .",
    "thus , the length scales given by the spatial period of the pattern @xmath50 and the sample thickness @xmath49 are usually independent and easily separated ( @xmath65 ) in the dielectric regime , either by increasing @xmath49 or by simultaneously increasing @xmath55 and the conductivities , while leaving the secondary control parameter @xmath66 constant . since strong doping may affect the nematic material parameters and the nematodynamics at high frequencies is not fully understood , the program carried out below is best seen as the _ limit of thick cells_. the theory should accurately describe typical experiments in cells with @xmath67 . to observe fully three dimensional patterns ,",
    "thicker cells might be required ( see also section  [ sec : transitions ] ) .",
    "below we will develop the amplitude formalism for the pattern dynamics in the dielectric regime , i.e. , obtain the laws of motion of amplitude and phase of the spatial modulations as described by the complex pattern amplitudes @xmath68 or @xmath69 , respectively .    the basic state in the experimental cell is anisotropic and inversion symmetric and the primary bifurcation is supercritical ( forward ) towards a steady - state pattern with a single critical wave vector .",
    "hence , the most elementary description of the pattern dynamics is give by the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation in 2d , @xmath70 important physical properties of which are reviewed in refs .",
    "the real , positive coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 have magnitudes corresponding to natural scales of the system ( e.g.  the pattern wavelength for @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) and can be calculated from the underlying hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the small , dimensionless parameter @xmath75 measures the distance from the threshold of pattern formation in the control - parameter space of the underlying system .",
    "it will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : dd ] that , as a direct consequence of the separation of length scales in the dielectric regime , the range of validity of eq .",
    "( [ rgle ] ) is highly restricted . already for values of @xmath75 of the order @xmath76 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ rgle ] ) must be taken into account .",
    "for @xmath77 the 2d description breaks down completely .",
    "but the convective dynamics can then still be described in terms of the 3d modulations of the complex pattern amplitude @xmath69 ( defined by eq .",
    "( [ normalize ] ) below ) , which is coupled nonlinearly to several homogeneous soft modes .",
    "it is therefore natural to derive first the 3d amplitude dynamics which can then be reduced further to a 2d description in a subsequent step .",
    "julien , knobloch , and tobias @xcite were the first to implement the idea of deriving a reduced description for the @xmath6-dependence of the amplitude of patterns with @xmath78 as an intermediate step in the theory , and also the first to observe that this method significantly eases the restriction of the control parameter to values close to threshold .",
    "their calculation do , however , not involve in - plane modulations of the pattern and the resulting excitation of homogeneous soft modes .",
    "several results concerning the 3d description of dielectric ec and its reduction to 2d are derived in an unpublished work by lindner @xcite , which is quoted here whenever necessary .",
    "the starting point for setting up the 3d amplitude equations is to calculate the linear threshold @xmath79 , critical wave number @xmath80 and critical eigenvector ( i.e. , the @xmath81-periodic time dependence of the hydrodynamic fields at threshold ) ignoring any spatial variations along @xmath6 .",
    "several linear stability calculations of this type have been carried out @xcite .    in experiments ,",
    "the critical wave vector is always found to be parallel to the orientation of the nematic director in the basic state ( the @xmath5 direction ) .",
    "the linear problem is thus effectively one - dimensional , with trivial , sinusoidal variations along the remaining @xmath5 direction , and is much easier to solve than the 2d problem including variations and boundary conditions along @xmath6 .",
    "this technical advantage of the 3d approach , which is of course not restricted to ec , remains effective also in the subsequent calculations of the coupling coefficients in the 3d amplitude equation .    for analytic as well as numerical calculations",
    "it is convenient to use a truncated fourier expansion of the time dependences of the hydrodynamic fields , assuming them to be @xmath81 periodic . in the simplest cases truncated at lowest order ( i.e. , including constant and @xmath82/@xmath83 contributions ) @xcite or including the @xmath82/@xmath84 modulation of the induced electric potential in order to better model the interplay between electric charges and fields . with these truncations , the stability problem for sinusoidal excitation",
    "can be solved explicitly ( see appendix  [ sec : coefficients ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that this `` lowest order '' or , respectively , `` second lowest order fourier approximation '' involves some arbitrariness in the choice of variables and does not correspond to any physical limit .",
    "numerical convergence ( @xmath85 accuracy ) requires inclusion of at least the third harmonic .",
    "the actual time dependence of , e.g. , the director field , depends on @xmath55 and is non - trivial even as @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "some results presented here rely on the first or second lowest order fourier expansion of the induced electric potential @xmath87 , the nematic director expressed by @xmath88 and @xmath89 such that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , the velocity field @xmath92 , and the pressure @xmath93 .",
    "the other hydrodynamic fields are treated implicitly . for the representation of the dielectric mode itself ,",
    "@xmath92 is expressed in the divergence - free form @xmath94 and the pressure is eliminated .    as a natural consequence of @xmath58 ,",
    "the relative phases of electric , director and velocity fields in the linear eigenvector are shifted by angles @xmath95 .",
    "remarkably , the phase shift between the lowest fourier mode of director oscillations and external field is @xmath96 , for the first @xcite and second - lowest - order fourier approximation ( see appendix  [ sec : coefficients ] ) exactly and only slightly perturbed ( @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) when higher fourier modes are included .",
    "no simple physical explanation for this result should be expected , since it holds only at the critical ( most unstable ) wavenumber .",
    "experimental observations @xcite seem to agree with a value @xmath96 for the phase shift even better than the comparison with galerkin calculations including @xmath6-dependence @xcite , which had been carried out as a test of the dielectric model of ec .",
    "we define the pattern amplitude @xmath99 such that the amplitude @xmath100 of the @xmath83 fourier component of the director tilt oscillations ( which is in phase with the applied voltage ) has a spatial dependence @xmath101    assuming as usual @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 to be small and discarding contributions beyond the lowest nontrivial order , the linear part of the 3d amplitude equation assumes the form @xmath106 as conventional , @xmath107 .",
    "the coherence lengths @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath108 turn out to be  @xmath109 and the relaxation time @xmath71 is of the order of the charge relaxation time @xmath110 @xcite ( s. appendix  [ sec : coefficients ] ) .",
    "the horizontal boundary conditions for @xmath99 are simply @xmath111 contributions from derivatives of @xmath99 and nonlinear contributions to the boundary conditions are of higher order and can be discarded . in particular , as is well known , the distinction between free and no - slip boundary conditions for the velocity field plays no role at this point . with the realistic no - slip boundary conditions for the velocities , the relative magnitude of the hydrodynamic fields in the 2d linear eigenvector ( including @xmath5 and @xmath6 variations ) locally deviates from the 1d eigenvector ( only @xmath5 variation ) only in a boundary layer of thickness @xmath109 , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : randschicht ] .",
    "this boundary layer might provide a problem for numerical approaches directly using 2d eigenvectors in thick cells with no - slip boundaries , notably when galerkin approximations are used .",

    "( [ rgle ] ) ] with a critical mode @xmath115 .",
    "the small threshold shift @xmath116 due to the @xmath6-variation is rather uninteresting by itself ( there is also a shift @xmath117 in @xmath80 by a discarded contribution to eq .",
    "( [ 3da ] ) of the form @xmath118 ) , but the effect provides , for example , a simple interpretation of the small gap ( @xmath119 ) between the critical mode and the lowest @xmath6-antisymmetric mode ( i.e.  @xmath120 ) reported in @xcite .",
    "a short remark about flexoelectric effects , which are generally difficult to isolate experimentally , is in place at this point .",
    "the high symmetry of the linear problem in 3d does not allow flexoelectric effects : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are independent of the flexoelectric coefficients .",
    "most of the remaining linear and nonlinear coefficients contain flexoelectric contributions . with our choice of variables",
    "these contributions are , except for some dynamic - flexoelectric terms , all indirect : flexoelectric effects excite additional , `` slaved '' contributions in the subspace orthogonal to the critical eigenvector , which , again by flexoelectric effects , feed back into the dynamics of the amplitude of the eigenvector . in contrast , the contributions not depending on flexoelectric coefficients are , except for @xmath121 , all direct : no excitation of slaved degrees of freedom is involved .",
    "therefore _ flexoelectric effects are separated in a natural way _ from the standard dynamics .",
    "this might provide methods for measuring the flexoelectric coefficients in a way not sensitive to parasitic boundary effects .",
    "previous calculations involving flexoelectric effects @xcite where restricted to the conventional , `` static '' flexoelectric contributions and concentrated on the determination of critical mode and voltage .",
    "before discussing the homogeneous soft modes relevant for dielectric ec , some comments on methodology are required .",
    "multiple homogeneous soft modes excited by a patterning mode have , to my knowledge , first been introduced by plaut and pesch @xcite . but",
    "their description requires the soft - mode amplitudes to be constant along all but one spatial direction .",
    "this limitation seems to be partly due to the procedure by which the equations were derived .",
    "there are two popular philosophies for this procedure ( see below and appendix  [ sec : methods ] ) , which shall here be labeled as `` order parameter '' method and `` center manifold '' method .",
    "the two methods usually ( for at most one homogeneous soft mode ) differ only in the way in which the problem is formulated and solved , but lead to the same results .",
    "the association of existing general prescriptions for deriving amplitude equations with the former ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the latter philosophy ( e.g.  @xcite , the chapman - enskog approach @xcite for the derivation of hydrodynamics from statistical mechanics is also of this type , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) is therefore not always conclusive ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "when using the `` order parameter '' method to obtain reduced equations , each spatial fourier mode of the physical state is projected onto the ( adjoint ) slowly decaying linear eigenmodes of the basic state _ with the corresponding wave vector_. using the `` center manifold '' method , the projection is always onto the ( adjoint ) eigenvectors for ( typically neutrally stable ) _ homogeneous perturbations_. when there are multiple slow modes at a single wave vector ( usually @xmath122 ) , the resulting reduced equations differ , as is shown in appendix  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "plaut and pesch  @xcite seem to be using the `` order parameter '' method , which leads to problems in more than one spatial dimension . here , the `` center manifold '' method is used to derive the nonlinear extensions of the amplitude equation  ( [ 3da ] ) including homogeneous soft modes .",
    "some particularities of the problem under consideration have to be taken into account : the quasi - static approximation of electrodynamics @xmath123 and the approximation of an incompressible fluid @xmath124 both lead to additional homogeneous `` soft modes '' : since no time derivatives of electric potential ( electric field ) or pressure occur in the basic equations as they are used here , all their temporal fourier modes are in the kernel of the linear operator @xmath125 ( s. appendix  [ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "when the viscid limit @xmath41 becomes effective , the same applies for the oscillating part of the velocity field .",
    "this is the case when spatial variations occur on scales smaller than @xmath126 .",
    "formally we shall assume length scales to be larger than this .",
    "but , since , at least in this case , velocity and pressure oscillations do not feed back into the remaining dynamics at lowest order in the derivatives , i.e. , there are no contributions @xmath127 , the description should be good also on smaller scales .    to simplify the problem further , the equations for the soft modes are here calculated only in the lowest order fourier approximation .",
    "the `` slaved ''",
    "modes being eliminated are then the slowly varying average director tilt @xmath88 , which is stabilized by the applied electric field through the dielectric anisotropy @xmath128 ( assumed to be negative hereafter ) , and oscillations of the director , which are viscously damped .",
    "finally , in anticipation of corresponding boundary conditions , only small deviations from the basic state @xmath129 shall be considered for now .    in order to obtain a consistent truncation of the soft - mode equations ,",
    "recall that the only non - diffusive scale in the hydrodynamic equations is the charge relaxation time @xmath110 .",
    "assume @xmath66 to be fixed .",
    "this also determines @xmath130 for given @xmath110 and we will assume @xmath131 .",
    "the elimination the fast modes ( @xmath88 and oscillations of @xmath3 ) becomes more efficient when @xmath55 and @xmath60 increase or , respectively , @xmath110 decreases .",
    "then , in the limit of small @xmath110 ( or large @xmath132 , with fixed @xmath15 ) , the time scale @xmath110 drops out of the equations . a purely diffusive scaling for the derivatives ( @xmath133 ) is retained , without making any _ a priori _ assumptions about the actual scaling laws of typical lengths and times , which may be different .",
    "this approximation breaks down when length scales become shorter than @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "it turns out that with these approximations the only _ relevant _ modes in the fast subspace ( i.e.  @xmath136 in appendix  [ sec : cmmethod ] ) are @xmath88 and its temporal modulations as given by @xmath137 the electric potential has been decomposed as @xmath138 .",
