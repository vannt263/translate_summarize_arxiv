    "from the platonic solids to @xmath0-cubes , @xmath0-cross - polytopes and regular @xmath0-simplices , convex polytopes as geometric objects have been a source of study since antiquity . indeed , ` the universe can not be read until we have learned the language in which it is written .",

    "a celebrated feature of these convex geometrical figures has been the symmetry they possess . in micro - biology where objects use the efficiency of symmetry to propagate themselves to the study of genetics where symmetry communicates genetic information ,",
