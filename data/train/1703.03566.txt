    "the thermal hall conductivity @xmath112 is not symmetric with respect to the sign of @xmath74 in contrast to the pure @xmath75-case .",
    "switching on @xmath74 leads to a decrease of @xmath112 depending on the direction of the magnetic field @xmath74 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath112 with respect to @xmath74 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal_hall_hx](b ) .",
    "the curve contains a maximum and a minimum that indicate the phase transition as in the case of a pure @xmath75 field .",
    "these observations are hints that a phase transition is anchored with a change of the curvature of @xmath112 .    to complete the picture",
    ", the thermal hall conductivity @xmath112 is shown as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal_hall_3d](a ) .",
    "the largest values for @xmath112 are located on the @xmath75-axis as expected since turning on @xmath74 leads inevitably to the trivial phase .",
    "the 3d - plot reveals the point symmetry of @xmath112 at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the limiting cases of pure magnetic fields in @xmath4- and @xmath49-direction are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : thermal_hall_3d](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the case of a pure @xmath49-dield shows a non - smooth function due to the fact that the bands are not well isolated .",
    "this creates numerical inaccuracies leading to a non - smooth behavior and so the abrupt changes of the curvature do not correspond to phase transitions .",
    "nevertheless , it shows a finite thermal hall conductivity which is significantly smaller than for the pure @xmath4-field case .     as a function of @xmath75 and @xmath74 at @xmath119 using the triplon band structure from second - order perturbation theory at @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath98 .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) show the limiting cases of a magnetic field pointing in one direction . ]",
    "in this work we have investigated an extended shastry - sutherland model which is the relevant microscopic model for the frustrated quantum magnet srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "we have used perturbative continuous unitary transformations about the isolated dimer limit to derive high - order series expansions for the one - triplon band structure in various couplings including a general uniform magnetic field as well as intra- and inter - dimer dm interactions .",
    "the main motivation of our study was to extract the non - trivial topological properties of the triplon band structure for a general uniform magnetic field extending the investigation of ref .   where a field in @xmath4-direction has been considered .",
    "although our scheme is limited to intermediate ratios @xmath123 due to the perturbative nature of our series expansion , the qualitative findings are expected to be of relevance for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "we find that a magnetic field in the @xmath80-plane does not induce any non - trivial chern number into the one - triplon band structure .",
    "in contrast , if the field has a finite component in @xmath4-direction and a finite component in the @xmath80-plane , then the sequence of chern numbers and topological phase transitions is richer compared to the pure @xmath4-case . in the latter the system can be effectively described by a spin - one in a momentum - dependent magnetic field .",
    "the band structure consists of three bands which can have chern numbers @xmath3 and @xmath110 . in the more general case where",
    "also a finite @xmath80-component is present , the chern numbers of the three multibands can be @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath110 .",
    "this is the most important finding of our work .    in the future it would be interesting to extend our calculations to larger values of @xmath123 so that a quantitative modelling of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 can be achieved . to this end one should go beyond our perturbative treatment and apply non - perturbative variants of continuous unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the one - triplon band structure , we have also calculated the thermal hall effect of triplons along the lines of ref .  .",
    "the involved approximations are only valid at low temperatures , since triplon - triplon interactions as well as the hardcore constraint have been neglected . a more consistent calculation including these effects are certainly much more challenging , but also very interesting which we leave open for future research .",
