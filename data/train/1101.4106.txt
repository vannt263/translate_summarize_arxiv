    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are very efficient in forming close binary systems and their decedents such as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , cataclysmic variables , and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the high stellar encounter rate of gcs facilitates the formation of these binary systems through dynamical interactions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the presence of much stronger x - ray emitters can contaminate the x - ray observations of msps .",
    "@xcite reported a number of msps in the galactic field using data obtained using the fermi gamma - ray telescope . because msps are the only known steady @xmath0-ray sources in gcs , @xmath0-ray observations serve as an alternative channel in studying the underlying msp populations in gcs .",

    "such sensitivity has enabled the discovery of @xmath0-rays from 8 gcs  @xcite , including 47  tucanae  @xcite and terzan  5  @xcite . from the known @xmath0-ray luminosity of individual msps in the galactic field  @xcite , they would not be detected at distances of several kpc .",
    "it is therefore believed that the @xmath0-rays from gcs do not come from individual msp , but from a population of msps .",

    "* ) , @xmath0-rays up to a few gev is radiated from the msps through curvature radiation . on the other hand , inverse compton ( ic )",
    "processes resulted from energetic particles up - scattering low - energy photons , such as starlight and infrared light , may give rise to @xmath0-rays of mev to tev energies  @xcite .",

    "we speculate that there is a population of msps  the only known steady @xmath0-ray emitters in gcs  in the @xmath0-ray emitting gcs that we have reported here .",
    "for example , the brighter x - ray population of m80 is in many ways similar to 47  tucanae , the first @xmath0-ray gc known , while the fainter x - ray sources may differ  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of @xmath0-rays from m80 , if confirmed , would suggest that it also hosts a population of msps . under the assumption that the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity depends solely on the number of msps ( e.g. in the magnetospheric model ) , the predicted number of msps in the cluster using eq.(1 ) of @xcite",
    "is listed in table  [ gc_results ] .",
    "future multiwavelength observations of any msps should help in understanding the @xmath0-ray production mechanisms and the underlying msp populations .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra are in general consistent with single power law model , and shows no convincing evidence for cut - off at high energies .",
    "it is mainly due to limited photon statistics .",
    "however , the cases of the more significant cases of liller  1 and ngc  6624 , in which @xmath0-ray are found within the tidal radius , suggests that @xmath110gev emission exists at least for these two cases . if this is true , this high energy emission conform with the ic model , rather than the magnetospheric model .",
    "the @xmath110gev emission may correspond to the ic peak as predicted in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0-ray emission is associated with the gcs , one striking feature is the displacement of the @xmath0-ray emission from the gc cores .",
    "we briefly discuss this feature in the context of two radiation scenarios commonly discussed in the literature .    in the pulsar magnetosphere model ,",
    "one expects the emission to coincide spatially with the msp population . while msps should concentrate in the gc core in general , the finite number of msps in a gc ( i.e. , @xmath210 , see table  [ gc_results ] , except for liller  1 ) may invoke some offset of the msps  and thus the @xmath0-rays they emit  from the core . furthermore , in addition to the msp population formed in the core , some msps are formed near the tidal radius of the gcs .",
    "the superposition of @xmath0-rays from these two populations may not coincide with the gc core , but is at a certain distance from the core within the tidal radius .",
    "however , this scenario can not accommodate the case of the @xmath0-ray source next to ngc  6441 .    in the inverse compton models ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray emitting region depends not only on the distribution of the underlying msps , but also on the cooling timescale and the diffusion timescale of the accelerated particles .",
    "when the diffusion timescale is much smaller than the cooling timescale , the @xmath110rays may come from the outskirts of the gcs .    in the cases of liller 1 and ngc 6624 , the gamma - ray spectrum ( cf .",
    "[ liller1_spec ] and fig .",
    "[ ngc6624_spec ] ) can extend up to energies @xmath140  gev , which can not be explained in terms of curvature radiation inside the light cylinder .",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested that inverse compton scattering between background relativistic electrons / positrons in pulsar wind and the soft photons from the galactic disk can produce the observed gamma - rays from globular clusters .",
    "they predict that if the inverse compton upscattered galactic infrared photons are responsible for gev photons , then the compton upscattered galactic optical photons can produce gamma - rays up to 100  gev .",
    "they also predict that the gamma - rays are diffuse and are emitted from region much beyond the core of the globular cluster .",
    "if this is true the center of gamma - ray emission regions is affected by three factors : the proper motion of the globular cluster , the asymmetric diffusion coefficient and nearby optical / ir external sources like stars and nearby regions containing an enhanced amount of dust .    the discovery of several more @xmath0-ray emitting gcs reported in this work has allowed population studies to be carried out in order to better understand the relationship between the @xmath0-ray properties of gcs and other parameters of gcs .",
    "@xcite found that the stellar encounter rate scales with the @xmath0-ray luminosity , based on a sample of 8 @xmath0-ray emitting gcs .",
    "while the @xmath0-ray luminosity should correlate with the number of msps in the clusters in both models , it is expected that the low - energy photon energy density is also a good estimator of @xmath0-rays in the ic models .",
    "recently , using a total of 15 gcs that are @xmath0-ray sources or source candidates , including those reported in this work and those previously known  @xcite , @xcite have shown that correlations also exist between @xmath0-ray luminosity and metallicity , as well as @xmath0-ray luminosity and optical / infrared photon energy density .    to conclude , we report the detection of new @xmath0-ray emitting gcs , based on a ranking list that replies on the encounter rate of the gcs .",
    "the @xmath0-ray luminosity of liller  1 is the highest of all known @xmath0-ray gcs .",
    "its non - detection before this work may be due to its position that lies on the galactic plane , where galactic diffuse emission is very strong .",
    "liller  1 has very high encounter rate and metallicity , and may indeed host a large population of msps that have not been uncovered .",
    "some @xmath0-ray emitting gcs presented here are at distances of @xmath210  kpc away from us , whereas @xcite present the upper limits of known gcs out to a distance of 6  kpc only .",
    "therefore , we have demonstrated that the study here has gone a further step towards finding new sources even at larger distances .",
    "this then helps to expand the sample of known @xmath0-ray gcs for further studies .",
    "we acknowledge the use of data and software facilities from the fssc , managed by the heasarc at the goddard space flight center .",
