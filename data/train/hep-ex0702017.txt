    "the recent discovery of neutrino mixing  @xcite implies that lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) occurs .",
    "lfv in charged decays have not yet been observed , although they have long been identified as an unambiguous signature of new physics .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) extended to include finite mass differences from neutrino mixing imply @xmath3 mixing is generated at the one - loop level and thus suppressed by a factor of @xmath4 , which is many orders of magnitude below the experimental sensitivity .",
    "however , many new theories , for example sm with additional heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos or with left - handed and right - handed neutral isosinglets  @xcite ; msugra models with right handed neutrinos introduced via the seesaw mechanism  @xcite ; supersymmetric models with higgs exchange  @xcite or so(10 ) symmetry  @xcite ; or technicolor models with non - universal z@xmath5 exchange  @xcite , allow for @xmath6decays , where @xmath7 , at the level of @xmath8 .",
    "large neutrino mixing  @xcite could potentially induce large mixing between the supersymmetric partners of the leptons .",
    "while some scenario s predict higher rates for @xmath9decays , others , for example with inverted hierarchy rather than normal hierarchy of masses of supersymmetric partners of leptons , predict  @xcite higher rates for @xmath10decays .",
    "semi - leptonic neutrinoless decays involving pseudoscalar mesons like , where @xmath11 , are likely candidates for lfv in supersymmetric models  @xcite , for example , arising out of exchange of cp - odd pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson , which are further enhanced by color factors associated with these decays .",
    "the large coupling of higgs at @xmath12 vertex enhances final state containing the @xmath13 meson , giving a prediction of @xmath14  @xcite . some models with heavy dirac neutrinos  @xcite , two higgs doublet models , r - parity violating supersymmetric models , and flavor changing @xmath15 models with non - universal couplings  @xcite allow for observable parameter space of new physics  @xcite , while respecting the existing experimental bounds at the level of @xmath16 .",
    "present generation @xmath17 b - factories operating around the @xmath18(4s ) resonance also serve as @xmath0-factories , because the production cross - sections of @xmath19 are comparable to each other at center - of - mass ( cm ) energy near 10.58 @xmath20 .",
    "recent results from the searches of @xmath6/are presented here , along with a first attempt at combining the upper limits from the  and the belle experiments .",
    "in annihilations , @xmath6/decays have 2 characteristic features : the energy of tau - daughters is close to the half the cm energy , and the total invariant mass of the daughters is close to the mass of -lepton .",
    "sometimes , the mass of the daughters are calculated with total energy constrained to be half the cm energy , in order to improve upon the resolution of the mass variable .",
    "the general strategy for searches of such decays is to define a signal region in the energy - mass plane of the -daughters ( typically @xmath21 region ) , and optimize upon a set of selection criteria to reduce the contribution to background events from well - known sm processes .",
    "the principal sources of background are radiative di - muon or bhabha events , along with some irreducible contribution from -pair events having hard isr with @xmath22 or @xmath23 decays for @xmath6  or  searches , respectively .",
    "after applying the selection criteria , the signal efficiency ( ) and expected background events ( @xmath24 ) are estimated inside the signal region . finally , the number of observed events ( @xmath25 ) are counted ( or fitted ) from the data .",
    "as yet , no signal has been observed in any of the searches .",
    "so , an upper limit at 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) is obtained as : @xmath26 , where @xmath27is the 90% confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "upper limit on the number of signal events inside the signal box , and @xmath28 is the number of -decays studied from a sample of data with a luminosity of @xmath29 .    for the searches ,",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons are reconstructed in the following decay modes : for , and ( ) for , ( ) and for . in these searches , the signal efficiency ( ) in the above formula for @xmath30",
    "is the product of the branching fraction ( @xmath31 ) and reconstruction efficiency ( @xmath32 ) of the @xmath33 decay mode under consideration . to obtain a combined upper limit with @xmath13 and @xmath34",
    "decays , the observed and expected background events and the signal efficiencies are added using @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the respective branching fractions and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the corresponding reconstruction efficiencies",
    ".    searches for lfv in @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays have been performed with @xmath29 = 232.2and 339by the  experiment  @xcite , and with @xmath29 = 535and 401by the belle experiment  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results for these searches are summarized in table 1 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 have been used  @xcite for combining modes .",
    "the results from the  and the belle experiments are combined by adding the number of observed and expected background events along with their symmetrized errors , respectively , inside the signal region .",
    "the signal efficiencies are averaged using weights than account for the integrated luminosity for the corresponding searches .",
    "this is the most conservative approach given that the signal and background pdfs are different for similar searches by different experiments , because of differing resolutions on reconstructed mass and energy among the experiments .",
    "thus , in this procedure , the distribution of both the signal and the background events inside the signal region are taken to be uniform , and only the rates of signal and backgrounds events contribute to the combination .",
    "combined frequentist limits are calculated including all uncertainties using the technique of cousins and highland  @xcite following the implementation of barlow  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "10@xmath47 mc samples are generated according to a poisson distribution with mean @xmath48 , where the background @xmath49 and signal @xmath50 are each drawn randomly from gaussian distributions describing their respective pdfs .",
    "for the signal gaussian , the mean and the standard deviation are @xmath51 and its uncertainty , with the latter determined by propagation of errors .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath52 is varied until we find a value for which 10% of the samples yield a number of events less than that observed in the combined data . at 90% c.l .",
    "this procedure gives the combined upper limit observed for each decay mode .",

    "@xmath101 are summarized in table 1 . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the observed limit is significantly lower than the expected limit , because both experiments observe less events than expected  @xcite .",
