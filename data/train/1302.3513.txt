    "optimal control theory is concerned with the analysis of controlled dynamical systems , where one aims at steering such a system from a given configuration to some desired target one by minimizing or maximizing some criterion . the pontryagin maximum principle ( denoted in short pmp ) , established at the end of the fifties for finite dimensional general nonlinear continuous - time dynamics",
    "( see @xcite , and see @xcite for the history of this discovery ) , is the milestone of the classical optimal control theory .",
    "it provides a first - order necessary condition for optimality , by asserting that any optimal trajectory must be the projection of an extremal .",
    "the pmp then reduces the search of optimal trajectories to a boundary value problem posed on extremals . optimal control theory , and in particular the pmp , have an immense field of applications in various domains , and it is not our aim here to list them .",
    "we refer the reader to textbooks on optimal control such as @xcite for many examples of theoretical or practical applications of optimal control , essentially in a continuous - time setting .    right after this discovery",
    "the corresponding theory has been developed for discrete - time dynamics , under appropriate convexity assumptions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , leading to a version of the pmp for discrete - time optimal control problems .",
    "the considerable development of the discrete - time control theory was motivated by many potential applications e.g.  to digital systems or in view of discrete approximations in numerical simulations of differential controlled systems .",
    "we refer the reader to the textbooks @xcite for details on this theory and many examples of applications .",
    "it can be noted that some early works devoted to the discrete - time pmp ( like @xcite ) are mathematically incorrect .",
    "many counter - examples were provided in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , showing that , as is now well known , the exact analogous of the continuous - time pmp does not hold at the discrete level .",
    "more precisely , the maximization condition of the pmp can not be expected to hold in general in the discrete - time case .",
    "nevertheless a weaker condition can be derived , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  42.1 p.  330 ) .",
    "note as well that approximate maximization conditions are given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  6.4 ) and that a wide literature is devoted to the introduction of convexity assumptions on the dynamics allowing one to recover the maximization condition in the discrete case ( such as the concept of _ directional convexity _ assumption used in @xcite for example ) .",
    "the _ time scale _ theory was introduced in @xcite in order to unify discrete and continuous analysis .",
    "a time scale @xmath2 is an arbitrary non empty closed subset of @xmath1 , and a dynamical system is said to be posed on the time scale @xmath2 whenever the time variable evolves along this set @xmath2 .",
    "the continuous - time case corresponds to @xmath3 and the discrete - time case corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "the time scale theory aims at closing the gap between continuous and discrete cases and allows one to treat more general models of processes involving both continuous and discrete time elements , and more generally for dynamical systems where the time evolves along a set of a complex nature which may even be a cantor set ( see e.g.  @xcite for a study of a seasonally breeding population whose generations do not overlap , or @xcite for applications to economics ) .",
    "many notions of standard calculus have been extended to the time scale framework , and we refer the reader to @xcite for details on this theory .    the theory of the calculus of variations on time scales , initiated in @xcite , has been well studied in the existing literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "few attempts have been made to derive a pmp on time scales . in @xcite",
    "the authors establish a _ weak _ pmp for shifted controlled systems , where the controls are not subject to any pointwise constraint and under certain restrictive assumptions .",
    "a strong version of the pmp is claimed in @xcite but many arguments thereof are erroneous ( see remark [ remzhan ] for details ) .",
    "the objective of the present article is to state and prove a strong version of the pmp on time scales , valuable for general nonlinear dynamics , and without assuming any unnecessary lipschitz or convexity conditions .",
    "our statement is as general as possible , and encompasses the classical continuous - time pmp that can be found e.g.  in @xcite as well as all versions of discrete - time pmp s mentioned above . in accordance with",
    "all known results , the maximization condition is obtained at right - dense points of the time scale and a weaker one ( similar to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 42.1 p.  330 ) ) is derived at right - scattered points .",
    "moreover , we consider general constraints on the initial and final values of the state variable and we derive the resulting transversality conditions .",
    "we provide as well a version of the pmp for optimal control problems with parameters .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section  [ part1 ] ,",
    "we first provide some basic issues of time scale calculus ( subsection  [ section1 ] ) .",
    "we define some appropriate notions such as the notion of stable @xmath0-dense direction in subsection [ sec_topoprelim ] . in subsection [ section2 ]",
    "we settle the notion of admissible control and define general optimal control problems on time scales .",
    "our main result ( pontryagin maximum principle , theorem [ thmmain ] ) is stated in subsection [ section2bis1 ] , and we analyze and comment the results in a series of remarks . section [ part3 ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ thmmain ] .",
    "first , in subsection [ section10 ] we make some preliminary comments explaining which obstructions may appear when dealing with general time scales , and why we were led to a proof based on ekeland s variational principle",
    ". we also comment on the article @xcite in remark [ remzhan ] . in subsection",
    "[ section3 ] , after having shown that the set of admissible controls is open , we define needle - like variations at right - dense and right - scattered points and derive some properties . in subsection [ section4 ] , we apply ekeland s variational principle to a well chosen functional in an appropriate complete metric space and then prove the pmp .",

    ". we could cite many other variants , all of them relying , at some step , on a fixed point argument .",

    "the adjoint vector is then constructed by propagating backward in time a lagrange multiplier which is normal to this cone .",
    "roughly , needle - like variations are kinds of perturbations of the reference control in @xmath416 topology ( perturbations with arbitrary values , over small intervals of time ) which generate perturbations of the trajectories in @xmath417 topology .    due to obvious topological obstructions ,",

    "of course to overcome this difficulty one can assume that the @xmath51-measure of right - dense points not admitting a right interval included in @xmath2 is zero .",
    "this assumption is however not very natural and would rule out time scales such as a generalized cantor set having a positive @xmath56-measure .",
    "another serious difficulty that we are faced with on a general time scale is the technical fact that the formula , accounting for lebesgue points , is valid only for @xmath421 such that @xmath422 . actually if @xmath423 then is not true any more in general ( it is very easy to construct a time scale @xmath2 for which fails whenever @xmath423 , even with @xmath424 ) .",

    "it requires however the treatment of other kinds of technicalities , one of them being the concept of stable @xmath0-dense direction that we were led to introduce .",

    "as is usual in the proof of the pmp by ekeland s principle , the authors deduce from considerations on sequences of perturbation controls @xmath425 the existence of lagrange multipliers @xmath426 and @xmath427 ; the problem is that these multipliers are built separately for right - scattered and dense points ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the first equality in ( 35 ) can obviously fail : the term @xmath428 is a convex combination of @xmath429 and @xmath430 since @xmath431 is assumed to be convex , but the parameter of this convex combination is not necessarily equal to @xmath432 as claimed by the authors ( unless @xmath337 is affine in @xmath234 and @xmath338 is convex in @xmath234 , but this restrictive assumption is not made ) .",

    "indeed , even though @xmath437 ( ekeland s distance ) tends to @xmath30 , there is no guarantee that @xmath429 tends to @xmath438 .",
