    "however dwarf galaxies do not contain the usual triggering mechanisms believed to operate in large spirals , such as spiral arms or bars .",
    "many young starbursts in dwarfs ( especially the galaxies characterized by wolf - rayet emission ) seem to have been triggered by tidal / interaction events @xcite .",
    "possible perpetrators of these interaction episodes are massive spirals , dwarfs or even intergalactic gas clouds . the impact of these interactions on the gas can have important consequences on the nature and mode of star formation .",
    "ngc 3077 is a nearby example of a galaxy that has experienced a strong tidal interaction in the recent past and is now in a starburst phase .",
    "ngc 3077 is the somewhat overlooked third member of the widely - studied and closest group of strongly interacting galaxies , the m 81 system ( d= 3.9 mpc ; table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the morphological classification of ngc 3077 is ambiguous , perhaps due to its recent interaction with the of the members of the group , m 81 and m 82 .",
    "signs of interactions between the galaxies are well established .",

    "while m 82 , the other dwarf interacting with m81 , has gotten most of the attention , ngc 3077 is also undergoing a burst of recent star formation @xcite .",
    "the total atomic mass content near ngc 3077 ( @xmath5 ) is similar to that found in m 82 @xcite . unlike m 82",
    "though , the majority of the atomic gas is outside the optical confines of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the total molecular gas content differs by nearly two orders of magnitude ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cause of these differences are not well understood .",
    "in fact , numerical models have yet to reach consensus whether the gas stripped out of a previously gas - rich ngc 3077 or stolen from m 81 during the interaction @xcite    lower resolution co studies of ngc 3077 show that it contains a large molecular cloud complex ( @xmath6 ) at its center @xcite .",
    "it is probably this molecular cloud complex that provides the fuel for the current starburst event .",
    "the goal of this paper is to map out the molecular complex at high resolution in co(1 - 0 ) to look for further clues on how the starburst in ngc 3077 has proceeded , and to access the validity of the galactic conversion factor in this metal rich dwarf",
    ". also simultaneous observations of co(2 - 1 ) are used to determine molecular gas temperatures and densities .",
    "simultaneous aperture synthesis observations of the co(1 - 0 ) transition ( 115.271 ghz ) and the co(2 - 1 ) transition ( 230.538 ghz ) were made with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter interferometer between 1997 october 12 and 1997 december 09 ( table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the interferometer consists of six 10.4 m antennas with cryogenically cooled sis receivers @xcite .",
    "system temperatures ( single sideband ) ranged from 400 - 1800 k at 115 ghz and 500 - 1100 k at 230 ghz . a 64 channel , 2 mhz filterbank was used to cover each transition .",

    "the two pointings were mosaicked using the miriad software package .",
    "the maps are naturally weighted and primary - beam corrected .",
    "the ovro primary beam is @xmath164@xmath12 at ( 1 - 0 ) and @xmath134@xmath12 at ( 2 - 1 ) .",

    "the noise increases towards the edge of the field both because of the decreased sensitivity due to the primary beam and due to a factor of @xmath12 less integration time . reported noise levels for this paper are those measured from line free regions of the map half - way between the map center and the fwhm points .",
    "the noise level is a bit lower than this in the center ( @xmath1 10% ) and somewhat higher than this towards the edges of the map ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "all further data reduction , analysis and manipulation was done using the nrao aips package .",
    "the shortest baselines sampled in the dataset are @xmath1415 m. this corresponds to spatial scales of @xmath136@xmath12 for ( 1 - 0 ) and @xmath118@xmath12 for ( 2 - 1 ) .",

    "the strongest star forming region , as traced by 2.6 mm continuum (  3.2 ) and p@xmath17 ( figure 4b ) , is located at the interface of these two gmcs and is labeled `` * '' in figure 3 .",
    "weaker star formation is seen towards the northeastern complex , gmc a.    the correspondence between the central molecular gas distribution and the extinction seen in the hst foc uv image ( figure 4c ) is striking .",
    "this strongly suggests that the youngest star forming regions are obscured by the dust associated with the molecular clouds .",
    "the two clusters seen in the uv ( uv1 and uv2 ) are presumably older than the starburst cluster , having cleared out much of their molecular gas .",

    "very recently , high resolution hi observations of ngc 3077 have been presented and show that hi and the superbubbles tend to be anti - correlated @xcite .      because of",
    "its higher sensitivity and slightly higher effective critical density , the co(2 - 1 ) data are used to fit the properties of the gmcs .",
    "each cloud , identified as a region of spatially and spectrally localized emission but not necessarily a gravitationally bound entity , has been fit with an elliptical gaussian to determine its size , location , and intensity .",
    "three molecular clouds lie outside the ( 2 - 1 ) primary beam . of these ,",
    "only gmc f was fit using the co(1 - 0 ) data since gmc e & g are weak or at the edge of the ( 1 - 0 ) primary beam .",

    "on the other hand , the linewidths of the clouds in ngc 3077 are larger than seen in other dwarf galaxies .",

    "it is possible that these gmcs are made of smaller unresolved clumps . in ssuch a case",
    ", the linewidths of the individual clumps will be smaller , and our measured linewidths will reflect the random motions of the clumps in the gmc . using the derived rotation curve (  3.1.2 ) , we estimate that the contribution of galactic rotation to the linewidth is at most 5 km s@xmath7 . the two gmcs with the largest linewidths are gmc b & d. these gmcs are the ones most closely associated with the starburst .",
    "gmc f , well away from the starburst , does has a linewidth that is much smaller , and similar to what is found for the other dwarfs .",
    "masses estimated assuming that these gmcs are in virial equilibrium are compared with masses estimated by other means in  4.2 .",
    "the masses estimated assuming virialization holds tend to be larger than found by other methods .",
    "this fact implies that at the burst gmcs additional contributions to the linewidth besides gravitation may be present .",
    "figure 5 displays the velocity field ( moment 1 ) and the velocity dispersion ( moment 2 ) maps derived from the co(1 - 0 ) dataset ( the co(2 - 1 ) velocity field , not shown , is similar to co(1 - 0 ) ) .",
    "while only a limited portion of the total hi velocity field can be traced with co , it appears that galactic rotation is detected for the first time in the molecular gas .",
    "though small deviations are seen , the velocity field is consistent with solid body rotation with v@xmath21 5 km s@xmath7 and a total range of @xmath22 km s @xmath7 over the central 20@xmath12 radius along a p.a . of @xmath16 ,",
    "similar to the optical major axis ( figure 5 insert ) .",
    "galactic rotation is @xmath23 , or @xmath24 ( corrected for an inclination of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sense of rotation of the co velocity field is _ opposite _ of what is seen in hi @xcite . in co , the blueshifted side of the galaxy",
    "is in the northeast , whereas in hi the blueshifted side is the southwest ( though there some evidence for a reversal of the hi velocity field towards the very center of the galaxy  figure 12 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possible explanation for this reversal is that the four gmcs that dominate the central emission are rotationally decoupled from the rest of the galaxy .",
    "a second possibility is that the velocity field traced by the hi is not representative of the true rotation of ngc 3077 .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the velocity field seen in the atomic gas appears to smoothly trace that of the tidal bridge connecting ngc 3077 to m 81 , and hence the galactic rotation of ngc 3077 may not be separable from the bulk motions of the tidal tail .",
    "optical spectroscopy , like co , suggests that the blueshifted nebular velocities are in the northeast @xcite .",
    "we feel that the co velocity field probably reflects galactic rotation and large beam hi observations do not .",
    "the velocity of the third major co complex , ( gmcs f & g ) , located along the minor axis , has a line center velocity of -22 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this is substantially blueshifted ( @xmath26 km s@xmath7 ) relative to what would be expected from a rotating disk with the co velocity field .",
    "this suggests that the cloud complex is either falling in towards or expanding out from the nucleus .",
    "observations of continuum emission at 2.6 mm and 1.3 mm have been made for ngc 3077 .",
    "2.6 mm continuum is detected and figure 6 shows the 2.6 mm continuum map generated with a 75k@xmath27 tapered ( beamsize @xmath28 ; table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "1.3 mm continuum emission is not convincingly detected at any location , with a 3@xmath29 upper limit of 9.5 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the 2.6 mm continuum peaks between gmcs b & d , consistent within the uncertainties with the dominant nebula seen in p@xmath17 .",
    "a possible weaker source is seen towards the uv cluster , uv2 .",
    "the peak intensity of the starburst is 3.1@xmath300.7 mjy beam@xmath7 ( as measured in the @xmath31 untapered map ) .",
    "the emission is slightly resolved . the total 2.6 mm flux summed over the central",
    "10@xmath12 ( 190 pc ) centered on the starburst cluster marked by `` * '' in figure 3 is 8.0@xmath302.0 mjy .",
    "the morphology is consistent with the higher resolution and sensitivity 20 cm vla map of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the central cluster has a flux of 3.6@xmath300.3 mjy at 1.46 ghz over a deconvolved size of 11 pc x 6 pc .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath17 ( @xmath32 ) , found for the central cluster between 2.6 mm and 20 cm is @xmath33 .",
    "this flat spectral index demonstrates that the radio emission from the central starburst hii region is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung emission out to 1.4 ghz .",
    "single - dish observations of the central region of ngc 3077 ( @xmath34 beam at 5 cm and @xmath35 beam at 2.8 cm ) , obtain fluxes of 22@xmath308 mjy at 5 cm @xcite and 13@xmath301 mjy at 2.8 cm @xcite .",
    "these fluxes give spectral indices of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "evidently , the radio fluxes detected in these large beams are also predominately thermal emission and are dominated by the central 10@xmath12 of the galaxy . beyond 5 cm ,",
    "synchrotron emission becomes a significant contributor to the radio flux .",
    "changes in the physical conditions of the molecular gas can be traced using the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) ratio .",
    "when opacities are large , the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) ratio is just the ratio of the rayleigh - jeans corrections at the two frequencies , and hence is moderately temperature sensitive ( eg .",
    "the physical condition of the molecular gas in dwarfs galaxies is of interest because they may be responsible for some portion of the observed differences in @xmath38 , molecular gas abundances and star formation properties between dwarfs and spirals @xcite .",
    "gas properties in dwarf galaxies such as density , temperature and opacity appear not to differ significantly on large scales @xcite , but this is not well established yet .",
    "physical conditions of the gas in dwarf galaxies , including ngc 3077 , have been addressed elsewhere @xcite . in this section",
    "we focus on new insights gained from these higher resolution images .",
    "the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) ratio for both the peak antenna temperatures , t@xmath39 , and integrated intensities of each gmc are displayed in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "gmcs b & d both have ratios @xmath10.6 , while gmc a has a slightly higher ratio of @xmath10.82 .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than are common for starburst regions @xcite , but are consistent with those of galactic gmcs , and of nearby , less active dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the t@xmath39 ratios do not peak at the exact location of the starburst in ngc 3077 , unlike what is seen in the other nearby starbursts like m 82 @xcite , ic 342 @xcite and maffei 2 @xcite . ratios of 0.6 - 0.8 imply an excitation temperature , t@xmath40 of 5 - 10 k for the clouds . comparing t@xmath40 to t@xmath39 , for each cloud",
    "provides an estimate of the gmcs areal filling factor , @xmath41 .",
    "typical values of the filling factors are 0.5 for the hii region gmcs ( b & d ) and 0.2 for gmc a. unlike the t@xmath39 ratios , the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) integrated intensity ratios _ do _ peak towards gmc d near the starburst site .",
    "the difference between the integrated line ratio and the t@xmath39 ratio is explained by the co(2 - 1 ) spectral line being wider than the co(1 - 0 ) line in this region .",
    "the co(3 - 2 ) linewidth shows the same trend @xcite .",
    "since the amount of flux resolved out by the interferometer differs for the two transitions , the observed ratios will differ from the true ratios by factors up to the ratio of the differences in resolved out flux , 30% , depending on the distribution of the resolved flux .",
    "this effect should be less dramatic for ratios of t@xmath39 since the brightest regions of emission are generally localized in clouds .",
    "therefore , the ratio of t@xmath39 are likely better representations of the true ratio than ratios of integrated intensities , but are still lower limits . since the amount of resolved out flux is greater at co(2 - 1 ) than at co(1 - 0 ) , the diffuse component resolved out by the interferometer appears to have a ratio larger than 1 , suggestive of optically thin gas .",
    "the single - dish co(3 - 2)/co(1 - 0 ) line ratio of 1.1 for ngc 3077 is one of the largest measured for dwarf starbursts @xcite , so it is not unreasonable to expect some optically thin co emission .    a sample of large velocity gradient ( lvg ) radiative transfer models were run to relate the observed t@xmath39 and ratios to the intrinsic cloud properties of density , @xmath42 , and kinetic temperature , t@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "details of the lvg model used can be found in @xcite . in figure 7 , two models are displayed with @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the three central gmcs .",
    "these abundance per velocity gradients are based on the solar neighborhood co / h@xmath46 abundance ( @xmath47 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a velocity gradient , @xmath48 ( table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "best fit solutions obtained from the lvg modeling give @xmath49 and t@xmath50 k for the three central gmcs .",
    "cooler and denser solutions are also permitted for gmcs a and b ( @xmath51 and t@xmath52 k ) .",
    "little difference is found between the two solutions with different @xmath53 .",
    "changing the estimated filling factors substantially from the assumed values worsen the @xmath54 fits . increasing",
    "the filling factor by a factor of two pushes the best fit solutions to slightly cooler ( @xmath55 t@xmath56 k ) and denser ( @xmath57 dex ) solutions . since the ratios are lower limits due to the differences in resolved out flux between the two transitions , the true gas densities and temperatures are likely to be higher than the above values .",
    "single - dish lvg modeling using co(3 - 2 ) data do , in fact , obtain higher gas temperatures and densities ( t@xmath58 k , @xmath51 ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , while not dramatic , indications of elevated kinetic temperatures are present .      to study the relationship between molecular gas , dynamics , and star formation one must have an accurate accounting of the amount of molecular gas .",
    "usually n@xmath59 is estimated from i@xmath60 using a conversion factor , @xmath38 , which is empirically determined from galactic molecular clouds .",
    "there is evidence that @xmath38 can vary . in nuclear starburst regions , the intense radiation field and the different cloud conditions due to the deep potential",
    "well can have significant effects on @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "while dynamical influences on the conversion factor are expected to be less important in dwarf galaxies , their low metallicities cause co to be difficult to detect @xcite . the fact that ngc 3077 is a low mass dwarf with solar metallicity @xcite and strong star formation makes it an interesting object in which to estimate the conversion factor .",
    "molecular masses estimated using the galactic disk conversion factor , @xmath61 = @xmath62 @xcite , are : @xmath63 ( eg .",
    "* ) , where @xmath64 is the co(1 - 0 ) flux in jy km s@xmath7 .",
    "derived masses for the gmcs using @xmath38 are shown in table [ tab4 ] .    to access the applicability of the galactic conversion factor to ngc 3077",
    ", we attempt to estimate the amount of molecular gas independently of @xmath38 .",
    "several methods exist to estimate molecular gas masses , independent of co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "since the gmcs in the center of ngc 3077 are resolved , the total mass of the gmcs can be estimated from the virial theorem made with the assumption that they are virialized ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the virial cloud masses assuming @xmath65 with @xmath66 , appropriate for galactic clouds ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are displayed in table [ tab4 ] . in general , masses obtained from the virial theorem are larger than those obtained from the co(1 - 0 ) conversion factor .",
    "this is particularly evident for gmcs b & d , where the mass derived from the virial theorem is an order of magnitude larger than that from the co conversion factor .",
    "this stems directly from the fact that the clouds have large and possibly nonequilibrium linewidths at these locations (  3.1.2 ) .",
    "the virial mass of the most distant gmc , f , is in better agreement with the conversion factor estimate there .",
    "optical extinction can also be used to estimate the total gas mass present towards the starburst .",
    "the extinction to the central starburst is derived by comparing the h@xmath17 flux of the starburst to the extinction - free millimeter continuum (  4.3 ) , and is found to be a@xmath67 . if it is assumed that the starburst is in the middle of the cloud , then a total extinction of 5 mag is estimated .",
    "assuming that n@xmath68 ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a total column density of n@xmath69 is implied .",
    "whereas , the average co(1 - 0 ) intensity at the same location is @xmath70 . from these results a conversion factor of @xmath71 is estimated .",
    "this is slightly smaller but within a factor of two of the galactic value .",
    "gas masses can also be estimated from thermal dust emission . for a dust temperature of 34 k @xcite , a 1.3 mm dust absorption coefficent of @xmath72 @xcite and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , @xmath73 .",
    "if we assume that all 1.3 mm flux is due to dust emission ( an upper limit since some thermal bremsstrahlung will still contribute ) , the 3@xmath29 upper limit of 10 mjy beam@xmath7 equates to @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , unless the nature and emissivity of the dust in ngc 3077 is substantially different from what is found for the galaxy , the gas masses implied by the dust emission are also significantly lower than the virial values and more in line with the extinction values .",
    "so we find that , in general , the dust emission also favors the lower values of the conversion factor .    in this context ,",
    "the two gmcs ( b & d ) with the largest `` virial '' masses appear not to be in virial equilibrium .",
    "these two clouds are the closest to the dynamical center and the starburst , and have unusually large linewidths for their sizes (  3.1.1 ) .",
    "additional evidence that these clouds are not virialized can be seen by comparing the densities implied by the virial mass with those estimated from gas excitation ( lvg modeling ; figure 7 ) .",
    "the dot - dashed line represents the beam - averaged molecular cloud density implied by the virial theorem . in the case of gmc d ,",
    "the beam - averaged value is a factor of two larger than any acceptable parameter space allowed from the lvg analysis and a factor of six larger than the optimal solution .",
    "for gmcs a & b , there is strictly speaking some overlap with regions of acceptable parameter space but they are again much denser than the optimal lvg solution (  4.1 ) .",
    "if these gmcs resolve into smaller clumps then these clumps appear to move around at velocities greater than virialization suggests .",
    "detailed studies of the nearby starburst spirals , ic 342 and maffei 2 , also show that the gmcs also have super - virial linewidths ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "significant non - circular motions due to barred potentials are likely the cause of the large linewidths in these two spiral galaxies , but such motions can not be the cause in ngc 3077 .",
    "the increased linewidths indicate that these gmcs associated with the starburst have a higher level of turbulence , possibly from shocks due to star formation , cloud - cloud collisions , or the mechanical energy input from the associated superbubbles @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the above methods imply that the co conversion factor applicable to ngc 3077 is approximately equal to or slightly lower than the galactic value of @xmath75 .",
    "since ngc 3077 is roughly solar metallicity , this is reasonable .      at millimeter wavelengths synchrotron emission is weak and the radio continuum emission for normal galaxies is dominated by optically thin free - free emission or dust emission .",
    "dust emission is weak at 1.3 mm (  3.2 ) , and hence should not be a significant contaminant to the 2.6 mm continuum emission . therefore 2.6 mm provides an excellent estimate of the lyman continuum flux and the strength of massive star formation .",
    "we use our 2.6 mm continuum detection to make an extinction - free estimate of the strength of the starburst in ngc 3077 .",
    "the number of lyman continuum photons implied by the 8.0 mjy of 2.6 mm continuum is n@xmath76 over the central 10@xmath12 .",
    "we detect n@xmath77 from the central starburst cluster alone ( assuming t@xmath78 k , eg . * ? ? ?",

    "galaxies only ngc 1569 ( whose molecular mass is probably underestimated due to its low metallicity ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ngc 3310 have higher values . given the amount of molecular gas and the derived star formation rate , the central molecular cloud complex can support star formation for only @xmath1 11 myr .",
    "the several superbubbles in h@xmath17 are further evidence for a shortlived starburst @xcite .",
    "the mechanical power of a wind driven superbubble gives an age of @xmath9010 myr for the superbubbles , @xcite , and presumably the starburst , in ngc 3077 .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible that the current starburst epoch started around 10 myrs ago .",
    "the uv clusters near gmc a have weak or no 2.6 mm continuum associated with them and only weak p@xmath17 emission .",
    "these clusters that are not embedded in molecular gas are probably somewhat older than those seen at the interface of gmcs b & d. optical / uv observation of these clusters suggest that they are @xmath1 10 - 100 myr old with the older age stars increasingly dominating as one proceeds away from the center @xcite .",
    "in the course of an interaction redistribution of large amounts of gas can occur , often times leading to starbursts in the host galaxies .",
    "ngc 3077 is a dramatic example of such tidal carnage , however it is as yet unclear what the source of the gas that has generated these tidal features are and how they relate to the current nuclear starburst .",
    "the gas surrounding ngc 3077 either originally belonged to gas - rich disk associated with ngc 3077 that has been stripped out due to the interaction @xcite , or the gas has been captured from m 81 during its most recent passage @xcite . in either case , the interaction has had a strong influence on the gas distribution , and probably is responsible at some level for the starburst .",
    "a consideration of the timescales involved provide clues as to how the starburst and the interaction are related in detail . despite the ambiguity in the source of the neutral gas surrounding ngc 3077 ,",
    "all simulations of the m 81-m 82-ngc 3077 group agree that the strongest interaction between ngc 3077 and m 81 occurred 300 - 600 myr ago @xcite .",
    "the strength of the starburst estimated from the 2.6 mm continuum , the superbubble sizes @xcite and the uv colors @xcite all suggest that the current burst of star formation is @xmath9010 myr old .",
    "while the star formation of the outer parts of ngc 3077 and its halo object , `` garland '' , appear to be @xmath90150 myrs old , more consistent with a direct trigger by the interaction @xcite , the central burst appears too young to have been triggered directly .    based on considerations of dynamical friction alone",
    ", it is expected that gas should rain down on the disk of ngc 3077 for a few gyrs after closest interaction .",
    "additional evidence for infall can be seen in our co data : firstly , the starburst appears to be a result of the collision of gmcs b & d , and secondly , the complex of molecular gas comprising gmcs e - g is located along the minor axis of ngc 3077 and is moving with substantial net line - of - sight motion relative to the lsr velocity of the galaxy .    to get an estimate of the relevant dynamical friction timescale for the gas around ngc 3077",
    ", we consider the fate of the recently discovered atomic / molecular gas cloud complex @xmath14.8 kpc to the southeast of ngc 3077 s center @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that this complex may be a dwarf galaxy forming . whether this gas cloud ( the wh complex ) will form a separate dwarf galaxy or",
    "will fall back into ngc 3077 depends on the geometry of the system .",
    "despite many attempts , the exact interaction geometry of the m 81-m 82-ngc 3077 system is still not completely understood @xcite , but the models suggest 30@xmath91 - 50@xmath91 inclinations with respect to the plane of the sky . adopting an inclination of 45@xmath91 and a total mass of ngc 3077 inside the radius of the wh complex of @xmath92 @xcite , we estimate an escape velocity of 120 km s@xmath7 at the location of wh complex .",
    "the observed velocity of the wh complex is @xmath115 km s@xmath7 , or only @xmath110 km s@xmath7 different from the v@xmath15 of ngc 3077 , significantly less than the escape velocity .",
    "this implies that the wh complex must be moving within @xmath93 of the plane of the sky , if it is to escape ngc 3077 s gravitational potential and became a separate dwarf galaxy .",
    "if the complex is bound to ngc 3077 it will spiral into the nucleus due to dynamical friction .",
    "the timescale for a cloud complex to spiral into the center is ( eg . , pg .",
    "428 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the distance between the cloud and the center of the galaxy , @xmath96 is the orbital speed of the cloud , @xmath97 is the mass of the cloud and @xmath98 is the coulomb logarithm ( the natural logarthim of the ratio of maximum to minimum impact parameters ) .",
    "there is some uncertainty in this value since the wh complex is not likely on a circular orbit .",
    "( strickly speaking , the lower limit in the eq.(2 ) is due to the fact that this equation applies to stellar systems ; since gas is dissipational it can lose angular momentum more quickly .",
    "however , internal dissipation in the cloud should not significantly influence the derived timescale since the basic assumption of a test mass used in this calculation should hold over most of the orbit .",
    "the dissipational nature of the gas should only become important when the cloud reaches a distance from the nucleus where tidal forces being to disrupt the cloud [ @xmath99 for the wh complex ] ) .",
    "we adopt the following values as suitable to the wh complex , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , v@xmath102 @xcite and @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is approximated as @xmath95 divided by the diameter of the cloud ; also consistent with the formulation of @xcite ) . for these values ,",
    "the implied dynamical fiction timescale is @xmath1600 myrs .",
    "this value is about the same as the time since closest approach .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable that large clouds of atomic or molecular gas similar in mass to the wh complex have spiraled into the center of ngc 3077 with time delays consistent with the current burst .",
    "it is also possible that if ngc 3077 had a large disk of gas previous to the interaction , it could have been driven into the nucleus to trigger the burst .",
    "models suggest that strong tidal interactions can set up bar modes that drive gas to the galaxy center ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this scenario is less favorable for two reasons : ( 1 ) the timescales for gas inflow are extremely fast ( a few dynamical times or less , @xmath105 myr ; * ? ? ? * ) , and again would seem to trigger a burst too quickly , ( 2 ) there is no indication of a stellar bar , or any strongly disturbed stellar component remaining in ngc 3077 .",
    "therefore , we favor recent infall of gas onto the disk of the ngc 3077 as the cause of the current burst . if ngc 3077 did have a large disk of gas as suggest by yun et al @xcite , the above points suggest that a burst of star formation starting a few hundred myrs ago could have been driven .",
    "there are indications for this somewhat older stellar population @xcite .",
    "this might provide hints that the gas around ngc 3077 has been stripped from ngc 3077 itself , however this can not be taken as proof . while important , how the gas arrived outside the optical disk in the first place does not effect the conclusion that the gas is dynamically unstable and is prone to infall on timescales of hundreds of myrs .",
    "it seems quite reasonable that gas clouds raing down onto the disk of ngc 3077 will drive starburst eposides for the next few @xmath1 gyrs .",
    "there are other examples of infall triggered starbursts , such as the galactic disk ( the high velocity clouds , eg .",
    "* ) , and possibly nearby dwarf starbursts such as ngc 5253 @xcite .",
    "like ngc 3077 , ngc 5253 is much too far from its putative partner ( m 83 ) to have interacted in the last few myrs ( the age of its starburst ) . if these starbursts are triggered by the gas accreting back onto the disk from a past interaction , then significant delays can easily be explained .",
    "if such a scenario is correct then a dwarf galaxy may not always need a close companion in order for its star formation to be triggered by an interaction event .",
    "smaller clouds of gas ( @xmath106 ) falling back to the galaxy can sustain bursts of star formation for several gyrs after closest approach .",
    "images of ngc 3077 in the lines of co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) , obtained from the owens valley millimeter array , show co emission in three major complexes .",
    "two of the complexes are associated with the central starburst and the third is along the minor axis at a distance of @xmath10.5 kpc .",
    "the three complexes resolve into at least seven gmcs , with diameters of @xmath1 70 pc and masses of @xmath2 , similar to large gmcs in the galaxy and in other nearby gas - rich dwarfs .",
    "linewidths of the two gmcs closest to the starburst are quite large , suggesting that either winds , outflows or accretion flows are important in these clouds .",
    "galactic rotation is detected for the first time in the molecular gas .",
    "the molecular gas is counterrotating with respect to the large scale hi tidal bridge .",
    "molecular gas makes up @xmath150 % of the dynamical mass in the central 10@xmath12 .    the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) antenna temperature ratio in ngc 3077 ranges from 0.6 - 0.82 , corresponding to t@xmath107 5 - 10 k , typical of galactic gmcs .",
    "densities and kinetic temperatures obtained from lvg modeling indicate that the central gmcs have @xmath108 and t@xmath50 k.    three methods are compared to estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen and hence assess the validity of the galactic conversion factor is ngc 3077 . the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission upper limits and the optical dust extinction methods both yield masses consistent with estimates based on the galactic conversion factor .",
    "virial masses are slightly higher but consistent with the co masses , except for the two gmcs closest to the starburst , which are probably not in virial equilibrium .",
    "the galactic conversion factor appears applicable to ngc 3077 , consistent with its solar metallicity .",
    "2.6 mm continuum emission is also detected coincident with the main p@xmath17 nebula , between the two largest gmcs .",
    "the spectrum is flat from 2.6 mm to 5 cm establishing that the bulk of the radio continuum emission is thermal free - free emission .",
    "the strength of the continuum implies that the central starburst region has @xmath109 or @xmath13000 o7 stars , 5 - 10 times that predicted from h@xmath17 emission .",
    "based on the continuum data an extinction - free star formation rate of 0.4 @xmath4 is derived for the central 190 pc of ngc 3077 . at this rate",
    "the amount of molecular gas present can sustain star formation for only @xmath110 myrs .",
    "this age is consistent with the age of the superbubbles .",
    "we suggest that the burst is much younger than the age of the m 81-ngc 3077 interaction .",
    "( 1 ) the youth of the burst , ( 2 ) the location of the burst at the interface between two gmcs , ( 3 ) the presence of molecular clouds distributed along the minor axis , and ( 4 ) the large amounts of atomic and molecular gas just outside the optical galaxy all lead to the conclusion that the current burst resulted from neutral gas that was torn out of the galaxy , raining back down on the disk .",
    "dynamical considerations suggest that recently discovered molecular complex to the southeast of the galaxy is bound will also fall back into ngc 3077 rather than become a new dwarf galaxy .",
