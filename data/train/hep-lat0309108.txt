    "numerical stochastic perturbation theory ( nspt ) is a numerical method to perform lattice perturbation theory which has proven to be very powerful in the quenched approximation of lattice qcd . in recent years",
    "@xcite the unquenched version was introduced , whose first ( benchmark ) results were encouraging @xcite .",
    "the goal , which appears feasible , is to have nspt competitive on any @xmath0-@xmath1 loops computation of quantities like renormalization constants ( and possibly improvement coefficients , where needed ) for potentially any fermionic action .",
    "an obvious first benchmark one can go through is the quark propagator for wilson action . in other words ,",
    "one is computing @xmath2 to @xmath1 loops , for example matching to the ri scheme . in the following we only report on a byproduct , the critical mass for @xmath3 .",
    "for a comprehensive account of the formulae of unquenched nspt we refer the reader to @xcite . we briefly discuss instead the computational set - up .",
    "results are obtained on a @xmath4 lattice with @xmath3 wilson action .",
    "the relevant configurations are generated on a apemille crate ( @xmath5 fpu s for @xmath6 gflops of peak performance ) .",
    "smaller lattices to keep finite size effects under control are demanded to a pc cluster .",
    "stability with respect to single vs double precision has been tested .",
    "gauge is fixed ( where needed ) to the landau condition ( fourier acceleration has turned out to be very helpful ) . given the replication of the fields at every perturbative order , a single configuration on a @xmath4 lattice at @xmath1 loops ( _ i.e. _ @xmath7 ) level amounts to @xmath8 gb .",
    "we are collecting a large amount of configurations in order to set up a repository out of which any fermionic observable can be computed in perturbation theory to @xmath1 loops .",
    "as already stated , the configurations we have been generating up to now are at @xmath3 . given the polynomial dependence of fermionic observable on @xmath9 in perturbation theory",
    ", it will be easy to fit it once configurations will be available also at other value of @xmath9 .",
    "there is anyway a computation already on its way just now , which is that of the third order of the residual mass counterterm in lattice heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the goal is to extend the unquenched result for the b - quark mass @xcite to three loops accuracy for the perturbative subtraction which is needed to keep renormalons effects under control",
    ". an @xmath3 computation will be enough for this purpouse . in recent years",
    "other methods to compute the b - quark mass in completely non - perturbative ways have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the only unquenched computations available at the moment are anyway still the ones relying on hqet and perturbative subtractions of the residual mass , so we still think that it is worthwhile to proceed .",
    "the residual mass , as it was the case for the quenched case , is being computed out of the computation of the matching between lattice and potential scheme couplings , which in turns relies on computations of big wilson loops .",
    "quark bilinears are the obvious first quantities we are computing ( again , at @xmath3 level , at the moment ) in the quark sector of the theory . as a matter of fact also",
    "four fermions operators look feasible .",
    "at order @xmath10 as a function of @xmath11 ( @xmath3 ) in renormalized perturbation theory ( critical mass counterterm as known from analytical computations plugged in at one and two loops level ) . ]    the quark propagator ( which we denote by @xmath12 ) is our first benchmark computation among the quark bilinears . in nspt",
    "approach one actually computes @xmath13 and then proceeds to invert to get @xmath14 which is the quantity which actually encodes all the information .",
    "@xmath15 in turns goes like @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a pure lattice artifact ( actually diverging as @xmath18 ) . at @xmath19",
    "it is the well - known critical mass , the additive renormalization one has to subtract from the bare lagrangian mass in order to obtain the bare mass that gets multiplicatively renormalized .",
    "it is the only quantity we are actually going to report on here ( again , for @xmath3 ) .",
    "still it is worthwhile to note the features all @xmath20 share with respect to our nspt computation .",
    "as already stated , one first computes @xmath13 , then inverts to get @xmath21 and then projects on the ( dirac space ) identity and the @xmath22 in order to get the @xmath20 .",
    "of course one takes advantage of the colour simmetry to improve the accuracy .",
    "the dependences on @xmath11 and @xmath23 are completely known at one loop level , while those on @xmath11 and @xmath19 are known from continuum perturbation theory ( notice that from these one can elaborate on @xmath11 and @xmath23 dependence at @xmath0 and @xmath1 loops ) .",
    "the @xmath19 results are the ones we are interested in here ( they also define the point where one would like to compute in general the renormalization factors @xmath24 ) .",
    "we used two ir regulators in order to get the @xmath19 results .",
    "we both plugged small @xmath25 values in and subtracted zero modes in the @xmath19 simulations .",
    "results showed that we can control the procedure to a good accuracy . on the lattice at a finite value of the lattice spacing @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence on the lattice invariants one can construct as powers of @xmath27 are actually the natural handles for the @xmath28 limit .",
    "+ the first and second loop contribution to the critical mass are analytically known @xcite .",
    "for @xmath3 they read @xmath29     at order @xmath30 as a function of @xmath11 ( @xmath3 ) in renormalized perturbation theory ( same framework as in fig .",
    "[ fig : o1 ] ) . ]",
    "notice that once one knows these values , one actually has to plug them in as counterterms in nspt simulations ( to keep their contributions into account at higher loops ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : o1 ] we plot the component along the identity of @xmath31 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath17 , given the @xmath19 value ) at order @xmath10 .",
    "this is plotted against @xmath11 .",
    "the curve is not smooth since ( as we have already pointed out ) we know this is not a function of @xmath11 alone : the value extrapolated at @xmath32 is the quantity one is interested in . notice that this is what one would call renormalized ( with respect to the additive mass renormalization ) perturbation theory : one has plugged the first two counterterms in , so @xmath17 gets cancelled at one and two loops level .",
    "the confirmation of this at two loops level is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2 ] ( the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : o1 ] at @xmath30 order ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : o3 ] one can inspect that the result for the third order is within reach .",
    "we are not quoting a number at this preliminary stage , but the order of magnitude of the result is clear .",
    "notice , by the way , that we plot the result from a very reduced set of configurations at a fixed time - step ( in nspt one performs simulations at a fixed value of the time - step used in integrating langevin equation and then has to extrapolate to the continuum - time stochastic dynamics ) .",
    "we add just a few comments to have a rough idea of the order of magnitude of this new contribution to the ( perturbative ) critical mass .",
    "if one compares the perturbative result for the critical mass at three loops level with the one determined with non - perturbative methods , one finds that results are still quite far away from each other . to have an idea of the quite poor convergence of the series in the bare coupling : at @xmath33 the contribution of order @xmath7 is some @xmath34% that of order @xmath30 ( which is in turns @xmath35% that of order @xmath10 ) .",
    "by performing a three loops computation of the wilson action critical mass at @xmath3 we showed that three loops computations are indeed feasible in unquenched nspt .",
    "the goal is now to compute at this order various renormalization constants .",
