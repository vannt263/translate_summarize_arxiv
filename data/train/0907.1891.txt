    "sn1987a neutrino events @xcite prompted many dedicated analyses .",
    "even if the number of detected neutrinos is limited , these analyses provide interesting limits on neutrino properties and clues on the core collapse mechanism .",
    "the question of which likelihood should be adopted for supernova neutrino data analysis will become crucial after the next galactic supernova , when a much larger number of neutrino events will be collected .",
    "these events will carry information on neutrino properties mixed with information about supernova properties , so that we will need to jointly study their energy , time and direction distributions to try to extract all the relevant pieces of information .",
    "therefore it will remain unpractical to bin the events and an event - by - event likelihood will remain the best tool for data analysis .",
    "we present here the likelihood that should be ideally adopted for supernova neutrino data analysis .",
    "our likelihood is more general than those already present in the literature  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , we resolve discrepancies in the previous literature , numerically relevant already in the concrete case of sn1987a data .",
    "we argue , in particular , that the analysis of sn1987a neutrino data by lamb and loredo  @xcite ( ll ) , quoted since 2004 in the summary table of the particle data group  @xcite , uses a likelihood that incorrectly biases the analysis in favor of low energy events .",
    "we here present the correct likelihood , generalizing the ` traditional ' form , advocated , e.g. , by jegerlehner , neubig and raffelt  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ prim ] we derive the general form of the likelihood .",
    "the application to a specific case of interest is discussed in sect .",
    "[ thir ] . finally , in sect .",
    "[ four ] we compare our likelihood with other forms adopted for the analysis of sn1987a neutrinos , showing how the fitted parameters got biased .",
    "we write the expected event number in the @xmath0-th bin as : @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the time coordinate , while @xmath3 indicates the set of all other observables ( energy , position , direction , etc . ) which define the properties of the @xmath0-bin .",
    "we suppose that the bin sizes @xmath4 are infinitesimally small so that the condition @xmath5 holds true : therefore the probability that multiple events are collected in one bin is negligible and , thus , observing @xmath6 events corresponds to @xmath6 bins with 1 event , and all other bins with 0 events .    according to poissonian statistics ( see e.g. ,  appendix a of @xcite )",
    "the associated likelihood is : @xmath7   \\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n_{\\rm ev } }   n_i ,   \\label{l1}\\ ] ] where the sum in the exponent runs over all @xmath8 bins and gives the total number of expected events , while the product runs over all @xmath6 observed events .",
    "as usual , one can convert this into a @xmath9 distribution as @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider the case when the detected events are due to a signal @xmath11 , reprocessed in the detector through a response function @xmath12 , and to a known ( measured ) background process @xmath13 .",
    "we have : @xmath14 the second term in the r.h.s . takes into account that a signal produced at the time @xmath15 and with coordinates @xmath16 , due to detector response , could be observed with a probability @xmath17 at a different time @xmath18 and coordinate  @xmath19 .    by integrating over all possible detection times and coordinates , we introduce the general form of the detection efficiency : @xmath20 the efficiency obeys the condition",
    "@xmath21 , if we describe a situation when the events can be lost . by factoring out @xmath22",
    "we define the smearing ( or error ) function  @xmath23 @xmath24 normalized to unity : @xmath25 the background @xmath13 , the efficiency @xmath22 and the smearing @xmath23 describe the experimental apparatus . assuming that they are known , we can use an experimental result to learn on the signal @xmath11 , by the study of the likelihood function of eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) together with  ( [ dng ] ) .      in the case of interest , it is possible to further simplify the problem by relying on the following assumptions :    @xmath26 we assume that the response function factorizes in the time and in the coordinates as follows @xmath27 we introduce the time - independent efficiency in the observables @xmath28 , defined in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ edef ] ) : @xmath29 and the smearing function defined in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ gdef ] ) : @xmath30 again , it is normalized to unity : @xmath31 we will discuss later the specific form of these expressions for sn1987a .",
    "@xmath32 if the time @xmath18 is measured with negligible error , we have @xmath33 possibly multiplied by a window function @xmath34 to account for the dead time @xmath35 after an event , due to supernova or to background ( for example , a muon ) , has been recorded .",
    "concerning sn1987a data , only the _ relative _ time between events of the detectors was measured precisely ; one needs to take into account the uncertainty in the absolute time of the kamiokande - ii and baksan events .",
    "@xmath36 we can finally assume that the background does not depend on the time , namely @xmath37 possibly , multiplied by @xmath34 to take into account for the absence of any events , including those due to background , during dead time .",
    "( [ btdef ] ) implies that the background can be _ measured _ in the period when the signal is absent ( as for sn1987a ) .    with these assumptions , eq .",
    "( [ dng ] ) simplifies to : @xmath38 then , assuming that the @xmath6 events @xmath3 have been measured at time @xmath2 , the likelihood in eq .",

    ", we  get @xmath40 . \\end{array }",
    "\\label{l3 }   \\label{alfin}\\ ] ] this form of the likelihood is general enough for the purpose of analyzing sn1987a neutrinos .",
    "moreover , this is a generalization of the likelihood advocated in @xcite for the study of radioactive decays , when the time of occurence of each event is measured .",
    "as we already discussed , the dead time can be taken into account by extending the time integral in the exponent only to the time when the detector is on , thereby removing the time intervals where data taking was stopped after each candidate signal event .",
    "as long as @xmath35 is small enough , one can equivalently take into account the dead time due to background events by multiplying the integrand in the exponent of  ( [ alfin ] ) by the average live - time fraction , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the time - averaged background event rate .",
    "compare it with the discussion of @xcite , further elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "in order to specify the general formul , we choose a concrete and important example : we discuss the likelihood for the water erenkov detector kamiokande - ii .      in this subsection",
    ", we collect some useful definitions .",
    "the variables that characterize an event are : @xmath43 for concreteness , we consider events resulting from the reaction @xmath44 when a positron is detected through its erenkov light ; similar considerations apply to the elastic scattering reaction or the charged current reactions with nuclei .    in the construction of the likelihood",
    "3 different directions are relevant : the direction @xmath45 of sn1987a ; the _ reconstructed _ direction @xmath46 of each event ; the _ true _",
    "direction @xmath47 of the positrons produced by the detection process . for each event , the first 2 directions are fixed , while we have to integrate on the true direction of the positron , taking into account the detector response and the reconstructed event direction , as described in eq .",
    "( [ alfin ] ) . to do this , it is convenient to use an `` event - centric '' system in which : + 1 ) the reconstructed positron direction is along the @xmath48 axis , @xmath49 2 ) the true positron direction is in the generic direction : @xmath50 so that @xmath51 thus , @xmath52 is the opening angle around the reconstructed direction and @xmath53 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the experimental collaborations usually quote the error on the angle @xmath54 between the true and the reconstructed direction for each bin ( rather than the the error on the direction versor @xmath55 itself ) .",
    "+ 3 ) finally , we have the versor @xmath45 pointing in the direction of the supernova .",
    "this , without loosing in generality , can be chosen in the plane @xmath56 : @xmath57 so that @xmath58      in the simplest approximation , we can describe the smearing function by assuming that it factorizes according to : @xmath59 where we denote by @xmath60 a standard gaussian in @xmath61 dimensions .",
    "we include a normalization factor @xmath62 to describe the presence of physical boundaries , like e.g. , the fact that @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] when we integrate over the possible directions of @xmath47 .",
    "the quantities @xmath65 are functions of the variables of eq .",
    "( [ esamp ] ) .",
    "we identify @xmath65 in the point @xmath66 with the error for the @xmath0-th event quoted by the experimental collaborations , e.g. , @xmath67 thus , we further approximate the smearing function : @xmath68 in the vicinity of each point where the likelihood should be evaluated  see eq .",
    "( [ alfin ] ) . ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 , by @xmath71 .",

    "the angular distribution requires , instead , a more detailed discussion .",
    "first , we discuss the connection between the error @xmath69 to be inserted into eq .",
    "( [ errors ] ) and the 1-sigma error on angle @xmath72 indicated by the experimental collaborations . in the gaussian assumption",
    ", the function @xmath73 can be written as : @xmath74 where the function @xmath75 , given by : @xmath76 , \\label{aaa1}\\ ] ] describes the distribution of the angle @xmath77 between the true and the reconstructed direction ; the azimuthal angle @xmath53 is uniformly distributed as appropriate for an unbiased detector .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath78 can be explicitely calculated @xmath79 and it is very close to one for the typical case @xmath80 .",
    "we calculate @xmath69 by requiring that : @xmath81 for the 1 sigma error @xmath54 corresponds to the @xmath82 confidence level . for small @xmath69 , we get easily : @xmath83 typically the first term provides an adequate approximation for the quantity we search , @xmath69 .",
    "now , we discuss a possible improvement of the gaussian assumption for the distribution @xmath73 .",
    "experimental investigations of the super - kamiokande collaboration  @xcite have shown that the tails of the angular distribution fall slower than @xmath84 and resemble more closely @xmath85 ; compare also with app .",
    "c of  @xcite .",

    "( [ er1 ] ) , the first term is typically sufficient .",

    "our derivation of the likelihood function reveals errors in previous attempts to account for the energy dependence of the efficiencies of the neutrino detectors ; we show that these errors significantly corrupt previous inferences .",
    "_ indeed , the likelihood advocated by ll has been shown to have an important impact for the analysis of data also by similar and independent analyses of sn1987a observations @xcite .",
    "we would like , however , to draw the discussion on the correctness of the likelihood of ll .",
    "we see that the ll expression , eq .",
    "( [ lll ] ) , coincides with our eq .",
    "( [ prat ] ) _ only if we identify _ the function @xmath122 with the energy response function of the detector : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the gaussian smearing of eq .",

    "this is not the case for ll who instead claim ( see their eq .",
    "( 3.21 ) ) : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is assumed to be the maximum energy where the efficiency vanishes ( i.e. , the minimum detectable energy ) and @xmath127 is the step function .    the only special case in which the ll likelihood coincides with our result is when the average efficiency is assumed to be a step function @xmath128 . in general ,",
    "this is not the case and the efficiency is a continuously growing function of the energy .",
    "the ll likelihood therefore incorrectly biases the analysis in favor of low energy events .",
    "the quantitative effect of this bias on data analysis will be discussed further in sect .",
    "[ qqq ] .    the above remarks amount to the consideration that the likelihood of lamb and loredo does _ not _ follow from the formal construction described in sects .  [ prim ] and [ thir ] . however , it is instructive to point out more directly the profound principle problem of the ll likelihood .",

    "this expression is supposed to have a general validity . then consider a simple limiting case : only one bin , with dimension @xmath130 and with energy above @xmath126 ; no background , @xmath131 ; a constant signal , @xmath132 ; a constant efficiency , @xmath133 ; a perfect energy resolution , @xmath134 ; a very small expected number of events , @xmath135 . in these assumptions ,",
    "the most probable outcome is the case @xmath136 , followed by the case @xmath137 ; the probability of other possible results is negligible . from eq .",
    "( [ pll ] ) , we calculate the probabilites of the cases when no event and one event are observed : @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "their sum violates the basic principle according to which the sum of the probability for all possible results should be equal to one .",
    "we comment here on a likelihood that was _ not _ proposed for the analysis of supernova neutrinos , but that it is strictly connected with the previous one .    the same position as in eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) was made in @xcite , where loredo defines the quantity @xmath140 .",
    "this quantity , that evidently corresponds to the quantity @xmath122 discussed above , is claimed to be independent on the detection efficiency .",
    "this position caused the criticism of loredo @xcite to the likelihood advocated for the analysis of trans - neptunian objects of bernstein _ et al . _",
    "2004 @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( a8 ) of  @xcite ) .",
    "again , we find the position of @xcite unjustified , while we agree with @xcite . in particular , eq .",
    "( a4 ) of @xcite expresses the statement that the response function _ does _ contain the detection efficiency ; it corresponds strictly to our eq .",
    "( [ edef ] ) .",
    "finally , in the analyses performed by some of us @xcite , eq .  ( [ prat ] ) was used , simplified to the case @xmath141 to take into account the mild angular dependence of the @xmath44 reaction .",

    "let us begin by considering the conventional exponential cooling model , in which the @xmath142 temperature decreases exponentially with the time and the neutrino - radius @xmath143 is constant .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the use of eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) rather than eq .",
    "( [ right ] ) leads to important differences on the inferred values of the parameters .",
    "we note in particular that the ( well - known ) difference between @xmath143 and the expected size of the neutron star radius , @xmath144  km , is amplified when we adopt eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) ( i.e. , when we bias the analysis ) .",
    "this outcome can be easily understood : the bias in favor of low energy events implies that @xmath145 ( that is proportional to the average energy of the electron antineutrinos ) will decrease ; thus , @xmath143 has to increase to keep the number of events constant .     and the initial temperature @xmath145 obtained from two analyses of sn1987a data based on the exponential cooling model . when eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) is adopted , there is a good agreement between the results of @xcite ( dotted line ) and those of @xcite ( dashed line ) ; the small discrepancies can be ascribed to the different statistical procedures ( bayesian in @xcite and frequentist in @xcite ) and to a different numerical treatment of the data .",
    "the effect of switching from eq .",
    "( [ wrong ] ) ( dashed line ) to eq .",
    "( [ right ] ) ( continuous line ) is much more significant @xcite .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=34.0% ]    the bias will be even more important for the analysis of a future galactic supernova , since the number of collected events will be much larger and the errors on the parameters are expected to scale as the square root of the number of the events .    indeed , the analysis of the 29 events collected by kamiokande - ii , imb and baksan in an extension of the exponential cooling model leads to @xmath146 km and @xmath147 mev @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of simulated events from a future supernova , that assumed the same antineutrino emission model ( that includes an initial phase of intense emission ) , the same central values as found from sn1987a ( in particular , @xmath148 km and @xmath149 mev ) , and a supernova located at a distance of 20 kpc ( i.e. , a data set 30 times larger ) , leads to the conclusions that the parameters are correctly reconstructed when we use eq .",
