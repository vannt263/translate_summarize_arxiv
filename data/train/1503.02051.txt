    "preisach model @xcite , with its roots originated in magnetism @xcite , is well - suitable for describing various rate - independent hysteresis phenomena in a closed input - output analytic form .",

    "over the plane @xmath4 ( left ) and input - output curves @xmath5)(t)$ ] of the preisach operator ( right ) . ]    according to the representation theorem of mayergoyz , the preisach hysteresis model can be fitted to any set of input - output data that possesses two properties : the so - called wiping - out of local input extremum values and congruency of any two hysteresis loops created by the same two consecutive input extrema ; see @xcite for more details of the formalism and properties of the preisach hysteresis model .",
    "the use of models of hysteresis in magnetism , as well as in other natural , engineering , and social sciences , confronts with problems of identification of parameters , which requires to obtain a sufficient number of observations of hysteresis system states @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological nature of the preisach model , which is based on superposition of multiple elementary hysteresis operators called non - ideal relays ( switches ) , and the representation theorem of mayergoyz allow to apply the model to various hysteretic systems using a phenomenological argument or the black box approach without complex analysis of such systems based on first principles @xcite . importantly",
    ", the representation theorem provides the preisach model with straightforward means for identification of parameters from dedicated input - output data . here",
    "it should be recalled that the preisach model is entirely parameterized by the so - called preisach density function @xmath6 defined over the @xmath7 plane , as schematically shown in figure 1 ( left ) .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 coordinates , with @xmath10 , are the ` on ' and ` off ' switching thresholds of a single relay operator , and the @xmath11-function represents the weighted @xmath4-distribution of these relays over the possible threshold values .",
    "each relay switches from state @xmath12 ( ` off ' ) to state @xmath13 ( ` on ' ) and backwards in response to variations of the same input time series called the input @xmath14 of the preisach model ; the output time series @xmath15 of the model is defined as the sum of states of all the relays .",
    "the identification algorithm of mayergoyz requires to discretize the preisach model and assumes a sufficient number of measured first - order descending ( fod ) input - output curves @xcite",
    ". the higher the required accuracy of hysteresis modeling is , the smaller the discrete step on the @xmath7 plane should be ( cf . with figure 1 , left ) , and the more accurate fod curve measurements are required .",
    "the volume of data , which should be first recorded before the direct mayergoyz identification method can be applied for calculation of the density function @xmath11 , rapidly increases with increasing target accuracy .    from this point of view , the motivation for this work is to explore the possibilities of applying recursive / iterative identification methods for which only the previous ( or , a few recent ) values of the input - output data stream should be available at any instant .",
    "recursive ( also known as on - line ) identification methods can be required when dealing with time - varying processes , i.e. , where the hysteresis behavior changes ( usually slowly ) with time depending on certain non - controllable operational or environmental conditions , such as varying ambient temperature , force fields , temporal relaxation , etc .",
    "the applicability of the direct mayergoyz identification method can also be limited by a strong uncontrollable noise capable of corrupting the designed test input signal .",
    "furthermore , in various engineering applications which use hysteresis models , e.g. , for process monitoring or control , a simplified identification with no special ( expert ) knowledge as for design of dedicated input processes ( such as a process creating the fod curves ) can be required . here",
    "an algorithm which is capable of using data generated by a stochastic input processes ( with certain well - defined properties ) may be advantageous .    surprisingly , little number of recursive methods suitable for identification of parameters of the preisach hysteresis model has been analyzed theoretically or experimentally .",
    "a gradient - based recursive identification scheme has been proposed in @xcite and experimentally evaluated on a magnetostrictive actuator system which exhibits hysteresis between the relative displacement and the actuator current .",
    "the error convergence for this scheme has been estimated for relatively rough discretization of the @xmath7 plane ( up to 25 steps in the input domain ) .",
    "another direct recursive identification method has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method updates the values of the preisach density function in the so - called switching region of the @xmath7 plane , which defines an output increment in response to a random input increment at each iteration step .",
    "this method has been tested and evaluated numerically in the context of modeling the hysteretic constitutive relationship between the magnetic field and magnetization in a ferromagnetic material .",
    "however no rigorous analysis of the convergence and its properties , such as the convergence rate , has been done insofar .    in this paper , we prove the exponential convergence of the recursive identification algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "we first show that the error of the algorithm monotonically decreases ( section [ sec2 ] ) and establish an estimate for the rate of convergence for any input time series ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "our main result ( section [ sec4 ] ) establishes that the error @xmath16 almost surely converges to zero exponentially , @xmath17 , with the rate satisfying an explicit estimate @xmath18 if the input time series generates a regular markov chain in the space of states of the preisach model ( the latter condition is generic and is satisfied for a wide class of input markov processes ) . here",
    "@xmath19 is a function of the number of nodes in the domain of the density function on the @xmath4 plane , @xmath20 is a certain stopping time associated with the input process , and @xmath21 are the mean values of @xmath20 and its inverse . essentially , @xmath20 is the length of the time interval during which fluctuations of the input randomly create all the segments of all the fod input - output curves prescribed by the classical mayergoyz identification algorithm . if all this information was recorded , a complete identification of the density function was achievable from the input - output data collected within @xmath20 time steps .",
    "the recursive algorithm considered here is not capable of recovering the density function exactly as it updates the approximation to the density function at each time step without recording past input - output data .",
    "however , we guarantee that the error decreases by a certain percentage over @xmath20 time steps , @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth noting that the random time @xmath20 is a characteristic of the input process .",
    "overall , our estimates suggest that the smaller the mean value of @xmath20 is and the less nodes the grid has ( smaller @xmath19 ) , the faster is the guaranteed exponential convergence of the recursive algorithm .",
    "we test these conclusions by considering two examples of random input processes and comparing their rates of convergence in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "let @xmath23 be a density function of the preisach operator where @xmath24 denotes a point in the half - plane @xmath25 .",
    "each point @xmath26 represents a non - ideal relay with the threshold values @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath27 the subset of the half - plane @xmath28 where relays are ` on ' ( in state 1 ) at a moment @xmath29 ( we normalize the time step to 1 ) ; the other relays are ` off ' ( in state 0 ) .",
    "then the output @xmath30 of the preisach model at this moment equals @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the set @xmath33 is called the state of the preisach model .",
    "the state @xmath33 and the output @xmath34 change in response to variations of the input @xmath35 of the model as the non - ideal relays switch between states 0 and 1 . for discrete time input series , which is the case considered here , @xmath36",
    "this rule defines the time series of the state and output , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , for any given input sequence @xmath37 , @xmath38 and a given initial state @xmath39 ( see , for example , @xcite for more details ) .    in the following identification algorithm we use an estimate @xmath40 , @xmath41 of the density function , which is updated at each moment @xmath42 .",
    "the estimate @xmath43 of the output and the error @xmath44 between the observed and modeled output values equal , respectively , @xmath45 comparing states @xmath33 and @xmath46 , denote @xmath47 .",
    "this is the set of those relays that switch on during the time step from @xmath42 to @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , consider the set @xmath49 of relays that switch off during the same time step .",
    "then , over this time step , the error between the observed output and the output modeled with the density function @xmath50 receives the increment @xmath51    following @xcite , we update the estimate of the true density function @xmath11 according to the formula @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the area of the switching region @xmath54 .",
    "let us first show that the mean square distance between the exact and estimated density is monotonically non - increasing with iterations .    for any initial estimate @xmath55 ,",
    "the mean square distance @xmath56 between @xmath50 and @xmath11 is a non - increasing function of @xmath57 .    _",
    "proof_. according to the update rule , @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 we see that @xmath62 hence the mean square distance between the exact and estimated preisach density functions not only never increases , but actually strictly decreases each time the output increment error @xmath63 is non - zero . the aim of the following argument is to show that , for reasonable inputs , the error @xmath64 is non - zero `` often enough '' ( as long as @xmath65 ) to ensure the exponential convergence @xmath66 .",
    "from now on , we will consider the discretized version of the preisach model .",
    "we will assume that the input is a discrete markov process @xmath67 with @xmath68 states @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "in this discrete setting , the set @xmath72 of all possible states @xmath73 of the model is also finite .",
    "furthermore , we can assume without loss of generality that the density @xmath11 ( as well as its approximations @xmath50 ) is concentrated at the finite set of nodes @xmath74 that form a uniform rectangular mesh within the right triangle @xmath75 of the half - plane @xmath28 ; these nodes will be denoted @xmath76 , where @xmath77 with the total number of nodes @xmath78 .",
    "in other words , we consider the density functions of the form @xmath79 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale the mesh step to unity by setting @xmath80 and , simultaneously , setting @xmath81 in the update rule with @xmath82 denoting the number of the mesh nodes in the switching region @xmath54 .",
    "we note that for this discrete model , at each time step either @xmath83 , @xmath84 or @xmath85 , @xmath86 . with this notation",
    ", formula can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath16 is the error @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "relationship can be also written as @xmath90    we define the rate of convergence of the iterative scheme as @xmath91    in order to estimate the rate of convergence of the identification algorithm , we will use a certain stopping time @xmath20 associated with the input process . with a given realization of the input process @xmath67 we associate successive time intervals @xmath92 during each time interval we require the process to create a set of preisach states satisfying the following properties .",
    "we require that for every node @xmath76 there would be two states @xmath93 and @xmath94 achieved at two successive moments within the time interval @xmath95 $ ] such that @xmath96 where @xmath97 as soon as this requirement is satisfied for all the nodes @xmath98 , @xmath77 , of the mesh , the new time interval @xmath99 $ ] starts .",
    "the set is a right triangle with the vertex @xmath100 and the hypothenuse on the line @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we will simply say that the input creates all the possible triangles on the half - plane @xmath28 within each time interval @xmath95 $ ] .    for example , this requirement will be satisfied if for every @xmath98 there will be three successive time moments @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 during the time interval @xmath99 $ ] such that either @xmath105 for some @xmath106 , or @xmath107 for some @xmath108 .",
    "a less restrictive requirement is that the same holds but the moments @xmath42 , @xmath109 are not necessarily successive and the input stays between @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 in the first case ( between @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath112 in the second case ) .",
