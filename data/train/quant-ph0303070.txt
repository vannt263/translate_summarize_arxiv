    "a central question of quantum information science is to determine the minimal time required to perform a quantum computation using a set of physical resources known to be universal for computation .",
    "our understanding of what resources are universal for computation is very well - developed , and it is known   that when fast local control is available , any unitary dynamics capable of generating entanglement is universal for computation . however , the question of using these resources in a time - optimal fashion is , by comparison , understood relatively poorly .",
    "this paper considers a particular simplified setting , that of time - optimal simulation of two - qubit unitaries using a fixed interaction hamiltonian and arbitrary fast local control .",
    "arbitrary fast local control means that the evolution of the interaction hamiltonian may be interrupted by arbitrary single - qubit operations , and that these operations take no time to perform .",
    "this assumption corresponds to certain experimental setups where single - qubit operations are performed on a much faster time scale than joint operations .",
    "hammerer , vidal and cirac @xcite have given a construction for this simulation , as well as an elegant expression for the minimum achievable simulation time .",
    "the simulation scheme of hammerer _ et al . _",
    "uses , in general , an infinite number of steps to achieve time optimality .",
    "that is , the interaction hamiltonian is , in general , interrupted an infinite number of times by local operations , and the time between each interruption is infinitesimal .",
    "a simulation scheme requiring infinitely many time steps is not practical for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the original premise that local operations can be performed in zero time is no longer valid if one must perform infinitely many of them .",
    "second , the effects of noise on such a simulation will overwhelm the intended coherent dynamics .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to ask , first , whether infinitely many time steps are actually _ required _ , in general , for time - optimal simulation ?",
    "we will find that the answer is yes .",
    "indeed , we will show that the overwhelming majority of two - qubit interaction hamiltonians have this property . given this",
    ", we then address the question of determining how close to time optimal a simulation can get , given that one demands a simulation using only a finite number of time steps .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : preliminaries ] we review results about two - qubit time - optimal simulation in the limit of fast control . in sec .",
    "[ sec : procedure ] we provide a procedure for determining which two - qubit hamiltonians require infinitesimal time steps when used in this setting . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : finite ] we quantify the sacrifice that must be made to time - optimality when one insists on having a simulation using a finite number of time steps .",

    "an arbitrary two - qubit hamiltonian can be parameterised as follows : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real 3-vectors , @xmath3 is a 3 by 3 real matrix , and @xmath4 is the vector of pauli operators .",

    "a simulation scheme to approximate an arbitrary two - qubit unitary , @xmath7 , using a fixed hamiltonian , @xmath10 , and arbitrary local unitaries may , without loss of generality , be written as follows .",
    "@xmath11 where the parameters @xmath12 are nonnegative .",
    "that is , in order to achieve the desired dynamics @xmath7 we can apply @xmath10 as many times as we wish for arbitrary lengths of time , interspersed with arbitrary operations on the individual qubits .",
    "we occasionally refer to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scheme ] ) as being a _ circuit _ for @xmath7 .",
    "it is worth noting that the assumption that @xmath10 contains no @xmath13 term and that single - qubit unitaries are in @xmath9 , implies that @xmath7 is in @xmath14 .",
    "these restrictions entail no loss in generality , as they simply take advantage of the fact that the global phase of a unitary operator is irrelevant .",

    "the local parts @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21 , and @xmath22 of the canonical decomposition do not affect the interaction time , as they can be trivially included in the first and last steps , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , of a simulation . therefore the canonical - form parameters are all we need to know about @xmath7 in order to calculate the minimum required interaction time for eq .",
    "( [ eq : scheme ] ) .",
    "how does one calculate the canonical - form parameters ?",
    "for completeness , we review the method given in appendix a of  @xcite .    in the following",

    "@xcite , @xmath30 it is known  @xcite that , when expressed in the magic basis , local two - qubit special unitaries are real , and canonical - form unitaries are diagonal .",
    "this means that in the magic basis the canonical decomposition looks like @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real orthogonal matrices , and @xmath34 is diagonal .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath34 can be easily written in terms of the canonical - form parameters of @xmath7 : if we define @xmath35 then the diagonal elements of @xmath34 are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdaj ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : order ] ) implies that @xmath40    we have that @xmath41 , so the eigenvalues of @xmath42 are just the squares of the diagonal elements of @xmath34 .",
    "that is , @xmath43    to determine the canonical - form parameters for a particular @xmath7 , we first calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath42 ( where the transpose is taken in the magic basis ) , then derive the @xmath44 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigutu ] ) , and finally solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lambdaj ] ) . a word of caution : the task of deriving the @xmath44 from the @xmath45 is not as trivial as it may first seem .",
    "the problem is that , in general , there is no guarantee that the values @xmath46 will lie in any particular branch of the logarithm function .",
    "so , naively taking the _ argument _ of @xmath45 will not necessarily give you @xmath47 .",
    "a relatively simple procedure exists to correct for this problem  @xcite .",
    "however in the context of sec .",
    "[ sec : procedure ] we will see later that taking the logarithm of @xmath45 along the standard branch of the logarithm function will suffice to evaluate @xmath46 .",
    "closely related to the canonical form for a two - qubit unitary is the canonical form for a two - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "it is discussed in section v.a of @xcite , where it is referred to as the _ normal _ form . given the purely nonlocal part @xmath48 of a hamiltonian @xmath10 , when it is expressed in the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , the canonical form of @xmath10 is defined to be the unique hermitian operator@xmath49 that satisfies @xmath50 for some local unitary @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of this canonical form is established in @xcite , where it is shown that @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the singular values of the matrix @xmath3 , and @xmath56 .",
    "the canonical form of a hamiltonian @xmath10 encapsulates the nonlocal behaviour of the evolution of @xmath10 for very small time steps .",
    "this can be seen as follows . from sections iii.b and v.a of @xcite we can write @xmath57 for some local unitaries @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath34 . to order @xmath61 , the evolution of @xmath10 is given by a unitary having canonical - form parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .      we are almost ready to review the expression for @xmath16 given in @xcite . before we do",
    "so we review the concept of _ special - majorization_. special - majorization describes a particular type of partial ordering of three - vectors .",
    "its use in @xcite allows certain results to be described very succinctly .",
    "to define special - majorization , it is necessary to first introduce the idea of a _ special - ordered _ three - vector . given a real vector @xmath65 , the corresponding _ special - ordered _",
    "vector @xmath66 is defined as follows .",
    "the absolute value of the components of @xmath66 are given by the absolute value of the components of @xmath67 rearranged in nonincreasing order .",
    "that is , @xmath68 for the permutation @xmath69 that gives @xmath70 and @xmath71 are nonnegative , and that @xmath72 has the same sign as the product @xmath73 .",
    "then , @xmath67 is said to be special - majorized by @xmath74 ( denoted @xmath75 ) if @xmath76 where @xmath66 and @xmath77 are the special - ordered versions of @xmath67 and @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a two - qubit hamiltonian having canonical form @xmath78 and let @xmath7 be a two - qubit unitary having canonical form @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath16 , the minimum time required to simulate @xmath7 using @xmath10 , is given by the minimum value of @xmath80 such that either @xmath81 holds .",
    "we now introduce the the central concept of a `` lazy '' hamiltonian . for a given two - qubit hamiltonian @xmath10",
    ", we define a function @xmath82 as follows : @xmath83 that is , @xmath82 is the minimum total time for which the hamiltonian @xmath10 must be applied , when it is being used together with arbitrary local unitaries , to simulate its own action @xmath84 .",
    "such a simulation would be of the form @xmath85    the trivial `` simulation '' having the single step @xmath84 has an interaction time of @xmath61 .",
    "thus the minimum achievable interaction time will be no greater than @xmath61 : @xmath86 under what circumstances will @xmath82 be less than @xmath61 ?",
    "it turns out that this question is very closely linked to our main question : what are the circumstances under which a time - optimal simulation will require infinitesimal time steps ?    consider the class of two - qubit hamiltonians having the following property : @xmath87 we shall say that a hamiltonian is `` lazy '' if it is nonlocal and satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : lazy ] ) .",
    "[ prop : lazy ] if a hamiltonian is lazy , then the time - optimal simulation of any two - qubit nonlocal unitary @xmath7 using @xmath10 requires infinitely many time steps .",
    "* proof : * suppose there exists a time - optimal simulation scheme , of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scheme ] ) , for a nonlocal @xmath7 using a lazy hamiltonian @xmath10 , where the number of time steps @xmath88 is finite .",
    "at least one of the @xmath12 must be nonzero , otherwise the simulation would be unable to produce nonlocal dynamics .",
    "for such a nonzero @xmath12 , consider the corresponding factor @xmath89 in the simulation . since @xmath10 is lazy",
    ", there exists a simulation for @xmath89 having an interaction time _ less _ than @xmath12 .",
    "if we substitute such a simulation for @xmath89 back into the simulation for @xmath7 , then the new simulation for @xmath7 now has a lesser interaction time than it did before .",
    "however this contradicts the assumption that the original simulation was time optimal .",
    "hence the premise that the original simulation had finite time steps is false .",
    "thus we conclude that any lazy hamiltonian will require infinitesimal time steps when used for the time - optimal simulation of any nonlocal two - qubit unitary @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath90    to show that a particular @xmath10 is lazy , it is sufficient to show that @xmath91 for all @xmath61 in some interval @xmath92 for any positive @xmath93 . to see this , note that if there is a simulation for @xmath84 with interaction time @xmath94 , then clearly there exists a simulation for @xmath95 with interaction time @xmath96 , for any positive integer @xmath97 .",
    "thus , @xmath91 implies that @xmath98 for all positive integers @xmath97 .",
    "so , if @xmath91 for all @xmath99 , then @xmath91 for all @xmath100 .",
    "which two - qubit hamiltonians are lazy ? we have seen in the previous section ( proposition  [ prop : lazy ] ) that lazy two - qubit hamiltonians require infinitely many time steps if they are to be used for time - optimal control , and thus are impractical . in this section",
    "we provide a simple set of sufficient conditions for a hamiltonian to be lazy , expressed in terms of the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the parameterisation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is more general than it needs to be for this purpose .",
    "we can simplify matters by using the fact that a hamiltonian @xmath10 is lazy if and only if @xmath101 is lazy , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are any single - qubit unitaries .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath84 has the same canonical form as @xmath102 .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we choose to only consider hamiltonians where the purely nonlocal part is in canonical form , that is @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "recall from subsection [ sec : lazy ] that we define a hamiltonian to be lazy if @xmath91 over some interval @xmath92 .",
    "suppose we could find a taylor series expansion @xmath105 for @xmath82 in the variable @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath106 then , because we can assume @xmath61 is small , the corresponding hamiltonian is lazy if and only if the first nonzero item in the list @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ,  is negative .",
    "our procedure involves finding expressions for the first few items in that list , in terms of the parameters @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the hamiltonian .",
    "we then find the conditions under which each expression will be negative .",
    "we find that in fact @xmath114 always , and so @xmath110 is the first term that may be negative .",
    "accordingly , in the analysis that follows we consider the behaviour of @xmath82 up to order @xmath115 , so as to arrive at some nontrivial conditions for a hamiltonian being lazy .",
    "we seek expressions for the taylor coefficients of @xmath82 , namely , @xmath107 , @xmath116 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "the expression for @xmath16 involves the canonical - form parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the unitary @xmath7 .",
    "so we first try to find expressions for the canonical - form parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 of the unitary @xmath84 . from subsection",
    "[ sec : canon ] , the canonical - form parameters can be expressed in terms of parameters @xmath120 ,  , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 with the transpose taken in the magic basis .",
    "thus , @xmath123 where the vector of integers @xmath124 accounts for the ambiguity in taking the argument , and where the down - arrow sorts in decreasing order so that we are in agreement with the ordering of the @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdaorder ] ) .",
    "however , since we are only interested in the behaviour over a small interval @xmath125 $ ] , it turns out we can take @xmath126 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "from the discussion at the end of subsection [ sec : chu ] , for small @xmath61 the canonical - form parameters of @xmath84 will be small .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath127  @xmath128 will also be small . but",
    "this can only be the case when @xmath126 .",

    "similar conclusions can be reached in the general case by following a similar argument to that below , and making use of the results of  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the minimum time for simulating a cnot is @xmath214 where @xmath53 is the largest canonical - form parameter of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "when @xmath10 is lazy , can we construct a simulation using a finite number of time steps such that the total interaction time is not much larger than the optimum @xmath215 ?",
    "such a scheme is given in @xcite , whereby an arbitrary nonlocal two - qubit unitary @xmath7 is applied a finite number of times together with local unitaries to simulate a cnot . using the scheme in  @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath7 has largest canonical - form parameter @xmath23 such that @xmath216 is an integer greater than one , then the scheme can be used to simulate a cnot by applying @xmath7 exactly @xmath97 times .",
    "of course , we are interested in the case when @xmath217 , that is @xmath7 is given by the evolution of an interaction hamiltonian over a time @xmath218 . the total interaction time would then be @xmath219 from the previous section , the function @xmath220 can be written , for small @xmath218 , as @xmath221 thus , for small @xmath218 , @xmath222 this shows that to simulate a cnot gate by applying a lazy interaction hamiltonian in a ( finite ) number of small time - steps , then the penalty in the total interaction time , as compared with the optimum , is only of order @xmath223 .",
    "as an example , consider a specific interaction hamiltonian @xmath224 .",
    "using the results of the previous section it can easily be verified that @xmath10 is lazy .",
    "the graph of @xmath220 as a function of @xmath218 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric ] .",
    "we choose a range of positive integer values of @xmath97 , and for each @xmath97 we calculate how long the corresponding time step ( @xmath218 ) is by numerically solving @xmath225 no solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : solveit ] ) exists for @xmath226 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that @xmath227 , which is greater than the maximum value that @xmath220 takes .",
    "for @xmath97 equal to 8 or greater , a corresponding @xmath218 can be found .",
    "finally , the interaction time @xmath196 required to simulate the cnot is calculated via eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] .",
    "the dashed line is the optimal time , @xmath228 .",
    "the results clearly show a near - optimal simulation with relatively small numbers of time steps . for 20 time steps ,",
    "the total interaction time is just @xmath229 percent greater than the optimal .",
    "we have defined a class of `` lazy '' two - qubit hamiltonians , those which can simulate themselves faster with the aid of fast local control than with uninterrupted evolution . when a lazy hamiltonian is used in the time - optimal simulation of any nonlocal two - qubit unitary",
    ", we have shown that the simulation will require an infinite number of steps , and thus will be impractical .",
    "we have derived a simple set of sufficient conditions enabling us to prove that a given hamiltonian is lazy .",
    "this set of conditions implies that almost all two - qubit hamiltonians are lazy .",
    "finally , we have shown that only a rather small sacrifice in the simulation time needs to be made in order to use a lazy hamiltonian in a finite - step simulation .",
    "thanks to chris dawson for helpful discussions and for suggesting the name `` lazy '' hamiltonian .",
    "thanks also to guifr vidal for enlightening discussions .",
