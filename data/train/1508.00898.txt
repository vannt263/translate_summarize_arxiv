    "although the age ordering of these young associations is well - constrained i.e. the ab dor moving group is older than the tucana - horologium moving group ( tuc - hor ) , which in turn is older than the @xmath2 pic moving group ( bpmg ) , the absolute ages of these groups are still under - constrained .",
    "theoretical model isochrones are ( arguably ) the most commonly used method of age - dating young ( presumably coeval ) stellar populations . although the use of maximum - likelihood fitting techniques to subjectively fit model isochrones has been used for more distant galactic clusters ( e.g. ngc  2547 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* naylor & jeffries 2006 ) ) , such methods have not yet been applied to the young groups within @xmath5 . additionally , for these young groups there has been a distinct lack of homogeneity when it comes to the fitting of model isochrones , particularly in terms of the models adopted and the photometric bandpasses used to construct the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",

    "we provide a self - consistent , absolute isochronal age scale for young ( @xmath7 ) moving groups within 100pc of the sun .",

    "we find that the isochronal ages for both the bpmg and tuc - hor are consistent with recent ldb ages , thereby instilling confidence in our isochronal age scale .",
    "in this contribution we focus on the young , nearby moving groups within 100pc ; specifically the ab dor moving group , argus association , bpmg , carina association , columba association , @xmath9 cha cluster , tuc - hor , tw hya association ( twa ) , and 32 ori group ( see also the recent review by ( * ? ? ?",

    "* malo et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , we require that any candidate members have a measured radial velocity and/or trigonometric parallax which are / is consistent with membership for a given young group .",
    "our sample of members ( not accounting for unresolved multiples ) includes 89 members of the ab dor moving group , 27 members of argus , 97 members of the bpmg , 12 members of carina , 50 members of columba , 18 members of @xmath9 cha , 189 members of tuc - hor , 30 members of twa , and 14 members of 32 ori .    whilst all of our members have counterparts in the two - micron all - sky survey point source catalog ( 2mass psc ; ( * ?",
    "* cutri et al . 2003 ) ) , near - ir cmds are not ideal for age determination primarily because for @xmath11 the loci of young clusters becomes vertical ( @xmath12 ) , and hence degenerate with age .",
    "therefore we supplement our near - ir photometry with @xmath13-band data and derive ages for our sample of groups in the @xmath8 cmd so as to minimise the effects of circumstellar material on the @xmath14 magnitudes for the youngest groups ( especially @xmath9 cha and twa ) .    for assigning distances to each star in our list of members we prefer to adopt trigonometric parallax measurements ,",
    "however when this is not an option ( or where the parallax estimates appear to be in error or have unusually large uncertainties ) we either adopt a kinematic distance from the literature or derive one using the ` moving cluster ' method ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "briefly , we used binary systems with well - constrained dynamical masses to demonstrate that the model predictions for the @xmath14-band are essentially correct .",
    "this then allows us to use the @xmath14-band magnitude along our fiducial locus as a @xmath3 indicator , but also ensures that our semi - empirical model isochrones have a reliable mass scale tied to that of the fiducial cluster . on the assumption",
    "that the @xmath14-band magnitudes predicted by the models are correct , we can then use cmds with the @xmath14-band on both axes ( e.g. @xmath18 ) to calculate any discrepancy between the fiducial locus and the model isochrone , which in this case would correspond to the requisite empirical correction in the @xmath13-band necessary to fit the pleiades at a given age and distance . this empirical correction is then applied to the theoretical bolometric correction grid ( calculated from atmospheric models and a function of @xmath3 and log@xmath19 ) at the appropriate @xmath3 irrespective of its log@xmath19 .",

    "in essence the @xmath20 fitting statistic can be viewed as a generalisation of the @xmath21 statistic to two dimensions on the basis that both the model isochrone and photometric data are two - dimensional distributions ; specifically uncertainties in colour and magnitude for the data and the widening of the model isochrone due to the effects of binarity . as in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the penultimate row lists our final adopted age for each group for which the associated uncertainties represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature.the final row shows literature ldb ages for the bpmg and tuc - hor ( see section  [ discussion ] for references ) which highlights the consistency between the two age diagnostics .",

    "to assess the reliability of our self - consistent , absolute isochronal age scale , we must first compare our derived ages to what are considered well - constrained ages for the same groups .",
    "model - independent methods ( such as kinematic ` traceback ' or ` expansion ' ages ) should offer such a comparison , however studies have demonstrated that the ages inferred from kinematic information alone are simply too unreliable and even unreproducible when similar analyses have been performed using improved astrometric data ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * mamajek & bell 2014 ) ) .",
    "ldb ages have been argued to be both _",

    "the 32 ori group has only recently begun to be investigated ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mamajek 2007 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shvonski et al . 2010 ) ) and hence our isochronal age represents the first definitive age for this group . finally , the reader will note that we do not provide a final adopted age for argus , and there are two primary reasons for this .",
    "first , if argus is indeed @xmath31-old , then the group of 5 a - type stars ( all of which were proposed as members by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman et al . 2011 ) and none of which are unresolved binaries ) should be located on the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the fact that none of these stars are ( 4 are over - luminous and 1 is under - luminous with respect to the zams ) suggests that these stars are not coeval , but instead represent stars at different evolutionary stages .",
    "second , of the k- and m - type stars , less than two thirds have cmd positions commensurate with an age of @xmath31 , whereas the remainder appear significantly fainter and thus older .",
    "we are therefore of the opinion that either our list of members for argus suffers from a high level of contamination or that the association is not physical .",
    "we present a self - consistent , absolute age scale for eight young ( @xmath7 ) , nearby ( @xmath32 ) moving groups in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "further details concerning the methodology presented in this contribution can be found in bell et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , but in brief our analysis involves homogeneously fitting the @xmath8 cmds to derive best - fit ages using semi - empirical pre - ms models isochrones in conjunction with the @xmath20 maximum - likelihood fitting statistic .",
    "our isochronal ages are consistent with currently available ldb ages .",
    "such consistency instills confidence that our new isochronal age scale for young , nearby groups is robust and hence we suggest that these ages be adopted for future studies of these groups . at the moment , we are uncomfortable assigning a final , unambiguous age to argus as it remains unclear whether our membership list for this group constitutes a single population of coeval stars ."
