    "the important behavior of colliding gravitational waves was first shown in khan and penrose s pioneering work [ 1 ] in a plane - symmetric spacetime .",

    "the plane - symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological models were , on the other hand , studied by gowdy [ 4 ] in a vacuum spacetime with compact invariant hypersurfaces , and models containing space - like and time - like singularities alternately were discussed by the present author [ 5 ] .",

    "yurtsever [ 7 ] derived solutions which tend to the kasner solutions asymptotically , contain the cauchy horizons , and are connected with the schwarzschild and weyl vacuum solutions .",
    "the cauchy horizons in the plane - symmetric spacetime were paid attention in similarity to the cauchy horizons appearing in the neighborhood of the time - like singularity of the ressner - nordstrom black hole spacetime . around the latter cauchy horizon",
    "there is the extraordinary behavior of the spacetime such as the mass inflation [ 8 ] and infinite blue shift [ 9 ] .",
    "recently ori discussed the instability of the cauchy horizon in plane - symmetric spacetimes in connection with that in the black hole solutions [ 10 ] , and showed the possibility of a true null singularity in colliding gravitational waves [ 11 ] .    in this paper",
    "we show new exact solutions representing plane - symmetric spacetimes with true null singularities , which are deeply related to ori s local proof [ 11 ] . in  2 , we show the basic equations to be solved , for the plane - symmetric spacetime s in the case of parallel polarization , and derive their new solutions with a kind of self - similarity .",
    "it is found by analyzing one of the curvature invariants that in addition to the space - like or time - like singularity there appear true null singularities for a limited range of the model parameter . in  3 , schemes of colliding waves are shown , corresponding to the above solutions , and in  4 concluding remarks are given . in appendices a and b the tetrad components of curvature tensors and some basic formulas for hypergeometric functions are shown .",
