    "there exist at present many theoretical models that could generalize the standard scenario : composite models , grand unified theories , supersymmetry , technicolor , mirror fermions , superstrings , etc .",
    "all these models show a common feature - they include new particles besides the ones presently known .",
    "the next generation of high energy physics experiments will decide which of these models , if any , corresponds to physical reality .",
    "if we take an optimistic point of view and suppose that at hera and/or @xmath2 energies up to 500 gev some `` new physics '' will be found , then the major question will be the theoretical origin of any new object ( hopefully ) seen by the experimentalists .",
    "since extended models have a large number of undetermined parameters -masses , mixing angles , etc.- this will be a very difficult question to answer . in this paper",
    "we only deal with the lepton sector . in previous publications",
    "@xcite we compared predictions for exotic - lepton production and decays in some of the most popular extended models : vector singlet ( vsm ) @xcite , vector doublet ( vdm)@xcite and fermion mirror - fermion model ( fmfm ) @xcite . in ref.@xcite we explicitly showed that it would be very difficult to establish which of these three models might account for any eventual exotic lepton that materializes in electron - proton collisions at present energies .",
    "here we consider @xmath3 collisions at @xmath4 ( lep ii ) and at a future collider ( nlc ) with @xmath5 .",
    "new heavy lepton pair production has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite and is kinematically bounded by @xmath6 .",
    "all models predict mixing between light and heavy leptons and allow single heavy lepton production @xcite with masses up to @xmath7 .",
    "this was investigated in ref.@xcite for lep i energies , and we extend our previous analysis here for higher energies . in order to reduce the number of theoretical inputs , we have assumed that at these energies new leptons interact only via the ordinary gauge vector bosons @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "other gauge bosons are predicted by many extended models , but the resulting new interactions produce small effects at the current energy scale .",
    "our results are organized as follows : in section ii we review the extended models , their couplings , bounds and decay properties ; in section iii we consider unpolarized electron - positron collisions ; in section iv we consider the production of exotic leptons with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams , and in section v we briefly state our conclusions .",
    "the general charged and neutral interactions of the new leptons @xmath11 mixed with the usual ones and the standard w and z bosons can be written as @xmath12 and @xmath13    the coupling constants in eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) are given in table i of ref.@xcite for each of the three extended models .",
    "upper bounds on the mixing angles were obtained from phenomenological analysis @xcite and lead to @xmath14 .",
    "the large number of mixing parameters imply a large number of couplings in each model . we have taken into account the limiting situation of equal angles which give @xmath15 , v or a couplings . in our estimates",
    "we have taken all mixing angles to have the value @xmath16 .",
    "this value is not a limiting bound and can be easily scaled .",
    "experimental bounds on heavy lepton masses set a lower bound around the z mass @xcite . in the mass region @xmath17 the dominant decay is given by @xmath18 , where b denotes either the w or the z boson and @xmath19 an ordinary lepton .",
    "for the decay @xmath20 and a general vertex of the form @xmath21 the width is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 , whereas the differential decay rate is given by @xmath24- 3(c_v^2-c_a^2){m}_1{m}_l\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\ & \\times { \\delta}^{(4)}({p}_l-{p}_1-{p}_2 ) { { d}^3{p}_1 \\over { 2{e}_1}}{{d}^3{p}_2 \\over { 2{e}_2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the electromagnetic decay @xmath25 is strongly suppressed for the models we are considering here , since they can occur only via one - loop processes . for an exotic charged lepton the dominant decay mode is @xmath26 .",
    "the most favored final state is @xmath27 , with a branching ratio of @xmath28 .",
    "the clean leptonic final states @xmath29 and @xmath30 have a branching ratio of @xmath31 each . for a neutral heavy lepton",
    "the main decay mode is @xmath32 , and the values of the branching ratios for each mode are similar to the corresponding ratios in the case of charged exotic leptons .",
    "a final state with a real z boson is also possible but suppressed relative to the w boson case .",
    "we draw attention to an important point concerning this two - body decay . in the familiar three - body fermion decay ,",
    "the differential decay rates show a linear dependence on the vector and axial couplings @xcite .",
    "this simple fact leads to a different energy spectrum for the final fermions in the v+a , v - a and v , a cases . in the two - body decay",
    "one can see from eq.(4 ) that this is no longer true .",
    "this means that no model dependence can be established from the decay spectrum only .",
    "hence one must look for differences in the basic production mechanism .",
    "the general expression for the angular distribution of single exotic leptons in unpolarized @xmath3 collisions was given in the appendix of ref.@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the total cross section on the mass of the heavy charged lepton is displayed in figs . 1 - 2",
    ", for c.m .",
    "energies @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the analogous curves for neutral lepton production are given in figs .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that at @xmath33 the angular distributions of the primary lepton ( electron or reconstructed neutrino ) could be used to distinguish the three extended model , both in the @xmath34 and @xmath35 production modes . in heavy - lepton production around the z mass ,",
    "the s - channel contributions clearly dominate over those coming from t - channel and interference terms .",
    "the most recent experimental searches , however , place the exotic - lepton mass most likely above the z mass .",
    "the s - channel contributions to the unpolarized angular spectra are suppressed with respect to the t - channel contributions at lep ii , and even more so at nlc energies .",
    "explicit calculations show that at lep ii , and especially at nlc energies , the power of the unpolarized angular distributions of the exotic leptons to differentiate one nonstandard model from another is rather limited , as depicted in figs .",
    "these two graphs correspond to the angular spectra of heavy neutral leptons , but the same pattern is reproduced for exotic charged leptons .",
    "polarized cross sections can often provide important information which otherwise would be concealed in their unpolarized counterparts . in this section",
    "we argue that the angular distributions of single exotic leptons , arising from the collisions of longitudinally polarized @xmath3 beams at lep ii or nlc energies , are quite sensitive to the structure of the specific extended models under study . as discussed earlier ,",
    "this model dependence is negligible in the unpolarized distributions , both at lep ii and nlc energies .",
    "expressions for the definite - helicity angular distributions @xmath36 can be easily derived from the definite - helicity invariant differential cross section @xmath37 given in the appendix , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the helicities of the incoming electrons and positrons respectively , and @xmath40 is the angle of the exotic - lepton three - momentum with respect to the direction of the electron beam .",
    "our numerical calculations of spin - averaged cross sections and angular distributions are consistent with those in refs.@xcite and @xcite . in order to reduce normalization uncertainties , we computed the angular distributions @xmath41 , which are normalized to the corresponding definite - helicity total cross sections .    figs . 7 - 8",
    "show polarized angular distributions concerning the production of charged heavy leptons at lep ii energy @xmath42 and a lepton mass @xmath43 .",
    "fig.7 shows the angular distribution @xmath44 for the fmfm and the vsm .",
    "only the t - channel contribution is nonvanishing , since helicity conservation forbids that the reaction proceed via the s channel if @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the t - channel contribution vanishes in the case of the vdm on account of the v+a character of the nonstandard neutral weak current in this model . when @xmath46 the angular distributions for the vdm and the fmfm look very much like the one shown in fig.7 , but now it is the angular distribution for the vsm that is equal to zero .",
    "this can be understood in terms of helicity conservation and the v - a nature of the nonstandard neutral weak current in the vsm .",
    "fig.8 displays the distinct behaviors of the curves for @xmath47 according to the three extended models . since in this case",
    "the angular distribution for the vdm arises entirely from the s - channel contribution , it will be suppressed at higher energies . considering the reverse helicity combination @xmath48",
    ", we obtain the same pattern of fig.8 , but now the roles of the vdm and vsm are interchanged .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the production rates of charged exotic leptons with polarized beams are not particularly high at lep ii energies .",
    "we estimate rates of the order of 5 events per year at a conservative luminosity of @xmath49 . at a @xmath50 nlc with a yearly luminosity of @xmath51 , on the other hand , the production rates are about @xmath52 events per year .    next we discuss the angular spectra in the production of neutral heavy leptons .",
    "first of all , the t - channel contributions to @xmath44 were found to vanish in all three models . in the vdm",
    "this comes about because the nonstandard charged weak current is v+a if all the mixing angles are taken to have the same value .",
    "this choice of mixing angles and the v - a standard coupling @xmath53 are responsible for the result in the fmfm . on the other hand , for any set of mixing angles , both the standard and nonstandard charged currents are v - a in the vsm , accounting for a vanishing t - channel contribution . fig.9 illustrates the angular distribution in the fmfm and the vsm for the helicity combination @xmath54 .",
    "the spectrum for the vdm is not shown in the picture because the corresponding production rate was found to be much smaller in this model .",
    "the curve for @xmath55 in the vdm and fmfm is similar to the one shown in fig.9 . here",
    "the t - channel contribution in the vsm is also equal to zero .",
    "finally , fig.10 illustrates the angular dependence of @xmath56 in the framework of the three models .",
    "all the distributions arise exclusively from the s - channel process , and are bound to be suppressed at higher energies . to conclude this section ,",
    "it is useful to draw attention to the fact that the production rates of exotic neutral lepton are expected to be comparatively higher in the fmfm and vsm for @xmath54 , as well as in the vdm and fmfm for @xmath46 . taking all mixing angles equal to @xmath57",
    ", we obtain rates of the order of @xmath58 events / year at lep ii and @xmath59 events / year at nlc .",
    "the present and future @xmath2 colliders offer the opportunity to explore new energy scales and search for manifestations of nonstandard physics , which could turn out to be the discovery of exotic leptons . assuming that exotic lepton signatures are observable at lep ii or nlc",
    ", it is appropriate to ask how to decide which extended model correctly accounts for this new physics . at lep",
    "i energies , the angular distribution of single exotic leptons is known to be sensitive to the structure of the three extended models in which we are interested , namely , the vector doublet , vector singlet and the fermion mirror - fermion models .",
    "current experimental results suggest , however , that the heavy - lepton mass is above the z mass . we have shown that , at lep ii and nlc energies , as the s - channel annihilation no longer dominates over the t - channel exchange , the angular distribution of exotic leptons ceases to distinguish the models . for this energy regime",
    ", we have demonstrated the utility of measuring angular distributions of single exotic leptons produced in the collisions of longitudinally polarized @xmath2 beams , with the purpose of testing the various theories which have been proposed to generalize the standard model of electroweak interactions . in order to reduce potential systematic errors ,",
    "it might be more expedient for the experimentalists to measure helicity asymmetries .    _ acknowledgments : _ this work was partly supported by cnpq and finep .",
