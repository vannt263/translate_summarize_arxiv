    "ngc  821 is an isolated elliptical galaxy at a distance of 24.1  mpc ( smith et al . 2004",
    "; see table  [ mainlog ] ) , with very regular optical isophotes of disky shape ( bender et al .",
    "1994 , lauer et al . 2005 ) and an old and metal rich stellar population as typical of elliptical galaxies ( proctor et al .",
    "no cold ( hi ) or dusty ism has been revealed in it ( lauer et al . 2005 , sarzi et al .",
    "ngc  821 is also one of those @xmath7 nearby galactic spheroids for which a central supermassive black hole ( mbh ) has been claimed based on resolved dynamical studies ( ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "the mass of this mbh is @xmath8 ( table  [ mainlog ] ) and its eddington luminosity is @xmath9 .",
    "however , this mbh is extremely quiescent at all wavelengths ( see also pellegrini et al .",
    "2007 ) , and represents an excellent example of the class of `` inactive '' nuclei , that are very common in the local universe ( e.g. , pellegrini 2005a , ho 2005 ) and key to our understanding of the mechanisms of agn evolution and nuclear feedback , that have been fundamental for shaping our universe ( e.g. , springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) . since it is nearby , ngc821 is a prime target for observing a quiescent nucleus and its surroundings .",
    "x - ray emission is a key symptom of nuclear activity resulting from accretion onto a mbh ( rees 1984 ) , and the hot ism that could provide a source of fuel is readily visible in the x - rays ( e.g. , fabian & canizares 1988 ; loewenstein et al . 2001 ; pellegrini 2005a ) .",
    "previous observations of ngc821 with the @xmath10 pspc had placed an upper limit of @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 ( osullivan et al . 2001 ) on the total x - ray luminosity , suggesting a low content of hot gas ( e.g. , kim et al . 1992 ) . with the sub - arcsecond resolution of",
    "@xmath0 we could attempt to resolve the different components of the x - ray emission , i.e. , the hot gas , the nucleus and the population of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter f04 ) .",
    "this previous shallow ( 39  ks ) @xmath0 observation , performed in 2002 , revealed diffuse emission in the central galactic region , possibly from a hot interstellar medium .",
    "we did not detect any source that could be unequivocally identified as the galactic nucleus ( for which we derived @xmath12 ) , but an intriguing s - shaped feature crossing the center of the galaxy was observed .",
    "explanations for this feature included either a weak two - sided x - ray nuclear jet , or a hot gas filament , at a temperature higher than that of the surrounding gas .",
    "this opened the possibilities that the accretion power could end mostly into mechanical rather than radiative power ( di matteo et al .",
    "2003 , pellegrini et al .",
    "2003a , fabbiano et al . 2003 ) , or that the accretion flow may be disrupted by nuclear feedback ( e.g. , ciotti & ostriker 2001 , omma et al . 2004 ; see also soria et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of the analysis of deep @xmath0 observations ( for a total exposure of nearly 230 ks ) aimed at defining the properties of the various sources in the central galactic region . with the deep @xmath0 exposure",
    ", we can constrain all the components ( nucleus , hot gas , unresolved sources ) contributing to the emission , a necessary and critical step when the goal is to understand the accretion process .",
    "for example , we can detect a significant portion of the lmxb population , which was barely visible in the 2002 data , and thanks to the calculation of its x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) we can now discriminate between the contributions to the diffuse emission of the unresolved lmxbs and of the hot ism ( e.g. , kim & fabbiano 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , determining the properties of the hot ism also gives clues on the way the ism evolves in this galaxy , and more in general in galaxies of similar optical luminosity ( e.g. , pellegrini & ciotti 1998 , sansom et al .",

    "2007 ) presents an observational campaign aimed at determining the properties of the nuclear emission of ngc  821 at various wavelengths , including more sensitive proprietary vla and @xmath6 irac observations , together with archival @xmath13 observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ obs ] we describe the @xmath0 observations and data preparation ; in section  [ binpop ] we present the x - ray properties of the whole lmxb population of the galaxy , also making use of @xmath13 wfpc2 images to identify those in field and in globular clusters ; in sections  [ centr ] and [ unres ] we report the results of the x - ray analysis respectively for the nuclear region and the diffuse emission ; in section  [ disc ] we discuss the implications of our observations ; in section  [ concl ] we summarize our results .",

    "the satellite telemetry is processed at the @xmath0 x - ray center ( cxc ) with the standard data processing ( sdp ) pipelines , to correct for the motion of the satellite and to apply instrument calibration .",
    "the data used in this work were reprocessed in custom mode with the version 7.6.0 of the sdp , to take advantage of improvements in processing software and calibration , not available at the time of the original processing .",
    "verification of the data products showed no anomalies .",
    "the relative astrometry of the different observations was corrected by using detected sources ( above a 3@xmath14 threshold ) as reference points ( http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/aspect/align_evt/ ) .",
    "the data products were then analyzed with the cxc ciao v3.0.1 software and the heasarc xspec package .",
    "ciao data model tools were used for data processing , such as screening out bad pixels and producing images in given energy bands .",
    "calibration files in caldb version 3.1.0 of june 2005 were used .",
    "no significant background flares were observed in these data , so no further screening was necessary . a time - dependent gain correction ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2003 ) was applied to the sdp level 2 event files of the first two observations before further analysis .",
    "this correction was already included in the sdp level 2 event files of the other observations supplied by the cxc .",
    "the seven observations were then coadded to produce a deep image , using the ciao task @xmath15 , which takes as input the event files and the relative aspect solution ( asol ) files , and reprojects the coordinates of all the observations onto the first one .",

    "similarly , the background was estimated for each source from an annulus surrounding it , with inner and outer radii of 2 and 5 times the source radius respectively .",
    "when nearby sources are found within the background region , they are excluded before measuring the background counts .",
    "net count rates were then calculated with the effective exposure ( including vignetting ) for both the source and background regions .",
    "errors on counts were derived following gehrels ( 1986 ) .",
    "when the source extraction regions of nearby sources overlap , to avoid an overestimate of their source count rates , we calculated the source counts from a pie - sector , excluding the nearby source region , and then rescaled them based on the area ratio of the chosen pie to the full disk .",
    "once the correction factor is determined , the same factor can be applied to correct counts in all energy bands . for a small number of sources which overlap with nearby sources in a more complex way ( e.g. ,",

    "our procedure for correcting xlfs derived from @xmath0 data was developed and first applied to ngc1316 by kim & fabbiano ( 2003 ; see the appendix therein , where the method is discussed in detail ) , and was then applied to a sample of early - type galaxies by kim & fabbiano ( 2004 ) .",

    ", we simulated @xmath44 point sources , added them one by one to the observed image , and then run @xmath16 to determine whether the added source was detected . with this procedure",
    "we correct simultaneously for incompleteness near the detection threshold , eddington bias ( eddington 1913 ) and source confusion . in the simulations",
    ", we assumed a typical xlf of differential slope of @xmath45 ; however , the adopted slope does not affect the results significantly , and neither does the assumed radial distribution of point sources ( which we assume to follow the optical light , as observed in many elliptical galaxies , see fabbiano 2006 ) .",
    "we excluded central sources with @xmath46 in tab .",
    "[ kim ] , because of the large photometric error caused by confusion with other overlapping sources , and by the possible presence of some diffuse emission ; these conditions make the incompleteness corrections uncertain . with the above procedure",

    "all the different lines of investigation undertaken in this section consistently indicate a largely dominating lmxb contribution to the diffuse x - ray emission",
    ". its spectrum does not require soft thermal emission , that is limited to @xmath132 erg s@xmath2 ( @xmath216% of the total diffuse luminosity ) at 68% confidence .",
    "the observed radial profiles of the stellar light , the resolved point sources and the diffuse emission agree within the errors , suggesting that the diffuse emission has a stellar origin .",
    "the observed radial profile in the soft band is consistent with that expected from the sources ( the lmxb population ) producing the hard emission , except perhaps for the innermost ( @xmath217 ) region .",
    "finally , the luminosity of undetected sources derived from the bias - corrected xlf agrees with the spectral luminosity of the diffuse emission , within the uncertainties .",
    "a fraction of the diffuse emission ( @xmath218% ) can also come from stellar sources other than lmxbs .",
    "in the previous sections we have reported the results of the analysis of a deep @xmath0 pointing ( for a total exposure of nearly 230 ks ) aimed at detecting the nuclear emission and setting stringent constraints on the presence of hot gas both on the circumnuclear and the galactic scale .",
    "the deep @xmath0 image revealed a significant portion of the lmxb population , for which the x - ray luminosity function was derived .",
    "this , together with a spectral and imaging analysis of the diffuse emission , severely constrained the presence of a hot ism ( sect .  [ unres ] ) . at the galactic center , in addition to diffuse emission ( which we can explain as predominantly due to unresolved lmxbs ) , we find four sources of @xmath219 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "we have been able to establish that one of these sources ( s2 ) is coincident with the galactic center .",
    "three of these source , including s2 , are extended , with one of them as long as @xmath120 ( s1 ; fig .",
    "[ s1-s4 ] ) . these sources could be truly extended , or made of one or more point - like components , possibly also embedded in truly diffuse emission .",
    "their spectral shape is consistent with that of lmxbs , but in ngc821 there are only 2 other sources as bright as these , outside the central circle of @xmath38 radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this supports the idea that more than one lmxb is contributing to the emission of each source .",
    "an alternative possibility is that they belong to a continuous complex feature , made of lmxbs ( that may also lie there due to a projection effect ) , a nucleus ( possibly with associated extended emission ) and an outflow / jet .",
    "s1 , in particular , has a linear structure suggestive of a jet ( fig .",
    "[ s1-s4 ] ) .",
    "our vla observations ( sect .  [ intro ] ) help better address these possibilities , and are presented in the companion paper ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2007 ) , together with a discussion on whether / how accretion proceeds in this nucleus , based on all the available observational evidence .",
    "we estimated here a @xmath113 upper limit to the 0.38 kev emission of a point - like source associated with the mbh of @xmath220 , which makes this one of the quietest mbh studied with @xmath0 ( e.g. , pellegrini 2005b ) , with @xmath221 .    in the following we discuss the possibility that there may be undetected hot gas in ngc  821 ( sect .",
    "[ hot ] ) .",
    "hidden hot gas on the nuclear scale could be a source of fuel for the mbh ; furthermore , we check whether the lack of detection on the galactic scale agrees with expectations for the evolution of the ism in this elliptical .",
    "the present analysis does not detect hot gas available for accretion at the nucleus ; coupled with the absence of interstellar medium observed at other wavelenghts ( sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , the lack of fuel for the mbh could be the simplest explanation for the very low levels to which the nuclear emission has been constrained .",
    "however , an aging stellar population continuously returns gas to the ism , via stellar mass losses ( e.g. , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 , david et al .",
    "1991 ) ; as a mimimum , the circumnuclear region should be replenished with this fuel .",
    "below we discuss the possible presence of this ism .",
    "the lack of detection of hot gas on the galactic scale can be expected from simple energetic considerations , comparing the energy made available per unit time by type ia supernova explosions ( @xmath222 ) with the energy required to steadily extract from the galactic potential well the stellar mass losses produced per unit time ( @xmath223 ; ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) , for the whole galaxy lifetime .",
    "@xmath222 comes directly from the observed snia s explosion rate in ellipticals ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ) rescaled for @xmath172 in tab .",
    "[ mainlog ] ; this rate was higher in the past ( e.g. , greggio 2005 ) .",
    "@xmath223 derives from the stellar mass loss rate and the galactic mass profile , that can be well modelled by the superposition of two hernquist ( 1990 ) density profiles ) .",
    "the radial distribution of the dark haloes of ellipticals is not well constrained by the observations .",
    "theoretical arguments favor a peaked profile ( ciotti & pellegrini 1992 ; evans & collett 1997 ) .",
    "high resolution numerical simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) produce a central density distribution equal to that of the hernquist model . ] , one for the stars with total mass @xmath224 , and one for the dark matter with mass @xmath225 .",
    "this model is then tailored onto ngc821 taking the observed @xmath172 , @xmath69 , central stellar velocity dispersion ( tab .",
    "[ mainlog ] ) and @xmath226 ratio .",
    "anisotropic jeans models reproducing the observed velocity dispersion profiles of stars and planetary nebulae out to 5@xmath69 constrain the range of @xmath227 to be 1317 ( romanowsky et al .",

    "2001 , napolitano et al .",
    "2005 ) one derives @xmath229 .",
    "finally , the stellar mass loss rate is distributed as the stars , and derives by summing the mass ejected by each star as a function of its mass ( renzini & ciotti 1993 ) for a kroupa imf , scaled for ngc821 as described in sect .",
    "[ stars ] ; this produces a total mass loss rate of 0.25 @xmath177 yr@xmath2 after 12 gyrs , in good agreement with the values estimated for ellipticals from @xmath230 observations ( athey et al .",
    "the resulting @xmath231 during the galaxy lifetime , with @xmath232 at present ; therefore type - ia sne have always provided the heating to drive the stellar mass losses in a galactic wind ( neglecting the effect of radiative cooling that is not expected to be important for very low gas densities typical of a wind ) .",
    "however , this is a global energetic calculation , and the galaxy may host regions with @xmath233 and regions with @xmath234 . for centrally peaked mass distributions like those described above , numerical simulations of hot gas evolution showed that this is indeed the most frequent case ( pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) : the ism is driven out of the outer galactic regions in a wind , while it is inflowing within a stagnation radius that can be largely different from galaxy to galaxy . to explore",
    "whether this situation applies to ngc  821 , we ran hydrodynamical simulations specific for the galaxy model described above , plus the additional gravitational attraction contributed by its central mbh ( see pellegrini & ciotti 2006 for more details on the numerical code and the time - evolving input quantities ) .",
    "the central grid spacing was set to 5 pc to allow for a better sampling of the inner regions and the gas flow evolution was followed for @xmath235 gyrs , an age comparable with the stellar age of ngc  821 ( proctor et al .",
    "the flow kept in a partial wind all the time , and at the end its total @xmath236few@xmath237 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.38 kev band , well below our observational limit on the hot gas .",
    "the bulk of the hot gas was outflowing , and directed towards the center from within a radius of @xmath238 pc . at the smallest radius at which the flow is well resolved ( 10 pc ) the mass inflow rate",
    "is @xmath239 few@xmath240yr@xmath2 ; the gas density is @xmath241 @xmath242 , one third of the density value calculated from the emission measure of the `` best fit '' thermal component for the central circle , in the deprojected analysis of the diffuse emission ( this component is not statistically required , sect .",
    "[ specdiff ] ) .",
    "note however that the inflowing region is very small and fully included within the extent of the s2 source ( sect .",
    "[ match ] ) . by varying the @xmath226 ratio , the snia s rate , the age of the galaxy and the stellar mass loss rate within the limits imposed by observational uncertainties , the value of @xmath243 keeps within the range @xmath244yr@xmath2 .",
    "the implications for the nuclear emission coming from this estimate of @xmath243 are discussed in pellegrini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    "we just note that @xmath243 ranges from @xmath245 to few@xmath240 yr@xmath2 in the past @xmath246 gyrs , and its integration over this time gives a total mass accreted at the center of @xmath247 , that is @xmath248 of the observed mbh mass ( tab .",
    "[ mainlog ] ) . therefore , accretion of stellar mass losses was not effective in building this mbh mass .    finally , we comment on the fact that , by using @xmath0 observations , the mass accretion rate of galactic nuclei is customarily estimated from the analytic formula of bondi ( 1952 ) , valid for spherically symmetric accretion from a nonrotating polytropic gas with given density and temperature at infinity ( e.g. , loewenstein et al . 2001 , soria et al .",
    "infinity is replaced with an accretion radius @xmath249 ( frank et al .",
    "2002 ) , where the sound speed @xmath250 is calculated as close as possible to the mbh . even in those cases where",
    "@xmath251 can be observed close to the galactic center , so that one can be confident to derive an approximate estimate of @xmath252 , there are additional ingredients that must be considered in the estimate of the mass accretion rate , which were not included in the bondi ( 1952 ) treatment : 1 ) the presence of mass and energy sources ( i.e. , stellar mass losses and snia s heating ) ; 2 ) the presence of cooling ;",
    "3 ) the fact that @xmath252 is not a true `` infinity '' point , since the gas here experiences a pressure gradient . the simulations described here take into account all these aspects , and should give a more reliable mass accretion rate than the bondi theory .",
    "however , they have some limits too . at these very low @xmath243 values , and very small inflowing regions ,",
    "the detailed shape of the galactic mass profile becomes important .",
    "in the case of ngc821 , the observed profile is steeper than modelled here at the very center ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) , which should produce a larger @xmath243 .",
    "the true accretion rate could be somewhat higher than @xmath243 also if even the stellar mass losses within the innermost radius resolved by the simulations are to be accreted .",
    "but further pursuing the flow behavior closer to the mbh with the simulations used here runs into a problem : the discrete nature of the stellar distribution becomes important , since the accretion time ( @xmath253 yrs from 10 pc , in the simulations ) becomes comparable to ( or lower than ) the time required for the stellar mass losses to mix with the bulk flow ( mathews 1990 ) , and the time elapsing between one snia event and the next .",
    "we have observed the nearby , inactive elliptical galaxy ngc821 , known to host a central mbh , with deep @xmath0 pointings , in order to put strong constraints on its nuclear emission and the presence of gas available for accretion .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we detect 41 sources within the optical size ( d25 ) of the galaxy ; excluding 4 particular sources at the center , these represent the lmxb population of ngc  821 .",
    "their x - ray colors , and the spectral analysis of the three brightest ones , are consistent with spectral shapes described by power laws of photon index in the range @xmath31 , without significant intrinsic absorption .",
    "there is no clear evidence for supersoft sources .",
    "2 .   in the overlap region between d25 and the field of view of previously taken @xmath13 wfpc2 images ,",
    "there are six clear associations of lmxbs with globular clusters , plus two additional marginal matches .",
    "these lmxbs reside in the brightest gcs of the galaxy . excluding the two marginal matches , @xmath7% of the x - ray sources lie in gcs , and @xmath40% of the gcs have a lmxb , broadly in agreement with the percentages found for ellipticals in previous works .",
    "the xlf of these sources is well fitted by a simple power law down to @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 ( or to @xmath57 erg s@xmath2 after completeness correction ) , with a slope ( @xmath254 ) similar to that found previously for other ellipticals .",
    "the ratio between the total @xmath63 due to lmxbs and the galactic @xmath172 is lower than the average found for early - type galaxies , but still within the observed scatter .",
    "4 .   at the position of the galactic center a source ( s2 ) is detected for the first time .",
    "its spectral shape is quite hard ( @xmath4 ) , without intrinsic absorption .",
    "s2 is however slightly extended , and a 0.38 kev upper limit of @xmath255 erg s@xmath2 is derived for a point - like nuclear source , one of the smallest established with @xmath0 .",
    "5 .   three other sources , with a spectral shape typical of lmxbs , are detected in the central galactic region ; they are as bright as the brightest sources in the xlf . only one ( s3 )",
    "is consistent with being pointlike ; the other two ( s1 and s4 ) are extended , and could be due to the superposition of few lmxbs and/or truly diffuse emission .",
    "the morphology of s1 resembles a jet - like feature .",
    "diffuse emission is detected out to a radius of @xmath256 .",
    "a few independent lines of investigation , exploiting the spectral and imaging capabilities of @xmath0 , consistently indicate that this diffuse emission is due to unresolved lmxbs , and provide no evidence for hot gas , either close to the center or on a larger scale .",
    "the spectral analysis gives a ( @xmath27 ) limit of l(0.38 kev)@xmath132 erg s@xmath2 on any soft thermal component within a radius of @xmath121 .",
    "other unresolved stellar sources ( mostly m dwarfs and rs cvn systems ) could contribute to the diffuse emission by @xmath257% .",
    "the general scaling of their collective @xmath63 with the galactic @xmath172 was also derived .",
    "numerical simulations of the hot gas evolution for a galaxy model tailored on ngc  821 show that the bulk of the gas is driven out in a wind for the whole galaxy lifetime , due to the heating provided by type ia supernovae .",
    "while this may have been expected based on simple energetic calculations , the simulations also show that the gas is accreting towards the center from within a very small inner region .",
    "this gas flow pattern is expected to be common in low @xmath172 ellipticals , due to their cuspy central mass distribution .",
    "gaseous accretion alone at the rates given by the simulations can not have formed the nuclear mbh of ngc821 .    in a companion paper ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2007 ) , we present further observational results for the central region of ngc  821 , obtained with @xmath6 and the vla , and discuss various possibilities for the nature of the accretion process in this very low luminosity nucleus .    we thank f. ferraro for useful information related to sect .",

    "<S> the relatively nearby ( distance=24.1 mpc ) elliptical galaxy ngc821 , hosting a central massive black hole but inactive at all wavelengths , was observed with @xmath0 for a total exposure of 230 ksec , to search for nuclear emission and gas available for accretion . within its optical image , </S>",
    "<S> 41 sources were detected , with spectral properties typical of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions of lmxbs in the field and in globular clusters were determined , together with their x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) down to l(0.38  kev)=2@xmath1 erg  s@xmath2 . at the galactic center a source of l(0.38  kev)=@xmath3 erg  s@xmath2 was detected for the first time , slightly extended . </S>",
    "<S> its spectral shape is quite hard ( @xmath4 ) , without intrinsic absorption . </S>",
    "<S> it is surrounded by three sources with spectral shape typical of lmxbs and luminosities on the brightest end of the xlf . </S>",
    "<S> one is consistent with being pointlike ; the others could be the superposition of few point sources and/or truly diffuse emission , with one resembling a jet - like feature . </S>",
    "<S> diffuse emission was detected out to @xmath5 , and comes mostly from unresolved lmxbs , with a minor contribution from other types of stellar sources . </S>",
    "<S> different lines of investigation consistently provide no evidence for hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamical simulations show that stellar mass losses are driven out of ngc821 in a wind sustained by type ia supernovae , but also hot accreting gas within a very small inner region . </S>",
