    "zeta functions of various kinds , such as hurwitz zeta function , epstein zeta function and dirichlet @xmath3-function , are all - pervasive objects in modern mathematics , especially in analytical number theory , and among which the prototype zeta function is the famous riemann zeta function .",
    "it is classically defined as the sum of the infinite series@xcite @xmath4 with the complex variable @xmath5 .",
    "specially , the series converges if @xmath6 .",
    "we can extend @xmath7 from @xmath8 with @xmath9 to @xmath8 with @xmath10 by the following formula @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dirichlet eta function or alternating eta function .",
    "historically , people prefer to study the closed form of the riemann zeta function at positive integer arguments in that those special values seem to dictate the properties of the objects they associated . in condensed matter physics for instance ,",
    "the famous sommerfeld expansion , which is usful for the calculation of particle number and internal energy of electrons , involves riemann zeta function at even integers@xcite , while the spin - spin correlation functions of isotropic spin-@xmath13 heisenberg model are expressed by @xmath14 and riemann zeta functions with odd integer arguments@xcite .",
    "it was , without doubt , a profound discovery of euler in 1736 to work out the prolonged basel problem@xcite @xmath15 superbly .",
    "it is well - known that for positive even integer arguments the riemann zeta function can be expressed explicitly as@xcite @xmath16 in terms of the bernoulli numbers @xmath17 . on the contrary , however , the explicit formula for riemann zeta function at odd values is difficult if not fundamentally impossible to obtain .",
    "euler himself once conjectured that @xmath18 and @xmath19 involves the irrational constant @xmath20@xcite .",
    "this suggests that riemann zeta function at odd integers produces a recurrence relation that is self - recursive . even up to now , for positive odd integer arguments the riemann zeta function can only be expressed by series and integral(see and for detail ) .",
    "one possible integral expression is@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 are bernoulli polynomials .",
    "a relevant aspect is that , for riemann zeta function , the celebrated goldbach - euler theorem@xcite assumes the elegant form @xmath23 where @xmath24 $ ] denotes the fractional part of the real number @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath26    indeed , the formulas and , along with do reveal somewhat similarity for the values of riemann zeta function at even and odd arguments .",
    "meanwhile , the calculation of riemann zeta function and related series is a hot topic in computational mathematics .",
    "the traditional methods are euler - maclaurin formula and riemann - siegel formula , and algorithms are still being developed in earnest ever since@xcite .",
    "typically , a particular numerical method is limited to a special domain .",
    "therefore , when concentrating on riemann zeta function at odd integers , a special method should be constructed in view of the connection of riemann zeta function values between odd and even integers .    in this paper",
    "we mainly obtain a recurrence formula relating to the riemann zeta function and based on which we construct an algorithm for the calculation of the riemann zeta function at odd integers . in addition , numerical calculation implies that the algorithm can reach considerable accuracies with small odd integer arguments , not to speak of larger ones .",
    "quantificationally , the behavior of the error bound is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the argument .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of the bernoulli polynomials @xmath27 and their basic properties in a nutshell to render the paper essentially self - contained .",
    "the generating function of the bernoulli polynomials @xmath27 is @xcite @xmath28 taking a derivative with respect to @xmath25 on both sides of , we find that @xmath29 bernoulli polynomials can also be expressed explicitly from bernoulli numbers @xmath30    for convenience , we introduce two kinds of reduced bernoulli numbers(rbns ) , one relates to the even - labeled bernoulli numbers ( denoted by @xmath31 ) @xmath32 and another relates to the odd - labeled bernoulli polynomials ( denoted by @xmath33 ) @xmath34 in this section we will demonstrate the asymptotic representation of the two kinds of rbns in a uniform framework and establish their integral representation subsequently .",
    "the asymptotic expressions of bernoulli polynomials at even and odd subscript are respectively@xcite    [ eq3bsim ] @xmath35 @xmath36    moreover , the bernoulli polynomials can also be expressed in a stronger form based on fourier sine and cosine series expansion@xcite    [ eq3bfourier ]",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38    obviously is just the corollary of . joining together we therefore obtain the asymptotic behavior of rbns    @xmath39    @xmath40    where we use the fact that @xmath41 .",
    "let us consider two auxiliary integrals@xcite    @xmath42    @xmath43    with @xmath44 and @xmath2 are integers and @xmath45 .",
    "specially , when @xmath46 , direct computation shows that    [ eqintsinecosine ] @xmath47 @xmath48    by virtue of and integrating by parts twice , readily yields    [ eqicsrec ] @xmath49 @xmath50    combining and we find that    @xmath51    @xmath52    hold if @xmath44 is even .",
    "immediately , the integral representations of the two rbns @xmath53 and @xmath54 are    @xmath55    @xmath56",
    "mathematically , riemann zeta function is said to be monotonically decreasing since its values are only falling and never rising with increasing values of @xmath8 with @xmath57 . besides , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , thus @xmath60 .",
    "analogously , one can show that @xmath61 . for brevity",
    "we denote the reciprocal function as below @xmath62 now that what we concerned most is the values of the riemann zeta function at integers for the moment , the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of the reciprocal function at odd integers and even integers interests us .",
    "motivated by and , we manage to demonstrate a formula , the so - called _ recurrence formula_(not in a strict sense , though ) , on condition that the argument is a positive integer .",
    "motivated by the recurrence , we manage to construct an algorithm to compute the riemann zeta function .      _",
    "if @xmath2 is a positive integer such that @xmath63 , the recurrence relation holds @xmath64 _    by using of and and the definition of reciprocal function , we have @xmath65 since the limitation of the rightmost term is exactly equal to @xmath13 if @xmath2 is large enough , what we want to prove is @xmath66 or equivalently @xmath67 from the asymptotic formulae and of the two kinds of rbns we find that , without any difficulty , we have finished the demonstration of the recurrence formula of the riemann zeta function .    as a matter of fact , we can extend the validity of from positive integers to positive real numbers straightforward .",
    "we therefore can obtain the asymptotic behavior of riemann zeta function as @xmath68 by using of .",
    "the application of can be diverse , here we just pick a example relating to prime number theorem .",
    "the positive integer @xmath25 is @xmath8-free if and only if in the prime factorization of @xmath25 , no prime number occurs more than @xmath8 - 1 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath69 denotes the number of @xmath8-free integers ( e.g. 2-free integers being square - free integers ) between 1 and @xmath25 , one can show that@xcite @xmath70{x}),\\ ] ] therefore we find that the asymptotic density of @xmath8-free integers @xmath71 is nothing but .",
    "another intriguing issue is to what degree can reveals its ability to obtain the @xmath0-values .",
    "figure [ figerror ] is thus plotted as follow .    )",
    "obtained by , while the stars `` * '' represent the accurate values(@xmath72 ) when @xmath8 is an integer .",
    "the crosses `` @xmath73 '' in the inserted figure , indicate the base 10 logarithm of the absolute errors(@xmath74 ) at integers.,width=302 ]    the fact that all the stars `` * '' lie on the solid curve indicates that may be a suitable candidate for the calculation of riemann zeta function .",
    "the emergence of the abnormal slope between @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the inserted figure , however , implies that any @xmath0-value obtained from its nearest neighbors should be much more accuracy .",
    "we therefore come up with a satisfactory proposal which is postponed until next subsection .",
    "abundant methods to evaluate the @xmath77 have appeared in the mathematical literatures from now and then ever since euler s seminal work . in contract ,",
    "the explicit formula for odd - argument @xmath0-values remains to be an open problem though some results shed light on it@xcite .",
    "by analogy to @xmath77 , several authors have established the series and integral representations of @xmath78 , which , to some degree , provides some perspectives on the difficulty of evaluating @xmath78 as opposed to @xmath77 . from the viewpoint of numerical method ,",
    "one natural way to construct the corresponding algorithm to evaluate the odd - argument riemann zeta function is by viture of the even - argument @xmath0-values near to them . in the current paper , only the two nearest @xmath0-values",
    "are taken into consideration currently for simplicity .",
    "when @xmath2 is large enough , can be rewritten as    @xmath79    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 represent two different representations of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath83 .",
    "judging by appearance , one can use any of the formula above to calculate the riemann zeta function at odd integers .",
    "when considering that those two formulae give the upper and lower bound of the zeta - values at odd integers(see theorem 2 ) , we come up with the idea that we can combine them together by a special method .",
    "it happens to us that there may exist a somewhat mysterious map from @xmath77 and @xmath84 to @xmath78 , which will ensure us to obtain the approximation values of @xmath78 with higher precision .",
    "let us give a proposition relating to dirichlet eta function firstly before we move forward to give another theorem .",
    "[ olss ] _ if @xmath2 is a positive integer such that @xmath63 , the two inequalities hold @xmath85 @xmath86 _    those two inequalities are quite new to the authors because we havent seen them in any literature or monograph before .",
    "however , we are not intended to give the details here since the demonstration is rather elementary .",
    "the theorem below holds once we take advantage of lemma 1 .    _",
    "if @xmath2 is a positive integer such that @xmath63 , the inequality holds @xmath87 _ where @xmath88 and @xmath89 correspond to @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .    since riemann zeta function is a monotonic decreasing function , the exactly value @xmath78 is just between @xmath88 and @xmath89 for any given positive integer @xmath2 .",
    "for the benefit of accuracy we regard the geometric mean values of the and as the approximate values of the reciprocal function @xmath83 , namely @xmath90 which is the most valuable ingredient of our algorithm .",
    "the basic steps for the calculation of @xmath78 are presented as follow .",
    "firstly , @xmath91 and @xmath92 should be calculated from , and ) in sequence .",
    "secondly , the value of @xmath83 is ready to be obtained in light of .",
    "lastly , the ultimate aim , i.e. @xmath78 is just at hand from ) and , reversely . our algorithm does nt bother circulation of any kind , it just looks like a formula , therefore we refer it as the _ direct formula method_.    in order to start our method , we need to know some @xmath0-values at even integers .",
    "for example , @xmath93 and @xmath94 should be available to get @xmath95 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath77 through systematically for small argument .",
    "however , it is almost impossible to obtain bernoulli numbers by the ordinary recursive methods thus we hardly know the values of @xmath77 if the argument is large enough .",
    "many methods for computing bernoulli numbers have been invented .",
    "david harvey introduced an efficient multimodular algorithm@xcite which ensures us to obtain the bernoulli numbers @xmath96 at @xmath97 .",
    "however , one can also use the intrinsic function * zeta*[@xmath8 ] in mathematica since it is also based on an efficient algorithm . therefore , for convenience , our computation platform is mainly on mathematica and we regard those values as benchmarks .",
    "the calculation of riemann zeta function plays an essential role in the study of number theory and associated subjects such as statistical physics and condensed matter physics .",
    "various approaches to accomplish this task have been proposed@xcite , especially for the evaluation of zeta function at integer arguments or in the critical strip ( for the computation of riemann s zeros ) .",
    "most of the methods available consist of using integral forms of some particular functions or recursive series forms . quite recently ,",
    "et al _ transform @xmath7 to some appropriate integral forms and introduce a method to compute the riemann zeta function based on gauss - hermite and gauss - laguerre quadratures@xcite .",
    "numerical result show that 20 points are capable of producing an accuracy of seven - decimal place for small arguments .",
    "besides , many rapidly converging series for @xmath78 have been introduced by srivastava in a review article@xcite and by other authors@xcite . in this section",
    "we firstly give some numerical examples according to our method to illustrate its accuracy , then we compare our method to two selected ones to show that our method is especially powerful to calculate the @xmath0-values at large odd integer arguments .",
    "we regard the @xmath0-values obtained by mathematica as benchmarks .",
    "the result of the riemann zeta function at odd integers with @xmath99 obtained by our method(approximate value ) is presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the accuracy values and the absolute errors are also presented at the same time .",
    ".comparison between accurate values @xmath100 and approximate values @xmath100 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the behaviors of the error bound of integral method and series method , as can be seen from table [ tab3 ] , are totally different . when the argument increases , the errors of the former decrease exponential from a high level , while the latter maintain at a nearly constant low level despite of the variation of @xmath2 .",
    "our method exhibits the worst results for small arguments , but the errors decrease dramatically with argument increasing .",
    "it outstrips integration method and series method before @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "our method superior to them absolutely afterwards . to reach the accuracy obtained by our method",
    ", the number of nodes and terms in the above two methods should be augmented largely . in the series method for instance , the terms of the order @xmath2 in the infinity series",
    "should be included according to and .",
    "obviously , it is almost impossible to carry on within the limited cpu time when @xmath2 is an astronomical number .",
    "in summary we firstly introduce two kinds of reduced bernoulli numbers(rbns ) and prove their asymptotic behaviors in an uniform framework , and their series and integral representations are available at the same time .",
    "what s more , we discover and prove a recurrence formula of the riemann zeta function original and construct an algorithm to evaluate the riemann zeta function at odd integers based on it .",
    "the idea of our method is quiet simple , but it turns out to be a competent algorithm .",
    "the behavior of the error bound @xmath103 is governed by @xmath104 or @xmath105 approximately , which , of course , suggests that our method is especially suit for the calculation of @xmath0-values at large odd integer arguments .",
    "therefore , our results can also work as benchmarks to test the accuracy of other related algorithms .",
    "however , more works should be carried on to improve the accuracy at small arguments in future .",
    "remarkably , the recurrence formula is likely to act as a touchstone to explore the closed form of the riemann zeta function at positive integers since it witnesses the connection between @xmath0-values at odd integers and even integers .",
    "the authors would like to show their appreciation to junesang choi , yong lin and changle liu for some useful discussions , and express their thanks to jinlin liu and jiurong han for their suggestions .",
