    "the kinematics of particle decay leads to sharp edges in certain distributions , whenever the decay proceeds through another intermediate resonance .",
    "well - known examples are the invariant mass of the lepton pair in squark decay @xmath11 through a neutralino and a slepton resonance @xcite , and the hadronic invariant mass distribution in gluino decay @xmath12 through a squark resonance ( see diagrams in figure  [ fig : cascade ] ) .",
    "the latter displays an edge at @xmath13 the sharp feature provides a constraint on the supersymmetric particle masses involved in the decay . in practice , the edge will be smeared out by detector effects , the extent of which depends on the experimental set - up .",
    "however , even on purely theoretical grounds , the sharp edge is expected to be smoothed by radiative corrections and by the width of the intermediate resonance .    in order to predict the spectra locally near the kinematic edge the narrow - width approximation for the intermediate resonance can not be applied .",
    "this is evident from the fact that the leading radiative correction contains a logarithmic singularity @xmath14 in the edge region , the distribution is sensitive to the resonance width @xmath15 even when @xmath16 and contains potentially large logarithms @xmath17 . in the narrow - width approximation @xcite , since the distribution was binned in bin sizes larger than the width . ]",
    "a reliable theoretical framework must account for the presence of the scale @xmath15 .",
    "radiation and interference effects lead to a distortion of the distribution near the kinematic edge .     through an intermediate squark or antisquark resonance .",

    "[ fig : cascade],title=\"fig : \" ]    in this work we quantify this distortion .",
    "we define the edge region and study the factorization property of the hadronic invariant mass distribution at leading order in the expansion in the ratio @xmath18 . the distribution is then computed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling @xmath1 and leading order ( lo ) in @xmath18 , and at nlo in @xmath18 but lo in @xmath1 .",
    "the resummation of logarithms of @xmath18 is left to future work .",
    "our result therefore applies when @xmath18 is small , but not extremely small .",
    "we plan to present further details and results in a longer technical write - up  @xcite .",
    "and the hadronic invariant mass squared @xmath19 .",
    "for the case @xmath20 we show the bulk , edge and tail regions and the lines ( in thick grey ) where the ( anti)squark is on - shell .",
    "the intersection of these lines with the phase - space boundary ( black dots ) defines the edge invariant mass , which is shown also for the case @xmath21 .",
    "the non - horizontal grey line corresponds ( for the case @xmath20 only ) to the resonant value of the second diagram in figure  [ fig : cascade ] .",
    "[ fig : phasespace ] ]    we consider the gluino decay chain @xmath22 through an intermediate squark resonance into a neutralino . at tree level ,",
    "the neutralino is accompanied by a quark - antiquark pair with invariant mass @xmath23 .",
    "the edge value  ( [ edgevalue ] ) is the maximal value the hadronic invariant mass can take for tree kinematics , when the squark momentum @xmath24 is on - shell , @xmath25 .",
    "the tree - level phase space is shown in figure  [ fig : phasespace ] .",
    "the edge value naturally divides the hadronic invariant mass into three regions .",
    "the `` edge region '' is the strip of width @xmath26 , in which the squark propagator can remain resonant , but the distribution is sensitive to the precise virtuality of the propagator .",
    "values @xmath27 up to @xmath28 are accessible only when the squark propagator is off - shell .",
    "we refer to this as the `` tail region '' .",
    "the tree - level distribution falls off rapidly in this region .",
    "finally , the region of hadronic invariant mass below the edge region is called the `` bulk region '' . in this region",
    "the shape of the bulk of the invariant mass distribution is determined by the cascade of two decay processes through an intermediate on - shell squark .",
    "the edge region is the only region that requires a special treatment , because it is intrinsically sensitive to the scale of the resonance width , which enters the resonance propagator . while in the bulk region",
    "the resonance is also on - shell , the propagator can still be expanded in the distribution sense , treating @xmath29 as small . at leading order in @xmath2 ,",
    "this amounts to the narrow - width approximation . in the tail region , on the other hand , the distribution is power - suppressed .    at tree level , invariant masses in the edge region",
    "can be produced in two ways .",
    "for resonant squarks the edge value is attained if the quark and antiquark are back - to - back , since the invariant mass increases with the angle @xmath30 between the quark and antiquark momenta .",
    "alternatively , @xmath31 can also be achieved by @xmath32 or @xmath33 , in which case @xmath34 does not need to be @xmath35 . however , this contribution is power - suppressed due to the off - shell squark propagator . whether @xmath36 must be larger or smaller than @xmath37 depends on whether the neutralino mass is larger or smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "the value of the neutralino mass also determines the resonant decay kinematics in the edge region . for small @xmath39 ,",
    "the neutralino momentum is aligned with the antiquark momentum , otherwise with the quark momentum .",
    "since the gluino and neutralino are majorana fermions , there is another decay chain , @xmath40 , where the quark and antiquark momenta are interchanged and the resonance is an antisquark ( see second diagram in figure  [ fig : cascade ] ) , which interferes with the squark resonance chain . at lo in @xmath2 , however , the two processes can be treated as independent and contribute the same amount .",
    "the reason for this is that the interference of the two amplitudes necessarily requires one of the squark propagators to be off - shell , and hence is @xmath2 suppressed .",
    "we therefore focus on the first decay chain .      when the squark width is set to zero the invariant mass distribution drops to zero discontinuously at the edge value , which is unphysical .",
    "our aim is to describe the shape of this distribution correctly at leading order in @xmath2 , including radiative corrections .",
    "we already noted that the quark and antiquark must be nearly back - to - back at tree level .",
    "it is evident that tree - level kinematics is not changed , if a ) the gluino and squark decay vertices are modified by hard - virtual corrections , b ) the quark and antiquark develop into jets by collinear emissions , and c ) soft gluons connect all strongly interacting particles in the squared amplitude .",
    "we therefore introduce the hard @xmath41 , collinear @xmath42 , anti - collinear @xmath43 and soft @xmath44 regions , where @xmath45 . and @xmath46 for the purpose of power counting .",
    "] here , following soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) notation @xcite , we introduced two light - like vectors , @xmath47 , and decomposed a four - vector into components @xmath48 .",
    "the hard , soft , and jet functions and the interactions of these modes are familiar objects in scet . in addition",
    ", the effective theory after integrating out hard modes includes a resonant mode that describes squarks with off - shellness of order @xmath49 , a situation that is described by unstable - particle effective theory @xcite .",
    "the soft - collinear physics is reminiscent of event shapes in @xmath50 annihilation in the phase - space region of two - jet final states .",
    "however , in the edge region of the cascade decay the two jets do not emanate from a point - like vertex , but from two points , the production and the decay vertices of the long - lived resonance . as a consequence",
    "the soft physics is much more complicated .    ]",
    "we can therefore write down a factorization formula for the hadronic mass distribution of the form @xmath51   + hr\\ , , \\label{eq : factformula}\\ ] ] which is valid in the vicinity of @xmath52 , at leading power in @xmath2 , and graphically presented in figure  [ fig : factformula ] .",
    "the first two factors on the right - hand side of this equation consist of the square of two hard functions , one ( @xmath53 ) containing the hard virtual correction to the on - shell gluino decay @xmath54 , the other ( @xmath55 ) to the on - shell squark decay @xmath56 .",
    "the hard functions multiply the ( anti)quark jet functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 , which contain the collinear ( @xmath57 ) and anti - collinear ( @xmath58 ) modes .",
    "these are convoluted with a soft function that consists of the resonant squark propagators @xmath59 , @xmath60 in unstable - particle effective theory , and a vacuum matrix element @xmath61 of soft wilson lines factored off the jets , the gluino , and the resonances . due to the spatial separation of the two hard decay vertices ,",
    "the soft function is a highly non - local object in position space , which accounts for the distribution of soft momentum between the various factors and for the shape of the resonance",
    ".    the first term in ( [ eq : factformula ] ) would be all there is , if requiring @xmath62 _ always _ forced the hadronic final state to consist of two back - to - back jets .",
    "however , hard ( i.e. non - collinear ) real emission is also possible .",
    "while the interference of hard emission amplitudes _ between _ the two decay stages is power - suppressed , since at least one squark propagator is then thrown off resonance , interference _ within _ the two decay stages separately can leave the squarks on - shell . in terms of feynman",
    "diagrams the hard parton final state can therefore be described as a cluster of partons with invariant mass @xmath63 emerging from the gluino decay vertex and another cluster with mass @xmath64 from the squark decay vertex , replacing the antiquark and quark in the tree diagram , respectively , such that the total invariant mass is near @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are now generically of @xmath65 while only the phase - space region when both are @xmath66 is included in the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : factformula ] ) .",
    "the additional hard - real contribution is denoted by @xmath67 in this equation and must be added by explicit matching . in practice , this amounts to the calculation of hard real radiation to the separate decay stages in dimensional regularization , setting the external squark line on - shell and @xmath19 to @xmath68 .",
    "these simplifications automatically avoid double counting with the first term of ( [ eq : factformula ] ) and correspond to the direct computation of the hard region according to the method - of - regions strategy @xcite .",
    "an intuitive understanding of hard real radiation is obtained from looking at the maximal value of @xmath19 for on - shell squarks in the presence of hard radiation .",
    "if this value is larger than @xmath52 , the previous edge value lies in the bulk region of the hard radiative process . , and from gluino decay for @xmath69 .",
    "] the latter therefore becomes insensitive to the width of the squark and can be treated like the bulk distribution at tree level .",
    "the @xmath67 term is therefore simply a constant contribution to @xmath70 in the edge region .",
    "the structure of ( [ eq : factformula ] ) is similar to resonant and non - resonant production in the factorization formula for the line - shape of a resonance or pair production near threshold in previous applications of unstable - particle effective theory ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "however , here both terms appear at leading power due to the presence of a resonant bulk region at tree - level rather than a single resonant invariant mass or threshold energy .",
    "hence the non - resonant contribution is replaced by the resonant , but width - insensitive and unsuppressed hard - real contribution .",
    "we shall provide a formal discussion of the factorization formula together with technical details in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "at leading order , the factorization formula ( [ eq : factformula ] ) becomes trivial . without any additional gluon ,",
    "there is no hard radiation .",
    "the soft and jet functions are unity . defining the product of spin - averaged / spin - summed tree - level squared matrix elements @xmath71 ,",
    "the hard functions are given by @xmath72 , i.e.  for vanishing off - shellness @xmath73 of the squark .",
    "since the on - shell kinematics is completely fixed at tree level , @xmath72 is constant in phase space .",
    "the resonance factor @xmath59 is the propagator with a constant width @xmath29 , so that @xmath59 and @xmath74 combine to a breit - wigner distribution .",
    "the integration of this distribution with respect to the off - shellness @xmath75 of the squark is the only non - trivial phase - space integral .",
    "the measurement function for the hadronic mass introduces @xmath76-functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , which determine the integration range . depending on the sign of @xmath79 , either @xmath80 or @xmath81 is @xmath82 , and the small off - shellness @xmath75 can be neglected .",
    "hence , the corresponding @xmath76-function is always equal to one and can be omitted .",
    "the integration boundary in the other @xmath76-function can be expanded to leading order in @xmath49 .",

    "the @xmath76-function results in a universal tree - level shape of the edge distribution , since the dependence on the specific decay process appears only in the constant overall factor @xmath72 .",
    "we remark that at leading power in @xmath2 , the @xmath76-function in ( [ eq : loformula ] ) is absent in the bulk region , since the second integration boundary is also @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the differential width is constant in the bulk . in the tail region , on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath76-functions make the differential width vanish .      before turning to the calculation of the radiative corrections ,",
    "we briefly discuss how the next term in the expansion in @xmath2 of the tree - level distribution is computed in the edge region . at @xmath85 , the numerator @xmath87 in ( [ eq : loformula ] )",
    "is not only needed for on - shell decays ( @xmath88 ) but one needs the next order in the taylor - expansion of the off - shell matrix elements with respect to @xmath75 .",

    "we add the nlo qcd corrections at leading power @xmath2 in the edge region ( red solid ) , which is our main result , and the nlo qcd corrections in the narrow - width approximation in the bulk and in the tail region , which diverge at the edge , for comparison ( blue dot - dashed ) .",
    "the edge result gives a valid description where the narrow - width approximation at nlo in @xmath1 clearly fails . at the edge , power corrections @xmath150 are missing . going away from the edge , further power corrections of @xmath151",
    "arise , eventually become dominant , and destroy the validity of the edge description . for large width ( upper plot in figure [ fig : nlo_numerical_result_a ] ) , missing power corrections are sizeable , as can be expected , such that there is no overlap region where the bulk / tail and edge results properly match . for medium width ( middle plots in figure [ fig : nlo_numerical_result_a ] ) , the results for the three regions agree reasonably well if @xmath84 is a few times @xmath152 . this is where the different approximations should be matched , since power corrections in the edge of the form @xmath153 and logarithmically enhanced terms in the bulk / tail ( see ( [ eq : bulktaillogs ] ) ) are both subdominant .",
    "the matching of the bulk / tail and the edge results improves with decreasing width as can be seen by comparing the upper and the lower plots in figure  [ fig : nlo_numerical_result_a ] .",
    "however , for decreasing width , the logarithms of @xmath154 in the edge result increase and resummation of these logarithms becomes mandatory for an extremely small width .",
    "the onset of the unphysical behaviour of the unresummed edge result can be seen close to the edge in the lower plot of figure [ fig : nlo_numerical_result_a ] .",
    "kinematic edges of cascade decays of new particles produced in high - energy collisions may provide important constraints on the particle masses . depending on the experimental resolution an accurate treatment of finite - width and higher - order radiative effects",
    "is required . in this work we performed a next - to - leading order calculation in the two small quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the hadronic invariant mass distribution in the vicinity of the kinematic edge of the gluino cascade decay @xmath12 through a squark resonance , based on a systematic expansion in @xmath2 .    at nlo",
    "it is of course technically possible to perform a standard one - loop computation in the complex mass scheme , as was done for the electromagnetic correction to the decay @xmath155 through a slepton resonance @xcite .",
    "the approach discussed here is nevertheless interesting , since the separation into hard , collinear and soft contributions does not only simplify the calculation , but also elucidates the process - dependent and universal features of distributions in the edge region .",
    "we then find that these are described in terms of on - shell decay matrix elements , universal jet functions and a soft function that depends only on the resonance propagator and soft wilson lines , one for each coloured particle involved .    for very narrow resonances",
    "the perturbative approximation breaks down due to large width logarithms , a situation that becomes relevant only for exquisite experimental resolution .",
    "the factorization structure discussed here makes it clear that these logarithms can be summed with the help of renormalization group equations for the hard and jet functions .",
