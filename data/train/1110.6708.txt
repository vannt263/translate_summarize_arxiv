    "what is the relation between cosmic expansion and local physics ? do local gravitational system , _",
    "i.e. _ , stars , galaxies , galaxy clusters , or even black holes , expand with the cosmic expansion ?",
    "this issue has received much attention over the years @xcite , however , these discussions often produced contradictory results leaving the issue rather ambiguous ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it is generally believed that these contradictions are due to the use of different or unphysical coordinates , or of unphysical solutions @xcite .    in order to address this issue , mcvittie introduced his renowned solution @xcite in 1933 ; this was intended as describing a point mass embedded in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , but modern studies revealed that the mcvittie metric can not describe a point mass @xcite , but is rather interpreted as describing a black hole in a cosmological background @xcite .",
    "einstein and strauss @xcite introduced the swiss - cheese model which is , however , unable to describe the solar system and suffers from other limitations @xcite .",
    "next , the vaidya @xcite , thakurta , sultana - dyer @xcite , and faraoni - jacques @xcite solutions were found , and these solutions also describe black holes embedded in frw universes , each with some restrictions . either the cosmic fluid is restricted to be a cosmological constant ( yielding the schwarzschild - de sitter solution , a very special case , indeed ) , or it must be a mixture of two perfect fluids , one of which is a null dust ( for the sultana - dyer solution ) , or it is an imperfect fluid _ with heat flow _ instead of a simple perfect fluid ( for the faraoni - jacques solution ) @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to look for simpler exact solutions with a single perfect fluid as a source to address the issue of cosmic expansion versus local physics .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to derive such new solutions representing a black hole in a frw universe with a cosmic fluid consisting of dark matter , or of dark matter plus dark energy ( possibly a cosmological constant ) , or of quintom matter @xcite .",
    "these types of solution are also useful , if nothing else as toy models , in the study of dynamical horizons and their thermodynamics @xcite and of primordial black holes @xcite as probes of the early universe @xcite",
    ".    regarding the relation between cosmic expansion and local physics , noerdlinger and petrosian conclude their work @xcite by stating :  _ consider the possible expansion of clusters or superclusters of galaxies , of mean rest - mass density @xmath0 , immersed in a universe containing a gas of particles having energy density @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown that when @xmath2 , the clusters or superclusters expand with the universe , but if @xmath3 , the expansion is reduced in the ratio @xmath4 _ \" .",
    "unfortunately , this conclusion is drawn from the mcvittie solution , which can not describe realistically a point mass , a star , or a cluster of galaxies in a frw background .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by price @xcite who discovered the  all or nothing \" behavior ( _ i.e. _ , weakly coupled systems are comoving while strongly coupled ones resist the cosmic expansion ) .",
    "however , price s result applies only to a de sitter background , not to a general frw universe .",
    "as is well - known , de sitter space is very special : the de sitter metric can be put in static form in the spacetime region between the black hole and the cosmological horizons , which explains why strongly bound systems in this background do not expand @xcite .    in this paper , we present new solutions which we propose to interpret as describing cosmological black holes embedded in frw backgrounds , with the advantage over previous solutions @xcite that they are sourced by a _",
    "single perfect fluid _ , without heat flux .",
    "these solutions lead to surprising results : the black hole ah decreases with the expansion of the universe when the latter is dm- or ( dm+de)-dominated . since the misner - sharp mass is a half of the radius of the ah , also the black hole mass decreases with the cosmic expansion . as the most strongly bound gravitational system",
    ", it is intuitive that the size of a black hole should increase with the expansion of the universe due to the swallowing of surrounding cosmic matter .",
    "however , this picture is incorrect in general as the cosmic expansion `` wins '' over the local gravitational attraction of the black hole .",
    "the universe is always expanding after the big bang and the energy density of the cosmic fluid decreases with cosmic time .",
    "the seemingly bizarre behavior of the misner - sharp mass derives from the fact that it is really a mass sum ( _ i.e. _ , the mass of the background fluid is included ) , and coincides with the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass @xcite .",
    "we note that this is a purely classical effect which makes the black hole mass decrease and has nothing to do with hawking radiation @xcite .    in a quintom - dominated universe , during the matter era the black hole mass decreases , while during the phantom - dominated epoch it increases .",
    "the physical reason is that the cosmic density first decreases and then increases .",
    "since the misner - sharp ( ms ) mass is the sum of the black hole mass and of the background mass , the black hole mass first decreases and then increases .",
    "one interesting result is that the black hole singularity will become naked before the big rip occurs , which violates the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "so if the latter is correct , phantom matter may not exist in nature .    in this paper",
    ", we use units in which the speed of light @xmath5 and newton s constant @xmath6 assume the value unity , and the signature @xmath7 for the metric . the paper is organized as follows : first we show that several known solutions can not describe a black hole embedded in a matter - dominated universe .",
    "second , we present new solutions describing a black hole in a matter - dominated universe , a dark matter plus cosmological constant - dominated universe , and a quintom - dominated universe . the last section contains the conclusions .",
    "a natural starting point to investigate the relation between cosmic expansion and local physics is the 1933 mcvittie solution @xcite , which can be written in isotropic coordinates as @xmath8 ^ 2}{\\left[1+\\frac{m_0}{2a\\left(t\\right)r}\\right]^2}dt^2    + { a\\left(t\\right)^2}\\left[1+\\frac{m_0}{2a\\left(t\\right)r }    \\right]^4    \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\cdot\\left(dr^2+r^2d\\omega^2 \\right)\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath9 reduces to the physical black hole mass when @xmath10const .",
    "( this can be seen by rescaling the radial coordinate @xmath11 ) , and the scale factor @xmath12 is an arbitrary function of the cosmic time @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , the solution reduces to the spatially flat frw metric , and at a first glance , it can be understood as representing a schwarzschild black hole embedded in a spatially flat frw universe @xcite .",
    "however , it is now known that , with the exception of the schwarzschild - de sitter solution , matters are more complicated because the mcvittie metric is singular on the 2-sphere @xmath15 ( which reduces to the schwarzschild horizon if @xmath16const . ) @xcite and this singularity is spacelike @xcite .",
    "it was claimed in the past that the mcvittie metric describes a point mass located at @xmath17 and embedded in a frw universe .",
    "however , this point mass is , in general , surrounded by the singularity at @xmath18 .",
    "this singularity was studied in ref .",
    "nolan @xcite showed that it is a weak singularity in the sense that an object falling onto the @xmath18 surface is not shrunk to zero volume , and therefore the energy density of the surrounding fluid is finite .",
    "however , the pressure diverges at @xmath18 together with the ricci scalar @xmath19 @xcite . while there is little doubt that the mcvittie metric represents some kind of strongly gravitating central object , its physical interpretation is not completely clear and is still a subject of debate @xcite .    in view of this situation",
    "we show that , with the exception of the schwarzschild - de sitter solution , _ the mcvittie solution is unable to describe a black hole or a point mass in a frw universe when the equation of state of the cosmic perfect fluid is @xmath20_. the proof of this statement proceeds as follows .",
    "the mcvittie solution was obtained by forbidding explicitly the accretion of cosmic fluid onto the central object .",
    "this requirement corresponds to @xmath21 , which in turn implies that the stress - energy tensor component @xmath22 and there is no radial flow of energy .",
    "let us assume that the energy - momentum tensor that sources the mcvittie metric is that of a perfect fluid , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the 4-velocity of the comoving observer , and @xmath1 and @xmath25 are the density and pressure of the fluid , respectively .    by substituting the metric and the energy - momentum tensor into the einstein equations @xmath26 ,",
    "the resulting einstein equations can be arranged as @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter and an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath13 .",
    "we recognize eqs .",
    "( [ eq : h - rho ] ) and ( [ eq : ddot - a ] ) as the friedmann and the acceleration equations , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the matter - dominated and the radiation - dominated eras , respectively , while @xmath20 with @xmath32 for a dark energy - dominated universe .",
    "for all these cases , the equation of state assumes the form @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eq : h - rho ] ) tells us that @xmath1 depends only on @xmath13 and , since @xmath20 , the same is true for @xmath25 . in eq .",

    "( [ eq : ddot - a ] ) is satisfied if and only if @xmath37 these admit the unique solution @xmath38 which is the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime .",
    "therefore , _ the mcvittie solution can not describe a black hole embedded in a matter - dominated , radiation - dominated , or dark energy - dominated universe with perfect fluid equation of state @xmath20 . _ in one word , given the equation of state @xmath20 , the mcvittie solution is nothing but the schwarzschild - de sitter solution .    actually , kaloper _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have argued that in the presence of a cosmological constant , mcvittie s solution does in fact represent a black hole in an expanding universe .",
    "here we provide independent support for this statement .    recently , assuming a specific function @xmath39 in the mcvittie solution , lake and abdelqader @xcite performed a detailed study of the particular mcvittie solution and corroborated the conclusion of kaloper _ et al .",
    "_ moreover , using a tetrad - based method for solving einstein s field equations , nandra _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained solutions describing objects embedded in frw universes which provide a new perspective on the mcvittie metric .",
    "the study of the global structure of the mcvittie solution in @xcite revealed unexpected features which make this solution much more complicated than it would seem at a first sight .",
    "something similar probably happens for the new solutions presented here , although we will leave the detailed investigation of radial null geodesics and of the global structure to future work .",
    "because the mcvittie solution can not describe a black hole in a frw universe , we turn our attention to the faraoni - jacques solution @xcite , which is a generalization of the mcvittie solution @xmath40 ^ 2}{\\left[1+\\frac{m\\left(t\\right)}{2a\\left(t\\right)r}\\right]^2}dt^2    + { a\\left(t\\right)^2}\\left[1+\\frac{m\\left(t\\right)}{2a\\left(t\\right)r }    \\right]^4     \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\cdot\\left(dr^2+r^2d\\omega^2 \\right)\\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the function @xmath41 replaces the constant @xmath9 of the mcvittie metric .",

    "now let us examine whether it can describe a black hole embedded in frw universe sourced by a perfect fluid .",

    "in general , they can not describe a black hole embedded in a single perfect fluid - dominated universe_. however , the faraoni - jacques solution can describe a black hole embedded in frw universe provided that the source is given by an imperfect fluid with a heat flux : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the heat flux density .",

    "this result is consistent with our previous discussion in @xcite .",
    "the naked singularity does not arise from regular cauchy data , in fact it was already present before the appearance of the two apparent horizons .",
    "the reason for the increase of the black hole mass in the phantom - dominated epoch can be understood as follows : the density of the universe is increasing , which makes the black hole ah also increase .",
    "hence , the black hole mass ( one half of the ah radius ) increases . on the contrary , in a matter - dominated universe ,",
    "the cosmic density is decreasing , so the black hole ah and the black hole mass decrease . in a cosmological constant - dominated universe ,",
    "the cosmic density is constant and the black hole mass also stays constant .     and @xmath235.,width=245 ]",
    "we have shown that several well - known and less - known solutions of the einstein equations can not describe a black hole embedded in a matter - dominated universe sourced by a single perfect fluid .",
    "this includes the mcvittie , thakurta , sultana - dyer , vaidya , and faraoni - jacques solutions .",
    "motivated by this fact , we have constructed exact solutions of the einstein equations purporting to represent a black hole embedded in a background universe which are as simple as possible , beginning with solutions with a single perfect fluid .",
    "these new solutions generalize the lematre - tolman - bondi metrics ( which are restricted to dust universes ) and do not exhibit accretion of the surrounding cosmic fluid onto the central black hole .",
    "we have found metrics which presumably describe a black hole immersed in a matter - dominated , a matter plus dark energy - dominated universe , and a quintom - dominated universe , respectively .",
    "the ah and the misner - sharp mass are related to the thermodynamics of dynamical black holes and frw universes @xcite , and , therefore , we investigate the evolution of the black hole and cosmic ahs , as well as the misner - sharp mass .",
    "we find that the black hole mass decreases in a matter- or matter plus cosmological constant - dominated universe . in a quintom - dominated universe ,",
    "the black hole mass decreases in the matter era , while it increases in the phantom - dominated epoch .",
    "the physical reason is that the cosmic density first decreases and then increases , which makes the radius of the black hole ah first decreasing and then increasing",
    ". then , also the black hole mass ( one half of the ah radius ) first decreases and then increases .",
    "an interesting result is that the ahs will disappear and the singularity will become naked before the big rip is reached , in violation of the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite . if the latter is correct , then phantom matter may not be allowed to exist in nature .",
    "this statement , however , must be taken with a grain of salt : in fact , it is based on a particular solution of the field equations which may be very special .",
    "while the result is still interesting because very few exact solutions are known to represent the physical situation under study , the solution proposed may still be too special , or fine - tuned , to draw general conclusions . the phenomenology reported here , however , matches that obtained with very different classes of solutions ( which are indeed accreting cosmic fluid ) in @xcite .",
    "another rather surprising result is that the black hole mass decreases in a matter - dominated universe .",
    "as the most strongly bound gravitational system , it seems intuitive that a black hole will have its mass increasing because of the swallowing of surrounding cosmic matter .",
    "our solution represents cases in which there is no accretion onto the central black hole ( as described by @xmath161 ) and in which the cosmic expansion `` wins '' over the local gravitational attraction .",
    "the universe is always expanding and the density of the cosmic fluid always decreases with the cosmic time .",
    "the seemingly bizarre behavior of the ms mass derives from the fact that it is really a mass sum ( _ i.e. _ , the mass of the background fluid is included ) , and it coincides with the hawking - hayward quasi - local mass @xcite . in the absence of accretion of cosmic fluid onto the black hole , this mass sum decreases in any universe in which the cosmological fluid satisfies the weak energy condition and its energy density decreases with the cosmic expansion . in the presence of phantom matter ( such as in the late epoch of a quintom - dominated universe ) , the weak energy condition is violated , the phantom energy becomes more concentrated , instead of being diluted , with the cosmic expansion , and the mass sum increases .",
    "future work will concentrate on studying the generality of the solutions presented here , and of previous solutions interpreted as black holes embedded in a cosmological space . to fully support the interpretation of these solutions as black holes in a cosmological background ,",
    "it is important that a detailed investigation on the global structure of these spacetimes be provided .",
    "until this global analysis is available , we can not yet claim that our solutions do represent black holes embedded in expanding universes , although there is circumstantial evidence .",
    "this analysis will be carried out in future publications .",
