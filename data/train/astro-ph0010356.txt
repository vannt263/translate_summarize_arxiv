    "recent x - ray studies of seyfert 2 galaxies with  and  have shown that the 0.110 kev spectra of these sources are rich in emission lines at both soft and hard energies ( e.g. , guainazzi et al . 1999 ; turner et al .",
    "the interpretation of the emission lines is problematic because of ambiguities about line blending , line profiles , and line flux distribution that are all poorly constrained by  and .",
    "the data are consistent with emission from gas in photoionization equilibrium ( e.g. , netzer , turner , & george 1998 and references therein ) , but there are also attempts to fit the spectra by a two - temperature gas in collisional equilibrium ( ueno et al . 1994 ) , presumably due to starburst emission .",
    "x - ray observations at high resolution both spatially and spectrally are crucial to determining the origin of the x - ray lines in seyfert 2s , a task for which  is uniquely suited .    here",
    "we present a 60 ks  hetgs spectrum of the seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "previous  and  observations of this source revealed several emission lines at both soft and hard energies ( sako et al . 2000a ; guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ; matt et al .",
    "1996 ) . in a companion paper , focusing on the zeroth - order acis image , we established that several components contribute to the x - ray emission from . in particular",
    ", we found that @xmath2 60% of the x - ray flux at 2 kev is due to an extended component on scales @xmath2 2.3 , while at harder energies the contribution from a compact ( 0.8 ) region prevails .",
    "importantly , the acis spectrum of the latter component exhibits several emission lines including a prominent ( ew @xmath2 2.5 kev )  line . in this paper , we concentrate on the analysis of the hetgs spectrum and on the implications for the physical conditions of the emitting gas .",
    "we also use a simultaneous  observation to derive useful constraints on the intrinsic nuclear x - ray continuum . at the distance of the galaxy ( @xmath2 4 mpc ) , 1=19 pc .",
    "was observed with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; canizares et al .",
    "2000 , in prep . ) on 2000 june 6 , with acis - s ( garmire et al . 2000 ) in the focal plane .",
    "the total net exposure was 60,223 s. details on the observation are given in our companion paper .",
    "the hetgs carries two mirror assemblies , the high energy grating ( heg ) and medium energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "the nuclear heg and meg spectra were extracted in a narrow ( 15 pixel ) rectangular region centered on the zeroth - order position , avoiding contamination from the dispersed spectra of the nearby serendipitous sources .",
    "although a few of the serendipitous sources exhibit emission lines in their acis spectra at both soft and hard x - rays , the 0.58 kev flux of the brightest one is a factor 5 weaker than the nucleus .",
    "we thus believe that contamination to the hetgs nuclear spectrum ( in the regions of overlap of the dispersed spectra ) is negligible . the heg and meg spectra were gain corrected and flux calibrated using ancillary response files generated with the ` ciao ` software .",
    "only the first order heg and meg spectra were used for the analysis , as higher orders contain only a few ( 3 per bin ) counts and are not useful .",
    "the spectra were also corrected for cosmological redshift and galactic absorption , @xmath3  ( freeman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "we used a simultaneous 30 ks exposure with  to constrain the higher - energy x - ray continuum emission from .",
    "the  data were reduced following standard criteria ; here we use only data from the pca detector and report only on the results most relevant for the modeling of the  hetgs data , leaving more details to a future paper .",
    "the source    = 10.5 cm    -0.8 cm    was detected with the pca up to @xmath2 30 kev , with a 230 kev count rate of 7.26 @xmath4 0.04 counts s@xmath5 .",
    "we fitted the pca data in the energy range 630 kev , where relatively few lines are present ( mainly  at 6.4 kev , fek@xmath6 at 7.1 kev , and /nik@xmath1 at 7.9 kev ; guainazzi et al .",
    "we find that an excellent description of the pca data ( @xmath7=56 for 62 degrees of freedom ) is obtained with a model including a `` pure '' reflection continuum from neutral gas , plus a heavily absorbed ( @xmath8 ) power law dominant at 10 kev , plus the three gaussians lines .",
    "the best - fit model and fitted parameters are in complete agreement with a previous  observation of  ( matt et al .",
    "1999 , guainazzi et al .",
    "we mainly stress here the results for the intrinsic nuclear continuum : power - law photon index @xmath9 ( 90% confidence errors ) and intrinsic ( absorption - corrected ) 210 kev luminosity in the range @xmath10 , in agreement with the  data ( matt et al .",
    "the first order meg spectra agree well with each other within the resolution of the grating ( @xmath2 0.023  , twice as for the heg ) .",
    "the two heg spectra also agree with each other and with the meg spectra .",
    "therefore , in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , the four spectra were averaged after rebinning the heg data to the meg resolution .",
    "while this procedure sacrifices the higher resolution of the heg , in most cases the lines are unresolved and the loss of resolution is thus well compensated by a cleaner detection of the lines .",
    "figure [ model - data ] shows a wide wavelength coverage view of the flux - calibrated spectrum , binned at 0.02  .",
    "a plethora of emission lines are apparent in the spectrum at all energies .",
    "the most prominent one is the  line at 6.4 kev , with an ew @xmath11 kev , an unresolved core , and a hint of a broader - base component which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "a detailed view of the    = 10.5 cm    -0.8 cm    fe line complex ( figure [ feline ] ) shows also the fe k@xmath6line at @xmath2 7.1 kev , with an intensity of @xmath12 that of the  line .",
    "we have identified another feature at around 6.6 kev , consistent with the k@xmath1 line . as shown below",
    ", our model can not explain the intensity of this feature .",
    "the high absorption column in the direction to , and the relatively faint x - ray flux of the source , do not allow any clear line detections below @xmath13 kev .",
    "table 1 gives quantitative information about the detected emission lines , including the line identification ( note some question marks due to uncertain identifications ) , measured fluxes , and ews .",
    "many h - like and he - like lines of mg , si , s and possibly ar are detected in the spectrum , together with weaker `` neutral '' lines of si , s , ar , and perhaps ca .",
    "the high resolution allows deblending of the forbidden , intercombination , and resonance lines of several of the he - like ions ( figure [ model - data ] ) .",
    "the significance of the lines detections can be judged from the corresponding uncertainties on the line fluxes .",
    "the poor signal - to - noise ratio did not allow a meaningful line - width determination , and all fwhms are consistent with the instrumental resolution .",
    "the ews are calculated with respect to the total observed continuum , which was evaluated using two independent methods .",
    "first , we selected line - free regions of the spectrum ( mostly above 23 kev ) , rebinned the data heavily , and fitted them with a smooth curve .",
    "second , we used the zeroth - order spectrum from an extraction radius consistent with the extraction width of the hetgs spectrum ( @xmath2 3 ) .",
    "the latter was fitted with a power law plus free @xmath14 , plus narrow ( width=0.05 kev ) gaussians representing all the emission lines detected in the hetgs spectrum .",
    "both methods gave consistent results .",
    "the 3 - 7 kev continuum can be described by an inverted power law with photon index @xmath15 and flux f@xmath16 .",
    "this continuum was used in the ew measurements .",
    "the uncertainty on the continuum flux is 22% or better at all wavelengths .",
    "we modeled the observed spectrum using our new line measurements , as well as the information obtained from the radial flux distribution ( from our companion paper )  and the high en-    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ergy observations from ( matt et al .",
    "1999 ) and .",
    "the modeling is based on the following observations : ( a ) the 210   continuum is flat , in @xmath17 , at long wavelengths ( as expected from an `` ionized mirror '' ) and hardens below about 5  ( as expected from a `` neutral mirror '' ) .",
    "this , plus the detection of low ionization species , suggests two distinct components ; ( b ) the ew of the  line is very large , indicating iron over abundance ( e.g. netzer et al .",
    "1998 ) ; ( c ) the extended spectrum ( outside of the central 0.8 ) is flatter than the central spectrum , suggesting that the more neutral component contributes less at larger radii .",
    "modeling is done using ion00 , the 2000 version of the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1996 ) .",
    "this includes the computation of the steady state ionization and thermal structure of the gas , and the emergent spectrum .",
    "the main ingredients of the model are : ( a ) central power - law continuum with @xmath18 , extending from 0.1100 kev and normalized to produce @xmath19 , in agreement with the  and  observations ; ( b ) two component gas with twice - solar metallicity .",
    "we have experimented with the density and column density of the two and found the following satisfactory combination : 1 . an _",
    "ionized component _ with a radial density distribution of @xmath20 where @xmath21 pc and @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "this distribution is consistent with our measured radial flux distribution assuming most of the 0.83  flux is due to scattered continuum .",
    "2 . a _ neutral component _ with a similar ( yet unconstrained ) radial distribution with the same @xmath24 , but with @xmath25 @xmath23 .",
    "the first component is allowed to extend all the way to 300 pc while the second is limited by its column density , arbitrarily chosen at @xmath26 @xmath27 , and is thus terminated well inside the inner 8 pc .",
    "this component can perhaps be viewed as the wall of the inner torus .",
    "the covering factors of the two components are free parameters of the model ; ( c ) the gas turbulent velocity can range from no turbulence ( pure thermal motion ) up to @xmath28 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the increased line width results in an increased intensity of all resonance lines due to continuum fluorescence ( krolik and kriss 1995 ; netzer 1996 ) .",
    "our best model requires no turbulent motion .",
    "several models have been computed , with various covering factors .",
    "a satisfactory solution is found for @xmath29 = 0.40.5 , and @xmath30 ( ionized ) = 0.10.2 , consistent with the expected opening angle of the ( hypothetical ) torus , where @xmath31 is the solid angle subtended by the gas to the illuminating source .",
    "figure [ model - data ] shows the two components alongside with the observations and figure [ ratio ] shows observed over computed intensities for the strongest lines .",
    "note that , given the gas density and location , the only free parameters are the covering factors of the two components .",
    "the overall agreement between the model and the observations is good , given the uncertainties .",
    "in particular : ( a ) the observed fluxes of most emission lines are reproduced , to within a factor of two .",
    "the 1.511  continuum shape is reproduced too .",
    "these  results  support the  idea of the  two component  model ,    = 10.5 cm    with the assumed levels of ionization and metallicity ; ( b ) the covering fractions are consistent with the suggested source geometry .",
    "the radial density distribution reproduces well the highly peaked emission of this source and the relative weak flux outside the central 16 pc . the calculated scattered continuum and extended emission lines in the inner 1657 pc are in good agreement with the ( highly uncertain ,",
    "see our companion paper ) observations and there is no need to assume an additional starburst source ; ( c ) the `` neutral '' iron k@xmath1 and k@xmath6 lines are consistent with the compact , neutral component gas and the assumed metallicity .",
    "notable difficulties are the over - prediction of the fe l - shell lines around 912   and the under - prediction of the 6.6 kev feature if due to .",
    "all argon lines are also under - predicted by the model",
    ". the measured intensity of these lines are highly uncertain and any suggestion for their origin ( e.g. unusual composition ) must await better observations .",
    "we also note that the predicted k@xmath1 flux , outside the central 20 pc , is below the observed value",
    ". this may be due to the already noted uncertainty in flux measurement .",
    "we also note that a `` typical '' nlr , can produce a sizeable fraction of this k@xmath1 emission .    regarding earlier x - ray observations of this source , the discovery paper by matt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reports an  spectrum including both neutral and ionized species .",
    "netzer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) re - analyzed the  data and reported the measurements of six ionized lines plus the iron k - lines , all in reasonable agreement with the present observations .",
    "the paper includes a detailed photoionization model of the source and addresses also the k@xmath1/h@xmath6 line ratio .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported on  data that include the measurement of , , and lines , as well as neutral fe - k lines .",
    "the observed fluxes are in good agreement except for whose  intensity exceeds our estimate by a factor 4 .    the present observations , being far superior in terms of the spatial and spectral resolution , yet limited in signal - to - noise ratio , confirm several of the suspected features of this source , such as the gas location , metallicity , and the various components .",
    "this , and the recently published  observations of mkn  3 ( sako et al .",
    "2000b ) show , for the first time , that centrally illuminated ionized gas in seyfert 2 galaxies can have very different distributions in different sources .",
    "while in mkn  3 most of the line emission is spread over several hundred parsecs , this in not the case in , where the ionized gas is highly concentrated near the center and most of its flux originates within the central @xmath32 pc .",
    "moreover , the new observations show that the more neutral gas is even more concentrated , and its dimension may be as small as a few parsecs . while we do not want to speculate about the origin of this difference , we note the large difference in luminosity between these two sources .",
    "it is therefore possible that the highly ionized gas in seyfert galaxies has dimensions that are regulated by the central source s x - ray luminosity .",
    "the new  observations of the seyfert 2 galaxy  enable the very first detailed analysis of the physical conditions and the gas distribution in the inner 200 pc of this source .",
    "our observations show the emission to be highly concentrated within the inner 60 pc and suggest that emission within this volume is entirely due to the reprocessing of the obscured central source s radiation .",
    "an even smaller , more neutral component is seen through emission of low ionization iron lines and hard reflected continuum .",
    "this is the first determination of the ionized gas distribution in the inner 100 pc region of a seyfert 2 galaxy ."
