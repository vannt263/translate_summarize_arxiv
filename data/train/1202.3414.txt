    "<S> when the scattering length is proportional to the distance from the center of the system , two particles are shown to be trapped about the center . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , their spectrum exhibits discrete scale invariance , whose scale factor is controlled by the slope of the scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> while this resembles the efimov effect , our system has a number of advantages when realized with ultracold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we also elucidate how the emergent discrete scaling symmetry is violated for more than two bosons , which may shed new light on efimov physics . </S>",
    "<S> our system thus serves as a tunable model system to investigate universal physics involving scale invariance , quantum anomaly , and renormalization group limit cycle , which are important in a broad range of quantum physics . </S>"
