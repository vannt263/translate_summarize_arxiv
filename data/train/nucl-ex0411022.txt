    "bright pulsed spallation neutron sources possess high instantaneous neutron fluxes and also lend themselves to the measurement of neutron energy by time of flight .",
    "new high precision fundamental neutron physics experiments can be designed to take advantage of these features  @xcite .",
    "one such class of measurements consists of searches for parity violation in polarized neutron capture on light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "npdgamma , currently under commissioning at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) , is one such experiment .",
    "it is the first experiment designed for the new pulsed cold neutron beam line , flight path 12 , at lansce .",
    "npdgamma will determine the small weak pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath3 , in the n - n interaction  @xcite .",
    "this coupling constant is directly proportional to the parity - violating up - down asymmetry , @xmath4 , in the angular distribution of 2.2 mev @xmath0-rays with respect to the neutron spin direction in the reaction , @xmath5 the asymmetry has a predicted size of @xmath6  @xcite and the goal of the npdgamma collaboration is to measure it to 10% of this value .",
    "the small size of the asymmetry imposes stringent requirements on the performance of the beam line and apparatus .",
    "it is necessary to achieve high counting statistics while at the same time suppressing any systematic errors below the statistical limit .",
    "the experiment makes use of an intense cold neutron beam at lansce  @xcite .",
    "the beam is pulsed at 20 hz and transversely polarized by transmission through a polarized @xmath7he cell .",
    "a radio frequency spin flipper is used to reverse the neutron spin direction on a pulse - by - pulse basis .",
    "the neutrons are captured in a @xmath8 l liquid para - hydrogen target .",
    "the 2.2 mev @xmath0-rays from the capture reaction are detected by an array of 48 csi(tl ) detectors .",
    "the entire apparatus is located in a homogeneous @xmath9  g magnetic field to maintain the neutron spin downstream of the polarizer and to suppress stern - gerlach steering of the neutrons .",
    "three @xmath7he ion chambers are used to monitor beam intensity , measure beam polarization and transmission and monitor the ortho - para ratio in the liquid hydrogen target .    to measure @xmath4 to an accuracy of @xmath10",
    ", the experiment must detect at least a few @xmath11 @xmath0-rays from  capture with high efficiency .",
    "the average rate of @xmath0-rays deposited in the detectors for any reasonable run - time is therefore high , and the instantaneous rates at a pulsed neutron source are , of course , even higher than for a cw source .",
    "because of these high rates and for a number of other reasons discussed below , the detector array uses accurate current mode @xmath0 detection .",
    "current mode detection is performed by converting the scintillation light from csi(tl ) detectors to current signals using vacuum photo diodes ( vpd ) , and the photocurrents are converted to voltages and amplified by low - noise solid - state electronics .",
    "another stringent constraint for the detector system is the detection and elimination of any instrumental systematic effects inducing _ false _ asymmetries associated with imperfections in the detector or data acquisition ( daq ) system .",
    "these effects must be measured periodically in the course of the experiment .",
    "it is therefore essential to perform these measurements in a short time , compared to the run time of the experiment .",
    "the time required for these measurements is determined by the time required to average the electronic noise . for the current mode detection to be effective",
    "the electrical noise in the detector system must be much smaller than the beam - on shot noise .",
    "a series of measurements have been performed both on individual detectors and their components as well as on the detector array as a whole , in conjunction with the daq .",
    "the results show that the detectors meet all requirements described above .",
    "the remainder of this paper describes the measurements in detail , including the setup , the procedures used and the results found . in particular , we report on :    1 .",

    "several other characteristics of the detector array , such as long term gain fluctuations and counting statistics performance , have to be studied with a strong @xmath0-ray source and are thus best done with capture @xmath0-rays in a cold neutron beam .",
    "these tests have also been conducted and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the detector array consists of 48 csi(tl ) cubes arranged in a cylindrical pattern in 4 rings of 12 detectors each around a cylindrical @xmath8  l liquid hydrogen target ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deta ] ) .",
    "in addition to the conditions set on the detector array by the need to preserve statistical accuracy and suppress systematic effects ( see section  [ scn : syse ] ) , the array was also designed to satisfy criteria of sufficient spatial and angular resolution , high efficiency , and large solid angle coverage .",
    "here we discuss some of the reasoning behind certain design choices and describe the specific properties of our array .    to measure the asymmetry ,",
    "a small ( @xmath6 ) parity - violating component must be detected in the presence of an intense isotropic ( parity - conserving ) @xmath0 signal .",
    "the parity - odd component of the signal is proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angle between the direction of neutron polarization and the momentum vector of the emitted @xmath0-ray .",
    "as long as the change in @xmath12 over a detector element is small , the finite size of the detector elements will not reduce the statistical accuracy of the experiment . from a calculation of the average @xmath12 over the solid angle of a detector , the error in the measured asymmetry due to spatial resolution , for @xmath14 detected @xmath0-rays , is @xmath15 for an infinitely fine grained array and @xmath16 for an array with only two detectors , one covering each hemisphere  @xcite . since the error is a slowly - varying function of the degree of segmentation",
    ", there is no pressing need for the detectors to be finely segmented , and the lateral dimensions can be chosen with regard to other criteria .",
    "l liquid hydrogen target .",
    "there are 48 detectors grouped into four rings of 12 detectors each and arranged in a cylindrical pattern around the hydrogen target . ]    a segmented detector with elements large enough to fully contain the @xmath0 energy reduces the noise per detector from fluctuations in the fraction of @xmath0 energy shared among different detectors and simplifies the identification of the @xmath0 emission angle , which as noted above need not be determined with high precision . @xmath0 cross sections in high z materials reach a minimum around @xmath17 mev energy and the corresponding mean free path ( @xmath18  cm for @xmath1 mev @xmath0-rays in csi ) sets the scale for the dimensions of the detector elements .",
    "the size of the individual detectors is @xmath19 . with these dimensions each crystal absorbs about 84% of the energy for a @xmath1 mev @xmath0-ray incident at the center of the front face .",
    "mcnp  @xcite and egs4  @xcite calculations have shown that about 3% of the energy is backscattered from the front face of the crystal , 11% leaks out through the rear face , and 2% leaves through the 4 remaining sides .",
    "this reduces the cross talk between detector elements to a level that is small enough to allow the measurement of the asymmetry to the proposed accuracy .",
    "the main effect of cross talk is a small loss in angular resolution .",
    "a 20% increase in thickness in the direction of the incident @xmath0-ray increases the amount of energy absorption by only 4% .",
    "the overall size of the array , on the other hand , is constrained by the size of the source ( target ) , which depends on the diameter of the neutron beam @xmath20 and the mean free path of a cold neutron in the liquid hydrogen target ( @xmath21  cm for a 2  mev neutron ) .",
    "the liquid hydrogen target is large enough to stop most of the neutron beam .",
    "monte carlo calculations performed using the double differential scattering cross sections for cold neutron scattering in liquid parahydrogen  @xcite indicate that a @xmath22  cm diameter , @xmath22  cm long target will capture about @xmath23% of the incident neutrons  @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on the neutron energy spectrum emitted by the coupled @xmath24 moderator viewed by the npdgamma beam line  @xcite .",
    "the neutrons that are not captured in the liquid hydrogen are absorbed in a thin ( @xmath25  mm ) plastic material loaded with @xmath26li to prevent activation of the csi by neutron capture .",
    "@xmath0-rays are transmitted through the low z of the plastic and the aluminum target vessel with high efficiency . since neutron absorption in @xmath26li",
    "is dominated by charged particle emission as opposed to @xmath0 emission , background @xmath0-rays which can dilute the signal from n - p capture are suppressed . for design purposes we can therefore choose to concentrate on the signal from n - p capture events rather than background events .",
    "the detector array is arranged in cylindrical rings to surround most of the hydrogen target and allow the neutron beam to enter and exit without activating the csi .",
    "it is important to detect the majority of the photons emitted transverse to the neutron beam , since the neutrons are transversely polarized and @xmath0-rays emitted along the neutron polarization direction contribute most to the parity - odd component of the asymmetry .",
    "photons emitted along the beam direction therefore contribute little to the asymmetry , and the question becomes how many rings need to be included .",
    "monte carlo calculations have shown that the error in the asymmetry as a function of the number of rings along the neutron beam axis reaches @xmath27% of its asymptotic value for 4 rings  @xcite .",
    "together with the individual detector dimensions mentioned above this geometry covers a solid angle of nearly 3@xmath28 .    with the detector size chosen to be large compared to the @xmath0",
    "mean free path , the predicted peak @xmath0 rate into a single detector in the experiment is estimated to be @xmath29  mhz , based on moderator brightness measurements  @xcite and monte carlo calculations . at this rate pulse",
    "counting is impractical for csi given the decay time of the scintillation light pulses ( 1 @xmath30  @xcite ) . for an array composed of csi detectors",
    ", the high photon rates must be handled using current mode @xmath0 detection .",
    "the crystals were manufactured and encased in the housing by bicron .",
    "each detector module consists of two rectangular pieces of optically coupled thallium doped cesium iodide crystals .",
    "the slightly hygroscopic csi(tl ) crystals are wrapped in ptfe teflon , a diffuse reflector , and hermetically sealed in a @xmath31 thick aluminum housing .",
    "the _ optics _ program  @xcite was used to study which reflector and crystal surface treatment to use , in order to obtain the maximum light output and best overall uniformity for the given detector geometry .",
    "we found that diffuse reflection produced the best results .",
    "the crystals are coupled to a @xmath32 diameter k+ glass window at the top of the housing assembly to facilitate the detection of the scintillation light by a vacuum photodiode ( vpd ) during standard operation .",
    "the detectors are individually mounted on the array to minimize potential stress and plastic deformation of the crystals .",
    "csi(tl ) was chosen because of its high density ( @xmath33 ) , large _ z _ , high light yield and its relatively low cost .",
    "for the alkali iodides , thallium activation is required to achieve a high light output . for csi(tl )",
    "the emitted scintillation light has a wavelength centered around @xmath34 which is well matched with the absorption characteristics of the type of vpd used in this experiment .",
    "the light yield of csi(tl ) is 54000 photons per mev at maximum emission and with a scintillation efficiency of 12%  @xcite .",
    "the current collected from the vpd anode is amplified by a low noise solid - state amplifier .",
    "a cylindrical aluminum housing for the vpd and preamplifier is mounted on top of the csi crystal assembly .",
    "the housing is designed to be light - tight , to minimize noise contributions from capacitive coupling between electronic components on the preamplifier board and to shield the assembly from outside fields such as those produced by the radio frequency spin flipper . to avoid ground loops",
    "the detector housing is grounded via the signal cable shield only and the detectors are individually mounted to a stand which allows the electrical isolation between detectors .",
    "each detector comes equipped with two light emitting diodes ( led ) , one in each crystal half .",
    "the leds are used during beam off detector diagnostic tests ( see section  [ scn : fam ] ) .",
    "radiation damage will decrease the self - transparency of the crystals , resulting in a decrease in detected light .",
    "csi(tl ) has been found to be rather radiation hard up to doses of more than @xmath35  gy  @xcite , with the precise threshold for significant radiation damage in the crystal dependent on crystal impurities as well as the radiation damage rate .",
    "this radiation dose is approximately the dose that the detectors will receive over the course of the entire experiment ( a few thousand hours of running ) , and the corresponding damage rate is small compared to those that have caused significant radiation damage in csi(tl ) detectors in the past .      to convert the scintillation light to a current the detectors employ @xmath36  mm s-20 hamamatsu vacuum photodiodes rather than photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) .",
    "the decision to use vpds was based on the fact that photomultipliers are very sensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "a @xmath37  g field leaking into the pmt can change its gain by 100% .",
    "the experiment uses magnetic fields to control the neutron spin direction and any field leaking into the detectors may produce large gain changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity of a vacuum photodiode to magnetic fields is only about @xmath38 in a @xmath9  g dc field or @xmath39 for @xmath9  g ac field ( see section  [ scn : lvt ] )  @xcite .",
    "this particular type of vacuum - photodiode was chosen for the low photocathode sheet resistivity .",
    "the low sheet resistivity of the s-20 photocathode reduces the degree of gain non - linearities across its surface.with an s-20 cathode , the vpd has a quantum efficiency of @xmath40 at the csi maximum emission wavelength .",
    "a bias of @xmath41  volts is applied across the vpd via two @xmath42  v batteries located on top of the vpd and preamplifier housing ( fig .",
    "[ fig : idet ] ) .",
    "this removes the necessity for an external supply to be connected directly to the vpds which could cause ground loops and introduce additional noise in the vpds .",
    "the batteries have a capacity of @xmath43  mah , the average beam - on current drawn from the vpds is about @xmath22  na and the vpds can therefore nominally be run for @xmath44  hours continuously .",
    "so the time before exchange should be limited by the battery s five year shelf life .",
    "photodiodes are known to be extremely linear devices .",
    "bench tests with the photodiodes used in the experiment have shown that their gain is uniform to better than @xmath45  per na of photocathode current up to 500 na .",
    "the typical peak photocathode current per detector for the npdgamma experiment is @xmath46  na , while pulse - to - pulse fluctuations seen by the detectors are typically less than 1% .      v batteries to provide the bias across the vpd and three operational amplifier stages . ]",
    "the vpd current in each detector is converted to a voltage signal by a three stage low - noise current - to - voltage preamplifier  @xcite .",
    "the first stage uses an op amp - based current - to - voltage amplifier with a gain of @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : preamp ] ) .",
    "the second amplifier stage serves as an inverter with a nominal gain of @xmath48 .",
    "the resistors in the second stage are used to adjust relative detector gains ( see section  [ scn : daq ] and  [ scn : crgt ] ) .",
    "the third stage serves as a low impedance line driver .",
    "the detector preamplifier has been designed to operate at noise levels close to the theoretical limits set by johnson noise , so that the time required to measure the asymmetry to the level of @xmath49 is dominated by the collection of counting statistics rather than by the need to average electronic noise  @xcite .",
    "various filter stages and ground isolation between the preamp power and signal circuit have been implemented to satisfy these requirements .      because of the small size of the parity violating signal and the presence of the large isotropic signal , the @xmath0 intensities within each of the 8 near detectors and each of the 4 corner detectors in a given ring are nearly equal .",
    "it is therefore possible to equalize the signals from near and corner detectors by gain adjustments ( discussed below ) and sample only ( 1 ) the average signal in a ring , ( 2 ) the differences in each detector from the average signal in a ring .",
    "this strategy allows one to exploit the increased dynamic range to increase the gain of the system and minimize the effects of noise in the sampling electronics .",
    "here we describe the details of how this idea for sampling the array signals was implemented .",
    "the preamplifier output for each detector is sampled by the npdgamma data acquisition .",
    "the daq incorporates four sum and difference amplifier boards with 12 channels each .",
    "each sum and difference board forms an average voltage over the 12 detectors in a given ring and each individual detector signal has its corresponding ring average subtracted . the process is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdas ] .",
    "here each difference amplifier contributes a gain factor of 10 and each bessel filter ( denoted by f in the schematic ) contributes an additional factor of 3 to the gain .",
    "the 48 resulting difference signals and four average signals are sampled by 16-bit adcs .",
    "the sum and difference signals are sampled at @xmath50  khz and @xmath51  khz respectively .",
    "a _ macro pulse _ of data is collected by sampling for a duration of @xmath52  ms , followed by a @xmath9  ms break , before the next frame of neutrons arrives .",
    "this results in 2000 difference and 2500 sum samples for each macro pulse . in the data stream (",
    "before the raw data are written to file ) every group of 20 difference samples and 25 sum samples is summed to produce a final value for each of 100 , @xmath53  ms wide time bins .",
    "the sampled data are transfered via fiber optic connection to a 3.5 tbyte raid array storage device .",
    "figure  [ fig : dout ] shows the 10 macro pulses of electronic pedestal ( beam off ) output for a typical detector , obtained using the described sampling scheme .    .",
    "the 12 corresponding difference signals are denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "the ring average signal is denoted by @xmath55 . here",
    ", @xmath56 denotes the _ rth _ ring and the _ jth _ sample . ]",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig : sdas ] and the sampling scheme just described , the data actually stored for each time bin are a sum of 20 difference samples for each detector @xmath57 and a sum of 25 average samples for each ring @xmath58 . a ring average sample is given by @xmath59 and a difference sample for a given detector in the ring is given by @xmath60 .",
    "in the analysis , the time bin average of the difference and sum signals are recombined to produce the average detector signal for the time bin at the adc input @xmath61 , in adc counts . here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "ms wide containing one data point .",
    "the @xmath52  ms long sampling period is followed by a @xmath9  ms break in each pulse .",
    "also seen are about 14 outliers , where the larger signals are due to incident cosmic rays depositing up to@xmath64  mev in the crystal . ]",
    "the sum and difference scheme increases the effective dynamic range of the adcs , which are limited to @xmath65  v , therefore allowing for a larger gain to be applied and staying above the bit - noise of the adcs .",
    "the bessel filters provide highly correlated adc samples , filtering out high frequency components in the signal , and the high sampling rate averages out the bit noise in the adcs .",
    "the chosen time bin width removes the correlation between the data points actually used in the calculation of asymmetries ( see section  [ scn : dnp ] ) .      achieving the desired accuracy in measuring the parity violating @xmath0 asymmetry depends on good counting statistics with comparatively small errors from other sources , such as electronic noise and systematic effects . during beam - off measurements , the time required to determine any systematic effect is governed by the noise in the preamplifier and the rest of the daq . since these effects need to be studied periodically during the experiment , it is essential to perform the beam - off measurements quickly compared to the time required to collect counting statistics . to satisfy these requirements",
    ", the detector array must have a high photoelectron yield , a low sensitivity to external radioactivity and electromagnetic effects and very good noise performance .",
    "the photoelectron yield enters into the calculation of the average photo current seen at the detector preamplifier output as well as the shot - noise seen at the vpd cathode .",
    "the time needed to measure an asymmetry to a given accuracy is proportional to the inverse of the average photo - current . in a current mode measurement , if the detector has a high photoelectron yield , counting statistics are manifest in the form of shot noise due to the fluctuations in the number of @xmath0-rays entering the detector .",
    "the corresponding expected rms width is given by  @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the amount of charge created at the photo cathode per detected @xmath0-ray , @xmath68 is the average photo - current per detector and @xmath69 is the frequency bandwidth , set by the filtering in the data acquisition system ( daq ) .    since the experiment intends to determine an asymmetry with a precision of @xmath49 , any systematic effect resulting in a false asymmetry has to be measured to at least this level of accuracy in a short period of time .",
    "the measurement of such a small quantity requires the careful evaluation and analysis of any possible systematic effects . for the detector",
    "array the two most serious potential instrumental systematic effects may be caused by a radio frequency spin flipper ( rfsf )  @xcite , which is used to reverse the spin of the neutrons .",
    "the rfsf is a @xmath22  cm diameter and @xmath22  cm long solenoid enclosed in an aluminum housing .",
    "it operates according to the principles of nmr , using a @xmath22  khz magnetic field with an amplitude of a few g and will be mounted partially inside the detector array .",
    "the neutron spin direction is reversed when the rfsf is on and is unaffected when it is off . to turn the rfsf off ,",
    "the current drawn by the coils is switched to a dummy load consisting of a resistor circuit designed to have the same impedance as the coils .",
    "this keeps the load on the main power circuit constant and minimizes pickup of the spin flipper on - off switching in other circuits .    during normal ( beam - on ) operation ,",
    "when @xmath0-rays from neutron capture create a large signal in the array , any magnetic fields leaking into the vpds can produce a systematic effect through a multiplication of the overall detector gain .",
    "we call such an effect a multiplicative systematic error .",
    "in addition , any electronic pickup could add a false signal on top of the real signal .",
    "we call such an effect an additive systematic error .",
    "if these signals are correlated with the spin state of the neutrons , through the spin flipper , this could lead to false asymmetries .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath0-ray detectors will change slowly due to a number of effects .",
    "the primary technique for reducing false asymmetries generated by these slow changes is fast neutron spin reversal .",
    "this allows asymmetry measurements to be made for opposing detectors for each spin state and very close together in time , before significant drift occurs .",
    "note that the asymmetry is measured continuously since the signals from opposite detectors are measured simultaneously for each spin state . by carefully choosing the sequence of spin reversal , the effects of drifts up to second order",
    "are further reduced ( see section  [ scn : asydef ] ) .",
    "there are important reasons for making the overall efficiency of the elements of the detector array as uniform as possible .",
    "equalizing the overall efficiencies through relative gain matching between detectors prevents saturation of the difference signal channels in the adc ( see section  [ scn : daq ] ) and allows an expansion of the dynamic range as discussed earlier . furthermore , uniform detector efficiencies make the observed parity - odd up - down @xmath0 asymmetry signal less sensitive to potential neutron spin - dependent crosstalk from parity - conserving left - right asymmetries which are known to be present at small levels in the interaction of the neutrons with hydrogen and in the @xmath0 angular distribution  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately it was not practical to obtain all the individual components of the detector with sufficiently uniform properties to ensure this by design .",
    "for these reasons great care has been taken to characterize the relevant properties of all of the individual components for each detector so that they can be individually matched to minimize variations in the overall gain of each detector / vpd / preamp combination .",
    "after hardware matching is optimized , final adjustments can be made in amplifier gains and also in software .",
    "this section describes these measurements .    to establish the properties and performance of the individual detector components , a variety of measurements",
    "were performed prior to their assembly .",
    "the photoelectron yield of the csi scintillators and the efficiency of the vpds were measured independently and the results were used to match them and obtain a reasonably uniform relative gain between all csi - vpd detector modules .",
    "after assembly of the detectors , a current mode measurement was performed to establish the combined detector gain and to refine the gain matching using the resistors in the second preamplifier stage .",
    "the primary photo - peaks of two radioactive sources , @xmath70 and @xmath71 and standard pulse counting methods were applied to determine the number of photoelectrons per mev from the rms width of their respective peaks .",
    "this procedure relies on the assumption that the photo - peak widths ( @xmath72 ) are due primarily to the fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons made at the photocathode and subsequent dynodes of the pmt ( shot noise ) , as well as intrinsic properties of the crystal .",
    "contributions to the peak width due to electronic noise were combined with those due to crystal intrinsic properties into a single width @xmath73 .",

    "the accuracy of the measurement is governed by the rate and quality of sampling of a signal that may be viewed as a continuous string of values of a random variable .",
    "the randomness and the spread ( rms width ) of the samples determine how many samples one must take to achieve a certain level of accuracy in the measurement , while the sampling rate determines how long that will take and whether or not one has in fact measured a representative subset of the signal . as the sampling rate is increased , a larger fraction of the width in the signal is due to the correlation between samples , and the observed error will be larger than expected from @xmath109 counting statistics .",
    "thus , for a given number of samples taken , oversampling leads to loss in statistical information .",
    "undersampling , on the other hand , will lead to information loss in the noise since high frequency fluctuations are aliased into lower frequencies .",

    "[ scn : enp ]    to establish the actual rms width one expects to see in the voltage signal at the output of the preamplifier , one has to understand the origin of all noise contributions , their propagation through the daq and their final processing in the data stream .",

    "<S> the small size of the asymmetry requires a high cold neutron flux , control of systematic errors at the ppb level , and the use of current mode @xmath0-ray detection with vacuum photo diodes and low - noise solid - state preamplifiers . </S>",
    "<S> the average detector photoelectron yield was determined to be 1300 photoelectrons per mev . </S>",
    "<S> the rms width seen in the measurement is therefore dominated by the fluctuations in the number of @xmath0 rays absorbed in the detector ( counting statistics ) rather than the intrinsic detector noise . </S>",
    "<S> the detectors were tested for noise performance , sensitivity to magnetic fields , pedestal stability and cosmic background . </S>",
    "<S> false asymmetries due to gain changes and electronic pickup in the detector system were measured to be consistent with zero to an accuracy of @xmath2 in a few hours . </S>",
