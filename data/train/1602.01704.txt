    "although the electronic structure of graphene has been known for more than half a century , it was the pioneer work of novoselov and geim in 2004 what triggered an impressive scientific and technological activity in this two - dimensional system@xcite .",
    "indeed the exceptional characteristics of graphene were fully revealed only after its systematic isolation , characterization and the first studies of its unusual mechanical , optical and transport properties.@xcite the band structure  @xcite includes two points at the corners k and k@xmath0 of the brillouin zone ( bz ) that engender the peculiar low energy properties of the material .",
    "in fact , the low energy excitations around these points  the dirac points  are described by chiral quasiparticles behaving as massless dirac fermions leading to a number of remarkable phenomena.@xcite    bilayer graphene ( blg ) in the bernal stacking consists of two graphene layers where only one of the two carbon atoms of the unit cell of the top layer lies on top of an atom of the bottom layer .",
    "the bilayer unit cell has four carbon atoms leading to four @xmath1-bands .",
    "two of them touch each other at the dirac points , having a parabolic dispersion relation with opposite curvature around it , which results in a zero band gap semiconductor .",
    "this simple - looking band structure wraps surprising properties that make blg an exciting material from the point of view of exploring new physics and because of its potentials for technological applications .",
    "the unique features emerging from the blg electronic structure are due to different properties of the material . on the one hand an electric field",
    "perpendicular to the layers generates a tunable band gap @xcite , a required effect to engineer carbon - based semiconducting devices . on the other hand , from the topological point of view ,",
    "@xcite the bloch wavefunctions of blg present a rich behavior .",
    "indeed by combining these two properties , the detection of the predicted generation of pure valley currents ,  @xcite or valley - hall effect ,  @xcite has been recently reported  @xcite .",
    "the topological properties are determined by the berry phase resulting from the winding of the phase of the bloch wavefunction along a close path around the dirac point .",
    "@xcite the consequences of a non - trivial berry phase are diverse , in particular the mentioned valley - hall effect results from the berry curvature . in the presence of an external magnetic field , the structure of the landau levels ( lls ) with a two - fold orbital degeneracy of the topologically protected zero energy ( @xmath2 ) levels of each valley is also due to the structure of the berry phase .",
    "trigonal warping effects on blg have also been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "they change the spectrum at low energies qualitatively generating four dirac cones with zero energy around the k and k@xmath0 points of the bz .",
    "this is however a very small correction changing the spectrum in an energy range of a few mev around the dirac points .",
    "it has been shown that distortions of the structure of blg can be used to control and enhance the splitting of the parabolic band - contact point into the four cones that move away from the dirac points @xcite . the way this splitting occurs",
    "is associated to topological invariants that define the lls spectrum in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite unveiling the richness of the electronic properties of blg .",
    "here we present results for blg under high pressure .",
    "we show that pressures in the range of @xmath3 to @xmath4 gpa modify in a substantial way the band structure around the dirac points with the corresponding change of the wavefunctions and its topology .",
    "this is so because pressure changes the interlayer distance increasing the coupling between layers . in the resulting band structure ,",
    "the two parabolic bands evolve to generate four dirac cones .",
    "one of them , with a marked trigonal warping is centered at the k ( k@xmath0 ) point and three elliptic cones move away towards the @xmath5 point",
    ". the new ingredient , which has been overlooked in the past , is the breaking of the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the energy of the trigonal cone apex at k is smaller than the energy of the apex of the three elliptical ones .",
    "this difference can be of the order of @xmath6 ev and the fermi surface of neutral blg under pressure consists of small electron and hole pockets .",
    "in such a case , a large enough electric field opens an indirect gap .",
    "in other words , pressure induces a lifshitz transition changing the nature of the fermi surface that , depending on doping , may include electron and hole pockets , each one having a characteristic topological invariant ( winding number ) .",
    "although the pressure needed to observe these effects is rather high , this is still in the experimentally accessible range as , for small samples , diamond anvil cells can reach pressures@xcite much higher than the ones used in the present work .",
    "we present the band structure and its evolution with pressure as obtained with density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "in particular , we analyze in detail the effect of pressure around the k and k@xmath0 points of the bz and present a tight - binding model that properly describes this effect .",
    "the microscopic parameters are obtained by fitting the dft bands .",
    "we show that while the resulting electronic structure is topologically trivial , in the presence of an electric field the bands acquire a berry curvature that lead to a non trivial pressure dependent valley hall effect .",
    "we also present results for the lls of blg under pressure in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "these effects can be measured , adding to the rich behavior shown in blg without pressure @xcite .",
    "path for two different pressures ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 gpa , thick ligth blue and thin red curves , respectively ) .",
    "there are four bands around the fermi level ( horizontal dashed line ) ; two bands whose separation at k increases with increasing pressure and two that overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsfull ] ) . ]",
    "we will assume the bernal stacking for which the unit cell has four carbon atoms , two in each plane .",
    "one of them is directly on top of an atom in the other plane ( labeled @xmath9 and @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ bernal ] ) while the other two are on top of the hexagonal hole of the other plane ( labeled @xmath11 and @xmath12 in the figure ) .",
    "we use dft to determine the change of the atomic positions and the corresponding band structure with pressure , assuming that the effect of pressure is to reduce the distance between planes . to test the validity of this approximation",
    ", we used a more refined protocol considering that the isotropic pressure exerts equal force on each atom .",
    "this procedure is implemented by fixing the distance between atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 and changing symmetrically the position perpendicular to the layers of atoms @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( those opposed to the hexagon center on the other layer ) until the force on them becomes equal to the force on the fist pair .",
    "this procedure provides the structure corresponding to a uniform stress .",
    "we found that the difference between the results of this more refined procedure and those obtained using the rigid plane configuration was less than @xmath13    at the largest pressure considered , leading to a negligible effect on the band structure . in what follows we present results from both procedures indistinguishably .",
    "the conversion from plane separation to pressure was determined from the forces on the atoms .",
    "the dft calculations were done using a plane wave basis set as implemented in the vasp code @xcite with an energy cutoff of @xmath14 ev .",
    "the core electrons were treated with a frozen projector augmented waves ( paw ) scheme@xcite . the exchange and correlation functional was approximated with a simplified generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as parametrized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite .",
    "spin polarized calculations showed that in the range of experimentally accessible pressures the system is non - magnetic .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was not includes in this first runs .",
    "given that the distance between the planes was a controlled parameter , not derived from total energy minimization , the functional did not include van der waals corrections .",
    "additional calculations were carried out to determine if the bernal stacking is still the most stable blg arrangement under pressure .",
    "we found that the bernal stacking always corresponds to the minimum energy configuration  we will limit to this case from hereon .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that a configuration with a lateral displacement with two top atoms symmetrically placed on top of a hexagon is very close in energy ( @xmath15 mev / atom at @xmath16 gpa ) .",
    "the important changes in the electronic structure of the bilayer under pressure occur in a very small region around the k point , which imposes a challenge to the numerical sampling of the brillouin zone .",
    "a sampling of @xmath17 , that in many cases would be enough to guarantee convergence in terms of bz integration , is not enough to produced a reasonable determination of the fermi level in the bilayer under pressure . to overcome this issue we used a non - uniform sampling with the equivalent of a @xmath18 sampling in the neighborhood of the k point and a @xmath17 grid in the rest of the bz .",

    "[ fig : bandsfull ] .",
    "the trigonal warping was mentioned before in tight binding models of the blg @xcite . however , in all this models the dirac cones along t remain at the same energy as the cone at k. as it is evident from the dft results , with pressure there are extra ingredients that are missing in these tight binding representations .",

    "an important effect is the breaking of the electron - hole symmetry ; and ( iii ) a small charge transfer between the two non - equivalent sites of each plane , an effect that is not relevant when describing the low energy bands in terms of a simple two band model .",
    "the resulting band structure is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep - plane ] where the energy - pressure plane is divided in five regions with different constant energy surfaces .",
    "our estimates of the pressure dependence of the microscopic parameters are in good agreement with the zero pressure extrapolation as obtained in recent experimental works .",
    "the evolution of the band structure with pressure can be measured by means of different experimental techniques .",
    "although the small buckling of the graphene planes with pressure does not produce a significant increase of the spin - orbit coupling , valley hall effect and the structure of the landau levels show important changes unveiling the pressure induced lifshitz transition .",
    "we presented results of the hall conductivity and show that this quantity is very sensitive to the pressure and to the carrier density .",
    "variations in the fermi level change the sign and the magnitude of the valley hall response that is increased by a factor three as the carriers vary their origin from the single dirac cone at @xmath89 to the triple degenerate dirac cones at @xmath158 .",
    "the high sensitivity of this effect with pressure makes this structure a potential source for the design of a device for the detection of small pressure variations on two dimensional surfaces such as screen devices and joints .",
    "the lls evolve from a simple structure at low pressures to a rich spectrum at high pressures .",
    "the most notable effect is the breaking of the electron - hole symmetry and the lack of stability of the zero - ll modes , whereas all modes have a field dependent energy .",

    "<S> is increased , these cones separate in reciprocal space and in energy , breaking the electron - hole symmetry . due to their energy separation , their opposite berry curvature can be observed in valley hall effect experiments and in the structure of the landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> based on the electronic structure obtained by density functional theory , we develop a low energy hamiltonian that describes the effects of pressure on measurable quantities such as the hall conductivity and the landau levels of the system . </S>"
