    "the branch theorem is one of the main results of douday s and hubbard s study of _ nervures_. its importance lies in that it describes the structure of the set of postcritically finite polynomials in @xmath0 and that it is a key step in proving that local connectivity of @xmath0 implies density of hyperbolicity .",
