    "solomon s induction theorem together with the fact that imprimitive relations form an ideal in the burnside ring immediately allows us to deal with a large class of groups : if @xmath0 has a non - quasi - elementary quotient , then @xmath0 has no primitive relations ( corollary [ cor : aladeligne ] and theorem [ thm : notquasiel](3 ) ) .",
    "similarly , using theorem [ thm : tims ] , we get the same conclusion when @xmath0 has non - cyclic quasi - elementary quotients for two distinct primes @xmath45 ( theorem [ thm : notquasiel ] ) , and deduce theorem [ thm : a ] in the non - soluble case .",
    "this strategy was inspired by deligne s work on monomial relations .",
    "the @xmath3-group case and the soluble case are somewhat more involved .",
    "our main tool for showing imprimitivity is the fact that in quasi - elementary groups , a relation @xmath46 with all @xmath47 contained in a proper subgroup of @xmath0 is imprimitive ( proposition [ prop : biggroup ] ) .",
    "this is surprisingly useful .",
    "for instance , together with bouc s ` moving lemma ' ( @xcite lemma 6.15 ) it gives an alternative proof of the tornehave - bouc classification in the @xmath3-group case ( see  [ sec : pgroups ] ) .",
    "the classification of primitive relations in soluble groups that are not quasi - elementary is also not hard ( see  [ sec : solvable ] ) .",
    "the most subtle case is that of quasi - elementary groups (  [ sec : qegen ] ) . recall that a group is one of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 a @xmath3-group and @xmath37 cyclic of order coprime to @xmath3 .",
    "assuming that such a @xmath0 has a primitive relation , we analyse the kernel of the action of @xmath29 on @xmath37 (  [ sec : kernel ] ) and decompose all permutation representations of @xmath0 explicitly into irreducible characters (  [ sec : somerels ] ) . we show that @xmath13 is generated by relations of the form @xmath48 with @xmath49 of maximal size among those subgroups that meet @xmath50 trivially .",
    "this already settles theorem [ thm : b ] below , but the remaining issue of primitivity of these generating relations is quite tricky . to show that @xmath51 as above",
    "is imprimitive , it is not enough to show that it is neither lifted from a quotient ( e.g. @xmath52 do not contain a common normal subgroup of @xmath0 ) nor induced from a subgroup , since @xmath51 could be a sum of relations each of which is either lifted or induced .",
    "it becomes necessary to explicitly split the maximal size subgroups into classes in such a way that any relation involving two subgroups from different classes has to be primitive .",
    "this is the general spirit of sections [ sec : ktriv ] and [ sec : knontriv ] , which complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : a ] .",
    "note that for non - soluble groups in theorem [ thm : a](3a ) , @xmath13 is generated by any relation @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( theorem [ thm : notquasiel ] ) .",
    "an explicit construction of such a relation can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.16(i ) ) .",
    "one of the reasons one is interested in brauer relations comes from number theory .",
    "in fact , the motivation for the langlands - deligne classification of monomial relations in soluble groups @xcite was to build a well - defined theory of @xmath55-factors of galois representations starting with one - dimensional characters ; to do this , one needs to prove that the @xmath55-factors of one - dimensional characters cancel in all monomial relations of local galois groups .",
    "if @xmath56 is a galois extension of number fields , arithmetic invariants of subfields @xmath57 may be viewed , via the galois correspondence @xmath58 , as functions of subgroups of @xmath59 . some functions , such as the discriminant @xmath60 extended to @xmath61 by linearity , factor through the representation ring @xmath62 and so cancel in all brauer relations .",
    "on the other hand , the class number @xmath63 , the regulator @xmath64 or the number of roots of unity @xmath65 are not ` representation - theoretic ' , and do not cancel in general . however , their combination @xmath66 does , as it is the leading term of the dedekind @xmath67-function @xmath68 at @xmath69 , and @xmath67-functions are representation - theoretic by artin formalism for @xmath70-functions .",
    "thus , brauer relations can provide non - trivial relationships between different arithmetic invariants , like the class numbers and the regulators of various intermediate fields .",
    "this point of view proved to be very fruitful to study class numbers and unit groups @xcite , related galois module structures @xcite and mordell - weil groups and other arithmetic invariants of elliptic curves and abelian varieties @xcite . in a slightly different direction ,",
    "a verification of the vanishing in brauer relations of _ conjectural _ special values of @xmath70-functions can be regarded as strong evidence for the corresponding conjectures .",
    "this has been carried out in the case of the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture in @xcite and in the case of the bloch - kato conjecture in @xcite .",
    "one concrete number - theoretic application of brauer relations is the theory of ` regulator constants ' , used in the proof of the selmer parity conjecture for elliptic curves over @xmath71 @xcite , questions related to selmer growth @xcite , and also to analyse unit groups and higher @xmath38-groups of number fields @xcite .",
    "the regulator constant @xmath72 is an invariant attached to a @xmath73$]-module  @xmath41 and a brauer relation @xmath51 in @xmath0 . for applications to elliptic curves",
    "the most important regulator constant is that of the trivial @xmath73$]-module @xmath74 , as it controls the @xmath75-selmer rank of the curve over the ground field .",
    "for @xmath76 it is simply @xmath77 to deduce something about the selmer rank , one relies on brauer relations in which this invariant , or rather its @xmath75-part , is non - trivial . as an application of theorem [ thm : a ] , in  [ s : appl ] we settle a question left unanswered in @xcite , namely which groups have such a brauer relation .",
    "this is done in theorem [ thm : regconsttriv ] and corollary [ cor : regconstsubquo ] ; for an example of number theoretic consequences of this result , see  @xcite .    for such applications",
    "one needs a collection of brauer relations that span @xmath8 and that are ` as simple as possible ' , but whether they are imprimitive is less important .",
    "theorem  [ thm : a ] describes the _ smallest _ list of groups such  that    all brauer relations in all finite groups come from such subquotients .",
    "let us give an alternative version of the classification theorem with a much cleaner set of generating relations , that avoids the fiddly combinatorial conditions of theorem [ thm : a ] ( especially 4a,4b,4c ) .",
    "it is a direct consequence of theorem  [ thm : a ] .",
