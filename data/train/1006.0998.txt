    "although the notion of using magnetic semiconductors in spintronic devices dates back to the 1960 s @xcite , the discovery of high temperature ferromagnetism in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms)@xcite initiated an active search for the optimal compound with a magnetic transition above room temperature . since these materials are good sources of polarized charge carriers , they may form the basis of future spintronic devices,@xcite which utilize the spin of the carriers as well as their charge to simultaneously store and process data .",
    "perhaps one of the most promising dms is gaas doped with manganese due to its rather high ferromagnetic transition temperature ( @xmath4 k for bulk samples and @xmath5 250 k for @xmath6-doped heterostructures@xcite ) and its wide use in today s electronic devices .    in ga@xmath7mn@xmath8as ,",

    "each manganese also introduces a localized spin ( @xmath14=5/2 ) due to its half - filled @xmath15 orbital .",
    "in addition , since the mn@xmath9 ion is negatively charge with respect to the ga@xmath10 ionic background there is an effective attractive interaction between the mn ion and the charge carriers .    in previous studies@xcite",
    "some of us have explored the effect of the strong spin - orbit coupling on the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath2 , the carrier polarization as well as the density of states and spectral functions using the dynamical mean - field approximation ( dmfa ) . in these studies",
    "we used the @xmath16 hamiltonian to model the dispersion of the parent material ( gaas ) .",
    "while @xmath16 is a good approximation around the center of the brillouin zone ( @xmath17 point ) , it is a poor one away from it . in this work",
    "we improve our model by incorporating a more realistic tight binding dispersion for the valence bands as well as an attractive on - site potential between the mn ions and the itinerant holes .",
    "moreover , we study the effect of the spin - orbit interaction of the holes on the magnetic behavior of the dms .",
    "we find that for intermediate values of the exchange coupling both the on - site potential and the spin - orbit enhances the critical temperature , while in the strong coupling regime the spin - orbit interaction significantly suppresses @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the effect of the attractive coulomb potential has been discussed for models with only one valence band , which ignore the spin - orbit interaction,@xcite and multi - band tight - binding models , which include spin - orbit coupling , but with a limited sampling of disorder configurations.@xcite here we include on an equal footing the effect of the attractive coulomb potential using a simple hartree term , the exchange between magnetic ions and itinerant holes , the spin - orbit coupling , and the disorder within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite we investigate the ferromagnetic transition temperature , the average magnetization of the mn ions , the polarization of the holes , and the quasiparticle density of states as function of the coulomb and exchange couplings .",

    "one can anticipate that the formation and splitting of the impurity band happens for smaller values of @xmath84 than in the one - band model .",

    "the appearance of two impurity bands is consistent with the fact that the model includes two bands with @xmath85 .",
    "notice that the second impurity band is more populated with light holes ( @xmath86 ) while the first impurity band , with higher energy , is mostly made of heavy holes ( @xmath87 ) . since we keep the filling of the holes fixed ( @xmath88=@xmath89 ) the chemical potential sits in the middle of the first impurity band , as shown in fig .",

    "note that for @xmath70=0.14 the impurity band is formed at lower couplings .",
    "thus , the spin - orbit interaction enhances the formation of the impurity band .",
    "we can explain this by noting that changing @xmath70 from 1.0 to 0.14 decreases the kinetic energy of the heavy holes ( with @xmath90=3/2 ) becoming more susceptible to align their spin parallel to the local moment promoting the formation of the impurity band .",
