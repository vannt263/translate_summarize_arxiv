    "now just over a half - century old , the 1957 bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity @xcite is rightly regarded as one of the most striking achievements of theoretical many - body physics .",
    "it has been ranked along with the band theory of solids and the landau theory of fermi liquids , both single - particle formalisms .",
    "the central concept of the bcs theory is that of fermion _",
    "pairings_. in the original model of cooper @xcite they were simply two - electron bound states relative to a full fermi sea of the many - electron system . in the bcs theory this original concept",
    "was incorporated into a many - body ground - state variational trial wavefunction in which all electrons share pairing correlations .  the theory , though valid only for weak - coupling , not only provided a microscopic model for superconductivity , but it also made many highly specific and quantitative predictions including explaining the isotope effect , predicting the @xmath0 energy gap @xmath1obeying the universal relation , @xmath2 where the transition temperature @xmath3 is the smallest solution of @xmath4 and in explaining @xmath5-dependences of ultrasonic attenuation and nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rates @xcite .",
    "stronger coupling would not guarantee higher - than - pair clusterings , e.g. , tetramers , etc .",
    ", since these higher - order charge clusters have not been detected at all in magnetic - flux quantization measurements in either conventional superconductors ( specifically tin @xcite and lead @xcite ) nor in so - called high-@xmath3compounds such as ybacuo @xcite : the smallest flux unit observed is @xmath6 rather than the originally expected @xmath7 and it is never _ smaller _ than @xmath6 .    for many decades the bcs theory , including its extensions into the strong - coupling regime , appeared to be capable of explaining all of the then known superconducting elements and compounds .",
    "this situation continued while the highest @xmath3 value for any superconductor ( sc ) was @xmath8 k , until the discovery @xcite in 1986 of the first high-@xmath3 cuprate sc la@xmath9ba@xmath10cuo@xmath11 having a @xmath12 k. the discovery @xcite of superconductivity at 92 k in yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 was followed by a search for materials with even higher @xmath3s and lead , within just seven years to the highest-@xmath3 superconductor known and fully confirmed to date , the hgbacacuo cuprate @xcite with a @xmath16 k under very high pressure ( @xmath17 atm ) .",
    "almost a quarter century after the discovery of high - temperature scs in cuprate materials , it is clear that many important questions still remain to be answered . as well as the still unresolved problem of the pairing dynamical mechanism and many - body excitations in the normal state of the high @xmath3 cuprate materials",
    ", there are now also many other recently discovered materials where it is unlikely that bcs theory is applicable , at least in its original form .",
    "these include oxide materials ( such as the cubic bismuthate ba@xmath18k@xmath10bio@xmath14 ) , borides ( such as mgb@xmath13 ) , borocarbides ( e.g. yni@xmath13b@xmath13c ) , carbon - based materials ( including fullerides ,  nanotubes , intercalated graphite , and organic conductors ) , and new high pressure phases of elements @xcite  ( such as fe , s and ca ) and simple binary and ternary compounds . all of these classes of materials have shown superconductivity above 10 k , including several up to nearly 40 k. superconductivity at up to 84 k has even been reported in a cubic ruthenate @xcite .",
    "the ongoing debate about the pairing dynamical mechanism in cuprate high @xmath3 materials has broadly led to two main schools of thought . on the one hand p.w .",
    "anderson argued from the very beginning @xcite that cuprate materials are in a completely different class from other superconducting materials , and as such they must have a completely new pairing mechanism quite different from the bcs theory .",
    "in addition to his original resonating - valence - bond  ( rvb ) model a large range of theories have focussed on superconductivity driven chiefly by _ repulsive _ interactions dominated by the  on - site coulomb - repulsion hubbard @xmath19 .",
    "these include gauge theories @xcite , spin - fluctuation theories @xcite , and the gossammer superconductivity  picture of laughlin @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath20 symmetry order parameter @xcite is generally consistent with pairing mechanisms deriving from a large positive @xmath19 , and there is some numerical evidence for a @xmath20 symmetry ground state in the two - dimensional square lattice hubbard model @xcite .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the positive @xmath19 hubbard model alone can describe the hugely complex normal and superconducting state phenomenology of the cuprate materials @xcite including the characteristic doping dependences , pseudogaps , marginal fermi liquid normal state , isotope effects , and lattice inhomogeneities such as stripes .    on the other hand , many others have taken the view that it is not a completely new theory that is needed , but rather that the bcs theory should be extended and/or generalized to describe these new materials .",
    "this approach has the advantage of building upon the foundations of bcs , and furthermore does not necessarily imply that cuprate superconductivity is in a completely new class of scs . rather , they may be related to other materials but just in a new parameter regime where the usual approximations of bcs ( even including eliashberg strong - coupling corrections ) may not be adequate .",
    "some of the many theoretical models which have been examined in this context include : boson - fermion models @xcite , bipolarons @xcite , the pre - formed pair  or bcs - bec crossover scenario @xcite , non - adiabatic superconductivity @xcite , and generalized bose - einstein condensation of cooper pairs @xcite .    in this work we study electron pairing in a 1d fermi gas under zero- and finite - range , two - fermion interactions to address some novel and unique properties of cps in 1d as compared with the 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite cases . in section 2",
    "we review the cooper pairing mechanism in a simplified model where two particles near a static fermi level interact at @xmath0 . in section 3",
    "we obtain _ exact _",
    "solutions for different types of separable interactions .",
    "the properties of the bound pairs are discussed in section 4 where we derive the dispersion relation for arbitrary values of the center - of - mass momenta ( cmm ) @xmath21 .",
    "section 5 presents results for pairs of particles interacting in a more general case where a range parameter is introduced .",
    "section 6 discusses our conclusions .",
    "to define the original cooper - pair ( cp ) problem @xcite consider a system of @xmath22 identical fermions in @xmath23-dimensions interacting through an attractive two - body potential to study the effects of pairing at nonzero total or center - of - mass momenta under different types of interaction . at zero temperature ,",
    "we assume that the background @xmath24-particle system is in the ground state of an ideal fermi gas with interactions occurring only in the vicinity of the fermi level .",

    "here we focus on some novel and unique properties of cps in 1d , as compared with the 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite cases .",
    "we start from a nonlocal , separable interaction given by@xmath42with @xmath43 this includes all cases of physical interest such as the cooper @xcite , the bcs @xcite , the zero - range or contact @xcite model interactions , as well as the finite - range model interactions as introduced by nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite  that have been used in the description of superconductors , superfluids , bose - einstein condensates , as well as the bcs - bec crossover @xcite picture . the separable form ( [ sepv ] ) assumes that such an expression is valid in each partial - wave channel and may vary for angular momentum states different from zero in 2d and 3d . in all these cases , ( [ cooper ] ) has an analytical solution given by@xmath44where@xmath45is a constant .",
    "the combination of these two equations provides a consistency condition that is equivalent to an eigenvalue equation for @xmath46 , namely@xmath47defining @xmath48 as the pair energy with respect to twice the fermi energy @xmath49 , the continuous limit for large @xmath22 and large volume is@xmath50where @xmath51 is the volume \" of the @xmath23 dimensional system .",
    "when the interaction occurs only in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath52 , and since the integrand in ( eigen1 ) is peaked at @xmath53 , the integral can be reexpressed in terms of the density of states ( dos ) for one spin at the fermi level , namely@xmath54where @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath57 respectively .    in 1d@xmath58if",
    "@xmath59 is constant around the fermi level the usual cooper binding - energy result can be obtained for any cmm wavenumber @xmath60 .",
