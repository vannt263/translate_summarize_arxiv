    "recently attal et al . introduced a new type of quantum walks , so called open quantum walks @xcite . in an open quantum walk ( oqw ) the quantum walker is exclusively driven by the interaction with an environment . in this approach",
    "the dissipation is the factor which determines the dynamics of the quantum walker , as opposed to unitary quantum walk approaches @xcite , where the dissipative effects need to be minimised or eliminated @xcite .",
    "the formalism of oqws rests upon the implementation of completely positive trace preserving maps ( cptp ) .",
    "oqws show rich dynamical behaviour and can be used to perform efficient dissipative quantum computation and state engineering @xcite .",
    "the properties of the asymptotic probability distribution of the oqws were analysed as well @xcite .",
    "however , so far no microscopic model of system - environment interaction which leads to oqws has bee reported . in this paper",
    "we present a model of an open quantum system whose discrete time reduced dynamics is given by an oqw .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the oqw formalism . in section 3",
    "we present a microscopic model of system environment interaction and derive the corresponding quantum markov equation . in section 4",
    "we construct the explicit form of the oqw based on the generalised quantum master equation derived in section 3 . in section 5",
    "we present a simple example of the derivation and in section 6 we conclude .",
    "oqws are defined as completely positive trace preserving maps .",
    "these cptp - maps correspond to some dissipative processes which are driving the transition between the nodes of the graph .",

    "the space of states corresponding to the dynamics on the graph denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an infinite countable set , the space of states @xmath3 will be any separable hilbert space with an orthonormal basis @xmath4 indexed by @xmath0 .",
    "the internal degrees of freedom of the quantum walker , e.g. , the polarisation , spin or @xmath5-energy levels , will be described by a separable hilbert space @xmath6 attached to each node .",
    "any state of the walker will be described on the direct product of the hilbert spaces @xmath7 .    to describe the dynamics of the internal degree of freedom of the walker for each edge",

    "the bath is modelled as a set of harmonic oscillators , so the hamiltonian @xmath47 of the bath is given by , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are creation and annihilation operators satisfying standard bosonic commutation relations and @xmath51 is the frequency of the corresponding harmonic oscillator .",

    "( [ eq : dm ] ) we drop the lamb - shift type term .",
    "this term describes a shift of energy levels of the system due to the interaction with the environment and does not affect dissipative dynamics .",
    "typically , the value of this lamb - type shifts is few orders of magnitude smaller than the other characteristic parameters of the system hamiltonian and traditionally this term is neglected .",

    "@xmath84 this system of differential equations defines a continuous time version of the open quantum walk .",
    "there are at least two ways of constructing the explicit form of the transition operators @xmath32 .",
    "the first one is to solve the system of matrix differential equations ( [ eq : syst ] ) and discretize the solution .",
    "the second way is in deriving transition operators directly from the system of equations ( [ eq : syst ] ) for a infinitesimal time step @xmath85 . in this paper",
