    "<S> in contrast , much less is known about the nature of water dynamics on rna molecules and its role in modulating their functions . despite a few early studies @xcite the potential similarities and differences in hydration effects between proteins and rna </S>",
    "<S> were first pointed out using a combination of quasi - elastic neutron scattering experiments complemented by preliminary simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these and more recent experimental @xcite and simulation studies on trna @xcite and hairpin ribozyme @xcite have emphasized the role of relaxation of water localized at the surface of rna in inducing the dynamical transition at @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many reasons to undertake a detailed study of the impact of water on the native state fluctuations of rna . </S>",
    "<S> first , in executing many of their functions rna accesses low lying excitations , which often might involve local melting of bases as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in prokaryotes there are temperature sensitive elements in the 5@xmath8 untranslated regions ( utrs ) which form base pair with ribosome recognition sites ( shine - dalgarno sequences ) at low temperatures , thus suppressing translation . </S>",
    "<S> recent nmr experiments @xcite suggest that the melting of these strategically located rna sequences in response to elevation in temperature , needed for initiating translating , involves potential pre - melting of the hydration shell . </S>",
    "<S> second , the versatile functional capacity of rna can be attributed to their ability to access low free energy conformational excitations , as demonstrated by probing site specific motions in two regulatory forms of rnas from hiv-1 @xcite . by undergoing such motions on time scales on the order of a few nanoseconds rna molecules adopt a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations , which poises them to recognize and bind a diverse set of ligands . </S>",
    "<S> the key study on rnas from hiv-1 shows that the ability to access such states on a relatively short time scale shows the ability of rna to adapt to changing environmental stimuli , and is encoded in the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , binding of metabolites to riboswitches to control gene expression is likely linked to local fluctuations in specific regions of co - transcriptionally folded utr regions of mrna . in all these examples hydration of rna is likely to play an important role .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the unique capacity of a single rna to change conformations rapidly ( plasticity of rna ) should lead to complex solvent dynamics of water @xcite and counterions @xcite that strongly interact with rna surface . </S>",
    "<S> rna , which has almost an identical chemical composition with dna except for an additional hydroxyl group in the 2-position of ribose ring , displays far more complex structure and dynamics than dna . unlike double - stranded dna , characterized with a homogeneous repeat of watson - crick base pairs , structures of rna in native state are highly heterogeneous , which could give rise to a great amount of variations in dynamics of water @xcite and ions @xcite depending on the location on rna surface . in order to elucidate this aspect and to establish the  universal \" structural basis of , particularly , the water - induced dynamical transition in rna </S>",
    "<S> , we focus our study on water dynamics near rna using two rna molecules , purine- @xcite and preq@xmath0-riboswitches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the water dynamics at the rna surface is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster than dynamics of monovalent counterions , water dynamics occurs effectively on a static electrostatic environment . due to their small size </S>",
    "<S> both riboswitch aptamers , containing key structural elements ( kissing interactions , non - canonical base pairs , and pseudoknot ) , are ideal systems to simulate and to address general features of temperature dependent changes in rna hydration dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> besides usual secondary structural elements such as stack and loop , the purine riboswitch has a three - way junction motif where three helices intersect ( fig.[fig : nucleic]a , left ) . </S>",
    "<S> binding of a purine metabolite into the junction motif consolidates these three helices into a compact structure . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , preq@xmath0 ligand and ca@xmath9 ions forge the preq@xmath0-riboswitch into a compact conformation that adopt h - type pseudoknot in which the nucleobases , composing the main helix ( p1 ) , stabilize the adenine - rich 3-tail via hoogsteen interaction ( fig.[fig : nucleic]a , right ) @xcite .    in this study , we investigate the water dynamics at various locations in the vicinity of folded rna surface as a function of temperature ( @xmath4 ) in the range of 100 k @xmath10 310 k using atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> to study the relaxation dynamics of water molecules , we computed the number of water hydrogen bonds ( hbs ) made with each part of rna structure , and calculated the correlation function to quantify the kinetics and time constant of relaxation ( @xmath11 ) at each temperature . to establish the universality of @xmath3 , we calculated the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath2 ( see methods ) and showed that rnas also undergo dynamic transition at @xmath12 k. over the broad range of temperature above @xmath13 the relaxation time of water hb , @xmath11 , obeys the arrhenius relation , which allows us to extract the corresponding activation energy and attempt frequency for the hydrated water around rna . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of water fluctuations near the riboswitches is highly heterogeneous , reminiscent of glass - like behavior , and is suggestive of low free energy of excitations around the putative folded state . by comparing these parameters from the arrhenius - fit with those of bulk water , </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are distinct classes of water molecules ( not all waters are the same ! ) near rna surface . </S>",

    "<S> n@xmath2110.0 . these water molecules can be defined as those in the first hydration shell around the aptamers . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in our simulations that the hydration level , @xmath22 , defined as the amount of hydrated water in gram per 1 g of rna , is @xmath23 for the purine riboswitch , and @xmath240.56 for preq@xmath0 riboswitch . </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath25 indicates that preq@xmath0 riboswitch is more compact than purine riboswitch . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values of @xmath22 are similar to the experimentally measured value for hydrated trna ( @xmath26 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , generic aspects of hydration dynamics can be inferred from our simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> to reveal dynamic features of water near the rna surface in further detail , we counted the average number of water hbs formed with the riboswitch aptamers . </S>",
    "<S> although there are many ways of defining hydrogen bonds @xcite , we use a geometric criterion , which is often used to analyze hydrogen bonds in proteins and rna structures . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that a hydrogen - bond is formed when , in addition to the distance criterion ( @xmath27  ) , the angle between the hydrogen donor - acceptor axis and the donor - hydrogen bond ( o - h / </S>",
    "<S> n - h ) is @xmath28 . with this definition , </S>",
    "<S> there are n@xmath29 543 hbs formed between water molecules and the purine - riboswitch during the simulations , which corresponds to n@xmath30 7.7 water hbs per nucleotide . for preq@xmath0-riboswitch , we find n@xmath29 252 and n@xmath29 7.0 . </S>",
    "<S> our previous simulations of trna@xmath31 @xcite , whose size is comparable to _ add_-riboswitch , showed a similar value for the number .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the formation of hb with rna is heterogeneous . in particular , the propensity to make h - bond with water varies depending on the position of a given atom in the nucleotide . in the native state , </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the o1p and o2p atoms of phosphate group ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : nucleic]b ) , which are the most exposed parts of the nucleotide to the solvent , form about @xmath32 hydrogen bonds with water molecules . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) in most of the residues , atoms o3 , o4 , and o5 in the ribose group are less solvent accessible , and form only about 0.5 , 0.5 , and 0.3 hbs , respectively , whereas o2 atoms form @xmath33 hb with water hydrogens ( fig.[fig : nucleic]b ) . ( </S>",
    "<S> iii ) in the base groups , unprotonated nitrogen and oxygen ( n / o ) atoms form about 0.5 - 1 hb with water hydrogens , but the protonated nitrogen and oxygen ( nh / oh ) form @xmath34 hbs with water oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the average number of hbs with water for protonated sites are smaller than unprotonated sites because many protonated sites participate in the formation of base pairs . </S>",
    "<S> + * kinetics of water hydrogen bond near rna surface : * the abundance of water molecules around phosphate group is easily anticipated because phosphate groups are not only negatively charged , but are also the most exposed to the solvent environment in both the native and unfolded states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it may be tempting to conclude that the residence time of water molecules near phosphate groups should be longer than ribose or base groups . </S>",
    "<S> however , our simulations show that water dynamics around rna is considerably more complicated reflecting complex structure of rna . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it turns out that instead of phosphate groups , water exhibits the slowest relaxation dynamics near bases . to elucidate the complex water dynamics near the surface of rna </S>",
    "<S> , we quantify the relaxation dynamics of the number of water hbs as a function of time using the time correlation function ( @xmath35 ) ( see methods ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.[fig : nucleic]c , the relaxation kinetics of water hb at @xmath14 k with different nucleotide groups ( b : base , r : ribose , p : phosphate ) of purine riboswitch aptamer can be described using a multi - exponential function @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38b , r , and p. ( it is possible to fit @xmath35 using stretched exponential function . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that depending on @xmath4 the fit might require more than one stretched exponential function , making the interpretation difficult . ) </S>",
    "<S> the multi - phasic kinetics implies that various types of interactions with distinct time scales govern the dynamics of water molecules with nucleotides . in fig.[fig : nucleic]c , up to the 99.9 % of the decay of @xmath39 can be described with n=4 . among the four phases , the time scales of relaxation and the corresponding weights satisfy an inequality @xmath40 with @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> the correlation function ( or survival probability ) of water h - bonds drops below @xmath47 when time @xmath48 is greater than @xmath49 100 ps . at short times </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath50 ps ) , hydrogen bonding of phosphate groups with water has a longer relaxation time than that of ribose or base with water , but at longer times ( @xmath51 ps ) slow water dynamics is dominated by water molecules trapped near base and ribose although such contribution is made by less than 10 % of the hydrated water population . from @xmath52 , </S>",
    "<S> the average lifetime of water h - bond at each group is calculated as @xmath53 ps , @xmath54 ps , and @xmath55 ps . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth emphasizing that the lifetime of water h - bond with base group is twice longer than that with ribose or phosphate group . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the lifetime of hbs in bulk water ( @xmath56 ps ) at 310 k ( see fig.[fig : water_preq1]c ) , the overall relaxation time of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and water is @xmath57 orders of magnitude longer , which suggests that the slow dynamics of water near rna is due to stronger interactions with the nucleotide or reduced diffusion constant of water on the rna surface . </S>",
    "<S> although counterions also play a central role in modulating rna structure @xcite and binding or release dynamics of na@xmath58 ions at the surface of rna would certainly perturb the water environment , the time scales of such events are far slower than the time scale of hydration . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time of counterion dynamics at the surface of rna is @xmath59 ns , @xmath60 ns , and @xmath61 ns , which are more than two orders of magnitude slower than that of water molecules , the details of which we will report elsewhere . due to the large time scale separation between water and ion dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , the hydration dynamics around rna is expected to occur effectively in a static quenched counterion environment .    </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy of time scales needed to describe the slow hydration dynamics is reminiscent of glassy dynamics . as stated above , it is also possible to fit the relaxation data using stretched exponential . nevertheless , the multi - phasic kinetics , originating from the heterogeneity of conformations that rna samples on fast time time scales facilitated by water ( acting as a lubricant ) , should be distinguished from glass - like behavior in highly supercooled materials at low temperatures ( see below , fig.[fig : water_preq1 ] ) . at @xmath4=310 </S>",
    "<S> k , we show that the majority ( @xmath6290 % ) of water hb dynamics are well described by considering double exponential function with two distinct time scales . just like proteins @xcite , water molecules interacting with rna exist in diverse forms , which leads to a broad temporal scale in dynamics . based on the well - separated time scales describing the decay of @xmath35 we classify water molecules into bulk ( @xmath63 ps ) , surface ( @xmath64 ps ) , cleft ( @xmath65 ps ) , and buried water ( @xmath66 ps ) @xcite groups . </S>",

    "<S> the small value of @xmath109 suggests that bulk water may be a strong liquid at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> _ dynamics of surface water : _ compared with bulk water , the dynamics of water molecules near rna is slower by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in the studied temperature range ( figs.[fig : water_preq1]b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> water molecules hydrated near rna surface , however , also have a hierarchical structure in dynamical property ( fig.[fig : water_preq1 ] ) . at @xmath110 </S>",
    "<S> k , the water hb dynamics is well fit using @xmath111 , suggesting that the water hb dynamics is governed by the time scale of @xmath112 ps with the contribution from bulk water - like property being only @xmath113 % . it would be more appropriate to interpret the hydrated water near rna surface with longer time scale by using , rna structure - dependent description such as ,  surface \" ,  cleft \" , and  buried \"- water instead of  cage effect \" in supercooled water in the bulk . as temperature is decreased , the contribution of the  bulk \"- water ( @xmath91 ps ) diminishes and the contributions from  surface \" ,  cleft \" , and  buried \"- water becomes more dominant in the population of water interacting with rna .    the relaxation dynamics of hb for surface water </S>",
    "<S> can also be analyzed using arrhenius equation over the temperature range @xmath114 k ( fig.[fig : water_preq1]c ) : ( i ) @xmath115 suggests that the activation energies associated with breaking water h - bond from 24u and 35a are twice larger than those associated with 29a , 33c or bulk waters ; ( ii ) each class of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 @xmath119 ps ) and @xmath120 , @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ps ) has the time constant in a similar range . </S>",
    "<S> note that 24u and 35a have a base group accessible to the solvent environment , while 29a and 33c do not . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of time constants of 24u and 35a with that of the bulk water indicates that the diffusional property of water interacting with 24u and 35a are effectively identical to that of bulk water . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the above analysis allows us to divide the water dynamics near rna at least into two classes . </S>",
    "<S> one is the class in which activation barrier for water hb disruption is increased but the time constant for vibration remains identical to bulk water ( water around 24u , 35a ) ; the other is the class in which activation barrier remains identical but the time constant for vibration is reduced by two orders of magnitude from that of bulk water ( water around 29a , 33c ) .      despite fundamental difference between the chemical composition of rna and proteins ( for example rna with limited chemical diversity in the nucleotides </S>",
    "<S> is highly charged along the phosphodiester backbone whereas there is considerable diversity in the makeup of natural protein sequences ) , we find that globally there are some similarities in the hydration dynamics in these biopolymers . </S>",
    "<S> similar to proteins , rna displays a dynamical transition signaling a harmonic - to - anharmonic change in the msd at the near universal dynamical temperature , @xmath7 k. this near universal value for @xmath3 suggests that the dynamical transition has more to do with solvent dynamics than with any conformational fluctuations associated with rna or protein , as this study and others previously have surmised @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> water molecules interacting with rna surface exhibit a broad spectrum of time scales , reflecting the underlying architecture of the folded rna . at the ambient temperature , </S>",
    "<S> dynamics of bulk water occurs on the time scale of @xmath123 ps as assessed in terms of hydrogen bond formation and disruption @xcite . in sharp contrast , near rna surface </S>",
    "<S> the time scale of water hb with nucleotides exceeds @xmath124 ps . although bulk and surface water molecules constitute the major population near rna surface , there is non - negligible population of water molecules whose time scale of interaction with nucleotide extends beyond nsec . from the simulation trajectories we find that these water molecules are either trapped in the narrow space formed between base - base stack , coordinated with multiple phosphate oxygens simultaneously or with specifically bound multivalent counterions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in these regions , which clearly require coordinated motion of several water molecules , must play an important role in ligand recognition by rna , as suggested by nmr experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we classify these as functional water molecules because the dynamics associated with these discrete waters might be responsible for the motions identified in experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our focus here was restricted to the elucidation of very slow dynamics associated with surface waters and those discrete molecules in the cleft of rna , which remains folded . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing question is : what role do these water molecules play in the folding process ? </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the persistence length of rna decreases dramatically as rna folds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the ordered state of rna is more flexible than the unfolded state , which is drastically different compared to proteins . </S>",
    "<S> based on the present study , we speculate that in the unfolded state , with exposed phosphate and bases , the dynamics of water associated with rna is also slow , perhaps even more so than when rna is folded . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that water molecules have to disorder to some extent before ions can stabilize the folded state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the folding of rna water molecules should exhibit rich dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of nucleic acids spans far greater time scales than proteins . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , over a period of time rna samples a larger class of conformations with ease because of the small stability gap @xcite separating the folded states and alternate structures . as a result </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that rna , even in the functional state , exhibits persistent heterogeneity or molecule - to - molecule variations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that in conjunction with ion dynamics , temporal scale spanned by water in association with rna also stretches out over many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> if this were the case then discrete water molecules whose motions are coordinated with rna structural transitions might be involved in function as well .    </S>",
    "<S> structural motions lubricated by the discrete water molecules associated with rna are pivotal in facilitating molecular interactions with cosolvents as well as with ligands or metabolites . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we showed that water molecules are critical for  inducing \" the base pair fluctuations , so that urea molecule can interact more easily with nucleobases @xcite . in the absence of surface water , the urea concentration required for denaturing nucleic acids rises to as high as 10 m @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , dehydration of water around rna due to stabilizing osmolytes such as tmao involves interplay of interactions between water and cosolvents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these aspects are worthy of future investigations .      * all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation : * we used the molecular dynamics package namd @xcite to perform atomically detailed simulations for the 71-nt adenine riboswitch ( pdb code : 1y26 ) @xcite and 36-nt preq@xmath0 riboswitch ( pdb code : 2l1v ) @xcite aptamers under charmm27 force field . </S>",
    "<S> for adenine riboswitch containing five bound mg@xmath9 ions , we added 60 sodium ions by placing each ion around the phosphate group of rna backbone , to make the whole system charge neutral . </S>",
    "<S> the system is then solvated using the solvate program in the vmd package @xcite in an explicit tip3p water solvent box . </S>",
    "<S> a buffer of water are added around the molecule for at least 15   in all directions , resulting in total 63,632 atoms in the system . </S>",
