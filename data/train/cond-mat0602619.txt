    "one carrier , electron _ ( e ) _ , or hole _ ( h ) _ , trapped in a dot , is characterized by a quantum number @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , its energy and wave function being @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if we put more than one carrier in a dot , they feel each other by coulomb interactions - and possibly by pauli exclusion , if their spins are identical .",
    "the coulomb potential in a confined geometry is characterized by a set of matrix elements @xmath14 between electrons , between holes and between electrons and holes , defined as @xmath15 in small enough dots , it is well - known that the energy of a few carriers is dominated by the kinetic contribution , and so that the coulomb interactions can be treated as a perturbation  @xcite .",
    "up to second order , the ground state energy of one electron - hole pair thus reads as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ground state quantum number , the second order coulomb term @xmath18 being @xmath19 in the same way , the ground state energy of one pair plus one carrier @xmath11 , with different spins , reads @xmath20 while the ground state energy of two pairs with different spins is given by @xmath21    the coulomb expansions of the carrier energies given above are valid when the dot size is small , more precisely when the dimensionless parameter @xmath22 , characterizing a dot of volume @xmath23 , defined as @xmath24 is small compared to 1 , @xmath25 being the bohr radius with @xmath26 .",
    "( for spherical dot , @xmath22 is just the dot radius in bohr units ) .",
    "the coulomb expansions ( [ eq : e0xexp]-[eq : e0dbar ] ) , valid for small dots , in fact correspond to a small @xmath22 expansion .",
    "eqs.([eq : e0xexp],[eq : e0dbar ] ) allow to obtain the lowest energies of one pair , two pairs and one pair plus one carrier for _ any dot shape and barrier height _ , up to second order in coulomb interaction : to get them , we just need to first determine the free carrier eigenstates , @xmath12 and @xmath27 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and then to use these wave functions in the @xmath28 coulomb matrix elements defined in eq.([eq : vij ] ) .    for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we here consider a _ model spherical dots with infinite barriers_. the problem is quite simple in the case of spherical dots because the free carrier eigenstates are then analytically known , the ground state energy being given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 . as the wave functions @xmath13 for infinite barriers do not depend on mass , the @xmath14 s do not depend on @xmath31 , the one between ground states being equal to @xmath32 .",
    "this makes all the second order coulomb terms @xmath33 also equal for equal electron and hole masses - while they differ for @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , in the case of spherical dots with infinite barriers , we find the following energy expansions : @xmath35    \\nonumber   \\\\ e^{(e h i)}_{0 } & = & r_x \\ , \\left [ \\frac{\\pi^2}{r_d^2 } \\left(1+\\frac{\\mu}{m_e } \\right)-\\frac{3.57}{r_d } - c^{(e h i)}(m_e , m_h ) + { \\cal o}(r_d ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ e^{(eehh)}_0 & = & 2 \\ , r_x \\ , \\left [ \\frac{\\pi^2}{r_d^2}-\\frac{3.57}{r_d } - c^{(eehh)}(m_e , m_h ) + { \\cal o}(r_d ) \\right ]   \\label{eq : e0dbarnum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath36 , all the w s are equal to @xmath37 with @xmath38 so that @xmath39 , while @xmath40 ( note that @xmath41 has a factor 2 in front ) . for different electron and hole masses ,",
    "more precisely , in the particular case of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which corresponds to pure @xmath44 , these quantities become @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 while @xmath48 ( the first 20 electron and 20 hole levels were taken into account to achieve convergence of these sums ) .",
    "the  binding  energy @xmath49 of one pair plus one carrier @xmath11 can be defined as @xmath50 using eqs.([eq : e0xexp],[eq : e0texp ] ) , we find that the second order term is just @xmath51 while the first order term can be rewritten  @xcite , using the definition of @xmath52 given in eq.(2 ) , as @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    in the same way ,",
    "the  binding  energy of two pairs can be defined as @xmath58 when using eqs.([eq : e0xexp],[eq : e0dbar ] ) , the second order term is just @xmath59 while the first order term now reads @xmath60    from eqs.([eq : d1iij],[eq : d1eehh ] ) and the definitions of the @xmath61 s , it is easy to check that a remarkable sum rule exists between the `` binding energies '' of two pairs and of one pair plus one carrier : @xmath62    let us stress that eqs.([eq : d1iij],[eq : d1eehh ] ) as well as  eq.([eq : sumbe ] ) are completely general , i.e. , they _ do not rely on any specific assumption for the dot geometry nor on a possibly non - zero electric field_. from eqs.([eq : d1iij],[eq : d1eehh ] ) we already see that the first order coulomb terms of these  binding  energies reduce to zero if @xmath63 everywhere , i.e. , if the dot has a local carrier neutrality .",
    "local carrier neutrality implies the absence of any external electric field which tends to tear apart opposite charges .",
    "we also need to assume infinite barriers or , possibly , carriers spreading out of the dot identically , for their wave functions to be the same .",
    "for @xmath63 , the first order terms , @xmath64 and @xmath65 reduce to zero  @xcite .",
    "if we now turn to the second order terms , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we see that they are both negative , for all the w s are negative , the sum they contain being taken over excited states .",
    "these second order terms , which are the dominant ones in small dots in the absence of first order terms , make the two binding energies @xmath49 and @xmath68 positive ( for the latter case , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that , in a small dot with infinite barrier , two - pairs , and one - pair plus one carrier , are always below the  dissociated  configuration , i.e. , twice one - pair or one - pair and one carrier .",
    "for non - zero electric fields , or for finite barriers and different masses , i.e. , different @xmath69 , the two types of carriers generally have different wave functions , so that @xmath70 differs from zero .",
    "due to @xmath71 , the integrals of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in eqs.([eq : d1iij],[eq : d1eehh ] ) , are dominated by the @xmath72 domain . as for such @xmath73",
    ", we have @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] , so that the integrand of @xmath65 is positive in the relevant part of the integral , whatever the sign of @xmath70 , making @xmath65 always positive .",
    "if we turn to @xmath64 , we see that , due to the additional @xmath75 , the important part of the integral given in eq.([eq : d1iij ] ) , is now the one for @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the sign of @xmath64 is controlled by the sign of @xmath77 inside the dot .",
    "as the electron is usually the carrier which spreads out the more , the hole wave function in the dot is larger than the electron one , for the wave functions are normalized .",
    "this leads to @xmath70 essentially positive in the dot , making @xmath78 positive and @xmath79 negative .    when the first and second order terms are both negative , as for @xmath80 , the carrier ",
    "energy is unambiguously positive , even for extremely small dots . on the opposite , when the first order term is positive , as for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , this first order term - even if it is very small , i.e. , if the electron and hole nearly have the same wave function - must end by being the dominant coulomb contribution when the dot shrinks .",
    "consequently , the carrier  binding  energy , positive for intermediate dot sizes - as it is then dominated by the second order coulomb term - must turn negative when the dot shrinks , in qualitative agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "therefore the phenomenon of competition between first and second order coulomb contributions drives the cross - over between binding and antibinding . in  @xcite",
    "we find a numerical calculation up to second order in the coulomb interaction illustrating ideally our argument .",
    "one even notices that our sum rule  ( [ eq : sumbe ] ) is accurately verified by fig.2 of  @xcite in most of the size range ( namely above @xmath83 ) .",
    "unfortunately in the antibinding region , below @xmath83 , a small discrepancy appears , probably due to limitations in the calculation of the second order term .",
    "nevertheless the overall numerical result of fig.2 beautifully confirms the findings of our analytical theory .    to conclude we state our main thesis which says that , in order to find an  antibinding  for two - electron - hole pairs , we just need @xmath84 , i.e. , a carrier local non - neutrality , while to find such an  antibinding  for one - pair plus one carrier , we need an excess charge inside the dot of the same sign than the additionnal carrier .",
    "this conclusion fully agree with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "let us end this work by taking again for an illustration , a quantum dot with a spherical geometry , and show how we can relate the dot size for the cross - over from ",
    "binding  to  antibinding  of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , to one of the important physical quantities for carriers in dots , namely their spreading - out lengths .    in a previous communication  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the energies of a particle with mass @xmath8 in a spherical dot of radius @xmath1 and barrier height @xmath7 , are given by @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 s for states with @xmath87 symmetry fulfil @xmath88 , where @xmath6 is the parameter defined in eq.([eq : vi ] ) . in the large @xmath6 limit ,",
    "i.e. , for large @xmath7 , this leads to @xmath89 for the ground state ; so that the spatial extension @xmath90 of this ground state , defined as @xmath91 , varies with the effective barrier height @xmath6 as @xmath92 .",
    "note that , as expected , @xmath90 is just equal to @xmath1 for infinite barriers , i.e. , for infinite @xmath6 .",
    "we now use this result in the  binding  energy first order terms , eqs.([eq : d1iij],[eq : d1eehh ] ) : since , due to dimensional arguments , @xmath93 , the first order term @xmath65 , given in eq.([eq : d1eehh ] ) , can be estimated as @xmath94 while the same argument leads to @xmath95 with a similar result for @xmath96 .",
    "we now define the characteristic length @xmath97 over which a carrier @xmath8 spreads out of a material having a barrier @xmath7 , as @xmath98 ( note that this @xmath97 is inversely proportional to @xmath99 , while it is exactly @xmath17 for infinite barrier ) .",
    "following part i , the second order coulomb term is of the order of @xmath100 , so that , from the definition of @xmath6 given in eq.([eq : vi ] ) - in which enters the dot radius - we obtain a cross - over radius from  binding  to  antibinding  which behaves as @xmath101{a_x ( l_e - l_h)^2 } \\label{eq : rcriteehh } \\\\",
    "r^{(e h i ) } & \\simeq & \\sum_{j=(e , h ) } \\theta(l_j - l_i ) \\sqrt{a_x ( l_j - l_i ) } \\label{eq : rcritiij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the step function .",
    "this gives a finite cross - over radius for @xmath81 whatever ( @xmath103 ) are , while the one for @xmath104 depends on the sign of @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 , which is the most usual situation , the cross - over radius for @xmath82 is finite while the one for @xmath80 is zero , i.e. , no cross - over takes place when the dot is negatively charged .",
    "eqs.([eq : rcriteehh]-[eq : rcritiij ] ) also show that when the barriers are very high , the spreading - out lengths @xmath97 are very small , so that the cross - over radii are very small . for usual barrier heights",
    ", however , the @xmath97 s are of the order of the bohr radius @xmath107 , making the cross - over radii also of the order of @xmath107 . in order to fit a particular experiment ,",
    "it is possible to get precise values of these cross - overs by going back to the expressions of the energies given in eqs.([eq : e0xexp]-[eq : e0dbar ] ) , the purpose of this last part being just to get _ a physical understanding of this cross - over by establishing its physical link with the carrier spreading - out lengths_.    one should not however conclude in all cases that charge separation increases when the quantum dot size diminishes .",
    "for example in wurtzite - type gan / algan heterostructures , where piezoelectricity or spontaneous polarization are prominent effects , charge separation effects may increase with the quantum dot size  @xcite , therefore the behaviour of  binding energies  with the box size may be strongly affected .",
    "a number of authors have made very complex calculations of 3d wave functions ( accounting for the details of the confinement potential resulting from the inhomogeneous strain , band mixing , and the piezolelectric potential ) , and subsequently have carried out configuration - interaction calculation of the biexciton binding energy .",
    "although it is not our purpose here to include such effects , our approach is able fully exploit the results of any such complex 3d numerical single particle wave functions : the contrast lies in the analysis of the results .",
    "an evaluation of eq.([eq : bindhbix ] ) with such wave functions allows to firmly assess the exact size limit for the validity of the strong confinement regime : for that , we just have to compare the level shifts of the two approaches . more important , eq.([eq : bindhbix ] ) also allows to assess the relative magnitude of the first and second order coulomb contributions for different dot sizes .",
    "note that in the second order contribution , can also enter a nearby continuum of states .",
    "finally , a numerical evaluation of eq.([eq : d1eehh ] ) allows _ to prove _ that charge separation is already of importance at first order , and being actually the _ main cause _ for the antibinding of two pairs .",
    "let us now show how the results presented here , which are completely general , would actually bring useful insights in the understanding of specific experiments .",
    "we focus on refs .",
    "@xcite where the transition from binding and antibinding is systematically studied , both experimentally and numerically .",
    "these authors find a qualitative agreement with experiments when the aspect ratio is varied , but not the dot size .",
    "their results also show that , in the two - pair ground state of the largest dot , namely 20 nm , there is still a relatively small mixing with the other excited states due to the coulomb interaction , showing in this way that , in smaller dots , the strong confinement regime is certainly reached .",
    "the antibinding is then attributed to a number of combined effects such as  3d confinement , quenching correlations and exchange , and causing local charge separation  , without precise evaluation of their relative importance , this relative importance being however crucial for physical understanding .    in order to show how we can analyze the results of the numerical approaches within our procedure , let us focus on the calculation presented in  @xcite . in this work , the authors do not vary the dot size to understand the transition to antibinding - which is the physically relevant parameter - but vary the number of confined states they include in the sums - which only is a mathematically relevant parameter .",
    "indeed , their numerical procedure is ( i ) _ to fix the dot size at 13 nm _ and ( ii ) _ to vary the number of bound states taken into account _ in the calculation , between 1 and 3 . from our approach",
    ", it is clear that there are fundamental flaws in this procedure : indeed , the confinement energy and the first and second order coulomb contributions all have _ a different _ , but crucial , _ dot size dependence _ ( see e.g.  the explicit @xmath22 dependence in eq.([eq : e0dbar ] ) ) these dependences having nothing to do with the possible variation of the number of confined states included in the numerical calculation",
    ". the latter procedure amounts to only change the magnitude of the second order terms , _ without any size effect_.    a refined set of calculations is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the previous criticism do not fully apply .",
    "indeed the authors convincingly show that a complex ci calculation reproduces the trend of the experiments when one truly varies the qd size .",
    "they attribute the crossing to  correlation  ( which we here simply call  second order corrections  ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite check that the number of excited hole bound states affect the crossing , whilst the electrons do not .",
    "we agree and think that this is a natural result of the smaller hole level spacing . however besides the convergence check we feel again that it is difficult to draw definitive _ physical _ conclusions about the actual number of bound states from this artificial procedure . in particular we note that there are also in principle contributions from the continuum , and when a higher bound state  disappears  , it merges in the continuum , however it is not obvious to guess how much this effect increases the contribution of the continuum .",
    "the  quantum confined stark effect  on one and two - pair states in small dots has also been investigated in two different sets of experiments namely , random local field  @xcite , or external field  @xcite .",
    "both show that the binding energy of two - pairs decreases with the external electric field strength at the dot position .",
    "such a behaviour is in perfect agreement with our discussion concerning the importance , the sign and magnitude of the first order term  ( [ eq : d1eehh ] ) in small dots , as a function of charge separation .    experiments  @xcite , involving the states of one pair plus one carrier ( the so - called  charged excitons  ) , with possibly an additional external field  @xcite , show that , in small dots , the binding energy is of opposite sign for the two types of excess charge , and that the trend to  antibind  is enhanced by the field for both types of excess charge .",
    "the authors explain it qualitatively by saying that the electric field tends to tear apart opposite charges and keep together identical charges , so that the repulsive coulomb interactions are wining over the attractive ones when the field increases .",
    "this first explanation is fully intuitive .",
    "( [ eq : d1iij ] ) shines new light on this problem because it demonstrates that , in the end , it is just this exact integral involving only the charge separation , evaluated with single - particle wavefunctions , that matters to understand the behaviour of the  binding energy  .",
    "we have shown , in very general terms , that the two - pair ground state energy , in strongly confined quantum dots , can possibly go above twice the energy of one - pair due to a single physical quantity : the local charge separation .",
    "our conclusion holds independently of the physical origin of the charge separation , which can be complex and internal ( e.g. due to piezoelectric fields resulting from strain ) , or external ( e.g. applied electric fields ) . even in the absence of electric field",
    ", local charge separation can be induced by finite barrier heights , the carriers spreading out of the dot differently .",
    "only the precise value of the cross - over is influenced by the complicated geometry of real dots .",
    "it is attributed to a competition effect between the first and second order coulomb contributions .",
    "while such an  antibinding",
    " always exists for two - pairs , it only exists for one - pair plus one carrier if the additionnal carrier is the one which spreads out the less . for illustration",
    ", we have , in the case of spherical dots , related the radius of the cross - over from  binding  to  antibinding  to the typical carrier spreading - out lengths induced by the finite dot barriers . as a by - product",
    "we have also found a remarkable sum rule for the  binding energies  of two pairs and one pair plus one carrier .",
    "finally , we have shown how our approach can be used to analyse the results of complex numerical calculations of two - pair states in realistic dot geometry , and how it allows to reinterpret a variety of experimental data in strongly confined quantum dots .",

    "<S> for a full understanding of this  antibinding  effect , we have also reconsidered the case of one pair plus one carrier . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while the carriers just have to spread out of the dot differently for the  antibinding  of two - pairs to appear , this  antibinding  for one pair plus one carrier only appears if this carrier is the one which spreads out the less . in addition </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable sum rule exists between the `` binding energies '' of two pairs and of one pair plus one carrier .    a very large amount of works are still devoted to the study of semiconductor quantum dots because of their possible applications in nanotechnology . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental aspects of these quantum dots are however now essentially understood  @xcite : when a few carriers of mass @xmath0 are confined in a box of characteristic size @xmath1 , their kinetic energy is of the order of @xmath2 , while their coulomb energy is order of @xmath3 ; so that , if the box size is small compared to @xmath4 ( the so - called  strong - confinement regime  ) , coulomb effects play a minor role  even if the absolute value of the coulomb energy in a dot is larger than the usual one in bulk , for the carriers are closer . </S>",
    "<S> this is why the physics of quantum dots is essentially a one - body physics , driven by confinement : besides small energy shifts and level splittings , many - body effects in a dot are not expected to be of great interest in these confined systems .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , a rather surprising  antibinding  effect has been observed in these dots : if one measures the lowest energy of two electron - hole pairs in the strong confinement regime , one finds that it goes from below to above twice the ground state energy of one - pair , when the dot size decreases ( see refs  @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that this is not really an  antibinding  effect because the carriers always stay bound to the dot due to the strong confinement . </S>",
    "<S> a two - pair energy above twice one - pair is however surprising at first because we are used to biexciton always having an energy below twice the exciton energy . </S>",
    "<S> this actually comes from the fact that , in extended systems , the excitons can move freely ; so that , to decrease their energy , they adjust their distance at an optimum value @xmath5 which results from the competition between the kinetic energy they lose and the coulomb energy they gain when they get closer .    </S>",
    "<S> the same argument may actually lead to think that the observed  antibinding  is in fact just normal ! indeed , if the particles get closer than @xmath5 , which is what happens in small dots , the energy of two - pairs in bulk should start to rise because of the kinetic contribution . </S>",
    "<S> it should thus end by getting above twice the energy of one exciton . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it may appear as reasonable to find a two - pair  antibinding  when the dot size decreases , the pairs ending by being too close .    </S>",
    "<S> this way of thinking is actually incorrect : in a dot , the carriers are forced to stay together , at a given distance , by confinement . </S>",
    "<S> they have no choice ! the kinetic energy necessary to stay so close , </S>",
    "<S> is actually paid once we put the carriers in the box . when comparing the energy of two pairs to twice the energy of one pair , we are thus left with the coulomb parts only . as the dipolar attraction between electron - hole pairs makes their coulomb contributions to the energy always negative , this should lead to a two - pair energy always below twice the energy of one pair , in contradiction with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to show that the energy of two pairs going above twice the energy of one pair can entirely be assigned to charge separation , whatever its origin . </S>",
    "<S> it must be pointed out that such a charge separation exists even in the absence of an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> it results from a  spreading - out  effect which increases when the dots shrink . </S>",

    "<S> this is of course impossible if the barrier height is really infinite : for such a barrier , the two - pair energy always stays below twice one - pair . </S>",
    "<S> however , for finite barriers , the carriers can partly escape from the dot and experience a subtle interplay between coulomb interaction and confinement , i.e. , interaction with the continuum linked to the environment of the dot  @xcite ; consequently , the price in kinetic energy needed to put a carrier inside the dot is not really constant but depends on the dot size , through a _ barrier - dependent _ term .    in confined systems , </S>",
    "<S> what is really important is not so much the absolute value of the barrier height , but its relative value compared to the characteristic energy of the dot , namely @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this led us to introduce  @xcite the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 which characterizes a barrier of height @xmath7 for a carrier of mass @xmath8 trapped in a spherical dot of radius @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter is defined as @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath6 is always infinite when @xmath7 is infinite , it goes to zero for finite @xmath7 when the dot shrinks : a dot size reduction makes a given barrier less and less efficient to prevent the carriers from spreading - out .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this work is to show that the charge separation between the electron and the hole of a dot leads , just by itself , to a two - pair energy going above twice the one - pair energy . </S>",
