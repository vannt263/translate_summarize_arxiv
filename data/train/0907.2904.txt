    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the implied luminosity of hd 18391 , @xmath93 , or @xmath94 , agrees closely with expectations from published semi - period - luminosity relations for cepheid - like supergiants @xcite , provided that the longer period ( @xmath95 ) applies .",
    "interestingly enough , both hd 18391 and v810 cen also fit predictions from the cepheid period - luminosity relation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "the results for the two fg class ia supergiants are based upon their assumed membership in anon ( hd 18391 ) and stock 14 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the case for v810 cen as a cluster member has been questioned on the basis of a conflict with the radial velocity of stock 14 stars @xcite .",
    "the case for hd 18391 also requires radial velocity confirmation .",
    "the radius of hd 18391 implied by its luminosity and effective temperature is @xmath96 , whereas a value of @xmath97 would characterize a cepheid of the same pulsation period @xcite .",
    "the implied radius also produces a value of @xmath98 with the effective temperature inferred from the model atmosphere analysis @xcite , consistent with the cited value of @xmath99 when non - lte and possible mass - loss effects are taken into account .",
    "but hd 18391 is clearly not a cepheid .",
    "its variability presumably originates from pulsation , radial pulsation if the implied periods are correct , highly damped by convection .",
    "variability possibly linked to the rotation of hd 18391 would imply a rotation rate of @xmath100 km s@xmath17 , much too large for a star that has expanded by two orders of magnitude since the main sequence stage .",
    "the color variations of the star are also in antiphase to the brightness variations @xcite , further constraining the nature of pulsation in the star @xcite .     , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the suspected , long - term , low - amplitude , light variability of hd 18391 is confirmed by recent observations of the star , although the light curve derived from recent ccd observations contains considerable scatter , a problem that may be associated with the difficulty of making accurate extinction corrections for observations from a site located near sea level .",
    "the dominant period of variability of @xmath101 is reasonably solid , but implies a semi - period of @xmath102 , smaller than the value of @xmath103 originally estimated by @xcite .",
    "the latter value lies closer to @xmath104 ( semi - period of @xmath105 ) found for the weaker second signal .",
    "a luminosity of @xmath93 is implied for hd 18391 from likely membership in a surrounding group of luminous stars that , with the g0 ia supergiant , are outliers to an anonymous , poorly - populated open cluster @xmath6 to the west that appears to be dissolving into the field . the likely age of the b - star subgroup surrounding the g0 ia supergiant is @xmath87 , or @xmath88 years . the luminosity estimate is consistent with the existing semi - period - luminosity relation of @xcite for such objects .",
    "it is interesting to note that both v810 cen and hd 18391 fit the period - luminosity relation for cluster and association cepheids extremely well , in fact unerringly in the case of hd 18391 , despite the fact that their implied effective temperatures and luminosities place them well to the hot side of the classical cepheid instability strip .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the variability of such cepheid impostors is still poorly constrained , although non - radial pulsation and effects tied to mass loss have been considered previously @xcite .",
    "the present results for hd 18391 suggest the possibility of radial pulsation .",
    "it is curious how well cepheid - like supergiants obey the classical period - luminosity relation for cepheids .",
    "it is not clear why that should be , although their presence among the luminous population of galaxies may be important to the identification and use of cepheids as distance indicators , particularly for low - amplitude variables .",
    "the authors are grateful to gilbert burki for kindly providing unpublished observations of hd 18391 that helped to extend the time baseline of observations for the star .",
