    "<S> the idea of secure communication of digital signals via chaos synchronization has been plagued by the possibility of attractor reconstruction by eavesdroppers as pointed out by prez and cerdeira . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we wish to present a very simple mechanism by which this problem can be overcome , wherein the signal is transmitted via a multistep parameter modulation combined with alternative driving of different transmitter variables , which makes the attractor reconstruction impossible . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated by means of the lorenz system and chua s circuit as examples .    </S>",
    "<S> the work of pecora and carroll [ 1990,1991 ] on synchronization of chaotic signals has suggested the possibility of secure communication using chaos synchronization . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that two chaotic systems can be synchronized when they are linked by a common signal ( driving signal ) provided the lyapunov exponents of the subsystem are all negative . following this suggestion a number of methods </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed for secure communication [ lakshmanan & murali , 1996 ; hayes et al . , 1993 ; cuomo & oppenheim , 1993 ; murali & lakshmanan , 1993a,1993b ; kocarev & parlitz , 1995 ; zhang et al . , 1998 ] with the help of chaotic signals . </S>",
    "<S> cuomo and oppenheim [ 1993 ] have shown that a small difference between the corresponding parameters in the drive and response systems will cause synchronization frustration between the transmitter and receiver variables . using this property , </S>",
    "<S> they have suggested a very simple method for digital signal transmission and illustrated it with the lorenz system . </S>",
    "<S> however , prez and cerdeira [ 1995 ] have pointed out that it is possible to reconstruct the message by an eavesdropper from a simple return map formed by the extrema of the modulated driving signal ( here , the driving signal is used as a carrier signal in the digital signal transmission . in our method </S>",
    "<S> the digital message is imposed on this carrier signal through parameter variation . </S>",
    "<S> so , we call the driving signal bearing the digital message as modulated driving signal and the modulation as parameter modulation . ) , even without synchronization with the receiver system . to overcome the above problem several methods </S>",
    "<S> have been suggested by many authors recently [ murali & lakshmanan , 1998 ; mensour & longtin , 1998 ; minai & pandian , 1998 ] : private communication using compound chaotic signal technique , using delay - differential equations technique , communication through noise and so on . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the above methods are very complicated and are often difficult to implement . in this letter , we describe a simple method by which the digital signal can be highly masked with the chaotic signal by using a multistep parameter modulation and show how it can be further complicated by introducing two different drive signals alternatively instead of a single drive signal . as a result , reconstruction of </S>",
    "<S> the message becomes virtually impossible and this provides further development in the technique of secure communication using chaotic signals .    in order to present our method , we make use of the dynamical system used by cuomo and oppenheim [ 1993 ] namely the lorenz system . the associated evolution equations at the transmitter end are @xmath0 while at the receiver end , corresponding to an @xmath1-drive , they read as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the parameter @xmath4 chosen for the purpose of modulation can have either the value @xmath5 or @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the parameter @xmath4 at the receiver end is kept at a constant value 4.0 , while in the transmitter circuit it is changed between two values , namely 4.0 and 4.4 , when the digital signal is zero and one , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted digital message is reconstructed by using the synchronization error power @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is negligible when the transmitter and the receiver systems are synchronized , while it has some finite value when they are not synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> thus the receiver will synchronize with the transmitter when the parameter @xmath4 in the latter takes a value @xmath5 , while asynchronization takes place when @xmath8 at the transmitter . </S>",
    "<S> it may be noted that instead of the @xmath1-drive at the receiver end one can as well use the @xmath9-drive in which case the eq.(2 ) will be modified as @xmath10    in the work of prez and cerdeira [ 1995 ] , it has been shown that even without any receiver circuit , one can unmask the message from the modulated drive signal . in this reference , the maxima @xmath11 and minima </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 are collected from the modulated driving signal and the new varibles @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined . </S>",
    "<S> the plot of the return map for @xmath15 vs @xmath16 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . note that there are 3 segments in the attractor each one of which is further split into two strips ( one corresponding to the high state and the other corresponding to low state of the digital message ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the split in the attractor is due to the change of the parameter @xmath4 at the sender end between the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 . from the return map </S>",
    "<S> one can easily unmask the message by finding the strip on which the point@xmath17 falls in each segment of the attractor . </S>",
    "<S> we can call the above procedure as a single - step parameter modulation , since @xmath4 can have only one value for one state of the message ( that is , @xmath4 can take only a single value @xmath6 for any high state in the digital message and only @xmath5 for the low state digital signal at the transmitter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the problem is then that from the nature of the chaotic attractor and the return map of the lorenz system , one can have only eight possibilities of message reconstruction from which one can easily discover the actual message . </S>",
    "<S> then , one possible way to overcome such a reconstruction is to increase the number of possible ways by which message can be reconstructed to an unmanageable level and thereby eliminating the possibility of identifying the correct message .    in our work , we have effected two changes in the mode of transmission of the digital message by the parameter modulation in order to complicate the attractor in the return map . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , in the sender part , instead of using a single - step parameter modulation , we use a multi - step parameter modulation , where for one state of the digital message ( either @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) , the parameter @xmath4 in the sender equation is assigned to have any one of the @xmath20 preassigned values ( @xmath21 and sufficiently large ) , while at the receiver part we use @xmath20 receiver subsystems with different parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we call the number @xmath20 as the step of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we will use both @xmath1 and @xmath9 signals to drive the receiver subsystems alternatively during the transmission as indicated in eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the block diagram of the transmitter and the receiver with modulation step @xmath20 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , where r@xmath22,r@xmath23, ... r@xmath24 are the subsystems of the receiver . </S>",
    "<S> each one of the @xmath25s is assigned a specific value among the @xmath20 chosen parameter values which are used to impose the high state of the digital message on the driving signal . </S>",
    "<S> the synchronization error power at the output of each subsystem is fed into low pass filters(lpfs ) separately . </S>",
    "<S> then the filtered signal is converted into a digital signal at threshold detectors(td)[cuomo & oppenheim , 1993 ] , which is then passed through not gates in order to invert and to confirm with the original assignment of high and low states of the digital signal . </S>",
    "<S> an or gate at the receiver combines all the outputs from the not gates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when the digital message imposed on the driving signal is @xmath18 , any one of the @xmath20 subsystems at the receiver will synchronize and the output at the or gate will be @xmath18. none of the subsystems will synchronize , if the modulated digital message is zero , and hence @xmath19 will be the output of the or gate .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our method in the case of the lorenz system with the same parameters used by prez and cerdeira [ 1995 ] and with the modulation step as small as @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the lorenz system ( 1 ) is known to exibit chaotic behavior when the parameter @xmath4 takes any value between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> one can assign a specific value to @xmath4 within this range for the purpose of modulation . </S>",
    "<S> we select the region @xmath29 for the illustration of our method . as an example , the parameter @xmath4 in the transmitting system is allowed to take any one of the five values @xmath30 for high state of the digital signal , while it can have any one the values @xmath31 for the low state . in the receiver part </S>",
    "<S> , we use 5 subsystems with the modulation parameter @xmath4 fixed at @xmath30 respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the method works as follows . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we have a high state in the digital message , to start with . </S>",
    "<S> then , the receiver is driven by the modulated driving signal with modulation parameter @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> for the next high state in the message the modulation is done with @xmath4 = @xmath33 and this process continues upto the @xmath4 value @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> then the value of @xmath4 is reset to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is also applicable to the low state of the message but with the modulation parameter(@xmath4 ) taking the values @xmath36 in that order . in the receiver </S>",
    "<S> part , all the subsystems are driven by the modulated driving signal . however , the subsystems @xmath37 and @xmath38 will synchronize only for the values of modulation parameter at the transmitter , @xmath39 respectively . when the synchronization is achieved in a subsystem </S>",
    "<S> , the error power will be below the threshold level and so the message obtained from td will be at the low state . </S>",
    "<S> it is inverted to the high state using the not gate . </S>",
    "<S> but a low state is attained by the digital message at the not gate , if the subsystem is not synchronized . </S>",
    "<S> thus a high state message is obtained as an output at the or gate if any one of the subsystems is synchronized and a low state digital message is recovered when asynchronization takes place at all the subsystems . a test digital message transmitted and recovered by this scheme by numerical simulation is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> actually the above possibility is only a test case and has been discussed for illustrative purpose . </S>",
    "<S> one can modulate @xmath4 in a random way also ( that is , at the transmitter circuit , @xmath4 can be assigned any one of the @xmath20 chosen values in a random manner ) rather than in a predetermined way . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented here is applicable equally well to such possibilities also .    </S>",
    "<S> the return map constructed using the modulated driving signal is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . here </S>",
    "<S> we have 10 strips in each segment . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath40 strips , where @xmath20 is the step of the parameter modulation . </S>",
    "<S> because of the complicated nature of the return map it is very difficult to find the strip on which the point@xmath17 falls in each segment of the attractor and so it is difficult to unmask the message from the return map . even if one can identify the location of the points in the strip , still one has a serious difficulty in assigning 0 and 1 to the strips since there are @xmath41 chances to make a mistake , for a successful reconstruction of the message . for @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , there are 7 chances [ pre & cerdeira , 1995 ] of making a mistake during the unmasking of the message from the modulated driving signal and for @xmath26 , this chances increases to a high value of 1,067,462,647 ( of the order of @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so it is almost impossible to unmask the message masked by our scheme , even at as low value as @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can complicate the attractor in the return map further by the second method . in the lorenz system , synchronization [ pecora & carroll , 1991 ] is possible by both @xmath1 driving and @xmath9 driving , since the conditional lyapunov exponents are all negative in both the cases . </S>",
    "<S> we use this property in the second method . here </S>",
    "<S> the principle of transmitting and receiving the message is the same as described above , but instead of using a single driving signal @xmath44 , we now use both @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the driving signals alternatively . for the odd digital bits , we drive the receiver by modulated @xmath44 whereas the even digital bits are transmitted using modulated @xmath45 as the driving signal . the block diagram of the transmitting and receiving systems with modulation step @xmath20 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . here </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath46 subsystems in the receiver , @xmath47 subsystems for each value of modulation parameter ( which are used for the transmission of high state of the digital message ) , one with modulated @xmath1 driving and the other with modulated @xmath9 driving . </S>",
    "<S> the recovered message is similar to the one obtained in our previous method . </S>",
    "<S> the return map constructed from the modulated drive signals ( modulated x(t ) and modulated y(t ) ) for the modulation step @xmath20=5 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 . from the return map , </S>",
    "<S> it is impossible to unmask the message since the attractor of the @xmath9 drive signal is merged with the attractor of the @xmath1 driving signal .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also applied our scheme to the simplest autonomous chua circuit generator of the chaotic signal [ madan , 1993 ; chua et al . , </S>",
    "<S> 1992 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the unnormalized circuit equations @xmath48 where @xmath49 $ ] during our verification with @xmath50 as the modulation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the other parameters value used are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the chua circuit can also be synchronized either with the driving signal @xmath54 or with @xmath55 and so we can again use them as alternative drive variables . </S>",
    "<S> one can assign any value to the parameter @xmath50 between @xmath56 to @xmath57 , except in some small regions where periodic windows occur . here </S>",
    "<S> the largest lyapunov exponent calculated has positive values and hence the circuit exibits chaotic behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we find from our numerical studies that it is even more difficult to extract message in this case with multiparameter modulation compared to the lorenz system , due to the nature of the chaotic attractor .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this letter , we have described two simple and straightforward methods to complicate the attractor in the return map of the modulated driving signal : one with multi - step parameter modulation by using a number of values to the modulation parameter @xmath4 and the other by using alternative @xmath1 and @xmath9 driving combined with multistep parameter modulation . </S>",
    "<S> we have illustrated them with the lorenz system and chua s circuit as examples . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is almost impossible to reconstruct the digital message transmitted in our scheme by the use of the return map formed by the modulated driving signal .    </S>",
