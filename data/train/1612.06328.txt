    "there are various settings in which links can arise in zero level sets of polynomials . among these",
    "the most prominent one is the study of links of isolated singularities @xcite . while only a very restricted class of links can be the link of an isolated singularity , for some types of polynomials every link is possible .",
    "for example for any link @xmath6 there exists a polynomial @xmath7 in three real variables with complex coefficients such that @xmath8 is @xmath6 .",
    "even for these types explicit constructions are known for only very few examples .",
    "dealing with explicit functions can be advantageous for studying some aspects of knot theory more closely .",
    "the critical points of the argument @xmath9 for example relate to circle - valued morse and novikov theory , which then connects to reidemeister torsion and seiberg - witten invariants @xcite .",
    "explicit polynomials are also necessary for applications in the construction of knotted field configurations in physics .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe a construction of such polynomials that works for any link .",
    "knots as vanishing sets of polynomials have been mostly studied in the context of isolated singularities of a polynomial @xmath10 . for all small @xmath11 the intersection of the zero level set with the three - sphere of radius @xmath12 around the singularity",
    "is ambient isotopic to the same link , the link of the singularity @xcite . for the links which arise as links of isolated singularities of complex polynomials , certain iterated cables of torus links @xcite",
    ", one can explicitly write down the corresponding polynomial",
    ". however , this procedure only covers a very restricted class of links . for a more detailed account of this topic we point the reader to @xcite .",
    "similar considerations apply to polynomials @xmath13 with ( weakly ) isolated singularities @xcite , but while some knots like the figure - eight knot have been explicitly constructed in this setting @xcite , a constructive method that allows to generate polynomials with a zero level set of any given link explicitly is still missing .",
    "akbulut and king showed in @xcite that all links arise as links of weakly isolated singularities of real polynomials .",
    "however , their proof does not offer an explicit construction of these functions either .",
    "knots have also been studied as real algebraic curves in @xmath14 in an area that is now known as real algebraic knot theory .",
    "the knots that arise in this way for polynomials of degree less than or equal to five or equal to six with genus at most one have been classified @xcite .",
    "it follows from results in real algebraic geometry @xcite that for any link @xmath6 there exists a polynomial in three real variables with complex coefficients , whose vanishing set is @xmath6 , but the proofs do not come with a method of finding these functions without using algebraic approximation , which is highly impractical in general",
    ". in particular , the degree of these polynomials could be arbitratily large .",
    "the functions constructed by brauner , perron and rudolph can be used to generate knots as such algebraic sets in @xmath15 simply by applying a stereographic projection and multypling by a nowhere - vanishing common denominator .",
    "we are confronted with a similar situation as in the case of the result by akbulut and king .",
    "while the existence of the polynomials on @xmath16 vanishing on @xmath6 is known for any link @xmath6 , explicit constructions are known for only very few of them . in this paper",
    "we describe a way of constructing such polynomials that works for any link .",
    "in fact , as in the previous constructions , we create a function which is defined on four - dimensional real space and is known to have the desired nodal set on @xmath17 and apply a stereographic projection to it . in order to do this , an isolated singularity at the origin is not necessary .",
    "all that is required is that the intersection of the zero level set of the function , which is defined on @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , with the unit three - sphere is the desired knot or link .",
    "rudolph introduced the notion of transverse @xmath21-links @xcite .",
    "these are the links that arise as transverse intersections of zero level sets of complex polynomials @xmath1 with the unit three - sphere .",
    "these functions do not necessarily have an isolated singularity at the origin and the zero level set on three - spheres of small radii does not have to be that same link .",
    "the set of transverse @xmath21-links is the same as the set of quasipositive links , which are closures of braids that are products of conjugates of positive artin generators @xmath22 of the braid group @xcite .",
    "we weaken the condition on the functions that rudolph studied to the effect that we are interested in complex - valued polynomials in complex variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". we call these polynomials _ semiholomorphic _ , since they are holomorphic in @xmath3 , but not in @xmath4 .",
    "in @xcite we described a construction of semiholomorphic polynomials with zero level sets on @xmath17 in the form of lemniscate knots , a family of knots generalising the family of torus links .",
    "the main ingredient of this procedure is that lemniscate knots are closures of braids that have a particularly simple parametrisation in terms of trigonometric functions . in @xcite",
    "we showed using the example of the knot @xmath23 that by using geometric considerations one can find a similar trigonometric parametrisation for a braid even if its closure is not a lemniscate knot .",
    "however , this approach is not algorithmic and very time consuming .    in this paper",
    "we show that the idea behind the construction of lemniscate knots can be extended to all links .",
    "[ thmintro ] for every link @xmath6 there is a function @xmath1 such that @xmath24 and @xmath2 is a polynomial in complex variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath2 is a semiholomorphic polynomial .",
    "the proof provides an algorithm that for any given braid @xmath0 constructs a semiholomorphic polynomial with the closure of @xmath0 as its zero level set on the unit - three sphere .",
    "note that stereographic projection from @xmath17 to @xmath15 then allows us to turn the constructed polynomial @xmath1 into a polynomial @xmath25 with the desired shape of its nodal lines .",
    "having an explicit formalism to generate polynomials comes with the advantage of being able to show certain properties about them .",
    "we can for example give upper and lower bounds on the degree of the resulting polynomial @xmath2 in terms of braid data , the number of strands in each link component and the number of crossings between them .",
    "this result carries over to bounds on the degree of @xmath26 , improving results associated to the nash - tognoli theorem @xcite , which do not contain any information about the degree .",
    "we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thmintro2 ] let @xmath0 be a braid on @xmath27 strands of length @xmath28 and let @xmath6 denote its closure .",

    "( [ eq : lower ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper ] ) respectively .",
    "the constructed polynomials also find applications in the study of a wide range of physical systems , including quantum - mechanical wavefunctions @xcite , complex scalar optical fields @xcite , nematic liquid crystals @xcite and the skyrme - faddeev model @xcite , where they are used as initial configurations .",
    "our algorithm hence provides a way of creating a knotted initial condition for any link type in any of these systems .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ main ] introduces the concept of fourier parametrisations of braids , which are essential for the construction .",
    "we then show how we can use such a parametrisation to construct a semiholomorphic polynomial with a zero level set of the desired form . in section [ algo ]",
    "we discuss a method of finding a fourier braid parametrisation for any braid , making our construction fully algorithmic . in section [ props ]",
    "we use the nature of our construction to prove , among other things , bounds for the degree of the resulting polynomials .",
    "we also givbe an upper bound for the morse - novikov number of a link and show that if the desired link is the closure of a strictly homogeneous braid , then there exists a semiholomorphic polynomial @xmath2 such that the argument @xmath35 of the restriction of @xmath2 to the unit three - sphere is a fibration over @xmath36 .",
    "the idea behind the construction of the polynomials is very much in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite , but is not restricted to a certain class of knots and is fully algorithmic .",
    "we use certain trigonometric parametrisations of a given braid @xmath0 to define a 1-parameter family of functions from @xmath37 $ ] to @xmath21 whose zero level sets are @xmath0 . identifying the 2-periodic variable with the argument of a complex number @xmath4 allows us to close the braid and define a 1-parameter family of functions whose zero level set is the closure of @xmath0 for appropriate choices of the parameter .",
    "the parametrisation of the braid is chosen in such a way that the resulting function is a polynomial in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we will think of a braid @xmath0 on @xmath27 strands as the union of @xmath27 disjoint parametric curves in @xmath15 , parametrised by their @xmath38-coordinate between 0 and @xmath39 .",

    ", we can identify the @xmath48 plane and the @xmath49 plane , which closes the braid to a link @xmath6 .",
    "note that there is a one to one correspondence between the cycles in the cycle notation of @xmath50 and the components of the link @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the length of each cycle is equal to the number of strands making up the corresponding link component .",
    "projecting the strands @xmath51 on the @xmath52 plane will typically result in a braid diagram that allows to read off the braid word of @xmath0 , that is the element of the braid group on @xmath27 strands @xmath53 corresponding to @xmath0 in terms of the artin generators @xmath54 .",

    "the first step of the algorithm is to find a parametrisation of the braid @xmath0 as in eq .",

    "every @xmath61 is by definition a polynomial in the complex variable @xmath3 , but its dependence on @xmath62 is determined by the parametrisation . in section [ fourier ]",
    "we show that if the braid parametrisation is of a certain form , @xmath61 is a polynomial in @xmath3 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as",
    "such it is the restriction of a semiholomorphic polynomial @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "note that @xmath67 can be obtained from @xmath61 simply by replacing every instance of @xmath63 by a complex variable @xmath4 and @xmath64 by @xmath5 , the complex conjugate of @xmath4 .",

    "the cycles of @xmath50 correspond to the link components of the closure of @xmath0 .",

    "we are going to show this for knots , so there is only one cycle in @xmath50 . since @xmath61 is the product over the functions associated with each cycle , this will show that @xmath61 is a product of polynomials and hence a polynomial itself for any braid .",
    "since @xmath61 has exactly @xmath27 factors , every term of @xmath61 after expanding the product consists of exactly @xmath27 terms which can each be @xmath3 or @xmath91 for some non - zero integer @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
