    "in this paper we conduct an investigation of the behavior of a periodically driven nonlinear mechanical system .",
    "the system is of interest both from the point of view of the relatively rich structure it possesses and also because it is fairly easy to construct a mechanical model of it .",
    "we begin with some standard techniques used to analyze such systems .",
    "bifurcation diagrams are plotted which locate regions of quasiperiodic , periodic and chaotic behavior within the parameter space of the system .",
    "dimensions of the attractor are calculated for different values of control parameters and compared with dimensions estimated from lyapunov exponents .",
    "numerical results obtained are in agreement with the kaplan - yorke conjecture .",
    "multiple attractors are found in different regions in parameter space .",
    "the most interesting is the coexistence of a chaotic attractor and a limit cycle , which implies that initial conditions may determine whether the system will exhibit periodic or chaotic behavior .",
    "boundaries of the basins of attraction appear to be smooth for high dissipation in the system , and they show fractal structure as the dissipation decreases . creation and destruction of multiple attractors in this model is caused by tangent bifurcations and crisis phenomena .",
    "this illustrates how even a simple nonlinear mechanical system may exhibit fairly complex behavior and posses a variety of chaotic features .",
    "we also conduct a symbolic analysis of the system .",
    "symbolic dynamics provides almost the only rigorous approach to study the motion of dynamic systems .",
    "such an analysis of one - dimensional maps on the interval is well understood @xcite . for the simplest case of the unimodal map ,",
    "a binary generating partition may be introduced by splitting the interval at the critical point . by assigning the letter @xmath0 or @xmath1 to a point of an orbit , depending whether it falls to the right or left side of the critical point",
    ", the orbit can be encoded with a symbolic sequence .",
    "the kneading sequence , which is the forward sequence of the critical value , determines all the admissible sequences of the map . by means of the kneading theory ,",
    "all sequences are well ordered .",
    "the kneading sequence is the greatest .",
    "there is no allowed sequence which has a shifted sub - sequence greater than the kneading sequence .",
    "the symbolic dynamics of the unimodal map can be extended to that of two - dimensional ( 2d ) maps .",
    "two much - studied 2d models are the hnon map @xcite and its piecewise linear version , the lozi map @xcite .",
    "first of all , one needs to construct a ` good ' binary partition for them . in ref.@xcite , by considering all ` primary ' homoclinic tangencies of the hnon map , a method for determining a partition line was proposed .",
    "once the binary partition is determined , any orbit may be associated with a doubly infinite symbolic sequence @xmath2 where @xmath3 indicates the code of the initial point .",
    "the forward sequence @xmath4 and backward sequence @xmath5 correspond to the forward and backward orbits of the initial point , respectively . in ref.@xcite the ordering rules for forward and backward sequences",
    "were discussed , and by introducing a metric representation of sequences the symbolic plane was constructed .",
    "it was pointed out that every primary homoclinic tangency cuts out a rectangle of forbidden sequences in the symbolic plane .",
    "the rectangles so deleted build up a pruning front which is monotonic across half the symbolic plane . by generalizing stable and unstable manifolds of an unstable fixed or periodic point to forward and",
    "backward foliations of any point @xcite , homoclinic tangencies are generalized to tangencies between the two classes of foliations . in terms of the generalization , we can make symbolic analysis of the orbits not only in but also out of attractor , including transient orbits .",
    "the extension of symbolic dynamics of maps from 1d to 2d is made by decomposing a 2d map into two 1d maps based on forward and backward foliations .",
    "the coupling between the two 1d maps is described by the pruning front or the symbolic representation of the partition line .",
    "an attractor is associated with backward foliations .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated that a properly constructed two - dimensional symbolic dynamics , being a coarse - grained description , provides a powerful tool to capture global , topological aspects of low - dimensional dissipative systems of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , to have a further global understanding of the bifurcation and chaos `` spectrum '' in the system we have studied @xcite , i.e. the systematics of stable and unstable periodic orbits at varying and fixed parameters , the types of chaotic attractors , etc .",
    ", we shall carry out a full analysis of symbolic dynamics for this mechanical model .",
    "based on the primary tangencies between forward and backward foliations in the poincar section the appropriate partition of the phase space is made and three letters are used to describe the dynamics . from the ordering rules and metric representation of forward and backward sequences symbolic planes are constructed and the admissibility conditions for allowed sequences derived .",
    "unstable allowed periodic orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor are predicted through symbolic analysis and verified numerically as well . in the parameter space period windows are located and the corresponding period words are determined according to the partitioning of phase portraits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section section [ p1 ] a brief description of the mechanical system and a derivation of the equations of motion",
    "is given . in section [ p2 ] chaos",
    "is detected , and regions of periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic behavior are located within the parameter space .",
    "lyapunov exponents and associated dimensions are calculated for certain attractors , and the kaplan - yorke conjecture is established . in section [ sec : cox ] crisis phenomena and coexisting attractors are studied .",
    "we next turn to the symbolic dynamics of the module . in section [ sec2 ] , the global dynamical behavior of the system while parameters vary",
    "are shown in phase space , and the partition lines are determined from tangencies between forward and backward foliations in the poincar section . in section [ sec3 ] by introducing a metric representation of forward and backward sequences according to their ordering rule the symbolic plane is constructed , and the admissibility condition of sequences is discussed .",
    "we then analyze the admissibility of periodic sequences based on a finite number of points on the partition lines , and give the numerical results of allowed periodic orbits in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we also locate the period windows for some range of parameters , assign words to the stable period orbits based on the partitioning of phase space , and discuss their ordering properties as parameters change in section [ sec5 ] . in section [ prop ]",
    "we discuss some aspects of this model as used in a mechanical propulsion device .",
    "finally , in section [ con ] we present some conclusions .",
    "= 7 cm [ fig : rod ]    the system we study consists of two gears and a rod . the first one , the solar gear , has radius @xmath6 , and is fixed so neither its center of mass can move nor can it rotate around its axis .",
    "the second , the planetary gear , is of radius @xmath0 and is attached to the first gear so when it rotates around its axis at the same time it goes around the fixed gear .",
    "we assume that the movable gear is powered by some device which keeps it moving with constant angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "when the planetary gear rotates for the angle @xmath8 around its axis it moves around solar gear for an angle @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rod ] ) .",
    "the relation between two angles is @xmath10 a uniformly dense rod of length @xmath1 is at one end joined to the fringe of movable gear .",
    "the rod can rotate around the joint , assumed without friction . both gears and",
    "the rod lie in a horizontal plane so the potential energy of the system is constant during the motion .",
    "we choose a coordinate system with origin at the center of the fixed gear .",
    "the system has two degrees of freedom , and a convenient choice of coordinates are @xmath9 , the angle that the second gear makes with @xmath11axis , and @xmath12 , the angle that the rod makes with the @xmath11axis . since the potential energy for the system is constant as well as the angular velocity of the planetary gear , the lagrangian for the system is determined by the kinetic energy of the rod only .",
    "a general expression for the kinetic energy for the rigid body that moves in two dimensions is @xmath13 we may express the position coordinates for the mass element @xmath14 over coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath12 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is position of the mass element @xmath14 at the rod .",
    "deriving @xmath11 and @xmath17 over time and eliminating @xmath9 rather than @xmath8 , using ( [ eq : angles ] ) , we get : @xmath18-                  l \\dot{\\vartheta } \\sin \\vartheta \\\\",
    "\\dot{y}=(1+r)r\\dot{\\phi}\\cos r\\phi-                  r\\dot{\\phi}\\left(1+r\\right )                  \\cos\\left[\\left(1+r\\right)\\phi\\right]+                  l \\dot{\\vartheta } \\cos \\vartheta   \\label{eq : dxdy } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "our initial assumption was that angular velocity of the planetary gear was constant @xmath20 .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume that initial condition is chosen so that @xmath21 .",
    "substituting derivatives ( [ eq : dxdy ] ) into ( [ eq : kinetic ] ) and integrating over the whole rod , assuming its linear mass is constant , we get the kinetic energy , and therefore the lagrangian , to be : @xmath22\\right \\ }          \\label{eq : kinetic2}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the moment of inertia of the rod , and we dropped terms that can be written as a total time derivative of some function and therefore do not contribute to the lagrangian . substituting this lagrangian into the general expression for the euler - lagrange equations of motion of dissipative systems @xmath24 and choosing @xmath12 and @xmath8 for coordinates we obtain the equation of motion to be @xmath25 \\right \\ } = q_{\\vartheta}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is some friction force that acts upon the rod , and @xmath23 is its moment of inertia .",
    "if we assume that the friction , as is commonly done for a pendulum , has the simple form @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , we may write the equations of motion as @xmath29 \\right \\ } = 0 ,          \\label{eq : rod1}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 if we introduce now a new variable @xmath31 we can bring the equations of motion to the arguably simpler form : @xmath32 this equation is nonlinear with a coupled term , and must be solved numerically .",
    "therefore , for convenience we will write it in a dimensionless form by introducing the dimensionless time variable @xmath33 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rod2 ] ) then becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 since we assume throughout this paper that @xmath37 is constant , the state of this system can be uniquely described in 3-dimensional phase space @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , from the fact that @xmath8 depends linearly on time we may infer that trajectories in phase space will be `` smooth '' in the @xmath8 direction , and that all chaotic features , if any , can be observed in the poincar section @xmath39 constant . in this way the problem of analyzing this three dimensional dynamical flow is reduced to the analysis of a two dimensional map .    equation ( [ eq : rod3 ] ) has a similar form to that of the equation of motion for the driven pendulum , as well as to the mathieu equation ; however , there are some essential differences .",
    "the virtual drive frequency @xmath40 in the normalized equation ( [ eq : rod3 ] ) does not depend upon the drive frequency @xmath7  the angular velocity of the moving gear  as it is constant which depends only on the dimensions of the rod and gears .",
    "on the other hand , the `` quality '' factor @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath7 , so a change of drive frequency will eventually appear as a change of dissipation in the system .",
    "for our system , we observe three characteristic regions in the parameter space ",
    "quasiperiodic , periodic and chaotic . in order to locate these regions",
    "we investigate the parameter space using bifurcation diagrams .",
    "such diagrams show the evolution of the attractor for a dissipative system with a change of the system s parameters . we choose to plot a projection of the poincar section @xmath42 on the @xmath43 axis against the system s parameter @xmath41 , while keeping other two parameters fixed .",
    "we repeat this procedure for various values of @xmath40 and @xmath44 .    with the increase of @xmath41 from zero on , the motion of the system is quasiperiodic , which is observed as a smeared region in the bifurcation graph . for certain value of @xmath41",
    "the motion suddenly becomes periodic , and with a further increase of the quality factor @xmath41 the system reaches chaos through a sequence of period doublings .",
    "for the parameters @xmath45 , the quasiperiodic region is relatively short , and chaos is found only in a narrow region of @xmath41 values .",
    "the richest chaotic structure is found for the choice of parameters @xmath46 . finally , for @xmath47 quasiperiodic motion becomes dominant over the range of @xmath41 , and periodic and possible chaotic behavior are found only in narrow isolated regions .",
    "solid proof of chaos is the existence of at least one positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "the spectrum of lyapunov exponents gives us , besides qualitative information about a system s behavior , also a quantitative measure of the system s stability @xcite .",
    "evolution of the lyapunov exponent spectrum with a change of parameters gives us additional information about the system s behavior to that from bifurcation graphs .",
    "combined , these two methods are reliable tools for examining a system s behavior and routes to chaos .",
    "figure [ fig : chaos ] gives a comparison of the bifurcation diagram and lyapunov spectrum evolution for a range of @xmath41 .",
    "since the system is represented in 3 dimensional space it is sufficient to determine only the largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "the other two can be inferred from haken s theorem @xcite , and the fact that the dissipation of the system is constant throughout phase space , so the sum of lyapunov exponents must equal to its numerical value @xmath48 .",
    "[ fig : pcr ]    a detailed description of the parameter space for this system is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we illustrate its main features with a bifurcation diagram plotted for parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chaos]a ) .",
    "the smeared region in the bifurcation diagram that is observed for the values @xmath51 corresponds to a quasiperiodic behavior of the system .",
    "although it is generally possible to notice differences between chaotic and quasiperiodic regions in a bifurcation graph , it is necessary to employ other methods in order to have solid evidence of a system s behavior .",
    "analysis of the power spectrum of the numerical solution is one of the methods that is particularly suitable for examining quasiperiodic motion .",
    "a power spectrum for @xmath52 ( fig .  [ fig : ffts]a ) shows that the motion of the system is a superposition of a finite number of harmonic modes , and therefore is not chaotic .",
    "the motion is not periodic though , since frequencies of harmonics are incommensurate , and the trajectory in phase space never retracts itself .",
    "the attractor for the system is a smooth 2-dimensional surface in phase space .",
    "the poincar section for @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pcr]a ) indeed reveals smooth attractor .    for values of @xmath53",
    "it is clear from the bifurcation graph that the system s behavior is periodic with period that is equal to the virtual drive period @xmath54 .",
    "this is also seen in the power spectrum for @xmath55 in figure  [ fig : ffts]b . with an increase of @xmath41 over @xmath56",
    "the system becomes chaotic through a period doubling sequence .",
    "the smeared region in the bifurcation diagram indicates that the attractor for the system has a complex structure in that region of the parameter space .",
    "the power spectrum also shows complexity of the system s behavior and indicates chaos in that region of parameter space .",
    "the power spectrum does not consist of a finite number of harmonics and their integer multiples any more , but is rather a broad band over the frequency axis ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ffts]c and  [ fig : ffts]d ) . in order to obtain a solid evidence of chaos one has to show that at least one lyapunov exponent for the system is positive in that region @xcite .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : chaos]b shows that the largest lyapunov exponent is positive in this region of parameter space , apart from windows of periodic behavior .    in particular , at @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "the largest lyapunov exponents are found to be @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the system s attractors for these values of parameters ( figs .  [ fig : pcr]b and  [ fig : pcr]c ) show characteristic stretching and folding pattern , indicating their fractal structure .    in the quasiperiodic region",
    "the attractor has dimension 2 , as the motion is performed over a smooth surface , while the limit cycles have dimension 1 .",
    "since motion takes place in 3-dimensional phase space it is reasonable to expect that strange attractors have dimension between 2 and 3 .",
    "we can use the fact that the attractor is always smooth in the @xmath8 direction , so in order to estimate its dimension we can estimate the dimension of its poincar section and obtain the attractor s dimension simply by adding one to it .",
    ".various dimensions of the attractors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "apart from its fairly rich non  linear structure , another interesting aspect of the model considered here is its use in a mechanical propulsion device . to see these aspects ,",
    "let us use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dxdy ] , [ eq : coord ] ) to solve for the coordinates ( in cartesian space ) of the center of mass of the rod .",
    "we are particularly interested in this section in the acceleration ; two representative graphs of the acceleration in the @xmath11 direction are shown in figs .",
    "[ xacc1 ] and [ xacc2 ] .",
    "similar results hold for the acceleration in the @xmath17direction .",
    "these graphs were generated with a particular set of parameters and initial conditions of the model whose precise values are not important for our purposes here .",
    "the interesting aspect is that the acceleration in , say , the @xmath11 direction shows a definite bias in favor of being larger in magnitude in for , in this case , positive values over negative values .",
    "let us imagine that we place this mechanical model on a cart which is resting on a surface and let it begin its motion .",
    "the acceleration of the rod will , by newton s 3@xmath61 law , cause a back reaction , causing the cart to oscillate back and forth . first assume the surface is frictionless . even though the acceleration of the rod is larger in one particular direction than the opposite one",
    ", the cart will not show any net movement  the larger acceleration in , say , the @xmath62 direction is compensated by the smaller acceleration in the @xmath63 directions which lasts for comparatively longer periods of time .",
    "however , let us now imagine that there is some friction between the cart and the surface .",
    "it is possible , with the right combination of parameters and initial conditions , that this friction `` absorbs '' the back reaction in the direction for which the acceleration is smallest , but does nt completely absorb the back reaction in the other direction . in this case",
    "the cart can `` push off '' the surface , and exhibit a net motion .",
    "similar effects will hold for motion in the @xmath17 direction , and so the net motion will be a combination of motion in both directions .",
    "however , if we place two such mechanical devices on the cart and have them rotate in opposite directions , the back reactions in , say , the @xmath17 direction can be arranged to cancel , leaving a net motion in only the @xmath11 direction .",
    "such a device has been constructed ( u.  s.  patent # 4,631,971 and u.  s.  patent application # 268,914 ) ; one rather striking illustration of its operation is that the device , self  contained within a box , when placed in a canoe in a swimming pool , will propel the canoe in one particular direction , without the need for a propeller in contact with the water .",
    "although perhaps surprising , the principle behind this device is intuitively known to many children .",
    "have a child sit on a piece of cardboard on a smooth floor and then tell her to move forward by rocking . if one watches closely , the child will rock in one direction quickly and return in the other direction slowly .",
    "the change in momentum of the child leads to a reactive force being transferred to the cardboard , but the uneven rocking results in this force overcoming the frictional force in only one particular direction .",
    "the net result is that the child will propel herself in one direction .",
    "in this paper we have studied a simple mechanical model of a periodically driven nonlinear mechanical system .",
    "bifurcation diagrams , dimensions , power spectra , and lyapunov exponents were derived in order to locate regions of quasiperiodic , periodic and chaotic behavior within the parameter space of the system . within the parameter space",
    "is the the coexistence of a chaotic attractor and a limit cycle , which implies that initial conditions may determine whether the system will exhibit periodic or chaotic behavior .",
    "we also discussed some aspects of the model as it relates to a propulsion device .",
    "this system , although relatively simple , exhibits a rich behavior with a number of interesting non  linear effects being present .    we have also performed a symbolic analysis of the model . by constructing the proper poincar section in the phase space for a system of odes ,",
    "the symbolic dynamics can be constructed based on the appropriate partitioning of the phase portrait and it turns out to be an efficient and powerful way to explore the global properties of the system both in the phase and parameter spaces . up to now , the symbolic dynamics has been applied to the analysis of the nmr  laser chaos model @xcite , the two  well duffing equation @xcite , the forced brusselator @xcite , and the lorenz model @xcite , in addition to the system discussed in this paper . along a certain direction in the parameter space",
    "this model exhibits various properties , such as , periodicity , quasiperiodicity , chaos , 1d and 2d features , etc . in some other directions or regions of the parameter space",
    "the model would also display more or less similar behavior .",
    "we have established the 3-letter symbolic dynamics for the model and found that the ordering rules of sequences , the forced brusselator in the regime of annular dynamics and the dissipative standard map at some parameters are the same . as a matter of fact , the nmr - laser chaos model , the forced brusselator in the regime of interval dynamics and the hnon map with a positive jacobian also have similar 2-letter symbolic dynamics and share the same ordering rules of sequences .",
    "it , therefore is meaningful in a sense to classify the systems of odes according to their ordering rules of sequences .",
    "the odes investigated under the guidance of symbolic dynamics to day are quite limited though .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ."
