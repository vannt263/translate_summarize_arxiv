    "there is a marked relationship between cell density , levels of c - signaling and behaviors in myxobacteria triggered by c - signaling @xcite .",
    "c - signaling increases with density since end - to - end contacts between cells are more likely with increased density @xcite and high cell densities favor spatial arrangements in which there are many end - to - end contacts due to the polarity of myxobacterial cells @xcite . cell density and c - signaling levels increase together from rippling to aggregation and from aggregation to sporulation @xcite .",

    "it is still not known if an internal cell timer is involved in myxobacterial rippling .",
    "several models with completely different assumptions all qualitatively produce ripple patterns resembling experiment .",
    "an _ internal timer _ is a hypothetical molecular cell clock which regulates the interval between reversals .",
    "the internal timer may specify a delay , or minimum period between reversals , which would include the refractory period , see below , _ and _ a minimum response time ; the minimum period of time required for a non - refractory cell to become stimulated to turn .",
    "also , the internal timer may specify a maximum oscillation period , in which case the timer may speed up or slow down depending upon collisions , but the cell will always turn within a specified period of time even without collisions .",
    "individual pre - rippling cells reverse spontaneously every 5 - 10 minutes with a variance in the period much smaller than the mean @xcite .",
    "this would suggest that there is a component of the timer specifying a maximum oscillation period . also ,",
    "observation of rippling bacteria reveals that cells oscillate even in ripple troughs where the density is too low for frequent collisions @xcite further supporting the hypothesis of a maximum oscillation period .",
    "the _ refractory period _ is a period of time immediately following a cell reversal , during which the cell is insensitive to c - factor .",
    "although there is no evidence of a refractory period in the c - signaling system , the refractory period is a general feature of bacterial signaling systems @xcite ( for a description of the role the refractory period plays in _ dictyostelium _ , see @xcite ) .",
    "the addition of .02 units of external c - factor triples the reversal frequency of single cells from .09 reversals per minute to .32 reversals per minute @xcite .",
    "cells do not reverse more frequently at still higher levels of c - factor , however , suggesting the existence of a minimum oscillation period of 3 minutes in response to c - factor . this minimum oscillation period would be the sum of the refractory period and the minimum response , so the duration of the refractory period can not be guessed from this fact alone .    to resolve the conflicts of these models for rippling our first lgca model is designed to test different assumptions .",
    "the results of our model for rippling shows that rippling is stable for a wide range of parameters , c - signaling plays an important role in modulating cell density during rippling , and non - c - signaling cells have no effect on the rippling pattern when mixed with wild - type cells .",
    "further , by comparing model results with experiments , we can conclude reversals during rippling would not be regulated by a built - in maximum oscillation period .",
    "we then present a second lgca model for aggregation based on c - signal alignment , which reproduces the sequence and geometry of the non - rippling stages of fruiting body formation in detail , showing that a simple local rule based on c - signaling can account for many experimental observations .",
    "lgca are relatively simple cellular automata models . they employ a regular , finite lattice and include a finite set of particle states , an interaction neighborhood and local rules that determine the particles movements and transitions between states @xcite .",
    "lgca differ from traditional ca by assuming particle motion and an exclusion principle .",
    "the connectivity of the lattice fixes the number of allowed non - zero velocities _ or channels _ for each particle .",
    "for example , a nearest - neighbor square lattice has four non - zero allowed channels .",
    "the channel specifies the direction and magnitude of movement , which may include zero velocity ( resting ) . in a simple exclusion rule ,",
    "only one particle may have each allowed non - zero velocity at each lattice site .",
    "thus , a set of boolean variables describes the occupation of each allowed particle state : occupied ( 1 ) or empty ( 0 ) .",
    "each lattice site on a square lattice can then contain from zero to four particles with non - zero velocity .",
    "the transition rule of an lgca has two steps .",
    "an interaction step updates the state of each particle at each lattice site . particles may change velocity state , appear or disappear in any number of ways as long as they do not violate the exclusion principle . in the transport step ,",
    "cells move synchronously in the direction and by the distance specified by their velocity state .",
    "synchronous transport prevents particle collisions which would violate the exclusion principle ( other models define a collision resolution algorithm ) .",
    "lgca models are specially constructed to allow parallel synchronous movement and updating of a large number of particles @xcite .      in classical lgca ,",
    "biological cells are dimensionless and represented as a single occupied node on a lattice ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "interaction neighborhoods are typically nearest - neighbor or next - nearest - neighbor on a square lattice .",
    "the exclusion principle makes transport unwieldy when a single cell occupies more than one node since a cell may only advance if all the channels it would occupy are available . similarly , it is difficult to model the overlapping and stacking of cells .",
    "cells without dimension are untenable for a sophisticated model of myxobacteria fruiting body formation , however .",
    "cells are very elongated during rippling , streaming and aggregation and form regular , dense arrays by cell alignment .",
    "also , a realistic model of cell overlap and cell stacking is needed since interaction occurs only at specific regions of highly elongated cells and cell density is a critical parameter throughout this morphogenesis .",
    "_ @xcite have mediated the problem of stacking by introducing a semi - three - dimensional lattice where a third z - coordinate gives the vertical position of each cell when it is stacked upon other cells .",
    "stevens @xcite has introduced a model of rod - shaped cells that occupy many nodes and have variable shape in her cellular automata model of streaming and aggregation in myxobacteria .",
    "neither of these two models are lgca since they do not incorporate synchronous transport along channels .",
    "we device a novel way of representing cells which facilitates variable cell shape , cell stacking and incomplete cell overlap while preserving the advantages of lgca ; namely , synchronous transport and binary representation of cells within channels ( e.g. , a ` 0 ' indicating an unoccupied channel and a ` 1 ' indicating an occupied channel ) .",
    "we represent the cells as ( 1 ) a single node which corresponds to the position of the cell s center ( or `` center of mass '' ) in the @xmath1 plane , ( 2 ) the choice of occupied channel at the cell s position designating the cell s orientation and ( 3 ) a local neighborhood defining the physical size and shape of the cell with associated interaction neighborhoods ( figure [ nbhds ] ) .",
    "the interaction neighborhoods depend on the dynamics of the model and need not exactly overlap the cell shape . in our models for rippling and aggregation ,",
    "we define the size and shape of the cell as a @xmath2 rectangle , where @xmath3 is cell length . as @xmath3 increases ,",
    "the cell shape becomes more elongated .",
    "a cell length of @xmath4 corresponds to the @xmath5 proportions of rippling _ myxococcus xanthus _",

    "representing a cell as an oriented point with an associated cell shape is computationally efficient , yet approximates continuum dynamics more closely than assuming point - like cells , since elongated cells may overlap in many ways .",
    "we have also solved the cell stacking problem , since overlapping cell shapes correspond to cells stacked on top of each other .",
    "this cell representation conveniently extends to changing cell dimensions and the more complex interactions of fruiting body formation .",
    "we assume precise reflection and investigates the roles of a cell refractory period , a minimum response period , a maximum oscillation period and non - linear dependence of reversals on c - factor independently .      1 .",
    "our model employs a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions imposed at all four edges .",
    "unit velocities are allowed in the positive and negative @xmath6 directions .",

    "3 .    every cell is initially equipped with an internal timer by randomly assigning it a clock value between 1 and a maximum clock value @xmath8 .",
    "we define a refractory period @xmath9 such that @xmath10 ( see a detailed description of the internal timer , below ) . if the internal timer @xmath11 of a cell is less than @xmath9 , the cell is refractory . otherwise , the cell is sensitive .",
    "4 .   at each time - step",
    ", the internal timer of each refractory cell is increased by 1 while the internal timer of sensitive cells is increased by an amount proportional to the number of head - on cell - cell collisions @xmath12 occurring at that timestep .",
    "when a cell s internal timer has increased past @xmath8 , the cell reverses , the internal timer resets to 0 , and the cell becomes refractory .",
    "reversals occur as a cell s center switches from a right- or left - directed channel to a left- or right - directed channel , respectively .",
    "6 .   during the final transport step ,",
    "all cells move synchronously one node in the direction of their velocity by updating the positions of their centers .",
    "separate velocity states at each node ensure that more than one cell never occupies a single channel .      we model an internal timer with three parameters ; @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the number of refractory time - steps , @xmath13 is the minimum number of time - steps until a reversal and @xmath8 is the maximum number of time - steps until a reversal .",
    "the minimum period of time required for a sensitive cell to become stimulated to turn is the minimum response period @xmath14 . during the refractory period ,",
    "cells are insensitive to collisions and the internal timer advances at a uniform rate . after the refractory period , cells become sensitive and during this phase the number of head - on cell - cell collisions accelerates the internal timer so that the interval between reversals shortens .",
    "this acceleration is density - dependent , so that many simultaneous collisions accelerate the internal timer more than only one collision .",

    "a particle will oscillate with the minimum reversal period only if it reaches a threshold number of collisions during each non - refractory time - step ( for ( @xmath14 ) time - steps ) .",
    "if the collision rate is below the threshold , the clock phase velocity is less than maximal .",
    "however , as the number of collisions increases from 0 to @xmath20 , the phase velocity increases non - linearly as @xmath20 to the power @xmath17 .",
    "while in the model of b \" orner _",
    "_ @xcite there is no minimum response period for a cell to reverse , and in the model of igoshin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite a minimum response time is an inherent component of the internal clock , our model incorporates `` on - off switches '' for a refractory period , minimum response period , maximum oscillation period and quorum sensing .",
    "setting the refractory period equal to 0 time - steps in our model is the off - switch for the refractory period , and setting @xmath21 is the off - switch for the minimum response time .",
    "no maximum oscillation period is modeled by choosing a maximum oscillation period @xmath8 greater than the running period of the simulation , so that the automatic reversal of cells within @xmath8 time - steps has no effect on the dynamics of the simulation .",
    "there is no quorum sensing if @xmath20 is set to 1 so that a single collision during a timestep has the same effect as many collisions",
    ".    if there is no refractory period , cells are always sensitive to collisions .",
    "if there is no minimum response time , cells may reverse immediately after becoming sensitive if there are sufficiently many collisions in one timestep .",
    "finally , if there is no maximum oscillation period , cells may never reverse without sufficiently many collisions .",
    "we define an interaction neighborhood of eight nodes for the exchange of c - factor at the poles of a cell of length l ( see figure [ nbhds ] ) .",
    "the cell width of 3 nodes is larger than 1 to account for coupling in the y - direction and the interaction neighborhood must extend at least two nodes along the length of the cell to compensate for the discretization of the lattice since cells traveling in opposite directions may pass without their poles exactly overlapping .",
    "a head - on cell - cell _ collision _ is defined to occur when the interaction neighborhoods of two anti - parallel cells overlap .",
    "a cell may collide with multiple cells simultaneously since the interaction neighborhood is four nodes at each pole .",
    "note that the specific shape of the cell is not important for rippling dynamics since the two areas of c - signaling are the only places where interaction occurs .",
    "nevertheless , a shape extending over several nodes is necessary to permit the necessary overlapping and stacking at high density since the exclusion principle mandates that each channel has at most one cell center .",
    "thus , the cell centers of two colliding cells will be separated by one cell length and do not compete for channels at the same node . also , for sufficiently long cell lengths , the probability of more than one cell center located at the same node is low even when the local cell density may be high .",

    "we are able to simulate a rippling population with arbitrary concentrations of both wild - type and non - c - signaling cells and quantitatively reproduce their experimental results in detail , as did igoshin _",

    "we find that ripples form with or without a maximum oscillation period over the full range of densities .",
    "when there is a maximum oscillation period , the maximum oscillation period must be chosen greater than twice the refractory period for the development of ripples .",
    "there is no upper bound on the maximum oscillation time , which is why the maximum reversal period is unnecessary .",
    "ripples develop most quickly and cell oscillations are most regular _ with _ an internal timer when the maximum oscillation period is carefully chosen with respect to the other parameters of the model .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that experimental results are best reproduced when there is no maximum oscillation period .",
    "a refractory period is required for rippling for cells of length greater than 2 or 3 nodes , and although there may exist a minimum response time of more than one time - step , it is an interesting result of our model that the minimum response period @xmath29 must be small compared to the refractory period . in particular , rippling occurs whenever the minimum oscillation time @xmath13 is greater than @xmath30 time - steps and the refractory period @xmath9 is at least two - thirds @xmath13 .",
    "the first condition is required because if the minimum oscillation period @xmath13 is less than the period of time it takes a cell to travel one cell length , two cells or a cluster of cells will stimulate each other to oscillate in place .",
    "the second condition that the refractory period is at least two - thirds the minimum oscillation period indicates that the minimum response time of a cell can not be too long compared to the refractory period .",
    "experiments suggest that the minimum oscillation period of a cell in response to c - factor is about 3 minutes @xcite . according to our result that the minimum response time can not be more than two - thirds the refractory period",
    ", we can predict the existence of a refractory period in myxobacteria cells , with a duration of 2 - 3 minutes .",
    "the wavelength of the ripples depends on both the duration of the refractory period and the density of signaling cells .",

    "notice that error bars that show standard deviations of the mean wavelength over five simulations increases with wavelength .",
    "a refractory period of 2 - 3 minutes yields a ripple wavelength of about 60 micrometers ( figure [ rdwavelength.eps]a ) , which corresponds well to typical experimental ripple wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between refractory period and wavelength given in figure [ rdwavelength.eps ] is a only rough estimate , however .",

    "since cells have a length of 5 micrometers , this is the smallest wavelength that may be resolved as there is only one cell length between subsequent high density waves . at very high density ,",
    "when the refractory period is 0 , cells may be stimulated to reverse every timestep , so that there would be , theoretically , a wavelength of only 1 node .",
    "however , cells will be uniformly distributed in this case and there will be no well - defined high - density waves . in the simulations described in figure [ rdwavelength.eps]b , density is increased while refractory and minimum oscillation periods have a constant value .",
    "the minimum possible wavelength in this case is limited by the minimum oscillation period .",
    "in particular , the minimum possible wavelength is twice the minimum distance traveled by a cell between reversals , which is twice the distance traveled during the minimum oscillation period , which is 30 micrometers in this example .",
    "thus , even as density is increased very high , the curve must have a horizontal asymptote at wavelength = 30 micrometers .",
    "reversals depend on the number of collisions a cell encounters which depends on the density of c - factor .",
    "thus the number of collisions required for a reversal , the quorum value @xmath20 , should be a function of the density of c - signaling nodes .",
    "the density of c - signaling nodes is a function of both cell density and cell length since longer cells have a reduced c - signaling area to non - c - signaling area ratio .",
    "thus , we describe optimal quorum values @xmath20 as a function of c - signaling node density rather than cell density .    at a low density of c - signaling nodes , ripples form even when both @xmath20 and @xmath17 are 1 so that only 1 collision during the sensitive period is needed to trigger an reversal .",
    "when the density of c - signaling nodes is greater than or equal to 1 , however , the chances of collisions are so high in the initial homogeneous population that cells almost always reverse in the minimum number of timesteps and , with no differential behavior among cells , a rippling pattern fails to form .",
    "ripples will form at arbitrarily large densities of cells and c - signaling nodes if the number of collisions needed to trigger a reversal is increased . when the number of collisions required for a reversal is greater than 3 ( @xmath39 ) , ripples develop more quickly if the non - linear response to density @xmath17 is increased greater than 1 .",

    "counter - propagating ripples appear to pass through each other with no interference , which lead sager and kaiser to propose the hypothesis of precise reflection @xcite .",
    "indeed , tracking of right - propagating ripples and left - propagating ripples in figure [ solitons2]a , shows that the waves move continuously despite collisions and subsequent reflection .",
    "inspection of the collision and subsequent reversal of two cells , however , shows there is a jump in phase equal to exactly one cell length if they reverse immediately upon colliding ( see figure [ jumps]a ) .",
    "this phase jump occurs because a cell reverses by changing its orientation rather than by turning : when a right - moving particle collides with a left - moving particle and reverses , it is exactly one cell length ahead of the left - moving cell that it replaces . when all of the particles within a ripple are in phase , as is often the case , this jump is also seen in the ripple waves as two waves interpenetrate .",

    "figure [ dwavelength.eps]a shows that the dependence of wavelength on the fraction of wild type cells resembles the experimental curve only when there is no maximum oscillation period assumed in the model ( compare with figure 7.g in @xcite . ) thus our model predicts that rippling cells do not ripple with a maximum oscillation period .",

    "apparently , the decrease in c - factor explains the increase in wavelength .",
    "the non - signaling mutants do not affect the pattern at all .",
    "as density increases , wavelength decreases and the larger number of cells are distributed over a greater number of ripples .",

    "when there is no assumed maximum oscillation period , the wavelength between ripples is large .",
    "the explanation for this is that a larger region of the lattice must be `` swept '' to collect an aggregate of cells with sufficiently high density to reverse another aggregate . in the extreme case where density is nearly zero",
    ", a single cell will keep traveling without ever encountering sufficient collisions , and the wavelength is infinite .",
    "thus , the mechanism of rippling may be viewed as a mechanistic  sweeping \" of an arbitrarily large area , in which cells modulate the area that they span between reversals so as to efficiently collect ripples of a minimum density .    at very high density , by the same argument , wavelength is small .",
    "the number of ripples per area increases so that the number of cells per ripple does not increase linearly with the increase in density , but less .",
    "nevertheless , ripples formed from high density initial conditions do result in ripples which are wider and more dense than ripples formed from low density initial conditions .",
    "this may not be viewed as a limitation in design , but as the foundation of another possible role for rippling in myxobacteria : the even distribution of cells over an arbitrarily large area .",
    "when there are both high and low cell density regions ( as in the simulation of figure [ solitons2]b ) , many high - density waves will form in the region of highest density , and fewer , lower density waves will form in the regions of lower density . at the interface between these regions , a high density wave encounters a lower density wave .",
    "the high density wave will reverse all the cells of the low density wave such that all the cells from the low density wave return toward the low density region .",
    "the cells of the low density wave , on the other hand , will not be able to reverse all the cells of the higher density wave .",
    "rather , the lower density wave will only be able to reverse a proportional number of cells in the high density wave .",
    "the surplus cells in the high density wave will continue without reversing into the low density region .",
    "thus , the rippling mechanism in a region of variable cell density creates a `` pulse '' of surplus cells within the high density region which is efficiently directed into lower density regions .    in summary , rippling is an efficient mechanism for both forming evenly spaced accumulations of high cell density , and evenly spaced accumulations of nearly equal cell density . in experiments",
    ", cells do not reflect by exactly 180 degrees .",
    "however , since most cells move roughly parallel to each other , models based on reflection are reasonable approximations .",
    "modeling the experimental range of cell orientations would require a more sophisticated ca since lgca require a regular lattice which does not permit many angles . in the aggregation section below",
    "we describe a model on a triangular lattice which could be adjusted to incorporate 120 degree reversals .",
    "although a cell is ready to turn when the internal timer @xmath11 is greater than @xmath8 , it may not be able to turn if the opposite channel is already occupied .",
    "this is another limitation of our lgca model .",
    "we handle this situation by continuing to transport the cell in its direction of orientation at each time - step until the opposite channel is available .",

    "the non - rippling stages of fruiting body formation include alignment , streaming and aggregation . during alignment , cells form aligned patches from a random distribution .",
    "while streaming , cells form long chains which move cooperatively into aggregation center @xcite .",
