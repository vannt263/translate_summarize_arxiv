    "since their discovery,@xcite the nature of the superconducting gap structure and pairing symmetry of iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) have attracted considerable attention.@xcite of particular interest are the 122 iron pnictides , a class of intermetallic compounds with the thcr@xmath4si@xmath4 structure in which superconductivity is induced by several methods of chemical substitution . aside from the more commonly studied substitution series of 3@xmath10 transition metal elements for iron in afe@xmath11t@xmath9as@xmath4 ( a = ba , sr , ca ; t = fe , co , ni ... ) , previous work has shown that 5@xmath10 transition metal substitution also induces superconductivity , for example in the series bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9pt@xmath9as@xmath4  where the maximum transition temperature @xmath6  approaches @xmath12  k.citesaha072204,xhu104525 studies to date on this system have focused on crystal structure , resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , and specific heat , but more detailed studies of the pairing energy gap are lacking and would be useful for comparisons to the more heavily studied bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  system .    in understanding the electronic structure of superconductors it is essential to use a comprehensive experimental approach , as each measurement technique has its own unique limitations and opportunities for error .",
    "for example , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is considered to be one of the most direct ways to measure the momentum - space structure of the superconducting energy gap @xmath13 , but in many cases arpes studies on fescs have disagreed with bulk probes on the presence or absence of nodes in the order parameter . this apparent paradox may be a consequence of the surface - sensitive nature of the arpes measurement or experimental limitations , where issues such as surface reconstruction , surface depairing , and/or resolution issues may impair the interpretation of experimental results.@xcite other measurements designed to probe the gap structure similarly suffer from probe - dependent circumstances or are simply less direct probes of a gap s angular dependence .",
    "for this reason , we have taken the approach of comparing and contrasting four separate techniques : thermal conductivity , point - contact spectroscopy , arpes , and raman spectroscopy to investigate the bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9pt@xmath9as@xmath4  system .",
    "furthermore , we utilize samples for each experiment taken from the same synthesis batch , minimizing the error associated with comparisons of experimental results obtained from samples with varying quality , properties and origins , an issue particularly important in systems where chemical substitution is required .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements provide a powerful probe of electronic excitations in the zero temperature limit , when phonons have been frozen out . in a conducting solid at low temperatures ,",
    "the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity @xmath14 can be modeled as @xmath15 , where the @xmath16-linear term @xmath17 represents the electronic contribution to heat conduction , while the @xmath18 term represents the phonon contribution , where @xmath19 . by measuring @xmath20 in the zero temperature limit the electron contribution",
    "can be isolated , given by @xmath21 .",
    "it has been shown that the presence or absence of this residual thermal conductivity at zero magnetic field and its evolution in field can reveal the presence or absence of nodes or zeroes in the order parameter and provide additional information about gap structure .",
    "@xcite for example , in the @xmath10-wave cuprate superconductors @xmath22  is nonzero at zero magnetic field.@xcite the presence of this same residual thermal conductivity has also been used as evidence for nodal @xmath23-wave or @xmath10-wave pairing in fescs such as bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  ( ref .  ) and kfe@xmath4as@xmath4  ( ref .  ) .",

    "the lack of any increase in residual term in bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  is made even more clear when plotted as a function of field normalized to @xmath68  ( using 65  t for bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  as a conservative estimate ) : the evolution in bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  is comparable to that of elemental nb ( ref .  ) , and is in stark contrast to that of the @xmath10-wave and multiband @xmath23-wave superconductors tl-2201 and nbse@xmath4 , respectively . within the fesc family , such a flat response is not unprecedented , and is in fact favorably comparable to the full isotropic gap scenarios deduced for both ba@xmath69k@xmath70fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( ref .  ) and lifeas ( ref .  ) .    in the case of a multi - band scenario , which is the case for bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  as measured by arpes ( see sect .",
    "v ) , the suppression of the maximum energy gap on portions of the band structure can lead to an enhancement of tunneling between vortex core bound states , resulting in an effectively reduced critical field for those portions . in the case of nbse@xmath4",
    ", this field scale is identified with a shoulder in @xmath71 near @xmath72 , consistent with an energy gap ratio @xmath73 as follows from the fact that @xmath74@xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the fermi velocity.@xcite in comparison , in bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  the lack of any rise whatsoever in @xmath71 in the field range studied up to @xmath77 suggests a much weaker reduction from the maximum gap magnitude on those portions of the fermi surface with a smaller gap , assuming the same assumptions apply . however , as discussed for the case of lifeas ( ref .  ) , the lack of any signature of a rise in @xmath71 can not completely rule out the existence of a smaller gap in the band structure , whose presence may be compatible these observations if for instance the conductivity contribution of the small - gap fermi surface is much smaller that that of the large - gap component , or if coherence lengths are comparable due to scaling of fermi velocities ( _ i.e. , _  since @xmath78 ) .",
    "in fact , the case of lifeas , as will be discussed below , is a pertinent comparison for the multi - band ( and multi - gap ) nature of bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  because recent arpes experiments on lifeas do indeed find indications of two gap magnitudes of approximately 2 - 3  mev and 5 - 6  mev ( refs .  ) , with mild anisotropies reported but with gap minima not reaching below @xmath792  mev .",
    "therefore , it is likely that bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  also shares the situation of having similar coherence lengths across bands , making determination of the gap anisotropies with thermal conductivity difficult and complementary experiments necessary for further understanding .",

    ", measurements of the current - voltage ( @xmath81-@xmath82 ) relation can reveal information about the nature of the superconducting gap(s ) if the size of the junction is small compared to the superconductor s mean free path .",
    "electrons incident on the junction from the normal metal with an energy of less than @xmath13 can either be reflected back or generate a cooper pair in the superconductor and reflect a hole back into the normal metal to conserve charge , spin , and momentum in a process known as andreev reflection.@xcite in a measurement of conductivity @xmath83 vs. bias voltage across the junction , the andreev reflection process yields an enhancement of conductance when the chemical potential difference is less than @xmath13 . for the case of complete andreev reflection in an isotropic @xmath23-wave superconductor , this enhancement occurs as a nominal doubling of the conductance that abruptly onsets at the gap energy . in the case of a junction with a large potential barrier between the normal metal and superconductor",
    ", conductivity is instead suppressed due to enhanced reflection at the junction , yielding the typical tunneling conductance spectrum .",
    "for an isotropic @xmath23-wave superconductor , andreev reflection leads to a flat doubling of the conductance from zero bias up to @xmath84,@xcite while in other cases the conductance can exhibit sharper and larger enhancements near or at zero bias , in particular in nodal superconductors which exhibit sharper , non - flat peaks in their @xmath83 spectra .",
    "however , it is known that zero - bias conductance peaks can be observed in point contact measurements due to a wide variety of phenomena .",
    "thus , consistency and replicability are crucial in verifying that observed @xmath83 features are indeed intrinsic and not artifacts of a measurement problem .",

    "4 features an abrupt low - bias peak with a width of approximately 2 - 3 mev , consistent with andreev reflection in the superconducting state .",
    "furthermore , all curves exhibit depressions or enhancements in conductance at higher energies ( _ i.e. , _",
    "closer to 5 - 6  mev ) .",
    "this overlap is emphasized by the inset of fig .  4 , which presents the same data without vertical offsets .",
    "5 presents the temperature evolution of pcs conductance spectra for sample s2 , now normalizing the @xmath83 data to the normal state spectra to remove the background contribution to conductance ( c.f . fig .",
    "this is done by dividing out a polynomial fit to the data measured at 18  k from each temperature data set . upon cooling below @xmath6 ( ref .  ) , the features described above clearly emerge and evolve with decreasing temperature to reveal a sharp conductance enhancement and a depression at higher bias , suggesting features with at least two energy scales evolving in an order parameter - like fashion .    to better understand the features observed in the conductance spectra , we employ fitting to the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) model , which includes several parameters which can be used to fit the experimental data.@xcite the @xmath85 characteristics of a normal metal - superconductor ( n - s ) junction are determined by the gap size @xmath13 , a unitless barrier strength @xmath86 , and an inelastic scattering energy @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath86 determines the degree of tunneling across the junction : @xmath86 = 0 indicates complete andreev reflection , while @xmath87 indicates the tunneling limit . in the low-@xmath86 case , the @xmath83 vs. @xmath88 curve contains a peak at zero bias extending out to bias voltages corresponding to approximately + @xmath13 and -@xmath13 , whereas for large @xmath86 , @xmath83 is suppressed at zero bias with enhancements at @xmath89@xmath13 due to a tunneling gap .",
    "the @xmath48 term generally changes the shape of the @xmath83 curves and is therefore also critical in obtaining a good fit to measured data . in the case of a two - gap btk model ,",
    "the fit parameters include two gap sizes , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , two barrier strengths , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , two scattering energies , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and an additional weight factor @xmath94 , which indicates the proportion of electrons incident on the barrier that interact with either gap .",
    "the composite two - gap btk curve is simply a weighted average of two single - gap curves .",
    "fitting the conductance spectra features described above yields a good fit to the isotropic two - gap btk formalism , as shown in fig .  6 for sample s2 at 4.2  k. in particular , the fit captures both low- and high - bias features of enhancement and depression of conductance , respectively , via two sets of parameters : the low - bias conductance enhancement of this sample can be modeled by the existence of a nodeless gap with energy scale @xmath25 = 2.5  mev , while the high bias depression is well modelled by including a second gap of magnitude @xmath13@xmath4 = 7.0  mev such that the fit closely matches the observed spectrum .",
    "these features are strikingly similar to those observed in pcs measurements performed on the two - gap superconductor mgb@xmath4 , which also exhibit peak - dip features that were understood in terms of a two - gap scenario with similar gap energies ( but of course a much higher @xmath6  of 40  k).@xcite    interestingly , significant differences in the fit parameters in terms of the @xmath86 parameter and broadening term @xmath48 were necessary to fit the pcs spectra for bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  .",
    "for instance , the parameter set for the smaller gap spectrum ( @xmath13@xmath0= 2.5 mev , @xmath90 = 0 , @xmath48@xmath0 = 1.0  mev ) indicates complete andreev reflection and a small broadening term , which is typical for such a transparent gap .",
    "however the larger gap spectrum ( @xmath13@xmath4 = 7.0 mev , @xmath91 = 7.0 , @xmath48@xmath4 = 7.0 mev ) appears closer to the tunneling limit with a larger @xmath86 and exhibits much greater broadening .",
    "the weight factor of @xmath94=0.6 indicates comparable amounts of andreev reflection and tunneling into each gap with more conduction into the smaller gap .    while it is not clear why such significant differences were observed in the modeled barrier heights and scattering strengths of the two gaps , such differences are not unprecedented .",
    "for example , a two - gap model whose larger gap also has a larger @xmath86 was observed in ba@xmath0@xmath8@xmath9k@xmath9fe@xmath4as@xmath4  ( ref .  ) .",
    "the unusually large scattering strength deduced by the btk fit for the larger gap , with @xmath95 , is also unusual .",
    "however , it is in fact not unreasonable considering the high quasiparticle scattering rates deduced from pair - breaking experiments.@xcite kirshenbaum _ et al .",
    "_  investigated pair - breaking scattering in a range of 122 iron pnictide materials with transition metal substitutions at the fe site.@xcite using their observation of universal pair - breaking behavior in these compounds , one can estimate the transport scattering rate for bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  based on a @xmath6  value of 23  k , yielding @xmath96 2.5 @xmath30 10@xmath97 s@xmath47 .",
    "this translates to an energy scale of @xmath98 16  mev , which is actually higher but of the same order as @xmath93 , suggesting there is a more profound question about strong scattering in the fesc materials as addressed elsewhere.@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the contrast between @xmath90 = 0 and @xmath91 = 7.0 can find an explanation in terms of a relatively larger `` impedance mismatch '' between the tip and the large - gap band than for the small - gap band . following the argument from thermal conductivity measurements on lifeas ( ref .  ) in regard to a mismatch in fermi velocities , it is possible that the observation of this large contrast in @xmath86 values and the ( lack of ) evidence for multi - band effects in thermal conductivity are not inconsistent .",
    "finally , the appearance of spectral features at energy scales much larger than the predicted weak - coupling bcs gap value for a 23  k superconductor , @xmath99 = 1.76@xmath100 = 3.5  mev , is puzzling but also not unprecedented in tunneling and pcs studies . for normal - superconductor junctions outside the ballistic limit",
    ", it has been shown that sharp dips can occur at higher bias voltage.@xcite a conservative estimate gives an electron mean free path on the order of nanometers,@xcite which would place our micron - size junctions ( assuming a perfect and full contact ) in the diffusive rather than ballistic regime , and outside the sharvin limit . however , as evidenced in fig .",
    "4 all sample spectra exhibit features at higher bias voltages , including both gap - like dips and andreev - like shoulders .",

    "observations of a small gap of 1.6  mev ( @xmath104 ) have been reported from pcs measurements using pb and au tips @xcite , which do not observe features associated with any larger gap as seen in arpes experiments.@xcite however , many studies have also revealed prominent two - gap features , such as shown in ba@xmath105k@xmath106fe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( refs .  ) and bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9ni@xmath9as@xmath4  up to x = 0.10 ( ref .  ) .",

    "current was injected in the @xmath42-plane and parallel to the @xmath37-direction using the soft point contact method , in which a small amount of conductive paint is used to create the n - s junction rather than pressing a sharpened tip into the sc sample .",
    "attempts to fit to btk theory showed a better fit for a two - gap isotropic @xmath23-wave model than for a single nodeless gap .",
    "these fit curves included estimated gap values of @xmath13@xmath0 = 3.8 - 5.2 mev and @xmath13@xmath4 = 8.2 - 10.9 mev .",
    "the authors also reported features in the measured @xmath83 curves at higher bias voltage that deviated from the btk fit which were attributed to strong electron - boson coupling .",

    "freshly cleaved optimally doped ( @xmath123 = 0.14 ) crystals.@xcite btk fits to the measured di / dv curves showed only a single isotropic gap of magnitude @xmath13 = 5 - 6 mev suggesting that if multiple gaps are present they are close together in magnitude .",
    "given the significant differences in gap structure observed through thermal conductivity across the bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  phase diagram , it is possible that the stark difference in these results may be attributed to their different co concentrations .",
    "terashima _ et al .",
    "_  examined the gap structure of @xmath123 = 0.15 samples using arpes and found strong evidence for two isotropic gaps.@xcite energy distribution curves showed two gaps with @xmath13@xmath0 = 5 @xmath89 1 mev on the electron pocket and @xmath13@xmath4 = 7 @xmath89 1 mev on the hole pocket .",
    "edcs measured over a range of angles shows that both gaps are isotropic within error .",
    "muschler _ et al . _",
    "performed raman spectroscopy measurements on bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  samples with optimal doping ( @xmath123 = 0.122 ) and slight overdoping ( @xmath123 = 0.17).@xcite based on the strong low - temperature shift in the @xmath115 spectrum which varies as @xmath124 the authors propose an @xmath23-wave state with accidental nodes in the optimally doped sample .",
    "slight overdoping resulted in a @xmath115 peak with greatly diminished amplitude suggesting that the gap is strongly effected by doping and disorder ( and potentially sample quality ) .",
    "the most agreeable conclusion regarding the gap structure of bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  seems to be that of an @xmath23-wave gap which is nodeless at optimal doping with nodes appearing at higher and lower co concentrations which do not appear to be imposed by symmetry and which are present away from the @xmath42-plane .",
    "however , some results appear to contradict each other .",
    "for example , pcs studies consistently argue in favor of an isotropic gap while raman spectra at multiple dopings suggest the presence of nodes . some have suggested reconstruction of the gap at the surface as a means to explain differences between measurements , but this alone does not reconcile disagreements between thermal conductivity , pcs , and raman spectroscopy , all of which are bulk probes .",
    "another possible explanation is differences in crystal quality , and thus impurity scattering , which has been proposed by muschler and others .",
    "compared to the co - substituted system , our results on bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  offer a more comprehensive conclusion of an isotropic gap structure as all of the samples used were made in the same batch and therefore are expected to have similar impurity concentrations and defect structures .",
    "furthermore , our results all support the conclusion of at least one gap with a consistent magnitude of approximately 3  mev , and all experiments point to an isotropic @xmath23-wave gap structure .",
    "looking at the co- and pt - doping comparison more directly , both optimally doped materials lack a residual thermal conductivity at zero field , indicating a fully - gapped superconducting order parameter . for the co compound , a nonzero @xmath22   emerges at small magnetic fields , while for the pt compound it remains zero at all fields observed .",
    "while the thermal conductivity of each material could only be observed up to a small fraction of @xmath41 , this may suggest subtle differences in gap morphology .",
    "pcs measurements on both yielded btk fits to nodeless @xmath23-wave models .",
    "results from our study with optimal pt doping seem to compare more directly with those of overdoped bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9co@xmath9as@xmath4  rather than optimally doped . both point to a two - gap structure with features present in the spectrum that do not perfectly match the btk fit , which may indicate strong electron - boson coupling in both materials .",
    "arpes measurements on optimally doped samples in both systems showed no variation in gap magnitude as a function of angle.@xcite in the co - doped compound , two gaps were consistently seen , while only one was observed in our study of bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4 .",
    "finally , raman spectra on both compounds feature low temperature enhancements in the @xmath28 and @xmath115 channels at positions which agreed with other reported values of gap size .    while we found no evidence of nodes for optimally doped bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4 , under- and overdoped compounds in the bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9pt@xmath9as@xmath4  system have yet to be explored as far as gap structure is concerned .",
    "it has yet to be seen whether similar nodes would appear or if the pt - substituted system would exhibit significant differences from co substitution .",
    "therefore , future investigation of the entire bafe@xmath4@xmath8@xmath9pt@xmath9as@xmath4  phase diagram is certainly warranted .    our results on bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4",
    "can also be used to draw interesting parallels with the multiband superconductor lifeas .",
    "both compounds present no evidence of quasiparticle excitations in thermal conductivity measurements at low magnetic fields , and show minimal gap anisotropy in gap structure as determined by arpes measurements .",
    "both also exhibit comparable small and large gap magnitudes as extracted from pcs measurements and arpes measurements in the case of lifeas , with a 2@xmath13/@xmath103@xmath6  ratio of approximately 2 for the smaller gap in each system .",
    "the multi - gap nature of both materials would seem to be in disagreement with the thermal conductivity observations , but can be reconciled if one assumes the coherence length is similar between the two gaps . in our pcs observations of bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4 ,",
    "the large discontinuity between z values for the two gaps is consistent with large differences between fermi velocities , which means that @xmath125 could be comparable for the two gaps as suggested for lifeas.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have used four measurement techniques to probe the superconducting gap structure in single - crystal samples of bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4 , finding reliable evidence for an isotropic one- or possibly two - gap @xmath23-wave model .",
    "thermal conductivity measurements show no sign of low energy quasiparticle excitations even at relatively high magnetic fields , with behavior comparable to other isotropic , single - gapped @xmath23-wave superconductors . while there is no indication of a reduced energy gap , the presence of a second gap can not be excluded based on the small relative field range that was studied .",
    "conductivity spectra measured by point - contact andreev reflection spectroscopy exhibit sharp enhancements and notable suppression of @xmath83 at lower and higher bias , respectively , which suggests the presence of two gaps .",
    "fitting to an isotropic two - gap blonder - tinkham - klapwijk model results in gap size estimates of 2.5  mev and 7.0  mev , corresponding to features in the spectra that have been replicated in several crystals from the same batch .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements observe an isotropic gap on both electron and hole bands with a magnitude of approximately 3  mev . finally , raman spectroscopy revealed excitations in the superconducting state in both @xmath28 and @xmath115 channels whose energy scales correspond with the 3  mev gap magnitude observed in other measurements .",
    "overall , we conclude that the optimally doped iron - based superconductor bafe@xmath0@xmath1@xmath2pt@xmath3@xmath1@xmath0as@xmath4  has an isotropic , fully gapped superconducting order parameter with no nodes or deep minima , possibly with band - dependent energy scales of order 3  mev and 7  mev .",
    "combining several experimental probes together rules out several extrinsic parameters , allowing for further elucidation of the peculiar multi - band nature and pairing mechanism of this and other iron - based superconductors .",
