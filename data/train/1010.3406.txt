    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has 19 free parameters .",
    "13 of these are related to the mass sector as the masses and mixing angles and phases of the quarks and leptons .",
    "if righthanded neutrinos are added , this number even grows to 22 out of 28 .",
    "when the masses and mixing angles are studied in detail , patterns seem to emerge . some of these can be explained by assuming a discrete flavour symmetry at an high energy scale , others by assuming the symmetry of a grand unified theory ( gut ) . in section",
    "[ sec : patterns ] , we introduce these patterns and in section [ sec : syms ] we show how they are related to new symmetries . in section [ sec : model ] , we present a concrete implementation of this idea in a model @xcite with an @xmath0 family symmetry and the pati - salam ( ps ) unificartion symmetry .",
    "this model has a positive and a negative message ( `` a beauty and a beast '' ) .",
    "the positive point ( section [ sec : beauty ] ) is that it is indeed possible to build a model that combines discrete and gut symmetries and explains many observables in the mass sector .",
    "the negative point ( section [ sec : beast ] ) is that there are unexpected effects in the combination of the two symmetries .",
    "this leads to a very enlarged higgs sector and to a strong effect on the renormalisation group ( rg ) behaviour .",
    "due to rg effects , a large part of the naively accessible parameter space is excluded .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] will conclude .",
    "the mass sector of the standard model seems to contain a lot of structure . firstly the mass gaps between down and strange and between strange and bottom quarks are more or less of the same logarithmic size and of order @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the cabibbo angle .",
    "the same holds for the charged leptons , while for the up - type quarks , the gaps are somewhat larger , being more or less of order @xmath3 .",
    "see also figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the masses of the sm fermions on a logarithmic scale . from first to last line : uptype quarks , downtype quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos ( here pictured in the normal hierarchy ) ]    a second place where patterns show up , is in the mixing between flavour and mass eigenstates .",
    "this mixing is relatively small in the quark sector , where there is one moderate angle ( @xmath4 , the cabibbo angle ) , as well as two small angles ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . in the lepton sector , the mixing is much larger and seems to show a particular structure .",
    "one neutrino mass eigenstate is an almost equal mixture of all three flavour eigenstates , while another mass eigenstate is a mixture one of two eigenstates ( the so called tribimaximal mixing pattern @xcite ) .",
    "see also figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "furthermore , we notice that both in the 12 and in the 23 sector the neutrino and the quark mixing angles add to a maximal angle ( 45 degrees ) .",

    "flavour symmetries ( for an introduction , see e.g. @xcite ) are symmetries that work between the three family copies of a certain particle type ( `` a horizontal symmetry '' ) , which is to be contrasted with the usual gauge symmetries that work between the different particle types of one family ( `` a vertical symmetry '' ) .",
    "+ family symmetries can explain many of the structures mentioned in the previous section .",
    "a simple example is the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite . in this case , some of the particles are charged under an abelian @xmath7 charge , that differs between the families .",
    "the @xmath7 charges are such that the original yukawa lagrangian is not invariant .",
    "this can be solved by introducing a new scalar field , the so - called flavon @xmath8 , that has the opposite charge as some of the fermions .",
    "now terms that include some powers @xmath9 , are again invariant . here",
    "@xmath10 is the cut - off scale of the theory .",
    "if the scalar gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) that is somewhat smaller than the cut - off , the mass gaps of section [ sec : patterns ] can be generated with only parameters that are `` naturally '' of order 1 .",
    "using non - abelian groups , mixing patterns such as the tribimaximal one can easily be generated .",
    "in particular the discrete groups @xmath11 and @xmath0 are often used .",
    "a second reason to consider flavour symmetries is that these can unify the description of the fermions .",
    "if the symmetry group has three - dimensional representations ( as for instance @xmath11 and @xmath0 do ) , the fermions can be represented as one representation of a large group instead of as multiple disjunct copies .",
    "the same can be accomplished by some grand unified groups .",
    "their name states that they unify the gauge couplings , but they also do so for the fermions . for instance in the pati - salam gut , instead of six representations to describe one family of quarks and leptons ( including a righthanded neutrino ) , one can do with two .",
    "we will see that in the pati - salam @xmath12 model , instead of @xmath13 representations , one can use only four . see figure 4 .",
    "model.[fig4],title=\"fig : \" ]   model.[fig4],title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand , relations between different particle types of the same generation can often be produced by guts .",
    "examples are bottom - tau unification ( @xmath14 ) and the georgi - jarlskog relation ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we conclude that a model that combines flavour and gut symmetries is appealing , both on grounds of predictivity and of unification .",
    "we build an extension of the standard model , where the family symmetry group is @xmath0 and the gut group is pati - salam . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "the model uses a supersymmetrical context , although this is not strictly necessary : a non - supersymmetric version of the model with the same main ingredients could be constructed as well .",
    "technically , the pati - salam gauge group @xmath16 is not a unified group , as even at high energies , there are still three gauge groups : the @xmath17 of extended colour and @xmath18s for left- and righthanded particles .",
    "however , we see that for the fermion representations , there is an unifying aspect , as the lefthanded quark and lepton ( @xmath19)-doublets are combined in one ps representation ( * 4 * , * 2 * , * 1 * ) , as are the four righthanded ones ( into ( @xmath20 , * 1 * , * 2 * ) ) . for each family , the fermions are now grouped in two representations ( that we will denote as @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) , instead of in six ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the discrete group @xmath0 is the permutation group of four objects and has 24 elements , grouped in five conjugate classes .",
    "it has two one - dimensional representations ( denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , one two - dimensional representation ( @xmath31 ) and two three - dimensional representations ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "in particular the fact that there are three - dimensional representations is important , as this allows us to put the lefthanded multiplets of the three families in one representation , thereby providing more unification .",
    "we do not put the righthanded multiplets together in a three dimensional multiplet as well . instead put them in three separate one - dimensional representations ( of type @xmath30 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 respectively ) .",
    "this has the advantage that we can charge the families under @xmath34 , such that the froggatt - nielsen mechanism , alluded to in section [ sec : syms ] can give suppression to the masses of the first and second generation .",
    "the fields are also charged under an extra abelian @xmath35 that is used to prevent unwanted couplings in the superpotential .",
    "the assignment for the matter fields is summarized in figure [ fig4 ] and table [ tab1 ] .",

    "their properties are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the vacuum expectation values mentioned follow from the minimization and the typical magnitude is approximately @xmath2 times the cut - off scale of the theory .",
    "the vevs are valid to first order in the number of flavons present in that potential .",
    "subleading terms in this potential have one extra flavon inserted ; due to the relative small vevs , these give relative corrections of order @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , these corrections are very well calculable and are crucial in reproducing the observed patterns .",

    "the higgs spectrum will include at least a field @xmath56 that acts as the electroweak higgs boson and some higgs fields that break the ps gauge group to the ( supersymmetric ) standard model at high energies .",
    "the higgs fields that are relevant for the mass matrices are given in table [ tab3 ] .",

    "the good news is that it can explain the patterns mentioned in sections [ sec : patterns ] and [ sec : syms ] , as we will show in this section .    at leading order ( lo ) in the number of flavons",
    ", we find mass matrices that can well produce the masses of the second and the third generation , while the first generation is massless . given that these particles are very light ,",
    "this is a satisfying first approximation .",
    "the fermion mixing matrices ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) however , do not fit the data well : the ckm matrix is the unity matrix , while the pmns matrix is the so - called bimaximal mixing matrix .",
    "the bimaximal mixing matrix has both a maximal atmospheric angle and a maximal solar angle .",
    "this result is relatively fine in for the atmospheric angle , where the deviation seems to be small ( at most of order @xmath1 ) , while a correction of order @xmath47 is needed for the solar angle . by definition",
    ", we also need a correction of size @xmath47 to introduce the cabibbo angle in the ckm matrix .",
    "fortunately , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections are tailored to be exactly of that order and these can indeed be such that the @xmath68 angles of in both the quark and lepton sector are corrected , while the @xmath69 angles only receive next - to - next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "the quark - lepton complementarity of section [ sec : patterns ] is reproduced : the quark and lepton angles add in both cases to a maximal angle .",
    "it turns out that the last mixing angle @xmath70 is relatively large in the neutrino sector ( giving an reactor mixing angle of order @xmath47 ) , while it is indeed tiny @xmath71 in the quark sector .    in a pati - salam context furthermore , the matrices of downquarks and charged leptons are connected , as they both particles are in the same pati - salam representations .",
    "this allows the bottom - tau unification and the georgi - jarlskog relations and it helps in connecting the nlo corrections of quark and lepton mixing .",

    "above , it was already mentioned that we predict the third neutrino mixing angle to be relatively large ( of the order of the cabibbo angle ) . for almost all points in parameter space ,",
    "the reactor mixing angle should be measureable by next generation experiments such as daya bay or double chooz .",
    "a second prediction is that the quasi - degenerate hierarchy is favoured in most of parameter space .",
    "also the normal and inverted hierarchy are possible , albeit only for slightly unnatural values of the parameters .",
    "however , we will see that this prediction is severely affected by `` interference '' effects between the two types of symmetries that are analysed in the next section .",
    "the positive results of the previous section are somewhat overshadowed by the fact that the combination of the flavour and the gut symmetry leads to extra effects , which are less appealing .",
    "these appear at three points : the higgs sector and the gauge and yukawa renormalization group behaviour .",
    "the first point is the higgs sector , which is very non - minimal in our model .",
    "a minimal pati - salam model can have only four higgs fields .",
    "these are labeled `` minimal '' in table 4 .",
    "other higgs fields only occur in more extended versions of pati - salam models .",
    "examples are the @xmath59 that features in the type ii seesaw and @xmath58 that couples to some particles of the second generation and as such generates the georgi - jarlskog relation and the stronger suppression of the charm quark .",
    "our construction features even more fields , which is due to the extra @xmath35 symmetry that forces to double some fields and to the fact that some higgs fields need to have vev structures that require the presence of extra fields .",
