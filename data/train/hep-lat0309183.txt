    "the pion , being the lightest and simplest particle in the hadronic spectrum has been studied intensively in the past . using a variety of effective and phenemenological models",
    ", the properties of the pion have been desribed with varying succes .",
    "however , these models make assumptions , for example , confinement is put in by hand in contrast to being the result of the underlying dynamics .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) does nt have this drawback since it is solves qcd directly .",
    "using lqcd , global properties of the pion such as the mass and the decay width have been calculated to satisfying accuracy .",
    "the form factor , which directly reflects the internal structure , is clearly an important challenge .",
    "the first lattice results were obtained by martinelli and sachrajda @xcite .",
    "it was followed by a more detailed study by draper _",
    "@xcite , who showed that the form factor could be described by a simple monopole form as suggested by vector meson dominance @xcite .",
    "we extend @xcite these studies by adopting improved lattice techniques @xcite , which means that we include extra operators in order to systematically eliminate all the @xmath2 discretisation errors .",
    "some aspects of the pion structure have been obtained @xcite using the bethe - salpeter method. we also use this approach and compare its predictions to the results of our direct calculation of the pion form factor .    finally we study a chiral extrapolation to reach the physical limit .",
    "to extract the form factor we calculate the two- and three point functions of the pion , analogously to @xcite .",
    "the two point function is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an operator creating a state with the quantum numbers of the pion . by varying the interquark distance at the sink , @xmath5",
    ", we can improve the overlap with the physical pion and obtain information on the bethe - salpeter amplitudes. the three point function is calculated as @xmath6 with @xmath7 the fourth component of the current , inserted at time @xmath8 . since the local current @xmath9 is not conserved on the lattice , one can construct the noether current belonging to our action @xmath10 this current however , still has @xmath2 corrections for @xmath11 .",
    "a conserved and improved current can be constructed @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 the bare - quark mass is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the kappa value in the chiral limit and @xmath16 denotes the lattice spacing . for our simulation , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "comparison of the currents will give us information on the importance of improvement .",
    "on a @xmath18 lattice , we generated @xmath19 quenched gluon configurations at @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , we calculated non - perturbatively improved ( @xmath21 @xcite ) quark propagators for 5 different values of the hopping parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "these propagators were then combined to two- and three point functions for the pion with masses ranging from 360 to 970 mev .",
    "is taken from @xcite . ] for the improved current , we use the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 as determined by bhattacharya _",
    "_ @xcite . to extract the significant parameters from our numerical data ,",
    "we use the following parametrisations . for the two point function",
    ", we have @xmath26 including the contribution of the ground state ( n=0 ) and a first excited one ( n=1 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 denote the matrix elements , @xmath28 and are related to the bethe - salpeter amplitude , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energies of ground and excited state , respectively ; @xmath32 denotes the interquark distance .",
    "the three - point function is parametrised as @xmath33 the production of pion pairs , wrap around effects being due to the propagation of states beyond @xmath5 and an elastic contribution from the excited state were ignored in our parametrisation after being estimated negligable .",
    "all parameters in the two- and three - point functions - energies @xmath34 , @xmath35-factors and the form factor @xmath36 - were fit simultaneously to the data per configuration .",
    "for the three - point function , we let the current insertion time @xmath8 vary from @xmath37 to @xmath5 .",
    "the value for the parameters and their error in these simultaneous fits are obtained through a single elimination jackknife procedure .",
    "as a byproduct of our simulations we also obtain pion masses for the 5 different @xmath22-values .",
    "they agree with the literature .",
    "we also checked the energie - momentum relation and up to the energies involved we found that a continuum relation provides the best description .",
    "these non - trivial tests indicate that our simulations are done correctly .    using the different currents",
    ", we extract the form factor for our five @xmath22-values .",
    "comparison of the results for the noether current and the improved current yields that the effect of improvement can be as large as 25@xmath38 for the highest momenta considered .",
    "the improved results are shown in fig.[fig : ff_vmd ] .",
    "for the five pion masses .",
    "curves : monopole fits to the data._,height=302 ]    the high accuracy for the datapoint at @xmath39 is due to the fact that we satisfy the ward - takahashi identity to 1 ppm .    as in the previous study @xcite of the pion form factor",
    "we compare our results to a monopole form factor @xmath40 which is suggested by the vector meson dominance ansatz . fitting our data to this model",
    ", we extract a vector meson mass which is within 5@xmath38 of the corresponding rho mass on the lattice @xcite . from the behaviour of the form factor at low @xmath41",
    ", we can extract the mean - square charge radius of the pion , @xmath42 where in the last step we assume eq .",
    "[ eq : vmd ] and use the fitted parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] as a function of the pion mass .",
    "previously , the bethe - salpeter - amplitude @xmath44 has been used to obtain estimates of the charge radius , @xmath45 the results based on this procedure are also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rms ] . as can be seen these values",
    "are much lower than the actual values obtained from the form factor",
    ". moreover , the bethe - salpeter results are almost mass independent , in accordance with the observations of refs .",
    "this is a known@xcite deficit of the approach , which fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] makes quantitative .",
    "we extrapolate our results obtained with eq .",
    "[ eq : rms_ff ] using three different parametrisations .",
    "first , we try chiral perturbation theorie ( @xmath46pt ) . at one - loop order the prediction for the radius @xcite is @xmath47 in quenched @xmath46pt",
    "the rms is constant to this order .",
    "there are however indications that a mass dependence appears at higher order @xcite . for our masses",
    "we restrict ourselves to a term linear in @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "lastly , we have also used the vmd prescription and assume a linear dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath48 .",
