    "lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of both general relativity and the standard model of particle physics , and as such has been the subject of many experimental investigations over the past century .",
    "much of this work has focused upon the properties and propagation of light in different reference frames , beginning with the pioneering work of michelson - morley  @xcite , kennedy - thorndike  @xcite , and ives - stilwell  @xcite . the purpose and interpretation of these experiments",
    "has varied with the development of physical theories throughout the century , ranging from attempts to observe the properties of a luminiferous aether , to determining whether space - time exhibits lorentz as opposed to some other symmetry , and to more recent searches for the imprint of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "these most recent studies presume that physics is invariant under `` passive '' transformations of the observer reference frame , while leaving open the possibility that the theory is not lorentz invariant under `` active '' boosts of the rest frame of the system under test .",
    "this could happen if known particles interact with fields not accounted for by the standard model , or indeed if lorentz symmetry turns out to be explicitly broken . in this context ,",
    "modern implementations of michelson - morley , kennedy - thorndike , and ives - stilwell tests  @xcite are used to look for evidence of such lorentz violation in the form of modifications of the dispersion relation for light and other standard model particles . in particular , these tests search for deviations of the phase velocity of light in vacuum from the canonical value .",
    "these deviations can be orientation- and also polarization - dependent , and in general give the vacuum the properties of a potentially birefringent or anisotropic polarizable medium",
    ". such effects can be parameterized by the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite , which provides an effective field theory framework for determining the experimental consequences of a perturbative lorentz violation .",
    "observation of lorentz violation in a physical system would provide clues about the structure of physics at experimentally inaccessible energy scales .",
    "modern michelson - morley experiments usually consist of a pair of orthogonally mounted electromagnetic resonators that are rotated in order to modulate their orientation in space .",
    "the observable is the difference in their resonant frequencies ; lorentz violations will manifest as periodic variations in the signal at frequencies related to the rotation and its harmonics .",
    "hence , such experiments are typically considered to be sensitive only to anisotropies in the speed of light . here , we extend the analysis of  @xcite to explicitly derive the sensitivity of michelson - morley tests to deviations in the speed of light that are isotropic in a given inertial reference frame . furthermore , using this result we report upon a new analysis of data from a recent experiment  @xcite that constrains all nine non - birefringent cpt - even photon - sector sme coefficients , summarized in table [ tab : results ] . in particular , our analysis constrains the isotropic shift parameter @xmath3 , the first such result from this form of experiment .",
    "although this constraint is overshadowed by recent results based on collider physics  @xcite , it is an improvement upon results obtained from experiments intended to constrain @xmath4 such as relativistic ion spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    ".fitted values and uncertainties of the non - birefringent photon - sector parameters of the sme for the results reported here .",

[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , > \" , ]     [ tab : coef ]    although the general form of the time - dependence of the earthbound lab - frame @xmath10 s can be derived using the observer covariance of the action , the terms contributing to proportional to the value of @xmath4 in the sun - centered celestial equatorial frame ( sccef ) can be obtained using simpler arguments .",
    "the resonator in a michelson - morley experiment is sensitive only to anisotropies that the sccef @xmath4 generates in the laboratory frame , which in turn must depend solely upon the orientation of the lab with respect to the lab s boost relative to the sccef .",
    "the maximum difference signal is generated when the axis of one resonator is most parallel to the boost from the sccef , while the axis of the other is as nearly perpendicular to the boost as possible .",
    "in general , this will happen twice per solar day , although the precise times that they occur will vary over the course of a year .",
    "for example , an experiment with one cavity axis aligned east to west in the lab sees a peak daily @xmath4-induced shift in that cavity maximized during the summer and winter solstices , while its peak shift is minimized at the equinoxes .    since the frequency shift between two identical resonators given by eq .",
    "is the same up to a constant factor for any such pair  @xcite , we can analyze the simple case of a pair of fabry - perot cavities aligned orthogonally to one another along the @xmath11- and @xmath12-axes .",
    "the resonance frequencies of each of the cavities are then @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length of the cavity , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the average phase velocity of light moving back and forth along the cavities axes .",
    "variations in the phase velocity of light along the cavity axes yields the frequency difference @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the shift in the vacuum phase velocity of light parallel ( @xmath19 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath20 ) to the @xmath21-axis due to @xmath10 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the problem now reduces to finding the mean speed of light along the laboratory @xmath11- and @xmath12-axes in terms of @xmath4 in the sccef .",
    "observer lorentz covariance of the sme implies that the overall lagrangian remains a lorentz scalar , although the action may not be term - by - term lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "this means that although the speed of light might be frame - dependent , the velocity of a particular electromagnetic wave must transform in the same manner as any other velocity under lorentz boosts i.e .",
    "according to the relativistic velocity addition formula .",
    "given the boost of the laboratory relative to the sccef , we can then determine the anisotropic shift in the speed of light as seen in the laboratory arising from an isotropic shift ( nonzero @xmath4 ) in the sccef .",
    "we seek a solution that is leading order in the @xmath10 s , and so the laboratory anisotropies induced by a nonzero @xmath4 in the sccef can depend only upon @xmath4 .",
    "to second order in the laboratory boost @xmath22 relative to the sccef , we then obtain @xmath23 and similarly for the mean speed of light along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "more details of this derivation can be found in appendix [ app : relveladd ] .",
    "the differential signal produced by a pair of orthogonally mounted resonators must then be given by @xmath24    for an experiment which rotates about the laboratory @xmath25-axis with angular frequency @xmath26 , we find that the variation of the lorentz - violating frequency shift in time is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28,\\label{eq : s}\\\\ c(t)&=({\\tilde{\\kappa}_{\\rm tr}})\\times\\sum_{i}\\big[c_{s , i}\\sin(\\omega_{i}t)+c_{c , i}\\cos(\\omega_{i}t)\\big].\\label{eq : c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the overall modulation of the signal by @xmath29 follows from the fact that is unchanged when we exchange @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the remaining modulation frequencies @xmath32 are various harmonics of and beats between the frequencies of the sidereal day @xmath33 and the sidereal year @xmath34 , as derived in the appendicies .",
    "the weights @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 most relevant to @xmath4 are summarized in table [ tab : coef ] .",
    "the bounds presented here arise out of a new analysis of data from an experiment performed at the university of western australia @xcite .",
    "this experiment searched for lorentz violating signals by monitoring the difference frequency between two microwave cryogenic sapphire oscillators ( csos ) as a function of orientation and time .",
    "the details of this experiment and the operation of csos in general has been reported elsewhere @xcite , so we will provide only a brief description here .",
    "each cso relies upon a high q - factor ( @xmath39 ) sapphire loaded cylindrical resonant cavity , excited in the @xmath40 whispering gallery mode at approximately 10 ghz by a pound stabilized loop oscillator circuit . the two resonators are mounted one above the other with their cylindrical axes orthogonal in the horizontal plane .",
    "the experiment was continuously rotated in the laboratory with a period of 18 seconds .",
    "when resonantly excited , the sapphire crystals support standing waves with the dominant electric and magnetic fields pointing in the axial and radial directions respectively . for such whispering gallery modes",
    ", the poynting vector is directed around the crystal circumference . the resonant frequency of each crystal is directly proportional to the integrated phase velocity of light along the closed path followed by the resonant mode , and is thus sensitive to lorentz violation in the photon sector of the sme .",
    "note that in this experiment a significant fraction of the mode field exists in the sapphire crystal , therefore the resonance frequency could also be perturbed by lorentz violation in the electron sector .",
    "however , the relevant sme parameters for electrons have been constrained by other experiments @xcite to the degree that they do not make significant contributions to these results , so we assume that electrons are fully lorentz - symmetric .     +    data",
    "was collected from this experiment over a period of 400 days , with a useful duty cycle of 30@xmath41 .",
    "the data analysis is complicated by three main issues , each of which are addressed using specific techniques that in turn constitute the 3 steps of our analysis process .",
    "the first is the size of the data set .",
    "processing the entire data set simultaneously is computationally intensive , so the data is initially reduced using the same technique described in @xcite .",
    "the data is demodulated in quadrature at twice the frequency of the experiment rotation over an integer number of cavity rotation periods , @xmath42 , generating a reduced demodulated data set consisting of s(t@xmath43 ) and c(t@xmath43 ) coefficients of equations and , centered at the mean time of the demodulated data block , t@xmath43 .",
    "this reduces the size of the data set by @xmath44 ( 12 measurements during each of the @xmath42 rotations ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rawdat_a ] shows a typical subset of the data acquired continuously over 6 days , demodulated in blocks of 50 periods .",
    "in addition to reducing the size of the data , demodulation also effectively filters noise . in the final analysis for the results presented here we chose to use 500 periods , which maximizes the signal to noise ratio of the data while satisfying the nyquist sampling rate ( providing more than 2 data points per half day ) .",
    "the second main issue is the presence of jumps in the data , which are due to non - stationary noise sources such as sudden stress release in the resonator @xcite .",
    "when analyzing the data using standard regression techniques , such as least squares , these jumps mimic temporal signals resulting in incorrect parameter estimates .",
    "one solution to this problem is to remove short sections of data containing these jumps , identified using an unbiased method , albeit at the cost of reducing the useful duty cycle of the experiment . in this work we employed an alternative approach of taking the derivative of the data , which involves differencing successive data points  @xcite .",
    "signal jumps manifest in the derivative as singular outliers ( illustrated in figure [ fig : rawdat_b ] ) to which the least squares analysis is less susceptible .",
    "this is preferable since no data is excluded , the signal to noise is maximised , and no bias is applied to the data . for nonzero",
    "@xmath10 s , the derivative of the data will vary according to the derivative of and : @xmath45,\\label{eq : ds}\\ ] ] @xmath46.\\label{eq : dc}\\ ] ]    the third and final step of the analysis is to fit the frequencies of interest to the data using least squares regression .",
    "ordinary least squares ( ols ) regression assumes that the power spectral density ( psd ) of the residuals is white .",
    "figure [ fig : psd ] shows the psd of the data following demodulation over 2 periods of rotation ( increasing the number of rotations over which the data is averaged truncates the psd curves , acting as a low pass filter ) . for frequency offsets above @xmath47 hz",
    "the noise is white ; near the frequencies of interest , @xmath33 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 hz ) , however , a power law with @xmath50 describes the power spectral density .",
    "similarly , once differentiated , the psd exhibits a power law with @xmath51 , which is then used in the third part of this analysis . to account for the noise color of the data we use a weighted least squares ( wls ) technique that whitens the noise by pre - multiplying the data and the fit model with a weighting matrix .",
    "the weighting matrix is determined using a fractional differencing technique @xcite that corrects for serially correlated noise , as determined from @xmath52 .",
    "different frequencies are used to set limits on @xmath4 and the @xmath5 and @xmath7 components , allowing a simultaneously fit of all nine components using the coefficients in table [ tab : coef ] and the others already derived in @xcite .",
    "using a more sophisticated analysis of data collected in  @xcite , we have tightened the limits set by this experiment on the magnitude of all the non - birefringent @xmath10 coefficients of the sme by a factor between 1.5 and 4 , as summarized in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that michelson - morley experiments are sensitive to isotropic shifts in the vacuum speed of light , and thus for the first time , we report a simultaneous set of bounds on all nine of the non - birefringent @xmath10 coefficients . the new limit on @xmath4 is an improvement of more than a factor of 11 over limits obtained by relativistic ion spectroscopy  @xcite , marking the first time that a low energy experiment has been able to surpass the sensitivity of such tests .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation and the australian research council .",
    "we thank alan kostelecky for encouragement and useful discussions .",
    "consider a beam of light moving with velocity @xmath53 along the @xmath11-axis in the laboratory , which itself moves with velocity @xmath54 relative to the sccef , and define @xmath55 the velocity @xmath56 of that beam of light as measured in the sccef must be @xmath57 since we are interested solely in the contribution of the sccef @xmath4 to our experiment , and not in terms proportional to products of the @xmath10 s , we may assume @xmath58 and @xmath59 are such that the speed of light in the sccef is isotropic and equal to @xmath60 .",

    "the time @xmath78 is not the same as @xmath70 , and represents the time as measured in the sccef since that frame s @xmath79-axis coincided with the laboratory @xmath12-axis  @xcite .",
    "we can account for the active rotation of the experiment  @xcite by redefining @xmath71 so as to be aligned with the resonator axes : @xmath80 insertion of @xmath67 into yields modulations with the form of eq .  ,",
    "described in part [ sec : sens ] .",
    "this appendix presents the general form of transformations of the non - birefringent @xmath10 coefficients under an arbitrary boost @xmath67 from one inertial frame ( @xmath81 ) to another ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this derivation rests upon the assumption of lorentz invariance under observer transformations : that the lagrangian is an overall lorentz scalar quantity . in what follows",
    ", we neglect the contribution of sme coefficients which give rise to vacuum birefringence , as these have been constrained to be of order @xmath83 or less  @xcite , and do not contribute to the non - birefringent physics at leading order  @xcite . with this assumption in hand , we may begin with the lagrangian of eq .  ,",
