    "today we face many fundamental questions , some of which are driven by experimental data , such as the question about the mechanism of electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking , the nature of dark matter , and the physics associated with the vacuum energy , as well as questions that are driven by theoretical curiosity and ambition , which are in essence propelled by our hope that there is an elegant structure behind what we observe in nature .",
    "questions of the latter type include why there are three generations , what causes the hierarchy of fermion masses and mixing , and how the strong cp problem is resolved . while questions of the first type do have a definite answer , this is not necessarily the case for the questions of the second type . from this point of view",
    ", some of these questions might not even be the right ones to ask . with the start of the lhc",
    "we feel that we are at a verge of big changes , the depth of which we can not assess yet .",
    "indeed , the lhc marks the start of a long research program and experiments at the lhc are expected to revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental forces and matter .",
    "the lhc will definitely explore the origin of mass and the associated nature of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "in the course of this , it might also shed light on the nature of dark matter and the origin of the matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "it may also explore the physics that underlies the evolution of the early universe . while it is clear that the lhc will not answer all the fundamental questions that we have , the questions we ask now will most likely change after the lhc era .",
    "it is therefore really a great and unique time to be a particle physicist .    since the beginning of",
    "its run in 2010 , the lhc has been remarkable successful .",
    "atlas and cms collected around 45 pb@xmath0 in 2010 , more than 1 fb@xmath0 by the time of summer conferences , and more than 5 fb@xmath0 by the end of the year . at the end of the 2011 run , almost every week",
    "has set a new record in instantaneous luminosity . with the 2010 and early 2011 data , remarkably , all major standard model ( sm ) processes have already been re - established , including single - top and di - boson production , challenging measurements ( because of the small / large cross - sections / backgrounds ) that have been performed at the tevatron only in recent years . by now",
    ", we have entered a new territory in the search of physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) with sensitivities already well exceeding those of lep and the tevatron .    one important question then concerns the role of qcd for lhc measurements and new - physics searches . understanding how",
    "qcd works is essential in order to make accurate predictions for both the signal and background processes .",
    "this typically requires complex calculations to higher orders in the perturbative expansion of the coupling constant .",
    "understanding qcd dynamics can however also help reduce backgrounds and sharpen the structure of the signal .",
    "this can for instance be achieved by designing better observables , by employing appropriate jet algorithms , by using jet - substructure , or by exploiting properties of boosted kinematics .",
    "finally , once discovery is made , qcd will be crucial to extract the properties ( masses , spins , and couplings ) of the new states found . therefore , at the lhc , no matter what physics you do",
    ", qcd will be part of your life .     plus dijet events as measured by cdf .",

    "figures taken from  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is interesting to first recall a recent measurement that was the origin of considerable excitement . in april 2011 ,",
    "cdf reported the observation of a peak in the @xmath1 distribution in @xmath4 + dijet events  @xcite , see fig  [ fig : wjj ] .",
    "the first measurement had a @xmath5 significance , and was based on @xmath6 fb@xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , more data ( @xmath7 fb@xmath0 ) has been analyzed , leading to a significance of more than @xmath8  @xcite . since then , a large number of tentative new - physics explanations appeared on the arxiv , along with a few sm analyses that address the question of whether this effect can be attributed to a mismodelling of one of the sm backgrounds ( in particular single top )  @xcite .",
    "the excitement was curbed few months afterwards , when in june , d0 announced that it did not confirm the excess seen by cdf  @xcite .",
    "it is yet unclear what the reasons for the discrepancy between cdf and d0 findings are , if any .",
    "however , this example demonstrates that even in the case where one identifies a mass peak in the tail of a distribution ( a scenario that was considered `` an easy discovery '' ) a robust control of sm backgrounds remains mandatory , in particular when the shape of the backgrounds is one of the issues .",
    "currently we have a number of other recent measurements at collider experiments that report a few sigma deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "this is for instance the case for the top forward - backward asymmetry measured by both cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite , for the dimuon charge asymmetry measured by d0  @xcite , for @xmath9 measured by d0  @xcite , cp violation in time - integrated @xmath10 decays  @xcite , and a few more .",
    "the important question becomes then what the tools at our disposal are to make precise predictions , and whether we have the solid control of signal and background processes that is needed in order to claim discoveries .",
    "in this write - up i will discuss the status of our theoretical knowledge of most important sm processes , the tools at our disposal to describe these processes , and the impact of qcd higher orders in view of recent tevatron / lhc results .",
    "finally , i will discuss a few recent ideas to further improve on the way we perform technically challenging calculations .",
    "the range of physics analyses that one can do at the lhc is very broad .",
    "it includes pure instrumental qcd studies , such as measurements of parton densities and inclusive jet cross - section measurements , precision ew measurements , higgs searches , direct and indirect bsm searches , @xmath11 physics , top physics , diffractive studies and forward physics , and heavy ion physics .",
    "each of these topics includes a vast number of measurements and studies . yet",
    ", there are three things that everybody involved in any of these analyses can not live without .",
    "these are monte carlos ( mcs ) , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and jets .",
    "the first thing one can not live without at the lhc are mc generators . apart from very few exceptions , every analysis at the lhc uses a mc program for the simulation of the signal process , for the backgrounds , for subtracting the underlying event and the non - perturbative contributions , and/or for efficiency studies and modeling of the detector response .",
    "the current level of sophistication is such that essentially not a single study relies on pythia / herwig alone .",
    "it is well understood that in multi - parton processes it is important to describe the multiple hard qcd radiation at least using exact matrix elements , employing for instance alpgen  @xcite , madgraph  @xcite , or sherpa  @xcite .",
    "since experimental studies rely heavily on all these leading - order ( lo ) tools , there is continuous progress in their development , and the herwig / pythia codes that we have today bear little resemblance to their original version of the 80s .",
    "in particular , in pythia 8.1  @xcite ( a c++ code ) there is a new fully interleaved @xmath12-ordered multi - parton interaction ( mpi ) , initial- and final state evolution ( the original mass - ordered evolution is not supported any longer ) , a richer mix of underlying event processes ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , dy ) , the possibility to select two hard interactions in the same event , an @xmath15-dependent proton size in the mpi framework , the full hadron  hadron machinery for diffractive systems , several new processes in and beyond the sm , and various other new features .",
    "herwig++  @xcite ( the current version is 2.5.2 ) has new next - to - leading order ( nlo ) matrix elements , including weak boson pair production , a colour reconnection model , diffractive processes , additional models of bsm physics , and new lo elements for hadron - hadron , lepton - lepton collisions , and photon - initiated processes .",
    "sherpa  @xcite ( version 1.3.1 ) has improved integration routines in comix , a simplified kinematics reconstruction algorithm of the parton shower ( ps ) , leading to numerically more stable simulations , hepmc output for nlo events and various other improvements / bug - fixes .",
    "madgraph  @xcite ( version 5 ) has a completely new diagram generation algorithm , which makes optimal use of model - independent information , has an efficient decay - chain package , and a new library for the colour calculations .",
    "some applications from aloha  @xcite , an automatic library of helicity amplitudes for feynamn diagram computations are also implemented .",
    "altogether , there is continuous , fast progress in various directions .",
    "so far , it is amazing how well these tools work , once the normalization is fixed using data .",
    "a very recent comparison of data with alpgen up to six jets ( a control region for bsm searches ) is shown as an illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig:6j ]  @xcite .",
    "yet , the devil is often in the detail ( i.e. in the @xmath16% effects that are opposite to expectations ) .",
    "for instance in general one expects matrix - element based mcs to work better than pure pss , but this is not always the case ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "altogether , these lo programs will undergo a real stress test in the coming years .",

    "theorists like to advertise nlo computations by using the reduction of scale uncertainties in the predictions as an argument , which is meant to reflect the reduction in the theoretical perturbative uncertainty .",
    "however , the strongest argument in support of nlo calculations is their past success in accurately describing lep and tevatron data . because of the importance of nlo corrections",
    ", an industrial effort has been devoted in the last years to these computations  @xcite .",
    "recent revolutionary ideas in the way nlo computations are performed include sewing together tree - level amplitudes to compute loop amplitudes ( using on - shell intermediate states , cuts , unitarity ideas ,  )",
    "@xcite , the opp algorithm , an algebraic way to extract coefficients of master integrals by evaluating the amplitudes at specific values of the loop momentum  @xcite , and @xmath17-dimensional unitarity , a practical numerical tool to evaluate full amplitudes , including the rational part , with unitarity ideas  @xcite . for a pedagogical review on unitarity methods see  @xcite . these methods led in the past 2 to 3 years to a number of 2 @xmath18 4 calculations at hadron colliders .",
    "these include @xmath19 jets  @xcite , @xmath20 jets  @xcite , @xmath21  @xcite , @xmath22  @xcite , @xmath23 + 2 jets  @xcite , @xmath24 + 2 jets  @xcite , @xmath25  @xcite , @xmath26 + 2 jets  @xcite , four jet production  @xcite , and a few other ones .",
    "feynman diagram methods have also been applied successfully to 2 @xmath27 4 calculations , this is for instance the case for quark - induced @xmath28  @xcite , @xmath29  @xcite , @xmath30  @xcite production , @xmath31+jet  @xcite , and a number of vector boson fusioon ( vbf ) processes which are available in the public code vbfnlo  @xcite .",
    "vbf processes have never been measured at the tevatron .",
    "first measurements of vbf @xmath4 or @xmath32 production at the lhc are therefore of particular interest .",
    "they also pave the way to measurements of vbf higgs production .",
    "note that only a few years ago , performing this type of calculation with feynman diagrams was considered an impossible task .",
    "a novel approach to nlo calculations , based on the results of  @xcite , promotes traditional tree algorithms to generators of loop - momentum polynomials , that are called open loops  @xcite .",
    "the excellent performance of the method has been demonstrated , open loops have therefore a potential to address a number of multi - particle processes at hadron colliders .",
    "another recent approach evaluates one - loop qcd amplitudes purely numerically  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm consists of subtraction terms , approximating the soft , collinear and ultraviolet divergences of one - loop amplitudes and a method to deform the integration contour for the loop integration into the complex space .",
    "the algorithm is formulated at the amplitude level and does not rely on feynman graphs .",
    "the power of this method has been demonstrated recently with the leading color nlo calculation of up to seven jets in @xmath33 collisions  @xcite .",

    "given that both feynman diagram and unitarity based methods allowed us to compute @xmath36 processes at nlo in qcd , it might be unclear where the revolution advocated in the heading of the subsection lies in .",
    "the revolution , i believe , is not yet in the applications that we see today , rather in the prospect for low - cost fully computer - automated nlo calculations even beyond @xmath36 in the near future .",
    "indeed , two @xmath37 processes have already been computed at nlo , namely @xmath4 + 4 jets  @xcite and @xmath32 + 4 jets  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : w4j ] illustrates in the case of @xmath38 jets the typical effect of including nlo corrections : one obtains a considerable reduction of the scale uncertainty , and , for some distributions , a change in shape .",
    "as far as the full automation is concerned , let me highlight three interesting approaches .",
    "the first one  @xcite is a method based on feynman diagrams , it uses the opp procedure for the virtual calculation , and the fks subtraction of divergences , together with clever and efficient procedures to deal with instabilities .",
    "more improvements and refinements are to be expected soon . at present",
    "there is no public code , instead the idea is to provide @xmath39-tuples .",
    "the second approach , helac-1loop  @xcite , is a program that evaluates numerically qcd virtual corrections to scattering amplitudes using the opp method .",
    "the public program is part of the helac - nlo framework that allows for a complete evaluation of qcd nlo corrections .",
    "gosam  @xcite is a third approach which aims at the full automated calculation of nlo corrections for multi - particle processes .",
    "the one - loop amplitudes are generated using feynman diagrams and are reduced using d - dimensional unitarity , a refined passarino - veltman style tensor reduction , or a combination of both .",
    "gosam can be used to calculate one - loop corrections to both qcd and electroweak theory , and model files for bsm theories can be also linked .",
    "an interface to programs calculating real radiation is included too .",
    "the flexibility of gosam has been demonstrated explicitly by considering various examples .",
    "while nlo predictions provide relatively accurate results for inclusive cross - sections , they do not furnish an exclusive description of the final state that can be compared with actual particles in the detectors , as mc programs do .",
    "it is therefore useful to combine the best features of both approaches .",
    "two public frameworks exist for this purpose , namely mc@nlo  @xcite and powheg  @xcite .",
    "these tools are almost 10 years old now , and since their conception a long list of processes has been implemented in both frameworks . in particular , recently the powheg box was released  @xcite , which is a general framework for implementing nlo calculations in shower mc programs according to the powheg method .",
    "the user only needs to provide a simple set of routines ( born , colour - correlated born , virtual , real , and phase space ) that are part of any nlo calculation .",

    "the powheg method has been used recently also for the description of other important processes , e.g. for the calculation of @xmath32 boson in association with a top anti - top pair at nlo accuracy including ps effects  @xcite .      in nlo+ps approaches only contributions with one additional jet , relative to the born contribution ,",
    "are computed accurately , while all other emissions are described only in the shower approximation .",
    "there are however situations in which one has important contributions from higher multiplicity final states ( e.g. because of new channels that open up that are enhanced by kinematical factors , gluon pdfs etc . ) .",
    "menlops  @xcite is a method to further improve on nlo+ps predictions with matrix elements involving more partons in the final state . for example , for @xmath4 production",
    "it includes , as in mc@nlo or powheg , @xmath4 production at nlo , the ps , but also @xmath62 jets using exact matrix elements .",
    "roughly speaking , it uses a jet - algorithm to define two different regimes , and then corrects the 1-jet fraction using exact matrix elements and the 2-jet fraction using the nlo @xmath63-factor .",
    "this achieves nlo quality accuracy for inclusive quantities but an improved sensitivity to hard radiation and multi - parton kinematic features .",
    "a further recent theoretical development is loopsim . if one considers the process @xmath64 jet , the three observables @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are identical at lo .",

    "a better perturbative control of the top - quark pair production cross - section is also important to further constrain gluon pdfs , to have an accurate extraction of the top mass from the cross - section , and to improve our perturbative control over the @xmath54 forward - backward asymmetry .",

    "one has however to bear in mind that @xmath54 production is a difficult measurement given the presence of neutrinos in the final state , the combinatorics in the reconstruction of the tops , and the limited statistics at the tevatron .",
    "nevertheless , various suggestions have been made recently to explain the asymmetry in terms of bsm physics , but all proposals face the problem that they have to preserve the good agreement with the symmetric @xmath54 observables , respect dijet bounds and/or must evade the stringent limits on like - sign top production .",

    "threshold corrections to the boson rapidity distribution are also known  @xcite , these higher order corrections stabilise the theoretical predictions under scale variations .",

    "most controversies have to do with how different sources of errors should be combined , others concern the question of how to assign / interpret the perturbative uncertainties .",
    "i will illustrate here just two of these issues .",
    "the soft logarithms appearing in cross - sections can be resummed using an effective theory approach .",
    "performing such a calculation requires an introduction of a matching scale , where the full and effective theory amplitudes must agree .",
    "it is well - known that choosing a time - like ( i.e. complex ) matching scale effectively resums @xmath108 enhanced terms . in  @xcite it",
    "is suggested that this procedure improves the convergence of the perturbative expansion significantly , and reduces the uncertainty of the perturbative ( nnlo ) prediction .",
    "this approach is criticized in  @xcite with the arguments that @xmath108 are just numbers , so that there is no formal limit in which they dominate , and that only one class of @xmath108 terms is resummed ( those that arise from the gluon form factor ) , but not all of them . in this context , one has to mention that perturbative qcd is often about pushing approximations beyond their formal limit of validity , and that a given approach should be judged by seeing how well it fares in practice .",

    "can also find a detailed discussion of why it is _ not _ appropriate to use the standard scale variation as an estimate of the perturbative uncertainty for the 0-jet bin cross - section ( fig.1 of  @xcite also shows that for a particular choice of @xmath114 one obtains a vanishing scale uncertainty band in the 0-jet bin ) .",

    "\\label{eq : sighiggs2}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sighiggs2 ] ) , it is evident that the scale uncertainty is smaller for the _ exclusive _ measurement with 0-jets , than the one of the fully _ inclusive _ measurement .",
    "to explain this feature , stewart and tackmann recall that there are two mechanisms at work in the 0-jet cross - section  @xcite : there is a large @xmath63-factor from perturbative higher orders , as well as large negative logarithms @xmath116 that become more important the smaller @xmath117 is .",
    "they therefore suggest that the error on the 0-jet bin should be computed taking into account a full correlation between jet - bins , i.e. the error from the 0-jet cross - section is computed from the relation @xmath118 .",
    "one obtains then simply @xmath119 . the effect of this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetveto ] . while this procedure is certainly more conservative than a conventional scale variation , it is clear that to reduce the uncertainty on the jet - veto cross - section",

    "both observables are however not the ones used in current higgs searches .",
    "furthermore the beam thrust has the drawback that it receives very large non - perturbative corrections , as can be easily seen by running a ps program once at parton and once at hadron level .",
    "the physics programme involving gauge bosons is particularly rich .",
    "the road towards precision measurements and searches starts from the measurement of inclusive @xmath4 and @xmath32 cross - sections , which , from a theoretical point of view , are the most precisely known processes at hadron colliders . beyond measurements of purely inclusive @xmath122 production cross - sections , it is possible to study the production of @xmath4 or @xmath32 bosons in association with one or more jets , and ratio of cross - sections .",
    "interesting ratios are for instance @xmath123 , with @xmath124 , that start at @xmath125 in the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant , or ratios of @xmath126 , that are of order @xmath127 . in both cases ,",

    "these distributions provide strong constraints on parton distribution functions and are useful probes of new physics .",

    "it is legitimate to start worrying about mixed qcd and ew corrections .",
    "qcd+ew interference is formally a higher - order effect , and exact results are not known currently .",
