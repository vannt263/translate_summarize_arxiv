    "the phenomenon was first discussed by cohen and fano @xcite to explain the observation of oscillations in the total photionization cross section of the h@xmath2 molecule as a function of the photon energy @xcite . according to their analysis , the interference pattern depends periodically on the ratio of the internuclear distance to the wavelength of the photoelectron and is superimposed on the quickly decreasing photoabsorption cross section . in recent years , young - type interferences",

    "furthermore , interference effects in the ionization of molecules by heavy ion @xcite and electron impact @xcite have been investigated .",
    "recently , the idea of cohen and fano was extended to the double photoionization of h@xmath2 @xcite , the photoionization of more complex molecules @xcite , and laser induced multiphoton ionization of molecules @xcite .    in photoionization of a diatomic molecule the double - slit interferences primarily depend on the momentum of the photoelectron , @xmath3 , the internuclear distance between the two atoms , @xmath4 , and the angle between the emission direction of the electron and the molecular axis . in past work , photoionization of molecules from the ground electronic state and corresponding interference patterns in the angular distributions of the photoelectron in the molecular body fixed frame was studied .",
    "even the small variations of the internuclear distance in the vibrational states of a bound molecule could be observed in the patterns @xcite .",

    "negative iodine molecules i@xmath5 were excited by a pump laser pulse to a dissociative state , in which the molecule fragments into a negative ion i@xmath6 and a neutral atom i @xcite . during the dissociation the molecule was ionized by a second pump laser pulse and the photoelectron spectra were measured .",

    "the protons first accelerate in the steep part of the molecular ion potential and then propagate with almost constant velocity .",
    "furthermore , the width of the nuclear wave packet increases as a function of internuclear distance due to dispersion . this requires to generate a well - confined nuclear wave packet in the excitation ( pump ) step in order to resolve the interferences in the ionization yields , as we will show below . in our simulations",
    ", we then modeled the interaction of the dissociating molecular ion with a second ultrashort probe laser pulse to determine the ionization probability as a function of the time delay between the dissociating and ionizing pulses . as we will show below , our results exhibit the expected young - type interferences .",

    "therefore , we can expect to be able to extract dynamical information about the nuclear wavepacket from such interference patterns in an experiment .",
    "we have studied double - slit like interferences in the photoionization yields of a dissociating hydrogen molecular ion via numerical simulations of the time - dependent schrdinger equation . to this end , we analyzed the different steps in a pump - probe scenario , in which h@xmath0 is excited by a pump pulse from the ground state to the first excited dissociative state and is then probed by a second time - delayed pulse , which ionizes the electron from the molecular ion as the ion dissociates .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations for a h@xmath0 model ion in its vibrational ground state show that the frequency of the pump pulse should be in resonance with the @xmath1 transition and should not be longer than about 5 fs in duration ( total pulse duration ) in order to generate a well confined nuclear wavepacket , which is a requirement to observe interference effects in the dissociating molecular ion ( as long as the internuclear distance of the protons at the moment of ionization is not observed ) .",
    "we have shown that the yields of ionization due to the interaction with a vuv probe pulse exhibit the expected double - slit interferences as a funtion of time delay between the two pulses .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillation are found to decrease with increase of the time delay due to the spreading of the wave packet . by developing an analytical model we were able to retrieve information about the nuclear wavepacket , namely its velocity , the mean value of the internuclear distance and the width of the wavepacket , from the oscillations in the ionization yields .",
    "we have tested the predictions of the analytical model against the results of numerical simulations and found a very satisfactory agreement .",
