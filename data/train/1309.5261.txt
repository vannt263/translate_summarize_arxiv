    "transit events have revolutionised our understanding of hot - jupiter exoplanets , thanks in large part to atmospheric studies using transmission , emission , and phase curve observations . even with hundreds of known transiting hot jupiters , currently only a small handful of exoplanets are capable of having their atmosphere characterised with all three types observations using current facilities , making these planets prototypes for the rest of the field . among these planets",
    "is wasp-12b , a prototype ` very hot jupiter ' which is one of the largest and hottest planets known @xcite .",
    "extensive ground and space - based observations have been conducted on this planet over the last few years .    as a very hot planet ,",
    "most models predict strong na , k , h@xmath5o , and tio / vo features in the atmosphere , with no condensates .",
    "wasp-12b has the potential to help address the stratospheric tio hypothesis , which links the presence of tio to thermal inversions @xcite .",
    "as one of the largest planets , studying its atmosphere could also help gain insight into the connection between the anomalously large radius and atmospheric features .",
    "despite all the recent observations , the nature and composition of wasp-12b s lower atmosphere remains largely elusive , as both ground and space - based transmission spectra have not yet been able to place strong constraints on the presence of specific molecular features or atmospheric constituents @xcite .",
    "spectral retrieval methods on the day - side emission spectrum indicated the planet contains a high c / o ratio @xcite , which would have important consequences regarding the planet s atmosphere @xcite . however , wasp-12a is now known to have a close m - dwarf stellar companion discovered by @xcite , which diluted previously reported transit and eclipse depths , especially in the infrared .",
    "after the diluting effects of the nearby m - dwarf have been taken into account , the dayside spectrum appears to largely resemble a black body @xcite , which weakens the case for a high c / o ratio atmosphere .",
    "here we present results from a large _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) programme for wasp-12b ( _ hst _ go-12473 ; p.i .",
    "sing ) , which is part of an eight planet optical atmospheric survey of transiting hot jupiters , with the initial results given in @xcite for wasp-19b and @xcite for hat - p-1b .",
    "the overall programme goals are to detect atmospheric features across a wide range of hot - jupiter atmospheres enabling comparative exoplanetology , detect stratosphere causing agents like tio @xcite , and detect hazes and clouds . in this paper , we present new _",
    "hst _ transit observations with the stis instrument ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) , and combine them with existing wfc3 ( wide field camera 3 ) spectra and _ spitzer _ photometry to construct a high signal - to - noise near - uv to infrared transmission spectrum , capable of detecting and scrutinising atmospheric constituents .",
    "we describe our observations in sect .",
    "2 , present the analysis of the transit light curves in sect .",
    "3 , discuss the results in sect . 4 and conclude in sect . 5",
    "we observed two transits of wasp-12b with the _ hst _ stis g430l grating during 14 march 2012 and 27 march 2012 , as well as one transit with the stis g750l during 4 september 2012 .",
    "the g430l and g750l datasets all consist of 53 spectra , each spanning five spacecraft orbits .",
    "the g430l grating covers the wavelength range from 2,900 to 5,700   , with a resolution r of @xmath6/@xmath75301,040 ( @xmath02 pixels ; 5.5   ) .",
    "the g750l grating covers the wavelength range from 5,240 to 10,270   , with a resolution r of @xmath6/@xmath75301,040 ( @xmath02 pixels ; 9.8   ) .",
    "both the g430l and g750l data were taken with a wide 52@xmath8 slit to minimise slit light losses .",
    "this observing technique has proven to produce high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra which are photometrically accurate near the poisson limit during a transit event ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "the three visits of _ hst _ were scheduled such that the third and fourth spacecraft orbits would contain the transit , providing good coverage between second and third contact , as well as an out - of - transit baseline time series before and after the transit .",
    "exposure times of 279 seconds were used in conjunction with a 128-pixel wide sub - array , which reduces the readout time between exposures to 21 seconds , providing a 93% overall duty cycle .",
    "the dataset was pipeline - reduced with the latest version of calstis and cleaned for cosmic ray detections with custom idl routines .",
    "cosmic rays typically affect @xmath9 of the ccd pixels in a typical 279 second exposure and the stsci pipeline is generally insufficient in cleaning the images .",
    "therefore , we adopted the strategy developed by @xcite to clean the images .",
    "the procedure is based on median - combining difference images to identify cosmic ray events , substituting the affected pixels , and those identified by calstis as `` bad '' , with flux values interpolated from the nearby point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the mid - time of each exposure was converted into bjd@xmath10 for use in the transit light curves @xcite .",
    "as the g750l grating suffers from fringing effects red - ward of @xmath07250 , we obtained contemporaneous fringe flats at the end of observing sequence , using them to defringe the science frame images ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral aperture extraction was done with iraf using a 13-pixel - wide aperture with no background subtraction , which minimises the out of transit standard deviation of the white light curves .",
    "the extracted spectra were then doppler - corrected to a common rest frame through cross - correlation , which removed sub - pixel wavelength shifts in the dispersion direction .",
    "the stis spectra were then used to create both a white - light photometric time series ( see fig . [ figwhite ] ) , and custom wavelength bands covering the spectra , integrating the appropriate wavelength flux from each exposure for different bandpasses .",
    "the resulting photometric light curves exhibit all the expected systematic instrumental effects taken during similar high s / n transit observations before _ hst _",
    "servicing mission 4 with stis , as first noted in @xcite .",
    "the main instrument - related systematic effect is primarily due to the well known thermal breathing of _ hst _ , which warms and cools the telescope during the 96 minute day / night orbital cycle , causing the focus to vary .",
    "previous observations have shown that once the telescope is slewed to a new pointing position , it takes approximately one spacecraft orbit to thermally relax , which compromises the photometric stability of the first orbit of each _ hst _ visit .",
    "in addition for stis , the first exposure of each spacecraft orbit has consistently been found to be significantly fainter than the remaining exposures .",
    "these trends are continued in our stis observations , and are both minimised in the analysis with proper _ hst _ visit scheduling .",
    "similar to other studies , in our subsequent analysis of the transit we discarded the first orbit of each visit ( purposely scheduled well before the transit event ) .",
    "in addition , we set the exposure time of the first exposure of each spacecraft orbit to be 1 second in duration , such that the exposure could be discarded without significant loss in observing time .",
    "we find that the second exposures taken for all five spacecraft orbits ( each 279 seconds in duration ) do not show the first - exposure systematic trend , making the short - exposure strategy an effective choice .",
    "however , we note that the first - exposure systematic in new observations of hd  189733 with the stis g430l ( go 1306 , p.i .",
    "pont ) , persisted despite discarding similar 1 second initial exposures . as the hd",
    "189733 time series exposures were much shorter ( 64 seconds ) , the 1-second strategy may only be effective for fainter targets like wasp-12 , which have longer exposure times .",
    "we also analyse the wfc3 g141 transit data of wasp-12 taken as part of go 12230 ( pi swain ) , with results given in @xcite .",
    "our re - analysis is motivated by both a need for a consistently derived transmission spectrum with the stis data , and the subsequent discovery of the m - dwarf companion @xcite which affects the transit and eclipse depths @xcite .",
    "we use the flt outputs from wfc3 s calwf3 pipeline . for each exposure calwf3",
    "conducts the following processes : bad pixel flagging , reference pixel subtraction , zero - read subtraction , dark current subtraction , non - linearity correction , flat - field correction , as well as gain and photometric calibration .",
    "the resultant images are in units of electrons per second .",
    "the first orbit of the wfc3 data was removed , as it also suffers from thermal breathing systematic effects like stis , leaving 391 exposures over the remaining four _ hst _ orbits , with a total of 175 exposures taken between first and fourth contact .",
    "the spectra were extracted using custom idl routines similar to iraf s apall procedure , using an aperture of @xmath119 pixels from the central row , determined by minimising the standard deviation across the aperture .",
    "the resulting 18 pixel wide aperture encompasses both wasp-12 and the m - dwarf binary .",
    "the aperture was traced around a computed centering profile , found to be consistent in the y - axis with an error of @xmath110.5 pixels .",
    "background subtraction was applied using a region above and below the spectrum for each exposure .",
    "we elected to subtract the m - dwarf flux contribution through post - processing , though we note that nearly identical results can be obtained by instead excluding the m - dwarf flux using psf fitting techniques @xcite . for wavelength calibration ,",
    "direct images were taken in the f132n narrow band filter at the beginning of the observations providing the absolute position of the target star .",
    "we assumed that all pixels in the same column have the same effective wavelength , with the extracted spectra covering the wavelength range of 1.077 to 1.704  @xmath12 m .",
    "we also observed wasp-12 from the ground with tennessee state university s automated celestron c-14 telescope , located at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the telescope was equipped with an sbig stl-1001e ccd camera observing through a cousins r filter .",
    "[ figure : monitor ] shows the cousins r data for the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 observing seasons plotted against heliocentric julian date .",
    "the observations have been corrected for bias , flat field , differential extinction , and pier - side offset .",
    "differential magnitudes are computed against the mean of 17 comparison stars in the same ccd field .",
    "each differential magnitude plotted is the mean of 8 to 10 successive frames on a given night .",
    "there are a total of 231 nightly observations , with transit points excluded from the plot .",
    "the standard deviation of an individual observation from the grand mean is 2.1 mmag .",
    "we find no significant periodicity between one hour and 200 days in these data , with wasp-12a appearing quite constant .",
    "in particular , a least - squares sine fit of the c14 observations phased with the radial velocity period has a peak - to - peak amplitude of only @xmath13 mag , indicating little , if any , contribution to the radial velocity variations from stellar - surface activity .",
    "the late f spectral type of wasp-12 and its relatively low measured @xmath14sin@xmath15 @xcite , also makes it unlikely to have significant star spots , which is confirmed by our photometric monitoring .",
    "alternatively , the low @xmath14sin@xmath15 could also be a result of a near pole - on view of the star as seen from the earth , which is consistent with the spin - orbit misalignment measurement from @xcite .",
    "our overall analysis methods are similar to the _ hst _ analysis of @xcite and @xcite , which we also describe briefly here .",
    "the light curves were modelled with the analytical transit models of @xcite .",
    "for the white - light curves , the central transit time , inclination , stellar density , planet - to - star radius contrast , stellar baseline flux , and instrument systematic trends were fit simultaneously , with flat priors assumed .",
    "the period was initially fixed to a literature value , before being updated , with our final fits adopting the value from section [ sec : ephemeris ] .",
    "both g430l transits were fit with a common inclination , stellar density and planet - to - star radius contrast .",
    "the results from the g430l and g750l white light curve fits were then used in conjunction with literature results to refine the orbital ephemeris and overall planetary system properties ( see section [ sec : jointfit ] ) . to account for the effects of limb - darkening on the transit light curve",
    ", we adopted the four parameter non - linear limb - darkening law , calculating the coefficients with atlas stellar models ( @xmath16=6500 , log  @xmath17=4.5 , [ fe / h]= 0.0 ) following .",
    "varying the stellar model within the known parameter range has a small effect on the output limb - darkening coefficients and fit transit parameters .",
    "in particular , we find changing the stellar effective temperature by @xmath11250  k shifts the radius ratios by @xmath01/3-@xmath18 .",
    "further , the shift is typically common to all wavelength channels , and the relative radius ratio differences are largely preserved ( to levels of @xmath00.1-@xmath18 in the case of wasp-12b ) .    as in many past stis studies , we applied orbit - to - orbit flux corrections by fitting for a fourth - order polynomial to the photometric time series , phased on the _ hst _ orbital period .",
    "the systematic trends were fit simultaneously with the transit parameters in the fit .",
    "higher - order polynomial fits were not statistically justified , based upon the bayesian information criteria ( bic ; @xcite ) .",
    "the baseline flux level of each visit was let free to vary in time linearly , described by two fit parameters .",
    "in addition , similar to the stis analysis of @xcite and @xcite , we found it justified by the bic to also linearly fit for two further systematic trends which correlated with the x and y detector positions of the spectra , as determined from a linear spectral trace in iraf , as well as the wavelength shift between spectral exposures , measured by cross - correlation .",
    "the errors on each datapoint were initially set to the pipeline values which is dominated by photon noise but also includes readout noise .",
    "the best - fit parameters were determined simultaneously with a levenberg - marquardt least - squares algorithm @xcite using the unbinned data .",
    "after the initial fits , the uncertainties for each data point were rescaled based on the standard deviation of the residuals and any measured systematic errors correlated in time ( ` red noise ' ) , thus taking into account any underestimated errors in the datapoints .",
    "the red noise was measured by checking whether the binned residuals followed a @xmath19 relation , when binning in time by @xmath20 points . in the presence of red noise",
    ", the variance can be modelled to follow a @xmath21 relation , where @xmath22 is the uncorrelated white noise component , and @xmath23 characterises the red noise @xcite .",
    "we find that the pipeline per - exposure errors are accurate at small wavelength bin sizes , which are dominated by photon noise , but are in general an underestimation at larger bin sizes .",
    "for the stis white light curves , we find @xmath24 for the g430l and @xmath25 for the g750l .",
    "a few deviant points from each light curve were cut at the 3-@xmath18 level in the residuals .",
    "the noise properties and systematics of wfc3 g141 spectra are becoming fairly well understood , and are mainly affected by the _ hst _ thermal - breathing variation ( note the similarities of figs .",
    "[ figwhite ] & [ figwhitewfc3 ] ) and detector persistence which causes a ramp - effect , also known as the ` hook ' @xcite .",
    "these trends are predominantly either common - mode ( i.e. the same in every wavelength channel across the detector ) or repeatable orbit - to - orbit , and thus straightforward to remove in a variety of ways without affecting the relative transit depths @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the ` hook ' has been studied as a function of exposure level , and reported in @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the effect is practically zero when the exposure level per frame is lower than 30,000 electrons / pixel , which is also well within the linear regime of the detector .",
    "as the maximum count rates for the wasp-12 wfc3 data are in the range of 38,000 electrons / pixel , thus not substantially higher than the nominal lower threshold , no obvious ` hook ' systematics are observed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we modelled the wfc3 white - light curve using the same analytic transit model and limb - darkening stellar model as used in the stis analysis . before the model fits",
    ", we subtracted the flux contribution from the m - dwarfs calculated from the wfc3 g141 response and the flux ratio as determined by @xcite , which matches well with our stis analysis of both the m - dwarf spectral type and flux normalisation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : mdwarf ] ) .",
    "we excluded the ends of the spectrum , where the response drops rapidly , extracting the region from 1.137 to 1.657 @xmath12 m to use for the white - light curve .    like in the stis analysis",
    ", the systematic effects of the thermal - breathing were modelled with a fourth order polynomial , phased on the _ hst _ orbital period , with the stellar baseline flux free to vary linearly in time .",
    "unlike @xcite we find that higher orders in _ hst _ orbital phase are required to more fully remove the systematic errors .",
    "an alternative method has been developed by @xcite to correct for detector systematics , which takes advantage of the repetitive nature .",
    "dubbed divide - oot , the procedure involves creating a template baseline - flux time - series for each subsequent exposure of an _ hst _ orbit , determined by averaging the out - of - transit exposures ( oot ) . the light curve for each of the _ hst _ orbits",
    "are then divided by the oot time - series , which removes the systematic error components which are common to each orbit .",
    "we find divide - oot gives very similar results as the parameterised method ( as wfc3 exhibits largely common - mode systematics ) , though shows somewhat higher levels of correlated noise , as there are _ hst _ orbital phase mismatches between the sub - exposures of the five _ hst _ orbits , leading to residual thermal breathing trends which are evident in the residuals .",
    "we adopt the parameterised method both because of the somewhat lower noise values ( @xmath26 , and it is more straightforward to budget for the affects of the dominant thermal - breathing systematic on the transit depths through the use of the covariance matrix ( or alternatively the mcmc posterior distribution ) . the m - dwarf flux contribution in the wfc3",
    "is @xmath27 , which translates to a systematic uncertainty on the radius ratio when subtracting the flux of 0.00018 @xmath28 , which is small compared to our final wfc3 white - light curve radius and uncertainly of 0.11977@xmath110.00042 @xmath28 .    in comparing our results to the literature ,",
    "a source of disagreement is the overall @xmath28 level , which we find significantly higher than @xcite , with our levels much closer to those of @xcite . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "this is a result of the exponential function with time which they used to model the instrument systematics , which effectively ` carves out ' the transit baseline flux leading to smaller fit radii .",
    "we see no evidence for a time - dependent exponential function ( see fig . [ figwhitewfc3 ] ) , with our raw wfc3 white light curve showing a closer resemblance to the stis g750l data and its thermal - breathing trends .",
    "but for the _ hst _ wfc3 transit.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we used the central transit times of our _ hst _ data along with the transit times of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to determine an updated transit ephemeris .",
    "when calculating transit ephemerides from data taken with different instruments in different wavelengths , it is important to use coherent and realistic estimates .",
    "pont et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed how correlated noise could dominate the error budget of system parameter measurements from transit photometry .",
    "this issue is especially important for ground - based photometry of wasp-12 , given that the m0 dwarf companions lie 1@xmath29 from the target star , making very high precision photometry more difficult in changing seeing conditions .",
    "as the uncertainties given by @xcite do not account for the effect of correlated noise , as a conservative estimate , we multiplied the error bars by a factor of three , found to be typical for ground - based photometry of transiting planets ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we fit the transit times listed in table [ table : ttimes ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : timing ] using a linear function of the period @xmath30 and transit epoch @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 we find a period of @xmath33 ( days ) and a mid - transit time of @xmath340.00031 ( bjd ) .",
    "a fit with a linear ephemeris is in general an unsatisfactory fit to the data , having a @xmath35 of 29 for 9 degrees of freedom ( @xmath36=3.2 ) , and transit timing variations ( ttvs ) have been claimed for this system .",
    "we tentatively attribute the high formal reduced @xmath35 to unaccounted red noise in the ground - based photometry , rather than actual transit timing variations .",
    "we proceed with the linear ephemeris given that our _ hst _ transit times are more consistent with a linear fit than a ttv , and the overall problems concerning the red - noise in photometry .",

    "potentially , rayleigh scattering could be produced by gaseous h@xmath5 , a possibility explored by for hd  209458b and @xcite when modelling the wasp-12b wfc3 emission and transmission spectra , though there are several problems with this potential interpretation .",
    "for one , a true planetary atmosphere is unlikely to be devoid of all atomic and molecular species , and there is evidence for substantial opacity from metals in the near - uv @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a pure h@xmath5 atmosphere would have a very high albedo , which is ruled out by the _ spitzer _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "sub - micron silicate condensates could also be a source of rayleigh scattering , as observed for the haze in hd  189733b @xcite . however , the main problem with h@xmath5 rayleigh slope interpretations on wasp-12b are the low implied temperatures ( 882@xmath11165 k ) which may not be feasible on this very hot planet , measured to have brightness temperatures near 3000 k. in contrast , the terminator temperatures implied by the rayleigh scattering slope for hd  189733b are perfectly consistent with day - side and phase curve measurements .",
    "it is possible the condensate scale height is smaller than that of the surrounding gas , which would flatten the resulting transmission spectra and could explain a low measured temperature for aerosols in the rayleigh scattering regime .",
    "solar system observations and brown dwarf models indicate condensate scale heights which are @xmath01/3 that of the local gas scale height @xcite , a possibility for hot - jupiter atmospheres as well @xcite . for wasp-12b , a rayleigh scattering condensate with a scale height 1/3@xmath38",
    "would imply temperatures 3@xmath39 higher than found otherwise , or 2646@xmath11165 k which is much closer to the expected terminator temperatures .",
    "however , we note that the rayleigh scattering signature on hd  189733b is fully consistent with a condensate scale height which is the same as the gas scale height . our best fit mie scattering aerosol models are indistinguishable in quality to rayleigh models , providing an excellent overall fit ( see table [ table : fits ] ) .",
    "unlike the rayleigh model , hotter temperature mie scattering models can fit the data equally well , which is likely necessary for wasp-12b ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : dustfigure ] ) .",
    "even with near - uv to ir wavelength coverage , the particle size - temperature degeneracy makes it difficult to confidently constrain the composition , since other aerosol materials with similar optical properties to corundum would also provide equally good fits .",
    "despite the strong degeneracy , we do find the particle sizes for all models are generally sub - micron in size regardless of temperature .    in principle",
    ", an aerosol could be the result of condensation chemistry , or alternatively the aerosol may be photochemical in nature @xcite . if the aerosol observed arrises from condensation chemistry , wasp-12b would have similarities with late m - dwarfs and brown dwarfs , both of which are thought to have significant dust in their photospheres .",
    "hydrocarbons in hot jupiters models have been explored in several studies including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies find that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation generally occurs at high altitudes on the ` cooler ' hot - jupiters , which could ultimately lead to the formation of a ` soot ' aerosol layer @xcite",
    ". such a soot layer would be difficult to produce in current models for wasp-12b , without invoking significant transport from the cooler night side or pole regions . in a model of hd  209458b",
    ", @xcite found that c@xmath40h@xmath41 compounds were lost either primarily by reactions with atomic hydrogen or by photolysis , and such process would likely be more efficient in the higher irradiated conditions of wasp-12b .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the chemical models currently invoked assume neutral chemistry , which is not particularly conducive for soot formation , even under ` cooler ' hd  189733b conditions , and it is possible that ion chemistry plays a role in the formation of complex species , an area which deserves further study .",
    "there are other indications of significant aerosols , namely from secondary eclipse and phase curve observations .",
    "the emission spectrum of wasp-12b resembles a black body from the optical to the ir @xcite .",
    "such a black body spectrum could be produced from an isothermal atmosphere , but could also be explained by clouds . for non - isothermal atmospheres ,",
    "more consistent with radiative equilibrium , an observed black body emission spectrum could naturally occur as a result of a cloud deck",
    ". the atmosphere could be optically thin at all wavelengths at low pressure above the cloud deck , but then at the pressure level of the cloud , the atmosphere may suddenly become optically thick , making the surface emit from the same altitudes and temperatures at all wavelengths .",
    "the _ spitzer _ phase curve measurements from @xcite also indicate a low heat recirculation efficiency and a modest bond albedo , estimated to be @xmath42=0.25@xmath43 . as many hot jupiters have very low albedos @xcite , the modest albedo of wasp-12b prompted @xcite to mention rayleigh scattering and/or reflective clouds as a possibility .",
    "though the errors on albedo are currently large , if confirmed an aerosol species like corundum could naturally produce such a modest albedo , as its optical properties make the material not overly scattering ( like mgsio@xmath37 or catio@xmath37 ) nor highly absorptive ( like fe@xmath5o@xmath37 ) .",
    "optical secondary eclipse measurements could play an important role in determining the overall pervasiveness of the aerosols , with a direct measurement of the wavelength - dependant albedo a further important constraint on the composition ( e.g. see @xcite for the case of hd189733b ) .",
    "for instance , a blue and red optical albedo measurement could help differentiate between a strong rayleigh scattering dust and tholins , which are preferentially red .",
    "aerosol species could also be useful in interpreting the observed low recirculation efficiency . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the first - order effect of clouds in hot jupiters",
    "is to move the contribution functions and effective photosphere at all wavelengths to higher altitudes and lower pressures . at lower pressures , the timescale of heat loss from the atmosphere will decrease ,",
    "thereby also decreasing the efficiency of the observed day - to - night heat redistribution .      to date",
    ", there has been no substantial evidence for tio present in the atmosphere for any hot jupiter , except for the possible bump in the absorption spectrum of hd  209458b between 6200a and @xmath07000  .",
    "_ hst _ transmission spectra now shows that tio is absent in the atmospheres of the very hot jupiters wasp-12b and wasp-19b @xcite .",
    "both planets also lack strong thermal inversions @xcite , which further indicates tio is not present in either planet at the necessary abundance levels to cause a stratosphere .",
    "there are four leading mechanisms to deplete tio from a hot jupiter atmosphere : a vertical - cold trap , a day / night cold trap , the effects of stellar activity and high c / o ratios @xcite .",
    "as wasp-19b orbits an active star , experiences a strong day / night contrast , and can also experience a vertical cold trap , it is not immediately clear what the dominant tio - depletion mechanism is for that planet , though a detection of h@xmath5o in the transmission spectrum of wasp-19b disfavours the high c / o scenario @xcite .",
    "wasp-12b is an ideal test case in many respects .",
    "wasp-12a is inactive ( see section [ section : activity ] ) , making the activity scenario unlikely .",
    "further , while most hot jupiters can experience a vertical cold - trap , which would deplete tio at depth , wasp-12b is hot enough such that it should not experience a cold - trap anywhere throughout its dayside atmosphere @xcite . finally , sensitive non - detections of both tio and tih points towards a general lack of ti - bearing molecules in the broadband spectrum , irrespective of the c / o ratio .",
    "very hot jupiters , with equilibrium temperatures greater than 2400 k , are observed to have low circulation efficiencies which leads to very large day / night temperature contrasts @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of redistribution is primarily governed by the ratio of advective to radiative timescales , with hotter planets tend to have shorter radiative timescales and thus larger day / night contrasts .",
    "night - side temperatures cool enough for species such as ti to be condensed into solids could lead to rain out , which would then drastically deplete the species from the atmosphere .",
    "@xcite has explored how a strong day / night temperature contrast can lead to depletion of tio through the use of 3d modelling . in their models",
    ", they found that large - scale circulation patterns can produce strong vertical mixing that can keep condensable species lofted , as long as they are trapped in particles of sizes of a few microns or less on the night side .",
    "of note , our transmission spectrum is consistent with sub - micron size particles .",
    "thus , while it is not entirely clear if the aerosols at the terminator originate from condensation chemistry , in any case , the day / night cold - trap would appear to be the leading explanation for the lack of tio .",

    "/ n broadband observations reaching into the near - uv , we are able to decisively rule out prominent absorption by tio in the exoplanet s atmosphere",
    ". given wasp-12b s unique properties , we find that the day / night cold trap is the leading explanation for the lack of the molecule . as other very hot jupiters",
    "also experience similarly strong day / night contrasts , it is likely that few ( if any ) hot jupiters will show strong tio absorption features .",
    "we find a transmission spectrum which lacks any strong broadband molecular or atomic absorption signatures , though it does have a significant slope indicative of scattering by aerosols .",
    "this is the first direct indication for the presence of aerosols on a very hot jupiter .",
    "in addition to the transmission spectrum , significant aerosols throughout the entire atmosphere can also help explain the black body nature of the emission spectrum , as well as the modestly bright albedo .",
    "an aerosol species on wasp-12b could originate from a high temperature condense analogous to the dusts on brown dwarfs and m - dwarfs , or alternatively the aerosols could be hydrocarbons which are photochemical in nature .    to date , only the much cooler planet hd  189733b has strong evidence for aerosol species in the atmosphere of a hot jupiter .",
    "the results here for the much hotter planet wasp-12b indicate that the aerosol species can potentially be an important feature for planets across the entire wide range of hot jupiter planets .",
