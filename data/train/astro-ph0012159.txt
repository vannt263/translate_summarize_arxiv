    "\\1 ) in our vlba observations of seyfert galaxies at frequencies between 1.6  ghz and 15 ghz we have found sub - relativistic jet component speeds ( typically @xmath0 ) in several seyfert galaxies , such as in mrk 348 at a distance of 0.5 pc from the core , in mrk  231 at 1.0 pc ( ulvestad et al .",
    "1999 ) , in ngc 5506 at 3.4  pc ( roy et al . in prep ) , and in ngc  1068 at 21  pc ( fig 1 ; roy et al . in prep ) .",
    "in contrast , in more powerful radio sources such as qsos , the jet speeds have usually proven to be relativistic .",
    "the difference could signify either an intrinsic difference between the engines or a deceleration of the flow in seyfert galaxies in the blr gas on scales @xmath1 pc .",
    "( note though that if the seyfert components are shocks , then their speeds would be different from the jet flow speed . )",
    "\\2 ) we found one - sided jets in vlba images of the seyfert galaxies mrk  348 , mrk 231 , and ngc  5506 . in these galaxies",
    "the jets are low power and slow and probably lie across the line of sight ( ngc  5506 and mrk 348 host water masers , indicating edge - on systems , and in mrk 231 the jet is inclined at @xmath2 if it is perpendicular to the 100 pc scale hi disc ; carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) . in powerful radio",
    "jets the one - sidedness is usually explained with doppler boosting , but in these seyfert galaxies , boosting should be small , which leaves free - free absorption of the counterjet by a screen ( perhaps the torus ) as a more likely explanation .",
    "\\3 ) flat or absorbed spectra were found in some of the parsec - scale radio components in mrk 348 , mrk 231 , ngc  2639 , and ngc  5506 and we found that these could be caused by free - free absorption by a foreground screen .",
    "such absorption would be expected if the x - ray absorbing column seen in , say , mrk  348 ( 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 ) , occurred in a slab 0.1 pc thick like the expected inner torus edge ; and is enough to extinguish our view of a counter - jet .",
    "however , note that the @xmath5 values we measured are lower limits of @xmath6 k , and so @xmath5 could in principal be as high as @xmath7 k and then the spectra could be due to synchrotron self absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "in contrast , flat - spectrum cores seen in high - power jets are rarely attributed to free - free absorption and are usually explained as ssa .",
    "\\4 ) the jet in ngc 5506 bends through @xmath8 at 3.4 pc to align with the large - scale outflow , and in mrk 231 the jet base is misaligned by @xmath9 with the 40 pc - scale lobes .",
    "the bends are probably intrinsic because the jet inclination is large , whereas in powerful jets such bends are usually interpreted as projection effects",
    ". the bends in seyferts might be a sign of interaction between the jet and the nlr gas on parsec scales , and indeed by momentum arguments , low - power jets are more easily bent than high - power jets ."
