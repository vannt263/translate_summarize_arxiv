    "mechanical systems subject to rolling kinetic constraints are one of the most studied argument of classical mechanics , especially for its wideness of applicability in several branches of mechanical sciences : contact mechanics , tribology , wear , robotics , ball bearing theory and control theory applied to moving engines and vehicles are only some of the important fields where the results about pure rolling constraint can be fruitfully used .",
    "it is well known that , when a mechanical system moves in contact with an assigned rough surface , the effective fulfilment of the kinetic conditions determined by the rolling without sliding requirement of the system on the surface depends on the behavior , with respect to the considered law of friction , of the reaction forces acting on the system in the contact points .",
    "for example , the roll of a disk on a rough straight line , considering the coulomb s law of friction , can happen only if the contact force lie inside the friction cone ( see example 1 below ) .",
    "however , even in the simplest case of a mechanical system formed by a single rigid body , in the case of multiple contact points between the rigid body and the rough surface , it could be an hard task to obtain sufficient information about the contact reactions in order to determine if the laws of friction are satisfied or not during the motion .",
    "in fact the most common methods to determine information about the reactions , starting from the simple application of linear and angular momenta equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) to most refined techniques such as lagrangian multipliers in lagrangian mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) or deep analyses of the contact between the system and the surface ( see e.g. @xcite ) , have a global character .",
    "then these methods , for their very nature , can determine only a reactive force system equivalent to the real one but , in the general case , these methods can not determine the single reactive forces in the contact points .",
    "the problem becomes even more complicated in case of multibody system , due to the presence of the internal reactions in the link between the parts of the system .    in this paper",
    "we consider the motion of a mechanical system having two or more distinct contact points with one or more assigned rough surfaces , and we determine necessary conditions for which in all the contact points the pure rolling kinetic constraint can hold .",
    "we also analyze the sufficiency of these conditions by generalizing to this case a well known and usually accepted assumption on the behavior of pure rolling constraint .",
    "moreover , we briefly discuss the possible behaviors of the system when the necessary conditions are not fulfilled .    the procedure to determine if the rolling condition can be fulfilled can be applied both to systems formed by a single rigid body and to multibody systems .",
    "it is essentially based on the application of linear and angular momenta equations to the ( parts forming the ) mechanical system , and therefore it gives an underdetermined system in the unknown single contact reactions .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the lack of complete knowledge of the single contact reactions is not an obstacle to determine the feasibility of the rolling conditions .",
    "it is however important to remark that , although the procedure has a very simple and unassailable theoretic foundation , its effective application to general systems could present insurmountable difficulties .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the general procedure explicitly requires the knowledge of the motion law of the system , and in the general case the explicit time ",
    "dependent expression of the motion can not be obtained because of complications determined by the geometry of the system itself and/or by the integrability of the equations of motion .",
    "nevertheless there are several significative cases where the procedure can be explicitly performed . in the paper , we illustrate three examples with rising complication : the well known case of a disk falling in contact with an inclined plane ( that is presented only to point out some key points of the general procedure ) ; the case of a system formed by a non  coupled pair of disks connected with a bar and moving on the horizontal plane ; the case of a heavy sphere falling in contact with a guide having the form of a v  groove non symmetric with respect to the vertical axis and inclined with respect to the horizontal .",
    "the main content of this paper can be approached starting from a very standard background knowledge , essentially focused to the linear and angular equations of motion for a mechanical system , the so called cardinal equations , and the basic theory of pure rolling conditions and kinetic constraints . on the other hand , the list of possible references involving theory and application of pure rolling constraint is almost endless .",
    "therefore we chose to cite only a very limited list of references sufficient to make the paper self  consistent : the classical book of levi  civita and amaldi @xcite and the book of goldstein @xcite for the cardinal equations and the basic concepts about pure rolling conditions ; the book of neimark and fufaev @xcite and the paper of massa and pagani @xcite for the behavior of systems subject to kinetic constraints .",
    "the interested reader can find in the wide but not exhaustive lists of references of @xcite as a useful starting point to delve in the expanse of the material related to this argument .",
    "the paper is divided in four sections .",
    "section 1 contains a very brief preliminary description of the well known analysis of the rolling condition for a disk in contact with an inclined plane .",
    "this remind is motivated by some useful affinities with the general procedure for generic systems .",
    "section 2 contains the discussion of the general case , and the determination of the necessary conditions for pure rolling conditions simultaneously hold .",
    "section 3 presents the example of the system formed by the non  coupled disks and the example of the heavy sphere falling in the v  groove .",
    "section 4 is devoted to open problems , remarks and conclusions .",
    "an homogeneous disk of mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 moves in the vertical plane being in contact with a rough guide inclined with slope angle @xmath2 .    [ disco ]     considering the system subject to the coulomb s law of friction , with obvious notation clarified by fig .",
    "[ disco ] , the feasibility of pure rolling condition of the disk can be determined with the following procedure :    * we determine the relative velocity @xmath3 of the contact point @xmath4 of the disk at the instant @xmath5 with respect to the inclined plane as function of the initial data of the motion .",
    "the pure rolling condition requires of course that @xmath6 .",
    "if so * we assume that the disk rolls without sliding on the inclined plane .",
    "then the system has a single degree of freedom ( for example the coordinate @xmath7 of @xmath4 along the inclined plane ) and we can determine the equation of motion @xmath8 * we determine the corresponding reaction @xmath9 as a ( in this case constant ) function of time @xmath10 * we test the coulomb s law of friction condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the parallel and orthogonal component of @xmath13 with respect to the inclined plane ; * we assume that , if and until the coulomb s condition is verified , the disk moves rolling on the plane and that if and when the coulomb s condition is not verified , the disk changes its dynamic evolution beginning to slide on the plane ( until the first time @xmath14 such that @xmath15 ) .",
    "some remarks are in order to focus the possibility to generalize the procedure to more complicated systems .",
    "step 2 consists in the determination of the reaction acting on the disk as function of time .",
    "the utmost simplicity of the specific problem can hide the fact that in a more general situation the information about the reaction sufficient to analyze the rolling condition could require an explicit determination of the motion of the system as function of time .",
    "step 3 tests the compatibility of the reaction evaluated in step 2 with the coulomb s law of friction assumed as the constitutive characterization of the rough surface in contact with the disk .",
    "of course the feasibility of the rolling condition can be tested with any other significative constitutive law .    in step 4",
    "we assume that , roughly speaking , if the disk can roll then it does .",
    "this is of course an arbitrary assumption , but the hypothesis is well confirmed by experimental results . in the next section , we will confirm this assumption in the more general situation of generic system .    to conclude the section ,",
    "let us note that , in this very simple case , both the behaviors of the disk when the coulomb s friction condition is or is not verified are determinable . in the general case ,",
    "when the constitutive law is not verified , the behavior of the system turns out to be not so straight to determine , although some reasonable assumptions can be done .",
    "we will go back on this arguments in section 4 .",
    "in this section , following a line of though similar to the one applied in the previous section , we discuss the possibility that a mechanical system @xmath16 having two points @xmath17 in contact with a fixed surface @xmath18 moves such that in both the contact points the rolling conditions can subsist respecting the coulomb s law of friction .",
    "the arguments of the discussion can be easily extended to cases with more ( but a finite number ) than two contact points and possibly to different friction constitutive laws .",
    "the discussion is based on the fact that , along the motion , the reactive forces acting on the system must validate the linear and angular momenta equations @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total mass of the system , @xmath21 is the center of mass of the system and @xmath22 are respectively the sum of the active and reactive forces and active and reactive momenta acting on the whole system . in this specific situation",
    "we have that : @xmath23 it is however well known @xcite that eqs .",
    "( [ sistema_generale ] ) are not sufficient to determine the motion of the mechanical system and the single reactions @xmath24 along the motion , since the system @xmath25 is by its very nature under  determined .",
    "in fact the projection of the angular momenta equation of ( [ sistema_sottodeterminato ] ) in the direction of @xmath26 is a pure equation of motion of the system where no reactions appear . then ( [ sistema_sottodeterminato ] ) can give no more than 5 relations on the components of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the roughness of the contacts , no preliminary conditions can be imposed on the components of the reactions , so that , even when the motion of the mechanical system is known , ( [ sistema_sottodeterminato ] ) is a linear system with @xmath29 unknowns that is not of maximum rank .",
    "nevertheless the parametric solution of the system ( [ determinazione_reazioni ] ) , and an assumption parallelizing the one of step 4 of the case of section 1 , give us the possibility of determining if the rolling conditions in @xmath30 and @xmath31 are or not verified .",
    "the procedure to test the feasibility of pure rolling condition of the disk can be then based on the following steps :    * we test if the initial relative velocities of the contact points @xmath17 with respect to the surface are null or not . if they are null * we suppose that the system rolls without sliding in both the contact points .",
    "this assumption fixes the dynamics ( for example the number of degrees of freedom ... ) of the system and consequently allows the determination of the motion of the system ; * we write the linear and angular momenta equations for the whole system , for example in the form : @xmath32 since the motion of the system is known , both the right hand sides of the equations , together with the position vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are known as function of time",
    ". therefore eqs .",
    "( [ sistema_reazioni ] ) turn out to be a time ",
    "dependent under  determined linear system in the six scalar unknowns given by the components of the vectors @xmath35 ; * we solve the linear under  determined system ( [ sistema_reazioni ] ) , obtaining the expression of the reaction @xmath27 and @xmath28 as function of time and parameters @xmath36 , where of course the integer @xmath37 is related to the rank of ( [ sistema_reazioni ] )",
    ". then we can determine the tangent and orthogonal components @xmath38 of the reactions with respect to the surface @xmath18 as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "the pure rolling conditions then can subsist in both the contact points only in the time interval @xmath40 $ ] such that for every @xmath41 $ ] there exists at least one admissible @xmath37uple @xmath42 such that the system @xmath43 holds ; * we assume that , if for every @xmath41 $ ] there exists at least one admissible @xmath37uple @xmath42 such that ( [ condizioni_cm ] ) are verified , the system moves rolling without sliding in both points @xmath30 and @xmath31 during the time interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that the general procedure described above parallelizes as possible and generalizes the one of the disk on the inclined plane .",
    "the most significant differences consist in the explicit determination of the motion of the system ( since otherwise eqs .",
    "( [ sistema_reazioni ] ) could not admit a simple parametric solution for the reactions @xmath44 and @xmath28 ) and in the fact that , when the coulomb conditions ( [ condizioni_cm ] ) are not verified , being understood that the system does not roll in both contact points , the determination of the behavior of the system could require a more subtle analysis .",
    "we will go back on these arguments in section 4 .",
    "we also remark that not all the @xmath37uple @xmath36 could be admissible in the discussion of the inequalities ( [ condizioni_cm ] ) .",
    "for example , if the system is leaned on the surface , we have to restrict our attention to the @xmath37uple such that @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the unit normal vector to the surface @xmath18 in the point @xmath47 and orientated toward the side of the system ) since otherwise the system detaches from the surface .",

    "[ ruote ] ) so that the disks remain vertical .",
