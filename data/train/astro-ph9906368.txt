    "hierarchical clustering and merging ( hcm ) is the generally accepted paradigm governing the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies . in this paradign , elliptical galaxies are formed by the major merger of disk systems and their associated dark matter halos .",
    "this scenario for forming ellipticals was suggested in the seminal work of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) , and is often referred to as the ` merger hypothesis ' .",
    "this hypothesis has gained much support over the years ( see review by barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "simulations can now be used to track the stellar , gaseous and dark matter evolution of a merger from initial contact , through coalescence of the two nuclei , to the resulting remnant  an elliptical galaxy . on the observational side ,",
    "this simple evolutionary sequence is more difficult to follow .",
    "the main difficulty is one of correctly identifying galaxies at different stages of the evolutionary sequence .",
    "for the first 13 gyrs after a merger the tidal tails produce a clear signature of a disk  disk merger , and acts as a ` clock ' for age  dating the system .",
    "examples of post  tail merger remnants are harder to identify . indeed the lack of clear candidate protoellipticals has been called the ` king gap ' after i. king , who pointed out this potential missing link in 1977 .",
    "balmer lines , associated with the merger  induced starburst , offer another clock . however after @xmath2 3 gyr they have weakened to the point that metallicity effects are comparable to age in dictating the strength of the line .",
    "this is the so  called age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy has meant that ellipticals could not be uniquely age  dated from stellar spectra .",
    "however , recently new spectroscopic observations and models have broken this degeneracy ( e.g. worthey 1994 ; trager 1999 ) .",
    "the number of ellipticals with high quality nuclear spectral indices on the lick / ids system has grown rapidly in the last year .",
    "combined with evolutionary model tracks , these indices can be used to estimate the age of the last major starburst in elliptical galaxies .    in an earlier paper ( forbes 1998 , paper i )",
    "we used such age estimates for 88 early type galaxies to investigate the scatter about the fundamental plane .",
    "as recently as 1996 , j@xmath4rgensen ( 1996 ) found no dependence of the fp residuals on galaxy ellipticity , isophotal shape or relative disk contribution .",
    "they concluded that `` it remains unknown what the source of [ the fp ] scatter is '' .",
    "we showed that the fp residuals correlate strongly with galaxy age .",
    "in addition , the deviation of a galaxy from the mean scaling relations of b ",
    "v colour and mg@xmath3 line index with mass , also correlates with age .",
    "the data are consistent with the steady reddening , increasing line strength and global fading of an ageing burst of star formation .",
    "this reinforces the view that galaxy age estimates are tracing the last major burst of star formation , which has been induced by a gaseous merger event .",
    "here we focus on dynamical effects in evolving elliptical galaxies .",
    "in particular we examine the location of ellipticals with age estimates with respect to the faber ",
    "jackson scaling relation .",
    "in table 1 we give the basic properties of the 88 early type galaxies which have age estimates available from the literature .",
    "we have included all galaxies from the study of kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) in the table , but we have excluded ngc 1399 from our analysis as it is a cd galaxy . from the large compilation of prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) , we list the galaxy name , distance ( which includes virgocentric and great  attractor correction terms for h@xmath5 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) , total b band magnitude , central velocity dispersion and residual from the fundamental plane , i.e. r(@xmath7 .",
    "for the two galaxies which are not part of the prugniel & simien list ( i.e. the elliptical ngc 6127 and the s0 ngc 507 ) , we used faber ( 1989 ) for their properties .",
    "galaxies in our sample have a typical m@xmath0 @xmath2 20.5 and distance of @xmath230 mpc , with 3/4 in low density environments and 1/4 located in clusters .",
    "if available , age estimates come from recent spectroscopic estimates from trager ( 1999 ) , kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) , tantalo ( 1998 ) and mehlert ( 1997 ) . where these were not available we used the youngest ` morphological ' age estimate from schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) .",
    "the reference for each age estimate is also given in table 1 .",
    "these age estimates require some comment .",
    "firstly , the spectroscopic estimates come from the central regions and are luminosity weighted , so a centrally located starburst will dominate the spectral lines and hence the age estimate .",
    "trager ( 1997 ) has shown that even a 10% by mass young starburst occurring at the galaxy centre dominates over light of the old stellar population .",
    "thus the age estimates , in the ideal situation of two distinct stellar populations , will largely reflect that of the young starburst .",
    "secondly , the morphological ages have been ` calibrated ' to a starburst model by schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) . in this sense",
    ", they should also reflect the time since the last major starburst .",
    "if we separate our sample into spectroscopic and morphological ages , both subsamples reveal the trend found in paper i , i.e. fp residuals correlate with galaxy age .    in order to include some younger systems , we have included data for four good candidates for @xmath2 1 gyr remnants of a major gaseous merger . in table 2",
    "we list their galaxy names , distances , absolute b magnitudes , velocity dispersions , fp residuals , age estimates and reference sources .",
    "in paper i we showed that the _ scatter _ about the fp was correlated with galaxy age .",
    "it is also important to determine whether the _ tilt _ of the fp is also strongly affected by age . if the fp tilt results in part from age effects then we might expect to see a relationship between the age of a galaxy and its luminosity .",
    "the initial lick sample of about 40 galaxies , suggested that low luminosity ellipticals were systematically younger than their high luminosity counterparts ( faber 1995 ) .",
    "this is opposite to the trend expected from hcm models ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; baugh 1998 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show the absolute b band magnitude versus galaxy age for our sample .",
    "we also show the mean age and the standard deviation of the data within bins of 1 magnitude .",
    "this reveals a weak trend for increasing mean age with increasing luminosity , but given the large scatter our sample is consistent with no age trend .",
    "one interesting feature is that only giant ellipticals are very old .",
    "can this weak trend explain the tilt of the fp ?",
    "prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) found that the variation of mass - to - light ratio along the fp needed to explain the tilt required m / l@xmath0 @xmath8 l@xmath9 .",
    "for our data set , the factor of 40 change in l@xmath0 ( i.e. 4 mags ) requires a change in m / l@xmath0 by a factor of 2.7 to fully account for the tilt . using the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models we can estimate the change in global m / l@xmath0 for a 10% by mass starburst embedded in an old population ( i.e. as used in paper i ) . from a mean starburst age of 5.8 gyrs ( for the low luminosity galaxies ) to 7.6 gyrs ( for the high luminosity galaxies ) , the m / l@xmath0 ratio changes by a factor of 1.03 .",
    "thus age variations may be responsible for a trend in m / l@xmath0 along the fp of this factor , which is much less than the factor of 2.7 change needed to fully explain the fp tilt .",
    "we conclude that the tilt of the fp , unlike the scatter about the fp , is not driven by galaxy age .",
    "galaxy scaling relations such as b  v or mg@xmath3 vs m@xmath0 or log  @xmath10 are largely sequences of metallicity vs galaxy mass ( e.g. kodama 1998 ) . in paper i",
    "we showed that the scatter about these relations correlate with galaxy age .",
    "in particular , after a merger  induced starburst the system fades , reddens and has an increasing mg@xmath3 line index that is consistent with an ageing burst of star formation .",
    "this simple model provided a reasonable match to the age ",
    "related trends in these scaling relation residuals without the need for any change in the central velocity dispersion ( i.e. dynamical evolution ) following the merger event .",
    "ideally we would like to predict the evolutionary changes within the full fundamental plane , however the difficulty lies in predicting the change of @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) with time .",
    "this would require specific assumptions regarding the radial surface brightess profile of the old stellar population and how the central starburst size changes , and fades , with respect to it .",
    "future simulations may indeed be able to address this issue . in this paper , we examine the overall luminosity evolution of a fading starburst combined with dynamical effects .",
    "the faber ",
    "jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) is another 2d scaling relation that relates absolute magnitude ( or luminosity ) to central velocity dispersion .",
    "it is close to an edge  on view of the fp .",
    "it was also one of the first scaling relations discovered for elliptical galaxies and was used by lake & dressler ( 1986 ) to study the dynamical properties of merger remnants .",
    "the best fit to 229 early type galaxies with m@xmath0 @xmath13 18 from the compilation of prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) gives + log @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the residuals about this fit , i.e. r@xmath15 , against galaxy age for our sample of 88 early type galaxies and the 4 candidate merger  remnants .",
    "the mean residual value for our sample is r@xmath16 = 0.01 indicating that , on average , it is well represented by the relation derived from the larger prugniel & simien sample .",
    "overlaid on the data are two model evolutionary tracks and the combination of the two .",
    "the short dashed line is the track for the model used in paper i , i.e. a 10% ( by mass ) central starburst , of solar metallicity , superposed on an non  evolving old stellar population .",
    "such a model , of a fading central starburst , provided a good representation of the residuals for the four scaling relations given in paper i. this is not the case for the faber ",
    "jackson residuals , where young ellipticals generally lie below the model line and old ellipticals lie above it . a stronger burst ,",
    "e.g. one involving 50% of the galaxy s mass , would provide a steeper curve , which would give a better fit to the data .",
    "however , such a strong burst would give much stronger evolution in colour and line strength than is observed ( see paper i ) , as well as being improbably large when compared to observed starbursts . the burst model in paper",
    "i assumed solar metallicity .",
    "burst models with non  solar metallicities have only a minor impact on the faber ",
    "jackson track , and therefore also fail to reproduce the trend in the data .",
    "merger fading can not explain the magnitude of the trend in the faber ",
    "jackson residuals with age , then this suggests that we should examine the role of dynamics .",
    "all burst models used thus far , have assumed no change in central velocity dispersion with age , for a galaxy of given mass .",
    "we now relax this assumption , and explore the consequences .",
    "we have seen above that fading of a central starburst , which can explain the evolution of colour and mg@xmath3 index rather well ( see paper i ) , is able to account for only about one third of the @xmath17r@xmath18 @xmath19 dex trend in faber ",
    "jackson residuals for galaxies older than 1 gyr , as seen in fig.2 . to explain the bulk of this trend , on the basis of changes in @xmath10 , would require a systematic change in @xmath10 of approximately 60% across the plot . this could be achieved in one of two ways : either ( a ) the central velocity dispersion increases with time after a merger in an individual elliptical galaxy , or ( b ) old ellipticals ( i.e. those formed at high redshift ) formed with systematically higher velocity dispersions ( for a given mass ) that their younger counterparts .",
    "substantial intrinsic dynamical evolution in post ",
    "merger ellipticals , over the long timescales required appears extremely unlikely .",
    "simulations of galaxy merging ( e.g. navarro 1990 ) indicate that the velocity dispersion within the effective radius relaxes on a timescale @xmath20  gyr after nuclear merger .",
    "infall of tidal tail material over the next few gyrs ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) can not extend this timescale greatly , and in any case will have little impact on the central velocity dispersion",
    ".    environmental effects could certainly operate over a longer timescale .",
    "most ellipticals reside in groups and clusters , and may therefore be subject to a variety of external influences .",
    "accretion of satellite galaxies might cause long term changes in @xmath10 without resetting the post  merger age , but this should act in the direction of _ reducing _",
    "@xmath10 , relative to the mean faber ",
    "jackson relation ( hernquist , spergel & heyl 1993 ) .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath10 does not evolve , but that ellipticals formed earlier have higher @xmath10 values .",
    "the hcm models predict that structures collapsing at earlier epochs will have a higher mean density ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , and hence from the virial theorem , will have higher velocity dispersion for a given mass . a number of numerical and theoretical studies ( e.g. cole & lacey 1996 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; tormen , bouchet & white 1997 ; salvador - sole , solanes & manrique 1998 ) suggest that it is reasonable to regard the evolution of dark matter  dominated halos as proceeding via a combination of merging and accretion .",
    "the mean density of a halo , which is set at the time of a substantial merger event , is a multiple of the mean density of the universe at that epoch .",
    "subsequent accretion of material onto the halo does not disrupt the density distribution in its inner regions , so that the central velocity dispersion will remain essentially constant , until it is reset by a further major merger event .",
    "since the dark halos formed in numerical simulations have a universal form ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , which seems to accord well with observations , the velocity dispersion will , by the virial theorem , scale in a simple way with system mass and mean density : @xmath21 where m and r are the mass and virial radius of the system , and @xmath22 is its mean density , which scales ( lacey & cole 1993 ) with the critical density of the universe at the epoch ( @xmath23 ) of its last major merger event . hence a galaxy of a given luminosity ( and therefore mass ) will have a velocity dispersion which depends upon its ` formation ' epoch as @xmath24 . assuming that the 10% starburst coincides with the final merger which assembled the galaxy , the measured post  merger ages provide us with the value of @xmath23 required to evaluate the strength of the velocity dispersion trend predicted by this equation .",
    "the resulting curve relating age to velocity dispersion is cosmology - dependent , via the relationship between look  back time and redshift .    as an example of the magnitude of the effects which are obtained",
    ", we have overlaid in fig . 2 ( long dashed line ) the variation in faber  jackson residuals which result from a flat @xmath25cdm universe with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for h@xmath5 = 60 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "the model has been normalised to zero residual at 10 gyr , as paper i showed that ellipticals lie on the fundamental plane if they have an age of @xmath2 10 gyr . changing the hubble constant has a substantial effect on the model track , e.g. for h@xmath28 = 75",
    "the track lies about 0.1 dex lower around 1 gyr , and is slightly steeper than the h@xmath28 = 60 track for ages older than 10 gyr .",
    "the dynamical trends match the overall magnitude of the residuals fairly well .",
    "but from paper i , we know that there is also an evolutionary effect on m@xmath0 from the fading starburst .",
    "this is shown in fig . 2 by the short dashed line .",
    "the combination of the two effects ( i.e. dynamical trends plus a burst model ) are given by a solid line , which does a reasonable job of describing the trend of f  j residuals with age .    in order for this dynamical effect to be acceptable as an explanation for the bulk of the faber ",
    "jackson residuals , it is essential that it should not conflict with the success of the burst model in explaining the correlations involving colour and mg@xmath3 index , which were discussed in paper i. in practice , the coefficients of log  @xmath1 in the relations with b  v and mg@xmath3 explored in the paper i are small ( @xmath29 ) , so that 60% changes in log  @xmath1 result in only minor perturbations to the successful model fits obtained with the fading burst model under the assumption of no dynamical trends .",
    "our main result concerns the scatter about the faber ",
    "jackson ( f  j ) relation for elliptical galaxies .",
    "we found that the scatter about this scaling relation is correlated with the post  merger age of the galaxy .",
    "young ellipticals are systematically brighter in the b band and/or have a lower central velocity dispersion than the mean relation . the mean relation corresponds to galaxies that are @xmath2 10 gyr old .",
    "we have also shown that we can reproduce the observed trend of the f ",
    "j residuals with age using two simple concepts .",
    "first , we assume that the galaxy has undergone an instantaneous , centrally located starburst involving 10% ( by mass ) of the galaxy .",
    "such a model was very successful at reproducing the b  v and mg@xmath3 evolution reported in our earlier paper , but we find that it can not adequately explain the f  j residuals with time .",
    "we propose that the bulk of the trend in f ",
    "j residuals results from a systematic variation in the internal dynamics . in particular , the central velocity dispersion of a newly formed elliptical scales with the mean density of the universe .",
    "such a change in mean density moves a galaxy around on the fundamental plane , but in the f  j projection of the plane it moves a galaxy away from the mean relation .",
    "the f  j offsets therefore contain information about the epoch of elliptical galaxy assembly , which may be some time after the bulk of its stars were actually formed .",
    "the strength of the dynamical trend observed favours a low value of the hubble constant ( i.e. @xmath30 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) .",
    "we find that a combination of this effect and starburst fading provides a good match to the change in f ",
    "j residuals with galaxy age .",
    "the success of this model suggests that the derived starburst ages measure the time since the galaxy we see was assembled in essentially its present form .",
    "this in turn confirms the important role of recent dissipational mergers in the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our results lend support to the view that the internal dynamical properties of an elliptical galaxy depend on when the galaxy was formed .",
    "the trend in f ",
    "j residuals we observe could have been predicted on the basis of hcm models , but as far as we are aware , they have not been explicitly mentioned in the literature .",
    "it follows that , if the merger of two spirals indeed produces an elliptical galaxy , then today s ongoing mergers will form an elliptical galaxy subtly different from old ellipticals found in nearby clusters .",
    "we might also expect studies of the fundamental plane at redshifts z @xmath2 1 to begin to reveal dynamical differences to local ellipticals .    * acknowledgments * + we thank r. brown , p. james and a. terlevich for help and useful discussions .",
