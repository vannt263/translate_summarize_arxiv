    "it still comes as a surprise to many physicists that the error correction techniques that we now know to exist for quantum states are basically digital and not analog . even after the discovery of quantum error correcting codes@xcite",
    ", it was felt that the analog metaphor must be more appropriate ; after all , a quantum state is specified by a continuous set of complex numbers , and the fundamental physical process which we consider as `` noise '' on the quantum state , unitary transformations involving the state and its environment , also are drawn from a continuous and not a discrete set .",
    "nevertheless , the entangled structure of quantum states , which has no analogy in classical mechanics , permits an essentially digital treatment of errors .",
    "in fact , quantum error correction as we presently understand it@xcite is required to be oblivious to the continuous nature of the quantum state : error correction is accomplished by using a coded subspace such that the effect of the errors and error - correction scheme are both independent of the direction of the state vector in that subspace .",
    "furthermore , these error - correcting actions are not continuous , but are drawn from a discrete set .",
    "this is related to the fact that the continuous action of the environment can also be `` digitized , '' in the following sense : quite generally , noise on a quantum state can be described as a transformation which takes a pure quantum state @xmath3 to a mixed state @xmath4 given as an ensemble of pure states @xmath5 .",
    "each of the set of operators @xmath6 can be written as a linear combination of some fixed operator basis , @xmath7 .",
    "the fixed set of operators @xmath8 are the `` error operators '' of the quantum channel .",
    "there form a finite set with @xmath9 elements , where @xmath10 is the dimension of the hilbert space of @xmath3 . for qubits ( @xmath11 )",
    "it has become conventional to use the error basis @xmath12 ( the pauli matrices ) .",
    "these four operators have a very `` digital '' interpretation . in the simplest memoryless noisy bitwise channel , the `` binary symmetric channel '' ,",
    "each bit is either left alone or is flipped .",
    "this corresponds to the actions of the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 on the @xmath15-basis qubit states . in the quantum case",
    "there are just two other actions ; we refer to the action of @xmath16 as a `` phase flip '' , and that of @xmath17 as `` both a bit flip and a phase flip . ''",
    "an alternative point of view is to represent the quantum state as a two - bit object ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , or an object in a four - element field gf(4 ) @xcite , so that the four operators are just the four possible digital noise actions on them .",
    "the only `` analog '' features left in the description of the quantum channel are the continuous amplitudes @xmath18 ; but these play a very similar role in the quantum noisy channel to the bit - flip probabilities in the classical digital channel .    in this paper",
    "we will concern ourselves with the quantum capacity of a simple qubit channel , the _ depolarizing _ channel .",
    "this channel is completely characterized by one fidelity parameter @xmath0 ; with probability @xmath0 the qubit passes through the channel undisturbed ( @xmath19 ) , while with equal probability @xmath20 the qubit is subjected to a rotation by one of the three pauli matrix operators @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .    defining the quantum capacity",
    "requires a discussion of the quantum error correction codes mentioned above .",
    "this discussion will be given in detail in sec .",
    "ii . suffice it to say now that many quantum codes @xmath23 $ ] are now known @xcite , in which an arbitrary state of @xmath24 qubits are coded into a state of @xmath25 qubits in such a way that if no more than @xmath26 of the @xmath27 qubits are subjected to an error , the original @xmath24-qubit state can nevertheless be perfectly recovered",
    ". the _ rate _ of this code is @xmath28 .    with this",
    ", the _ quantum capacity _ @xmath29 of a quantum channel @xmath30 can be defined : @xmath29 is the maximum number @xmath31 such that for any rate @xmath32 and any @xmath33 there exists a quantum code @xmath34 with rate @xmath35 such that after the action of @xmath30 any state @xmath36 encoded by @xmath37 can be recovered with fidelity at least @xmath38 at the receiving end of the channel@xcite .",
    "naively one might expect there to be a relationship between the achievable capacity @xmath31 for a depolarizing channel of fidelity @xmath0 and the rate @xmath39 of a code in which @xmath40 , since @xmath41 is the expected fraction of qubits on which errors will occur .",
    "in fact , there is no direct relationship because the definition of capacity does not require that all errors of weight less than @xmath42 are correctable , but only that the fraction of uncorrectable errors vanishes for large block sizes .",
    "for example , rains has shown@xcite that all families of codes for which @xmath43 have vanishing rate @xmath39 ; nevertheless , @xmath31 is known to be greater than zero for a range of @xmath44 . indeed , in our previous work on `` one - way hashing , '' @xcite we identified a method for which a non - zero capacity could be attained down to about @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the capacity attained has the form of one minus a von - neumann entropy ( see eq .",
    "( [ hash ] ) ) .",
    "this quantum expression bears a close resemblance to the result of classical information theory , where the maximum information reliably transferable though a noisy channel is limited by the shannon bound @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the average entropy introduced in a bit by classical channel @xmath30 .    in the classical problem",
    "the shannon bound is achieved by a random coding procedure ; the one - way hashing protocol which we invented is the natural quantum analog of random coding .",
    "thus , it was natural to expect that eq .",
    "( [ hash ] ) would also be the upper bound on the quantum capacity for the depolarizing channel .",
    "however , the quantum coding problem has not proved to be exactly parallel to the classical one ; recent work has identified several important properties ( the pipelining inequality , and subadditivity of mutual information ) @xcite which are true for classical capacity measures , but are not for the quantum version .",
    "more concretely , it was recognized early that quantum error correcting codes can have a property referred to as `` degeneracy '' which is not permitted in the quantum case : two different errors may be indistinguishable by their error syndromes , but may nevertheless be both correctable ( see sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] ) .",
    "spurred by intuitive ideas of how this degeneracy might improve the capacity of the quantum channel , shor and smolin @xcite explored some _",
    "non-_random coding strategies , and found a range of depolarizing channels ( very noisy ones ) for which the obvious analog of the shannon bound is violated ; a higher capacity is attained than for random codes .",
    "the main point of this paper is to present the shor - smolin discovery using the more modern and streamlined tools for describing quantum coding which have been developed recently .",
    "we will formulate the capacity calculation in terms of the orthogonal - group formalism @xcite which has proved very successful in systematizing almost all known quantum codes ( the additive codes ) @xcite .",
    "we identify new quantum weight enumerators ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , for the stabilizer _",
    "cosets _ , with which a compact expression for the capacity can be given .",
    "we show that the shor - smolin codes can be understood in the language of code _ concatenation _ which has been very popular for the discussion of fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite . we establish a rather general relation between concatenated - code capacities and the quantum _ coherent information _",
    "@xcite , a quantity believed to be ( but not proved to be in general ) the quantum capacity @xcite .",
    "finally , we show that , using the coset - enumerator formulation , closed - form expressions can be derived for the capacities of the original shor - smolin protocols , which permit us to perform a more extensive quantitative exploration of the performance of these codes .",
    "we do not yet know what the actual attainable capacity of the depolarizing channel is , but hopefully the techniques explored here may provide a clue of how to obtain this result .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] briefly reviews the orthogonal - geometry group theory which has been introduced for the classification of quantum codes , and introduces the necessary coset weight polynomials .",

    "we consider the group @xmath48 introduced in @xcite which describes all possible standard errors on @xmath27 uses of the channel ( described by products of pauli - matrix operators on a set of @xmath27 qubits ) .",

    "all these facts have been discussed previously for quantum codes ; but for the present purposes we need to introduce some additional mathematical objects , the _ cosets _ of @xmath54 in @xmath48 . to understand why these cosets might be natural objects to consider for quantum error correcting codes , we recall that the elements of @xmath68 are the _",
    "stabilizers _ of the code ; this means that if the error suffered by the set of @xmath27 qubits is any member of @xmath54 , then the code state is unaffected .",
    "note that in the same way any element of the coset @xmath69 acts identically on the code ; all such elements act as if just the error @xmath70 had occurred .",
    "for this reason , these cosets will play a central role in the analysis below . note that because @xmath48 is abelian ( n.b .",
    "@xmath52 is _ not _ abelian ) no distinction need be made between left and right cosets .",

    "our weight polynomial @xmath94 has particular significance for the depolarizing channel with fidelity f when @xmath86 is the one of the various cosets which we introduced above :    * @xmath95 is the probability that the coded quantum state will leave the depolarizing channel without error .",
    "each distinct operator @xmath96 is an action of the channel which has this property , and @xmath97 is the probability of that action .",
    "* @xmath98 gives the probability that the coded state leaving the quantum channel is _ detected _ to have no error , but has actually been rotated inside the code eigenspace by @xmath99 .",
    "this is so from the definition of @xmath99 : since it commutes with all elements of @xmath53 , it does not change the eigenvalues of @xmath54 which are detected in the channel - decoding operation@xcite ; and , since by definition @xmath100 , it performs a non - identity rotation of the coded state inside the code eigenspace .",

    "in order to formulate the main result , we first review the shor - smolin procedure@xcite for sending reliable qubit states , with a finite capacity , over a depolarizing channel .",
    "just as in conventional channel coding , it involves an additive code specified above by @xmath68 . in conventional channel coding shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the additive code is used as follows : the state @xmath108 to be transmitted ( we specialize in the figure to a single qubit state ) is rotated by the encoding unitary transformation @xmath109 into the eigenspace @xmath110 of the operators in @xmath54 .",
    "when this state passes through the depolarizing channel , it is rotated into one of the other eigenspaces @xmath111 with some probability : we will analyze this process in detail later . then after passage through the noisy channel , the decoding transformation @xmath112 places @xmath56 of the qubits ( the lower @xmath113 in the figure ) in a state such that",
    ", when they are measured in the standard basis , they give the eigenvalue of each of the @xmath56 generators of @xmath54 , that is , it determines which of the spaces @xmath111 the state had been placed into by the noise@xcite .",

    "when we are sending halves of epr - bell particles through the channel , we no longer discuss the action of the channel in terms of rotations among different code spaces ( no coding transformation has yet been applied to these states ) ; rather , the state of the system at slice @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( which in general is at two different times for the two different sets of particles ) is one in which the set of bell states has been rotated to a set of some of the other bell states with various probabilities which we will discuss shortly .",

    "[ introduction ] to the purification picture .",
    "the fidelity @xmath124 of the depolarizing channel output can be most simply be defined in this picture in the following way : at the end of purification ( slice @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the output is desired to be a collection of @xmath24 @xmath119 states ; if the code scheme is a successful one , then the overlap between the actual state at this slice @xmath126 and the desired bell state will be high ; thus the fidelity for an encoding @xmath122 is @xmath127 the capacity @xmath31 is simply the best rate @xmath128 for a @xmath122 for which this fidelity approaches unity , since each high - fidelity epr pair can be used to teleport one qubit .",
    "the maximization of @xmath31 has proved to be difficult . but",
    "a variety of code families have been introduced for which finite @xmath31s are known , establishing useful lower bounds on the attainable capacity .",
    "one of the most useful is the sequence of _ random additive codes _",
    ", referred to in the original papers @xcite as `` one - way hashing . '' as the name suggests , these sequences are built by selecting , at random , an abelian subgroup @xmath53 from the group of all pauli matrices @xmath52 for successively larger block sizes @xmath27 .",
    "et al._@xcite show that almost all such sequences attain the `` hashing capacity '' @xmath129 thus , @xmath130 is a lower bound on the attainable capacity .",

    "the entropy of the mixture of bell states at slice @xmath117 is just @xmath133 .",
    "the decoding can be simply thought of as a sequence of measurements of the @xmath56 operators which are the generators of @xmath54 .",
    "each of these measurements has two outcomes , splitting the set of possible remaining states in two ; thus , it has the potential for reducing the entropy of the state by one bit .",
    "@xcite provides arguments for why , for almost all choices of @xmath54 and for large @xmath27 , each measurement in fact succeeds in extracting one bit of entropy .",
    "the total state remains a mixture of bell states , so that if @xmath24 is chosen so that the entropy is reduced to zero , i.e. , if @xmath134 , then the bell mixture becomes a pure state , which is to say that the final state is one particular set of known bell states , which can always be rotated with @xmath115 to become a set of @xmath119 states",
    ". thus , purification has succeeded , and the ratio @xmath128 attains the value given in eq .",
    "( [ hash ] ) .",
    "this result naturally raises the question of whether there exist any _ non - randomly _ chosen sequences of codes which could attain a capacity exceeding eq .",

    "while appeal to analogous classical results and other thinking suggested that random coding would be optimal , the shor - smolin construction which we now review shows that higher capacities are attainable .",

    "the codes whose capacity we will consider involve @xmath138 , but fixed @xmath139 . while we tend to associate `` good '' ( i.e. , high - capacity ) codes with large distance @xmath10 , we will find that the desirable inner @xmath136 $ ] codes actually have a _ small _ distance @xmath10 .",
    "as we discuss at the end , it may be the `` degeneracy '' of this code which is relevant .",
    "shor and smolin showed @xcite that the following capacity is attainable by this concatenated scheme : @xmath140 the @xmath141 just comes from the fact that the whole scheme requires @xmath142 bits rather than just @xmath27 bits to be sent through the channel .",

    "the two noisy - channel transmission constructions which we have discussed above are equivalent to yet a third one shown in fig .",

    "it is obvious that the counting is the same for any permutation of the qubits ; this means that there are @xmath215 equivalent cosets being counted .",

    "nevertheless , the threshold for @xmath0 specified by @xmath228 is simply obtained by equation the bases of these two contributions : @xmath229 the relevant root of this equation , @xmath230 , is the asymptotic threshold .",
    "we have not developed any simple intuitive understanding for why this threshold should remain finite as @xmath223 , but nevertheless remain worse than the threshold for finite @xmath139 as we will now see .",

    "the capacities @xmath155 of these codes near @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sschart ] .",
    "we note that odd-@xmath139 codes work better than nearby even-@xmath139 codes ; the lowest threshold fidelity in this family is achieved for @xmath231 .",
    "generically , many other multiple - concatenation codes are possible and may lead to better thresholds .",
    "we explored the family of codes where the innermost code has a rotated cat code for which the stabilizers are : @xmath232 and the next - level code remains the ordinary cat code of eq .",
    "( [ sigmazp ] ) .",
    "the best code we found was for both inner and outer cat - codes having @xmath231 .",
    "the capacity of this code was found to be non - zero down to a fidelity of @xmath233 , the best code known@xcite .",
    "this threshold is still far above the best known lower bound for the threshold of @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , larger codes become computationally intractable using our methods , because the number of distinct cosets scales exponentially with @xmath139 . it is hoped that another approach , perhaps an approximation method for coset weights , will permit a more thorough exploration of concatenated codes .",
    "the obvious unanswered question which this work raises is , can any finite capacity be achieved for even noisier depolarizing channels , ones with @xmath0 below the lowest value , @xmath235 , achievable with the 25-bit inner code , but above the absolute minimum threshold @xmath236 set by the no - cloning argument@xcite ?",
    "in other words , do there exist even more clever non - random codes ( recall @xcite ) for protecting qubits from high levels of noise ?",
    "it may be worthwhile to note here why we initially believed that the use of inner codes of the cat type was a promising direction for finding good codes for very noisy channels ; this belief was based on the property of degeneracy mentioned earlier .",
    "while these motivations may end up having no more than historical interest , since they have not at present led us to any conclusive answer to the questions just posed , we hope that it might assist some reader who is interested in exploring these problems further .",
    "_ degeneracy _ is a property of quantum codes which has no analog for classical error correcting codes .",
    "degeneracy arises from the fact that two different error patterns can have indistinguishable effects on a coded quantum state .",
    "this is obviously impossible for a coded binary ( classical ) string , but it is _ obligatory _ for additive quantum codes ; indeed , the cosets of @xmath54 introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] are precisely these groups of indistinguishable errors . a code is considered degenerate if some of the low - weight ( @xmath237 for an @xmath23 $ ] code ) error patterns fall in the same coset of @xmath54 and are therefore indistinguishable .",
    "the original 9-bit code of shor@xcite was degenerate ; the 7-bit code @xcite and the 5-bit code@xcite are non - degenerate",
    ".    it is known @xcite that a hamming - like bound could be easily derived on the maximum attainable distance for a quantum code , _ provided _ that it was non - degenerate .",
    "however , in this work the possibility remained open that degenerate codes could attain a greater distance .",
    "we were thus motivated to consider highly degenerate codes for the attainment of high capacity , given the qualitative relationship between code distance and capacity .",
    "this possibility of attaining large distance using degeneracy has subsequently been rendered unlikely by a recent result of rains@xcite who has obtained a bound on @xmath10 which applies for both degenerate and non - degenerate codes and which is tighter than the hamming bound for a substantial part of the @xmath238 parameter space .",
    "nevertheless the fact is that the cat codes , which we have used successfully to attain high capacity , are highly degenerate : single phase errors are all indistinguishable , and all pairs of amplitude errors are indistinguishable from the no - error process .",
    "all this is true despite the fact that the cat codes have very poor distance ( @xmath239 for all @xmath139 ) .",
    "the best we can say about why this scheme succeeded is that the high degeneracy , by making many outcomes indistinguishable , `` hides '' the large amount of entropy which the very noisy channel adds to the quantum states , thus permitting the average entropy @xmath143 to be below one over a greater range of @xmath0 .",
    "this reasoning is certainly not rigorous ; nevertheless , in an extensive monte - carlo search of other additive codes , we found no other inner code with @xmath240 which does a better job than the cat code for reducing the average entropy and hence attaining any higher capacity .",
    "it was further the observation that the cat code `` hides '' phase error more effectively than amplitude error that motivated us to consider a second level of concatenation , in which the innermost code was a cat code with the role of amplitude and phase reversed .",
    "of course , this is what led us to the 25-bit code described above which give the best capacity to date .",
    "it is clear that further generalizations of this problem await exploration .",
    "the issue of attainable capacities for channels other than the depolarizing channel is largely untouched .",
    "it is fairly clear that for the _ generalized _ depolarizing channel , in which the error operators are still proportional to the pauli matrices , but with unequal probability amplitudes , the formalism developed here ( i.e. , the weight polynomials , and the relation to coherent information ) will go through with little modification , so that would be an easy direction for further study . for the much larger space of general channels , nothing better than our `` twirling '' arguments of @xcite ( which bounds the capacity of any arbitrary channel by that of a corresponding generalized depolarizing channel )",
    "is presently known .",
    "further extensions of the formalism would obviously also be desirable ; a generalization of the present approach for inner codes with @xmath241 would be desirable ; also , asymptotic expressions for the capacity which would not require an exact evaluation of all the coset weight polynomials could lead to significant progress .",
    "certainly there remains much to be done to fully characterize the usefulness of the very noisy quantum channel .",
