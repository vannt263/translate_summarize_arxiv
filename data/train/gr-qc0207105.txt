    "an implicit fundamental assumption in relativistic perturbation theory is that there exists a parametric family of spacetimes such that the perturbative formalism is built as a taylor expansion of this family around a background .",
    "the perturbations are then defined as the derivative terms of this series , evaluated on this background  @xcite . in most cases of interest one deals with an expansion in a single parameter , which can either be a formal one , as in cosmology  @xcite or in the study of quasi ",
    "normal modes of stars and black holes  @xcite , or can have a specific physical meaning , as in the study of binary black hole mergers via the close limit approximation  @xcite , or in the study of quasi",
    " normal mode excitation by a physical source ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "typically the perturbative expansion stops at the first order , but recent interesting developments deal with second order perturbations  @xcite .    in some physical applications it may be instead convenient to construct a perturbative formalism based on two ( or more ) parameters , because the choice of background is crucial in having a manageable theory .",
    "the study of perturbations of stationary axisymmetric rotating stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) is a good example . in this case ,",
    "an analytic stationary axisymmetric solution is not known , at least for reasonably interesting equations of state .",
    "a common procedure is to treat axisymmetric stars using the so ",
    "called slow rotation approximation , so that the background is a star with spherical symmetry  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the first order in @xmath0 discloses frame dragging effects , with the star actually remaining spherical ; @xmath3 terms carry the effects of rotation on the fluid .",
    "this is intuitive from a newtonian point of view , as rotational kinetic energy goes like @xmath4 .",
    "this approximation is valid for angular velocities @xmath0 much smaller than the mass shedding limit @xmath5 , with typical values for neutron stars @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the slow rotation approximation , despite the name , can still be valid for large angular velocities . in practice ,",
    "the perturbative approach up to @xmath3 is accurate for most astrophysical situations , with the exception of newly born neutron stars ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    given that the differential operators appearing in the perturbative treatment of a problem are those defined on the background , the theory is considerably simplified when the latter is spherical .",
    "generic time dependent perturbations of the rotating star ( parametrized by a dummy parameter @xmath1 and describing oscillations ) are then built on top of the stationary axisymmetric perturbations in @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , in this approach any interesting physics requires non  linear perturbations , as at least terms of order @xmath2 need to be considered .",
    "a similar approach could be used to study perturbations of the slowly rotating collapse , even if in specific cases  @xcite the perturbative expansion depends by one parameter only .",
    "classical studies in the literature have not analysed in full the gauge dependence and gauge invariance of the non - linear perturbation theory .",
    "for example , in  @xcite the second order perturbations are treated in a gauge invariant fashion on top of the first order perturbation in a given specific gauge .",
    "the perturbation variables used are therefore non gauge invariant under a complete second order gauge transformation  @xcite , but only invariant under `` first order transformations acting at second order ''  @xcite . while this may be perfectly satisfactory from the point of view of obtaining physical results",
    ", one may wish to convert results in a given gauge to a different one  @xcite , to compare results obtained in two different gauges , or to construct a fully gauge invariant formalism . to this end",
    "one needs to know the gauge transformation rules and the rules for gauge invariance , either _ up to _ order @xmath7  @xcite or _ at _ order @xmath7 _ only _ , as in  @xcite .",
    "the situation is going to be more complicated in the case of two parameters , as we shall see .    in this paper",
    "we keep in mind the above practical examples , but we do not make any specific assumption on the background spacetime and the two ",
    "parameter family it belongs to . as in @xcite , we do not even need to assume that the background is a solution of einstein s field equations : the formalism is completely general and can be applied to any spacetime theory .",
    "we analyse the gauge dependence of perturbations in the case when they depend on two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , derive explicit gauge transformation rules up to fourth order , i.e.  including any term @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and define gauge invariance .",
    "this choice of keeping fixed the total perturbative order is due to the generality of our approach . in practical applications",
    "one would be guided by the physical characteristics of the problem in deciding where to truncate the perturbative expansion .",
    "for example , in the case of a rotating star one could consider first order oscillations , parametrized by @xmath1 , on top of a stationary axisymmetric background described up to @xmath3 , neglecting therefore @xmath10 terms . or instead , one could decide that @xmath10 terms are more interesting than the @xmath11 ones in certain cases .    from a practical point of view ,",
    "our aim is to derive the effects of gauge transformations on tensor fields @xmath12 up to order @xmath13 .",
    "it is indeed reasonable to assume that in a practical example like that of rotating stars , at most one will want to consider second order oscillations  @xmath14 on top of a slowly rotating background described up to @xmath15 , in order to take into account large oscillations and fluid deformations due to rotation .",
    "we will show that the coordinate form of a two  parameter gauge transformation can be represented by : ^ & = & x^+^_(1,0)+ ^_(0,1 ) + & & + ( ^_(2,0)+^_(1,0 ) ^_(1,0 ) , ) + ( ^_(0,2)+^_(0,1 ) ^_(0,1 ) , ) + & & + ( ^_(1,1)+_0^_(1,0 ) ^_(0,1),+_1^_(0,1 ) ^_(1,0),)+o^3 ( , ) , [ coord2 ] where the full expression is given in eq .",

    "we follow the notation used previously in @xcite for the case of one parameter perturbations .",
    "in order to consider the issues of gauge transformations and gauge invariance in two  parameter perturbation theory we need first to introduce some mathematical tools concerning the two  parameter taylor expansion of tensor fields .",
    "since taylor expansions are aimed to provide the value of a quantity at some point in terms of its value , and the value of its derivatives , at another point , a taylor expansion of tensorial quantities can only be defined through a mapping between tensors at different points of the manifold under consideration . in this section",

    "all our expressions are immediately translated into components simply by using the expression of the components of the lie derivative of a tensor .",
    "nonetheless , much of the literature on the subject is written using coordinate systems , and gauge transformations are most often represented by the corresponding coordinate transformations .",
    "for this reason , we devote this subsection to describe how to establish the translation between the two languages , giving in particular the explicit transformation of coordinates ( further details are in @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the situation described in fig .",
    "[ fig : gtcoord ] .",
    "we have considered two gauge choices , represented by the groups of diffeomorphisms @xmath66 and @xmath102 , under which the point @xmath61 in the physical manifold @xmath75 corresponds to two different points in the background manifold @xmath63 , namely @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the transformation relating these two gauge choices is described by the two ",
    "parameter family of diffeomorphisms @xmath147 , so that @xmath148 .",
    "this gauge transformation maps a tensor field @xmath12 on @xmath149 to the tensor field @xmath150 on @xmath151 .",
    "now , let us consider a chart @xmath152 on an open subset @xmath153 of @xmath63 .",
    "the gauges @xmath89 and @xmath154 define two maps from @xmath75 to @xmath155 :    lccc ^-1 _ , : & _ , & & ^m + & o & |&x(q(o ) ) , +    lccc ^-1 _ , : & _ , & & ^m + & o & |&x(p(o ) ) .",
    "+    then , we can look at the gauge transformation @xmath35 in two different ways : from the _ active _ point of view or from the _ passive _ point of view . in the first case ,",
    "one considers a diffeomorphism which changes the point on the background @xmath63 . to these points",
    "one associates different values of the coordinates in the chart @xmath152 .",
    "so the coordinate change is given by x^(p )  x^(q ) or , defining the pull  back of @xmath59 as @xmath156 , x^(p )  x^(p ) .",
    "if we instead consider the passive point of view , we need to introduce a new chart @xmath157 : : = _ , ^-1 , such that the two sets of coordinates are related by y^(q)=x^(p ) , so we can say that the gauge transformation does not change the point on @xmath63 , but it changes the chart from @xmath152 to @xmath158 , i.e.  the labels of the point of @xmath63 .",
    "the coordinate transformation is then x^(q )  y^(q ) .",
    "now , let us consider the transformation of a vector field @xmath159 . from the active point of view , the components of @xmath159 in the chart @xmath152 , @xmath160 , are related with the ones of the transformed vector field @xmath161 , @xmath162 , by ^= ( _ * ) ^= ( _ * _ , ^*v)^. from the passive point of view , we can use the properties relating the pull  back and push  forward maps associated with diffeomorphisms : _ * _ , ^*v= _ * ^-1_*,v= _ * v , so we get the well known result that the components of the transformed vector @xmath161 in the coordinate system @xmath62 are defined in terms of the components of the vector @xmath159 in the new coordinate system @xmath163 : ^(x(p))= ( _ * v(q))^= v^(y(q))= .",
