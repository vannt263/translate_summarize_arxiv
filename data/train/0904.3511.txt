    "the interaction of strong laser radiation with atoms and molecules generates a variety of highly nonlinear phenomena . these include the extended photoelectron spectrum of above - threshold ionization ( ati ) , the excessive yield of doubly and multiply charged ions , the generation of very high harmonics of the driving field , and the yield of neutral atoms in excited rydberg states ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the generally recognized transparent physical picture of the first three phenomena is based on the so - called direct ionization and rescattering scenario . according to it ,",
    "electrons are promoted to the continuum via tunneling ionization and , while oscillating in the laser field , interact with their parent ions .",
    "most of the ionized electrons , i.e. the `` direct '' electrons , are decelerated and deflected by the ion at small angles and finally contribute to the low - energy part of the photoelectron spectrum . in some rare cases , the ionized electron returns close to its parent ion and recombines emitting a high - frequency harmonic photon or kicks out one or several electrons , producing thereby a doubly or multiply charged ion .",
    "yet another opportunity upon the close encounter is that the electron is elastically backscattered and thereafter acquires additional energy from the laser field .",
    "such electrons contribute to the high - energy part of the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "the rescattering picture is explicitly realized in terms of complex `` quantum orbits '' or even simpler in terms of the two- and three - step semiclassical models . in the latter",
    ", real electron trajectories after ionization are calculated with newton s equations .",
    "the interpretation of the afore - mentioned processes is largely classical , based on trajectories obtained from newton s equations .",
    "population trapping in rydberg states resulting in an excited neutral atom at the end of the laser pulse is an exception because until recently its interpretation was purely quantum mechanical .",
    "the effect was considered as evidence of the existence of stabilization against ionization and studied theoretically and experimentally in many papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally believed that there are two different mechanisms of stabilization : adiabatic stabilization ( stabilization in the kramers  henneberger regime ) and interference stabilization .",
    "the adiabatic approach is appropriate when the field frequency @xmath0 exceeds the atomic ionization potential @xmath1 so that the states in the discrete spectrum and the continuum are coupled by one - photon transitions . in experiments with optical lasers , such conditions were realized by initially populating rydberg states .",
    "the physical mechanism behind interference stabilization is associated with multiple raman - type transitions between the rydberg levels and the common continuum .",
    "destructive interference of the transition amplitudes from these coherently populated states to the continuum suppresses ionization and , hence , serves to retain population in rydberg states .    the recent paper @xcite reports data on the yield of neutral excited he@xmath2 atoms and singly charged ions he@xmath3 from a gaseous target irradiated by 30-fs titanium - sapphire ( ti : sa ) laser pulses with intensities up to @xmath4 w/@xmath5 .",
    "the data , corrected for the radiative decay of neutral excited atoms on the way to the detector , fairly well agree with the results of extensive quantum - mechanical calculations .",
    "the latter were accomplished in two ways : by approximately solving the two - electron tdse for helium exposed to a laser field and in single - active - electron ( sae ) approximation .",
    "the excited neutral atom yield is roughly 20% of the ion yield at lower intensities decreasing to about 10% at higher intensities .",
    "in addition , a two - step semiclassical model was employed for the first time for providing a simple picture of the dynamics resulting in the population of rydberg states .",
    "monte - carlo calculations were performed with classical trajectories in the combined coulomb potential and electric laser field .",
    "those electrons are captured into bound states of the neutral atom that have negative total ( kinetic plus coulomb ) energy at the end of the laser pulse .",
    "the energy distribution in the subset of bound trajectories was converted into the distribution in an effective principal quantum number @xmath6 and the latter was found to be in qualitative and even quantitative agreement with the one deduced from quantum calculations .",
    "the implication of this study is that in monte - carlo simulations with classical trajectories in the laser field and the ionic coulomb field not all electrons that tunneled out at some time are actually ionized after the end of the laser pulse .",
    "some may be captured back into bound states .",
    "this outcome of the electron motion in the continuum was dubbed frustrated tunneling ionization ( fti ) in @xcite .",
    "transient trapping in rydberg states during the laser pulse was mentioned earlier in @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , there are no comments on the formation of excited neutral atoms at the end of the pulse in the papers where monte - carlo simulation of classical trajectories after tunneling was used to model the effect of coulomb focusing on the rescattering processes @xcite or to investigate the low - energy photoelectron spectra @xcite .    in this paper , we further exploit the semiclassical model : ( i ) to get deeper insight into the mechanism responsible for the yield of neutral exited atoms ; ( ii ) to find out the scaling of this yield with the laser  atom parameters ; and ( iii ) to understand the impact of the population trapping on the momentum distributions of the ionized electrons .",
    "in this section we will sketch our simulation technique with special emphasis on the details that are essential for the following .",
    "let us consider a neutral atom with the ionization potential @xmath1 , irradiated by a short laser pulse with the duration @xmath7 and sine - square envelope , linearly polarized along the @xmath8 axis : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of cycles and @xmath0 is the carrier frequency . at time @xmath11 the bound electron tunnels out of the atom quasistatically with the rate @xmath12^{3/2}\\right\\}.      \\label{rate}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 and @xmath13 are the ionization potential and the characteristic atomic force of the bound state ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 for the ground state of hydrogen ) .",

    "@xmath18 the electron has zero longitudinal and nonzero initial transverse velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the released electron moves along a classical trajectory under the action of the laser field and the coulomb force of its residual ion .",
    "the initial conditions unambiguously determine its position @xmath20 and velocity @xmath21 at any time instant @xmath22 . in the limit of large @xmath22",
    ", one obtains the asymptotic momentum @xmath23 , which is identical with the momentum measured by the detector . during the whole laser pulse @xmath24 , an ensemble of trajectories",
    "is launched corresponding to different pairs @xmath25 weighted with the probability ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "no interference effects are accounted for . in our simulations we employed about @xmath26 trajectories",
    "regardless of the intensity . by solving the respective newton equations one obtains @xmath27 and @xmath28 for each trajectory . the ratio of the number of trajectories in a particular bin of momentum space to the total number of trajectories is the momentum distribution at given time @xmath22 normalized to unity .",
    "it evolves in time and in the limit @xmath29 can be compared with the experimental data .",
    "the picture described in the previous paragraph is not complete , however . indeed ,",
    "if the coulomb field of the nucleus is included into the newton equations then , for some initial conditions @xmath30 , the electron s momentum simply does not converge to any constant value but keeps oscillating in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "such trajectories correspond to those electrons whose total energy after the end of the laser pulse is negative @xmath32 so that they never reach a detector .",
    "following @xcite we interpret these electrons as trapped in rydberg states ( captured electrons ) . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electron velocity and its distance from the ion at the end of the laser pulse , respectively . starting with the time @xmath35 the electron moves only in the coulomb field , and its energy as well as the angular momentum",

    "thus , since this time the whole ensemble of trajectories can be subdivided into two subsets .",

    "the profile of the laser pulse is also shown in the figure .",
    "figure [ cockroach ] reveals two main features .",

    "it occurs only when @xmath45 is less than some maximum value ( approximately 0.3 for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ cockroach ] ) .",
    "but this is not yet a sufficient condition .",

    "is shown by a blue line .",
    "( b ) the same as in ( a ) , but for the dominant maximum of the pulse .",
    "dark means high electron yield.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      to understand the results of fig .",
    "[ cockroach ] one should keep in mind that the momentum ( velocity ) @xmath46 and the distance @xmath47 in the capture condition ( [ condition ] ) are actually correlated .",
    "the larger the momentum , the larger is the electron distance and the smaller is the potential energy and , hence , the electron can not be trapped . with the equality sign , eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) sets an upper limit for @xmath48 .",
    "regarding smaller values for @xmath48 , the electron can have a small drift momentum at the end of the laser pulse only under certain conditions .",
    "the trajectories of electrons ionized near the field extrema with initially small drift momentum along the laser field and with small transverse velocity are strongly affected by the attraction of the coulomb field .",
    "while such an electron oscillates in the laser field , a single `` hard '' collision or a sequence of `` soft '' collisions @xcite are likely to increase its drift momentum so that , with very high probability , it is not a candidate for capture anymore . on closer inspection , this holds for electrons that start their orbit _",
    "after _ an extremum of the field . in this case , the drift momentum imparted by the laser field is directed towards the ion .",
    "the net effect of the laser field is that these electrons are driven back to the ion at least once if not many times .",
    "an example of such a trajectory is shown in fig .",
    "[ tr ] by the solid line .",
    "the coulomb force still further increases the drift momentum in the direction towards the ion .",
    "inevitably electrons with large drift momentum return back to the ion and scatter depending on the magnitude of their impact parameter . the opportunity to avoid strong interaction with the ion and have sufficiently small drift momentum at the end of the laser pulse exists for electrons which start in the continuum _ before _ the field extremum . without the coulomb field , while oscillating in the laser field they drift away from their parent ion and never return to its vicinity ( the trajectory shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "the coulomb attraction reduces the drift momentum without reversing its direction , so that the trajectory remains `` on the average outgoing '' .",
    "this classification of trajectories is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ tr ] .    to support this general conclusion ,",
    "let us consider the contribution to the capture process from a single half cycle of the laser field , for example , from the central maximum of the field ( [ field ] ) .",
    "with time counted from this maximum and for phases within the interval @xmath49 , the field and its vector potential are simplified as @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the momentum at the end of the laser pulse of an electron tunneling at time @xmath11 with nonzero transverse velocity can be written as @xmath52 at @xmath53 the momentum ( [ momentum ] ) evolves in the coulomb field .",
    "the trajectory starts at the tunnel exit @xmath54 and the field @xmath55 accelerates the electron away from it .",
    "for the laser  atom parameters of interest , the coulomb force is small in comparison to the laser field already at the tunnel exit and rapidly decreases when the electron departs from the ion .",
    "for example , with the parameters of figs . 1 and [ tr ] and not too far from the field maximum",
    "one has @xmath56 a.u . , while the oscillation amplitude @xmath57 is about 40 a.u .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the contribution of the coulomb force in eq.([momentum ] )    @xmath58    as the integral along the initial part of the electron trajectory @xmath59 and to extend the upper integration limit to infinity @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the integral ( [ momintegr ] ) for not very large transverse velocities , @xmath60 , gives the drift momentum ( [ momentum ] ) in the plane defined by the directions of the field ( @xmath8 axis ) and of the transverse initial velocity ( @xmath61 axis ) : @xmath62 except for the numerical factor , the coulomb contribution to the drift momentum ( [ qx ] ) is just the product of the coulomb force at the tunnel exit , @xmath63 , and the time interval @xmath64 over which the electron  ion distance doubles .",
    "not surprisingly , this time interval coincides with the time of flight under the potential barrier , @xmath65 , introduced by keldysh .    for the next half period ,",
    "the laser field changes its direction and pulls the outgoing electron back to the ion .",
    "but , for @xmath66 , the minimum distance in the @xmath8 direction between the electron and the ion will be larger than the tunnel exit @xmath67 by the drift displacement @xmath68 .",
    "so , if this displacement is of the order of or larger than @xmath67 , the coulomb force upon the closest approach is less than the one at the time of tunneling , and its effect can be neglected .",
    "in such cases , the drift momentum given by ( [ qx ] ) and ( [ qy ] ) remains practically constant during the rest of the laser pulse .",
    "this allows us to estimate the electron ",
    "ion distance at the end of the laser pulse in eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) as    @xmath69    where @xmath70 . with the momentum and the distance at the end of the laser pulse known as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the condition ( [ condition ] ) determines the subspace of the initial parameters that result in capture to the bound states :    @xmath71    it is immediately obvious that the number of trapped electrons decreases with increasing time that the electron spends in the laser field after ionization .",
    "this explains the difference in the number of electrons captured from identical laser half - periods before and after the field maximum , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ cockroach]a .",
    "next , we try to obtain a rough analytical estimate for the relative yield of neutral excited atoms with respect to singly charged ions , i.e. the ratio @xmath72 , in a short laser pulse .",
    "the numbers @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be evaluated by integrating the rate ( [ rate ] ) over the respective parts of the @xmath25-plane shown in fig .",
    "[ cockroach]a . to a fair approximation",
    ", the integration can be performed over the initial conditions related to the central maximum of the field .",
    "furthermore , applying the theorem of the mean to both integrals , we assume that the rates ( [ rate ] ) do not differ essentially and cancel out in their ratio , which thereby is estimated as @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 are the areas of the @xmath25 plane effective for population trapping and real ionization , respectively . for ions from the central maximum of the field we have @xmath78 , where the second factor is the width of the rate ( [ rate ] ) in the initial velocity .    for the neutrals",
    ", @xmath76 is just the area of the crescent - shaped region in fig .",
    "[ cockroach]b .",

    "( [ holeexp ] ) can also be used to explain the origin of the unpopulated area in fig . [ ourhole](a ) : in fact , at the end of the laser pulse electrons can be found at various finite distances from the ion .",

    "furthermore , we show that for an electron to be captured it ( i ) has to have moderate drift momentum at the time of tunneling and ( ii ) has to avoid strong interaction ( `` hard '' collision ) with the ion .",
    "such trajectories do exist when electrons are released within a narrow time window before the extrema of the oscillating laser field having a not too large transverse velocity @xmath136 .",
    "understanding these features has allowed us to derive the scaling of the ratio of neutral excited atoms and singly charged ions with the laser  atom parameters in analytic form .",
    "its prediction , that the percentage of neutrals increases with decreasing intensity or pulse duration , fits into the general physical picture : in both cases , the electron drifts away from the ion by a smaller distance during the laser pulse and experiences a stronger coulomb attraction .",
    "this distance is smaller at lower intensity because of a reduced drift momentum imparted by the laser field and , in the other case of a shorter pulse , because of a smaller travel time .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that the channel of capture , when accounted for in semiclassical calculations , has a pronounced effect on the momentum distribution of electrons with small positive energy . in particular , it is correlated with the formation of a `` dip '' at zero momentum in the distribution of the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the authors would like to thank u.  eichmann , m. v.  fedorov , and a. m.  popov for stimulating and useful discussions .",
    "this work was in part supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and by the russian foundation for basic research ."
