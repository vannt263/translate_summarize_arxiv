    "a @xmath5-hypernucleus decays via the weak interaction mainly by two decay mechanisms : the so - called mesonic decay @xmath7 and the nonmesonic one @xmath8 , where no meson is present in the final state ( for review articles see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9-decay width is denoted as @xmath10 , which is defined as the sum of @xmath11 plus @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13-decay width itself is the sum of @xmath14 plus @xmath15 .",
    "experimental values are given for @xmath10 , the ratio @xmath16 and the asymmetry of the protons emitted in the @xmath9 decay of polarized hypernuclei .",
    "in the present contribution , we focuss on @xmath10 , evaluated in nuclear matter together with the local density approximation which allows us to analyze the @xmath0 hypernucleus .    in the past",
    ", it has been an usual statement to assert that while the theory accounts for the experimental values of @xmath10 , the same is not true for the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , the disagreement between the theoretical and the experimental value for this ratio , has been named as `` the @xmath17-puzzle '' .",
    "this situation has changed in recent years : new theoretical analysis together with more experimental information , have led us to a solution of the so - called puzzle .",
    "a typical theoretical value for the ratio for @xmath0 is @xmath18 , while data analyzed by means of the intranuclear cascade code ( inc )  @xcite , gives a result @xmath19 .",
    "however , it should be noted that there still exist discrepancies with some nucleon spectra .",
    "for instance , the experimental single coincidence proton spectra for @xmath0 is not well reproduced yet .    in nuclear matter",
    "( using the local density approximation ) , some reported calculations for @xmath13 for @xmath0 , have values in the range between 0.5  @xcite up to 1.45  @xcite ( given in units of the @xmath5-free decay width , @xmath20 ) . while typically @xmath21 .",
    "the most recent experimental determination of @xmath10 has been done by outa et al .",
    "@xcite , whom have reported a value @xmath22 .",
    "some previous experimental determinations are @xmath23  @xcite , @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "there is some incompatibility between the result in  @xcite , due to sato et al . and both noumi et al .",
    "@xcite and outa et al .",
    "we have relied on the outa result , not only because it is the most recent one , but also due to it compatibility with both  @xcite and @xcite - values . beyond this controversy ,",
    "the more precise determination of @xmath26 offers us the opportunity to revise the theoretical determination of @xmath10 . in two previous works , a model for the evaluation of @xmath13 and @xmath27",

    "our scheme employs the same microscopic formalism and interactions for both @xmath13 and @xmath27 . within this model",
    ", the reproduction of @xmath26 seems not possible : the predicted values are always too big .",
    "the main concern of this work is to understand and solve this problem .    to solve this problem",
    "it has been revised the way in which @xmath27 is added to @xmath13 , to build up @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath27-contribution is originated from ground state correlations and the simple addition of @xmath27 plus @xmath13 , would add some spurious intensity because the ground state is not normalized to one .",
    "this point turns out to be relevant not only in the determination of @xmath10 , but also for the @xmath28-ratio , which is used as an input in the determination of @xmath29 . as a further comment on this point , the lack in the normalization",
    "is not restricted to our particular model , but to any calculation where @xmath27 is considered .",
    "a second point refers to the implementation of short range correlations ( @xmath30 ) in nuclear matter .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath27 this has to be done with some particular care due to numerical reasons .",
    "the implementation of these two points in the already developed formalism for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , gives a @xmath10-value in good agreement with data .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ gsc ] , our model for the renormalization of the ground state is presented , showing a scheme to add @xmath27 to @xmath10 . in sect .",
    "[ src ] , a model for the @xmath30 in nuclear matter is discussed in detail .",
    "numerical results are shown in sect .",
    "[ results ] , together with an analysis of the implications of the corrections . finally , in sect .  [ conclusions ] , some conclusions are given .",
    "to start with , we write down the partial decay width @xmath32 in a schematic way as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the ground state and the final state , respectively ; @xmath36 is the two - body transition potential and @xmath37 represents an energy - momentum four - vector .",
    "the fermi momentum is denoted as @xmath38 . by performing the integration over @xmath38 using the local density approximation ( see  @xcite ) , the total decay width @xmath10 is obtained .",
    "now , the ground state can be written as , @xmath39 where the second term in the right hand side of the equation represents @xmath40-correlations . in this equation @xmath41 ,",
    "is the hartree - fock vacuum . in the denominator ,",
    "@xmath42 are the single particle energies .",
    "the nuclear residual interaction is represented by @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the normalization as a function of @xmath38 : @xmath45 we will show soon that the inclusion of @xmath44 , has an important effect over @xmath10 .",
    "the importance of a proper treatment of the ground state normalization has been already pointed out by van neck et al .",
    "@xcite . when eq .",
    "( [ gstate ] ) is inserted into the expression of @xmath32 given by eq .",
    "( [ decw ] ) with the arbitrary selection of @xmath46 , the usual expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , are obtained .",
    "the first one comes from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ gstate ] ) , while @xmath27 results from the second term in the same equation .    alternatively ,",
    "if the @xmath31 are neglected ( _ i.e. _ @xmath47 ) , then @xmath48 and @xmath46",
    ". however , when @xmath31 are included , the use of @xmath46 means that the ground state is not properly normalized and therefore some spurious intensity is added to @xmath10 .",
    "in momentum space one model to take care of @xmath30 is by the use of a modified transition potential obtained as , ( see  @xcite ) , @xmath49 where we employ , @xmath50 with @xmath51 mev / c , as a particular correlation function in momentum space .",
    "we have limited our discussion of @xmath30 to this model and it implementation in the evaluation of @xmath10 deserves some care .",
    "we show this with an example .",
    "let us show the result of eq .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) with the central part of the parity conserving one pion exchange potential , which we write in a simplified manner as , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , is the average between the nucleon and @xmath5 masses . using this potential in eq .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) we obtain , @xmath55 by calling @xmath56 and making the approximation , @xmath57 we finally obtain , @xmath58 which is equivalent to the following general prescription to build up the modified potential due to the action of the @xmath30 : @xmath59 to the best of our knowledge , this way of taking care of @xmath30 in nuclear matter is the most frequently used one .",
    "however , we should call attention on the non - equivalence between the approximation in eq .  ( [ srcpc3 ] ) and the one in eq .  ( [ srcp ] ) for the kinematical conditions of the nonmesonic @xmath5-decay .",
    "this is because the approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ aproxlog ] ) , is a bad approximation for the momentum transfer in the @xmath60 decay channel ( where @xmath61 mev / c )",
    ". a simple numerical test shows that eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) fairly accounts for the expression given by eq .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) only for @xmath62 mev / c . for the full @xmath36-transition potential ( which includes @xmath63-dependent form factors ) ,",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) can be also performed analytically .",
    "the numerical results show that @xmath10 evaluated with the inclusion of @xmath30 given by the model in eqs .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) and ( [ cfunp ] ) , is @xmath64 smaller than the same quantity with the prescription in eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) ( employing the same @xmath65-value ) . in the present contribution we present results only for the model in eqs .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) and ( [ cfunp ] ) , as this model gives us some confidence about it applicability within a wide range in the variation of the momentum transfer .",
    "due to it frequent use , it is important to discuss the prescription in eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) , which is in fact , an approximation to the model in eqs .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) and ( [ cfunp ] ) .",
    "the employment of this prescription would be particularly questionable in the evaluation of @xmath27 ( rather than @xmath13 ) , for the reasons that follows .",
    "let us write down explicit expressions for both @xmath13 and @xmath27 .",
    "we do this in a very schematic way , @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , being @xmath70 the energy - momentum of the @xmath5 .",
    "final values for @xmath13 and @xmath27 are obtained after integrating over @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the @xmath75 and @xmath40-polarizations functions , respectively .",
    "we do not go through the derivation of these expressions ( details can be found in  @xcite , for instance ) .     and",
    "@xmath76 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we have plotted @xmath80 and @xmath81 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath63 . for simplicity ,",
    "this is done for a @xmath5 at rest ( @xmath82 ) and for @xmath83  mev / c .",
    "the behavior of @xmath80 , is a narrow function , peaked around @xmath61 mev / c .",
    "this range of variation in @xmath63 , makes the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) acceptable once @xmath65 is somehow adjusted .",
    "let us be clear : with the same @xmath65-value , the results from eq .",
    "( [ srcp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) are different because @xmath80 is non - zero far way from @xmath84 mev / c .",
    "but the narrow @xmath63-variation establish by @xmath80 , would make the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) acceptable , once the @xmath65-value is adjusted using some observable or by a comparison with a finite nucleus calculation .    from the same figure ,",
    "the situation for @xmath81 is very different as it is spread over a wide @xmath63-region . the use of eq .",
    "( [ srcpc3 ] ) would introduce a systematic error in the evaluation of @xmath27 , because due to a numerically wrong approximation , the @xmath30 are incorrectly weighed for different @xmath63-values .",
    "this warning is not restricted to our particular @xmath27-evaluation .",
    "there are two former models for the evaluation of @xmath27 .",
    "the starting point of all this evaluations ( together with the one of ours ) is the eq .",
    "( [ gam2p2h ] ) , but they differ between each other in the model for @xmath76 .",
    "the first work which has called attention on @xmath27 is the one due to alberico _",
    "@xcite , where a so - called semi - phenomenological @xmath27 has been adopted , which results from a microscopic evaluation of the polarization propagator @xmath76 in nuclear matter , originally performed for electron scattering in  @xcite . using this electron scattering calculation ,",
    "a constant @xmath85 is proposed , which is appropriate for pion absorption .",
    "thereafter , ramos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , has used also a semi - phenomenological @xmath27 , where an approximate value for the function @xmath85 , is obtained as the product of the phase space corresponding to the @xmath86-reaction , times a constant taken from pion absorption .",
    "it should be noted that in the @xmath86-reaction , all mesons are strictly off the mass shell and the employment of the pion absorption results are used as an approximation to take care of the dynamics involved in the evaluation of @xmath27 . beyond the same starting point of eq .",
    "( [ gam2p2h ] ) and the difference in the calculation of the function @xmath85 , these two works also differ from the one in  @xcite , by the way in which the isospin is taken into consideration and some minor points . in any case , the just quoted warning in the inclusion of the @xmath30 is valid for all these @xmath27-models .",
    "we turn now to the numerical results .",
    "the transition potential @xmath36 , is represented by the exchanges of the @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92-mesons , whose formulation has been taken from @xcite , and the values of the different coupling constants and cutoff parameters appearing in the transition potential have been taken from @xcite and @xcite , named as nijimegen and nsc97f , respectively .",
    "for the nuclear residual interaction @xmath43 ( which is employed in both @xmath27 and @xmath44 ) , we have used the bonn potential  @xcite in the framework of the parametrization presented in  @xcite , which contains the exchange of @xmath87 , @xmath90 , @xmath93 and @xmath91 mesons , while the @xmath88 and @xmath94-mesons are neglected . in implementing the lda ,",
    "the hyperon is assumed to be in the @xmath95 orbit of a harmonic oscillator well with frequency @xmath96 mev , where we have employed different values for the proton and neutron fermi momenta , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "the partial decay widths @xmath99 and @xmath100 have been evaluated using the scheme developed in  @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; but with the implementation of the @xmath30 described above .",
    "the @xmath27-contribution is built up to three terms : @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the dominant term is @xmath105 , where the relative magnitude of each contribution follows approximately the relation , @xmath106 .",
    "it should be noted that once the @xmath31 are considered , the partial decay widths @xmath99 and @xmath100 are multiplied by the function @xmath44 and then , the @xmath38-integration gives the final @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the action of the ground state renormalization is not the plain multiplication of @xmath107 by a constant . in this procedure",
    ", we have employed the same nuclear matter model for @xmath108 and @xmath44 , using the same nuclear residual interaction , transition potential and the @xmath30-model .    in table",
    "[ gam12 ] , we present our values for @xmath109 and @xmath10 for the two mentioned sets of transition potential parameters , with and without the action of @xmath44 . in first place , it is clear that the effect of the ground state renormalization is important : for both interactions , the spurious part in @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath110 ) , is @xmath111 . at variance , the @xmath13 without renormalization does not differ very much from @xmath10 ( @xmath112 ) with renormalization .",
    "our final @xmath10 with renormalization shows a small decrease ( increase ) with respect to @xmath13 without renormalization , for the interaction nijimegen ( nsc97f ) .",
    "in fact , while for nijimegen the value for @xmath13 is greater than the same one for nsc97f ; just the opposite occurs for @xmath27 .",
    "this is a consequence of the different weight of each spin - isospin component in each interaction , together with the different structure in the spin - isospin sums between @xmath13 and @xmath27 . as a further point for this paragraph ,",
    "our @xmath10-result for the interaction nijimegen is in close agreement with the data from  @xcite . and",
    "so does the result for the interaction nsc97f with the data from  @xcite .",
    "although both data have been included in the table , for the reasons already discussed we rely on the  @xcite data and therefore , we consider the @xmath113 value as our final result . consequently , the @xmath28-ratio takes a value 0.28 .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath27-contribution represents @xmath114 of @xmath10 and while there are many theoretical works which deals with the evaluation of @xmath13 , the same does not occur for @xmath27 .",
    "[ gam12 ]    .the nonmesonic weak decay width of @xmath0 .",
    "the first column represents the @xmath36-transition potential and the second one refers to the inclusion or not of the normalization factor in the ground state .",
    "all @xmath115 s are in units of free @xmath5-decay rate , @xmath116 ev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before going on , we give a brief overview of how the values of @xmath10 and @xmath117 are extracted from data .",
    "in first place , the hypernuclear weak decay lifetime @xmath118 , is an observable which is related to the total decay width @xmath119 , as follows , @xmath120 where @xmath121 , with @xmath122 being the mesonic decay width .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath122 is less controversial than the non - mesonic decay width , which gives us some confidence on the experimental value for @xmath10 .",
    "the extraction of the @xmath117-ratio from data is much more involved .",
    "this is because both @xmath123 and @xmath124 , are primary decays , which implies that they take place within the nucleus and can not be directly measured .",
    "the magnitudes which can be measured are the number of neutrons ( protons ) emitted as a consequence of the @xmath5-decay , denoted as @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) or also the number of neutron - neutron ( neutron - proton ) pairs , named as @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) . moreover , these numbers are measured within certain energy - intervals , which allows us to draw the particle spectra .",
    "there are several ways to connect @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "one of them is the inc , which is briefly discussed .",
    "the inc is one of the most sophisticated models to extract this ratio from data . within this model , the @xmath129-ratio",
    "is related to the @xmath117-ratio through the following relation  @xcite , @xmath130 with an analogous expression for @xmath131 .",
    "the quantities @xmath132 and @xmath133 are numerically evaluated within the inc and are independent of the weak - vertex . to extract @xmath29 from this expression one has to assume a particular value for the @xmath28-ratio .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite the results are : @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 as mentioned , the inc is one model in the data analysis . in the work done by sato et al .",
    "@xcite , it is reported @xmath138 for @xmath139 , while @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "these results are obtained by a monte - carlo simulation based on geant  @xcite and the inc from  @xcite , by fitting single - proton energy spectra and using the @xmath17-ratio as a free parameter .",
    "let us mention that in  @xcite and @xcite , a microscopic model for the spectra itself has been developed , where the primary decays @xmath123 and @xmath124 are one ingredient within the full calculation . from this point of view , it is the nucleon emission spectra , rather than the @xmath17-ratio , the magnitude which should be compared with data .    from these last two paragraphs",
    "we have tried to call attention on the fact that the accurate determination of both @xmath13 and @xmath27 are equally important .",
    "we resume now some of the more frequent approaches on this subject :    * _ only @xmath13 is evaluated , while the phase space for @xmath27 is considered , taking the @xmath28-ratio as a free parameter . _ in this case , the dynamics in @xmath27 is not evaluated .",
    "a comparison of both @xmath10 and @xmath17 with data is questionable as the @xmath27 component is arbitrarily varied to achieve the best match with data . up to now , from the experimental point of view",
    ", it is not possible to disentangle the individual magnitudes of @xmath13 and @xmath27 in @xmath10 .",
    "as the magnitude of @xmath27 is sizable compared with @xmath13 , there is no ground to avoid the explicit evaluation of @xmath27 .",
    "note that a not - null @xmath27 implies a correlated ground state , which alters the @xmath13 itself .",
    "* _ both @xmath13 and @xmath27 are evaluated in nuclear matter , without renormalization_. in this case , the problem is the simultaneous reproduction of both @xmath26 and @xmath29 . if we care about @xmath26 , the wide range of variation in the reported values for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , allows to accomplish also a good agreement with data for @xmath10 , but with wrong values for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , although the sum is correct . in this case , a small @xmath13 is compensated by some spurious intensity added by @xmath27 .",
    "this mistake is not harmless as an incorrect ratio @xmath28 would lead to a wrong analysis of data and an inappropriate choice for the transition potential parametrization , which would affect the whole theoretical calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "if we focus on @xmath29 , the theoretical @xmath10 will certainly overestimate @xmath26 . * _ the @xmath13 decay is evaluated in finite nucleus while @xmath27 in evaluated in nuclear matter_. if the renormalization is not taken into account , the objection rise in the last paragraph holds here .",
    "but the renormalization procedure is not possible in this case , because in this hybrid model ( with @xmath13 calculated in finite nucleus and @xmath27 in nuclear matter ) , there exists no partial decay width-@xmath99 .",
    "let us recall that in the renormalization procedure , each partial decay widths , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , are multiplied by the function @xmath44 , and then integrated over @xmath38 . * _",
    "both @xmath13 and @xmath27 are evaluated in finite nucleus . _ in addition , a renormalization procedure should be implemented .",
    "the problem here is that due to the huge amount of possible @xmath142-configurations , the @xmath27-evaluation is quite involved .",
    "there exists no contribution within this approach yet .",
    "as an additional comment on the second point , in  @xcite the @xmath17-ratio has been studied with a full microscopic calculation of both @xmath13 and @xmath27 , but with no renormalization .",
    "as the renormalization procedure has very little influence on the @xmath28-ratio , this analysis is still valid .",
    "however and as expected , the reported value for @xmath10 is rather big .",
    "finally , two points should be addressed .",
    "the first one refers to the transition potential .",
    "the hypernuclei decay is one of the most important source of information about baryon - baryon strangeness - changing weak interactions .",
    "therefore there is some kind of dialectical relation between the transition potential and the decay widths : there are several parametrization of the transition potential .",
    "once one parametrization is chosen as the one which gives the best value for @xmath10 ( for instance ) , this let us learn something more about the magnitude of the coupling constants in the transition potential ( note that this kind of analysis should be corroborated by the agreement between different nuclear models for the evaluation of @xmath10 ) . in this sense",
    ", it is usually argued that the tensor force in the one - pion exchange potential is too strong .",
    "the inclusion of the two - pion exchange  @xcite , provides with a strong tensor force whose sign is opposite to the one - pion one . in  @xcite , a two - pion couple to a @xmath143 and @xmath93-mesons is analyzed . in the present contribution , we have selected the transition potential as the one described as nijimegen . in principle , this choice is particular to our nuclear model for the evaluation of @xmath10 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath10 ( for a wide range of hypernucleus ) , between the just mention potential and the ones with two - pions , would certainly be of interest",
    ". however , this analysis is beyond the scope of the present contribution .    the second point which deserves attention is the calculation of single and double coincidence nucleon spectra .",
    "this would be done also in a self - consistent scheme , using the formalism developed in  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the inc can be used in two ways : one has been already discussed and it refers to the extraction of the @xmath29-ratio from the measured spectra .",
    "the other one is to start with the theoretical results for the primary decays ( @xmath144 ) and then predict a theoretical value for the spectra .",
    "this means that if the theoretical value for the spectra match exactly with the corresponding data , so does the @xmath17-ratio . in this spirit , in  @xcite and @xcite a microscopic model for the spectra has been presented . at variance with the inc ,",
    "the microscopic model naturally has some quantum - interference terms not contained in the semi - phenomenological inc model .",
    "this microscopic model is still in its preliminary stages and any improvement over the simple rpa - model of  @xcite is feasible but difficult .",
    "certainly , a good starting point is the selection for our model , of a particular parametrization of the transition potential by means of @xmath10 , which has been one of the subjects of the present work .",
    "in the present contribution we have called attention on two simple but relevant aspects in the evaluation of the nonmesonic weak decay of a @xmath5-hypernucleus .",
    "the first point is the former inappropriate way of including @xmath27 in @xmath10 .",
    "this point should not be underestimated : the plain addition of @xmath13 plus @xmath27 to obtain @xmath10 , adds spurious intensity . if there are spurious intensity , a good @xmath10-results , imply a distorted @xmath28-ratio and then , a distorted @xmath145 .",
    "the second point , refers to the implementation of @xmath30 within the kinematical conditions of the @xmath5-nonmesonic weak decay .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 has been evaluated by means of an already developed nuclear matter model , which employs the same scheme and interactions for @xmath13 and @xmath27 , but with the two improvements just mentioned . among the several parameterizations of the transition potential , with the one named as nijimegen  @xcite , it has been achieved an excellent agreement between our result for the total nonmesonic weak decay width for @xmath0 and the corresponding experimental value .",
    "this gives us a mechanism to select the transition potential which is more appropriate for our model , in view of a forthcoming calculation of the nucleon emission spectra .",
