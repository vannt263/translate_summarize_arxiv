    "within the standard model ( sm ) , the quark flavor mixing is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "the 3x3 unitary ckm matrix can be fully parametrized by four independent parameters among which a single non - vanishing complex phase accounts for the violation of the cp symmetry . +",
    "inspired from the one proposed by wolfenstein  @xcite the following parametrization , phase - convention independent and unitary - exact to all orders in @xmath2  @xcite , is used throughout this document : @xmath3 while the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 are accurately determined through the measurement of @xmath5 from the super - allowed nuclear transitions , @xmath6 from the semileptonic kaon decay and @xmath7 from the semileptonic @xmath8 decay with charm , the @xmath9 complex parameter , being the apex coordinates of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) related to the first and third quark families , is less constrained .",
    "the metrology of the ut apex via the determination of its sides and angles allows to measure the size of the cp violation and to validate the overall consistency of the km scenario within the standard model .",
    "any inconsistency would suggest contributions from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "s the ckm global fit is performed within a frequentist statistical approach including a specific treatment to handle the theoretical uncertainties on some of the inputs ( rfit  @xcite ) .",
    "the inputs used for the fit are the most recent available value of the observables from the @xmath10 and @xmath8 meson physics for which the theoretical conversion into ckm parameters is under control .",
    "the most relevant input observables of the global ckm fit , with their value and reference , are listed in the table  [ tab : inputs ] .",
    "the observable values that have been updated for this analysis with respect to the previous similar analysis  @xcite are indicated .",
    ".most relevant inputs for the global ckm fit .",
    "the left part addresses the observable inputs with their value and reference .",
    "the right part addresses the constraint on ut parameters derived from the observable .",
    "the upper part of the table contains cp - conserving observables while the cp - violating are listed in the lower part .",
    "[ tab : inputs ] [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting constraints in the ( re@xmath11,im@xmath11 ) plane are summarized in the left and right side of the figure  [ fig : np ] for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 case , respectively . for a more complete review of the constraints from the global fit of np in the b",
    "meson mixing see  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath0 meson case , the dominant constraints come from the mixing phase , @xmath12 , and the oscillation frequency @xmath13 .",
    "both reasonably agree with their sm prediction .",
    "a 2.1  @xmath14 deviation is obtained for the 2-dimensional sm hypothesis @xmath15 . the 1-dimension hypothesis based on the phase only , @xmath16=0 , corresponding the phase expectation in the standard model as well as in the minimal flavour violation scenarii , results in a 1.5  @xmath14 deviation .",
    "this slight disagreement with the sm hypothesis is essentially the translation of the tension in the sm global fit discussed in the previous section ( obviously the discrepancy in the @xmath17 leptonic decays mentionned in the previous section is unaffected by the np scenario in the @xmath0 mixing assumed here ) .",
    "+ when removing br@xmath18 observable from the fit , the deviation reduces down to 0.9  @xmath14 for both the 1d null np - phase hypothesis and the 2d sm hypothesis .",
    "the fit for new physics in the @xmath1 mixing also exhibits a 2.1  @xmath14 deviation for the sm 2d hypothesis , @xmath19 and a 2.5  @xmath14 for the 1d null np - phase hypothesis , @xmath20=0   in the fit for np in the @xmath1 mixing had previously been reported by the utfit collaboration  @xcite and has recently been updated to a lower value  @xcite ] .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath0 case , the source of the discrepancy is obvious : the deviation is fully dominated by the direct measurement by the cdf and the d0 experiments of the correlated weak mixing phase and lifetime difference , ( @xmath21 ) through the time - dependent angular analysis of the @xmath22 decay .",
    "both collaborations report a large phase with respect to the sm expectation  @xcite .",
    "the heavy flavor averaging group  @xcite obtains a 2.2  @xmath14 deviation for the sm hypothesis in the d0/cdf ( @xmath21 ) combination .",
    "the other contributions to the np fit only provide weak constraint :    * the oscillation frequency , @xmath23 , only sensitive to the module of @xmath24 is consistent with its sm prediction .",
    "* the semileptonic asymmetries , @xmath25 , and the flavor - specific proper - time , @xmath26 do not display any significant sensitivity to the np fit parameters in the current state of their determination . * the theoretical lifetime difference proportional to the cosine of the weak phase : @xmath27 slightly tends to push the np phase toward the zero value as the measured @xmath28 is larger than the sm expectation for @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the current data successfully fit the km mechanism establishing it as the dominant source of cp violation in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the current limitation of the ckm consistency tests are of three origins : lqcd quantities , the ut angle @xmath30 and the @xmath1 measurements . with the recent update of the inputs",
    ", a slight tension appears in the global ckm fit within the sm hypothesis .",
    "this tension is mainly driven by the larger br@xmath18 updated value and the smaller sin@xmath31 value that b - factories recently reported and results from a non - trivial correlation that we have explicited in the ratio br@xmath32/@xmath33 . both updates are consistent with the previous measurements but slightly go away from their sm prediction . besides the possible statistical fluctuation of the experimental measurements , further investigations are necessary to understand the role lqcd quantities may play in the origin of the tension .",
    "+ assuming the presence of new physics in the @xmath8 mixing , a model - independent fit procedure has been applied . as a translation of the observed tension in the sm ckm fit ,",
    "the sm hypothesis is 2.1  @xmath14 away from the preferred np fit solution in the @xmath0 case .",
    "a 2.1  @xmath14 deviation to sm is also observed in the @xmath1 sector , fully dominated by the direct experimental measurement of the @xmath1 mixing phase by the tevatron experiments .",
    "+ within a joint fit for np in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing , the 4-dimension sm hypothesis ( @xmath34 ) results in a 2.9@xmath14 deviation with respect to the prefered fit solution . +",
    "a more complete update with all the data eventually available at the end of the summer 2008 is to appear in  @xcite . in the near future ,",
    "significant improvements in the lattice qcd predictions as well as more precise experimental measurements can be expected in both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 sectors .",
    "these data will be scrutinized accurately to confirm or not the appearing tension in the @xmath0 sector and the large mixing phase observed in the @xmath1 mixing .",
    "eventually a major step in the consistency tests of the km mechanism will arise with the imminent lhc era and in particular with the dedicated lhcb experiment .",
