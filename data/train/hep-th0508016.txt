    "since the early eighties there has been a substantial revival of interest in quantum cosmology , motivated by the hope of obtaining a complete picture of how the universe could arise and evolve @xcite . by complete we here mean",
    "a theoretical description where , by virtue of the guiding principles of physics and mathematics , both the differential equations of the theory and the associated boundary ( and initial ) conditions are fully specified .",
    "even though modern theoretical cosmology deals with yet other deep issues such as dark matter , dark energy @xcite and cosmic strings @xcite , the effort of formulating the appropriate boundary conditions for the quantum state of the universe @xcite , or at least for its ( one - loop ) semiclassical approximation , plays again a key role , since the universe might have had a semiclassical origin @xcite , and the various orders in @xmath0 in the loop expansion describe the departure from the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "the physical motivations of our research result therefore from the following active areas of research : 0.3 cm ( i ) functional integrals and space - time approach to quantum field theory @xcite .",

    "several open problems should be brought to the attention of the reader , and are as follows . 0.3 cm ( i )",
    "we have encountered a boundary - value problem where the generalized @xmath26-function remains well defined , even though the mellin transform relating @xmath26-function to heat kernel does not exist ( see further comments below ) , since strong ellipticity is violated @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "are the spectral cancellations ( 17 ) and ( 25 ) a peculiar property of the euclidean 4-ball , or can they be extended to more general riemannian manifolds with non - empty boundary ? 0.3 cm ( ii ) what is the deeper underlying reason for finding @xmath67 ?",
    "is it possible to foresee a geometrical or topological or group - theoretical origin of this result ?",
    "0.3 cm ( iii ) is it correct to say that our positive @xmath65 value for pure gravity engenders a quantum avoidance of the cosmological singularity at one - loop level ?",
    "@xcite does the result remain true in higher - loop calculations or on using other regularization techniques for the one - loop correction ? 0.3 cm ( iv ) the whole scheme might be relevant for ads / cft in light of a profound link between ads / cft and the hartle  hawking wave function of the universe @xcite",
    ". 0.3 cm ( v ) what happens if one considers instead non - local boundary data , e.g. those giving rise to surface states for the laplacian ?",
    "@xcite 0.3 cm as far as item ( i ) is concerned , we should add what follows . the integral representation ( 11 ) of the generalized @xmath26-function",
    "is legitimate because , for any fixed @xmath16 , there is a countable infinity of roots @xmath68 and @xmath69 of eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , and they grow approximately linearly with the integer @xmath57 counting such roots .",
    "the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 admit therefore a canonical - product representation @xcite which ensures that the integral representation ( 11 ) reproduces the standard definition of generalized @xmath26-function @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "even though the mellin transform relating @xmath26-function to integrated heat kernel can not be exploited when strong ellipticity is not fulfilled , it remains possible to define a generalized @xmath26-function .",
    "for this purpose , a weaker assumption provides a sufficient condition , i.e. the existence of a sector in the complex plane free of eigenvalues of the leading symbol of the differential operator under consideration @xcite . to make sure",
    "we have not overlooked some properties of the spectrum , we have been looking for negative eigenvalues or zero - modes , but finding none . indeed , negative eigenvalues @xmath72 would imply purely imaginary roots @xmath73 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , but such roots do not exist , as one can check both numerically and analytically ; zero - modes would be non - trivial eigenfunctions belonging to zero - eigenvalues , but all modes ( tensor , vector , scalar and ghost modes ) are combinations of regular bessel functions @xcite ( since we require regularity at the origin of the left - hand side of eqs .",
    "( 1)(3 ) ) for which this is impossible .",
    "as far as we can see , we still find sources of singularities at the origin in the generalized @xmath26-function resulting from lack of strong ellipticity , but the particular symmetries of the euclidean 4-ball background reduce them to the four terms in eq .",
    "( 24 ) , which add up to zero despite two of them are non - vanishing .",
    "we have proposed to interpret the result @xmath66 for pure gravity as an indication that full diffeomorphism invariance of the boundary - value problem engenders a quantum avoidance of the cosmological singularity . indeed , on the one hand , the work by schleich @xcite had found that , on restricting the functional integral to transverse - traceless perturbations , the one - loop semiclassical approximation to the wave function of the universe diverges at small volumes , at least for the boundary geometry of a three - sphere .",
    "the divergence of the wave functional does not imply , by itself , that the probability density of the wave functional diverges at small volumes , since the probability density @xmath74 $ ] on the space of wave functionals @xmath75 $ ] is given by @xmath74=m[h]|\\psi|^{2}[h]$ ] , where @xmath76 $ ] is the measure on this space , the scaling of which is not known in general . on the other hand , in our manifestly covariant evaluation of the one - loop functional integral for the wave function of the universe , it seems incorrect to assume that the measure @xmath76 $ ] scales in such a way as to cancel exactly the contribution of the squared modulus of @xmath77 , which is proportional to the three - sphere radius raised to the power @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we find that our one - loop wave function of the universe vanishes at small volume",
    ". the normalizability condition of the wave function in the limit of small three - geometry , which is weaker than requiring it should vanish in this limit , was instead formulated and studied in @xcite .",
    "the years to come will hopefully tell us whether our calculations may be viewed as a first step towards finding under which conditions a quantum theory of gravity is singularity free in cosmology @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", it might also be interesting to study diffeomorphism - invariant boundary conditions for @xmath79 theories of gravity , recently studied at one - loop level on manifolds without boundary @xcite .",
