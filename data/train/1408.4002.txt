    "in the last decade it has become evident that for cellular behavior the mechanical environment can be as important as traditionally investigated biochemical cues @xcite . especially striking is the mechanically induced differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells ( hmscs ) cultured on elastic substrates of different elasticity @xcite . during the early stage of this mechano - guided differentiation process in hmscs ,",
    "the structure and polarization of actin - myosin stress fibers depend critically on the young s elastic modulus of the substrate and can be used as early morphological markers @xcite .",
    "an analogous study showed that also for myoblast differentiation @xcite .",
    "stress fibers are contractile structures mainly composed of actin filaments , myosin motor mini filaments ( non - muscle myosin ii s ) and distinct types of cross - linkers e.g. @xmath0-actinin , fascin , etc .. these cellular muscles are connected to the extra - cellular matrix via focal adhesions and generate and transmit forces to the outside world by pulling on the ecm proteins @xcite .",

    "description and understanding of the structure and dynamics of acto - myosin stress fibers is essential . using fluorescence microscopy",
    ", filament arrangements can be visualized where stress fibers can be considered as linear filaments of varying width and length .",
    "typical images of acto - myosin stress fibers of different quality are displayed in fig .",
    "[ image_examples ] .",
    "this poses certain challenges for a reliable extraction of all filaments location , length , width and orientation ( e.g. relative to the cell s major axis ) .",
    "in particular , studies of the dynamics of stress fibers where multiple time series of living cells are recorded in parallel over periods of 24 hours , demand a fast and reliable fiber detection algorithm .",
    "such experiments are essential towards a more detailed understanding of the role of acto - myosin cytoskeleton structure formation during the mechanically induced differentiation of hmscs @xcite .",
    "while our motivation is based on the cytoskeleton structure of hmscs , there is also demand to trace and track stress fibers over space and time in other research areas .",
    "for example , studies on migrating cells indicate @xcite various stress fiber types ( dorsal , ventral , arc ) appearing at different locations inside a migrating cell .",
    "their exact cellular function yet remains unknown but could be clarified by live cell imaging .",
    "following the filament dynamics over time gives further insight into the formation and function of stress fibers .",
    "recently , soine et al . described a novel method to analyze traction force microscopy data , so called model - based traction force microscopy @xcite . here , it is imperative to detect and mark the stress fibers of a cell to gain more insight into cellular force generation and transmission to the substrate .",
    "such live cell experiments are ideally performed for many cells in parallel to achieve sufficiently significant statistics , therefore the fiber analysis algorithm ideally performs tracing and tracking in ( nearly ) real - time .    with the filament sensor",
    "we provide such an image processing tool that yields the stress fiber structure from observations of live as well as fixed cells in terms of images with widely varying brightness , contrast , sharpness and homogeneity of fluorescence , cf .",

    "typically 30 cells are followed over a period of 24 hours with an image taken every 10 minutes .",
    "thus , the aim of real time processing allows for about 20 seconds of processing time per image .    of course , such a tool can be employed to extract filament features for any ( sets of ) images containing fiber structures .",
    "applications are conceivable in a wide range of cases especially in the context of actin fiber structures , e.g. @xcite , but also more generally in biology , medical imaging and material science .      to obtain the full information set of the stress fibers in cells , namely location , length , width , and orientation , from repeated observations of living cells under widely varying conditions in near real time demands from the _ filament sensor _ ( fs ) to extract    1 .   fast and unsupervised 2 .",

    "dealing with image inhomogeneity calls for the application of local image processing tools . blurring effects will be mitigated by line enhancement through direction sensitive methods .",
    "crossings of lines of varying intensities can be rather successfully detected by what we call _ line gaussians _ which are specific oriented thin masks , cf .",
    "[ line_severed ] .",
    "after local binarization , finally an adaption of the semilocal line sensor approach to fingerprint analysis @xcite is applied to extract all filament features .",
    "as the fs is modularized , employs local and orientation dependent image analysis methods and outputs the entire filament data , expert knowledge such as detecting fewer filaments in specific low variance areas , say , can be easily incorporated .        to assess our method",
    "we have devised two benchmark datasets .",
    "one set comprises filaments in hmscs of varying image quality , manually labeled by an expert .",
    "the second database consists of simulated fiber structures providing a test scenario with complete knowledge of spatial information .    in order to compare our new method to existing methods ( discussed in section `` results '' ) we have to restrict our comprehensive output to the limited output of others . specifically for elog ( elongated laplacian of gaussian ) method",
    "@xcite as well as for the hough transformation such limited output is given by angular histograms : accumulated pixel length of filaments per angular orientation . for the constrained inverse diffusion ( cid ) method @xcite we can only compare sets of pixels which is also possible for the elog method .",
    "a java implementation of the fs , the benchmark datasets and ground truth data , and a python script for evaluation are available under free open source and open data licenses under the project s web page http://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de/sfb755_b8 .",
    "despite the existence of a tremendous body of techniques for image processing and especially line detection ( for an overview e.g. @xcite , chapter 4 ) , currently the methods used for filament identification in cell images are often ad hoc , require partial manual processing and a fair amount of runtime , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the latter two requirements are particularly undesirable if large numbers of images are to be evaluated , as is typically the case .",
    "fundamental global methods in this context include the hough transformation @xcite and brightness thresholding via the otsu method @xcite . however , variable brightness of cell plasma and filaments demand that such methods must at least be supplemented by local methods like the laplacian of gaussian ( log , e.g. @xcite ) , anisotropic diffusion ( e.g. @xcite ) , or a beamlet approach , e.g. @xcite .",
    "many algorithms exist that focus on the analysis of networks of strongly curved microtubuli ( as opposed to the properties of single filaments ) , such as line thinning @xcite , active contours @xcite and the recently proposed constrained inverse diffusion ( cid ) method @xcite .",
    "other methods which are geared toward extraction not only of filament pixel position but also of local orientation include the fiberscore algorithm @xcite , elongated laplacians of gaussians ( elogs ) @xcite and gradient based methods @xcite .    the elog method , like the gradient method aims at detecting not only filament pixels but also their orientations . while filament length and width are not extracted , counting the number of pixels per orientation , these methods yield histograms of cumulated filament length per orientation angle which are then further analyzed @xcite .",
    "line thinning and cid identify only a skeletal filament network structure without filament orientation , length , nor width .",
    "rather , these methods are geared towards detection of thin microfilaments and not of wide stress fibers we are interested in .",
    "the cid method uses a maximum cross correlation coefficient method for templates with different orientations as a preprocessing step . while this yields considerable line enhancement in many cases , in some cases it leads to situations where bright lines sever fainter lines they cross , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ line_severed ] .",
    "certainly , this is undesirable in view of the aforementioned challenge iia .",
    "one could try to account for this by adding cross masks to the list of filters .",
    "this , however , increases the number of filters and thereby calculation time considerably ; additionally bright lines acquire a halo .",
    "the fiberscore program @xcite produces local orientation and centerline images and provides global information on accumulated line length and average width .",
    "it produces no line objects as output .",
    "it turned out that the methods applied in fiberscore did not yield optimal results for our cell images .",
    "the most important obstacle , however , for using fiberscore is that neither the program s nor its framework s source codes are freely available .",

    "the empirically determined default values proposed by the fs yield good results for most images . otherwise , starting from the default values a local optimum in the parameter space can usually be determined very quickly .",
    "tracing results are fairly weakly dependent on parameter variation in the optimal parameter region and image properties do not vary strongly over individual 24 - 48 hours time series of images with overall acceptable quality .",

    "overall , the fs performs well in terms of the challenges lined out before and often outperforms the elog and cid methods in terms of correct line pixel identification .",

    "we use the shortlist implementation @xcite of the earth mover s ( or 1st wasserstein ) distance of histograms with arc length as ground distance .",
    "because it relates masses in different bins in a natural way , this distance measure is well suited for comparison of histograms as shown by @xcite .",
    "we normalize histograms , because the canonical computation of the emd requires both histograms to have the same mass .",
    "note that this comparison disregards the effect of excess mass on shape features , the noise level , say . for a complete picture with ground truth available , however , from the illustration in the bottom rows of figs .",

    "the elog method performs slightly better than the fs on smaller cells with small ground truth mass ; those sparse histograms are very sensitive to detection errors , an effect which is damped by the large excess mass the elog method produces ;    in consequence the fs is ( on the average ) the most robust even in terms of histogram shape only , ignoring excess mass .",
    "the cid method does not aim at identifying filament orientations , furthermore , it only returns pixels along thin filament skeletons having width one . for comparison in terms of correctly identified filament pixels",
    "we thus define the following procedure .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the number of ground truth pixels for which at least one pixel identified by the method is in a @xmath75-square around it , @xmath76 the number of other ground truth pixels and @xmath77 the number of pixels detected by the method for which no ground truth pixel is in a @xmath75-square around it .",

    "consistently , elog performs best , followed by the fs , which is closely followed by cid ; this effect seems not to correlate with image quality ; 2 .   for real cells , in terms of non - detection of non - marked filament segments , consistently , cid performs best , closely ( note the logarithmic scale ) followed by the fs and further followed by elog ; this effect  which is much stronger than the one preceding  correlates negatively with image quality and once again illustrates the tendency of the elog method toward detecting consistently far too many filament pixels ; 3 .   for simulated cells ,",
    "similar effects are visible , yet on a much smaller scale , however , in terms of missing true segments , the fs outperforms cid and in terms of over - detection , the fs performs equally less optimal as elog , where the absolute rates are very low for all methods .    in summary",
    ", cid finds too little pixels and the elog finds too many while the fs achieves the balance between detecting too many and too little filament pixels .      using an orientational grid of @xmath36 angles , elog takes more than @xmath38 minutes per image compared to approximately @xmath38 seconds for the fs and for ht ( these runtimes have been observed on a single core 1.73 ghz intel celeron with 2 gb ram ) .",
    "in contrast , the cid method required more than 20 hours ( running on an amd opteron 6140 with 32 cores at 2.6 ghz and 128 gb ram ) .",
    "the disparity of runtimes is illustrated in table [ table ] .",
    "the comparatively short runtime in connection with the semi - automated nature of its workflow ( fast , uninterrupted batch processing ) thus makes the fs a viable tool for analyzing the actin cytoskeleton via time series of live cell images .",
    "especially , as @xmath81 images are taken every @xmath66 minutes in our setup , the fs can analyze the full filament structure of images almost in real time .",
    "this can not be achieved with any of the existing methods .",
    "a future application in terms of automatic microscopy and real time stress fiber analysis is thus conceivable .",
    "we have developed the filament sensor ( fs ) that allows for nearly real time and semi - automated extraction of straight filament structures in microscope images , in particular from live human mesenchymal stem cells ( hmscs ) .",
    "reliable extraction of the entire filament data is essential for a better understanding and future modelling of the complex mechano - sensing phenomena e.g. for detailed statistical studies of the relationship between matrix elasticity and early mechano - guided differentiation of hmscs or myoblast differentiation @xcite . in view of live cell imaging , approximately 4000 images ( 30 cells followed over 24 hours with an image every 10 minutes )",
    "need to be processed per day . to the knowledge of the authors ,",
    "no method has previously been available for this task ( even without extracting the entire filament structure , the conventional elog method would require 60 days for this , cid almost 10 years ) .",
    "we have provided for a proof of concept by checking against a database of filaments manually marked by a human expert and a simulated database .",
    "moreover , we have compared our fs against three other methods , the output of which , however , encompasses only a small portion of the entire filament data we are interested in . in this comparison",
    ", the fs performs best in terms of histogram mass and histogram distances and takes a middle ground between false positives ( where , for real cells , elog is best and cid is worst ) and false negatives ( where , for real cells , cid is best and elog is worst ) .    in terms of speed",
    ", the fs overwhelmingly outperforms all competitors .",
    "while the ht would require additional tracing , elogs are slower by a factor of more than @xmath82 and cid by a factor of more than @xmath83 ( on a stronger machine ) .",
    "clearly the latter is beyond any acceptable runtime for the processing of thousands of images we are aiming at .",
    "in summary , recalling goals i ) , ii ) and iii ) from section `` the filament sensor and the benchmark dataset '' , the fs is the first tool available to extract complete filament data from hmscs images ( goal iii ) , unsupervised in near real time ( goal i ) that is equally or more robust ( goal ii ) than slower competitors with more limited output .    at the end of this exposition",
    "we would like to point out two challenges we leave for future work .    1 .",
    "as the fs starts finding wide lines first and then proceeds to thinner lines , it will sometimes detect lines of variable width as several pieces with different width .",
    "these line fragments could be matched to produce a single long line .",
    "a future version of the fs may include slightly curved stress fibers and a correspondingly appropriate matching procedure .",
    "we plan to explore the application of curved gabor filters @xcite for detecting curved stress fibers and for coping with fiber crossings .",
    "recently , gabor wavelets have proved to be beneficial for a similar application in retinal vessel tracking @xcite .",
