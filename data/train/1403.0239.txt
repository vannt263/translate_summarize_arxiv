    "<S> designing thermoelectric materials with high figure of merit @xmath0 requires fulfilling three often irreconcilable conditions , i.e. , the high electrical conductance @xmath1 , small thermal conductance @xmath2 and high seebeck coefficient @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> these systems , acting as a two - dimensional topological insulator with robust helical edge states carrying electrical current , yield a highly optimized power factor @xmath4 per helical conducting channel . </S>",
    "<S> concurrently , their array of nanopores impedes the lattice thermal conduction through the bulk . using quantum transport simulations coupled with first - principles electronic and phononic band structure calculations , the thermoelectric figure of merit </S>",
    "<S> is found to reach its maximum @xmath5 at @xmath6 k. this paves a way to design high-@xmath7 materials by exploiting the nontrivial topology of electronic states through nanostructuring .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    thermoelectrics  @xcite transform temperature gradients into electric voltage and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> although a plethora of thermoelectric energy harvesting and cooling applications has been envisioned , their usage is presently limited by their small efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that increasing thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath8 requires careful trade - off between electrical conductance @xmath1 , the seebeck coefficient @xmath3 , and the thermal conductance @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the total thermal conductance has contributions from both electrons @xmath10 and phonons ( i.e. , lattice vibrations ) @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 quantifies the maximum efficiency of a thermoelectric cycle conversion in the linear - response regime where a small voltage exactly cancels the current induced by the small temperature difference at average operating temperature @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the values approaching @xmath13 would ensure carnot efficiency as the theoretical limit for a heat engine operating between a hot @xmath14 and a cold @xmath15 temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath7 of realistic devices is limited by irreversible energy losses via joule heat and thermal conduction , so that a pragmatic goal is to achieve with low parasitic losses and stability over a broad temperature range  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the major directions to increase @xmath7 have been focused on either materials with high power factor @xmath4 , such as doped narrow - gap semiconductors ; or on minimizing @xmath11 by enhanced phonon scattering in different frequency ranges , such as through nanostructuring  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although nanostructuring has progressed rapidly over the past decade  @xcite , it typically affects bulk electronic states of conventional materials in unfavorable way for thermoelectricity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the recently discovered topological insulator ( ti ) materials  @xcite are of particular interest . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient in this new class of materials is strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) which opens an energy gap @xmath16 in the bulk and generates conducting edge ( in two dimensions ) or surface ( in three - dimensions ) electron states robust against backscattering off nonmagnetic disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , bi@xmath17te@xmath18 as one of the prime examples of 3d tis  @xcite is well - known to be one of the best bulk thermoelectrics with @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent efforts have demonstrated how using nanocomposites of bulk and thin film bi@xmath17te@xmath18 can lead to @xmath20  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these findings relies on the topological surface states whose contribution to @xmath3 and @xmath1 would be insensitive to disorder introduced to suppress @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the very recent attempts to design thermoelectrics based on three - dimensional  @xcite ( 3d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite tis are mostly qualitative and lack information on their phonons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , many candidate 3d ti materials are unintentionally doped in the bulk which makes difficult to reach the topological transport regime where electrons , behaving as massless dirac fermions , propagate exclusively on their surfaces  @xcite .        in this article </S>",
    "<S> we present a theoretical design of a high-@xmath7 system , using graphene - based 2d ti nanowire depicted in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a much simpler system  graphene with randomly distributed heavy adatoms  has been conjectured recently via first - principles studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , among many possible heavy adatoms indium and thallium favor high - symmetry position in the center of the hexagons of honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms , while being nonmagnetic and without inducing rashba soc that would compete with the emergence of the 2d ti phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two types of graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) + nanopores as the central region of the two - terminal setup in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) , where the edge of gnr is either perfectly ordered and chosen to be of zigzag type in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) , or lightly disordered in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath22% of gnr hexagons are randomly selected and covered by heavy adatoms of indium , which locally enhance  @xcite tiny ( due to lightness of carbon atoms ) intrinsic soc coupling  @xcite already present in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this helps to increase the bulk band gap from  @xcite in pristine graphene to for the chosen adatom type and @xmath23 .        </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , despite completely random position of heavy adatoms , such disordered system has extremely stable 2d ti phase ( which is actually stabilized by the randomness of adatom distribution  @xcite ) that does not require disorder averaging  @xcite because each sample has the same bulk energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> the gap is visible in the dos in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](d ) which , together with the local dos in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) and related spatial profile of local charge currents in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](b ) ( both of which are confined around the gnr edges ) , do not contain any signatures of spatial inhomogeneities .    </S>",
    "<S> due to time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , the edge currents can not be reduced by interior nonmagnetic impurities and vacancies , or by edge disorder like the one introduced in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to quantized zero - bias electronic transmission function @xmath24 in the landauer - bttiker approach to quantum transport  @xcite , shown in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig1](b ) and  [ fig : fig1](c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the quantized value @xmath25 reflects ballistic transport of electrons through one - dimensional counter - propagating and spin - polarized edge states , often labeled as `` helical ''  @xcite , where trs forces electrons of opposite spin to flow in opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of spin - polarized conducting channels on both edges is four , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) , where electrons in two of these channels moving in the same direction give @xmath25 ( which was also employed as the experimental signature of 2d ti phase in the early experiments  @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) and  [ fig : fig2](d ) plots @xmath25 within a wider range of energies for a uniform zgnr + heavy - adatoms , which is inherited from the underlying subband structure of gnrs with zigzag edges ( zgnrs )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , once nanopores and/or edge disorder are introduced the quantized @xmath25 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) and  [ fig : fig2](d ) persists only when the fermi energy ( whose position can be controlled by the gate voltage ) is within the bulk gap @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the quantization of @xmath26 due to protection of helical edge states by trs occurs in a range of energies smaller than the navely expected . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the width of non - zero ldos around edges in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](a ) increases as one moves away from the dirac point ( dp ) at @xmath27 , so that when states from opposite edges start to overlap a minigap is created thereby removing the crossing point in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1](a ) and protection by trs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although no symmetry prevents inelastic backscattering off phonons , quantized transmission is expected to be insensitive to such inelastic mechanisms to leading order  @xcite .        </S>",

    "<S> also determine  @xcite electronic charge and thermal conductance . at low temperatures ( @xmath29 ) , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> can be approximated  @xcite by the so - called mott formula which explicitly shows that large values of @xmath3 , plotted in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](e ) and  [ fig : fig2](f ) , require steep variation of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs around in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](c ) or in fig .  [ fig : fig2](d ) , where the details of the steep change from @xmath30 to a vanishing value are also controlled by the nanopores and/or edge disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - like ( for ) and hole - like ( for ) transport give contributions to @xmath3 of opposite sign , so that @xmath31 exactly at the dp ( as observed in the experiments on large - area graphene  @xcite ) .    while low also helps to increase @xmath3 , its large values too far away from the dp are irrelevant because thermoelectric performance depends  @xcite on the power factor @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath4 shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2](e ) and  [ fig : fig2](f ) has exactly the same shape as the one obtained from the mahan - sofo ( ms ) mechanism  @xcite based on , which ensures and also sets putative  @xcite upper limit on . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2](e ) and  [ fig : fig2](f ) is larger than the corresponding obtained  @xcite in the ms mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> thus , 2d ti nanowires utilize their two spin - polarized edge conducting channels most efficiently for thermoelectricity , which can be traced back to the ( approximate ) boxcar functional shape  @xcite of @xmath26 in figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig2](c ) and  [ fig : fig2](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> although only two available conducting channels make the total power factor of a single graphene - based 2d ti nanowire minuscule compared to bulk 3d materials  @xcite , quantities shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] do not scale with the wire width so that one can substantially increase the total @xmath4 by patterning very large number of very narrow gnrs connected in parallel .    </S>",
    "<S> the phononic band structure in fig .  [ fig : fig3](b ) for graphene supercell with indium adatoms and soc switched on is computed from first - principles using vasp simulation package  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this serves as in input for quantum transport calculation of the phononic transmission function @xmath32 , plotted in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](c ) and  [ fig : fig3](d ) , and @xmath21 in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> they are mutually connected through the landauer - type formula  @xcite @xmath33 the very high debye temperature ( @xmath34 k ) of graphene necessitates quantum transport treatment of phonon propagation captured by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> however , this formula does not take into account the resistive umklapp phonon - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , such effect is expected to be irrelevant for gnrs depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] because their width is much smaller than the mean - free path due to phonon - phonon scattering ( e.g. , or at room temperature for graphene freely suspended or lying on sio@xmath17 substrate , respectively  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the thermal conductivity of freely suspended large - area graphene at room temperature is among the highest of any known material  @xcite , it decreases significantly when this 2d material is in contact with a substrate or confined into nanoribbons . </S>",
    "<S> we further reduce the ballistic value of @xmath21 for gnrs , plotted as dotted line in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3](e ) and  [ fig : fig3](f ) , by _ two orders _ of magnitude via introduction of nanopores , as demonstrated by solid line in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows dependence of the peak values of @xmath7 on temperature . ]    in summary , using quantum transport modeling combined with first - principles electronic and phononic band structure calculations we designed _ in silico _ a high-@xmath7 thermoelectric where graphene nanoribbons with arbitrary shaped edges and nanopores in their interior are covered with heavy adatoms of indium . </S>",
    "<S> the adatoms provide sufficiently strong local soc in some fraction of randomly chosen hexagons , so that such inhomogeneous soc opens both the bulk band gap ( for @xmath22% of hexagons covered ) and generates topologically protected helical edge states . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic transmission through helical edge states in the form of the ( approximate ) boxcar function of width @xmath43 generates power factor @xmath4 per conducting channel which is actually larger than the one obtained from the celebrated mahan - sofo mechanism using delta function transmission . </S>",
    "<S> this feature combined with two orders of magnitude reduction of phononic thermal conductance by the nanopores leads to the thermoelectric figure of merit for this system @xmath5 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> since the existing bulk thermoelectric materials are very inefficient at low operating temperatures @xmath44 k where they give @xmath45  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , ti - based high-@xmath7 thermoelectrics at low temperatures designed by our study are very attractive for applications like radioisotope thermoelectric generators on spacecrafts or cooling of electronic satellite components .    although bulk materials are deemed necessary for large - scale power generation  @xcite , gnrs underlying our proposal are single - atom - thick and with electronic transport properties which do not scale with their width , so that very high packing density  @xcite of gnrs connected in parallel is possible within a 3d volume . </S>",
    "<S> other choices  @xcite for heavy adatoms include os , ir and cu - os or cu - ir dimers , which could generate larger gap @xmath46 ev using smaller adatom coverage @xmath47% ( via different hybridization mechanism between carbon and adatom orbitals than in the case of indium or thallium ) , thereby making it possible to also tune the optimal operating temperature . </S>",
