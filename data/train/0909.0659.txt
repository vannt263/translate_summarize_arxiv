    "since the theory of solitons has very wide applications in fluid dynamics , nonlinear optics , biochemistry , microbiology , physics and many other fields , the study of soliton solutions has become one of the important issues of nonlinear partial differential equations @xcite-@xcite .    in 1999 , degasperis and procesi @xcite derived a nonlinear dispersive equation @xmath0 which is called the degasperis - procesi equation . here @xmath1 represents the fluid velocity at time @xmath2 in the @xmath3 direction in appropriate nondimensional units ( or , equivalently the height of the water s free surface above a flat bottom ) .",
    "the nonlinear convection term @xmath4 in eq.([eq1.1 ] ) causes the steepening of wave form , whereas the nonlinear dispersion effect term @xmath5 in eq.([eq1.1 ] ) makes the wave form spread .",
    "eq.([eq1.1 ] ) can be regarded as a model for nonlinear shallow water dynamics @xcite .",
    "an important issue regarding the degasperis - procesi equation is to find its traveling wave solutions .",
    "vakhnenko and parkes @xcite derived periodic and solitary wave solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "matsuno @xcite-@xcite obtained multisoliton , @xmath6-soliton , cusp and loop soliton solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "lundmark and szmigielski @xcite investigated multi - peakon solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "shock wave solutions of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) were obtained in @xcite .",
    "lenells @xcite classified all its weak traveling wave solutions . chen and tang",
    "@xcite showed that eq.([eq1.1 ] ) has kink - like and antikink - like wave solutions .",
    "qiao @xcite obtained the peakons , dehisced solitons , cuspons and new 1-peak solitons of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) .",
    "it is known that the degasperis - procesi equation has solitons , but has no kink or antikink solutions . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the degasperis - procesi equation to the following 2-component of degasperis - procesi equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "this 2-component of the degasperis - procesi equation can be applied to describe shallow water waves . in eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) , @xmath9 denotes the height of the water surface above a horizontal bottom and @xmath10 is related to the horizontal velocity field .",
    "obviously , if @xmath11 , then eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) is reduced to the degasperis - procesi equation ( [ eq1.1 ] ) . using the bifurcation theory of planar dynamical systems ( see @xcite ) , we will show that , in addition to smooth solitons , eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) has kink and antikink solutions .",
    "the solitons denote the nonlinear localized waves on the shallow water s free surface that retain their individuality under interaction and eventually travel with their original shapes and speeds .",
    "the kink and antikink waves , which rise or descend from one asymptotic state to another , form another type .",
    "the balance between the nonlinear steepening and dispersion effect under eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) gives rise to these solutions .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper may help people to know deeply the described physical process of eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the traveling wave transformation , we transform eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) into a planar dynamical system and then discuss bifurcations of phase portraits of this system . in section 3 , we obtain the expressions for the smooth soliton , kink and antikink solutions of eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) .",
    "a short conclusion is given in section 4 .",
    "eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) also takes the form @xmath12    let @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wave speed . by using the traveling wave transformation @xmath15 , @xmath16 , we reduce system ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to the following ordinary differential equations : @xmath17    integrating ( [ eq2.2 ] ) once with respect to @xmath18 , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 are two integral constants .    from the second expression in system ( [ eq2.3 ] ) , we can obtain that @xmath21    substituting ( [ eq2.4 ] ) into the first expression in system ( [ eq2.3 ] ) yields    @xmath22    let @xmath23 , then we get the following planar dynamical system : @xmath24 this system has a first integral @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .    note that ( [ eq2.6 ] ) has a singular line @xmath27 . to avoid the line temporarily ,",

    "eq.([eq2.6 ] ) becomes @xmath29    system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) and system ( [ eq2.8 ] ) have the same first integral as ( [ eq2.7 ] ) .",
    "consequently , system ( [ eq2.8 ] ) has the same topological phase portraits as system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) except for the straight line @xmath27",
    ".    for a fixed @xmath26 , ( [ eq2.7 ] ) determines a set of invariant curves of system ( [ eq2.8 ] ) . as @xmath26",
    "is varied , ( [ eq2.7 ] ) determines different families of orbits of system ( [ eq2.8 ] ) having different dynamical behaviors .",

    "that it is impossible to figure out the equilibrium points of system ( [ eq2.8 ] ) for arbitrary constants @xmath14 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , so here for the sake of convenience , we set @xmath41 . by using the first integral value and properties of equilibrium points , we obtain the bifurcation curves as follows : @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 obviously",

    "usually , a soliton solution of eqs.([eq1.2 ] ) corresponds to a homoclinic orbit of system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) and a kink ( or an antikink ) solution of eq.([eq1.1 ] ) corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit ( or the so - called connecting orbit ) of system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) .    in fig.[fig1](c ) , ( d ) , ( f ) , the homoclinic orbits of system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) or ( [ eq2.8 ] ) can be expressed respectively as @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 is as in ( [ eq2.16 ] ) .    substituting eq.([eq3.1])-([eq3.3 ] ) into the first equation of system ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , respectively , and integrating along the corresponding homoclinic orbit , we have @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 it follows from ( [ eq3.10])-([eq3.12 ] ) that @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are as in ( [ eq3.4 ] ) , ( [ eq3.5 ] ) , ( [ eq3.6 ] ) , ( [ eq3.7 ] ) , ( [ eq2.16 ] ) and ( [ eq3.9 ] ) , respectively .",
