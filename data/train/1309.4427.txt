    "a system that exhibits good mobility of localized modes may be promising for the design of all - optical networks , where mobility can help to implement fast switching and transfer of signals across the system .    in this work we focus on the existence and stability of mobile fundamental localized modes , both odd and even ones ( alias on - site and off - site - centered states , respectively ) , in the discrete nls ( dnls ) equation with cq on - site nonlinearities .",
    "first , we develop an analytical approach predicting , with the help of the variational approximation ( va ) , the _ mobility threshold _ in this model ; i.e. , the largest value of the total power ( alias norm ) of the discrete soliton admitting its progressive motion induced by the initial kick .",
    "the threshold is predicted by equating the largest possible value if effective kinetic energy of the kicked soliton to the height of the corresponding peierls - nabarro ( pn ) barrier .",

    "the va - based prediction describes qualitatively correctly too fast suppression of the mobility of the discrete solitons with the increase of the self - focusing quintic nonlinear term . in the case of the competing combination of the self - focusing cubic and defocusing quintic terms",
    ", we emphasize the crucial role played by regions of the stability exchange between the odd and even fundamental modes , and by intermediate asymmetric modes existing in those regions , for the understanding of the _ spontaneous mobility _ featured by solitons which are unstable in the static state .",
    "we also study the mobility of stable discrete solitons under the action of the kick .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the model with the competing focusing - defocusing cq terms is considered , in the numerical form , in section v. in this section , points of the stability exchange between the odd and even fundamental localized modes are analyzed at first , due to the specific role which , as said above , they play in the transition of unstable solitons into the state of spontaneous motion .",
    "the dynamical regimes proper , both of the spontaneous motion for originally unstable discrete modes , and the motion of kicked stable solitons , are presented in that section too , along with basic results for collisions between moving discrete solitons .",

    "exponentially localized solutions for discrete solitons exist outside of the linear band , and they can be obtained by solving the following set of real coupled algebraic equations : @xmath22 by means of the high - confinement approximation  @xcite , we construct an initial condition which is very close to an exact localized solution .",
    "then , we implement an iterative multidimensional newton - raphson method to find a numerical solution for a given frequency @xmath14 or power @xmath23 ( both parameters can be used independently to find solutions ) .",

    "hereafter , stable and unstable solutions are plotted by means of solid and dashed lines , respectively .    in the framework of this work ,",
    "we focus on typical fundamental modes that are relevant to understand the dynamical properties of collective excitations in this type of lattices .",
    "accordingly , we will call an _ odd mode _ the one centered at one site of the lattice , while the _ even mode _ is centered between two lattice sites .",
    "other frequently used names for these two species of the localized states are , respectively , on - site - centered and off - site - centered modes . the quantity which unequivocally identifies the species is the center - of - mass coordinate , defined as @xmath27 odd and even modes",

    "indeed , for a given power ( norm ) , this difference determines effective energetic barriers for moving the discrete soliton across the lattice : to move the odd mode a single site across the lattice , it needs to be transformed into even mode and , again , to the odd mode centered at the next site .",
    "thus , the energy required for this transformation must be at least equal to the energy difference between the two states , keeping the power constant ( in the case of the adiabatic movement ) .",
    "it is worthy to mention that different nonlinear interactions generate diverse energy landscapes .",
    "for example , a photorefractive saturable dnls model  @xcite allows the existence of a single stability region for any fundamental solution , and regions of multi - stability where intermediate asymmetric solutions appear .",
    "the continuous exchange of stability properties is accompanied by several crossings of the hamiltonian values , generating diverse regions where the mobility is enhanced , even for high powers .",

    "this cubic model possesses a single region of simultaneously unstable solutions , where the stable solution becomes the intermediate one .",
    "good mobility occurs in the exchange regions , where hamiltonian values approach and cross each other .    in this connection , it is also relevant to mention a very recent result for 2d cubic kagome lattices  @xcite . for that model",

    ", the odd modes do not have enough energy to overcome the pn barrier .",
    "thus , the unstable odd modes oscillate in the interval of @xmath119 without being able to cross the barrier .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] displays the evolution of @xmath110 for several unstable odd modes , all with @xmath120 . as the instability growth rate @xmath24 increases , following the increase of the total power , the amplitude of the spontaneous oscillations increases too , because the value of @xmath114 for the odd mode approaches that for the even one .",

    ", the odd mode is able to overcome the pn barrier and move across the lattice . figure  [ fig12 ] shows the evolution of three different unstable odd - mode solutions for three different levels of the total power .",
    "we observe that the transversal velocity of the spontaneous motion is correlated to the power ; for example , in case ( c ) the velocity almost doubles in comparison with case ( a ) . for an increasing power ,",
    "the value of @xmath114 for the odd mode increases in comparison to the even mode .",
    "therefore , the kinetic energy for this mode is larger , letting it move faster across the lattice .",
    "center2mat.eps ( 17,64 ) ( 46,64 ) ( 75,64 )    we proceed to exploring the next stability - exchange region , located around @xmath122 . here , both fundamental solutions are stable and both correspond to minima of the hamiltonian , without starting spontaneous motion .",
    "therefore , a kick must be applied to these modes to help them overcome the energy barriers .",

    "some the kicked discrete solitons come to a halt ( see the upper inset ) , getting trapped between two sites of the lattice , while others continue the persistent motion .",

    "[ fig13 ] also shows that the discrete solitons with smaller total powers initially move faster than ones with greater powers .",
    "this feature can be easily explained by the comparison with the nls equation in continuum , where the kick measures the momentum imparted to the soliton , while the total power determines its mass , hence the heavier soliton moves slower , under the action of the same kick .",
    "the difference in the mobility between the lighter and heavier solitons , kicked with the same strength , is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , where the soliton field is displayed on the logarithmic scale : the shape distortion , manifested by the generation of radiation tails , is greater for lighter solitons [ fig .",

    "the stronger kicked mode , with @xmath131 , changes the direction of its velocity , and keeps moving almost at the same velocity as the other mode , which was kicked by @xmath132 .",
    "finally , when the two modes are kicked by @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the interaction between them looks as a _ signal - blocker pair _",

    "the analytical part of the work was based on the va ( variational approximation ) , with the aim to estimate the mobility threshold , i.e. , the largest value of the discrete - soliton s total power ( norm ) which admits free motion of the kicked soliton .",
    "this was done by comparing the largest possible value of the soliton s effective kinetic energy with the height of the pn potential barrier .",
    "it is relevant to stress that this analytical prediction is novel also for the usual dnls equation with the purely cubic nonlinearity .",
    "the prediction was found to be in a reasonable agreement with numerical results .",
    "in addition , this analytical estimate qualitatively predicts that the increase of the coefficient in front of self - focusing quintic term quickly suppresses the mobility . in the dnls model with competing self - focusing and defocusing cq terms ,",
    "we have identified , by means of the numerical analysis , regions in the parameter space where even and odd fundamental modes exchange their stability , which involves the appearance of intermediate asymmetric modes . in this case ,",
    "stable solitons are kicked to overcome the pn barrier and get in a state of persistent motion . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been demonstrate by means of direct simulations that unstable solitons start progressive motion spontaneously , provided that they initially exist above the mobility threshold .",
    "finally , collisions between stable moving discrete solitons were considered , and three different scenarios identified for them .",
    "the analysis reported here may be extended in other directions .",
    "in particular , it may be interesting to consider possible mobility of excited ( non - fundamental ) localized states , such as twisted modes  @xcite .",
