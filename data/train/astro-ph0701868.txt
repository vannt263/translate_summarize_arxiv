    "at the end of july 2006 , the source displayed an anomalously high activity .",
    "preliminary analysis of the hess data showed an average flux level of @xmath16  crab in the @xmath1  gev energy band with flares up to @xmath0  crab during the night of @xmath17  july , an average flux level of @xmath18  crab during the night of @xmath19  july with smaller activity , while a second outburst occurred in the night of @xmath20  july with an average of @xmath21  crab and flares up to @xmath22  crab ( raue et al .",

    "2006 ) some high - energy satellites pointed at pks  2155304 .    the _ swift _ satellite ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) performed optical / uv and x - ray follow - up , starting on july  @xmath23 ending on august  @xmath23 2006 , with repeated short exposure pointings . here",
    "we present the results of these observations , a comparison with previous ones , when pks  2155304 was in a low activity state and theoretical modeling of the seds .",
    "the data from the three instruments onboard _ swift _ have been processed and analyzed with ` heasoft v. 6.1.2 ` with the latest calibration files ( 6 december 2006 ) .",
    "data from individual pointings from the coded - mask hard x - rays detector bat ( optimized for the @xmath24  kev energy band , barthelmy et al .",
    "2005 ) were binned , cleaned from hot pixels and background , and deconvolved .",
    "the intensity images were then integrated by using the variance as weighting factor .",
    "pks  2155304 was not detected either in individual pointings nor in the integrated mosaic image .",
    "the upper limit for a @xmath25 detection in the @xmath26  kev energy band  already corrected for systematics ",

    "data from the x - ray telescope xrt ( @xmath2  kev , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) were analyzed using the ` xrtpipeline ` task .",
    "xrt automatically switches the operating mode according to the target source flux , changing from window timing ( wt , high flux ) to photon counting ( pc , low flux ) with a threshold around @xmath18  mcrab ( @xmath34  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 ) . the x - ray flux of pks  2155304 remained almost always above @xmath35  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : swiftlc ] ) and therefore we analyzed only the window timing mode data .",
    "there are also a few hundreds of seconds exposure in photon counting mode , but the point - spread function ( psf ) is severely affected by pile - up .",
    "nevertheless , we used the source position measured in the images accumulated with pc data as best input for the pipeline of wt mode ( without imaging ) .",
    "we selected only the grade 0 ( single pixel ) events and extracted the spectra only from pointings with exposures greater than @xmath36  s , in order to have the best available statistics .",
    "the remaining pointings ( i.e. with less than @xmath36  s ) are anyway included in the lightcurve displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : swiftlc ] , in order to give a better coverage of the time evolution of the source .    since most of the pointings lasted a few hundreds of seconds , there exposure is insufficient to have data at energies above @xmath37  kev , except for the pointing of 29 july , where a @xmath21  ks exposure allowed us to have useful signal up to @xmath16  kev .",
    "in addition , the xrt response is limited at low energies , because there are still some residual instrumental feature around @xmath38  kev ( campana et al .",
    "therefore , the extracted spectra were fitted in the range @xmath39  kev and from @xmath40 to @xmath41  kev , depending on the statistics and then the flux was measured in the full @xmath2  kev band .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table : swiftlog ] .",
    "for xrt , we note that the observation indicated in table  [ table : swiftlog ] as `` 29/31 - 07 '' actually started on @xmath23  july  @xmath29 at @xmath42  utc and ended on @xmath43  july  @xmath29 at @xmath44  utc , resulting in an elapsed time of @xmath45  s. however , the effective exposure time is only @xmath46  s. thus , the spectral data reported in table  [ table : swiftlog ] refer to the average of the snapshot observations during this period . in addition , we also extracted from this observation , the subset of data referring only to the night between 29 and 30 july , in order study the data available that are simultaneous to tev observations .",

    "data from the optical / uv telescope uvot ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) were analyzed by using the ` uvotmaghist ` task with a source region of @xmath47 for optical and @xmath48 for uv filters .",
    "the background was extracted from an annular region centered on the source and with an inner region equal to the source region plus @xmath49 and the outer radius equal to @xmath50 . to take into account systematic effects",

    "[ fig : swiftlc ] .    in order to compare x - rays / uv / optical data close to the outburst with data when pks  2155304 was not active ( i.e. with low x - ray / uv / optical fluxes ) , we retrieved and analyzed _ swift _ observations of the blazar performed in april @xmath29 .",
    "the results of the analysis are reported in table  [ table : swiftlog ] where the flux difference between april and august observations shows up clearly .",
    "the _ swift _ observations of pks  @xmath53 starting on july 29th at @xmath54 during the phase of strong tev activity reported by hess ( raue et al .",
    "2006 , aharonian et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , show an initial increase of the x - ray flux , by a factor 4 , between the observation of 29 july and that of 30 july followed by an overall decrease , while optical / uv fluxes show a moderate activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : swiftlc2 ] ) .",
    "no detection in hard x - rays was obtained with bat .    with respect to the april 2006 observations ,",
    "xrt recorded a change by a factor @xmath21 , while the uv flux increased by a factor of @xmath55 . for comparison",
    "the hess observations of july 2006 showed `` night - averaged '' intensities in the tev band of factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 larger than those in @xmath58 ( @xmath38  crab ; aharonian et al .",
    "2005 ) , but with short flares of up to a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "the sparseness of the available data does not allow us to make stringent correlations with tev data .",
    "we note however that the initial flare in x - rays taking place between the nights of 29 and 30 july , approximately coincides with the second tev outburst , while a lower amplitude flare in the uv occurs about one day later ( fig .",
    "[ fig : swiftlc2 ] ) .",
    "since the uvot detector often saturated because of coincidence losses , we can not exclude the occurrence of other flares with greater amplitude .      with the current data set we can not probe the short ( 5 min ) timescale variability preliminarily reported by hess ( raue et al .",
    "2006 ; aharonian et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , but can investigate only quantities averaged over timescales of days .",
    "we therefore assembled the spectral energy distribution ( sed , fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) using the _ swift _ observation tagged as `` 30 july '' that is quasi - simultaneous to the second tev flare occurred during the night between @xmath20 july 2006 .",
    "we also considered tev and _ swift _ observations performed on 2 august , when the blazar activity was declining .    in order to discuss the observed seds in terms of changes of relevant physical quantities",
    ", we used the model by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to reproduce the seds in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "as generally assumed for this and the other tev bl lacs ( e.g. aharonian 2004 ) the x - ray emission is attributed to synchrotron radiation and the @xmath60ray component to the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process .",
    "the source is assumed to be a sphere of radius @xmath61 travelling with bulk lorentz factor @xmath62 at an angle @xmath63 with respect to the line of sight , yielding a doppler factor @xmath64 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath65 is tangled and homogeneous .",
    "the distribution of emitting relativistic electrons is computed as the result of a broken power law injection distribution @xmath66 between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and @xmath69 below @xmath67 , subject to radiative cooling occurring in a light crossing time @xmath70 .",
    "this injection of relativistic particles correspond to an injected power @xmath71 as measured in the comoving frame .",
    "the resulting particle distribution @xmath72 is formed by power law segments , the steepest of which is @xmath73 .",
    "all the parameters corresponding to the two models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] are listed in table  [ param ] .",
    "tavecchio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that , in principle , if the peak frequencies and fluxes of the synchrotron and self  compton components and the variability timescales are known , then the main parameters for the ssc model are determined . at present",
    "we have only a very partial knowledge of the sed at high energies , resulting in ambiguities in the parameter choice . to fix them , we minimized the luminosity in the self ",
    "compton component assuming an intrinsically steep tev spectrum .",
    "we have also assumed that the variability timescales is @xmath741 hour , as typically observed in the x  ray band ( e.g. zhang et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the much shorter 5 minute variability timescale recently observed in the tev band should then imply a different additional region / emission process .",
    "the model results show that , while there is some evidence of a flatter x - ray spectrum at higher intensity , the frequency of the sychrotron peak remains at @xmath75  hz , consistent with other observations with much weaker tev activity ( cf urry et al .",
    "1997 , chiappetti et al . 1999 , foschini et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the low peak frequency value is also a result of the choice of reproducing the optical - uv fluxes .",
    "the large difference in tev fluxes associated with small differences in x - ray spectra requires , in ssc models , an increase of the relativistic electrons accompanied by a decrease of the magnetic field .",
    "the above point is confirmed by a comparison of the present data and model with the _ bepposax _ observation in november @xmath76 ( chiappetti et al .",
    "1999 ) which was performed quasi - simultaneously to the tev observations by chadwick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , when pks  2155304 was at about @xmath77  crab ( average flux , @xmath10  gev ) .",
    "with respect to the parameters derived for the november 1997 episode the present ssc models yield ( cf . table  [ param ] ) a larger doppler factor ( @xmath78 vs 18 ) , a smaller magnetic field ( @xmath790.270.55 g vs 1 g ) , a flatter index of the electron distribution ( @xmath80 3.53.6 vs 4.85 ) , and a smaller frequency of the synchrotron peak ( @xmath81 vs @xmath82  hz ) with very similar emitting regions ( @xmath83 vs @xmath84  cm ) .    in summary , within a simple ssc scheme , the physical parameters of the source changed , in the sense of a harder particle spectrum , a smaller magnetic field and a greater beaming factor in the 2006 observations .",
    "this is required by the the different self ",
    "compton to synchrotron luminosity ratio , which was substantially larger in the 2006 observations .",
    "it is interesting to compare the present episode with other exceptional activity states occurred in the past in blazar sources with similar seds ( hbl , padovani & giommi 1995 ) .",
    "the most striking example todate is the strong tev activity exhibited by mkn 501 in april 1997 , observed by the whipple observatory : during the nights from 7 to 19 april 1997 , its flux ( @xmath85  gev ) changed from @xmath38 to the peak of @xmath86  crab occurred on 16 april , with an average of @xmath87  crab and no hourly timescale variability ( catanese et al .",
    "_ bepposax _ observed the simultaneous highly chromatic evolution of the source in x - rays : the flux increased by factors of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath3 in the @xmath90  kev , @xmath91  kev , and @xmath92  kev energy bands respectively , resulting in a frequency shift of the synchrotron peak by two orders of magnitude ( pian et al .",
    "1998 , tavecchio et al . 2001 ) .",
    "rxte observations revealed also timescales variability down to a few tens of minutes ( xue & cui 2005 ) . observations with u",
    "filter showed a modest increase of 1% in flux ( catanese et al .",
    "a less extreme , though analogous , behaviour was observed in mkn 421 in 1998 - 2000 . the x - ray and tev activity",
    "were correlated also on short timescale ( maraschi et al 1999 , takahashi et al . 2000 ) with larger amplitude variations in the tev band .",
    "the synchrotron peak appeared to shift to higher energies but not as dramatically as for mkn 501 .",
    "the behaviour of pks  2155 - 304 appears less striking in x - rays than for the previous two sources but more extreme in the tev variability .",
    "the important questions to be answered concern the understanding of these different `` modes '' of variability in terms of physical models of the sources .",
    "the upcoming gamma - ray missions ( agile -glast ) and the continuous developments of cherenkov telescope facilities will allow to define the spectral variability at high energies with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "it is however mandatory to complement the high energy data with extensive observations in the x - ray band in order to approach the physical origin of the variability .",
    "we presented the observations of the blazar pks  2155304 performed by the _",
    "swift _ satellite immediately after the giant tev flare observed by hess at the end of july 2006 ( raue et al .",
    "2006 ; aharonian et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the most important result appears to be that , in correspondence with the dramatic tev activity , the x - ray intensity changed by a factor 5 but without large spectral changes .",
    "in particular the frequency of the synchrotron peak remained at values similar to those observed in the past ( e.g. 1997 , chiappetti et al . 1999 ) , during low tev activity .",
    "modeling of the sed based on the ssc process in a homogeneous region suggests an increase of the doppler factor ( @xmath93 in @xmath29 ; @xmath94 in @xmath76 ) and of the relativistic electrons associated with a decrease of the magnetic field ( @xmath95 g in @xmath29 ; @xmath18 g in @xmath76 ) .",
