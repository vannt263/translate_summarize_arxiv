    "black holes almost certainly exist in the real universe . in studying their properties ,",
    "astrophysicists usually use two famous exact solutions of einstein s field equations of his general relativity theory  the schwarzschild solution that describes a static , spherically symmetric gravity of a non - rotating black hole , and the kerr solution which describes a stationary , axially symmetric gravity of a rotating black hole .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm solution which describes a static , spherically symmetric gravity of a charged , non - rotating black hole is considered to be astrophysically unrealistic , because charged macroscopic objects quickly neutralize by accreting plasma of the opposite sign .",
    "the schwarzschild and kerr black holes are now quite familiar objects in astrophysics",
    ".    however , black holes in the real universe may be different from those of the schwarzschild or of the kerr type .",
    "first , einstein s theory of gravitation has not yet been tested in its strong field limit relevant to black holes .",
    "a variety of alternative gravity theories were studied and theoretically and observationally tested , in the strong gravity limit .",
    "firstly , there is a number of papers related to braneworld black holes @xcite or stringy black holes @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is an extensive study of regular black holes where general relativity is combined with non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "inspired by some ideas of quantum theory , static and rotating , regular ( i.e. singularity - free ) , black hole spacetimes have been proposed @xcite , and also their behavior due to gravitational collapse has been studied @xcite .",
    "the solution representing regular black holes in the de sitter universe has been found in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , string theory could allow for existence of superspinars @xcite .",
    "secondly , although the quantum gravity theory is still unknown , there are numerous hints that quantum effects may influence strong gravity .",
    "several attempts have been made to describe this influence .",
    "hoava s theory @xcite is a particular recent example .",
    "like some other quantum gravity theories , it points to interesting possibilities that may be directly relevant to astrophysics : ( a ) the existence of naked singularities with observational consequences that may be calculated , ( b ) a dynamical phenomenon of `` antigravity ''  @xcite .",
    "it seems that these two features are genuine for a wide class of einsteinian ( e.g. , reissner - nordstrm ) and non - einsteinian ( e.g. , quantum ) strong gravitational fields . in this paper",
    "we discuss these phenomena specifically for the hoava gravity , in terms of embedding diagrams .",
    "the embedding diagrams help to build intuition about strongly curved spacetime geometry , which is equivalent to strong gravity .",
    "hoava @xcite proposed a new approach to quantum gravity that is a field theory based on solid state physics ideas @xcite , being invariant under lifshitz scaling ( @xmath0 ) , with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath1 flowing from @xmath2 in the short wavelength uv limit , to the value @xmath3 in the large wavelength ir limit .",
    "the theory `` could therefore serve as a uv completion of einstein s general relativity '' @xcite .",
    "gravity is an emergent property of the ir limit of the theory ; thus newton s constant is given by a constant of the theory @xmath4 , through @xmath5 , @xmath6 is being the speed of light . in this field - theoretical version of quantum gravity",
    "the field equations are derived from a lagrangian that guarantees lorentz invariance ( and no preferred time ) at low energies , but no lorentz invariance ( and a preferred time ) at high energies . because of different scaling between time and space , the hoava quantum gravity action at uv limit is not invariant under general relativistic diffeomorphisms , but it has to be invariant under a diffeomorphism preserving foliations : @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the space and time are treated differently in hoava gravity , then lorentz violation occurs at all scales at the uv regime , but vanishes in the ir general relativistic limit .",
    "soon after , kehagias and sfetsos @xcite derived and solved a modified version of hoava s field equations for the spherically symmetric , static ( i.e. a `` schwarzschild - like '' ) case",
    ". we will call it the ks spacetime ( or the ks metric ) for short . writing @xmath9 and discarding the cosmological term , the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "considered the action of modified hoava gravity @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature of the @xmath12 hypersurfaces and @xmath13 is the cotton tensor , @xmath14 is the 3-d ricci scalar of the hypersurfaces . the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 are dimensionless , while the constant @xmath17 has mass dimension 1 . the terms involving @xmath18 vanish in the spherically symmetric case @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss some extreme geometrical properties of the ks spacetimes that may be relevant for astrophysics .",
    "while hoava s theory itself is not generally covariant , our calculations in the ks metric are  they fulfill the standard rules of a covariant theory familiar from einstein general relativity .",
    "the ks spherically symmetric solution is asymptotically flat in the @xmath19 case , with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the so called lapse function of the spacetime .",
    "the obtained solution contains the parameter @xmath23 , in addition to the gravitational mass @xmath24 , and tends to the schwarzschild solution in the limit of the dimensionless parameters product @xmath25 ( expressed in geometrized units ) . presumably , @xmath26 is a universal constant , if the ks solution correctly describes the gravity of spherically symmetric objects . for large masses , @xmath27 ,",
    "the kehagias - sfetsos solution has event horizons and corresponds to a black hole @xcite .",
    "the current observational ( lower ) limits on @xmath26 are compatible with the existence of naked singularities at masses @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we conduct our discussion in terms of the _ embedding diagrams _ of the ks metric `` equatorial planes '' .",
    "the ks geometry is spherically symmetric , and therefore the geometry of all central planes is the same as that of the equatorial plane .",
    "this allows us to consider , with no loss of generality , these particular embedding diagrams as a faithful representation for the whole ks geometry .",
    "a similar approach was used previously , for different spacetimes , by several authors .",
    "for example , kristiansson et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed embedding of the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) 3-spaces .",
    "this work is particularly relevant in the present context .",
    "we will see later that rn and ks metrics share several interesting properties that nicely show up in the embeddings .",
    "we use here the standard embeddings of the conventional `` physical '' , i.e. a simply projected 3-d space but also less standard embeddings of a projected _ and in addition _ conformally re - scaled `` optical '' 3-d space .",
    "the optical geometry reflects directly some dynamical properties of the particle and photon motion .",
    "for example , geodesic lines in the ks optical 3-d space coincide with the photon trajectories .",
    "an important class of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes has a general form , @xmath29 the `` simply projected '' 3-d space at a given time @xmath30 , is defined by a @xmath30@xmath31const section of the spacetime . in this 3-d space ,",
    "one may define the `` equatorial plane '' by @xmath32@xmath31@xmath33 .",

    "<S> possible astrophysical consequences of the hoava quantum gravity theory have been recently studied by several authors . </S>",
    "<S> they usually employ the kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) spacetime which is a spherically symmetric vacuum solution of a specific version of hoava s gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the ks metric has several unusual geometrical properties that in the present article we examine by means of the often used technique of _ embedding diagrams_. we pay particular attention to the transition between naked singularity and black - hole states , which is possible along some particular sequences of the ks metrics . </S>"
