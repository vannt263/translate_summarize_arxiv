    "jets as highly collimated beams of high velocity material and outflows of comparatively lower degree of collimation and lower speed are an ubiquitous phenomenon among astrophysical objects .",
    "jets are powerful signs of activity and are observed over a wide range of luminosity and spatial scale . among the jet sources are young stellar objects ( yso ) , micro - quasars , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and most probably also gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the common models of launching , acceleration , and collimation work in the framework of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) forces ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , although the details of the process are not fully understood .    jets and outflows from yso and",
    "agn affect their environment , and , thus , the formation process of the objects they are launching them .",
    "numerous studies investigate effects of such feedback mechanisms in star formation and galaxy formation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , a quantitative investigation of how much of mass , momentum , or energy from the infall is actually recycled into a high speed outflow needs to resolve the innermost jet - launching region and to model the physical process of launching directly .",
    "this is the major aim of the present paper .    according to the current understanding , accretion and ejection",
    "are related to each other .",
    "one efficient way to remove angular momentum from a disk is to connect it to a magnetized outflow .",
    "this has been motivated by the observed correlation between signatures of accretion and ejection in jet sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the overall idea is that the energy and angular momentum are extracted from the disk by an efficient magnetic torque relying on a global , i.e. large - scale magnetic field threading the disk .",
    "if the inclination of the field lines is sufficiently small , magneto - centrifugal forces can accelerate the matter along the field line . beyond the alfvn point also lorentz forces contribute to the acceleration .",
    "the collimation of the outflow is thought to be achieved by magnetic tension due to a toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "still , we have to keep in mind the fact the the toroidal field pressure gradient acts de - collimating , and an existing external gas over - pressure may contribute to jet collimation .    before going into further details , we like to make clear that with jet _ formation _ we denote the process of accelerating and collimating an already existing slow disk wind or stellar wind in to a jet beam . with jet _ launching _ we denote the process which conveys material from radial accretion into a vertical ejection , thereby lifting it from the disk plane into the corona , and thus establishing a disk wind .    a vast literature exists on magnetohydrodynamics jet modeling .",
    "we may distinguish i ) between steady - state models and time - dependent numerical simulations , or ii ) between simulations considering the jet formation only from a fixed - in - time disk surface and simulations considering also the launching process , thus taking into account disk and jet evolution together .",
    "steady - state modeling have mostly followed the self - similar blandford & payne approach ( e.g. @xcite ) , but also fully two - dimensional models were proposed @xcite , some of them taking even into account the central stellar dipole @xcite .",
    "further , some numerical solutions have been proposed by .@xcite in a weakly ionized protostellar accretion discs that are threaded by a large - scale magnetic field as a wind - driving accretion disk .",
    "they have studied the effects of different regimes for ambipolar diffusion or hall and ohm diffusivity dominance in these disk .",
    "( self - similar ) steady - state models have also been applied to the jet launching domain @xcite , connecting the collimating outflow with the accretion disk structure .",
    "in addition to the steady - state approaches , the magneto - centrifugal jet formation mechanism has been subject of a number of time - dependent numerical studies . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of the mhd self - collimation property of jets .",
    "we note , however , that it was already 1985 when the first jet formation simulations were published , in that case for much shorter simulation time scale @xcite . among these works ,",
    "some studies investigated artificial collimation @xcite , a more consistent disk boundary condition @xcite , the effect of magnetic diffusivity on collimation @xcite , or the impact of the disk magnetization profile on collimation @xcite . in the aforementioned studies ,",
    "the jet - launching accretion disk is taken into account as a boundary condition , _ prescribing _ a certain mass flux or magnetic flux profile in the outflow .",
    "this is a reasonable setup in order to investigate jet formation , i.e. the acceleration and collimation process of a jet .",
    "however , such simulations can not tell the efficiency of mass loading or angular momentum loss from flux from disk to jet , or can not help answering the question which kind of disks do launch jets and under which circumstances .",
    "it is therefore essential to extend the jet formation setup and include the launching process in the simulations .",
    "numerical simulations of the mhd jet launching from accretion disks have been presented first by @xcite and @xcite , treating the ejection of a collimated outflow out of an evolving - in time resistive accretion disk .",
    "@xcite further developed this approach with emphasis on how resistive affect the dynamical evolution .",
    "an additional central stellar wind was considered by @xcite .",
    "further studies were concerned about the effects of the absolute field strength or the field geometry , in particular investigating field strengths around and below equipartition @xcite .",
    "these latter were _ long - term _",
    "simulations for several 100s of ( inner ) disk orbital periods , providing sufficient time evolution to also reach a ( quasi ) steady state for the fast jet flow .",
    "finally , we like to emphasize the fact that jets and outflows are observed as _ bipolar _ streams . jet and counter jet appear typically asymmetric with only very few exceptions .",
    "one exception is the protostellar jet hh212 showing an almost perfectly symmetric bipolar structure @xcite .",
    "so far , only very few numerical simulations investigating the bipolar launching of disk jets have been performed . among them",
    "are the works of @xcite or @xcite which even included a disk dynamo action .",
    "recent publications consider asymmetric ejections of stellar wind components from an offset multi - pole stellar magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the evolution of both hemispheres of a _",
    "global _ jet - disk system in order to see whether and how a global asymmetry in the large - scale outflow can be governed by the disk evolution .",
    "this has not been done so far .    in a series of two papers",
    ", we will address both the detailed physics of mhd jet launching ( paper i ) and the bipolarity aspects of jets ( paper ii ) . in the present paper ( paper i )",
    "we investigate the details of the launching , acceleration , and collimation of mhd jets from resistive magnetized accretion disks .",
    "we investigate how the mass and angular momentum fluxes depend on the internal disk physics applying long - lasting global mhd simulations of the disk - jet system .",
    "we hereby investigate different resistivity profiles of the disk .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to mhd equations and to describe the numerical setup , the initial and boundary conditions of our simulations .",
    "the general evolution of jet launching and the physical processes involved are presented in section 3 with the help of a reference simulation .",
    "section 4 is then devoted to a parameter study comparing jets from different setups .    in paper ii we will present the bipolar jets simulations , discussing their symmetry properties and how symmetry can be broken by the intrinsic disk evolution .",
    "we model the launching of a mhd outflow from a slightly sub - keplerian disk , initially in pressure equilibrium with a non - rotating disk - corona .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoonshow ] , matter is first accreted radially along a disk surrounding a central object and is then loaded on to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is threading the disk and thereby connects the accretion and ejection processes .",
    "our main goals are    * to determine the relevant mass fluxes ( mass ejection and accretion rate ) , and to study the influence on them by the leading physical parameters such as magnetic diffusivity , magnetic field strength , * to determine the resulting jet geometry - that is the asymptotic jet radius and opening angle , along with the size of the jet launching area of the disk , and the asymptotic jet velocity .",
    "we will in a follow - up paper further extend our setup into two hemispheres , to investigate iii ) the launching of bipolar jets and their symmetry characteristics .",

    "a high resolution would be required . however , as mentioned before , pluto in its current version does not allow for diffusive mhd simulations in a stretched grid .",

    "is defined corresponding to the resolution , at least 4 cells is taken as a sink height in any run . ]",
    "the internal boundary conditions defined at the right and top sides of the sink have significant impact on the simulation . if ill - defined , spurious effects arise during the early evolution already . for the right side of the sink ,",
    "we impose _ accretion conditions _ , implying a zero gradient for pressure , density , and the vertical velocity component . for @xmath70 and @xmath71 a first order extrapolation ( constant gradient )",
    "is imposed which ensures an angular momentum decrease across the boundary which is essential for accretion . to allow for accretion further , and also to minimize feedback from the sink to the domain , we constrain min@xmath72 in the ghost cells for the radial velocity component .",
    "we assume that the magnetic flux is not advected into the central object , and we impose @xmath73",
    ". the normal component of the magnetic field is calculated from the solenodality condition along both sides of the sink .    on top of the sink",
    ", we prescribe the initial local value for the gas pressure . in order to avoid evacuation of the regions close to the symmetry axis",
    ", we impose a density of 110% the initial local density .",
    "effectively , this condition replenishes the mass into the domain near to the axis to overcome numerically difficult low densities .",
    "an essential point of our setup is to impose a proper outflow boundary at the outer boundary of the domain in @xmath74-direction avoiding artificial collimation forces .",
    "here we have implemented a current - free outflow condition ( see appendix [ app : outer - boundary ] ) which avoids spurious collimation by lorentz forces and which has been thoroughly tested in our previous papers @xcite . in order to enable a long - term disk - jet simulation requiring a long - living disk accretion ,",
    "we need to provide a sufficiently long lasting mass reservoir .",
    "this could be realized by either i ) a prescribed mass inflow , by a ii ) local mass replenishment , or by iii ) providing a large mass reservoir for jet launching part of the accretion disk by extending the outer disk radius to large radii .",
    "all these approaches have been chosen in the literature .",
    "we decided to follow option iii ) and provide a sufficiently high mass reservoir outside of the inner launching region by extending the computational grid ( and thus the outer disk radius ) up to about 100 inner disk radii .",
    "similar approaches haven been applied by @xcite .",
    "we will see below ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) that our approach is working well , but has , however , its limits if applied for a very long lasting simulations . during about 5000 dynamical time steps",
    "we loose about 30 - 40% of disk the mass due to ejection and accretion and due to unwanted mass loss across the outer disk boundary .",
    "a dissipative effect is required for steady - state accretion in order to allow matter to diffuse across through the magnetic field threading the disk .",
    "magnetic diffusivity allows the mass flux to cross the field lines and thus to allow for accretion along the disk .",
    "we consider the magnetic diffusivity to be turbulent in nature , or `` anomalous '' , and , thus , can not be calculated self - consistently in our setup .",
    "the origin of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity is usually referred to be as caused by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite in a moderately magnetized disk .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that as we load turbulently diffusive disk plasma into the outflow , it is natural to assume that the outflowing material is initially turbulent initially as well .",
    "therefore , we have the option of applying a diffusive scale height @xmath75 larger than the thermal scale height @xmath76 of the disk , supposing that the turbulent disk material lifted into the outflow will remain turbulent a few more scale lengths until turbulence decays .",
    "it is clear that the strong magnetization in the upper layers of the disk will prevent generation of turbulence by e.g. the mri and will also quench the turbulence in the outflowing material . without going into detail",
    "we may estimate the time scale for the decay of the turbulence potentially existing in the outflowing material as follows .",
    "the decay of ( helical ) mhd turbulence follows a power law @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the magnetic energy and the power law index depends on further details but is in the range of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "simulations indicate that mhd turbulence decays as fast as the hydrodynamic turbulence on a few eddy turnover times @xcite . with @xmath80 ( in code units )",
    ", we find a time scale for the decay of mhd turbulence launched from the disk into the outflow of e.g. @xmath81 , thus in the range of half an orbital period .",
    "this must be compared to the kinematic time scale for the jet launching .",
    "if we consider the propagation of the initially slow disk wind over a few disk pressure scale heights @xmath82 , we find that this time is of the order of a few eddy turnover times . also , we will later see that jet launching is a rapid process with an outflow being established already after a few dynamical time steps .",
    "given the essential role of the magnetic diffusivity for wind / jet launching , we decided to investigate the launching process for different strength and different scale height of diffusivity .",
    "we have run simulations for a variety of combinations of parameter values , but for sake of comparison , in this paper , we show results for diffusive scale height values , @xmath83 .",
    "formally , we apply an @xmath0 prescription @xcite , similar also to previous works ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we assume the diffusivity tensor to be diagonal with the non - zero components @xmath84 here , we have defined a poloidal magnetic diffusivity @xmath85 , and the toroidal magnetic diffusivity @xmath86 , respectively effectively governs the diffusion of the poloidal magnetic field , while the @xmath87 and @xmath88 govern the diffusion of the toroidal magnetic field ] , with a function @xmath89 describing the diffusivity profile . as it is known from the literature ,",
    "an _ an - isotropic _ magnetic diffusivity is required to obtain stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "most of the numerical simulations followed that approach and did find a stationary - state from their simulations as well ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that simulations of @xcite apply an isotropic diffusivity and reach a steady state as well .",
    "we define an anisotropy parameter by the ratio of the toroidal to poloidal diffusivity components , @xmath90 . for the diffusivity function",
    "@xmath91 several options can be considered . for the simulations in this paper ( paper i )",
    "we apply @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 govern the strength of magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the alfvn speed @xmath95 , and the disk thermal scale height @xmath96 are both calculated along the mid - plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath97 measures the scale height of the disk magnetic diffusivity , similar to the hydrodynamic disk scale height parameter @xmath98 .",
    "for the present paper , we decided not to evolve the diffusivity profile in time .",
    "we find that since both the disk scale height @xmath99 and the alfvn speed @xmath100 do vary as the disk evolves , the strength of diffusivity may vary substantially from the initially prescribed value ( up to a factor 10 ) .",
    "this highly non - linear feedback may disturb the progress of our simulation such that an artificially high diffusivity may be derived which will affect the numerical time stepping .",
    "a constant - in - time prescription of diffusivity simplifies our aim of disentangling the governing physical processes involved in jet launching .    in the follow - up paper ii presenting truly bipolar jet launching",
    "we will discuss further models for the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we again stress the importance to provide the reader with the actual number values of the magnetic diffusivity applied in time , only the initial diffusivity distribution was provided , butvnot its temporal evolution , and , thus , the magnetic diffusivity distribution which is actually involved in producing the outflow ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "our reference simulation , case 1 is carried out up to @xmath110 dynamical time , corresponding to 796 inner disk orbital periods and is thus one of the longest simulations considering the mhd jet launching .",
    "this huge time period corresponds , however , only to 3 rotations at a radius @xmath111 and correspondingly less at the outer grid radius @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , while the inner part of the disk , and thus the outflow evolving from that part , has reached a steady state situation , the outer disk corona is still dynamically evolving .",

    "[ fig : accelement ] , top ) .",
    "we may identify two essential effects affecting the long - term disk evolution .",
    "firstly , the mass reservoir in the outer disk has decreased - mainly due to outwards mass loss across the outer disk boundary .",
    "secondly , the mass of the inner jet - launching disk has also decreased - due to both outflow activity and accretion into the sink .    comparing the mass content of the disk at the initial and final stage , we find that the total disk mass decreases from @xmath120 at @xmath30 to @xmath121 at @xmath122 ( in code units ) . integrating the mass loss by accretion and ejection into the jet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : accelement ] ) over 5000 dynamical time steps , we find a total mass loss of @xmath123 .",
    "the difference , i.e. @xmath124 , is the mass which is lost from the outermost disk in vertical and radial direction .    in other words , a substantial amount of the disk mass loss is lost from the very outer part of the disk and does not directly influences the jet formation .",
    "the disk mass which is lost from the inner part is partly lost as disk wind / jet , partly accreted into the sink and partly replenished by accretion from outer radii .",
    "the time evolution of the disk mass gives a similar picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : accelement ] , bottom ) .",
    "integrated over the whole domain , the disk loses about @xmath125 of its mass until @xmath110 in the reference simulation case 1 .",
    "if we decrease the integration domain ( outer radius @xmath126 ) the inner disk looses less mass while part of its mass is being accreted from outer disk radii . in general",
    "this implies that up to time @xmath122 , there is i ) still sufficient mass to support the accretion process , but also that ii ) the disk mass shows a considerable decrease which may have changed the internal disk properties .",
    "thus , for an even longer - lasting simulation one would have to invent another mass source for the disk accretion ( e.g. by a physical mass inflow boundary condition at the outer disk radius properly taking into account angular momentum transfer , or a floor density distribution in the disk ) .",

    "this also changes the launching conditions , as the overall profiles of plasma-@xmath104 , resp .",

    "figure  [ fig : adve_diff ] displays the time evolution of the magnetic flux surface @xmath131 for reference simulation case 1 , initially rooted at the radius @xmath132 .",
    "we see that this flux surface is first moving ( diffusing ) outwards \" driven \" by magnetic pressure gradient and tension , and then , once disk accretion has established again moves inwards being advected with the mass flux .",
    "after about @xmath133 both processes balance and a quasi steady - state situation in the system evolution is reached .",
    "considering simply flux conservation , we may estimate the change in poloidal magnetic field strength and the corresponding change in magnetic diffusivity and plasma-@xmath104 .",
    "estimating an average field strength @xmath134 and a corresponding magnetic flux @xmath135 , flux conservation tells us that @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , @xmath137 , since this flux surface ( e.g. @xmath131 ) is now rooted at a different radius . with the increased poloidal magnetic field strength the alfvn speed @xmath138 increases , and , thus , also the magnetic diffusivity parameterized as @xmath139 .",
    "thus , we expect that in previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) the actual ( time - dependent ) value of the magnetic diffusivity may differ substantially from its initial value .",
    "we believe that this will impact the derived mass fluxes .",
    "a similar estimate can be made for the plasma-@xmath104 or magnetization . since @xmath140 ,",
    "the increase in plasma-@xmath104 is by a factor 100 , which also is expected to affect the jet formation severely .",
    "we will come back to this point later when we compare different parameter runs .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate what fraction of the mass accretion is loaded into the outflow , and how the mass loading is affected by various disk parameters .",
    "the derived mass ejection - to - accretion ratio can be an important ingredient for studies of agn or yso feedback , or another similar self - regulating outflow scenario .",
    "efficient accretion is feasible only if angular momentum is sufficiently removed . since we do not consider a physical viscosity in our simulations , angular momentum removal from the disk",
    "is mostly accomplished by the torque of the magnetized disk wind .",

    "we discuss the inflow and outflow rates in our disk - jet simulations , concentrating first on reference run ( case 1 ) .    in order to calculate the integrated properties of inflow and outflow , such as mass flux or angular momentum flux , we need to carefully select the integration domain .",

    "the accretion rate is then calculated as @xmath147 where the parameter @xmath148 controls the scale height of the integration , and @xmath149 is the initial thermal scale height of the disk .",
    "considering the evolution of the large - scale disk velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : accretion_layer ] ) , we have chosen @xmath150 for our reference simulation . similarly , we calculate the ejected mass flux as @xmath151 where the integration is done along the inclined surface area s from @xmath152 to @xmath141 considering the area element @xmath153 .    the time evolution of the accretion and ejection rate for the reference simulation is shown in fig .  [ fig : accr_plot ] .",
    "we have calculated the accretion and ejection rates for different sizes of the integration domain ( thus with different outer radius @xmath141 ) .",
    "we observe that for small radii the accretion rate saturates at an approximately constant value .",
    "for the outer parts of the disk , however , a longer dynamical time is required for the disk to evolve into a new dynamical steady state .",
    "this is visible in the time evolution of the accretion rates - for increasing radii @xmath154 , the time when the plateau phase is reached , is increasing to @xmath155 . beyond the plateau phase",
    ", the mass fluxes slightly decrease , most probably due to the overall decrease of the disk mass itself , and the subsequent change in the internal disk dynamics .",
    "the accretion rates at large radii are larger than those at smaller radii - the mass difference is ejected as outflow . for the control volume with larger @xmath141 the ejection rate increases , which is simply a consequence of the increased integration area .",
    "the last panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : accr_plot ] shows the ejection - to - accretion rate @xmath156 .",
    "again , depending on the size of the control volume this fraction changes .",
    "although the outflow quickly evolves from the disk surface , and extends soon to large radii , several orbital periods are required to establish full accretion . at earlier times and for large radii ,",
    "the accretion process is not fully established , resulting in a somewhat arbitrarily high ejection - to - accretion ratios even above unity .",
    "for the inner part of the disk within radii @xmath157 , about 60% of the accreting material is diverted into the outflow for our reference simulation .",

    "the pressure gradient , centrifugal force and lorentz force also contribute to accelerate the outflow . in agreement with the literature",
    "we see that upstream the slow magneto - sonic point , the acceleration is mainly by the gas pressure gradient . for the super - slow outflow the lorentz force and the centrifugal force dominate . for the super - fast flow the lorentz force plays a major role . in case of the collimating forces",

    "the toroidal component of the lorentz force @xmath177 provides the magnetic torque braking the disk , and loading the outflow with both angular momentum and energy ( not shown ) . in order to brake the disk ,",

    "the ( positive ) gas pressure is almost balanced by the ( negative ) lorentz force .",
    "however , the gas pressure slightly wins and counteracts gravity .",
    "essentially the figure shows that launching is a process which happens at the disk surface .",
    "the outflow material is not lifted from the mid plane into the disk wind .",
    "it is the disk material which is accreting along the disk surface which is loaded into the outflow .",

    "thus , since mass loading requires poloidal magnetic diffusivity , the jet launching area can be extended into higher altitudes above the disk surface .",
    "furthermore , the jet launching area is extended into a domain where the plasma-@xmath104 is comparatively low .",
    "taking into account both effects , one may therefore expect i ) to launch jets from disks which would themselves be insufficiently magnetized for jet - driving , and also ii ) to launch outflow which have a rather low mass flux and subsequently higher terminal velocity . in order to investigate this effects ,",

    "the amplitudes decrease when the diffusive scale height decreases .",
    "for @xmath179 they are damped completely .",
    "we believe that these perturbations are generated by a physical process within the launching region and that they are simply smoothed out by the magnetic diffusivity . a further study is needed to clarify this issue .    for increasing scale height the accretion rate and ejection rate decrease , confirming the correlation derived above between the increasing magnitude of diffusivity and decreasing mass fluxes . in other words ,",
    "an increasing diffusivity scale height simply corresponds to a higher diffusivity with the consequences as discussed above .",
    "interestingly , all our simulations for different diffusivity scale heights converge to the same kinetic angular momentum flux in the outflow . on the other hand",
    ", we find a trend of decreasing magnetic angular momentum flux with decreasing diffusivity scale height .",
    "in this section we highlight some of our results discussing them in the context of numerical studies published previously .",
    "our main goal was to perform a consistent parameter study to investigate a variety of physical effects involved in jet launching by using _",
    "one _ code with _",
    "one _ numerical setup .",
    "only this allows us to disentangle the leading effects involved in jet launching without the uncertainty introduced by interpreting results obtained with different codes ( vac , pluto , flash ) or setups .",
    "we first stress the point that we apply a well defined , fixed - in - time _ magnetic diffusivity _ distribution .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is an leading parameter which influences the whole disk - jet evolution @xcite .",
    "previous simulations @xcite have applied a diffusivity evolving in time . this might be considered as more advanced , however , the previous authors do not provide details about time - evolution of the diffusivity , thus intruducing some level of uncertainty . here , we have demonstrated how diffusion and advection of magnetic flux does change the disk alfvn speed ( and thus the magnetic diffusivity if a time - dependent @xmath180 is applied ) by a factor of ten . on the other hand , by applying different strength and scale height for the diffusivity we investigate the interrelation between magnetic diffusivity and the accretion and ejection mass fluxes .",
    "similarly , we provide information about the spatio - temporal _ evolution of the magnetization _ ( or plasma-@xmath104 in our case ) . @xcite have published a magnetization study , however , on a smaller grid and for substantially shorter dynamical evolution . in our paper",
    "we show in particular how the magnetization profile flares over 1000s of dynamical time scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : log_beta_case1 ] ) . thus , along with the evolving outflow , the magnetization above the disk surface is substantially lower compared to the initial condition .",
    "we obtain _ jet velocities _ which seem to be smaller compared to previously published values .",
    "for example , @xcite detect asymptotic velocities of 1.5 - 1.8 times the footpoint keplerian speed for the field lines crossing the upper boundary .",
    "simulations of jet formation from a fixed - in - time disk surface boundary ( see e.g.  @xcite ) give similar values .",
    "in contrast , we report lower velocities of about 0.8 times the keplerian speed at the inner disk radius .",
    "note however , that our values result from a differently defined measure of the jet velocity .",
    "we suggest that this mass - flux weigthed asymptotic speed - the average velocity of the bulk mass flux - is more applicable to observations .",

    "we quantify the _ jet collimation _ degree by the directed mass fluxes . for the jet opening angle",
    "we find somewhat larger values than in previous studies .",
    "we suppose that this results from the modified outflow condition we have applied as we have seen that the original outflow condition lead to smaller opening angles .",
    "we have run _ long - lasting simulations _ of up to 5000 dynamical time - scales @xmath181 .",
    "this allows us to i ) reach a quasi steady - state situation of the simulation , but also to investigate the evolution beyond .",
    "we find a slight but persistent change in the inflow - outflow dynamics on this very long time scales , such that the accretion rate slightly decreases .",
    "the main reason for this we see in the decrease of the disk mass for such long time scales .",
    "however , the effect has an direct astrophysical application as it may be applied to the long - term evolution of classical tts when the disk accretion in fact weakens after some @xmath182 years .",
    "we note that previous simulations were substantially shorter , lasting until 400 dynamical time steps @xmath181 @xcite or 30 inner disk rotations @xcite .",
    "an exception is the simulation by @xcite lasting for more than 900 inner disk orbits . that paper focusses , however , on the launching physics and does not show the large - scale evolution of the outflow .",
    "together with the long time evolution , we have also have applied a _ large grid size_. compared to @xcite who investigate how magnetization affects launching by using a @xmath183 grid , our grid has about double size .",
    "@xcite concentrate on the launching process of weakly magnetized disk and display only results on @xmath184 images ( which are a subsets of a @xmath185 ) .",
    "for yso , our grid extension corresponds to about 28au along the jet , well into the observable region .",
    "we note that we have applied an equidistant grid for the magnetically diffusive disk area which is consistent with the pluto code requirements .",
    "this is different to @xcite who attach a scaled grid for the diffusive outer disk .",
    "we have presented results of mhd simulations investigating the launching of jets and outflows from a magnetically diffusive disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "the time evolution of the accretion disk structure is self - consistently taken into account .",
    "the simulations are performed in axisymmetry applying the mhd code pluto .",
    "the main goal of our simulations was to study how magnetic diffusivity ( its magnitude and distribution ) and magnetization affect the disk and outflow properties , such as mass and angular momentum fluxes , jet collimation , or jet radius .",
    "our grids extend to @xmath59 inner disk radii with a resolution of @xmath186 , respectively @xmath187 inner disk radii with a higher resolution of @xmath188 .",
    "an internal boundary ( sink ) is placed close to the origin absorbing the accreted mass and angular momentum .",
    "we have prescribed a magnetic diffusivity in the disk based on an @xmath0-prescription .",
    "one of our parameters was the scale height of the magnetic diffusivity with the option to have it higher than the thermal scale height .",
    "this can be motivated considering that it is the turbulent disk material which is loaded into the outflow , and that the turbulence pattern is swept along with the disk wind until it decays .",
    "we have investigated disks carrying a magnetic flux corresponding to an initial plasma - beta ranging from 10 to 5000 at the inner disk radius .    as a general result",
    "we observe a continuous and robust outflow launched from the inner part of the disk , expanding into a collimated jet and is accelerated to super fast magneto - sonic speed .",
    "the key results of our simulations can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) concerning the _ acceleration of the outflows _ , our simulations confirm that the magneto - centrifugal acceleration mechanism is most efficient in the low plasma-@xmath104 regime , while for weak magnetic fields the toroidal magnetic pressure gradient drives the ejected material .",
    "we also confirm that the magnetocentrifugal mechanism also depends on the mass load in the outflow , as this mechanism works more efficiently for outflows with low mass fluxes .",
    "however , compared to the magnetic pressure driven outflows , jets in the magnetocentrifugal acceleration regime have usually higher mass fluxes .    in our simulations with very high plasma-@xmath104",
    "we detect a highly unsteady behaviour    \\(2 ) efficient magneto - centrifugal driving which can accelerate jets to high kinetic energy relies on a strong coupling between magnetic field and the rotating disk , thus on a low diffusivity .",
    "we find that it is the poloidal diffusivity @xmath189 which mainly affects the driving of the outflow .",
    "however , besides the coupling needed for acceleration , also the _ launching of material _ depends on diffusivity . with increasing @xmath189 , the mass fluxes ( both the accretion rate and the ejection rate ) decrease",
    "subsequently , the higher ejection rates result in a lower asymptotic outflow velocities .",
    "\\(3 ) we measure typical _ outflow velocities _ are in the range of @xmath190 times the inner disk rotational velocity with the tendency that the mass fluxes obtained in magneto - centrifugally driven outflow are substantially higher . here",
    ", we confirm the clear ( inverse ) correlation between jet velocity and mass load , as it is well known from the literature .",
    "note that we have apply a mass - flux - weighted jet velocity which we find more applicable to the observations . for the bulk mass flux",
    "we find lower velocities compared to other papers , which are mostly dealing with the maximum speed obtained in the simulation .",
    "our maximum velocities are similar . the relatively high speed of the outflows with low poynting flux which are driven by poloidal pressure gradient is unclear .",
    "we find that the toroidal diffusivity affects the _ outflow rotation _ - a small toroidal diffusivity implies a larger jet rotational velocity .",
    "this has not shown before in simulations .",
    "\\(4 ) we do not find a clear correlation between the _ outflow collimation _ and the magnetic field strength .",
    "also weakly magnetized outflows , which are driven by the magnetic pressure gradient , and which we find to be quite unsteady , show a high degree of collimation .",
    "the question of collimation for the weakly magnetized outflows is not answered .",
    "we find that outflows within the magneto - centrifugal - driving regime the flows ejected from a weakly diffusive disks are only weakly collimated .",
    "similarly , their jet radius ( here defined as mass flux weighted radius ) is larger in case of a lower poloidal magnetic diffusivity . follwoing the magnetic flux surface along the bulk mass flux from the asymtotic regime to the launching area",
    ", we can defined the _ launching area _ of the outflow .",
    "we find a size of the launching area from which the bulk of the mass flux originates in the range between 3 and 8 inner disk radii or about 0.4 au .",
    "\\(5 ) depending on the strength of magnetic diffusivity , the disk - jet structure may evolve into a steady - state .",
    "we found that the cases with the strong field with @xmath191 and poloidal diffusivity @xmath192 will reach a quasi steady state , confirming the literature .",
    "\\(6 ) the magnetic flux profile along the disk is subject to advection and diffusion .",
    "we find that the magnetization ( or plasma-@xmath104 ) of disk and outflow may therefore substantially change during the time evolution .",
    "we have observed that the initial disk magnetization may change by a factor of 100 .",
    "this may have severe impact on the launching process and the formation of the outflow in the sense that a rather highly magnetized disk may evolve into a weakly magnetized disk which can not drive strong outflows .",
    "this issue has not been discussed before in the literature .",
    "\\(7 ) for very long time scales the accretion disk changes its internal dynamics , as due to outflow ejection and disk accretion the disk mass decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the accretion and ejection rates slightly decrease . in order to compensate for this effect",
    ", we have applied a large outer disk radius providing a large mass reservoir for the inner jet - launching disk .",
    "\\(8 ) for our simulations , we found that 10 - 50% of the accreting plasma can be diverted into the outflow . for i )",
    "less diffusive disks , ii ) a strong magnetic field , iii ) a low poloidal diffusivity , or a iv ) lower numerical diffusivity ( resolution ) , the mass loading into the outflow is increased - resulting in more massive jets .",
    "we interpret as physical reason the more efficient extraction of angular momentum from the disk , due to the stronger matter - field coupling .",
    "note that we do not consider in our simulations viscosity or the wealth of thermal effects which play an essential role for launching @xcite .",
    "\\(9 ) we found that jets launched in a setup with smaller diffusive scale height are more perturbed .",
    "the same effect is seen in outflows launched from disks with weaker diffusivity .",
    "\\(10 ) we finally remark that it is essential to do long - term simulations covering thousands of rotational periods in order to find a steady state situation of the accretion - ejection dynamics .",
    "our simulations run for 5000 dynamical time steps , corresponding to about 900 revolutions at the inner disk radius as adopted in our reference run .    in summary",
    ", we confirm the hypothesis that efficient magneto - centrifugal jet driving requires a strong magnetic flux ( i.e. a low plasma beta ) , together with a large enough magnetic torque in order to produce a powerful jet .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of ( turbulent ) magnetic diffusivity plays the major role in the ejection efficiency , while the anisotropy in the diffusivity mainly affects the jet rotation .",
    "both results imply that the structure of the asymptotic jet is indeed governed by the properties of the accretion disk , here parametrized by the magnetization and magnetic diffusivity",
