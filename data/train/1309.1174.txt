    "for the sake of simplicity , let us represent the amplitudes ( or purifications ) as two - dimensional arrows and the phase between two of them as the angle between their corresponding arrows . in fig . 1",
    ", we sketch different behaviors of the amplitudes ( arrows ) when they are transported according to the uhlmann s parallel condition along a closed trajectory embracing the whole brilluoin zone , i.e. from @xmath162 to @xmath163 , this is left to right on the fig .",
    "we observe several situations :    * @xmath164 in the trivial topological regime [ fig .",
    "the arrow is transported with constant slope , the initial and final arrows are parallel , so that @xmath165 . *",
    "@xmath164 in the non - trivial topological regime [ fig .",
    "the uhlmann phase remains 0 until some singular point @xmath120 , where the direction of the amplitude is suddenly flipped , and so it remains up to the final point @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the initial arrow and the final arrow form an angle of @xmath20 , then @xmath166 .",
    "* @xmath167 in a non - trivial topological regime [ fig .",
    "the behavior of the uhlmann phase follows a similar pattern as before , but now the temperature displaces the position of @xmath120 towards the end of the brillouin zone . * @xmath168 in a non - trivial topological regime [ fig .",

    "see comments on the main text of this document . ]",
    "note that the uhlmann phase places on equal footing @xmath116 and the parameters of the hamiltonian @xmath171 .",
    "thus , the position of the critical momentum @xmath120 is affected by both @xmath171 and @xmath116 . in summary ,",
    "as commented in the letter , the existence of a critical temperature @xmath0 is connected to a topological kink structure @xcite in the uhlmann holonomy .",
    "more precisely , the variation of temperature produces the presence of absence of a topological kink associated to the physical critical momentum @xmath120 .",
    "in fact , there is not a connection between the uhlmann phase and the presence or absence of edge states . the critical momentum @xmath120 splits the holonomy into two dis - equivalent topological components according to the value taken by @xmath61 when performing the trajectory .",
    "the first component is the region with @xmath172 and @xmath123 , and the second is the region with @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "note that these two different components can not be smoothly connected as for that aim the momentum has to cross the singular point @xmath175 . in the trivial topological regime @xmath123 for every point along the trajectory and",
    "there is only one component .",
    "the effect of the temperature in the uhlmann parallel transport can be understood as a displacement of the topological kink along @xmath61-space .",
    "the critical temperature corresponds to the situation where @xmath120 is at the edge of the brillouin zone . in other words",
    ", @xmath0 determines the admissible amount of noise / disorder such that the uhlmann holonomy along the brilluoin zone presents a topological kink structure . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the noise is high enough that the kink is effectively `` erased '' and the uhlmann geometric phase becomes trivial .",
    "as stressed in the letter , the uhlmann phase is a physical observable .",
    "thus , for the sake of completion we provide here some hints about its measurement in a real experiment . the purpose of this section is to explain how the already existing experimental proposals to measure the uhlmann phase in the optical domain @xcite could be adapted to 1d fermionic systems .    since the uhlmann holonomy is defined as a relative phase between amplitudes , in order to measure it we need some auxiliary degree of freedom to construct them from density matrices .",
    "we hereby present two different ways for this to be implemented .",
    "this method is based on the fact that amplitudes @xmath176 can be seen as pure states @xmath177 living in an enlarged hilbert space @xmath178 where both system and ancilla hilbert spaces are of the same dimension @xcite .",
    "for instance , we may introduce two electrons in the system with the same crystalline momentum @xmath179 and in the lowest energy band , differing only in a particular non - dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "taking the creuzt ladder model as an example , the two electrons could differ on their spins @xmath180 and be prepared in their ground states .",
    "once this has been done , we may apply the following steps :    1 .",
    "prepare an entangled state in the diagonal basis of the two electrons of the following form : @xmath181 where @xmath182 .",
    "let us take for simplicity the flat - band case where @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , once the temperature is fixed , @xmath183 is a constant during the holonomy . by taking partial trace with respect to the ancillary electron ,",
    "the reduced state for the system electron is @xmath184 this corresponds to a thermal state of the system written in the diagonal basis of the system hamiltonian .",
    "2 .   implement the holonomy in @xmath76space .",
    "for example by applying the unitary operation @xmath185 on the ancillary electron . this",
    "is determined by imposing the uhlmann s parallel transport condition on the trajectory @xmath186 such that @xmath187 and @xmath188 , where @xmath189 stands for the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "this might be achieved using a spin dependent force .",
    "3 .   interferometry to measure the relative phase . to retrieve the uhlmann phase ,",
    "we make use of @xmath190 this can be implemented using atom interferometry techniques similar to those in @xcite .",
    "another example where the degree of control over fermionic systems is at the highest level can be found in @xcite .",
    "a different approach to construct amplitudes was proposed for the optical domain in @xcite .",
    "the idea is again to enlarge the hilbert space @xmath191 .",
    "however , instead of preparing two copies of the system , it is just required an auxiliary two - dimensional quantum system ( qubit ) .",
    "then system and qubit are prepared in a certain mixed state @xmath192 .",
    "it can be shown that the amplitudes associated to the state @xmath193 appear in the coherences of this larger state @xmath194 @xcite : @xmath195 where @xmath12 is the dimension of the system , i.e. the number of bands for the fermion models .",
    "secondly , a protocol can be designed @xcite in order to implement the unitary @xmath185 on the amplitude and retrieve the uhlmann phase after the holonomy using again atom interferometric techniques .",
    "therefore , we can envision possible measurement schemes for the uhlmann phase in fermionic systems based on what has already been proposed previously for photons in the context of geometric phases for qubits .",
    "however , giving a precise experimental proposal for a particular setup would require further analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper ."
