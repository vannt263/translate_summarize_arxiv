    "the underlying mechanisms which govern the large range in low - frequency radio luminosity observed in radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are currently unknown . over the previous two decades",

    "2003 ; zirm , dickinson & dey 2003 ) .",
    "one of the incontrovertible observational facts which has emerged from these studies , at least at @xmath15 , is that the host galaxies of all powerful radio - loud agn are massive @xmath16 ellipticals ( eg .",

    "1996 ; mclure et al . 1999",
    "; dunlop et al .",
    "the apparent uniformity of radio - loud agn host galaxies has taken on added importance over the last few years , following the discovery in nearby ( distance @xmath17 150 mpc ) inactive galaxies that a reasonably accurate estimate ( @xmath18 dex ) of the central black - hole mass can be obtained via its correlation with the mass of the host spheroidal component ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; tremaine et al",
    "moreover , recent progress has also indicated that a similarly accurate black - hole mass estimate ( @xmath19 dex ) can be obtained for broad - line agn using emission - line widths to derive the virial mass estimate ( eg .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "consequently , a large body of work has appeared in the recent literature investigating the possible link between radio luminosity and black - hole mass in radio - loud agn ( eg .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , observational studies have traditionally been subject to a degeneracy between radio luminosity and redshift produced as a by - product of flux - limited radio samples . in order to study the properties of radio - loud agn separated by a large dynamic range in radio luminosity",
    ", it has previously been necessary to select samples consisting of objects covering a wide range of redshifts .",
    "this has led to difficulties in interpreting the data due to the complication of potentially significant evolutionary effects .",
    "however , by selecting our sample of objects from four complete , low - frequency selected radio samples with successively fainter flux - density limits , it has been possible to construct a sample of radio galaxies which spans three decades in radio luminosity at a virtually constant cosmic epoch ( @xmath20 ) . in this respect",
    "the motivation for this study is identical to that pursued by hill & lilly ( 1991 ) , who investigated the cluster environments of a sample of 45 radio galaxies spanning a similar range in radio luminosities at @xmath21 . by successfully disentangling the effects of luminosity and redshift for the first time , hill & lilly ( 1991 )",
    "were able to demonstrate that @xmath21 marks an apparent epoch - dependent change in cluster environment , with radio galaxies tending to inhabit significantly richer cluster environments than their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "furthermore , the wide range of radio luminosities in the hill & lilly sample enabled them to determine that extended radio luminosity did not appear to be a strong function of cluster richness .",
    "developments over the intervening decade have provided our new study with two crucial advantages over the previous work of hill & lilly ( 1991 ) .",
    "firstly , the availability of the 7crs ( willott et al . 2003 ; lacy et al .",
    "1999 ) and texox-1000 ( hill & rawlings 2003 ) radio samples has now allowed us to compile a sample of 41 radio galaxies at @xmath21 , which is complete over the full three - decades range in radio power .",
    "secondly , with the high - resolution imaging provided by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and the improvement in follow - up observations available with ground - based telescopes , we are now in a position to obtain a wide range of high quality data - sets for our new sample which were not obtainable only ten years ago . consequently , our new sample of @xmath21 radio galaxies is the basis for an ambitious project , which will for the first time systematically investigate the connection between the radio luminosity of radio galaxies , the properties of their host galaxies , their location on the fundamental plane , the richness and mass of their cluster environments and the masses of their central black holes .",
    "the results presented in this paper represent the first stage of this wide - ranging project , and concentrate solely on the analysis of our deep @xmath0band hst wfpc2 imaging data .",
    "the results of our extensive follow - up observations of the sample are deferred to a series of future papers .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows , in section 2 the details of the radio - galaxy sample are described , while in section 3 the hst observations and data reduction are discussed . in section 4",
    "the modelling of the hst imaging is described , with the main results presented and compared to literature results on low - redshift radio galaxies in section 5 . in section 6 the host - galaxy properties of our 3crr sub - sample are compared to literature results to explore the evidence for dynamical evolution of the most powerful radio galaxies within the redshift range @xmath9 . in section 7 the properties of the radio - galaxy hosts",
    "are compared to those of local brightest cluster galaxies . in section 8",
    "the masses of the radio galaxies central black holes are estimated , and in section 9 the relationship between black - hole mass and radio luminosity is investigated .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized in section 10 . unless otherwise stated , throughout this paper the following cosmology is assumed : @xmath22 kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab4 ]      the mean value of the srsic @xmath3 parameter for the full zp5 sample is @xmath26 , consistent with that expected for classical elliptical galaxies ( the typical uncertainty in @xmath3 is @xmath27 ) .",
    "the average @xmath3 values displayed in table [ tab4 ] for the four radio - galaxy sub - samples show no evidence for any trend between the @xmath3 parameter and radio luminosity .    in fig [ fig3 ]",
    "we show a histogram of the derived @xmath3 parameters for the full zp5 sample .",
    "although fig [ fig3 ] confirms that the morphologies of the zp5 sample radio galaxies are consistent with the classical @xmath28 value , we note here that there are a substantial number of objects with @xmath29 .",
    "the possible implications of this in light of the recent discovery of a correlation between @xmath3 and central black - hole mass ( graham et al .",
    "2001 ; erwin et al .",
    "2003 ) will be discussed in section [ graham ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 parameters derived for the zp5 sample is in good agreement with that determined by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for their sample of twenty 3c - class radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars at @xmath30 .",
    "the mean @xmath3 parameter determined by dunlop et al . for their radio - loud agn sample was @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately there are no comparable samples in the literature of radio galaxies at higher redshift , for which srsic @xmath3 parameters have been derived , with which to compare the morphological results derived for the present sample .      in the final column of table",
    "3 brief comments are listed describing the structure revealed by subtracting the best - fitting axially - symmetric host - galaxy model from the radio - galaxy images ( see fig 2 for examples ) .",
    "objects for which the best - fitting galaxy model produces a clean subtraction , with little or no residual structure present in the subtracted images , are described as being undisturbed ( ud ) .",
    "these objects comprise one third of the full zp5 sample .",
    "objects which show clear signs of interaction are described as being mergers ( m ) , with those cases where the secondary nucleus / companion object has a luminosity @xmath32  10% of that of the radio - galaxy being described as major mergers ( mm ) .",
    "objects for which the modelling indicates the presence of an unresolved point - source nucleus with luminosity @xmath32  10% of that of the radio galaxy ( eg . toot  1303 + 3334 , 7c  1731 + 6638 ) are described as possible quasar cores ( qc ? ) . finally ,",
    "those objects whose model - subtracted images reveal symmetric , central positive flux residuals are described as having possible disc or aligned emission ( da ? ) .",
    "the information provided by the model - subtracted images is not pursued further within this paper , which concentrates on the properties of the dominant smooth stellar component of the radio - galaxy hosts .",
    "however , this information will be fully exploited by a forthcoming paper which explores the link between radio luminosity / structure and the kpc - scale environments of the radio galaxies , the incidence and magnitude of interaction / merger activity , aligned emission components and the properties of those radio galaxies with possible quasar cores ( mitchell et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the radio galaxies have been calculated under the assumption that the spectral energy distributions of the hosts can be well represented by the passively evolving stellar populations typical of massive early - type galaxies .",
    "this decision is based on several lines of evidence , including the morphological results presented in the previous section , the @xmath33 colour versus redshift distribution of 7crs objects ( willott , rawlings & blundell 2001 ) and the off - nuclear spectroscopy of @xmath34 quasar host galaxies ( nolan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , the initial results from our follow - up spectroscopic observations , designed to determine the host - galaxy stellar - velocity dispersions , indicate that the host - galaxy spectra are consistent with mature stellar populations ( willott et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes for each host galaxy presented in table [ tab3 ] are based on the integrated instrumental ( f785lp ) magnitudes returned by the modelling code .",
    "these instrumental magnitudes are then converted to apparent @xmath0cousins magnitudes using the filter transformations and colour equations detailed in holtzman et al .",
    "the apparent colours required for this transformation were calculated from the 1995 version of bruzual & charlot single - burst elliptical galaxy stellar - population models ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , under the assumption of a @xmath35 formation redshift . following correction for cosmological dimming within our chosen cosmology , evolution and @xmath36corrections were then applied using the same bruzual & charlot models .",
    "galactic extinction corrections were then applied to each object ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , before a final conversion to absolute @xmath37cousins magnitudes was made , assuming a @xmath38 colour of @xmath39 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , in order to facilitate a straightforward comparison with literature results on radio - galaxy properties .",
    "the surface - brightness results presented in tables 3 & 4 have been corrected for @xmath40 cosmological dimming , and then k - corrected and corrected for passive evolution in the same fashion as the absolute magnitudes .",
    "the host - galaxy luminosities presented in tables [ tab3 ] & [ tab4 ] and fig 4 demonstrate that the host galaxies of all four sub - samples are luminous , with a mean integrated @xmath37band absolute magnitude for the full zp5 sample of @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , these luminosities are directly comparable to the luminosities of galaxies drawn from the bright end of the local cluster - galaxy luminosity function . a comparison with the recent study of yagi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows that the mean host - galaxy luminosity of the full zp5 sample is @xmath42 , where the yagi et al .",
    "determination of @xmath43 for local cluster galaxies is @xmath44 in our adopted cosmology .",
    "the mean host - galaxy luminosities presented in table [ tab4 ] also allow a comparison to be made with the host - galaxy luminosity differences between the 3c , 6c and 7c samples determined from the @xmath45 diagram ( willott et al .",
    "2003 ; eales et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the @xmath36band , willott et al . find a mean luminosity difference of 0.33 magnitudes between the 3c and 6c samples , and a corresponding difference of 0.55 magnitudes between the 3c and 7c samples .",
    "the equivalent figures from the analysis of our hst imaging are 0.34@xmath46 magnitudes and @xmath47 magnitudes in the @xmath37band , in good agreement with the @xmath36band results .",
    "the rough scaling between extended radio luminosity and host - galaxy luminosity apparent from both the @xmath48 relation and the new results presented here , suggests a correlation exists between radio luminosity and black - hole mass within the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples .",
    "this issue is discussed further in section [ correlations ] .",
    "the best - fitting scalelength from the two - dimensional modelling of each individual member of the zp5 sample is listed in table [ tab3 ] , while the mean and median values for the four radio - galaxy sub - samples and the full zp5 sample are listed in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "the full range of scalelengths displayed by the objects in the zp5 sample is @xmath49 kpc , with a mean value of @xmath50 kpc .",
    "scalelengths of this size clearly place the radio galaxies in the rgime of brightest cluster galaxies ( eg . graham et al .",
    "1996 ; hoessel , oergerle & schneider 1987 ) and a comparison of the zp5 host galaxies with the properties of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) is pursued further in section [ bcg_comp ] .",
    "furthermore , in section 6 the scalelength results for the 3crr sub - sample are combined with existing literature results on 3c - class galaxies to search for any evidence for dynamical evolution amongst the most powerful radio galaxies within the redshift interval @xmath9 .",
    "in common with the results regarding the zp5 host - galaxy luminosities , an inspection of table [ tab4 ] reveals an apparent correlation between mean scalelength and radio luminosity within the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs sub - samples .",
    "this is entirely as expected given the correlation between host - galaxy and radio luminosity discussed above , and the well known correlation between host luminosity and scalelength among early - type galaxies ( e.g. @xmath51 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 )      early - type galaxies are known to exist on a two - dimensional manifold ( fundamental plane ) in the three - dimensional parameter space defined by effective scalelength , the mean surface brightness within the effective scalelength and the central stellar - velocity dispersion ( eg .",
    "dressler , lynden - bell & burstein 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) . at present",
    "we are engaged in obtaining stellar - velocity dispersion measurements for the zp5 sample to investigate their location on the fundamental plane , and to estimate the masses of their central black holes via the @xmath52 correlation ( willott et al .",
    ", in prep ) . however , armed with just the scalelength and surface brightness parameters for each host galaxy , it is possible to examine the photometric projection of the full fundamental plane , the so - called kormendy or @xmath8 relation ( kormendy 1977 ) .",
    "the kormendy relation for the zp5 sample is shown in the top panel of fig [ fig5 ] . in this panel",
    "the @xmath53 values of the zp5 objects have been k - corrected and corrected for @xmath40 surface - brightness dimming , but have not been corrected for passive evolution . using the iterative @xmath54 fitexy routine , which takes account of errors in both parameters ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , the best - fitting form of the kormendy relation for the non - evolutionary corrected zp5 sample is : @xmath55 in the middle panel of fig [ fig5 ] the same zp5 data are repeated , along with the 73 low - redshift radio galaxies from the fundamental plane study of bettoni et al .",
    "the best - fitting relation to bettoni et al .",
    "sample is : @xmath56 given that the bettoni et al .",
    "sample is virtually at redshift zero , the vertical offset between the kormendy relation of the bettoni et al .",
    "sample and that of the zp5 sample is a direct indication of the amount of luminosity evolution between @xmath38 and @xmath57 . if the two samples are fitted with a kormendy relation of fixed slope 3.52 ( intermediate to their two independent fits ) then the best - fitting intercepts are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for the zp5 and bettoni et al .",
    "samples respectively .",
    "this directly implies @xmath60 magnitudes of @xmath37band luminosity evolution between z=0.5 and z=0 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the evolutionary corrections derived from the @xmath61 bruzual & charlot model , which predicts a mean value of @xmath62 magnitudes of passive luminosity evolution for the zp5 sample .    in the bottom panel of fig [ fig5 ] the low - redshift radio galaxies of bettoni et al .",
    "are again plotted , together with the now evolutionary corrected zp5 objects .",
    "the solid line shows the best - fitting relation to the combined sample which has the form : @xmath63 which is in excellent agreement with the recent determination of the kormendy relation slope ( @xmath64 ) for 9000 @xmath65 early - type galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) by bernardi et al .",
    "in this section we focus on our new results for the 3crr zp5 sub - sample , combining them with previous work in the literature , to re - examine the issue of the evolution of 3c - class radio galaxies from @xmath66 through to the present day .",
    "it has been known for some twenty years now that powerful radio galaxies follow a tight correlation between their apparent @xmath36band magnitudes and redshift ( lilly & longair 1984 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this @xmath45 relation consistent with the data assumes that the radio galaxies were formed at high redshift ( @xmath67 ) , either in a monolithic collapse or via hierarchical merging , and have been evolving passively thereafter .",
    "however , this interpretation of the @xmath45 relation was challenged by best , longair & rttgering ( 1998 ) who argued that the apparent passive appearance of the @xmath45 relation was in fact a conspiracy .",
    "based on evidence in the literature that points to higher redshift 3c radio galaxies ( @xmath68 ) inhabiting significantly richer cluster environments ( hill & lilly 1991 , best 2000 ) than their low - redshift counterparts ( eg .",
    "prestage & peacock 1988 ; lilly & prestage 1987 ) , best et al . proposed that 3c radio galaxies at @xmath69 and @xmath65 followed different evolutionary histories , and are seen as powerful radio sources at points within those histories at which they possessed similar stellar masses ( @xmath70 ) . under this interpretation ,",
    "higher redshift 3c galaxies would form first , via merger events within their rich cluster environments , reaching the required stellar mass by @xmath69 , before evolving passively to form the radio - dormant brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) seen at @xmath65 . in contrast",
    ", the 3c radio galaxies at low redshift would reach the required stellar mass much later , via merging within their poorer cluster environments . the argument in favour of this interpretation of the @xmath45 relation",
    "was further strengthened by best et al.s results suggesting that the scalelengths of @xmath69 3c galaxies were significantly larger than seen in low - redshift 3c galaxies , and much more compatible with the characteristic sizes of low - redshift bcgs .    the evidence suggesting that 3c radio galaxies at @xmath71 have significantly larger scalelengths than typical of low - redshift 3c galaxies was re - examined using a full two - dimensional analysis of the best et al . hst imaging data by mclure & dunlop ( 2000 ) .",
    "comparison of the results of this analysis with previous results based on hst imaging of 3c - class radio galaxies at @xmath34 ( dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; mclure et al .",
    "1999 ) indicated that 3c galaxies at both redshifts had very similar characteristic scalelengths ( @xmath72 kpc ; @xmath73 ) . here",
    "we can extend this comparison by including both the new results for the zp5 3crr sub - sample , and those for the twenty 3c galaxies included in the bettoni et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample .",
    "the scalelength results for the @xmath74 sub - sample ( bettoni et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the @xmath30 and @xmath75 sub - samples ( mclure & dunlop 2000 ) were all derived by fitting classical @xmath28 de vaucouleurs @xmath76 surface - brightness distributions . consequently , in order to perform the scalelength comparison we also adopt the scalelength results for the zp5 3crr sub - sample obtained by restricting the fitting procedure to @xmath28 .    under this restriction the mean scalelength of the zp5 3crr",
    "sub - sample is @xmath77 kpc . when converted to our adopted cosmology",
    "the equivalent values for the @xmath74 , @xmath30 and @xmath75 samples are @xmath78 kpc , @xmath79 kpc and @xmath80 kpc respectively . in conclusion , these results show no indication of any trend for scalelength to vary with redshift in the interval @xmath9 .      in panel",
    "a of fig [ fig6 ] we show the kormendy relation for all four 3c radio - galaxy samples .",
    "the best - fitting relation to the combined sample is : @xmath81 where all four samples have been corrected for @xmath82 surface - brightness dimming , and have had both k - corrections and evolutionary corrections applied as described in section [ lum ] .",
    "panel a of fig [ fig6 ] demonstrates that within the redshift interval @xmath83 there is no obvious evidence for any dynamical evolution , as would be indicated by scalelength or surface - brightness evolution , other than that expected from purely passive evolution of the stellar populations .",
    "however , although we find no evidence for dynamical evolution of the class of agn host galaxies which harbour powerful 3c - class radio sources in the redshift interval @xmath83 , dynamical evolution of the individual host galaxies themselves within this redshift range can not be ruled out .",
    "panel b of fig [ fig6 ] shows that the redshift evolution of the mean absolute magnitudes of the four sub - samples is also consistent with purely passive evolution .",
    "however , it should also be pointed out that these results do not require that all 3c radio galaxies are formed in a monolithic collapse at high redshift , simply that the proto - galactic components which eventually form the host galaxies are formed reasonably co - evally , and that the vast majority of merger activity be completed at @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , neither are the results presented in this section inconsistent with what would be expected under the @xmath45 interpretation proposed by best et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "a satisfactory discrimination between the two interpretations of the @xmath45 relation will rely on a consistent evaluation of the relative richness of the respective cluster environments at low and high redshift .",
    "unfortunately , much of the work which has previously been done on the cluster environments of radio galaxies , particularly at low redshift , has relied on statistical determinations from single - filter imaging which are known to be subject to large uncertainties ( eg .",
    "barr et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , upon completion of our int wide field camera follow - up observations of the zp5 sample , together with our existing observations of radio - galaxy samples at @xmath30 and @xmath75 , we will be able to consistently investigate the evolution in the cluster environments of powerful radio galaxies , by using three - colour imaging to successfully separate true cluster members from foreground and background contaminants ( jarvis et al . ; mclure et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the results regarding the scalelengths and integrated luminosities of the zp5 sample presented in section 5 suggest that the host galaxies of the zp5 sample are directly comparable with brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2001b ) who concluded that the hosts of powerful radio - loud agn at @xmath30 were directly comparable to the central bcgs of abell class 0 clusters . in this section",
    "we explore this issue further via comparison with the findings of the hst imaging study of @xmath1 bcgs by nelson et al .",

    "( 2002 ) investigated the characteristic sizes of a heterogeneous sample of 16 bcgs , drawn from both x - ray and optically selected cluster samples , using two - dimensional modelling of hst nicmos and wfpc2 imaging with the publically available gim2d package ( simard 1998 ) .",
    "the mean redshift of the nelson et al .",
    "sample is @xmath85 , making it ideal for comparison with the results for the zp5 sample .",
    "after conversion to our chosen cosmology , and correction for the effect of colour gradients ( nelson et al .",

    "bcgs to be @xmath86 kpc , in excellent agreement with the scalelength distribution of the zp5 sample ; @xmath87 kpc .",
    "given that the results for both the zp5 and nelson et al .",
    "samples are derived from similar two - dimensional modelling of hst imaging , of samples with identical redshift distributions , this can be taken as good evidence that the hosts of the zp5 sample are indistinguishable from those of bcgs at @xmath1 .    however , if the zp5 scalelength results are compared to those determined for nearby abell bcgs , the conclusions are more ambiguous . in fig [ fig7 ]",
    "we show a histogram of the effective scalelengths determined from one - dimensional @xmath76 fits to the @xmath37band surface - brightness profiles of 119 @xmath74 abell cluster bcgs by graham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , together with the equivalent histogram for the zp5 sample .",
    "the mean and median scalelengths determined by graham et al . for the abell bcgs are @xmath88 kpc and 18.5 kpc respectively ( after conversion to our adopted cosmology ) .",
    "the equivalent figures for the zp5 sample are @xmath89 kpc and 12.8 kpc respectively .",
    "an application of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test finds the zp5 and abell cluster scalelength distributions to be drawn from different parent populations at high significance ( @xmath90 )    in fig [ fig8 ] the kormendy relation for the zp5 sample and the abell bcgs is shown .",
    "it is clear from fig [ fig8 ] that the host galaxies of the zp5 sample are fully consistent with the kormendy relation for @xmath74 abell bcgs , although the zp5 sample , and @xmath21 bcgs in general ( nelson et al . 2002 ) , appear to be devoid of galaxies with scalelengths @xmath91 kpc .",
    "however , the radio galaxies comprising the zp5 sample are expected to inhabit a wide range of environments ( hill & lilly 1991 ) , with previous results suggesting that the mean environmental richness should be comparable to low - redshift abell class 0 clusters . indeed , if the scalelength comparison with the graham et al .",
    "abell bcgs is restricted to only those objects in abell class 0 clusters ( 67 of 119 objects ) then the difference between the two distributions is only significant at the @xmath92 level ( @xmath93 ) , in agreement with hill & lilly ( 1991 ) and mclure & dunlop ( 2001b ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the luminosities and scalelengths of the zp5 sample show that the radio galaxies are consistent with the typical properties of bcgs at @xmath21 , which are in turn comparable with the central galaxies of local abell class 0 clusters .",
    "we note here that , as previously highlighted by yates , miller & peacock ( 1989 ) , 3c295 is clearly an exceptional object in terms of it s cluster environment , which is known to be directly comparable to the richest clusters at low redshift ( hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "indeed , 3c295 is a factor of two more optically luminous than any other member of the 3crr sub - sample and , as will be seen in section 9 , also inhabits an extreme region of the @xmath94 plane .",
    "as discussed in section [ results ] , the morphological analysis of the hst imaging data clearly indicates that the zp5 radio galaxies are close to being classical ellipticals .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to directly link the hosts of the zp5 sample with @xmath65 ellipticals via the application of passive evolutionary corrections . consequently , under the assumption that , except for passive evolution , the @xmath10 relation does not evolve between @xmath38 and @xmath57 we can proceed to estimate the central black - hole masses of the zp5 sample using the correlation between black - hole mass and bulge luminosity observed at low redshift .    for this calculation",
    "we adopt the @xmath10 relation as derived by mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) for a combined sample of 72 agn host galaxies and 18 low - redshift ( @xmath95 ) inactive ellipticals with black - hole mass measurements derived from either stellar or gas dynamics : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the absolute r - cousins bulge luminosity ( corrected to our adopted cosmology ) .",

    "2003 ) it is clear that truly powerful radio - loud agn , those capable of producing kpc - scale jets , are powered by black holes with masses greater than @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , given that radio - loud agn are drawn from the high - mass end of the black - hole mass function , the results of these studies suggest the existence of a maximum black - hole mass of @xmath104 ( c.f .",
    "this black - hole mass limit is in agreement with the maximum mass measured via gas or stellar dynamics in the local universe ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ; tadhunter et al .",
    "2003 ) and the limit implied from broad emission - line based black - hole mass estimates for @xmath105 sdss quasars at @xmath106 ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) .",
    "we note here that graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered a correlation between central black - hole mass and the srsic morphological parameter @xmath3 for a sample of 20 local galaxies with black - hole masses measured via gas or stellar dynamics .",
    "this correlation displays a comparable level of scatter ( @xmath107 dex ) to that of the @xmath52 relation ( eg .",
    "tremaine et al .",
    "due to the fact that black - hole mass in early - type galaxies also correlates with bulge luminosity with comparably low scatter ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) , it is expected that a correlation will exist between the @xmath3 parameter and host - galaxy luminosity .",
    "no such correlation is observed in the full zp5 sample ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "it is possible that the properties of two of the zp5 sample , toot 0013 + 3459 and 3c295 ( see table 3 ) , may have resulted in the determination of anomalously large @xmath3 parameters for their luminosities .",
    "however , following the exclusion of these two objects the correlation between @xmath3 and host luminosity is still only marginally significant ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "the principal reason for this discrepancy may simply be that we have a much smaller dynamic range in @xmath3 compared to the graham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) study .",
    "however , we also note that the graham et al .",
    "correlation between @xmath3 and black - hole mass would imply a mean black - hole mass for the zp5 sample of @xmath111 , for our determination of @xmath112 .",
    "this is significantly different to the figure of @xmath113 determined from the @xmath10 relation which , using the graham et al .",
    "@xmath114 correlation , would imply @xmath115 .",
    "the question of whether or not black - hole mass is correlated with radio emission in agn has been the focus of a great deal of attention in the literature recently ( eg . dunlop et al . 2003 ; lacy et al . 2001 ; ho 2002 ; woo & urry 2002 ) . using broad emission - line based virial black - hole mass estimates lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) investigated the radio luminosity - black - hole mass relationship for a combined sample composed of objects from the first bright quasar ( fbq ) and pg quasar surveys .",
    "the results of this study showed a strong correlation between black - hole mass and 5-ghz radio luminosity of the form @xmath116 over a dynamic range of some 6 decades in radio luminosity and 4 decades in black - hole mass . by combining their black - hole mass estimates , derived from hst imaging of a sample of 33 agn at @xmath30 , with those of the lacy et al .",
    "study , dunlop & mclure ( 2003 ) demonstrated that the 5-ghz radio luminosity of both agn and quiescent nearby galaxies appears to be confined between two radio - power limits .",
    "the lower radio - power limit defines the minimum radio luminosity that can be emitted by a given black - hole mass , and is well described by a relation of the form @xmath117 , in good agreement with the correlation originally observed for nearby quiescent galaxies by franceschini , vercellone & fabian ( 1998 ) .",
    "the upper radio - power limit proposed by dunlop & mclure ( 2003 ) appears to be well described by a relation of the same functional form , offset from the lower limit by some 5 decades in radio luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the recent studies of ho ( 2002 ) and woo & urry ( 2002 ) find no convincing evidence for a correlation between black - hole mass and radio luminosity , in samples comprising a range in nuclear activity from local quiescent galaxies up to and including powerful quasars .    in this section",
    "we investigate whether there is a correlation between black - hole mass and radio luminosity within the zp5 radio - galaxy sample .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , the majority of which have been based on high frequency ( 5-ghz ) radio luminosity , the zp5 radio - galaxy sample allows us to test for a correlation between black - hole mass and extended low - frequency ( 151-mhz ) radio luminosity .",
    "this distinction is potentially important given that @xmath118 is less affected by beaming than @xmath119 ( eg . jarvis & mclure 2002 ) and has a close relationship to the time - averaged kinetic energy of the jets ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "the results presented thus far are consistent with a picture in which extended low - frequency radio luminosity scales roughly with host - galaxy luminosity / mass . in combination with the latest determination of the @xmath45 relation ( willott et al .",
    "2003 ) it appears that the most powerful 3c - class radio galaxies reside in galaxies with @xmath37band luminosities of @xmath120 , while the lower - luminosity 6c and 7c - class radio galaxies typically inhabit hosts with luminosities of @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .    at present",
    "it is unclear how the toot sub - sample fits within this picture .",
    "it can be seen from the results presented in table [ tab4 ] that the toot galaxies do not appear to follow the rough scaling between extended radio luminosity and host - galaxy luminosity apparent in the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs sub - samples .",
    "indeed , the mean luminosity of the toot sub - sample ( @xmath123 ) is greater than that of both the 7crs and 6ce sub - samples , and is consistent with the low - redshift results of owen & laing ( 1989 ) that fat double / jet / fri sources reside in hosts which are on average @xmath124 magnitudes brighter than those of classical double / frii sources of comparable radio luminosity . however , as was mentioned in section 2 , the toot sub - sample was drawn from a preliminary version of the survey and it is unclear at the time of writing to what extent the current toot sub - sample is biased by the exclusion of the optically faintest sources .    with this in mind , panel",
    "a of fig [ fig10 ] shows 151-mhz radio luminosity versus estimated black - hole mass for the full zp5 sample , where the black - hole mass estimates have been derived via the mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) @xmath10 relation as described in section 8 .",
    "taken as a whole , there is only a weak ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) correlation between black - hole mass and radio luminosity within the zp5 sample .",
    "however , as suggested previously , it can be seen from panel a of fig [ fig10 ] that the apparent weakness of the @xmath127 correlation displayed by the full zp5 sample is due , at least in part , to the inclusion of the eleven toot objects .    to investigate the possible influence of radio structure and nuclear spectral type we have also plotted in fig [ fig10 ] the @xmath127 relation for two sub - sets of the zp5 sample . in panel b of fig [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the @xmath127 relation for those objects which display high - excitation nuclear spectra ( heg ) only . as is suggested by the figure , this sub - sample displays a fairly strong correlation which is significant at the @xmath128 level ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) , although this drops in significance to only @xmath131 following the exclusion of 3c295 and 7crs 1731 + 6638 ( objects highlighted with crosses in fig [ fig10 ] ) . in panel c of fig [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the @xmath127 relation for the zp5 objects with classical double ( cd ) radio structures only , effectively excluding the toot sub - sample .",
    "this correlation is significant at the @xmath132-level ( @xmath133 ) , a result which is confirmed by the application of the generalized kendall s tau test ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) , although again we note that the significance drops to only @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) following the exclusion of 3c295 and 7crs 1731 + 6638 .",
    "it is clear from these results that a @xmath13 correlation does exist between black - hole mass and low - frequency 151-mhz radio luminosity within the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples , although the scatter in radio luminosity at a given black - hole mass is large ( @xmath138 dex ) .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the lacy et al .",
    "( 2001 ) study of the @xmath139 relation in broad - line quasars , a study which covered a much larger dynamic range in black - hole mass .",
    "moreover , this result is also consistent with the hypothesis proposed by dunlop & mclure ( 2003 ) that the radio luminosity which can be produced by a given black - hole mass may be bounded by upper and lower limits separated by several orders of magnitude .",
    "indeed , given that theoretical models indicate that the radio luminosity of agn , in addition to black - hole mass , should also be related to both accretion rate and black - hole spin ( eg .",
    "meier 2003 ) , it is perhaps unsurprising that the @xmath127 correlation is not stronger .",
    "furthermore , at present it is unclear whether the objects which do not follow the @xmath127 correlation , predominantly the lower - luminosity toot sub - sample , do so because of their leg nature , their fat double / jet radio structures , or alternatively , as a result of a selection effect which biases the toot sub - sample towards the inclusion of objects with larger host luminosities / black - hole masses .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the connection between the radio properties and black - hole masses of the zp5 sample will be pursued in a future paper ( mitchell et al . , in prep ) .",
    "the results of a detailed analysis of deep , high - resolution hst images of a sample of 41 radio galaxies which spans three decades in radio luminosity at @xmath21 have been presented .",
    "the host - galaxy properties derived from two - dimensional image modelling have been discussed and compared to existing results in the literature .",
    "the principle conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the morphologies of the host galaxies of all four radio - galaxy sub - samples are found to be largely consistent with a canonical elliptical - galaxy @xmath76 surface - brightness distribution .",
    "no trend is detected for host - galaxy morphology to vary significantly with radio luminosity .",
    "the luminosities of the host galaxies are found to be consistent with those of galaxies drawn from the bright end of the local cluster - galaxy luminosity function , in the range @xmath140 , with a mean value of @xmath141 .",
    "3 .   the radio - galaxy hosts are found to lie on the same kormendy ( @xmath8 ) relation as powerful @xmath65 radio galaxies , after allowing for the effects of passive evolution of their stellar populations under the assumption of a high formation redshift ( @xmath1423 ) .",
    "4 .   by combining the new results on @xmath21 3crr galaxies with previous results in the literature",
    ", it is found that there is no evidence for dynamical evolution among the hosts of 3c - class radio galaxies in terms of scalelength , luminosity and kormendy relation in the redshift interval @xmath9 .",
    "however , although no evidence is found for dynamical evolution among the hosts of the most powerful radio sources as a class , dynamical evolution of the individual host galaxies themselves can not be ruled out .",
    "the scalelengths of the zp5 host galaxies are found to be consistent with those of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) at the same cosmic epoch ( @xmath21 ) . when compared to local abell cluster bcgs the zp5 host galaxies are found to be a factor of @xmath143 smaller on average",
    ". however , when the comparison is restricted to local clusters of abell class 0 only , the zp5 and bcg scalelength distributions are found to be statistically indistinguishable .",
    "6 .   converting the derived host - galaxy luminosities into black - hole mass estimates using the local @xmath10 relation",
    "predicts that the host galaxies harbour central black - holes in the mass range @xmath144 , with a geometric mean of @xmath99 .",
    "7 .   significant correlations ( @xmath13 ) are found between black - hole mass and extended low - frequency radio luminosity for sub - samples of the zp5 objects which have either classical double ( cd ) radio structures or high - excitation nuclear spectra ( heg ) .",
    "however , at present we are unable to determine whether the objects which do not follow the same correlation , predominantly the lower - luminosity toot sub - sample , do so because of their leg spectra , fat double / jet radio structures , or alternatively , as a result of selection effects biasing the toot sub - sample towards the inclusion of objects with higher host luminosities / black - hole masses .",
