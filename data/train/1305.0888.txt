    "leads to inequality @xmath116 and almost coinciding @xmath11 . to our opinion",
    "it means that fitting procedure is most sensitive to the intermediate momentum interval , where both set of data are in agreement . as for parametrizations discussed in introduction ,",

    "it is clear that only new high statistic experiments can resolve this problem .",
    "the emergence of `` growing '' data was so unexpected that , at first glance , it seemed that it is impossible to explain such behavior from the field theoretical point of view .",
    "however , in dorokhov:2009dg , radyushkin:2009zg , polyakov:2009je , bystritskiy:2009bk , dorokhov:2010zzb there was noted that , if such `` growing '' behavior exists , then it may be related to unusual properties of the pion distribution amplitude in the vicinity of its edge points . this behavior was conditionally called as `` flat '' . in this case",
    "the inverse moment of the pion distribution amplitude is not well defined . in particular ,",
    "such behavior may be modeled if to assume that the pion is almost structureless . in @xcite ( and later in some other works ) it was shown that babar data can be described in the model with momentum independent quark mass and quark - pion coupling by using only one parameter : the constituent quark mass @xmath11 if its value is taken as @xmath12 mev .",
    "this number was considered as a rather small from phenomenological point of view .",
    "one of the main motivation of the present work is to see how sensitive this parameter to gluonic radiative corrections , when fit the babar and belle data .",
    "the result is that the mass parameter becomes a bit heavier @xmath114 mev and the quality of the fit becomes better .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , a more advanced model , with momentum dependent quark mass and quark - pion vertex , has the same qualitative features as the model considered in this work . in the model @xcite ,",
    "the soften quark propagator and quark - pion vertex lead to the single logarithmic asymptotic dependence on @xmath5 instead of the double logarithmic behavior , if the quark - pion vertex so that it corresponds to the `` flat '' pion distribution amplitude . the pion distribution amplitude",
    "even can vanish at the end - points , but still simulate the logarithmic growth in rather wide range of momentum transfer including quite large values of it . when fit babar data , the mass parameter is still close to @xmath120 mev .",
    "the calculations given in the present paper can be extended by consideration not only momentum dependent nonperturbative quark propagator and quark - pion vertex , but also momentum dependent nonperturbative gluon propagator .    finally note that there are available data obtained by the babar collaboration for the @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 transition form factors .",
    "the comparison of our model calculations with data for these mesons is given in @xcite . from our point of view",
    "the data show tendency that with increase of the meson mass the form factor changes its behavior from the `` growing '' regime to the `` constant '' regime . in the framework of our model",
    "this change of behavior is related to strong dependence of the shape of the meson distribution amplitude on the meson mass . with growing meson mass",
    "the meson distribution amplitude changes its shape from the `` flat '' one to the `` @xmath124-function '' shape for heavy mesons @xcite .",

    "<S> we calculate the transition form factor of the neutral pion where one photon is virtual and another photon is real in the model where the light constituent quark mass and the quark - pion vertex are taken to be momentum independent . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections to the lowest order triangle quark feynman amplitude are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the resummation of the lowest radiative corrections to the virtual photon vertex is done by applying the sudakov exponential hypothesis . using fitting parameters , the quark mass and the strong coupling constant , the results on the pion transition form factor are compared with existing data published by cello , cleo , babar and belle collaborations . </S>"
