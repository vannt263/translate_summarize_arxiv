    "_ multi - label learning _",
    "has drawn much attention in recent years , where each data example can be assigned with multiple labels simultaneously .",
    "multi - label learning has a wide range of real - world applications .",
    "for example , in text categorization , one text document can belong to multiple categories , such as _ sports _ and _ entertainment _ ; researchers in text mining are interested in learning a model that can automatically predict a set of categories for each text document .",
    "similarly , in image annotation tasks , one image can contain multiple objects or tags , and researchers in computer vision are interested in automatically predicting tags / objects for unlabeled image collections .",
    "conventional approaches for multi - label learning @xcite mainly focus on utilizing the correlations among different class labels to facilitate the learning process .",
    "it is usually assumed , explicitly or implicitly , that all the label sets for training instances are fully labeled , _",
    "i.e. _ , all the labels within a label set of an instance should be completely annotated by a labeler without any missing labels . however , in many real - world multi - label learning tasks , it is very hard or expensive to get a fully labeled dataset , especially when the number of classes and/or instances are very large .",
    "it is usually much easier to get a set of partially labeled data , where some ground - truth labels for training instances can be missed by the labeler .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig_eg ] , we should an image that contain many tags in its ground - truth label set .",
    "it usually happens that the labeler may only want to annotate a small number of the labels for the image , instead of going through all possible labels in the vocabulary . in this example , many true labels of the image are missed by the labeler .",
    "if we directly use existing multi - label learning methods on such datasets , the missing labels in the training data will be treated as negative examples , and the performances of multi - label classification will degenerate greatly due to the simple treatment .    in this paper , we study the problem of large - scale multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments , as shown in figure  [ fig_eg2 ] . despite its value and significance , large - scale multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments",
    "is a much more challenging task due to the specific characteristics of the task .",
    "the reasons are listed as follows .    *",
    "_ incomplete label assignments_. most existing multi - label learning methods , such as ml - knn @xcite and rank - svm @xcite , assume that the training data are fully labeled .",
    "however , in most real - world applications , the label assignments for training instances can be incomplete .",
    "thus we can not simply treat the missing labels as negative examples .",
    "a label that is not annotated by the labeler can still belong the ground - truth label set .",
    "we need to consider the incomplete label assignments explicitly while building our models on training data . * _ label correlations_. positive and unlabeled learning methods @xcite can usually handle the cases when the label assignments are partially missing under single label settings .",
    "however , in multi - label learning problems , each instance can be assigned with multiple labels .",
    "different class labels are correlated with each other , instead of being independent .",
    "we need to exploit the label correlations to facility the learning process of multi - label classification . * _ scalability_. previous approaches on multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments @xcite are mainly designed for small / moderate - sized datasets .",
    "however , many real - world problems involve a large number of instances . in large - scale datasets , it is even more typical to encounter the incomplete labeling issues due to the huge cost of labeling . in these cases ,",
    "it is even more important that the learning method can handle large - scale datasets , with time complexities that are linear to both the number of instances and the number of classes .    in order to solve the above issues",
    ", we propose a novel solution , called mpu , to learn from partially labeled training instances and can exploit label correlations to facilitate the learning process .",
    "different from previous work , the proposed mpu can scale to large - scale problems with time complexity that is linear in both the number instances and number of classes . empirical studies on real - world datasets show that the proposed method can significantly boost the performance of multi - label classification by considering missing labels and incorporating label correlations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the preliminary concepts , giving the problem analysis and present the mpu approach in section  [ sec_model ] . then section  [ sec : experiment ] reports the experiment results .",
    "we briefly review on related works of multi - label learning and learning from missing labels in section  [ sec : relatedwork ] . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude the paper .    [",
    "tab : notation ]    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]      in order to evaluate the performance of multi - label learning by the models , we follow previous works @xcite by using _ micro - f1 _ as the performance measure .",
    "suppose that a multi - label dataset is @xmath0 , which consists of @xmath1 multi - label instances .",
    "@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be a multi - label classifier , and its predicted label set for @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "_ micro - f1 _ is the harmonic mean of _ micro - precision _ and _ micro - recall_. the _ micro - precision _ is the micro - average of precision over all labels .",
    "similarly , _",
    "micro - recall _ is the micro - average of recall overal all possible labels .",
    "@xmath7 the larger the value of _ micro - f1 _ , the better the performance of multi - label classification model .    all experiments are conducted on machines with intel xeonquad - core cpus of 2.26 ghz and 36  gb ram .      in order to study the effectiveness of the proposed approach ,",
    "we compare our method with different baseline methods , including a large scale multi - label learning method , a multi - label learning method with missing labels and a positive and an unlabeled learning method .",
    "the compared methods are summarized as follows :    * _ large - scale multi - label learning ( m3l ) _ @xcite : the first baseline method is a multi - label classification method for large scale problems .",
    "we compared the m3l methods with two different kernels , _",
    "i.e. _ , linear kernel ( denoted as m3l linear ) and rbf kernel ( denoted as m3l rbf ) , separately .",
    "* _ positive and unlabeled learning ( elkan08 ) _ @xcite : the second baseline method is a pu learning method which handle the cases where some positive instances can be missed by the labeler .",
    "this method is originally designed for binary classification problems .",
    "we use the binary decomposition method to solve multi - label classification problems by training one model over each class @xcite . *",
    "_ multi - label learning with missing labels ( well ) _",
    "@xcite : we also compare with another baseline which are designed for multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments .",
    "the method can train a model on weakly labeled multi - label instances , and predict complete label sets on testing data .",
    "it can handle moderate - size datasets , but can not scale to large - scale datasets .",
    "we use default parameter settings for this method . * _ large - scale multi - label learning with missing labels ( mpu ) _ : the proposed method in this paper for large - scale multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments .",
    "mpu can explicitly consider label correlations to facilitate multi - label learning process when a part of the ground - truth labels are missing in the label set .",
    "for simipicity , we set the number of stacking levels to the minium value 2 .",
    "we first study the effectiveness of the proposed mpu method on multi - label classification with incomplete label assignment . in our experiment",
    ", @xmath8-fold cross validation is performed on the small data set to evaluate the multi - label classification performances . in each round of the cross validation",
    ", the instances are partitioned into two groups : 9 folds are used as training data , the remaining fold is used as testing data . in order to simulate the incomplete label assignments , we randomly sample and remove a subset of the labels from each of label sets in training data according to a ratio , called _ missing rate_. for example , if the missing rate is 20% , we randomly sample 20% of the labels from the ground - truth labels of training instances and remove them from the train set .",
    "the higher the missing rate , the more ground - truth labels are missed by the labeler in the training set .",
    "we report the average results of 10-fold cross validation on the dataset .",
    "we study the performance of the proposed mpu method on multi - label classification with different number of missing rates : 0% , 10% , 20% , _ etc .",
    "_ when the missing rate is 0% , it represents the setting of conventional multi - label learning where the training instances are fully labeled . in real - world multi - label learning",
    ", we can usually only have a small number of labels annotated in the label set .",
    "the results of all compared methods are shown in figure  [ fig_exp_small ] .",
    "firstly , we can observe that when the training set is fully labeled ( _ i.e. _ , missing rate is 0% ) , all multi - label learning methods outperform the single - label learning method , elkan08 .",
    "in general , these results support the importance of exploiting correlations among different class labels in multi - label learning problems .",
    "because the method elkan08 is based upon one - vs - all decomposition , where different labels are assumed to be independent , thus it can not work well in multi - label learning tasks when different labels are correlated .",
    "we also observe that when the missing rate increases , the performances of m3l decrease very quickly . while all the other methods that can consider missing labels are relatively stable in their performances .",
    "this is because m3l is designed for supervised multi - label learning problems , which assumes all the training instances are fully labeled .",
    "when a label @xmath9 is missed in the label set of a training instance , m3l will consider the instance as a negative example for the label @xmath9 .",
    "this result can support the importance of considering missing labels in the training data , by assuming that some labels in the ground - truth label set can be missed by the labeler .",
    "thus , for each single class label , the ` negative ' examples are no longer pure negative examples , but are mixture of both positive examples and negative examples .",
    "we further observe that our proposed method mpu outperforms all the other methods on all missing rates .",
    "mpu can estimate the missing rate of the training data automatically , and can utilize label correlations to improve the classification performances .",
    "this result can support the importance of considering both label correlations and missing labels at the same time .              in our second experiment",
    ", we evaluate the efficiency of different multi - label learning methods on a large - scale dataset , which consists of around 800k instances . in this section ,",
    "we compare both the micro - f1 performances and running time in the training step .",
    "we reported the performances of micro - f1 in figure  [ fig_exp_large ] .",
    "we only showed the methods that can finish running within a week .",
    "the methods show similar properties to those in the small datset .",
    "the m3l method initially has good performances when the training set is fully labeled .",
    "however when the missing rate increases , the performances of m3l drop very fast .",
    "the performances of mpu method is quite stable . when the missing rate increases , the performances are still pretty good .",
    "mpu can outperform m3l when the missing rate is greater than 30% .",
    "we also show the training time of all methods in both dataset in figure  [ fig_exp_time ] .",
    "we can observe that both mpu and m3l can scale well to large - scale datasets . while the remaining methods such as well can not scale to datasets in this size .",
    "it is because the time complexity of well is @xmath10 in the number of training instances ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "both mpu and m3l are linear @xmath11 in the number of instances .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first work addressing the problem of large - scale multi - label classification with incomplete label assignments .",
    "our work is related to both multi - label learning techniques and positive and unlabeled learning .",
    "we briefly discuss both of them .",
    "multi - label learning corresponds to the classification problem where each instance can be assigned to multiple labels simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the key challenge of multi - label learning is the large space of all label sets , _",
    "i.e. _ the power set of all labels . in order to tackle this challenging task , many multi - label learning approaches focus on utilizing the labels correlations to facilitate the learning process .",
    "conventional multi - label learning approaches can be roughly categorized as follows : ( a ) _ one - vs - all _ approaches : this type of approaches treat different labels as independent by converting the multi - label problem into multiple binary classification problems ( one for each label ) @xcite .",
    "zhang and zhou@xcite proposed ml - knn , a binary method by extending the @xmath12nn algorithm to a multi - label problems using _ maximum a posteriori _ ( map ) principle to determine the label set predictions .",
    "( b ) _ pairwise _ correlations : this type of approaches mainly use the pairwise relationships among different labels to facilitate the learning process @xcite .",
    "elisseeff and weston @xcite proposed rank - svm , a kernel method by minimizing _ ranking loss _ to rank label pairs .",
    "( c ) _ high - order _ correlations @xcite : this type of approaches can utilize higher order relationships among different labels .",
    "examples include random subset ensemble approaches @xcite , bayesian network approach @xcite and full - order approaches @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite studied the large - scale multi - label leanring problems , and proposed an efficient approach m3l .",
    "in addition , multi - label learning with incomplete label assignment has also been studied on small / moderate - size datasets @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite proposed an approach well to infer missing labels in multi - label learning under transductive settings .",
    "our work is also related to another line of research , called positive and unlabeled learning , or pu learning @xcite .",
    "pu learning corresponds to the binary classification problems where some positive samples can be mislabeled .",
    "thus in the training set , only positive and unlabeled examples are available , no reliable negative examples are given in the training set .",
    "many previous works on pu learning focus on estimating reliable negative examples from the unlabeled dataset , and utilize the estimated labels to improve the classification performances , the work in @xcite proposed a method based upon biased svm . initially all the unlabeled instances are treated as negative examples .",
    "but the cost of classifying an unlabeled example with positive label is lower than that of predicting positive examples with negative labels .",
    "elkan and noto @xcite provided a statistic model for positive and unlabeled learning .",
    "it is assumed that the ground - truth labels are randomly sampled into the training set according to a constant factor .",
    "the random sampling process is assumed to be independent from everything else , such as features of the instances .",
    "the constant factor can be estimated using cross - validation process on the training data .",
    "then most conventional classification models can be modified according to the factor to consider the missing labels .",
    "in this paper , we have described and studied the problem of large - scale multi - label learning with incomplete label assignments .",
    "we have studied two real - world datasets , one small and one large to evaluate the performance of our proposed method .",
    "different from previous works in multi - label learning , we consider missing labels in the training set and label correlations simultaneously . by",
    "explicitly consider the missing labels using positive and unlabeled learning model , and label correlations using stacking models , our method can effectively boost the performance of multi - label classification with partially labeled training data .",
