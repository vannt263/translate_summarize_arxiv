    "mass outflows of ionized gas from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have been detected in the majority of seyfert 1 galaxies observed in the uv ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ; kriss 2002 ) and x - rays ( reynolds 1997 , george et al .",
    "the outflows are revealed through absorption lines that are blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocities of the host galaxies .",
    "observations at high spectral resolution ( @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath7 10,000 ) in the uv show that the absorption tends to split into multiple kinematic components with widths in the range 20  500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "detailed studies of the `` intrinsic '' absorbers indicate large global covering factors ( @xmath3 @xmath8 0.5  1.0 ) of the nucleus and mass - loss rates compable to the inferred mass accretion rates ( @xmath00.01 m@xmath9 yr@xmath1 ) ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the origin of the intrinsic absorbers ( e.g. , accretion disk , torus ) and the means by which they are accelerated outward ( e.g. , thermal winds , radiatively - driven flows , hydromagnetic flows ) are currently unknown .",
    "the large global covering factors of the uv absorbers suggest that they should contribute to at least some of the uv and optical emission that we see .",
    "thus , it is only natural to ask if they are associated in some way with either the narrow ( emission ) line region ( nlr ) or the broad ( emission ) line region ( blr ) .",
    "an important clue is that the highest radial velocity observed in any seyfert 1 galaxy is only@xmath22100 km s@xmath1 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is comparable to the maximum velocity ( half - width at zero intensity ) of the nlr gas and much less than that of the blr gas , which extends out to @xmath710000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the available evidence indicates that uv absorbers have transverse velocities comparable to their radial velocities ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2003a , 2004a ) .",
    "thus , the kinematics of the absorbers suggest that they are more closely related to the nlr than the blr .",
    "another clue to the origin of the absorbers and their connection to the emission - line regions is their radial location with respect to the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , but this is a difficult parameter to obtain .",
    "early studies of the ultraviolet spectrum of ngc  4151 with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ found that the uv absorbers must lie outside of the broad ( emission ) line region ( blr ) , since both continuum and broad - line emission were absorbed ( bromage et al .",
    "this was later found to be the case as well for a sample of seyfert 1 galaxies observed by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ) .",
    "various studies have placed upper or lower limits on the distances of outflowing uv or x - ray absorbers from their nuclei , and these fall in the range of tenths to tens of parsecs of the systemic velocity can often , but not always , be attributed to gas at much larger distances in the host galaxy s disk or halo ( weymann et al .",

    "recently , we determined a reliable distance for an outflowing uv absorber ( gabel et al .",
    "2004a ) , which is component `` 1 '' in ngc 3783 , at a radial velocity of @xmath21350 km s@xmath1 with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy . from the relative strengths of the metastable c  iii * @xmath51175 multiplet lines in absorption , we determined that the hydrogen number density of the absorber was @xmath10 @xmath4 4 @xmath11 10@xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "combined with the ionization parameter and ionizing luminosity , this yields a distance of @xmath025 pc from the central continuum source ( gabel et al .",
    "this absorber is therefore in the inner nlr , which typically extends out to several hundred parsecs from the nucleus ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .    given their locations and velocities , are the uv absorbers just nlr clouds seen in absorption ?",
    "global estimates of the covering factor of the nlr in seyfert 1 galaxies yield values of @xmath3 @xmath4 0.02 ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , nlr clouds tend to have a lower ionization parameter ( @xmath14 ) , defined as the ratio of ionizing photons to hydrogen atoms at the ionized face , and higher hydrogen column density ( @xmath15 ) than uv absorbers , on average ( crenshaw et al",
    ". however , previous studies have already shown that a typical nlr is composed of a multi - phase medium ; clouds with different physical conditions ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath10 ) coexist at the same radial locations ( kraemer & crenshaw 2000 , kraemer et al .",
    "one possibility is that uv absorbers are associated with a high - ionization , diffuse component of the nlr , rather than the entire nlr .",
    "this idea is similar to that of cecil et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who suggest that the high - velocity ( extending up to @xmath23200 km s@xmath1 ) emission - line clouds in the nlr of ngc 1068 would resemble the `` associated absorbers '' in quasars if seen against the continuum source .",
    "however , these high - velocity clouds have a covering factor of @xmath3 @xmath16 0.02 . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility that there is a high - ionization component of the nlr with a covering factor that is sufficiently large to account for most of the intrinsic uv absorption in seyfert galaxies .",
    "_ hst _ images of the nlr show that nearly all seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies have a bright central knot of [ o  iii ] emission ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003a ) , and space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) slitless spectra of these nuclear knots show they have high velocity dispersions ( ruiz et al .",
    "their high surface brightnesses , proximity to their nuclei , and high velocity dispersions indicate they are good candidates for uv absorbers seen in emission . in this paper",
    ", we explore a number of their properties based on the stis spectra of ruiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . to demonstrate that the nuclear emission - line knots can be responsible for the uv absorption",
    ", it is necessary to show that their spectra show evidence for a high - ionization , high covering factor component .",
    "we present a stis uv / optical spectrum of the nuclear [ o  iii ] knot in ngc  4151 that is ideal for this purpose (  4 ) .",
    "first , however , we provide new measurements that explore the kinematic and positional similarities between the uv absorbers (  2 ) and the nlr (  3 ) .",
    "observations at high spectral resolution ( @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath17 10,000 ) are needed to resolve the kinematic components of intrinsic absorption in seyfert galaxies .",
    "this requirement is met in the uv ( 1200  3200  ) by observations with the high - resolution modes of _ hst _ s stis or the first - generation goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) , and in the far - uv ( 900  1200  ) with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "we have compiled the available measurements of the radial - velocity centroid ( @xmath18 ) , relative to the host galaxy , and full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the absorption depth for individual absorption components observed by these instruments .",
    "the sample contains 61 absorption components in 10 seyfert 1 galaxies : ngc 3516 ( crenshaw et al . 1999 ; kraemer et al . 2002 ) , ngc 3783 ( kraemer et al . 2001a ; gabel et al . 2003 ) , ngc  5548 ( mathur et al . 1999 ; crenshaw et al . 2003 ) , mrk  509 ( kriss et al . 2000 ; kraemer et al . 2003 ) , ngc  4051 ( collinge et al . 2001 ) , ngc 4151 ( weymann et al . 1997 ; kraemer et al .",

    "although the sample is rather sparse , there is no clear trend ; components at both high and low @xmath19 show a large range in fwhm .",
    "the tendency for most low ( within @xmath20 250 km s@xmath1 ) @xmath18 components to have low ( @xmath21  100 km s@xmath1 ) fwhm reflects the finding that a large fraction arise in the seyfert host galaxies , as has been demonstrated for specific components in ngc 4151 ( weymann et al .",
    "1997 ) , akn 564 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ngc 4395 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "furthermore , a galactic origin may very well explain all of the cases of positive @xmath18 .",
    "however , some of these low @xmath18 components are likely intrinsic to the agn ; for example , a component in ngc  3516 at @xmath18 @xmath8 30 km s@xmath1 has shown strong variability in its column density , indicating that it arises close to the nucleus ( kraemer et al .",
    "2002).15 km s@xmath1 for _ fuse _ , @xmath08 km s@xmath1 for stis ) , so that lines with the lowest fwhm ( 20  30 km s@xmath1 ) are just barely resolved .",
    "some of the absorption lines are likely saturated , so the fwhm may overestimate their intrinsic velocity spread .",
    "the four points with low fwhm at @xmath0 @xmath22100 km s@xmath1 are subcomponents of an absorption feature in ngc  7469 ( kriss et al .",

    "2001a ) . ]    for our purposes , the importance of figure 1 is that it shows the radial velocities of intrinsic uv absorbers are @xmath23 2100 km s@xmath1 in seyfert galaxies , and the majority of components ( 51 out of 61 ) have @xmath24 1000 km s@xmath1 . in a survey of low - resolution uv spectra of seyfert galaxies",
    ", we found a similar result : the highest ( most negative ) radial velocity was @xmath22150 km s@xmath1 , for i  zw  1 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "transverse velocities of the absorbers are more difficult to obtain , but a few lower limits on the order of @xmath01000 km s@xmath1 have been determined by detecting the motion of absorbing clouds across the blr ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2003a , and references therein )",
    ". the only reasonably accurate transverse velocity to date is for `` component 1 '' in ngc  3783 , which lies in the range @xmath25 @xmath8 540  1430 km s@xmath1 ( crenshaw , kraemer , & gabel 2004a ) .",
    "many other absorption components have been monitored on a yearly basis and have not shown evidence for transverse motion , so the transverse velocities could be much lower for these components .",
    "although more work needs to be done , the available evidence indicates that the space velocities of uv absorbers in seyfert galaxies are much less than those of blr clouds , and very similar to the velocities in the nlr .",
    "we require the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ to isolate the nuclear emission - line knots and measure their sizes , and the spectral resolution of stis to accurately measure their kinematics .",
    "stis medium - dispersion spectra of the bright [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 emission line are ideal for this purpose .",
    "we use the stis slitless spectra of ngc 4151 ( hutchings et al .",
    "1998 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ) and nine other seyfert galaxies ( ruiz et al . 2005",
    "; see this paper for details on the observations and data reduction ) , obtained with the g430 m grating and an open aperture .",
    "the spectra have a spatial resolution of 01 ( full - width at half - maximum ) ( fwhm ) and a velocity resolution of 33 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) in the dispersion direction .",
    "ruiz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that nine of the ten seyfert galaxies in their sample show bright , compact ( fwhm @xmath21 05 ) [ o  iii ] knots at their optical continuum peaks with apparently high velocity dispersions .",
    "the only exception is mrk  3 , which shows _ several _ bright knots with high velocity dispersions within @xmath01@xmath26 of its optical nucleus ; we do not use mrk  3 for this study .    for the 10 nuclear emission - line knots , we measured the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 emission in the dispersion ( radial velocity ) and cross - dispersion ( spatial ) directions .",
    "we also measured the half - width at zero intensity ( hwzi ) in the dispersion direction .",
    "we use these parameters rather than the full widths to compare with the uv absorber kinematics , because they are more appropriate for simple geometries . for an expanding shell , for example",
    ", the hwhm of the intensity profile in the spatial direction can be compared to the average absorber distance , and the hwzi in the spectral direction can be compared to the maximum absorber radial velocities . however , we note that direct comparisons can only be made by assuming very specific geometric and kinematic models .",
    "table 1 shows measurements of the nuclear knots in our sample , which includes two seyfert 1 , one seyfert 1.9 , and seven seyfert 2 galaxies at redshifts @xmath21 0.03 .",
    "three of the nuclear knots are only marginally resolved , and we list their hwhm sizes ( in arcsecs and parsecs ) as upper limits . the hwhm s range from 7 to 67 pc , similar to estimates for the distances of uv absorbers from their continuum sources , as described in  1 .",
    "the hwzi s range from 310 to 1060 km s@xmath1 , similar to the range of maximum absorber velocities found in most seyfert galaxies , as described in  2 .",
    "to determine the physical conditions in a nuclear emission - line knot , we would like to have extensive uv and optical coverage to get as many emission - line diagnostics as possible . we also require the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ to isolate the knot . of the sources in table 1 ,",
    "only ngc  4151 has low - dispersion stis spectra covering a large wavelength range ( 1150  10,270  ) .",
    "we searched the multimission archives at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) and found two sets of low - dispersion spectra of the nucleus : one obtained on 1998 january 8/february 10 ( published in nelson et al . 2000 ) and one obtained on 2000 may 24/28 ( previously unpublished ) .",
    "the latter set was obtained when the uv and blr fluxes were in a much lower state ( continuum flux at 1465   @xmath8 2.0 ( @xmath200.3 ) @xmath11 10@xmath27 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath28 @xmath1 ) compared to that of the 1998 observations ( 24.1 ( @xmath200.5 ) @xmath11 10@xmath27 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath28 @xmath1 ) , and is therefore ideal for deconvolving emission lines with both broad and narrow components .",
    "the only drawback in using ngc  4151 is that it has strong intrinsic absorption lines that contaminate the narrow emission - line spectrum in the uv . in particular , absorption due to the host galaxy and/or halo ( components f and f@xmath22 in weymann et al . 1997 )",
    "severely absorb the narrow emission components of the uv resonance lines of l@xmath29 , n  v , o  i , c  ii , si  iv , c  iv , and mg  ii , to the extent that their nlr contributions are not measurable even in stis echelle spectra ( see kraemer et al .",
    "however , when ngc  4151 is in a high state , the unusual ( for seyferts ) balmer absorption lines nearly disappear ( hutchings et al .",
    "thus , we use the high - state slitless spectra of h@xmath30 and h@xmath29 obtained on 1997 july 15 ( previously published in kaiser et al .",

    "2002 ) to deconvolve their narrow and broad emission components .    in table 2",
    ", we list the stis observations that we retrieved from the mast for this analysis .",
    "the first four observations are the low - dispersion , long - slit spectra , which have a resolving power of @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath4 1000 , and the last two are the medium - dispersion , slitless spectra of h@xmath30 ( plus [ o  iii ] @xmath31 4959 , 5007 ) and h@xmath29 ( plus [ n  ii ] @xmath316548 , 6584 ) , with @xmath5/@xmath6 @xmath4 9000 .",
    "we reduced the stis low- and medium - dispersion spectra using the idl software developed at nasa s goddard space flight center for the instrument definition team .",
    "we identified and removed cosmic - ray hits using multiple images and removed hot or warm pixels by interpolation in the dispersion direction .",
    "we used wavelength calibration exposures obtained after each science observation to correct the wavelength scale for zero - point shifts .",
    "for the g750l spectra , we used a contemporaneous continuum - lamp exposure in the flat - fielding process to remove the fringes at the long - wavelength end .",
    "we extracted the spectra from the flux - calibrated ccd images using a bin height of 11 pixels ( 055 ) in the cross - dispersion direction , which corresponds to the full - width at zero - intensity ( fwzi ) of the [ o  iii ] nuclear knot from the g430 m slitless spectrum .",
    "for the flux - calibrated mama images , we used the same extraction height of 055 , which corresponds to 22 pixels on the mama detector .",
    "we combined the low - dispersion spectra in their regions of overlap to obtain a single spectrum from 1150  10,270  .    in figure 2",
    ", we show the full low - dispersion spectrum of the nuclear emission - line knot in ngc  4151 .",
    "narrow emission lines covering a broad range in ionization are present , from [ o  i ] to [ fe  xi ] ; the ionization potential needed to create the latter is ip@xmath32 @xmath8 262 ev .",
    "we see no evidence for even higher ionization lines , like the [ s  xii ] @xmath57611 line ( ip@xmath32 @xmath8 505 ev ) seen in the stis spectrum of the hot spot in ngc  1068 ( kraemer & crenshaw 2000a ) .",
    "the broad components of the permitted lines are clearly evident but still unusually weak for ngc  4151 .",
    "although uv resonance lines are detected in emission , their fluxes are severely affected by the intrinsic absorption lines , as discussed previously .",
    "we measured the fluxes of isolated emission lines by direct integration above local continuum fits . for narrow lines that were blended with other broad or narrow emission",
    ", we used the [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 profile as a template to deconvolve the blends ( see crenshaw & peterson 1986 ) .",
    "we used the medium - dispersion spectra to deconvolve the blend of narrow and broad h@xmath30 and the blend of narrow and broad h@xmath29 and the [ n ii ] lines .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the narrow component of h@xmath30 , which we use as our standard for line ratios , was easily separated from the broad component in this medium - dispersion spectrum .",
    "lines that we deblended in the low - dispersion spectra include the broad and narrow components of the h and he permitted lines and the semi - forbidden lines in the uv , as well as the narrow [ s  ii ] @xmath316716 , 6731 lines and h@xmath33 plus [ o  iii ] @xmath54363 lines .",
    "we determined the reddening of the the narrow emission lines from the he  ii @xmath51640/@xmath54686 ratio , the galactic reddening curve of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) , and an intrinsic he  ii ratio of 7.2 .",
    "we determined uncertainties in the dereddened ratios from the sum in quadrature of the errors from three sources : photon noise , different reasonable continuum placements , and reddening .",
    "table 3 gives the observed and dereddened narrow - line ratios , relative to h@xmath30 , as well as the uncertainties in these ratios .",
    "the reddening determined from the he  ii ratio is only e(b@xmath2v ) @xmath8 0.02 @xmath20 0.04 .",
    "the reddening correction has a very small effect on our line ratios , as shown in table 3 , and uncertainties in the correction have a negligible effect on our results .",
    "the reddening that we have determined can be attributed entirely to reddening in our galaxy , which is e(b@xmath2v ) @xmath8 0.03 ( schlegel et al .",
    "thus , there is no evidence for dust in the inner nlr of ngc 4151 , although at other locations in the nlr , the observed reddening of the emission lines ranges from e(b@xmath2v ) @xmath8 0.01 to 0.36 ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001b ) .      to explore the physical conditions and covering factor of the nuclear knot in ngc  4151 , we generated photoionization models using the code cloudy ( ferland et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we modeled the emission - line gas as single - zoned slabs , directly irradiated by the central source .",
    "we used the same spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the ionizing continuum radiation as we used previously for ngc  4151 ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001b ) , which consist of broken power - laws of the form @xmath34 , where the spectral index @xmath35 for h@xmath36 @xmath21 13.6 ev , @xmath37 over the range 13.6 ev @xmath16 h@xmath36 @xmath21 1 kev , and @xmath38 above 1 kev , and the luminosity in ionizing photons is 2 x 10@xmath39 s@xmath1 .",
    "we assumed roughly solar elemental abundances ( e.g. grevesse & anders 1989 ) and that the gas was free of cosmic dust .",
    "the models are parameterized in terms of the ionization parameter ( @xmath14 ) , the hydrogen number density ( @xmath10 ) , and the hydrogen column density ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the emission - lines in table 3 span a huge range in ionization and critical density , and it is clear that multiple model components are required .",
    "since the nuclear knot is resolved , we used the radius inside of which one - half of the knot s [ o  iii ] emission is contained as a starting point for the distances of the components .",
    "this radius is 015 , which corresponds to a projected distance of 9.5 pc from the central continuum source .",
    "the dereddened he  ii @xmath54686/h@xmath30 ratio in table 3 is relatively high for photoionized gas , which suggests either 1 ) a much harder continuum sed than we have used , or 2 ) a strong contribution from a high - ionization , matter - bound ( optically thin to hydrogen - ionizing radiation ) component .",
    "there is no evidence for a much harder sed and , in fact , we have used the above sed to successfully model the emission - line ratios from other parts of the nlr in ngc  4151 ( kraemer et al .",
    "furthermore , any sed that possesses a realistic euv bump would boost both the he ii and [ ne v ] emission , but what is required is a high [ ne  v]/he  ii ratio ( table 3 ) .",
    "this can only be achieved with an optically thin component that has a large ne@xmath40 zone prior to the point where the gas becomes optically thick to the he  ii ionizing radiation ( kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we have therefore adopted a matter - bound component ( `` uvabs '' ) with parameters typical of most uv absorbers ( crenshaw et al .",

    "the predicted ionic column densities listed in the footnotes to table 3 would result in absorption lines that are typical of most uv absorbers : strong - to - saturated ly@xmath29 , c  iv @xmath31 1548.2 , 1550.8 , n  v @xmath31 1238.8 , 1242.8 , and o  vi @xmath311031.9 , 1036.3 , and weak or undetectable si  iv @xmath311393.8 , 1402.8 .    in order to fit the observed emission - line ratios , we required two additional components : a moderate density , radiation - bound component ( `` oiii '' ) to reproduce the strong [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 emission , and a higher density , radiation - bound component ( `` dense '' ) to account for the strong [ o  iii ] @xmath54363 line ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we were unable to find a satisfactory single - component solution , since , for example , the [ ne  iv ] @xmath5 2423 line is quenched at intermediate densities .",
    "the oiii component was kept at a distance of 9.5 pc , consistent with measurements of the [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 emission .",
    "we kept the same ionization parameter ( @xmath45 0.01 ) for the dense component , but increased its density , which effectively moves it to a distance of 2.0 pc from the continuum source . to produce a composite model spectrum , we adjusted the weight of each component according to the fraction of h@xmath30 it contributes until we obtained a good match with the dereddened line ratios .",
    "we give the component and composite line ratios in table 3 , along with the final model parameters , the weight of each component , and the flux of h@xmath30 at the ionized face of each component ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "nearly all of the dereddened line ratios are fit well by the composite model .",
    "the low critical density lines ( see osterbrock 1989 ) from low ionization species such as [ o  ii ] @xmath53227 and [ s  ii ] @xmath31 6716 , 6731 are underpredicted , which could be rectified by introducing an additional component outside the emission - line bicone that is irradiated by a heavily absorbed continuum , similar to the model described for the hot spot in ngc 1068 ( kraemer & crenshaw 2000a ) . also , the model significantly underpredicts the strengths of the [ fe  vii ] and [ fe  xi ] lines , but this is a common problem in nlr models ( oliva 1997 ) that may be due to problems with the atomic data ( s.b .",

    "hence , this component , which , of course would contribute less if the temperature were higher , can not contribute significantly to the observed he ii emission .",
    "] even with the inclusion of uvabs , our model underpredicts the [ ne  v]/h@xmath30 ratio somewhat .",
    "this can not be corrected with a harder sed because it would lead to an overprediction of he  ii / h@xmath30 , as discussed earlier in this section .",
    "one plausible explanation is that the ionizing continuum has been modified by optically thin gas closer to the nucleus , which has absorbed some of the radiation near the he  ii lyman limit but has no effect at energies @xmath17 97 ev ( the ionization potential of ne@xmath49 ) .",
    "the result would be that the [ ne  v ] would be enhanced with respect to he  ii , as demonstrated in kraemer et al .",

    "the extinction - corrected h@xmath30 luminosity of the central knot is 6.4 x 10@xmath50 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "based on the relative contribution to h@xmath30 from each model and the emitted flux of h@xmath30 at the ionized face ( table 3 ) , we derive the following covering fractions : for uvabs , @xmath3 @xmath8 1.1 ; for oiii , @xmath3 @xmath8 0.02 ; and for dense , @xmath51 @xmath8 0.03 .",
    "the global covering factor of the uvabs component is close to one , which , given our assumptions , is consistent with the derived value of @xmath3 @xmath8 0.5  1.0 for intrinsic uv absorption in seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw et al .",

    "2001b ) shows evidence for partial covering in the line - of sight , which indicates partial global covering .",
    "however , this component is much closer to the source and has a much higher column density than uvabs ; there are other uv absorption components in ngc  4151 that may fully cover the continuum source . ]",
    "we conclude that there is strong evidence for a high - ionization , matter - bound component in the nuclear knot of ngc  4151 with a high global covering factor .",
    "we have shown that the bright central knots of emission in the nlrs of most seyfert galaxies are likely sources of intrinsic absorption lines that we detect in their uv spectra , particularly absorbers that are outflowing with radial velocities @xmath52 km s@xmath1 .",
    "our evidence is based on the similarities in the kinematics and locations of the nlr knots and the uv absorbers .",
    "more work must be done to test these connections . in particular , more information is needed on the distances of the uv absorbers from their central continuum sources , based on monitoring campaigns and/or detection of metastable lines ( see crenshaw et al .",
    "we note that intrinsic absorption lines that are within a few hundred km s@xmath1 of the systemic velocity can arise from either the agn or host galaxy ; the percentage from each is not known and deserves further study .    to establish a more direct link between the emission and absorption , we modeled the narrow emission lines from the resolved central knot in ngc  4151 .",
    "we found that the line ratios indicate a high - ionization , matter - bound component in the nuclear emission - line knot .",
    "our characterization of this component in the form of `` uvabs '' yields a high global covering factor , which matches that found for intrinsic uv absorption in seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "given the physical conditions of uvabs , it would be detected as a typical uv absorber if seen projected against the continuum source and blr .",
    "we note that the observed uv spectrum of ngc  4151 shows components of absorption that span a wide range in ionization and column density ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001b ) , but not a component that specifically matches our uvabs model component for the central emission - line knot .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that we are viewing the agn at a special angle , close to the edge of the emission - line bicone ( crenshaw et al . 2000 ) , which may explain its complex absorption spectrum ( kraemer et al .",
    "the uvabs component could be `` hidden '' in the complex of absorption , specifically in the broad component `` d+e '' , or just not present in the line of sight due to a variation in absorption properties with polar angle ( with respect to the accretion and/or torus axes ) .",
    "nevertheless , an important follow - up study would be to model the emission - line spectra of central knots in other seyfert galaxies , and compare these with their absorption - line properties to test the generality of our results .",
    "a number of dynamical models invoke accretion - disk winds to explain the intrinsic absorption ( and broad - line emission ) in agn , using radiation pressure ( murray et al .",
    "1985 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ) and/or centrifugal acceleration along magnetic field lines ( blandford & payne 1982 ; bottorff et al .",
    "the absorbers in these models are located close to the blr , which is only light - days from the central continuum source ( presumably the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole ) . however , our results suggest that a large fraction , and perhaps a majority , of uv absorbers are located in the inner nlrs of seyfert galaxies , at distances of tens of parsecs from their central continuum sources , and are therefore not directly associated with accretion - disk winds .",
    "this does not rule out an origin in the accretion disk , but other origins for the outflowing gas , such as the torus ( krolik & kriss 1995 ) are also possible .",
    "once again , ngc  4151 appears to be an exceptional case , presumably as a result of our special viewing angle .",
    "the broad component `` d+e '' is at a distance of only @xmath00.03 pc from the continuum source ( kraemer et al .",
    "2001b ) , and may be the best candidate for an accretion - disk wind in a seyfert galaxy .",
    "there are also outflowing absorbers at large distances from the nucleus ( @xmath0700 and @xmath02100 pc ) in ngc  4151 , which may be associated with emission - line clouds further out in the nlr or in the extended nlr ( enlr ) .",
    "some of the absorbers in other seyfert galaxies may also arise in these more distant regions .",
    "finally , we note that x - ray absorbers , which tend to have higher column densities than uv absorbers and likely dominate the mass outflow rates , may also be associated with the nlr .",
    "spectra at the highest possible resolutions with _ hst_/stis and the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( _ cxo _ ) indicate that the uv and x - ray absorption in individual seyfert galaxies cover very similar ranges in radial velocity ( crenshaw et al . 2003a , and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests that the uv and x - ray absorbers may be spatially colocated ; for example the uv absorbers could be high - density knots in an x - ray wind ( krolik & kriss 1995 , 2001 ) . also , _",
    "cxo _ observations of ngc  4151 and ngc  1068 ( ogle et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) show extended x - ray emission - line regions that are colocated with their nlrs , which would likely be seen as x - ray absorbers if projected against the continuum source .",
    "further identification of components in both emission and absorption should lead to much tighter constraints on the physical conditions , geometry , and dynamics of the outflowing gas .",
