    "the earth s lower mantle is the largest . located 6602890 km deep , this region of the earth interior has a wide pressure ( @xmath11 ) and temperature ( @xmath12 ) range , spanning over 23135 gpa and 19004000 k , respectively .",
    "the lower mantle is dominated by iron - bearing minerals : @xmath13 vol% of ferropericlase ( fp ) [ ( mg , fe)o ] , @xmath14 vol% of fe - bearing magnesium silicate ( mgsio@xmath1 ) perovskite ( fe - pv ) , and a relatively thin layer of fe - bearing mgsio@xmath1 post - perovskite ( fe - ppv ) located in its bottom ( d \" layer ) .",
    "ever since the observation of spin crossover in fp and fe - pv @xcite , the work on these minerals has risen to a new high , especially for fp , due to its simple rock - salt structure .",
    "it is believed that fe@xmath2 in fp undergoes a crossover from the high - spin ( hs ) state ( @xmath15 ) to the low - spin ( ls ) state ( @xmath16 ) between 4070 gpa .",
    "this spin crossover directly affects the structural , elastic , thermodynamic , optical , and conducting properties of fp @xcite ; it also affects iron diffusion and thus perhaps viscosity and iron partitioning in the earth interior @xcite .",
    "based on these findings , geophysical effects of spin crossover have been anticipated .",
    "in contrast , spin crossover in fe - pv , the _ major _ lower - mantle mineral phase , has been highly controversial @xcite , due to the complex nature of this mineral .",
    "in addition to fe@xmath2 that substitutes mg in the dodecahedral ( @xmath17 ) site forming ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv , there is also ferric iron ( fe@xmath18 ) substituting both mg and si [ residing the octahedral ( @xmath19 ) site ] , forming ( mg , fe)(si , fe)o@xmath1 pv . with the recent findings made by first - principle calculations @xcite , a consensus has gradually been reached : only fe@xmath18 residing in the @xmath19 site undergoes a crossover from hs ( @xmath20 ) to ls ( @xmath21 ) state ; iron in the @xmath17 site remains in hs state , regardless of its oxidation state .",
    "the geophysical consequences of spin crossover are still unclear , but its possible effects on mineral properties have been reviewed or summarized in literatures @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was found that fe - pv dissociates into fe - free pv and a hexagonal iron - rich silicate at conditions existing approximately at 2,000 km depth and beyond @xcite . the crystal structure and stability field of this hexagonal phase , however , have not been characterized yet .",
    "therefore , it is important to properly characterize the state of iron at lower mantle conditions , so the dissociation phase boundary in fe - pv can be better clarified .",
    "while the spin crossovers in fp and fe - pv are nearly understood , one issue still remains unresolved . as a @xmath22 ion , an intermediate - spin ( is ) state with @xmath3 is possible for fe@xmath2 .",

    "however , both the currently perceived hs - ls crossover or a more complicated hs - is - ls crossover can lead to decreasing @xmath23 . also , while the change of iron nuclear quadrupole splitting ( qs ) observed in mssbauer spectra @xcite indicates a change of @xmath7-electron configuration , it is insufficient to exclude or confirm an is state .",
    "recently , the existence of is fe@xmath2 in fp was investigated , but its possible role in spin crossover was not addressed @xcite .",
    "as for ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv , is fe@xmath2 has been highly debated .",
    "an observed crossover from a lower qs ( @xmath24 mm / s ) to a higher qs ( @xmath25 mm / s ) was suggested to be indicative of an hs - is crossover , as the high qs was suggested to be a signature of is fe@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "previous first - principles calculations , however , showed that two distinct types of hs states with distinct qss and one is state are possible ; it is the crossover between two hs states leading to the drastic change of qs , from 2.4 to 3.5 mm / s @xcite .",
    "the one is state , on the other hand , is energetically unfavorable ; its qs obtained by calculation ( @xmath26 mm / s ) was not observed in experiments either @xcite .",
    "so far , is fe@xmath2 in fe - pv is still puzzling .",
    "one reason is the lack of a thorough knowledge for the is fe@xmath2 reported in ref .  ; the other is the possibility of multiple types of is fe@xmath2 .",
    "after all , fe - pv is known to have two distinct types of hs fe@xmath2 ; it may have multiple types of is fe@xmath2 as well .",
    "recently , an anomalous conductivity change in fe - pv with increasing pressure was observed , and it was attributed to a possible hs - is crossover of fe@xmath2 @xcite . given that the mechanism of spin crossover is usually deduced from anomalous change in mineral properties _ indirectly _ related to iron spin state , a comprehensive theoretical study for is fe@xmath2 in fp and pv is highly desirable to clear this long - standing debate .",
    "in addition to geophysics , is state in fe@xmath2 and other @xmath22 ions are of broad interest .",

    "a possible connection between is fe@xmath2 and superconductivity in iron - based superconductors has been discussed but is still unclear @xcite .",
    "is fe@xmath2 would add versatility to the range of possibility of molecular devices based on coordination complexes / compunds @xcite , but its existence is still controversial ( see e.g. ref .  ) and conditions for its existence seem to be limited @xcite .",
    "last , but not least , the strain - induced ferromagnetic insulating state in lanthanum cobaltite ( lacoo@xmath1 ) thin film and its possible relation with is co@xmath18 has attracted significant attention and is still being debated @xcite .",

    "in this work , all major calculations are performed using the local density approximation + self - consistent hubbard @xmath5 ( lda+@xmath27 ) method , as lda+@xmath27 gives the most accurate equation of states for iron - bearing earth minerals and best predicts the occurence and mechanism of spin crossover in them , compared with other functionals @xcite .",

    "therefore , the qs of this state is quite low , about 0.91.6 mm / s ( depending on pressure ) , slightly higher than the qs of ls fe@xmath2 in pv , 0.8 mm / s @xcite .",
    "the pdos of is(@xmath98 ) state is shown in fig .",
    "[ pv_ferrous_is_electronic](h ) .",
    "the ildos of each peak ( i - m ) resulting from iron @xmath66 electrons are shown in figs .",
    "[ pv_ferrous_is_electronic](i)-[pv_ferrous_is_electronic](m ) , respectively .",
    "the lowest three orbitals ( i , j , and k ) exhibit @xmath51 characters : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the filled @xmath53-like orbital is @xmath112 , consistent with the longer average fe  o distances on the @xmath113 plane [ fig .",
    "[ pv_ferrous_is_atomic](d ) ] .",
    "this state has a hole in the @xmath102 orbital ; it resembles the is(@xmath56 ) state in fp .",
    "as expected , it has quite low qs , 0.81.4 mm / s ( depending on pressure ) , which is in between the qss of the ls and is(@xmath57 ) state in pv .    to determine whether is fe@xmath2 in pv is possible at all , we compute the enthalpy of all possible spin states , including the two hs states with distinct qss ( referred to as low - qs and high - qs hs states ) reported in refs .   and , the two is states , and one ls state .",
    "the relative enthalpy of these states with respect to the high - qs hs state , along with the computed qss , are shown in fig .",
    "[ dh_vs_p_all_pv_prb ] ( qss of hs states are adopted from ref .  ) .",
    "the @xmath27 of the hs and ls fe@xmath2 are 3.1 and 4.5 ev , respectively , nearly the same as those reported in ref .  , which extracts @xmath5 from the dft ground states .",
    "the reason is that for ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv with low iron concentration , standard dft functionals can give correct insulating state and orbital occupancy for the hs and ls states ; extracting @xmath5 from dft or dft+@xmath5 ground states should thus give similar results .",
    "also , the @xmath27 of fe@xmath2 in pv barely depends on supercell volume and can be treated as a constant with respect to volume .",
    "evident from fig .",
    "[ dh_vs_p_all_pv_prb ] , the two is states are energetically competitive . in 032 gpa",
    ", the is(@xmath98 ) state has lower enthalpy ; in 32150 gpa , which covers most of the lower - mantle pressure range , the is(@xmath97 ) has lower enthalpy , making it the most probable is state in the lower mantle .",
    "the reason why these two is states have similar physical properties ( qs , @xmath27 , and enthalpy ) is that the is(@xmath97 ) state in pv has its @xmath51 hole in the @xmath114 orbital , closely oriented with the @xmath115 orbital , instead of in the @xmath116 orbital .",
    "hypothetically , if the @xmath51-like hole of the is(@xmath97 ) state in pv were opened in the @xmath116 orbital like the is(@xmath57 ) state in fp , the on - site coulomb interaction would be stronger , the self - consistent hubbard @xmath27 would be larger , the total energy would be significantly higher , and the qs would be exceptionally large . to reduce the energy , both is states in ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv have closely oriented hole - electron combination , similar to the is(@xmath56 ) state in fp .",
    "regardless , these two is states are still not favorable .",
    "the only crossover in this system occurs between low - qs to high - qs hs state at 20 gpa , similar to the previous calculation @xcite .    as shown above , is fe@xmath2 in ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv resides in a distorted octahedral crystal field , with orbitals exhibiting @xmath51 and @xmath53 characters .",
    "with one @xmath53-like orbital being filled , the @xmath51-like hole is uniquely determined as well : it should be opened in the most closely oriented orbital to reduce the total energy .",
    "given that there are only two @xmath53-like orbitals , the two is states reported here should include all possible is fe@xmath2 in pv .",
    "the signature of is fe@xmath2 in pv in the lower - mantle pressure range should be a qs in between 0.8 and 1.6 mm / s . given the lack of such qs observed in mssbauer spectra and the high enthalpy of is state , the observed qs ( 3.5 mm / s @xcite ) should be indeed a hs state , and is fe@xmath2 in pv would be highly unlikely .    while a similar investigation for fe - ppv is not conducted here , an is fe@xmath2 in ppv has been reported in ref .  , and it is similar to the is(@xmath97 ) state in pv . given the highly similar crystal fields experienced by fe@xmath2 in pv and ppv , this reported is state in ppv should be the most probable is state in the d \" pressure range , if not only .",
    "nevertheless , this is state is still unfavorable , and its qs is inconsistent with experiments either , as detailed in ref .  .",
    "therefore , is fe@xmath2 in ppv should also be highly unlikely .",
    "using lda+@xmath27 calculations , we have investigated in details the possible stability of the controversial intermediate - spin state of fe@xmath2 in lower - mantle minerals subject to pressure - induced spin crossover : ferropericlase [ ( mg@xmath28,fe@xmath29)o ] ( @xmath30 ) and ( mg@xmath28,fe@xmath29)sio@xmath1 perovskite ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "two types of is states with distinct @xmath66 hole - electron combinations were found in fp : the is(@xmath56 ) state and the is(@xmath57 ) state , with a @xmath54 and @xmath55 electron , respectively , and a @xmath52 hole .",
    "these distinct orbital occupancies lead to distinct jahn - teller distortions and iron nuclear quadrupole splittings : the is(@xmath57 ) state has an exceptionally high qs ( @xmath117 mm / s ) , and the is(@xmath56 ) state has a quite low qs ( @xmath118 mm / s ) .",
    "the on - site coulomb interaction and the total energy of the is(@xmath56 ) state are both lower than that of the is(@xmath57 ) state because of its closely oriented hole - electron combination , namely , less overlap between the spin - up @xmath53 and spin - down @xmath51 electrons . in ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv , although is fe@xmath2 resides in the large dodecahedral site , it effectively experiences a distorted octahedral crystal field .",
    "two types of is states are found , and they can also be characterized by their filled @xmath53-like orbitals . the hole - electron combination of these two is states are both closely oriented ; they both exhibit characters similar to the is(@xmath56 ) state in fp .",
    "therefore , these two is fe@xmath2 in pv have similarly low qs ( @xmath119 mm / s ) and the same hubbard @xmath27 , and they are energetically competitive . compared to",
    "the hs and ls states , all the above - mentioned is states in fp and ( mg , fe)sio@xmath1 pv / ppv are energetically unfavorable ; their qss are also all inconsistent with experiments .",
    "most importantly , these considered is fe@xmath2 already include all relevant types of is fe@xmath2 in lower - mantle minerals .",
    "therefore , it is highly unlikely that is fe@xmath2 exists in the lower mantle .    finally , although this present work is mainly focused on lower - mantle minerals under pressure ( variable metal - oxygen distance ) , it is an exemplar of the behavior of other strongly correlated @xmath22 ions in two common crystalline sites of complex oxides : the octahedral ( @xmath19 ) site in abo@xmath1 perovskite and in the rocksalt structure , and the dodecohedral ( @xmath17 ) site in perovskites .",
    "present results and conclusions could be applicable to or serve as a starting point of investigation for several equivalent problems where the roles played by chemical variation or thermal expansion / contraction can be seen as analogous to pressure , as with spin excitation in rare - earth cobaltites at finite ( but low ) temperatures .    *",
