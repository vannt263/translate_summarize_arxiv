    "the shorter the pump - pulse duration , the smaller the overlap , and the lower values of visibility that result .",

    "( 37 ) for the amplitude @xmath139 , pump - pulse chirp ( characterized by @xmath102 ) introduces a phase modulation of the two - photon amplitude in the @xmath133-direction .",
    "this modulation decreases the overall overlap of the corresponding two - photon amplitudes , given as a sum of the overlaps of their real and imaginary parts . increasing values of the chirp parameter @xmath102",

    "( 19 ) ] of the pump pulse according to the relation @xmath143 $ ] .",
    "thus , more generally , it is the bandwidth of the pump pulse that determines the interference pattern . as a consequence , dispersion of the pump beam between the pump - pulse source and the nonlinear crystal",
    "does not influence the interference pattern .",
    "examination of eqs .",
    "( b3 ) and ( b4 ) in appendix b shows that the dip remains symmetric since the function @xmath144 in eq .",
    "( b3 ) is an odd function of @xmath145 for an arbitrary pump - pulse profile .",
    "frequency filters inserted into the down - converted beams serve to broaden the two - photon amplitude @xmath136 both in the @xmath133- and @xmath125-direction .",
    "broadening in the @xmath125-direction leads to wider dips , whereas that in the @xmath133-direction smooths out the effect of tilt discussed above and thereby results in a higher visibility .",
    "the narrower the spectrum of frequency filters , the wider the dip , and the higher the observed visibility .",
    "the effect of chirp is suppressed by the presence of frequency filters , because they effectively make the complex pump - pulse spectrum narrower and hence diminish relative phase changes across such a narrowed complex spectrum .",
    "second - order dispersion in the _ pump beam _ causes changes in the pulse phase ( chirp ) as the pulse propagates and this leads to broadening of the pulse .",
    "the effect of such pump - pulse broadening is transferred to the down - converted beams , as is clearly shown by the behavior of the two - photon amplitude @xmath136 illustrated in fig .",
    "3 .    in this figure",
    ", the amplitude in the region near @xmath122 s has its origin near the output plane of the crystal where the pump pulse is already broadened as a result of its having propagated through the dispersive crystal . at the other edge , near @xmath146 s the down - converted light arises from the beginning of the crystal where the pump pulse has not yet suffered dispersive broadening .",
    "the profile of the interference dip is modified as follows : an increase in the second - order dispersion parameter @xmath147 leads to an increase of visibility , but no change in the width of the dip , as illustrated in fig.4(a ) . for appropriately chosen values of @xmath147",
    "a small local peak emerges at the bottom of the dip [ see fig.4(a ) ] .",
    "nonzero initial chirp ( @xmath102 ) of the pump beam can provide a higher central peak but on the other hand it reduces the visibility [ see fig.4(b ) ] .",
    "the peak remains , but is suppressed , in the presence of narrow frequency filters .",
    "now we turn to second - order dispersion in the _ down - converted beams _ ( nonzero @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) , which broadens the two - photon amplitude @xmath136 in the @xmath125- , as well as in the @xmath150-direction . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "5 , this leads to a broadening of the dip , as well as asymmetry and oscillations at its borders .",
    "when values of @xmath148 increase , visibility decreases at first and then later increases .",
    "nonzero chirp leads to a lower visibility , but tends to suppress ocillations at the borders of the dip .",
    "frequency filters , which behave as discussed above , suppress asymmetry .    when second - order dispersion occurs in all three modes , the two - photon amplitude @xmath136 is broadened for smaller values of @xmath125 ( mainly owing to dispersion in the pump beam ) as well as for greater values of @xmath125 ( mainly owing to dispersion in the down - converted beams ) . as a result ,",
    "the interference pattern comprises all of the features discussed above : a local peak may emerge at the bottom of the dip , the dip is broadened and asymmetric , and there occur oscillations at the borders of the dip .    to observe the above mentioned effects caused by dispersion in a nonlinear crystal , relatively large values of the dispersion parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149",
    "are required . for example",
    ", our simulations make use of parameter values that are approximately an order of magnitude higher than those of the bbo crystals commonly used in type - ii down - conversion - based interferometric experiments .",
    "second - order dispersion in an optical material ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 ) through which down - converted photons propagate leads to asymmetry of the dip .",
    "the dip is particularly stretched to larger values of @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) as a consequence of the deformation and lengthtening of the two - photon amplitude @xmath153 in a dispersive material .",
    "the higher the difference @xmath154 of the dispersion parameters , the higher the asymmetry and the wider the dip ; moreover its minimum is shifted further to smaller values of @xmath17 ( see fig .  6 ) .",
    "asymmetry of the dip is also preserved when relatively narrow frequency filters are used though the narrowest filters remove it .",
    "chirp decreases visibility but the shape of the dip remains unchanged .",
    "asymmetry of the dip caused by second - order dispersion in an optical material through which down - converted photons propagate can be suppressed in two cases . in the first case , for a pump pulse of arbitrary duration ,",
    "dispersion cancellation occurs when the magnitude of second - order dispersion in the path of the first photon ( given by @xmath155 ) equals that of the second photon ( given by @xmath156 ) .",
    "this observation immediately follows from eqs.(25 ) and ( 26 ) , in which the effect of second - order dispersion is prescribed by the parameter @xmath157 .",
    "dispersion cancellation is a result of completely destructive interference between the amplitudes @xmath136 and @xmath158 for which there is nonzero overlap .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .  7 for @xmath159 mm , i.e. for which @xmath160 .",
    "when the pulse duration is sufficiently long ( in the cw regime ) dispersion cancellation occurs for arbitrary magnitudes of second - order dispersion ( given by @xmath155 and @xmath156 ) present in the paths of the down - converted photons . the gradual suppression of the asymmetry of the dip as the pump pulse duration increases is shown in fig .",
    "dispersion cancellation has its origin in the entanglement of the photons , i.e. , in the fact that the permitted values of the frequency @xmath161 and the frequency @xmath162 are governed by the relation @xmath163 , where @xmath164 lies within the pump - pulse spectrum .",
    "we have developed a description of two - photon type - ii spontaneous parametric down - conversion produced when ultrashort pulses from a femtosecond laser are used to pump an appropriate nonlinear medium , as well as the associated two - photon interference effects .",
    "the model includes frequency modulation of the pump pulse ( chirp ) and dispersion in both the nonlinear crystal and the interferometer s optical elements .",
    "the influence of these features on the depth and asymmetry characteristics of a photon - coincidence interference dip have been established .",
    "we showed that the interference pattern is determined by the bandwidth of the pump pulse ; the larger the bandwidth , the lower the interference - pattern visibility .",
    "this implies that dispersion of the pump beam before the nonlinear crystal does not influence the interference pattern .",
    "second - order dispersion of the pump beam in the nonlinear crystal can result in the occurrence of a local peak at the bottom of the interference dip .",
    "second - order dispersion of the down - converted photons in the crystal can result in oscillations at the borders of the dip , whereas dispersion of the down - coverted photons in the interferometer s optical materials ( e.g. , the delay line ) can produce an asymmetry in the dip . these effects can be used to measure the dispersion parameters of both a nonlinear crystal and an arbitrary optical material .",
