    "tmds @xcite open a new way to a more complete understanding of the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "indeed , some experimental observations can hardly be explained without a more accurate and realistic 3d picture of the nucleon , which naturally includes transverse motion .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry in the distribution of hadrons produced in deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , known as the cahn effect @xcite , is a classical example .",
    "the intrinsic ( transversal ) parton motion is also crucial for the explanation of some spin effects @xcite .    in previous studies we discussed the covariant parton model , which is based on the 3d picture of parton momenta with rotational symmetry in the nucleon rest frame @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this approach is the implication of relations among various pdfs , such as the wandzura - wilczek approximation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 which was proven in @xcite together with some other sum rules . assuming @xmath6 symmetry ( in addition to lorentz invariance and rotational symmetry ) relations between the polarized and unpolarized structure functions were found @xcite , which agree very well with data . in @xcite transversity",
    "was studied in the framework of this model and a relation between transversity @xmath7 and helicity @xmath1 was obtained . in a next step",
    "we generalized the model to the description of tmds .",
    "we derived a relation between the pretzelosity distribution @xmath8 , transversity and helicity @xcite .",
    "finally , with the same model we studied all time - reversal even ( t - even ) tmds and derived a set of relations among them @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was also shown that the 3d picture of parton momenta inside the nucleon provides a basis for a consistent description of quark orbital angular momentum @xcite , which is related to pretzelosity @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that some of the relations among different tmds were found ( sometimes before ) also in other models @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the obtained relations and predictions with experimental data is very important and interesting from phenomenological point of view .",
    "it allows us to judge to which extent the experimental observation can be interpreted in terms of simplified , intuitive notions . the obtained picture of the nucleon can be a useful supplement to the exact but more complicated theory of the nucleon structure based on qcd .",
    "for example , the covariant parton model can be a useful tool for separating effects of qcd from effects of relativistic kinematics .    in this paper we further develop and broadly extend our studies @xcite of the relations between tmds and pdfs .",
    "the formulation of the model in terms of the light - cone formalism @xcite allows us to compute the leading - twist tmds by means of the light - front correlators @xmath9 @xcite as:@xmath10 & = & f_{1}^q(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t})-\\frac{\\varepsilon ^{jk}p_{t}^{j}s_{t}^{k}}{m}% \\,f_{1t}^{\\perp a}(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t } ) ,   \\label{e1}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ \\gamma ^{+}\\gamma _ { 5}\\phi ( x,\\mathbf{p}_{t})\\right ]   & = & s_{l}g_{1}^q(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t})+\\frac{\\mathbf{p}_{t}\\mathbf{s}_{t}}{m}% g_{1t}^{\\bot a}(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t } ) ,   \\label{e2}\\\\ \\hspace{-8 mm } \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ i\\sigma ^{j+}\\gamma _ { 5}\\phi ( x,\\mathbf{p}_{t})\\right ]    & = & s_{t}^{j}\\,h_{1}^q(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t } ) + s_{l}\\,\\frac{p_{t}^{j}}{m}\\,h_{1l}^{\\perp a}(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t } )   \\label{ee2 }   + \\frac{(p_{t}^{j}p_{t}^{k}-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathbf{p}_{t}^{2 }   \\delta^{jk})s_{t}^{k}}{m^{2}}\\,h_{1t}^{\\perp a}(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t } ) + \\frac{\\varepsilon^{jk}p_{t}^{k}}{m}\\,h_{1}^{\\perp a}(x,\\mathbf{p}_{t}).\\;\\;\\end{aligned}\\]]the main goal of this work is to derive relations between these tmds and the usual pdfs @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "similar tasks were recently addressed also in other approaches @xcite .",
    "the section  [ app-1:unpolarized - tmds ] is devoted to the case of the unpolarized tmd , and in section  [ app-2:polarized - tmds ] we discuss polarized tmds .",
    "we use the obtained relations to calculate and discuss the numerical predictions for tmds .",
    "the section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to our concluding remarks .",
    "the distribution @xmath13 is given in the covariant parton model approach by the expression @xcite @xmath14 in the final step of ( [ eq : app - f1 - 1 ] ) we performed the @xmath15-integration by rewriting the @xmath16-function as @xmath17the remarkable feature of the present parton model approach is that one can predict unambiguously the @xmath2- and @xmath18-dependence of tmds from the @xmath2-dependence of the corresponding ( integrated ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the deeper reason for that is the equal ( 3d - symmetric in the nucleon rest frame ) description of longitudinal ( i.e. @xmath15-dependence ) and transverse ( @xmath19-dependence ) parton momenta .",
    "let us remark , that the invariant parameter @xmath2 ( bjorken @xmath2 ) is tightly connected to both longitudinal and transverse parton through the @xmath16-function . in the nucleon rest frame transverse momenta play for @xmath2 an important role according to ( [ eq : identity - delta ] ) .",
    "the 3d momentum distribution @xmath20 was expressed in terms of @xmath0 in previous works @xcite . in order to make this",
    "work self - contained we present here an independent derivation .",
    "we start from the model expression for @xmath21 which follows from the first equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - f1 - 1 ] ) . for the remainder of this section we set the parton mass @xmath22 .",
    "besides being a reasonable approximation , this step greatly simplifies the calculation though finite @xmath23-effect can be included @xcite .",
    "notice that if @xmath23 is neglected then @xmath24 . now , instead of integrating over @xmath15 as we did in eq .",
    "( [ eq : app - f1 - 1 ] ) , it is convenient to use spherical coordinates , and define the angles such that @xmath25 , i.e.   @xmath26the @xmath27-function emerges because the integral over the @xmath28-function obviously yields a non - zero result only if @xmath29 , and implies a lower limit for @xmath30-integral .",
    "notice that there is also an upper limit , namely @xmath31 , related to the fact that @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this upper limit is natural in the covariant parton model in the nucleon rest frame because an on - shell parton can carry at most the momentum @xmath33 which must be compensated by all other partons going in the opposite direction , such that the center of mass of the nucleon remains at rest . since this is an unlikely constellation the momentum distribution @xmath34 vanishes as @xmath35 similarly as @xmath21 drops to zero with @xmath36 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath37and we reproduce the identity @xcite @xmath38 = -\\pi m^{3}\\;g^{q}\\left ( \\frac{xm}{2}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : f1-diff - gp}\\]]this result inserted in ( [ eq : app - f1 - 1 ] ) enables us to predict uniquely @xmath13 from @xmath21 as follows @xmath39 _ { y=\\xi ( x,\\mathbf{p}% _ { t}^{2 } ) } \\label{eq : f1-pt - predicted}\\ ] ] with the dependence on @xmath2 , @xmath3 given through the variable    @xmath40    the variable @xmath41 , first suggested in @xcite , relates the ( very different ! ) dependencies on longitudinal and transverse momenta so that the factorization of these dependencies can be only approximate .",
    "it is in some sense similar to the nachtmann variable in dis which controls some ( kinematical ) part of higher twist contributions .",
    "the reason for the apperance of such a variable is deeply related to the general properties of our model like lorentz invariance @xcite and the on - shellness of partons .    using as input for @xmath21 the lo parameterization of @xcite at the scale @xmath42 , we obtain for @xmath43 and @xmath44-quarks the results shown in fig .",

    "we have studied relations between the tmds @xmath105 and the pdfs @xmath106 .",
    "these relations follow in the covariant parton model as a consequence of lorentz invariance and rotational symmetry of parton momenta in the nucleon rest frame . these relations used with parameterizations of pdfs give numerical predictions for all t - even ( in this work : leading twist ) tmds .",
    "in fact we have demonstrated , that in the framework of the model there are fundamental distributions covariant momentum distributions @xmath34 and @xmath107 from which all the considered unpolarized and polarized pdfs and tmds can be uniquely obtained . and",

    "<S> we derive relations between transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) and the usual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the 3d covariant parton model , which follow from lorentz invariance and the assumption of a rotationally symmetric distribution of parton momenta in the nucleon rest frame . using the known pdfs @xmath0 and @xmath1 as input </S>",
