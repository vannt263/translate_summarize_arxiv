    "<S> first , most of the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] should be outside the quantitative accuracy range of this expression , which is limited to @xmath93k , as the exponent is only a low-@xmath5 limit of the phonon distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , translating the values of @xmath94 used in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the dimensionless coupling constant via @xmath95 gives @xmath96 , which is exceedingly large for the perturbative treatment to hold and lies way outside the allowed range . </S>",
    "<S> this strong coupling also implies a spin - peierls transition at @xmath97 , while no such transition is observed . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , our previous study , which considered small - momentum scattering on acoustic phonon branches  @xcite , required an anomalously strong spin - phonon interaction @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is a serious `` naturalness '' problem with previous theoretical considerations .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless spin - phonon coupling constants are well within the range of the microscopic expectations for the cuprates , @xmath99 , implying extremely low spin - peierls transition temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> while the offered analysis of the physical bounds is not a proof of the validity of our theory , it is certainly a strong argument against the validity of the previous approaches , which require unphysically large spin - phonon coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> _ multi - phonon scattering._we note that for @xmath100 the spin - boson mean - free path in  ( [ ell_sp ] ) saturates at @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> while this is not unphysical , one can still expect that the other , @xmath5-dependent terms may become important for @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> corrections of the order @xmath102 are neglected in our derivation ( see  @xcite ) , since @xmath102 is small in the relevant temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> another possible source of the @xmath5-dependence is the multi - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> superficially , the two - phonon scattering processes have to be negligible because of the smallness of the spin - phonon coupling discussed above . however , there are factors that can compensate for this smallness . first , the two - phonon scattering is less restrictive , as the transverse phonons can also contribute . </S>",
    "<S> second , in the non - bravais lattices , the two - phonon processes are also amplified by the number of atoms in a unit cell , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , for the single - phonon processes , the number of longitudinal phonons that couple to spins via ( [ hsp ] ) is @xmath103 , of which we have chosen only two for our fits in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when a spin - boson scattering is due to the emission or absorption of two phonons , the number of possible processes can be as large as @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> a nave and certainly overly optimistic estimate of their number assuming independent polarization and a branch index for each phonon involved in the scattering yields @xmath105 . in cuprates </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the total number of phonon modes is large , so this combinatorial factor can be substantial .    </S>",
    "<S> a somewhat tedious , but straightforward algebra @xcite yields the following result for the two - phonon scattering @xmath106 where @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> when compared to  ( [ ell_sp ] ) , the result in  ( [ ell_sp2 ] ) contains an extra factor , @xmath108 , and a large combinatorial factor , @xmath109 . clearly , at @xmath58 , the two - phonon mean - free path follows the same behavior as ( [ ell_sp ] ) , thus simply renormalizing single - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> however , at @xmath100 , it carries an extra power of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , thus amounting to an expansion in @xmath112 , which can be argued to follow naturally from the multi - phonon scattering processes .    without going into non - generic microscopic considerations </S>",
    "<S> , one can suggest a simple ansatz to account for the @xmath112-expansion with the @xmath5-dependence of the spin - phonon coupling in the form @xmath113 , where @xmath114 as before . </S>",
    "<S> this form meets both the low-@xmath5 and the high-@xmath5 behavior of the two - phonon mean - free path discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> a fit of the srcuo@xmath2 data using this ansatz with @xmath115 is provided in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bare spin - phonon coupling constants @xmath116 are even smaller than in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , especially for the higher - energy mode . </S>",
    "<S> the result with the bare @xmath116 s is provided for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> although this figure is an illustration showing that our theory allows for systematic extensions by including multi - phonon processes , it also demonstrates a potential role of the latter in the @xmath117 regime and thus contributes to the general description of the heat transport in spin - chain materials .    . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line includes @xmath5-dependence in the spin - phonon coupling ; see the text . ]    </S>",
    "<S> -0.3 cm    _ conclusions._we have provided a consistent microscopic theory for thermal transport and scattering in 1d spin chains which stands out from previous attempts at such a theory by having weak spin - phonon coupling and conforming to the analogy of the phonon scattering to that on impurities . </S>",
    "<S> we have successfully fit the available experimental data and discussed possible extensions of our theory for higher-@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach should be applicable to the thermal conductivity in spin - ladder materials and can be extended to the transport phenomena in a variety of luttinger liquids and ultracold atomic gases . </S>",
    "<S> numerical verification of our results is also called for .    </S>",
