    "theory and computation about complex networks such as the bacterial colonies , interacting ecological species , and the spreading of computer virus over the internet are becoming very promising and they may have important applications in a wide range of areas .",
    "the proper modelling of these networks is a challenging task and the studies in this area are still at very early stage .",
    "however , various techniques and applications have been investigated , especially in the area of computational logic , the internet network , and application of bio - inspired algorithms [ 1 - 7 ] . since the pioneer work of watts and strogatz on small - world networks , a lot of interesting studies on the theory and application of small - world networks [ 7 - 9,12 - 18 ] have been initiated .",
    "more recently , the automata networks have been developed by tomassini and his colleagues @xcite to study the automata network in noise environment .",
    "their study shows that small - world automata networks are less affected by random noise . the properties of complex networks such as population interactions , internet servers , forest fires , ecological species and financial transactions are mainly determined by the way of connections between the vertices or occupied sites .",
    "network modelling and formulations are essentially discrete in the sense that they deal with discrete interactions among discrete nodes of networks because almost all the formulations are in terms of the degrees of clustering , connectivity , average nodal distance and other countable degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , they do not work well for interactions over continuous networks and media . in the later case , modelling and computations",
    "are usually carried out in terms partial differential equations ( pdes ) , however , almost all pdes ( except those with integral boundary conditions ) are local equations because the derivatives and the dependent variable are all evaluated at concurrent locations .",
    "for example , the 3-d reaction - diffusion equation @xmath0 describes the variation of @xmath1 such as temperature and concentration with spatial coordinates @xmath2 and time @xmath3 . while the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 can be constant , but the reaction rate @xmath5 may depends on @xmath6 and location @xmath2 as well as time @xmath3 .",
    "this equation is local because @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are all evaluated at the same point @xmath2 at any given time @xmath3 . now",
    "if we introduce some long - distance shortcuts ( e.g. , a computer virus can spread from one computer to another computer over a long - distance , not necessary local computers ) , then the reaction rate can have a nonlocal influence in a similar manner .",
    "we can now modify the above equation as @xmath9 where @xmath10 depends on the local point @xmath2 and another point @xmath11 far away .",
    "obviously , @xmath10 can be any function form . as a simple example in the 1-d case : @xmath12+\\beta u(x - s , t)$ ] , where @xmath13 is simply a shift and @xmath14 $ ] is a constant .",
    "this equation is nonlocal since the reaction rate depends the values of @xmath6 at both @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath3 .",
    "this simple extension makes it difficult to find analytical solutions .",
    "even numerical solutions are not easy to find because the standard numerical methods do not necessarily converge due to the extra nonlocal term .",
    "this paper will investigate this aspect in detail using unconventional solution methods such as small - world cellular automata networks .",
    "the present work aims to develop a new type of small - world cellular automata by combining local updating rules with a probability of long - range shortcuts to simulate the interactions and behaviour of a complex system . by using a small fraction of sparse long - range shortcut interactions together with the local interactions",
    ", we can simulate the evolution of complex networks .",
    "self - organized criticality will be tested based on the results from the cellular automata .",
    "the important implications in the modelling and applications will also be discussed .",
    "small - world networks are a special class of networks with a high degree of local clustering as well as a small average distance , and this small - world phenomenon can be achieved by adding randomly only a small fraction of the long - range connections , and some common networks such as power grids , financial networks and neural networks behave like small - world networks @xcite .",
    "the application of small - world networks into the modelling of infection occurring locally and at a distance was first carried out by boots and sasaki @xcite with some interesting results .",
    "the dynamic features such as spreading and response of an influence over a network have also been investigated in recent studies @xcite by using shortest paths in system with sparse long - range connections in the frame work of small - world models .",
    "the influence propagates from the infected site to all uninfected sites connected to it via a link at each time step , whenever a long - range connection or shortcut is met ; the influence is newly activated at the other end of the shortcut so as to simulate long - range sparkling effect .",
    "these phenomena have successfully been studied by newman and watts model @xcite and moukarzel @xcite .",
    "their models are linear in the sense that the governing equation is linear and the response is immediate as there is no time delay in their models @xcite .",
    "more recently , one of the most interesting studies has been carried out by de arcaneglis and herrmann @xcite using the classic height model on a lattice , which implied the self - organized criticality in the small - world system concerned .    on the other hand ,",
    "cellular automata have been used to simulate many processes such as lattice gas , fluid flow , reaction - diffusion and complex systems @xcite in terms of interaction rules rather than the conventional partial differential equations .",
    "compared to the equation - based models , simulations in term of cellular automata are more stable due to their finite states and local interacting rules @xcite .",
    "in fact , in most cases , the pde models are equivalent to rule - based cellular automata if the local rules can be derived from the corresponding pde models @xcite , and thus both pde models and ca rules can simulate the same process @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that cellular automata networks are a better approach for solving nonlocal equation - based models .",
    "the rest of the present paper will focus on : 1 ) to formulate a cellular automaton network on a 2-d lattice grid with sparse long - range shortcuts ; 2 ) to simulate the transition and complexity concerning small - world nonlocal interactions ; 3 ) to test the self - organized criticality of the constructed network systems ; 4 ) to find the characteristics of any possible transition .",
    "earlier studies on cellular automata use local rules updating the state of each cell and the influence is local .",
    "that is to say , the state at the next time step is determined by the states of the present cell concerned and those of its immediate surrounding neighbour cells .",
    "even the simple rules can produce complex patterns @xcite .",
    "the rule and its locality determine the characteristics of the cellular automata .",
    "in fact , we do not have to restrict that the rules must be local , and in general the influence can be either local or nonlocal .",
    "thus , we can assume the rules of cellular automata can be either local or nonlocal or even global .",
    "the state of a cell can be determined by @xmath17 cells consisting of @xmath18 immediate neighbour cells and @xmath19 other cells at longer distance . in the case of local rules only ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , then the rules are nonlocal",
    ". if @xmath17 is the same order of the total cells @xmath23 of the cellular automaton , then rules are global .",
    "nonlocal interactions rule for lattice - gas system was first developed by appert and zaleski in the discussion of a new momentum - conserving lattice - gas model allowing the particles exchange momentum between distant sites @xcite .",
    "some properties of local and nonlocal site exchange deterministic cellular automata were investigated by researchers @xcite .",
    "as the nonlocal rules are different from the local rules , it is naturally expected that the nonlocal rules may lead to different behavior from conventional local rule - based cellular automata .",
    "furthermore , self - organized criticality has been found in many systems in nature pioneered by bak and his colleagues @xcite .",
    "one can expect that there may be cases when self - organized criticality , cellular automata , and small - world phenomena can occur at the same time . more specifically ,",
    "if a finite - state cellular automaton with a small - fraction of long - range shortcuts is formulated , a natural question is : do the self - organized criticality exist in the small - world cellular automaton ?",
    "is there any transition in the system ?",
    "a cellular automaton is a finite - state machine defined on a regular lattice in @xmath24-dimensional case , and the state of a cell is determined by the current state of the cell and the states of its neighbour cells @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we use 2-d in our discussions .",
    "a state @xmath25 of a cell @xmath26 at time step @xmath27 can be written in terms of the previous states @xmath28 where summation is over the @xmath29 moore neighbourhood cells . in the @xmath24-dimensional case ,",
    "there are @xmath30 moore neighbourhood cells .",
    "@xmath31 is the size of the 2-d automaton , and @xmath32 are the coefficients . for the simplest and well - known 2-d conway s game of life @xmath33 for 8 neighbour cells ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "now let us introduce some nonlocal influence from some sparse long - range cells ( see fig .",
    "1 ) by combining small - world long - range shortcuts and conventional cellular automata to form a new type of cellular automata networks .      for simplicity",
    ", we define a small - world cellular automaton network as a local cellular automaton with an additional fraction or probability @xmath35 of sparse long - range nonlocal shortcuts ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath36 immediate neumann neighbours and @xmath37 nonlocal cells ,",
    "the updating rule for a cell becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a control parameter that can turn the long - range cells on ( @xmath40 ) or off ( @xmath41 ) depending on the probability @xmath35 .",
    "the probability @xmath35 is the fractions of long - range shortcuts in the total of every possible combinations . for @xmath23 cells ,",
    "there are @xmath42 possible connections .",
    "the simplest form of @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a heaviside function .",
    "@xmath46 is a critical probability , and @xmath46 can be taken as to be zero in most simulations in this paper .",
    "the updating rules are additive and thus form a subclass of special rules .",
    "we can extend the above updating rules to a generalized form , but we are only interested in additive rules here because they may have interesting properties and can easily be transformed to differential equations . in addition , the neighourhood can be either extended moore neighourhood or neumann neighbourhood . for moore neighbourhood , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "our numerical experiments seem to indicate that moore neighbourhood is more sensitive for avalanche and neumann neighbourhood is more stable for pattern formation .",
    "a simple case for a small - world cellular automaton in 2-d case is @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( or any @xmath51 ) so that it has 5 immediate neumann neighbour cells and 2 shortcuts .",
    "the distance between the nonlocal cells to cell @xmath26 can be defined as @xmath52 the nonlocality requires @xmath53 the nonlocal influence can also be introduced in other ways .",
    "alternatively , we can use the conventional local rule - based cellular automaton and adding the long - distance shortcuts between some cells in a random manner .",
    "the probability @xmath35 of the long - range shortcuts in all the possible connections is usually very small . under certain conditions ,",
    "these two formulations are equivalent .",
    "more generally , a finite - state cellular automaton with a transition rule @xmath54 \\;\\;(i , j=1,2, ... ,n)$ ] from one state @xmath55 \\;\\;(i , j=1,2, ... ,n)$ ] at time level @xmath56 to a new state @xmath57 \\;\\;(i , j=1,2, ... ,n)$ ] at time level @xmath27 can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 takes the same form as equation ( [ equ - rule ] ) for small - world cellular automata .",
    "of long - range shortcuts , width=336,height=192 ]    the state of each cell can be taken to be discrete or continuous . from simplicity",
    ", we use @xmath60-valued discrete system and for most of the simulations in the rest of the paper , we use @xmath61 ( thus , each cell can only be @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) for self - criticality testing , and @xmath64 for pattern formation",
    ". other numbers of states can be used to meet the need of higher accuracies .",
    "by using the small - world cellular automaton formulated in the previous section , a large number of computer simulations have been carried out in order to find the statistic characteristics of the complex patterns and behaviour arising from cellular automata networks with different probabilities @xmath35 of long - range shortcuts .",
    "numerical simulations are carried out on an @xmath23 lattice in 2-d setting , and usually , @xmath65 , or up to @xmath66 .",
    "different simulations with different lattice size are compared to ensure the simulated results are independent of the lattice size and time steps . in the rest of the paper , we present some results concerning the features of transition and self - organized criticality of small - world cellular automata .      for a lattice size of @xmath67 with a fixed @xmath35 , a single cell is randomly selected and perturbed by flipping its state in order to simulate an event of avalanche in 2-d automata networks with the standard moore neighbourhood and game - of - life updating rules , but a probability @xmath35 is used to add long - range shortcuts to the cellular automaton .",
    "a shortcut forces the two connecting cells having the same state .",
    "figure 2 shows the avalanche size distribution for two different values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the avalanche size is defined as the number of cells affected by any single flipping perturbation .    in the double logarithmic plot ,",
    "the data follows two straight lines .",
    "it is clearly seen that there exists a power law in the distribution , and the gradient of the straight line is the exponent of the power - law distribution .",
    "a least - square fitting of @xmath70 , leads to the exponents of @xmath71 for @xmath68 and @xmath72 for @xmath69 .",
    "although a power - law distribution does not necessarily mean the self - organized criticality .",
    "self - organized criticality has been observed in other systems [ 1 - 4,26 ] .",
    "the pattern formed in the system is quasi - stable and a little perturbation to the equilibrium state usually causes avalanche - like readjustment in the system imply the self - organized criticality in the evolution of complex patterns of the cellular automaton .",
    "this is the first time of its kind by using computer simulations to demonstrate the feature of self - organized criticality on a _ cellular automaton network_. we can also see in figure 2 that different probabilities @xmath35 will lead to different values of exponents .",
    "the higher the probability , the steeper the slope .          for a fixed grid of @xmath73 cells",
    ", we can vary the probability @xmath35 to see what can happen . for a single event of flipping state ,",
    "the fraction of population affected is plotted versus @xmath35 in a semi - logarithmic plot as shown in figure 3 where the fraction of population is defined as the number ( @xmath74 ) of cells affected among the whole population @xmath75 , that is @xmath76 .",
    "the sharp increase of the fraction versus the probability @xmath35 indicates a transition in the properties of cellular automata networks . for a very small probability @xmath77 , the influence of the event mainly behaves in a similar way as the conventional local cellular automata . as the probability increases ,",
    "a transition occurs at about @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    ", any event will affect the whole population .",
    "this feature of transition is consistent with the typical small - world networks @xcite .",
    "of long - range shortcuts.,width=288,height=240 ]    comparing with the local rule - based cellular automata , the transition in small - world cellular automata is an interesting feature . without such shortcuts , there was no transition observed in the simulations .",
    "however , self - organized criticality was still observed in finite - state cellular automata @xcite without transition . in the present case , both self - organized criticality and transition emerge naturally .",
    "thus , the transition in cellular automata networks suggests that this transition may be the result of nonlocal interactions by long - range shortcuts .",
    "this feature of transition may have important implications when applied to the modelling of real - world phenomena such as the internet and social networks . for a system with few or no long - range interactions",
    ", there is no noticeable change in its behavior in transition .",
    "however , as the long - range shortcuts or interacting components increase a little bit more , say to @xmath78 , then a transition may occur and thus any event can affect a large fraction of the whole population .",
    "for example , to increase the speed of finding information on the internet , a small fraction of long - range shortcuts in terms of website portals and search engine ( e.g. , google ) and high - capacity / bandwidth connections could significantly increase the performance of the system concerned .",
    "in addition , the self - organized criticality can also imply some interesting properties of the internet and other small - world networks , and these could serve as some topics for further research .",
    "the evolution of a system can usually be described by two major ways : rule - based systems and equation - based systems .",
    "the rule - based systems are typically discrete and use local rules such as cellular automata or finite difference system . as discussed by",
    "many researchers @xcite , the finite difference systems are equivalent to cellular automata if the updating rules for the cellular automata are derived directly from their equation - based counterpart . on the other hand ,",
    "the equation - based systems are typically continuous and they are often written as partial differential equations .",
    "sometimes , the same system can described using these two different ways . however , there is no universal relationship between a rule - based system and an equation - based system @xcite .",
    "given differential equation , it is possible to construct a rule - based cellular automaton by discretizing the differential equations , but it is far more complicated to formulate a system of partial differential equations for a given cellular automaton .",
    "for example , the following 2-d partial differential equation for nonlinear pattern formation for @xmath80 @xmath81 can always be written as an equivalent cellular automaton if the local rules of cellular automaton are obtained from the pde .",
    "conversely , a local cellular automaton can lead to a local system of partial differential equation ( pde ) , if the construction is possible @xcite .",
    "a local pde can generally be written as @xmath82    a nonlocal pde can be written as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the the averaged distance of long - range shortcuts and @xmath35 is the probability of nonlocal long - range shortcuts . in order to show what a nonlocal equation means , we modify the above equation for pattern formation as @xmath85.\\ ] ] this nonlocal equation is far more complicated than equation ( 8) .",
    "for the proposed cellular automaton networks , a system of nonlocal partial differential equations will be derived , though the explicit form of a generic form is very difficult to obtain and this requires further research .",

    "for example , the following nonlinear partial differential equation for pattern formation @xmath80 @xmath88 can be discretized using central finite difference scheme in space with @xmath89 .",
    "then , it is equivalent to @xmath90 where @xmath34 , @xmath91 .",
