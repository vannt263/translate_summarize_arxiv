    "it was established theoretically quite some time ago , that in magnetic systems with broken inversion symmetry , the _ dzyaloshinskii - moriya _ ( dm ) exchange interactions stabilize long - period modulations of the magnetization vector propagating with a fixed rotation sense along one ( _ helices _ ) @xcite or two ( _ skyrmions _ ) @xcite spatial directions .    since the year 1976 , chiral helical modulations have been identified by magnetization measurements and polarized small - angle neutron scattering techniques in several classes of bulk noncentrosymmetric magnetic crystals including an extending group of cubic helimagnets with b20-type structure ( space group @xmath02@xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "specific magnetic anomalies reported to occur near the ordering temperature of bulk cubic helimagnets indicate the existence of multidimensional chiral modulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and are in accordance with theoretical predictions of skyrmion textures @xcite .",
    "recently , the fabrication of high - quality thin films of noncentrosymmetric cubic and uniaxial ferromagnets @xcite and nanolayers of common magnetic metals with surface / interface dm interactions @xcite have provided a material basis for detailed investigations of chiral modulations and possibilities for applications in spintronic devices @xcite . despite such extensive focus , the precise spin - structure of skyrmions and the basis for their energetic predominance over the helical and conical states @xcite , which also arise from competition between symmetric ferromagnetic exchange and antisymmetric dm interaction , has not yet been fully explained @xcite .",
    "more recently a number of image based observations , utilising image reconstruction based on the transport of intensity equation ( tie ) , from the fresnel mode of lorentz transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) or magnetic force microscopy @xcite have provided insight into general skyrmion form , lattice arrangement and behaviour .",
    "holographic tem imaging has been applied to lattice skyrmions in ( fe , co)si where the reconstruction obtained provided higher , but not precisely quoted , spatial resolution characterisation @xcite .",
    "the resulting interpretation was that lattice skyrmions possessed cylindrical symmetry and showed no variation in magnetic structure through the thickness of the nano - wedge sample . in ref .",
    "@xcite spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) has been applied to resolve the internal structure of isolated skyrmions in nanolayers pdfe / ir ( 111 ) with interface induced dm interactions .",
    "these skyrmions are an order of magnitude smaller and possess spin structures distinct from lattice skyrmions observed in bulk cubic heli - magnets .    in this article",
    ", we report results obtained using a novel high spatial resolution imaging method capable of providing quantitative measurements of the magnetic induction distribution in modulated states of different classes of noncentrosymmetric magnets . using differential phase contrast ( dpc ) imaging , performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope ( stem ) , we reveal the internal magnetic spin profile of lattice skyrmions in a freestanding nano - wedge of fege at t=250k .",
    "stabilized by the influence of an applied magnetic field , our imaging shows that the average lattice skyrmion possesses intrinsic six - fold symmetry and profile measurements reveal that the width of the skyrmion core decreases as the field strength is increased , accompanied by changes in the lattice periodicity .",
    "furthermore , through utilising an enhanced detection scheme we show that , although the arrangement of lattice skyrmions is highly periodic , there is a significant level of individual structure variation which for some skyrmions results in their spin profile symmetry being reduced .",
    "this observation documents a more subtle alteration than recent works which have highlighted distortions to the skyrmion lattice through fresnel imaging@xcite and to skyrmions themselves , also by dpc imaging @xcite , at a crystal grain boundary .    within a standard phenomenological model",
    "@xcite we derive rigorous solutions for skyrmion lattice cells in thin layers of cubic helimagnets at different applied fields .",
    "we also predict that the structure of the skyrmion lattice includes regions of twisting of the in - plane magnetisation close to the material surfaces in which it is confined and that these surface states lead to energetic stabilisation of the skyrmion lattice over the conical state .",
    "finally we consider our experimentally observed evolution of the skyrmion lattice structure and find consistency with our presented theoretical model .",
    "benefitting from developments in aberration correction for electron optics we have recently improved the range of sensitivity and spatial resolution , to better than @xmath2 , available from the differential phase contrast ( dpc ) imaging mode @xcite . for the purpose of imaging skyrmions in b20 structured fege ,",
    "a wedge shaped specimen with @xmath3 normal was extracted from a vapour grown bulk single crystal sample ( details of preparation and characterisation given in supplementary information ) .",
    "the thickness of the wedge increased linearly from @xmath4 over a distance of @xmath5 from it s apex and was thin enough to be suitably transmitting for 200kev electrons , figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions ] . for electrons at normal incidence",
    "the beam is only sensitive to the in - plane magnetic induction components of the skyrmions as dictated by understanding based on the wave - optical aharanov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "as the focused electron beam possesses much smaller diameter than the period of the in - plane magnetisation curling , for each point in a raster scan , the phase shift of the traversing electron waves manifests itself at the detector plane as an angular deflection of the transmitted electron cone , as shown in figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](a ) . for this work we have chosen to employ an increased probe size , half - width @xmath6 , in order to obtain a reduced probe semi - convergence angle of @xmath7 and therefore greater sensitivity to @xmath8 angular displacements .",
    "direct viewing of the angular displacements is achieved by forming orthogonal difference images ( e.g. a - c and b - d ) and constitutes a differentiation of the electron wave - phase gradients induced by the sample .",
    "figures [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](b ) @xmath9 ( c ) show the orthogonal dpc difference images obtained from a relatively flat region of the specimen containing lattice skyrmions with an applied field ( supplied by the partially excited objective lens ) of strength @xmath10 . performing dpc imaging with an annular , rather than solid",
    ", detector provides a means by which to suppress unwanted differential contrast from non - magnetic origins @xcite . in this case signals from the inner segments e , f , g , h were used to subtract minor differential contrast variations from diffraction by weak bend contours . as can be observed in figures [ fig :",
    "dpc_explain_skyrmions](b ) @xmath9 ( c ) both show strong contrast with periodic variation of the grey level .",
    "further direct maps of the variation of direction and strength of the in - plane magnetic induction can be revealed by mathematically combining the information from the orthogonal component images figures [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](b ) @xmath9 ( c ) .",
    "an arc - tangent operation yields the in - plane induction directions which are mapped to a colourwheel .",
    "figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](d ) shows the periodic in - plane rotation associated with each of 15 full skyrmions that can be seen , in this case all possessing clockwise chirality as dictated by the single sign of the dmi constant .",
    "the overall magntiude of the in - plane moments are obtained through quadratic summation of the difference images ( e.g. @xmath11 ) , figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](e ) , and show that each skyrmion is characterised by a ring of intensity , corresponding to where the moments gain an in - plane component as they twist from one out - of - plane orientation at the periphery of the skyrmion to the opposite out - plane - orientation at it s core . combining information from both figures [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](d ) @xmath9 ( e ) yields a quantitative in - plane vector image of the skyrmion lattice , figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](f ) .",
    "this figure bears close resemblance to vector maps produced from tie - based reconstructions already published .",
    "however , in this case the intrinsic spatial resolution , at @xmath6 , is higher and thus the image contains contributions from a much wider range of spatial frequencies .        in order to reduce the influence from statistical noise and natural variations in the lattice skyrmion structure , averaged dpc difference images , figures [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](a),(b )",
    "were produced by calculating mean intensity maps over a number , @xmath12 , of lattice skyrmions from figures [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions](b),(c ) .",
    "the averaged difference images were then combined to produce maps of the in - plane magnitude , figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](c ) and the in - plane colour vectors , figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](d ) . taken together figures [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged ] ( c)@xmath9(d ) yield a clear view that the average lattice skyrmion possesses a hexagonal form . from the averaged dpc difference images figures [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](b),(c )",
    "a bivariate histogram analysis was performed , figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](e ) , allowing visualisation of the quantitative distribution of electron beam deflection , @xmath13 , from across the skyrmion structure . from figure",
    "[ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](e ) it can be observed that the histogram is composed of six spokes , numbered 1 - 6 , and an outer ring , numbered 7 .",
    "the latter relates to the strongest deflections experienced by beam and were measured at @xmath14 , corresponding to regions where the skyrmion is magnetised completely in - plane .",
    "the magnitude of maximum deflection angle @xmath15 is equivalent to a magnetic induction thickness product , @xmath16 .",
    "the region of the specimen in which the images were acquired was measured to have thickness in the range @xmath17 and thus the strength of the induction can be inferred to be @xmath18 . as the electron beam is only sensitive to in - plane components of induction , in the absence of strong domain wall features with associated magnetisation divergence acting as sources of stray magnetic field",
    ", it is justifiable to assume that @xmath13 is a measurement of the strength of the in - plane magnetisation . our value for the magnetic induction agrees well with measurements of magnetisation performed for bulk fege .",
    "lundgren et al .",
    "@xcite measured a magnetic moment of @xmath19 per fe atom which translates to a saturation induction @xmath20 . from a fitted brillouin function , at @xmath21",
    "they also measured magnetisation to be reduced by @xmath22 , yielding @xmath23 .",
    "returning to figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](e ) , the bivariate histogram provides a strong depiction of intrinsic symmetry within the skyrmion through the presence of six spokes , numbered 1 - 6 , projecting inwards towards the histogram centre and the hexagonal appearance of the outer ring , numbered 7 .",
    "figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](f ) plots the radially averaged intensity profile produced by sweeping the line , indicated in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](c ) , through a full rotation about the skyrmion core . from figure",
    "[ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](f ) it can be seen that the average skyrmion has a measured radius of 40 @xmath24 .",
    "taking together all of our imaging and analyses in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged ] we deduce that in common with their lattice symmetry , the average lattice skyrmion possesses a hexagonally symmetric internal structure in this case .",
    "previously it has been reported that purely cylindrical rotation was observed by electron holography in fecosi@xcite , our measurements indicate a more subtle variation in the fege system .",
    "the evolution of lattice skyrmion structure in response to an applied field was studied by forming average skyrmions from dpc lattice images , at field strengths from 796 to 1938 oe , figure [ fig : dpc_sk_profiles](a - e)(colour vector images of the skyrmion lattices from which the average skyrmions are produced can be viewed in figure s5 of the supplementary information ) .",
    "it can be seen that the skyrmion remained similar at all field strengths although the diameter of the core appeared to reduce with increasing field strength .",
    "this was confirmed by radially analysing the intensity profile from magnitude images , as was performed earlier in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](f ) .",
    "plotting profiles as a function of applied field in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_profiles](f ) showed that the core radius decreased by @xmath25 ( and hence diameter = @xmath26 ) , evidenced by inward shifting of the peak position , from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "this observation is highly important since it signifies that the magnetic structure of the bloch type skyrmions in this system is not fixed but results from energetic interplay between various terms and that the skyrmion profile is a non - linear response to this .",
    "furthermore , that the core reduces in diameter with increasing field strength , supports the core magnetisation , which lies out of plane , is oriented anti - parallel to both the applied field and to the magnetisation at the skyrmion boundary .",
    "as our images in figure [ fig : dpc_explain_skyrmions ] showed , skyrmions form highly ordered lattices , but on an invidual basis there appears to be a natural level of structural variation . in order to investigate this further , we employed an enhanced dpc method that we have developed where a pixelated detector ( medipix3@xcite , 256x256 pixels ) replaced the segmented detector@xcite . for each electron beam scan location on the specimen ,",
    "images of the transmitted bright field electron disc were obtained .",
    "routines for processing the resulting 4d dataset have been developed by us @xcite in order to attain measurement of the lorentz deflection of the electron disc with better than sub - pixel accuracy . applying this method",
    "we have produced dpc component and colour in - plane vector images of lattice skyrmions for @xmath29 in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](a)-(c ) ( stem images 256x256 pixels , beam convergence semi - angle @xmath30 , spatial resolution better than @xmath2 , pixel resolution @xmath31 ) .",
    "as our pixelated detector directly counts single electrons with zero noise , we gain greater sensitivity and can reduce the statistical uncertainty of the disc deflection measurement to a variance of @xmath32 , or @xmath33 of lorentz beam deflection .",
    "thus , from figures [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](a)@xmath9(b ) , bivariate histogram analyses can be performed for individual skyrmions whereas previously with the segmented detector this was only possible for the averaged lattice skyrmion in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](e ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](d ) we show a map highlighting four individual skyrmions from the lattice seen in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](c ) .",
    "a bivariate histogram for the topmost skyrmion is shown in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](e ) where it can be seen that the histogram again consists of six symmetry spokes , numbered 1 - 6 , and an outer ring , numbered 7 .",
    "in contrast to figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged](e ) , the outer ring depicts an increased angular deflection larger than @xmath34 which we ascribe to the data here being acquired from thicker region of the nanowedge , @xmath35 , than that in figure [ fig : dpc_sk_averaged ] . in order to understand how the features of the bivariate historam correspond to real space locations within the structure of the skyrmion we have selected and colour coded these , as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](f ) , and reconstructed each in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](g ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](g ) it can be seen that the symmetry spokes numbered 1 - 6 in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](f ) correspond to discrete zones at the corner regions of the skyrmion and also to regions which project inwards towards it s centre .",
    "the outer ring in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](f ) numbered 7 , where the in - plane magnetic component of magnetic induction is strongest , occupies the region midway between the boundary and the skyrmion centre in figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](g ) . relating the form of the bivariate histograms to the real space features highlights that this is an effective method by which to characterise distortions . a key indicator of symmetry reduction is given by the symmetry spokes not possessing equal angular separation , which , in real space , corresponds to unequal hexagon boundary lengths . a clear example is shown when comparing figures [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](f ) and ( g ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](f ) symmetry spokes 1,2 and 3 have a closer angular spacing than spokes 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "examination of figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](g ) reveals that the side lengths of the boundaries of the skyrmion are shorter for 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 than the other sides .",
    "similar distortions are evident in figures [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](h)-(j ) and by referring back to figure [ fig : fig_indiv_sk_variation](d ) for locations in figure(c ) this observation can be correlated to there being non - equal hexagon boundary lengths and non - equal areal occupation of the colour domains within individual skyrmions . in the present study we were unable to correlate the observed variations in symmetry with any identifiable features in the single crystal samples although we can not rule out that such distortions might have been caused by undetected strain or bending of the specimen .",
    "the standard model for magnetic states in cubic non - centrosymmetric ferromagnets is based on the energy density functional @xcite @xmath36 with the principal interactions essential to stabilize modulated states : the exchange stiffness with constant @xmath37 , dzyaloshinskii - moriya coupling energy with constant @xmath38 , and the zeeman energy ; @xmath39 is the unity vector along the magnetization vector @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the magnetic field applied along the @xmath42 axis .",

    "the skyrmions preserve axisymmetric distribution of the magnetization and the energy densities only near the centers of the hexagonal cells ( the hexagonal cells are marked by the white - colored hexagons in figs . [ structure ] ( b)-(e ) ) while the inter - skyrmion regions are strongly distorted .",
    "it is the consequence of an inherent frustration built into models with chiral couplings : the system can not fill the whole space with the ideal , energetically most favoured double - twisted motifs . in particular , the vertices of the hexagon",
    "serve as sources for triangular regions of anti - skyrmions ( marked by the dashed line in fig .",

    "@xcite ) , acquires hexagonal symmetry once skyrmions are condensed into the lattice .",
    "the situation is opposite along the apothems of the hexagons : the smooth rotation of the magnetization from one skyrmion center to another leads to the lower dm energy density ( fig .",

    "furthermore , our model predicts that lattice skyrmions in a free - standing nanowedge could possess significant three - dimensional structure variation through the existence of twist states close to the material surfaces and which stabilise the skyrmion lattice phase . from the experimental results reported here we are unable to confirm the presence of surface states but we are currently conducting careful investigations to find evidence or otherwise of their existence .",
    "having demonstrated the capacity of the lattice skyrmion internal structure and lattice period to be altered in response to an applied field , our observation of natural structure variation is perhaps not so surprising . that symmetry lowering distortions of the internal structure occur , suggest that these are likely in response to a source of intrinsic strain .    whether the source is mechanical , from strain distributions within the nanowedge crystal , or due to `` magnetic '' strain distributions in the skyrmion crystal lattice itself",

    "<S> an out - plane applied magnetic field , mapping of the in - plane component of magnetic induction has revealed precise spin profiles and that the internal structure possesses intrinsic six - fold symmetry . with increasing field strength , the diameter of skyrmion cores was measured to decrease and accompanied by a non - linear variation of the lattice periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> variations in structure for individual skyrmions across an area of the lattice were also studied utilising a new increased sensitivity dpc detection scheme and a variety of symmetry lowering distortions were observed . to provide insight into fundamental energetics </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed a phenomenological model , with which our experimental observations of spin profiles and field induced core diameter variation are in good agreement with predicted structure in the middle of the nanowedge crystal . in the vicinity of the crystal surfaces </S>",
    "<S> , our model predicts the existence of in - plane twisting distortions which our current experimental observations were not sensitive to . as an alternative to the requirement for as yet unidentified sources of magnetic anisotropy </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that surface states could provide the energetic stabilisation needed for predomination over the conical magnetic phase . </S>"
