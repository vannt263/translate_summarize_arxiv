    "adiabatic charge pumping through open quantum dots was studied recently in the literature both theoretically @xcite and experimentally .",
    "such pumping occurs in a system described by a hamiltonian periodic in time with a period @xmath0 larger than all other characteristic time scales of the system .",
    "after one period , the system returns to its initial form ; however charge @xmath1 can be transmitted through a cross  section of the system : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes quantum mechanical and thermodynamic averaging .    to obtain a finite transmitted charge at low frequencies ,",
    "the hamiltonian should depend on at least two parameters .",
    "in refs.@xcite the time dependence of the hamiltonian was replaced by a dependence on parameters and the system was considered quasistationary for each parameter value .",
    "the transported charge during one period of the hamiltonian was calculated as an integral in the parameter space .",
    "the theory @xcite shed some light on the recent experiments , namely on the amplitude dependence of the root mean square fluctuations of the transmitted charge , averaged over different realizations of the hamiltonian .",
    "a very similar phenomenon was considered previously by falko and khmelnitskii , who theoretically studied the photovoltaic effect in mesoscopic microjunctions @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation is described in ref .",
    "the photovoltaic effect is a generation of d.c .- current by radiation of a finite frequency .",
    "( it is obvious that this effect can only be non  linear in the oscillating field . )",

    "the purpose of the present work is to go beyond the adiabatic approximation for d.c .- current generation in open quantum dots .",

    "we will see that the separation onto reversible and irreversible parts goes far beyond the bilinear and low frequency expansions .",
    "we will find that the reversible part vanishes at high frequency whereas the irreversible part saturates .",
    "we will also show that the irreversible contribution may be interpreted in a manner similar to adiabatic pumping . in adiabatic pumping the transmitted charge",
