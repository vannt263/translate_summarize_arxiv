    "* ) , the correlation is often construed as evidence for agn feedback to regulate the growth of smbhs and bulges .",
    "the idea that agn feedback may alleviate problems in galaxy formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further enhances its appeal .",
    "the three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations successfully reproduced the observed @xmath4/@xmath5 ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing the physical basis for this scenario .",
    "this _ letter _ has two goals .",
    "first , we make a qualitative examination of the implications of the observed relation between bulges and the central massive objects ( cmos ) , wherein the two follow a linear relation over four decades in mass .",
    "it is shown that neither the smbhs nor the nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) nor the stellar bulges could have played a dominant role in regulating the growth of any of the three components in the way of blowing away a significant fraction of gas already landed in the respective regions so as to produce the cmo - bulge relation .",
    "second , an alternative model is put forth wherein the correlation between smbh mass and bulge mass is dictated by the angular momentum distribution of the infalling gas .",
    "we successfully test this new scenario using _ ab initio _ * l*arge - scale * a*daptive - mesh - refinement * o*mniscient * z*oom-*i*n ( * laozi * ) cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "with the acs virgo cluster survey of early - type galaxies spanning four decades in mass , @xcite and @xcite find a transition at @xmath7 , where the brighter galaxies lack resolved stellar nuclei and smbhs dominate the cmo mass , while fainter ones have resolved stellar nuclei that dominate the cmo mass .",
    "furthermore , the logarithm of the mean nucleus - to - galaxy luminosity ratio in fainter , nucleated galaxies , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is indistinguishable from that of the smbh - to - bulge mass ratio , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . a similar result is found by @xcite using a different data set .",
    "@xcite find an identical relation using early - type galaxies in the acs fornax cluster survey .",
    "we express the universal scaling relation between cmos and bulges as @xmath12 whereby with the transition between nsc and smbh occurs at @xmath13 or stellar mass @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "one may express regulation of the growth of bulges as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the feedback strength coefficients per unit mass of the respective components exerted on the stellar bulge and the ejected gas mass is equal to @xmath20 ; @xmath6 is the velocity dispersion of the stellar bulge ; @xmath21 is a parameter that absorbs uncertainties regarding the dynamics of concerned feedback processes , with @xmath22 for energy - conserving feedback ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have units of energy per unit mass ) and @xmath23 for momentum - conserving feedback ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 have units of momentum per unit mass ) .",
    "note that a significant feedback regulation means @xmath24 .",
    "insights can be gained by asking the following question : can the feedback from smbh and nscs conspire to regulate the growth of the stellar bulge , i.e. , @xmath25 the single powerlaw relation between @xmath26 and @xmath5 across four decades in bulge mass can be understood , only if the negative feedback per unit stellar mass of the nsc and of the smbh are approximately the same , @xmath27 , barring the unknown physical reason for the right hand side of eq  ( [ eq : cmo ] ) - the required amount of notional feedback to regulate the bulge growth - to change character abruptly at @xmath28 .",
    "although having @xmath27 may be possible , it would render a negative answer to the question above ( eq  [ eq : cmo ] ) , as follows . in the momentum driven regime , since the feedback from the nuclear cluster is subject to higher densities and shorter cooling timescales hence diminished strength in comparison to that in the stellar bulge , i.e. , @xmath29 . in the energy driven feedback scenario , @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 , the supernova feedback from stars in the bulge would vastly exceed that from the nsc .",
    "this thus invalidates the statement that the nsc and smbh provide the necessary feedback to regulate the growth of the bulge . the only scenario left for the smbh to regulate the bulge growth is to force @xmath32 and assume the feedback per unit smbh mass , while constant at @xmath33 , to become negligible at about @xmath28 . in both the momentum ( @xmath23 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and energy feedback scenario ( @xmath22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the amount of momentum or energy per unit smbh mass , @xmath17 , is ultimately proportional to the driving energy ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is speed of light ) .",
    "thus , there exists no known process to suddenly make @xmath17 drop to zero at some specific @xmath4 , while being constant otherwise .",
    "if negative feedback is needed to internally regulate the bulge , the only alternative left is stellar feedback from bulge stars themselves , i.e. , @xmath36 under the assumption that the feedback strength from stars per unit mass ( @xmath19 ) is constant , one obtains @xmath37 , which has the same dependence on @xmath6 as the predicted mass loading factors for both momentum ( @xmath23 ) or energy ( @xmath22 ) driven winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , bulge self - regulation , if required , would be physically supportable and self - consistent . if bulge is self - regulated , then , under the assumption that @xmath38 , nsc may also be self - regulated .",
    "the correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath5 would then require that the mass loading factor for the smbh is the same as for the nsc , i.e. , @xmath40 , which is a fine - tuned outcome . in the absence of inter - regulation between cmos and bulges , the proportions of the amount of gas feeding",
    "the nuclear and bulge regions must be proportional to the observed @xmath41 ratio .",
    "our arguments in the previous section indicate that the observed @xmath26-@xmath5 correlation requires the same proportionality in the initial amounts of gas feeding the respective regions , averaged over the cosmological time scales .",
    "we test this scenario using direct cosmological simulations .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description of the _ ab initio _ * laozi * simulations .",
    "briefly , we use the wmap7-normalized @xcite @xmath42cdm model : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . a zoom - in box of size @xmath49mpc@xmath50 comoving is embedded in a @xmath51mpc periodic box .",
    "the maximum resolution is better than @xmath52pc ( physical ) at all times .",
    "star formation follows the prescription of @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite with feedback energy being distributed into 27 local gas cells weighted by the specific volume of each cell , to mimic the process of supernova blastwave propagation to channel more energy into the less dense regions .",
    "we exclude agn feedback in order to ascertain the lack of need for it .",
    "galaxies are identified using the hop algorithm @xcite grouping stellar particles .",
    "galaxy catalogs are constructed from @xmath53 to @xmath54 with an increment of @xmath55 and from @xmath54 to @xmath56 with @xmath57 , having a temporal resolution of @xmath58myr . for each galaxy at @xmath53 a genealogical line is constructed up to @xmath56 , where the parent of each galaxy is identified with the one at the next higher redshift with the most overlap in stellar mass . at each redshift , we compute the amount ( @xmath59 ) and mean specific angular momentum ( @xmath60 ) of gas in the central @xmath61kpc region .",
    "to proceed , an ansatz is made : the gas mass with angular momentum lower than @xmath62 is @xmath63 .",
    "we use @xmath23 , which corresponds to a @xcite disc of surface density @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath23 is motivated by simulations of @xcite with resolution as high as 0.1pc .",
    "figure 12 of @xcite shows that the evolved density runs of the gas discs , on average , follow the @xmath65 profile from 0.1pc to 1kpc . in all of the six individual cases with significant gas inflow , shown in figures ( 2 , 3 ) of @xcite , the @xmath65 profile provides an excellent fit .",
    "we compute the 1-d stellar velocity dispersion @xmath6 within the effective radius for each galaxy in the simulation at any redshift and assume an smbh of mass equal to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the bondi radius is @xmath67 and the specific angular momentum at @xmath68 is @xmath69 the gas landing within @xmath70 is assumed to accrete to the smbh , where at @xmath71 the disc has toomre @xmath72 parameter below unity and is hence consumed by star formation . expressing various parameters by their fiducial values , we have @xmath73 ( eq 42 , * ? ? ?",

    ", we use @xmath83 bearing in mind that uncertainties are at least on the order of unity . to see how uncertainty in @xmath21 affects results ,",
    "we note , a 25% deviation in @xmath21 from unity causes @xmath84 in eq  ( [ eq : mfeed ] ) to change by a factor of @xmath85 , which can be compensated by adjusting each of the parameters in eq  ( [ eq : r0 ] ) except @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath86 appropriately .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.5 cm    we define a ratio @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is the star formation rate ) such that , if @xmath89 is about unity , the observed smbh to bulge mass ratio of @xmath90 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would be borne out .",
    "transformation from stellar disc(s ) to a bulge is not addressed here .",
    "it is noted , however , that stellar discs formed from multiple gas inflows of inclined angles over the lifetime of a galaxy may be conducive to bulge formation . note that @xmath88 is computed directly during the simulation , whereas the smbh accretion rate is computed in post - processing by evaluating eq  ( [ eq : mfeed ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jlow ] shows histories of @xmath84 ( blue ) and @xmath89 ( red ) for four random example galaxies .",
    "the most noticeable feature is that , without any intentional tuning , @xmath89 hovers close to unity with fluctuations of order unity .",
    "-0.0 cm -0.5 cm    figure  [ fig : ratz ] shows @xmath89 as a function of redshift .",
    "we see that @xmath89 increases with increasing redshift from @xmath91 at @xmath92 to @xmath93 at @xmath94 for galaxies with @xmath95 ( green ) , with similar trends for other mass ranges .",
    "we highlight three implications .",
    "first , the observed smbh to bulge ratio is readily achievable in a cosmological setting , with a slight tendency for more massive galaxies to have higher @xmath89 .",
    "this is due to the rationing of gas supply to the central regions of galaxies : a small amount of gas of the lowest angular momentum feeds the smbh accretion disc , while the rest builds up the stellar bulge , with the demarcation line determined by the accretion disc stability condition .",
    "note that our analysis is solely based on the angular momentum distribution of gas that has already landed in the central @xmath61kpc region .",
    "the frequency of gas inflow events into the central regions and the mass distribution of events are computed directly in our simulations .",
    "second , @xmath89 increases with increasing redshift , to within a factor of @xmath1 . the trend with redshift",
    "is expected in a cosmological context , because both the frequency and strength of galaxy interactions increase with increasing redshift , yielding overall inflow gas of lower angular momentum hence a larger @xmath96 at high redshift .",
    "third , the smoothness of @xmath89 on cosmological time scales ( @xmath97myr ) suggests that the dispersion of @xmath89 is modest , around order unity , at all redshifts , consistent with the dispersion of the observed correlation locally ( note that the comparison is made between computed @xmath98 and observed @xmath99 ) .",
    "future observations at high redshift may be able to test these predictions .",
    "although @xmath96 is relatively smooth over cosmological time scales , the gas inflow rate varies up to an order of magnitude ( figure  [ fig : jlow ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations in the inflow rate are caused by a variety of physical processes , including interactions between galaxies in close proximity , minor mergers and occasional major mergers .",
    "we have not studied in sufficient detail to ascertain whether secular processes play any major role .    -0.0 cm -0.5 cm    is smbh accretion rate directly dictated by the feeding rate from galactic scales ?",
    "figure  [ fig : duty ] shows the probability distribution of feeding rate in units of eddington rate as a function of eddington ratio .",
    "the eddington ratio is based on the assumed @xmath4 from the observed @xmath100 relation . at @xmath101",
    "where comparisons with observations may be made , the computed distribution is steeper , computed slope @xmath102 versus @xmath103 observed .",
    "this indicates that accretion onto the smbhs is  filtered \" through physical processes operating on the accretion disc .",
    "this suggests that temporal correlation between agn and star formation activities in individual galaxies below @xmath58myr is expected to be weak , in excellent agreement with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a comparison between the distribution of the feeding rate to the accretion disc ( red curve ) and that of the observed eddington ratio ( black dots ) suggests that at @xmath101 accretion discs around smbhs spend most of the time accumulating gas , at feeding rate below @xmath104 eddington ratio and that the apparent powerlaw distribution of eddington ratio may be a result of superposition of agn internal light profiles that are universal in shape ( i.e. , slope of @xmath105 ) .",
    "we see that the computed feeding rate distribution shifts to the right @xmath106dex per unit redshift , indicating that the duty cycle of luminous agns increases with redshift .",
    "we have shown that , baring implausible physical fine - tuning , neither the central massive objects - smbhs or nscs - nor the stellar bulges can be regulated by blowing away the majority of gas that has already landed , to explain the observed cmo - bulge relation .",
    "this leaves us with only one viable option .",
    "that is , the ratio of feeding rate to the nuclear region to that to the bulge is proportioned cosmologically .",
    "we test this scenario using high resolution , large - scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations without agn feedback .",
    "our analysis finds a proportionality , @xmath107 , between the feeding rate of very low angular momentum gas that can free - fall to the sub - parsec region to accrete to the smbh and the star formation rate in the galaxy .",
    "there is indication that this ratio increases with increasing redshift to within a factor of @xmath1 , suggesting that the smbh to bulge ratio is nearly redshift independent , with a modest increase with redshift .",
    "we predict that the duty cycle of luminous agns increases with redshift . while smbhs and bulges are found to coevolve on @xmath108myr time scales , there is indication that , on smaller time scales , the smbh accretion and star formation may be less or not correlated , which is likely due to variations of agn activities on smaller time scales dictated by physics of accretion disc .    while our analysis disfavor internal regulation in terms of blowing gas away with the required proportionality ,",
    " random `` internal regulation by blowing some gas away without the said proportionality is not ruled out and in fact may be common , manifested as galactic superwinds or agn winds . nor",
    "do we disfavor feedback processes that control the overall amount of cold gas supply , termed ' ' global feedback \" .",
    "global feedback reflects the collective effects of stellar evolution ( supernovae , winds , etc ) and smbh accretion ( winds , radio jets , etc ) as well as gravitational shock heating due to structure formation and photoionization heating , among others .",
    "they impact the thermodynamical state of the interstellar , circumgalactic and intergalactic medium .",
    "we emphasize that , even if global feedback controls the overall cold gas supply and its temporal distribution on cosmological time scales , it is not responsible for the proportional growth of smbhs and galaxies .",
    "an implication is that the distinction between forming a nsc or smbh may hinge on the existence of a massive enough initial black hole seed .",
    "thus , the demarcation bulge mass of @xmath14 is suggestive that only the progenitors of the massive enough galaxies have formed massive black hole seeds at some high redshift , with less massive galaxies seeded by nscs or neither .",
    "subsequently , those with initial massive black hole seeds are able to accrete the infallen gas and grow to smbhs over time , whereas those without massive black hole seeds turn the infallen gas in the nuclear regions into stars to grow the nscs .",
    "let us suppose that cmos of initial mass @xmath109 created at some high redshift in dwarf galaxies have migrated to the centers of larger galaxies to serve as central seeds .",
    "the rationed gas supply would then yield final @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for those galaxies lacking significant , subsequent growth of the cmo , i.e. , @xmath111 is not much greater than @xmath109 , the cmo - bulge mass scaling relation will be sublinear , which may explain the observed shallower scaling relation between nscs and bulges at the low end of bulge mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies with a massive initial black hole seed may form a nsc as well , consistent with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the stellar component in the vicinity of an smbh may be altered by subsequent , additional processes , such inspiral of another smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this study is related to @xcite , who studied gas accretion processes surrounding the smbh ; we explicitly avoid detailed accretion physics by focusing on the amount of mass that enters the  feeding \" zone to the smbh .",
    "this work reaches conclusions similar to that of @xcite with respect to the @xmath112 ratio , with a contrasting difference on the role of feedback .",
    "while @xcite requires that only a small fraction of the gas at subparsec scales is actually accreted by the smbh , with the rest lost to winds and outflows , we suggest that the gas disc beyond the toomre unstable radius is instead consumed by star formation , without requiring blowing away most of the gas by the smbh .",
