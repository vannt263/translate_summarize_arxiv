    "a polymer is a long , repeating chain formed through the linkage of many identical smaller molecules called monomers . understanding the behavior of a single polymeric chain passively advected by a turbulent flow is the first step in the study of polymer transport . at equilibrium a polymer molecule",

    "the polymer converges exponentially to the equilibrium shape : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the characteristic time of the slowest oscillation mode .",
    "in contrast , a non - homogeneous velocity field can stretch the polymer and elongate it .",
    "the characteristic value of velocity gradients is determined by the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath5 , which is the average logarithmic growth rate of fluid particle separations ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "in random flows the ratio of the relaxation time to the characteristic stretching one is determined by the weissenberg number @xmath6 .",

    "the feedback on the advecting flow is then modeled by an additional term in the stress tensor appearing in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the most important effect of the back reaction on the velocity field is probably the drag reduction ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "a simple description of the complex structure of polymers is provided by rouse s model , which represents a polymer as a chain of @xmath14 beads connected by hookean springs  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics can be solved by decomposing the motion of the molecule into a set of linear normal modes . a typical relaxation time is associated with the amplitude of each mode . in many physical applications",
    "the dynamics of the polymer is dominated by the fundamental mode , whose relaxation time is of the order of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the friction coefficient of the polymer and @xmath17 is the spring constant .    the elastic dumbbell model is a simplification of rouse s model .",
    "only the fundamental oscillation mode is taken into account and the elasticity of the polymer is modeled by a single spring connecting the ends of the molecule .",

    "the positions of the beads are defined by the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; the two beads represent the ends of the polymer and their separation @xmath25 determines the elongation of the molecule ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the idea of using a dumbbell to simulate a polymer dates back to kuhn  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we review the derivation of the governing equation for the bead connector ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the hydrodynamic drag force that one bead experiences due to its relative motion to the fluid is given by stokes law : @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is the velocity of the bead @xmath28 and @xmath29 the velocity of the fluid at the position of the bead$ ] , @xmath30 being the perturbation .",
    "to a first approximation we neglect this correction ( referred to as `` hydrodynamic interaction '' ) which would cause the largest relaxation time to decrease as a result of the cooperative motion among the beads  @xcite . ] .",
    "the friction coefficient is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the dynamical viscosity of the solvent .",
    "the size of the beads is assumed to be small enough for their dynamics to be influenced by thermal noise .",

    "are attenuated by the viscosity and the flow is smooth .",

    "this corresponds to considering over - damped oscillations  @xcite . ]",
    ", we finally derive from   a stochastic ordinary differential equation for the end - to - end separation of the polymer  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the relaxation time and @xmath43 has the same properties as @xmath44 and @xmath45 [ see eq .  ] .",

    "it should be noted that the infinitely extensible dumbbell is a good approximation of a polymer only when the extension of the molecule is much smaller than its maximum length @xmath12 .",
