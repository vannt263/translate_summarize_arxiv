    ", we can conclude that the line shape for both devices would be close to lorentzian in the absence of @xmath3 noise . the strongly non - lorentzian line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sa_navg100_fits ] for the co / ni device can be unambiguously attributed to @xmath3 frequency noise .",
    "although non - white frequency noise has not been directly measured in previous sto experiments , recent reports indicate it is probably an important effect in devices beyond the two types considered here .",
    "the line `` jitter '' and sa linewidth increasing with measurement time reported in mgo nanopillar stos @xcite can both be interpreted as evidence for @xmath3 frequency noise , and the authors suggest a possible mechanism for such noise that is specific to their particular devices . in other nanopillar stos containing mgo @xcite or metallic @xcite barriers ,",
    "the dft of selected short segments yielded linewidths much smaller than those found from either dft or sa measurements averaged over long times . beyond these published reports ,",
    "we and others have noticed when watching the non - averaged sa display that some devices show larger trace - to - trace jumps in center frequency than others , an observation that may be explained by varying amounts of @xmath3 noise in the devices .",
    "we measured the output of two types of stos in the time domain , using the if ouput of an sa to access signals well above 10  ghz .",
    "we presented two techniques for obtaining the power spectrum of frequency noise , @xmath52 , and showed the advantage of combining them to yield an averaged @xmath52 over a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3 noise we observed indicates that theoretical models based on thermal noise sources are insufficient for our devices over times longer than about @xmath48{\\mu s}$ ] .",
    "we also measured spectral linewidths in our devices using both an actual sa and a numerical model that allowed shorter measurement times .",
    "for the devices with the strongest @xmath3 noise , we found that sa linewidth increased , and the line shape became significantly non - lorentzian , as measurement time increased .",
    "these results imply that sa measurements of stos should be accompanied by measurement time values so that ( 1 ) comparisons can be made among various stos measured by different researchers , and ( 2 ) non - lorentzian line shapes can be correctly interpreted .",
    "although the consequences of our results for sto applications depend on the time scales involved , we expect that measurements of @xmath52 will allow more accurate predictions of performance than sa measurements alone for many applications",
    ". the detailed picture of oscillator noise provided by @xmath52 will also help in distinguishing among different physical origins for the noise .",
