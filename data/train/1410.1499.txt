    "introduction of lower dimensional gravity , soon became an interesting tool as many difficult fundamental problems of @xmath1 dimensions became much much simpler in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "it did enhance various understandings of gravity theories .",
    "though conventional realization of a black hole was first revealed in the back ground of @xmath1 dimensional space time , a lower dimensional analysis is preferred more to understand the different issues .",
    "banados , teitelboim and zanelli ( hence btz ) @xcite , in the presence of negative cosmological constant , had constructed an analytic solution representing the exterior gravitational field of a black hole in @xmath2 dimensions which was opened up the possibility of investigating many interesting features of black holes .",
    "recently , rahaman _",
    "et al _ @xcite have obtained a different kind of exact btz black hole solutions of einstein s field equations in @xmath2 dimensional anti - de sitter back ground space - time in the context of non - commutative geometry .",
    "r. b. mann and s. f. ross had investigated under what circumstances a disk of pressureless dust , actually a 3d analogue of oppenheimer - snyder collapse , will collapse to the zero angular momentum btz black hole @xcite . the properties of such type of collapse found to be the parallel process to the 4 dimensional ones .",
    "collapse to a point singularity occurs in finite proper time , and the event horizon forms in infinite coordinate time , with an infinite redshift .",
    "martins et al @xcite considering the collapse of dark energy fluids , had studied the collapse of an anisotropic fluid with zero radial pressure .",
    "irrespective of the initial fluid nature they obtained a black hole as a result(in @xmath2 dimensions ) .",
    "this was significantly different from higher dimensional phantom energy collapse @xcite .",
    "cruz and zanelli@xcite obtained an interior solution for an incompressible fluid in @xmath2 dimensions and investigated the bound on the maximum allowed mass of the resultant configuration . by assuming a particular density profile , a class of interior solutions corresponding to btz exterior was provided by cruz et al@xcite .",
    "consideration of three - dimensional perfect fluid stars in hydrostatic equilibrium(with polytropic eos ) , matched to the btz black hole exterior geometry was done by paulo m. sa .",
    "the introduction of a negative cosmological constant for stellar solutions with finite mass and finite radius , did match to an exterior black hole geometry in a way similar to the situation in four dimensions .",
    "the solution obtained by sharma et al @xcite is regular at the center and it satisfies all the physical requirements except at the boundary where the authors have proposed a thin ring of matter content with negative energy density so as to prevent collapsing .",
    "the discontinuity of the affine connections at the boundary surface provide the above matter confined to the ring .",
    "such a stress - energy tensor is not ruled out from the consideration casimir effect for massless fields .",
    "derivation of all perfect fluid solutions for the static circularly symmetric space - time was done by garcia @xcite .",
    "the general solution is presented in the standard coordinate system @xmath3 , and alternatively , in a system @xmath4 the canonical one @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "the exact analytic form of the metric potentials , in this formulation , can be obtained for any arbitrary choice of the density profile or eos of the matter content of the fluid source . in particular",
    ", they presented a solution corresponding to a static circularly symmetric perfect fluid source having constant energy density , which ( in the presence of a cosmological constant ) might be considered as analogous to the incompressible schwarzschild interior solution in @xmath6 dimensions . since determination of the exact analytic form of the solution in this formalism requires knowledge about the eos of the composition or the radial dependence of energy - density , we find it worthwhile to adopt an alternative method where the right hand side of the einstein s field equations ( @xmath7 ) will be governed by the geometry of the associated space - time ( @xmath8 )",
    "the metric for a static circularly symmetry finch and skea type star in @xmath2 dimensional spacetime can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a curvature parameter and @xmath11 hypersurface of the metric @xmath12 is parabolic in nature .",
    "+ let us assume that the energy momentum tensor for the matter distribution at the interior of the star is of the form , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15.here the vector @xmath16 is the fluid @xmath17velocity and @xmath18 is the spacelike vector which is orthogonal to @xmath16,@xmath19 is the energy density,@xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the radial and the transversal pressure of the fluid .",
    "the einstein field equation in @xmath2 dimension with cosmological constant @xmath22 for the spacetime given in equation @xmath12 together with the energy - momentum tensor given in equation @xmath23,assuming @xmath24 gives three independent equations as follows : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 let us consider the equation of state as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bag constant .",
