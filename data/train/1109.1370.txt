    "the field is effectively frozen into the cloud , and the infalling material is deflected by the field lines towards the equatorial plane .",
    "the pseudodisc contracts dynamically in the radial direction , dragging the field lines into a split monopole ( hourglass ) configuration @xcite that is consistent with observations of the polarisation of dust continuum emission in cores @xcite .",
    "the build up in magnetic pressure acts as an impediment to further collapse , however , the magnetic tension in the envelope never suffices to suspend the envelope against the gravity of the growing protostar @xcite .    within",
    "the pseudodisc ambipolar diffusion becomes important @xcite , leading to a decoupling of the magnetic field from the neutral gas , which takes place within an outwardly - propagating mhd shock @xcite .",
    "this shock ( referred to as the `` magnetic diffusion shock '' in this work ) is a continuous transition in the magnetic field and density @xcite , inwards of which the neutral material falls in at a near - free fall speed due to the reduced magnetic support .",
    "the centrifugal force becomes important and triggers the formation of a hydrodynamic shock that strongly decelerates the infalling matter and allows a keplerian disc to form @xcite .",
    "a disc wind or jet may form , launched from the inner regions of the collapse @xcite .",
    "angular momentum is removed from the pseudodisc by the twisting of magnetic field lines , which transport angular momentum from the inner parts of the core towards its outer regions @xcite . the amount of magnetic braking affecting the collapse , and hence the existence and sign of the keplerian protostellar disc , is determined by the coupling of the field to the charged particles and the drift of these against the neutral component in response to the electric field in the neutral rest frame .",
    "the lorentz force is transmitted to the neutral gas through the drag forces caused by collisions between the neutral and charged particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of star formation typically approximate the magnetic field behaviour by ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( imhd ) , where the mass - to - flux ratio is held constant and the magnetic field is regarded as being frozen into the neutral medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this situation the magnetic field and the particles move together in the collapsing flow , however this simplification only truly applies in the outermost regions of gravitational collapse where the density is low . if imhd were to hold true throughout the collapse the magnetic flux in the star would be @xmath3@xmath4 times larger than that observed in young stars ( this is the  magnetic flux problem  , described in",
    "* ) .    as the density in the core increases flux freezing breaks down , and the relative drifts of different charged species with respect to the neutral particles delineate three magnetic diffusivity regimes :    the _ ohmic ( resistive ) diffusion _ limit , which dominates in high density regions where the ionisation fraction is low .",
    "the ions and the electrons frequently collide with the neutrals over the electron gyration period , and the magnetic field is decoupled from all charged particles .",
    "ohmic diffusion is important in the innermost regions of the protostellar disc where the density and collisional rates are high ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the _ ambipolar diffusion _ limit , which dominates in regions of relatively low density where the fractional ionisation is high , causing the ionised component to drift with the field through the neutrals .",
    "ambipolar diffusion is dominant in molecular clouds @xcite , in protostellar discs at radial distances beyond @xmath5 au and close to the surface of these discs nearer to the protostar @xcite .",
    "the _ hall diffusion _ limit , which dominates in the intermediate regimes between ambipolar and ohmic diffusion .",
    "the more massive particles such as ions and charged dust grains are decoupled from the magnetic field and are instead collisionally - coupled to the neutral gas .",
    "hall diffusion is expected to dominate in many regions of molecular clouds as they undergo gravitational collapse @xcite , and in protostellar discs @xcite .    in the hall limit",
    "the magnetic response of the disc is not invariant under a global reversal of the magnetic field @xcite as hall diffusion twists the field and changes the angular momentum of the neutral fluid ; in a rotationally - supported disc this causes the gas to fall inwards if it loses angular momentum , or outwards if it gains it .",
    "ambipolar and ohmic diffusion , however , always cause the field to move in the radial direction against the flow of the neutrals  reversing the direction of the field does not affect the direction of the field diffusion .",
    "the actual magnitude and type of coupling that occurs between the fluid and magnetic field in molecular clouds and protostellar discs is uncertain due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed observations in these regions , particularly of the magnetic field .",
    "calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and resistivity by @xcite suggested that hall diffusion is important and may dominate the magnetic field behaviour at many of the densities and field strengths encountered in molecular clouds and protostellar discs .",
    "in particular , the hall term is significant for molecular gas densities in the range @xmath6@xmath7 @xmath8 ( when @xmath9 scales as @xmath10 ) , although the presence and distribution of grains complicates the calculation of the diffusivities @xcite .    in simulations of star formation where the magnetic field behaviour is not governed by imhd",

    "it seems likely that star formation requires all of these processes to some degree , however it is only recently that simulations have been performed with more than one of these processes included @xcite , and hall diffusion is almost always overlooked .",
    "the nature of the coupling determines the magnetic field direction as the field lines emerge from the surface of the protostellar disc , which in turn controls the amount of material that is able to slide along the field lines and be flung outwards from the surface in disc - driven wind models @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct a semianalytic model of gravitational collapse in order to demonstrate the importance of hall diffusion and its influence on the magnetic braking catastrophe , in which the magnetic braking affecting a collapsing flow is such that all angular momentum is removed from the flow and no keplerian disc may form .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we describe the formulation of the self - similar collapse equations , the assumptions governing this approximation and the boundary conditions of the core ; the numerical procedures are outlined in  3 ; in  4 we present the similarity solutions ; the effect of the hall term on the solutions and the magnetic braking catastrophe is discussed in  5 and our conclusions are stated in  6 .",
    "the goal of this work is to construct a semianalytic model of gravitational collapse similar to that of kk02 , including terms for hall diffusion in the equations for the magnetic field diffusion and braking .",
    "this allows the calculation of similarity solutions that show the importance of hall diffusion in molecular cloud cores and collapsing flows , as well as comparisons between the influence of the hall and ambipolar diffusion terms .",

    "we assume that the collapse is axisymmetric to simplify the calculations , and the magnetic field is taken to be aligned with the axis of rotation .",
    "this is in contrast with some observations of protostellar systems such as the binary ngc 1333 iras 4a where the axis normal to the binary envelope lies between the outflow and magnetic field axes @xcite , however most observations seem to show that the magnetic field takes on an hourglass shape that is aligned with the axis of rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is expected that isothermality shall break down in the innermost regions of our solutions , however , as thermal stresses do not play a significant role in the larger - scale dynamics isothermality is not expected to introduce large errors into the calculations .    the disc is assumed to be thin based upon the results of mouschovias and collaborators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this assumption allows us to further reduce the dimensionality of the problem by vertically - averaging the variables over the scale height of the disc , although it implies that processes that depend on variations in the density or the magnetic field with height within the disc can not be included in the collapse calculations .",
    "effects such as turbulence or the interaction between active and dead zones in the disc are not expected to have a large effect on the overall dynamics of early collapse ( although they are known to become important in some regions of protostellar discs once the adiabatic core and protostar have formed ) and their exclusion is necessary to the self - similarity of the solutions .    the vertical averaging is performed as in kk02 . as",

    ".    the surface density of the pseudodisc is defined by the expression @xmath52 assuming that the density is constant with height within the disc , and the specific angular momentum is defined by @xmath53 .",
    "we neglect any mass loss due to a disc wind .",
    "the radial components of gravity and the magnetic field are calculated using the monopole expressions @xmath54 and @xmath55 where the enclosed mass @xmath56 when the central mass dominates and @xmath57 is the magnetic flux enclosed within the radius @xmath58 .",
    "these simplifications were also used by kk02 , as @xcite found that these expressions give values of the gravitational force and magnetic field that are near enough to those found using an iterative method that they do not introduce significant errors into the calculation .",
    "the vertical angular momentum transport above and within the disc is achieved by magnetic braking , especially during the dynamic collapse phase inwards of the magnetic diffusion shock and in the rotationally - supported inner disc .",

    "integrating in the inwards direction is more problematic as the calculation is very sensitive both to the values of the variables at @xmath143 and the hall diffusion parameter .",
    "integrating inwards is complicated by the presence of shock discontinuities and sonic points , which must be calculated explicitly .",
    "close to the magnetic diffusion shock there may occur a subshock in which the supersonic ( but slowing due to the sudden increase in @xmath152 ) inflow is abruptly slowed to a subsonic rate .",
    "this only occurs when the hall parameter is positive , and is likely caused by the changed magnetic braking triggered by the azimuthal field growth during the shock .",

    "the incorrect estimate is then assigned to be the new boundary of the shock position as appropriate , and a new estimate of @xmath184 is chosen at the midpoint between the boundaries . as the position of the shock is more precisely known , the variables follow the asymptotic behaviour longer",

    "the variables are integrated inwards from the centrifugal shock and if @xmath101 is large enough they are manually integrated through the sonic point that presages the existence of a centrifugal subshock . after the sonic point ,",
    "the binary search is employed again to find the position of its associated shock front , as the behaviour of the variables downstream of the subshock is unchanged . in this instance",
    "the initial upper boundary of the search ( @xmath188 ) is the sonic point , and the lower boundary is @xmath189 .",
    "if @xmath101 is so large that multiple subshocks exist then this behaviour repeats , with the first subshock followed by an additional sonic point and then a second subshock ; the increasing number of subshocks cause the calculation to become so unstable that it is unable to converge on the true similarity solution .",
    "note that even when the shock positions are known `` precisely '' , the routine is often unable to complete the integration all the way to the inner boundary .",

    "the enhanced magnetic squeezing during the shock front would be unable to reduce the disc thickness so dramatically over the fluid transit time through the shock , which implies that the thinness of the compressed region is a numerical artefact .",

    "kk02 also derived jump conditions for use when the magnetic forces are important ; these are not required in this work .",
    "it is possible that as the positive hall parameter becomes larger the magnetic diffusion subshock may require different jump conditions that take the twisting of the magnetic field lines due to the hall effect into account .",
    "the magnetic field strength does not change in the centrifugal shock front as the magnetic pressure and tension terms are not large enough to change the field behaviour . in the post - shock region",
    "the field increases as the other variables settle to the asymptotic behaviour in  [ innerbc ] . while the magnetic field is unchanged by the passage of the shock , its position and strength depend upon the hall parameter .",
    "the increased magnetic diffusion can also cause the formation of subshocks  rings of sharply - enhanced density in the post - shock region  as the outward - moving flux causes the infalling gas to be slowed .    as with the magnetic diffusion subshock ,",
    "the centrifugal subshocks are preceded by a sonic point that must be calculated manually and the subshock position is found using the binary search above .",
    "inwards of the centrifugal shocks the variables approach the asymptotic behaviour with some overshoots and corrections .      in the innermost regions of the collapse the derivatives @xmath198 and @xmath199 become very large in comparison to the other derivatives",
    ". these can correspondingly cause small numerical errors in the calculation of these derivatives and their integrals to build and trigger the appearance of a spontaneous singularity where the variables diverge dramatically from the asymptotic solution ( discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "this behaviour is avoided by replacing the full mhd equations with a simplified set that can be integrated all the way to the inner boundary : the problematic derivatives are replaced by approximations derived from the expected asymptotic behaviour , that is , @xmath200 these are then substituted into the other equations so that @xmath149 , @xmath152 , @xmath170 and @xmath192 are found by solving equations [ sscrm ] , [ ssvhe ] , [ ssin ] and [ ssb_phis ] simultaneously , while the remaining equations are integrated to the boundary .",
    "switching between the full and simplified models occurs after the minimum in the surface density as the variables follow the asymptotic solution , but before they diverge from the expected behaviour .",
    "typically this occurs when the old and new values of @xmath149 match to within 0.01/@xmath85 ( @xmath201 per cent of the original value ) and @xmath198 calculated using both methods matches less well to around 200/@xmath85 ( @xmath202 per cent ) .",
    "when the precision of the match is as high as possible the change between the two equation sets is smooth ; the required precision of the match is raised when the switch is apparent as this clearly influences the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "the simplified set of equations is not subject to the same numerical instabilities as the full set unless the guess at the matching point is particularly poor .",
    "should such a guess be adopted then the routine is unable to match onto the simplified model , and the failure of the inwards integration is used to refine the values at the matching point .",
    "the integration is continued to the inner boundary ( typically at @xmath203 ) where the variables are compared to the inner conditions given by equations [ in - m ] and [ in - psi ] .",
    "the differences between the expected and integrated variables are passed back to the shooting routine , which modifies the values at @xmath143 and begins the next iteration .",

    "the density is much lower than in previous solutions , and the disc grows at a slower rate .",
    "the similarity solutions span many orders of magnitude in both radius and density , and the inclusion of a hall parameter that is 20 per cent that of the ambipolar diffusion parameter has a large effect on the behaviour of the magnetic field . in the intermediate region between the magnetic diffusion shock ( at @xmath217 au in fig .",
    "[ fig - comp ] ) and the centrifugal shock ( @xmath218 au ) , the azimuthal field tension causes the hall drift to enhance the radial diffusion of the field lines when @xmath101 is negative .",
    "the magnetic diffusion shock occurs earlier in the collapse and is less dynamic than in the other solutions , as much of the field has already been decoupled from the fluid .",
    "however , when @xmath101 is positive then hall diffusion acts to reduce the net radial diffusion , resulting in magnetic walls and subshocks that disrupt the flow .",
    "the magnetic field carried inwards increases , and the magnetic pressure and tension terms remain important throughout the collapse .",
    "any twist in the field lines causes an increase in the magnetic pressure gradient , so that the net amount of radial diffusion drops off as the magnetic braking slows the rotation .",
    "there is a similar duality to the azimuthal field drift .",
    "again looking at the region between the two shocks , when @xmath101 is negative hall drift occurs in the azimuthal direction , twisting up the field lines in the pseudodisc and creating a leading torque on the neutral rotation .",
    "the reduced value of @xmath211 causes the azimuthal field component to reach its capped value @xmath219 sooner , and the magnetic braking , which depends upon @xmath220 , is also reduced .",
    "because of this less angular momentum is removed from the pseudodisc , causing the centrifugal force to become dynamically important earlier and a larger rotationally - supported disc to form .    in the other orientation when @xmath101 is positive , hall and ambipolar diffusion act together to untwist the field lines in the pseudodisc . in these similarity solutions",
    "@xmath211 is larger , and so while it takes longer for @xmath51 to achieve its capped value there is more magnetic braking and the angular momentum is further reduced .",
    "a smaller keplerian disc forms due to the reduced centrifugal force , and both shocks have subshocks where the magnetic forces alter the radial velocity of the fluid .",
    "downstream of the magnetic diffusion shock the radial magnetic pressure gradient slows the fluid in the radial and azimuthal directions , while downstream of the centrifugal shock the gas is accelerated inward as the increase in @xmath211 causes a burst of magnetic braking that disrupts the disc and causes the formation of a subshock .    while the angular momentum behaviour between the shocks is changed by the inclusion of hall diffusion , the cap on @xmath51 acts to ensure that the angular momentum in the inner disc is that expected for a keplerian disc .",
    "the cap , while physically motivated , replaces unspecified disc physics such as reconnection , a disc wind , or turbulence , which would act to prevent the azimuthal field component from greatly exceeding the vertical component ; and the magnitude at which it ought to act to limit @xmath51 is uncertain .",
    "it is also unclear if such limiting of the azimuthal field component happens in real collapsing cores , as numerical simulations do demonstrate tightly - wound magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "the azimuthal field cap limits the similarity solution set explored to those in which discs form , however despite this hall diffusion has been shown to restrict disc formation in collapse without counter - rotation if the hall diffusion is too strong in comparison to ambipolar diffusion and @xmath101 has the `` wrong '' sign .",

    "it has recently been argued that there exists a handedness to observations of transverse gradients in the faraday rotation measure across the base of jets associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of sources in which it was possible to determine the transverse gradients were found to have clockwise gradients , implying that the outflow has a helical magnetic field with a preferred magnetic polarity .",
    "one explanation of this behaviour is that the hall effect is important in the inner accretion disc , acting to form a jet when the field has a positive magnetic polarity , and to suppress jet formation when the polarity is negative @xcite .",
    "this explanation fits the limited available data well , although it must be confirmed by future observations at higher resolutions and sensitivities .",
    "similarly , it may be possible to show the importance of the sign of the hall parameter observationally by measuring the polarisation of the magnetic field with respect to the axis of rotation in zeeman observations of newly - forming stars and their discs . should larger discs and lower accretion rates be correlated with a particular field orientation then the hall effect will have been shown to affect the collapse process .",
    "alma ( among other next - generation instruments ) shall be capable of imaging nearby dense prestellar cores and their envelopes in both dust and molecular line emission , and could also be used to observe polarised dust emission and map the magnetic field in cores .",
    "such observations could be sensitive enough to observe if there is any difference in the field alignment between protostellar discs and their envelopes , and whether there is any correlation between disc size and the direction of rotation in the disc .",
    "none of the solutions calculated the effects of very weak magnetic diffusion or strong magnetic braking on the core .",
    "in numerical simulations with such conditions the magnetic braking removes all of the angular momentum from the fluid , preventing the formation of a rotationally - supported disc  this behaviour has been dubbed the `` magnetic braking catastrophe '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "disc formation was assured in this work by the cap placed upon @xmath51 , which limits the twisting of the field lines , however kk02 were able to demonstrate the magnetic braking catastrophe by adopting a large @xmath60 .",
    "hall diffusion is capable of inducing spin in an initially - nonrotating fluid @xcite , and could resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe in solutions with strong braking by spinning up the core in the opposite direction once magnetic braking has removed the initial angular momentum .",
    "hall - induced spin - up of an initially - nonrotating core was demonstrated by @xcite , although the formation of a keplerian disc required a larger hall parameter than that expected from the microphysics , possibly because the 10 au sink particle prevented the outwards growth of a disc from the geometric centre of the collapse .",
    "further work must be done to study the role of the hall effect on the magnetic field diffusion in star formation , particularly using the semianalytic model constructed in this work .",
    "this could include adopting more realistic values and scalings of the ambipolar and hall diffusion parameters , in order to resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe ; including a disc wind in place of the cap on @xmath51 ; and exploring those regions of parameter space in which hall diffusion is the dominant form of field transport .    as explained in ",
    "[ ssim ] , the hall and ambipolar diffusion coefficients in our calculations scale with the nondimensional variables in the same manner . however , the diffusion coefficients could scale as any function of @xmath85 and the self - similar variables in order to mimic the behaviour expected from ionisation equilibrium calculations .",
    "for example , the hall parameter could scale as @xmath234 which is expected if the only particles in the collapsing core are neutrals and ions , without grains .",
    "such a formulation would cause hall diffusion to become important earlier in the collapse , and the keplerian disc would need to be described by a new set of asymptotic inner boundary conditions .",
    "the inner keplerian disc in our solutions satisfies the criterion @xmath235 , which is the launching condition for a cold , centrifugally - driven wind , and the radial scaling of the magnetic field components is identical to that of the radially - self - similar wind solution of @xcite .",
    "such a disc wind ( described in appendix c of kk02 ) would be the dominant mechanism for the vertical transfer of angular momentum from the disc to the envelope , and must be included in future self - similar collapse simulations in order to explore the influence a wind may have on the angular momentum transport and the magnetic braking catastrophe , and to improve the accuracy of the semianalytic models , as disc winds and jets occur in numerical simulations of collapsing cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which display the magnetic braking catastrophe .",
    "further explorations of parameter space are required to more fully understand the influence of the hall effect on star and keplerian disc formation .",
    "in particular we have yet to fully separate the influence of hall diffusion from that of increased ambipolar diffusion in the core , to find similarity solutions in which hall diffusion is the dominant form of flux transport , or solutions in which there is no ambipolar diffusion at all . as in @xcite ,",
    "solutions with only hall diffusion see the field diffusion depend upon the @xmath236 terms , so the radial diffusion is controlled by the azimuthal field component ( which may be capped ) , and the azimuthal diffusion depends upon the radial component .",
    "additional work should also be done to confirm that larger discs form in hall similarity solutions where the core is initially rapidly - rotating .",
    "this paper described a semianalytic self - similar model of the gravitational collapse of rotating magnetic molecular cloud cores with both hall and ambipolar diffusion , presenting similarity solutions that showed that the hall effect has a profound influence on the dynamics of collapse .",
    "the solutions satisfied the vertically - averaged self - similar equations for mhd collapse under the assumptions of axisymmetry and isothermality , matching onto self - similar power law relations describing an isothermal core at the moment of point mass formation on the outer boundary and a keplerian disc on the inner boundary .",
    "the inner solution describes a keplerian disc in which accretion through the disc depends upon the magnetic diffusion ; with an appropriate value of the nondimensional hall diffusion parameter @xmath101 a stable rotationally - supported disc forms in which the surface density @xmath237 scales as @xmath238 and vertical field strength @xmath239 .",
    "these are the scalings expected from other simulations of protostellar discs to which the solutions calculated in this work compare favourably .",
    "no disc may form in solutions without counter - rotation when the hall parameter is large ( in comparison to the ambipolar diffusion parameter ) and has the wrong sign ( which indicates the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the axis of rotation ) , as the diffusion in these solutions is too strong and causes disruptive torques that form subshocks in the similarity solutions .",
    "this behaviour occurs because the response of the fluid to hall diffusion is not invariant under a global reversal of the magnetic field .",
    "the size of the rotationally - supported disc in the full similarity solutions was shown to vary with the amount of hall and ambipolar diffusion affecting the pseudodisc through their effect on the magnetic braking in the fluid . by creating an additional torque on the disc ,",
    "hall diffusion can either increase or decrease the angular momentum and rotational support in the infalling fluid , leading to an order of magnitude change in the keplerian disc radius between the similarity solutions at the extremes of @xmath240 ( where the ambipolar diffusion parameter , @xmath241 ) .",
    "a small amount of hall diffusion was shown have a large effect on the solution because the dynamic range of collapse is itself many orders of magnitude in space and time .",
    "hall diffusion causes there to be a preferred handedness to the field alignment and the direction of rotation in forming a large keplerian disc that could be observed using next - generation instruments such as alma .    the accretion rate onto the central point mass",
    "is similarly influenced by hall diffusion .",
    "this is a smaller effect than that on the disc radius , as between @xmath242 ( again with @xmath241 ) the accretion rate onto the protostar only changes by 6 per cent , or @xmath243 m@xmath118 yr@xmath38 . there exists a clear trend in which the protostellar accretion rate drops off with increasingly negative hall parameter despite the constant accretion onto the core , as the reduced magnetic braking in these solutions causes a larger keplerian disc to form , and accretion through this disc onto the protostar is slow .",
    "the magnetic braking catastrophe could be resolved by the inclusion of hall diffusion in numerical solutions , as with one sign of @xmath101 the hall effect acts to reduce the total amount of braking affecting the core , preventing it from removing too much angular momentum from the collapse . however , with the other sign of @xmath101 the magnetic braking is increased so that more angular momentum is transported to the envelope . as magnetic braking due to hall diffusion",
    "does not stop acting once no angular momentum remains ( as ambipolar diffusion does ) it could also then spin the collapsing fluid back up in the opposite direction to the initial rotation .",
    "this acceleration is only possible with hall diffusion , and it has the potential to completely resolve the magnetic braking catastrophe .    because of its tendency to move the magnetic field in unusual directions hall diffusion",
    "is usually overlooked in simulations of gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "it has been shown that the hall effect is important to the dynamics of the collapse , particularly the magnetic braking behaviour which determines the existence and size of the rotationally - supported protostellar disc .",

    "this angular momentum must be removed from the disc at a rate equal to @xmath280 which gives a torque on the disc @xmath281 the amount of flux remains constant along flux tubes , so that the flux through the disc inside of a radius @xmath58 is equal to the amount of flux through the cylindrical external cloud inside of the radius @xmath282 : @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the value of @xmath211 at the midplane of the disc .",

    "it is clear that the properties of the external medium determine the conditions at the disc surface .",
