    "since fujisaka and yamada s 1983 paper on synchronized motion in coupled chaotic systems many researchers have discussed the stability of this type of motion  @xcite . rather than attempt to reference a complete list of papers on this topic",
    "we refer the interested reader to refs .",
    "( these papers have extensive bibliographies and represent a reasonable introduction to the literature . )",
    "the discussion in this paper will center around the type of synchronization discussed by most of these authors .",
    "namely , two or more _ identical _ chaotic systems , coupled in a drive / response manner , which exhibit motion that is chaotic and _ identical _ in time .",
    "( although the dynamical systems we examine are chaotic our results are applicable to nonlinear systems that exhibit other types of motion . )",
    "the central question addressed in this paper is : `` given two arbitrary identical dynamical systems how can one _ design _ a physically available coupling scheme that is guaranteed to produce stable synchronized motion . '' despite the large amount of effort devoted to this issue there are relatively few rigorous results . in most cases rigorous results are obtained using lyapunov functions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this method is not regular since , in practice , it can only be applied to particular examples .",
    "i.e. , given an arbitrary dynamical system it is not clear how one can derive a coupling scheme and/or a lyapunov function which guarantees stable synchronous motion .",
    "another rigorous approach is that of ashwin et .",
    "al .  @xcite . in a series of papers they presented results that are related to the central question . in their work",
    "the measure ( equivalently , the trajectory ) used to describe the dynamics of the system is of central importance . to apply the approach",
    "one must show that all normal lyapunov exponents are negative for all measures of the dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , it is well known that lyapunov exponents can be difficult to calculate .",
    "non - rigorous results that employ lyapunov exponents to determine the stability of measures to perturbations have also appeared in the literature  @xcite .",
    "a third rigorous approach by walker and mees has recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "they uses the method of lyapunov to develop a sufficient condition for stable synchronization .",
    "their condition relates eigenvalues of the linear part of the vector field to the jacobian of the nonlinear part .",
    "the analysis in this paper also d differs from that in other papers in that they interpret synchronization as an observer problem .    finally , there are a few special cases where , due to the coupling between the nonlinear systems , rigorous analysis of the stability of synchronization is straightforward .",
    "one case is when the coupling transforms the driven system into a stable homogeneous linear system with time dependent external forcing , ( see ref .",
    "a second is when the coupling between all of the variables is diagonal  @xcite .",
    "in many practical cases these types of coupling ca nt be achieved .",
    "the approach advocated in this paper is like that of ashwin  et .",
    "al . in that it emphasizes the role of individual trajectories within the dynamics of the system .",
    "however , we do not explicitly use lyapunov exponents or lyapunov functions to examine the linear stability of synchronous motion .",
    "it is also like the paper by walker and mees in that their stability condition and design concepts are similar the one we develop below .",
    "the issue of design has also been addressed by peng  et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "we have two major results .",
    "the first is a rigorously derived criterion which , if satisfied , _ guarantees _ that the coupling scheme will yield linearly stable synchronous motion on the driving trajectory . the second result is a simple , `` quick and dirty '' criterion that can be used to estimate the coupling strength needed for linear stability .",
    "this second criterion is easy to implement and can be used to quickly examine a large range of coupling schemes and strengths . for both cases ,",
    "linear stability is with respect to perturbations that are transverse to the synchronization manifold .",
    "( of course , because our results are obtained from a linearization they can not fully address the complications that arise when nonlinear effects are incorporated .",
    "some of these difficulties are discussed in section  [ sum ] . )",
    "references  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the results presented below , indicate that the stability of the synchronization manifold depends on the measure used to describe the dynamics on the manifold .",
    "if the synchronization manifold contains a set of chaotic trajectories then there are an infinite number of possible measures for the dynamics on the manifold . under these circumstances a practical answer to the question of the stability of the synchronization manifold can be quite complicated .",
    "for example , the manifold may be linearly unstable when one uses a measure confined to one periodic orbit on the manifold ( a dirac measure  @xcite ) and linearly stable on a measure confined to a different periodic orbit . at the end of the next section we discuss relevant results that may allow one to overcome this difficulty .",
    "we close this section with an outline of the remainder of this paper . in sections  [ theory1 ] and [ theory2 ]",
    "we derive criteria that indicate when synchronization between drive and response systems will occur .",
    "the results in section  [ theory1 ] are rigorous while those in section  [ theory2 ] are approximations .",
    "section  [ results ] presents results from analytic examinations and numerical experiments we have conducted on the rossler , lorenz , and ott  sommerer systems . in section  [ sum ] we summarize our results and discuss how nonlinear effects impact our results . in appendix",
    "[ other ] we discus how our results apply to other systems ( in this appendix we examine a system of equations that come about when considering chaotic masking for private communications ) . in appendix",
    "[ geometry1 ] and we present geometric interpretations of the manifolds that arise in our discussion , while in appendix  [ geometry2 ] we discuss a geometrical interpretation of the theoretical results . in appendix  [ control ]",
    "we discuss the relationship between our results and control theory , while appendix  [ lorenz ] is devoted to an alternative analysis of our criterion and an additional examination of the lorenz system .",
    "this section presents rigorous results regarding linear stability of trajectories on the invariant manifold associated with synchronous motion .",
    "( here , and for the remainder of this paper , when we say synchronization to a trajectory is linearly stable we mean it is linearly stable with respect to perturbations that are transverse to the part of the synchronization manifold defined by the driving trajectory . )",
    "the major result is a criterion which , if satisfied , guarantees linear stability of the driving trajectory within the synchronization manifold . the criterion can be used to design couplings that guarantee linearly stable synchronization .",
    "we will explicitly examine one type of drive / response coupling for identical systems that have chaotic uncoupled dynamics  @xcite .",
    "assume the dynamics of the driving system is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 . in the presence of coupling the dynamics of the response system becomes @xmath2 where  is a vector function of its argument and represents coupling between the systems .",
    "we assume @xmath3 , hence synchronization occurs on the invariant manifold given by @xmath4 .",
    "obviously , if the coupling strength is below some critical threshold then synchronization will not occur .",
    "in addition , for some s and choices of , synchronous motion only occurs within some finite range of coupling strengths . for these situations",
    "if the coupling strength is too small _ or _ too large then synchronization will not occur . finally , for some s and choices of  synchronization will never occur .    since we are interested in deviations of  from  we use eqs .",

    ", synchronous motion is stable on all possible driving trajectories ) notice that the right hand side of eq .",

    "( [ cond3 ] ) , is a `` quick and dirty '' criterion for estimating the coupling strengths need to produce synchronous behavior .",

    "both the rigorous and approximate condition are dependent on the measure used for the driving dynamics and can yield different stability results for different driving trajectories . nonetheless , based on our numerical results , and previous work by others",

    "these examples provide a thorough examination of the stability criterion we propose .",
    "we close with a discussion of how noise and nonlinear effects influence the conclusions one can draw from the linear stability analysis . in this context consider a chaotic attractor that contains an unstable fixed point at @xmath151 .",

    "a linear stability analysis does not take into account the existence of the unstable trajectories for @xmath217 .",
    "for arbitrarily small noise amplitude there exists a range of @xmath91 values near @xmath81 where noise will eventually push the response system above or below the dashed lines .",
    "when this occurs the response system can not collapse back to the synchronized state and is force to seek out an attracting state away from the synchronization manifold .",

    "if the real @xmath256 has a continuous derivative ( in fact we believe @xmath256 is smooth ) then there exists an open neighborhood of @xmath237 where the rigorous condition for synchronization ( eq .  ( [ cond2 ] ) ) is guaranteed to be satisfied .",
    "the existence of this neighborhood is important because , although the synchronization manifold is linearly stable for @xmath237 this does not guarantee that @xmath237 results in the _ most _ stable manifold .",
    "because the loss of synchronization is unfavorable for applications involving communications one wants a synchronization manifold that is as stable as possible , and which recaptures the response trajectory as soon as possible in the event that synchronization is lost .",
    "therefore , one should to use an @xmath91 value that yields the _ most stable _ synchronization manifold .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.lyap ] we show the transverse lyapunov exponents as a function of @xmath91 for our model .",
    "the figure indicates that , at least as far as transverse lyapunov exponents are concerned , the most stable synchronization manifold occurs when @xmath272 .",
    "the fact that the rigorous condition is guaranteed to be satisfied in some neighborhood of @xmath237 means that we are free to search for values of @xmath91 that result in the most stable synchronization manifold .",
    "in this appendix we discusses the various invariant manifolds that arise when discussing synchronization .",
    "the idea of an invariant manifold is fundamental to our approach . because we have discussed many different invariant manifolds it is useful to carefully construct a geometric picture of these manifolds .",
    "this construction provides a unified interpretation of the issues discussed above .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the trajectory of the driving system and let @xmath273 denote the trajectory of the response system .",
    "hence , the full phase space that describes the evolution of the two systems is @xmath274 .",
    "if  denotes a trajectory in the full phase space , then the synchronization manifold for identical systems is defined by @xmath275 .",
    "next , assume that the driving trajectory evolves on an @xmath276  dimensional invariant manifold , @xmath277 .",
    "this manifold may , or may not , be stable to perturbations .",
    "for example , if the driving trajectory is an unstable fixed point then @xmath278 , and @xmath277 is unstable .",
    "if the driving trajectory is an unstable limit cycle then @xmath279 , and @xmath280 is unstable .",
    "however , if the driving trajectory is a dense orbit on a chaotic attractor then @xmath276 and @xmath277 is stable .",
    "( for this case we are not saying that @xmath277 is the attractor .",
    "rather , @xmath277 is the manifold that contains the attractor . ) for all of these cases it is possible for @xmath277 to occupy zero volume in @xmath281 . finally , if the system is hamiltonian and the driving trajectory is chaotic then @xmath282 and @xmath277 occupies positive volume in @xmath281 .",
    "in addition , the dynamical system itself may have an invariant manifold , @xmath283 ( which we call an invariant manifold of the system . )",
    "an invariant manifold of the system may contain an infinite number of trajectories .",
    "for example , the ott ",
    "sommerer system discussed above has an invariant manifold defined by @xmath158 , and a chaotic attractor exists in this manifold  @xcite .",
    "( this chaotic set is attracting for points within the manifold defined by @xmath158 . )",
    "therefore , it is possible to consider a case where @xmath277 is restricted to an invariant manifold of the system , @xmath284 .",
    "however , in general this is not the case .",
    "an important point to keep in mind is that the driving trajectory defines @xmath277 , and each different driving trajectory ( in general ) defines a different @xmath277 .    for identical systems ,",
    "the response system has an identical @xmath249  dimensional manifold , @xmath285 .",
    "the manifolds @xmath277 and @xmath285 are not the same because @xmath277 lives in the phase space of the driving system while @xmath285 lives in the phase space of the response system .    in the full phase space of the combined system these manifolds can be defined by @xmath286 , and @xmath287 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig.manifolds ] for a schematic picture of these manifolds . ) these manifolds intersect in the full phase space .",
    "the intersection is defined by @xmath288 , ( see the dark solid curve in fig .  [ fig.manifolds ] ) . since",
    "this definition does not require @xmath232 it is clear that , although @xmath289 contains part of the synchronization manifold , @xmath290 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath291 contains all possible driving trajectories .",
    "therefore , if @xmath277 is restricted to an invariant manifold of the system ( @xmath284 ) then some trajectories within @xmath291 are not in @xmath292 .    therefore , when we discuss the linear stability of synchronization _ for a given driving trajectory _",
    "we are actually discussing the stability of the manifold given by @xmath293 to perturbations that are transverse to this manifold .",
    "the manifold associated with this intersection is labeled @xmath294 in fig  [ fig.manifolds ] .",
    "although it is shown as a dot one must keep in mind that the dimension of the manifold , @xmath295 , ranges from a low of zero to a high of @xmath296 . if @xmath297 is stable for all possible driving trajectories we say that @xmath291 is stable .",
    "in this appendix we discuss a geometrical interpretation of the stability criteria discussed in sections  [ theory1 ] and [ theory2 ] . equations  ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) have geometrical interpretations which can be used to _ design _ couplings that yield stable synchronous motion .",
    "one can think of the elements of @xmath9 as living in a @xmath298  dimensional parameter space .",
    "the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) defines a function in this parameter space .",
    "furthermore , this function can be used to define a family of surfaces in this parameter space .",

    "\\right\\rangle = c_{\\bf b}$ ] , where @xmath301 is a constant . in a similar fashion",
    "the left has side defines a different function and family of surfaces .",
    "explicitly , the family of surfaces @xmath302 is defined by @xmath184 = c_\\lambda$ ] , where @xmath303 is a constant .",
    "now consider a fixed driving trajectory .",
    "for this trajectory , each value of @xmath301 ( @xmath303 ) corresponds to a particular surface from the family @xmath304 ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "the boundary of the region of parameter space that yields linearly stable synchronization is given by the intersections of surfaces from @xmath302 with surfaces from @xmath304 where @xmath305 .",
    "these intersections form a surface in the parameter space .",
    "any intersection associated with @xmath306 will result in linearly stable synchronization onto the driving trajectory .",
    "furthermore , all of these intersections will reside on one side of the surface defined by the boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.surfaces ] ) . because @xmath303 and @xmath301 are ( in general ) arbitrary real numbers , and the reals are dense , we know that the region associated with linearly stable synchronization will typically occupy positive volume in the phase space .",
    "an immediate consequence of this approach is that if none of the surfaces from @xmath302 intersect surfaces from @xmath304 then the rigorous criterion for synchronization can not be met .",
    "an explicit examples of this analysis is the ott ",
    "sommerer example discussed above .",
    "for this example eqs .",
    "( [ cond4 ] ) and ( [ def_c ] ) are equivalent to the stability criterion of eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "begin with the diagonal driving example and consider a fixed driving trajectory .",
    "for this example the parameter space is  and @xmath33 ( from eq .",
    "( [ def_c ] ) ) is a constant , independent of @xmath91 . because @xmath33 is constant",
    ", @xmath301 can have only one value and there is only one surface in the family @xmath304 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the right right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cond4 ] ) is independent of @xmath91 implies that @xmath304 , is the entire parameter space .",
    "in contrast @xmath303 can take on any value .",
    "the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cond4 ] ) indicates that a particular value of @xmath303 corresponding to a particular value of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , @xmath302 is a family of points in the parameter space .    for these surfaces",
    "the boundary of the region of parameter space that yields linearly stable synchronization ( the intersection of @xmath302 and @xmath304 associated with @xmath307 ) is a point in .",
    "intersections associated with @xmath306 are also points . finally , the region associated with linearly stable synchronization ( the intersection of all surfaces from @xmath302 with surfaces from @xmath304 such that @xmath306 ) is an interval which occupies positive volume in  ( see eq .",
    "( [ test_1 ] ) ) .",
    "the final example is driving with position , and the position is permitted to drive both the position and velocity equations .",
    "the parameter space for this example is @xmath205 .",
    "now , assume the driving trajectory is fixed .",
    "the derivation that lead to eq .",
    "( [ test_3 ] ) shows that , @xmath304 is a family of parabolas in @xmath205 .",
    "selecting a value for @xmath301 is equivalent to selecting a value for @xmath33 , which is equivalent to selecting a particular parabola from this family .",
    "the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cond4 ] ) indicates that @xmath302 is a family of lines in @xmath308 .",
    "selecting a value for @xmath303 selects a particular line from this family .",
    "thus , if one has chosen a particular value for @xmath33 then the boundary of the parameter space region that yields stable synchronization is the intersection of a line and a parabola .",
    "for this example this intersection always exists .",
    "intersections of lines associated with @xmath306 ( for fixed @xmath33 ) sweep out a portion of the parabola .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath301 ( equivalently , fixed @xmath33 ) the portion of the parabola that is beyond the line associated with @xmath307 corresponds to values of the coupling parameters that produce stable synchronous motion .",
    "now recall that the value of @xmath33 is arbitrary , and different values of @xmath33 yield different parabolas . for each different value of @xmath33",
    "the rigorous criterion chooses a portion of a parabola .",
    "therefore , the region of parameter space that satisfies the rigorous criterion is the one swept out by portions of the parabolas for all possible values of @xmath33 .",
    "this region occupies positive volume in the parameter space , @xmath205 .",
    "in this appendix we discuss relationship between our results and those found in control theory , and alternate formulations of the rigorous criterion .",
    "the relationship between synchronization and control has been know for some time  @xcite . in these papers synchronization",
    "is typically discussed as an example of feedback control ( see the review by chen and dong  @xcite ) .    in basic control theory one",
    "is often interested in the following equation @xmath309 where @xmath310 is a time dependent scalar input ( the drive ) . in this equation",
    "we are invited to think of @xmath311 as the uncontrolled dynamics and @xmath312 is a vector which couples the input to the uncontrolled dynamics .",
    "an important question in control theory is , can one find inputs , @xmath310 , so that the @xmath313 in finite time .",
    "the answer to this question is often determined by constructing a controllability matrix @xmath314 where @xmath315 $ ] .",
    "it is known that if @xmath316 has full rank ( @xmath317 ) then one can find inputs so that @xmath318  @xcite .",

    "the difficulty with the controllability approach is that @xmath324 has a complicated time dependence .",
    "avoiding this complication is one of the motivations for considering the equation @xmath325 \\w , \\ ] ] where  and  are defined by eqs .",
    "( [ def_a ] and ( [ def_b ] ) . in this formulation of the problem",
    "the coupling strengths ( @xmath9 ) are part of , we think of  as the uncontrolled dynamics , and @xmath326 are driving inputs . in effect the rigorous criterion of eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) says that if the eigenvalues of  are placed sufficiently far into the right half plane ( as a result of feedback coupling ) from the fluctuation that result from the chaotic driving will not be sufficient to destabilize the fixed point at @xmath327 . in this sense",
    "our criterion is similar in spirit to pole placement control theory .",
    "we remark that the controllability matrix can not be immediately calculated for eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) because @xmath322 is a function that maps input space into state space while  is a function that maps state space into itself . in eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) the function that plays the role of @xmath322 is part of the matrix .",
    "we believe that a different interpretation of synchronization ( still from control theory ) could be quite promising .",
    "walker and mees interpret synchronization as an example state estimation and the observer problem  @xcite .",
    "this view of synchronization says that synchronization permits one to estimate the complete state of a system when the full state vector is not observable .",
    "in practice one could imagine coupling the output from a physical system to a model of the system using coupling that is guaranteed to result in stable synchronization .",
    "( here we rely on the fact that synchronization is robust to modeling errors and noise  @xcite ) .",
    "the full state of the physical is then the same as the state of the model . for linear system",
    "the observer problem and the control problem can can be shown to be duals of each other  @xcite .",
    "thus , many of the results proved for observability of a dynamical system are corollaries of theorems proved for control . in this paper a rigorous and easy to calculate criterion for synchronization is given .",
    "in this appendix we describe a derivation that leads to a rigorous criterion similar to the one derived in section  [ theory1 ] .",

    "this equation leads to eq .",
