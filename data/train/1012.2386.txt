    "very little is known about the magnetic fields of hot , massive ob stars , due at least in part to the challenges of measurement . even as a member of the elusive class of magnetic massive stars , the b0.2 v star @xmath0sco is recognised to be a peculiar and outstanding object .",
    "the magnetic field of @xmath0sco is unique because it is structurally far more complex than the mostly - dipolar fields ( @xmath1 ) usually observed in magnetic ob stars , with significant power in spherical - harmonic modes up to @xmath2 with a mean surface field strength of @xmath3 g ( donati et al .",
    "2006 )    @xmath0sco also stands out from the crowd of early - b stars because of its stellar wind anomalies , as diagnosed through its odd uv spectrum ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the uv wind line morphology of normal , early b stars conforms to a 2-d spectral grid ( walborn et al .",
    "typically , civ strengthens with increasing temperature and luminosity .",
    "nv is at most a trace on the main sequence at spectral type b0v but strengthens with temperature and luminosity for more luminous stars . for stars with fixed civ and nv ,",
    "siiv is strictly luminosity dependent and breaks the degeneracy .",
    "@xmath0sco does not fit into this grid .",
    "it has strong nv indicating that it should be well above the main sequence .",
    "however , its civ lines are only slightly stronger than typical and not distinctly wind - like , suggesting a near main sequence luminosity . finally , its siiv profiles are unique , a bit stronger than typical class v stars , but unlike normal , early giants . as a result , this stars lie outside of the normal classification grid , which suggests a more highly ionized outflow than typical .",
    "the hard x - ray emission of @xmath0sco also suggests hot plasma , in excess of 10mk ( cassinelli et al .",
    "1994 ) .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=201 ]    interestingly , the wind lines of @xmath0sco vary periodically with the star s 41d rotation period ( donati et al .",
    "clearly the magnetic field exerts an important influence on the wind dynamics .",
    "what is not clear is whether the wind - line anomalies described above are a consequence of the unusual complexity of @xmath0sco s magnetic field , a general consequence of wind confinement in this class of star , or perhaps even unrelated to the presence of a magnetic field .    because such wind anomalies have never been observed in any other star , magnetic or not , this issue has remained unresolved",
    ". the identification and analysis of additional stars with wind properties similar to @xmath0sco would therefore represent an important step toward understanding the origin of these peculiarities .",
    "we present two early b - type stars - hd66665 and hd63425 - that we identified to be the first @xmath0sco analogues ( petit et al .",
    "these stars were first discovered by their uv spectra , which are strikingly similar to the uv spectrum of @xmath0sco .",
    "the discovery of wind anomalies naturally led to an investigation of the magnetic properties of these stars by the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes ) collaboration ( wade et al .",
    "2010 ; this proceeding ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of hd66665 and hd63425 were taken with espasons at the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "we acquired 4 high - resolution , broad - band , intensity ( stokes i ) and circular polarisation ( stokes v ) for each star .",
    "in order to determine the stellar and wind parameters of hd66665 and hd63425 we used non - lte model atmospheres from the cmfgen code ( hillier & miller 1998 ) .",
    "the physical parameters , shown in tab . 1 , are similar to @xmath0sco s .",
    "uv spectra from iue were used to infer stellar wind properties . the absorption shown by civ",
    "can not be reproduced in detail by our models . on the other hand , we could achieve an acceptable fit for the siiv and nv lines .",
    "the inclusion of x - rays in our cmfgen models was essential in producing the nv feature , since the wind structure is not sufficiently ionized without this component .",
    "we could derive an upper limit for the mass - loss rate from the emission part of the synthetic p - cygni profile the civ line and a rough estimate for the wind terminal velocity could be made .",
    "the mass - loss rate upper limits are much lower than the mass - loss rate assumed for @xmath0sco ( @xmath7m@xmath8yr@xmath9 ; see donati et al . 2006 , and references therein ) . in fact ,",
    "hd66665 and hd63425 should be considered as weak wind stars ( martins et al . 2005 ; marcolino et al .",
    "2009 ) , since their expected mass - loss rate is about @xmath10m@xmath8yr@xmath9 ( following the recipe provided by vink et al .",
    "we therefore believe that the mass - loss rate found for @xmath0sco in the literature has been over - estimated .",

    "this procedure enables the simultaneous use of many lines present in a spectrum to detect a magnetic field stokes v signature .",
    "assumptions , limitations and numerical tests of this method are presented by kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "all observations led to the detection of a magnetic signal ( see fig .",
    "the same analysis was performed on the diagnostic null profiles , and no signal was detected . as the exact rotation phases of our observations are not known , we used the method described by petit et al .",
    "( 2008 ; in prep ) , which compares the observed stokes v profiles to a large grid of synthetic profiles , described by a dipole oblique rotator model . the model is parametrized by the dipole field strength @xmath16 , the rotation axis inclination @xmath17 with respect to the line of sight , the positive magnetic axis obliquity @xmath18 and the rotational phase @xmath19 . assuming that only @xmath19 may change between different observations of a given star , the goodness - of - fit of a given rotation - independent ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) magnetic configuration can be computed to determine configurations that provides good posterior probabilities for all the observed stokes v profiles , in a bayesian statistic framework .",
    "the inclined dipole model can reproduce the current observations in a satisfactory fashion , although the @xmath20 remains high for some observations ( those with the highest s / n ) . whether these deviations from the model come from artefacts of the lsd procedure ,",
    "systematics introduced by our simple line profile modelling , or a more complex field , remains to be investigated once phase - resolved observations are obtained and a more detailed analysis can be performed .    by treating any features that can not be explained by the inclined dipole model as additional gaussian noise , we can obtain a conservative estimate of the model parameters ( see fig .",
    "our modelling of the lsd stokes v profiles by an inclined dipole model results in field strengths that are comparable with , or maybe slightly larger than , the mean surface field strength of @xmath0sco .",
    "the exact value of the surface field strength is however highly dependent on the dipole geometry , and varies from 600 g to 1.6 kg for hd66665 and from 400 g to 1.8 kg for hd63425 .",
    "we have presented the characteristics of two stars - hd66665 and hd63425 - which we believe are analogues to the magnetic massive star @xmath0sco .",
    "the uv spectra of these stars are similar to the once - unique spectrum of @xmath0sco .",
    "we have shown that these three stars have similar fundamental properties , although the mass - loss rate values we estimate for hd66665 and hd63425 are lower than the value generally assumed for @xmath0sco .",
    "we have shown that these two stars host a magnetic field .",
    "our modelling of the lsd stokes v profiles by an inclined dipole model results in field strengths that are comparable with , or maybe slightly larger than , the mean surface field strength of @xmath0sco .",
    "the current observations can be acceptably reproduced by the dipole model , although more phase - resolved observations are required in order to assess the potential complexity of their magnetic field , and verify if the wind anomalies are linked to the field complexity ."
