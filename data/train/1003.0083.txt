    "the present paper is devoted to the analysis of the mathematical properties of non homogeneous networks obtained by adding density zero perturbations to homogeneous cayley trees , the latter being the cayley graphs of free ( products of ) groups , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ figc ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . as explained in the previous paper @xcite , such mathematical properties",
    "are deeply connected with the bose einstein condensation ( bec for short ) of bardeen cooper pairs in networks describing arrays of josephson junctions ( see e.g. section 62 of @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the formal hamiltonian describing such arrays of josephson junctions is the quartic bose hubbard hamiltonian , given on a generic network @xmath0 by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 denotes the set of the vertices of the network @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the bosonic creator , and @xmath4 the number operator on the site @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , @xmath6 is the adjacency operator whose matrix element @xmath7 in the place @xmath8 is the number of the edges connecting the site @xmath9 with the site @xmath10 ( in particular it is hermitian ) .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that , in the case when @xmath11 and @xmath12 are negligible with respect to @xmath13 , the hopping term dominates the physics of the system .",
    "thus , under this approximation , becomes the _",
    "pure hopping hamiltonian _ given by @xmath14 where the constant @xmath15 is a mean field coupling constant which might be different from the @xmath13 appearing in the more realistic hamiltonian . appearing in the pure hopping hamiltonian .",
    "however , it might be reasonable to accept the idea that , at very low temperature when the thermal agitation plays a negligible role , the pure hopping term dominates the remaining ones in . ] recently , in some crucial experiments ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it was found an enhanced current at low temperatures for non homogeneous arrays of josephson junctions , which might be explained via the bose einstein condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "it was showed in theorem 7.6 of @xcite , that for free models ( i.e. when @xmath16 in ) , the condensation phenomena can occur after adding a negligible number of edges , only if the hamiltonian is pure hopping .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 5.2 ) that most of the physical properties of the quadratic multi particle hamiltonian are encoded into the spectral properties of the one particle hamiltonian @xmath17 naturally acting on @xmath18 . in light of the previous considerations , it is natural to address the investigation of the pure hopping mathematical model described by the hamiltonian obtained by putting @xmath19 in , and normalizing to ensure the positivity of the energy .",
    "the resulting one particle hamiltonian for the purely topological model under consideration is then @xmath20 where @xmath6 is the adjacency of the fixed graph @xmath0 , acting on the hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "one of the first mathematical attempts to investigate the bec on non homogeneous amenable graphs , such as the comb graphs , was made in @xcite . in that paper , it was pointed out that there appears an _ hidden spectrum _ , which is responsible for the finiteness of the critical density .",
    "in addition , the behavior of the wave function of the ground state , describing the spatial density of the condensate , was also computed .",
    "some spectral properties of the comb and the star graph ( cf . fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) were investigated in @xcite in connection with the various notions of independence in quantum probability . in that paper , it was noticed the possible connection between such spectral properties and the bec .",
    "the systematic investigation of the bec for the pure hopping model on a wide class of amenable networks obtained by negligible perturbations of periodic graphs , has been started in @xcite .",
    "the emerging results are quite surprising .",
    "first of all , the appearance of the hidden spectrum was proven for most of the graphs under consideration .",
    "this is due to the combination of two opposite phenomena arising from the perturbation .",
    "if the perturbation is sufficiently large ( in many cases it is enough a finite perturbation ) , the norm @xmath21 of the adjacency of the perturbed graph becomes larger than the analogous one @xmath22 of the unperturbed adjacency . on the other hand ,",
    "as the perturbation is sufficiently small ( i.e. zero  density ) , the part of the spectrum @xmath23 in the segment @xmath24 $ ] does not contribute to the density of the states .",
    "whose support is included in the closed line @xmath25 .",
    "see section [ giem ] below , and the reference cited therein .",
    "] this allows us to compute the critical density @xmath26 at the inverse temperature @xmath27 for the perturbed model by using the integrated density of the states @xmath28 of the unperturbed one , @xmath29 the resulting effect of the perturbed model exhibiting the hidden spectrum ( i.e. when @xmath30 ) is that the critical density is always finite .",
    "another relevant fact connected with the introduction of the perturbation , and thus to the non homogeneity , is the possible change of the transience / recurrence character ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 6 ) of the adjacency operator .",
    "it has to do with the possibility to construct locally normal states exhibiting bec .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the last relevant fact is the investigation of the shape of wave function of the ground state of the model , describing the spatial distribution of the condensate on the network in the ground state of the hamiltonian . from the mathematical viewpoint , this is nothing but the perron frobenius generalized eigenvector of the adjacency ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it appears clear that the physical and the mathematical aspects of the topological model based on the pure hopping hamiltonian are strongly related .",
    "this can be understood also in the following simple way . for bosonic models , described by the canonical commutation relations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , most of the physical relevant quantities are computed by the functional calculus of suitable functions of the one particle hamiltonian .",
    "the critical density is one of them .",
    "but , the asymptotic behavior of the hamiltonian near zero corresponds to the asymptotics of the spectrum of @xmath6 close to @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , by the taylor expansion , we heuristically get for the function appearing in the bose gibbs occupation number ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 54 ) at small energies , for the chemical potential @xmath31 , @xmath32 then the study of the bec is reduced to the investigation of the spectral properties of the resolvent @xmath33 , for @xmath34 .",
    "the networks under consideration in the present paper are density zero additive perturbations of exponentially growing graphs made of homogeneous cayley trees , see fig .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the mathematical aspects explained below . among the models treated in the present paper , we mention the perturbations @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , of the homogeneous cayley tree @xmath38 along a subtree isomorphic to @xmath39 , and @xmath40 respectively , see below . for these situations , we are able to write down and solve the secular equation .",
    "thus , we can determine the @xmath41 , @xmath42 for which @xmath35 admits the hidden spectrum .",
    "in addition , we provide a useful formula for the resolvent of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we can write down the perron frobenious eigenvector obtained as the infinite volume limit of the finite volume perron frobenius eigenvectors ( normalized to @xmath44 at a fixed root ) , and finally determine whether the perturbed graph is recurrent or transient .",
    "a result which is in accordance with the intuition ( i.e. suggested by the shape of the perron frobenius vector ) , and with the previous ones described in @xcite , is that the recurrence / transience character of @xmath35 and @xmath37 , is determined by that of the base point of the perturbation .",
    "namely , @xmath45 is recurrent as @xmath46 .",
    "the network @xmath37 is transient as the base point of its perturbation , which is isomorphic to @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , proposition 8.2 ) . finally , if @xmath47 , @xmath35 is transient as well , being @xmath39 transient when @xmath47 .",
    "as previously explained , all the results listed below have relevant physical applications to the bec .",
    "we postpone the detailed investigation of such applications to the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , a _ graph _ ( called also a _ network _ ) @xmath48 is a collection @xmath49 of objects , called _ vertices _ , and a collection @xmath50 of unordered lines connecting vertices , called _",
    "edges_. denote @xmath51 the collection of all the edges connecting @xmath52 with @xmath53 . as the edges are unordered , @xmath54 .",
    "two vertices @xmath52 , @xmath53 are said to be _ adjacent _ if there exists an edge @xmath55 joining @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "the definition used here implies @xmath68 , and is the standard one adopted in the physical literature .    in the present paper , all the graphs",
    "are connected , countable and with uniformly bounded degree .",
    "in addition , we deal only with bounded operators acting on @xmath69 if it is not otherwise specified .",

    "the perron frobenius eigenvector is unique up to a multiplicative constant , if @xmath59 is finite or when @xmath70 is recurrent , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it is unique also for the adjacency on the tree like networks ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in general , it is not unique , see e.g. @xcite for the cases relative to the comb graphs .",

    "if there exists a constant @xmath76 such that , for any @xmath77 , the support of @xmath78 is contained in the ( closed ) ball @xmath79 centered in @xmath52 and with radius @xmath80 .",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath6 is the adjacency operator on @xmath59 , then @xmath81 has propagation @xmath82 for any integer @xmath83 .",
    "the graphs we deal with in our analysis are ( additive , negligible ) perturbations of homogeneous cayley trees if it is not otherwise specified .",

    "one of the most useful objects for infinite systems like those considered in the present paper is the so called integrated density of the states .",
    "we start with the following definition .",
    "consider on @xmath95 the state @xmath96 @xmath93 being the selfadjoint projection onto @xmath94 .",

    "<S> we study some spectral properties of the adjacency operator of non homogeneous networks . </S>",
    "<S> the graphs under investigation are obtained by adding density zero perturbations to the homogeneous cayley trees . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the natural mathematical meaning , such spectral properties are relevant for the bose einstein condensation for the pure hopping model describing arrays of josephson junctions on non homogeneous networks . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting topological model is described by a one particle hamiltonian which is , up to an additive constant , the opposite of the adjacency operator on the graph . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the bose einstein condensation already occurs for unperturbed homogeneous cayley trees . however , the particles condensate on the perturbed graph , even in the configuration space due to nonhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> even if the graphs under consideration are exponentially growing , we show that it is enough to perturb in a negligible way the original graph in order to obtain a new network whose mathematical and physical properties dramatically change . among the results proved in the present paper , we mention the following ones . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the _ hidden spectrum _ near the zero of the hamiltonian , or equivalently below the norm of the adjacency . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is related with the value of the critical density and then with the appearance of the condensation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of the _ recurrence / transience character _ of the adjacency , which is connected to the possibility to construct locally normal states exhibiting the bose einstein condensation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the study of the _ volume growth of the wave function _ of the ground state of the hamiltonian , which is nothing but the generalized perron frobenius eigenvector of the adjacency . </S>",
    "<S> this perron frobenius weight describes the spatial distribution of the condensate and its shape is connected with the possibility to construct locally normal states exhibiting the bose einstein condensation at a fixed density greater than the critical one .    </S>",
