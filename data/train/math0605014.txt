    "the approach we follow in this paper relates more to the second example , that of the euclidean ball , where the `` true source '' of the gaussian approximation may be attributed to geometry .",

    "the quantitative estimate we provide for @xmath62 is rather poor .",
    "while theorem [ thm_basic ] seems to be a reasonable analog of the classical central limit theorem for the category of log - concave densities , we are still lacking the precise berry - esseen type bound .",
    "a plausible guess might be that the logarithmic dependence should be replaced by a power - type decay , in the bound for @xmath62 .",

    "dvoretzky s theorem shows that @xmath76-dimensional geometric projections of an @xmath20-dimensional convex body are @xmath96-close to a euclidean ball , provided that @xmath97 .",
    "theorem [ thm_multi ] states that @xmath76-dimensional marginals , or measure - projections , of an @xmath20-dimensional convex body are @xmath96-close to gaussian when @xmath98 .",
    "thus , according to dvoretzky s theorem , the geometric shape of the support of the marginal distribution may be approximated by a very regular body  a euclidean ball , or an ellipsoid  whereas theorem [ thm_multi ] demonstrates that the marginal distribution itself is very regular ; it is approximately normal .",
    "more parallels between theorem [ thm_multi ] and dvoretzky s theorem are apparent from the proof of theorem [ thm_multi ] below .",
    "we currently do not know whether there exists a single subspace that satisfies both the conclusion of theorem [ thm_multi ] and the conclusion of dvoretzky s theorem simultaneously ; both theorems show that a `` random subspace '' works with large probability , but with respect to different euclidean structures . the logarithmic dependence on the dimension is known to be tight in milman s form of dvoretzky s theorem .",
    "however , we have no reason to believe that the quantitative estimates in theorem [ thm_multi ] are the best possible .    there are several mathematical articles where theorem [ thm_basic ] is explicitly conjectured .",
    "brehm and voigt suggest theorem [ thm_basic ] as a conjecture in @xcite , where they write that this conjecture appears to be `` known among specialists '' .",
    "anttila , ball and perissinaki formulated the same conjecture in @xcite , independently and almost simultaneously with brehm and voigt .",
    "anttila , ball and perissinaki also proved the conjecture for the case of uniform distributions on convex sets whose modulus of convexity and diameter satisfy certain quantitative assumptions .",
    "gromov wrote a remark in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2 ) that seems related to theorem [ thm_basic ] and theorem [ thm_multi ] , especially in view of the techniques we use here . following @xcite and @xcite , significant contributions regarding the central limit problem for convex sets",
    "were made by bastero and bernus @xcite , bobkov @xcite , bobkov and koldobsky @xcite , brehm and voigt @xcite , brehm , hinow , vogt and voigt @xcite , koldobsky and lifshits @xcite , e. and m. meckes @xcite , e. milman @xcite , naor and romik @xcite , paouris @xcite , romik @xcite , s. sodin @xcite , wojtaszczyk @xcite and others .",
    "let us explain a few ideas from our proof .",
    "we begin with a general principle that goes back to sudakov @xcite and to diaconis and freedman @xcite ( see also the expositions of bobkov @xcite and von weizscker @xcite .",
    "a sharpening for the case of convex bodies was obtained by anttila , ball and perissinaki @xcite ) .",
    "this principle reads as follows : suppose @xmath2 is any random vector in @xmath5 with zero mean and identity covariance matrix",
    ". then most of the marginals of @xmath2 are approximately gaussian , if and only if the random variable @xmath99 is concentrated around the value one . in other words ,",
    "typical marginals are approximately gaussian if and only if most of the mass is concentrated on a `` thin spherical shell '' of radius @xmath100 and width much smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , to a certain extent , our task is essentially reduced to proving the following :    let @xmath14 be an integer and let @xmath2 be a random vector with an isotropic , log - concave density in @xmath5 .",
    "then for all @xmath101 , @xmath102 where @xmath103 are universal constants .",
    "[ cor_202 ]    a significantly superior estimate to that of theorem [ cor_202 ] , for the case where @xmath96 is a certain universal constant greater than one , is given by paouris @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to try and improve the bound in theorem [ cor_202 ] also for smaller values of @xmath96 .",
    "returning to the sketch of the proof , suppose that we are given a random vector @xmath2 in @xmath5 with an isotropic , log - concave density .",
    "we need to show that most of its marginals are almost - gaussian .",
    "select a random @xmath76-dimensional subspace @xmath78 , for a certain integer @xmath76 .",
    "we use a concentration of measure inequality  in a way similar to milman s proof of dvoretzky s theorem  to show that with large probability of choosing the subspace @xmath82 , the distribution of the random vector @xmath104 is approximately spherically - symmetric .",
    "this step is carried out in section [ section3 ] , and it is also outlined by gromov ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2 ) .    fix a subspace @xmath82 such that @xmath104 is approximately spherically - symmetric . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we use the fourier transform to conclude that the approximation by a spherically - symmetric distribution actually holds in the stronger @xmath105-sense , after convolving with a gaussian . in section [ section5 ] we show that the gaussian convolution has only a minor effect , and we obtain a spherically - symmetric approximation to @xmath104 in the total - variation , @xmath51-sense .",
    "thus , we obtain a density in the subspace @xmath82 that has two properties : it is log - concave , by prkopa - leindler , and it is also approximately radial .",
    "a key observation is that such densities are necessarily very close to the uniform distribution on the sphere ; this observation boils down to estimating the asymptotics of some one - dimensional integral . at this point",
    ", we further project our density , that is already known to be close to the uniform distribution on a sphere , to any lower - dimensional subspace . by maxwell s principle",
    "we obtain an approximately gaussian distribution in this lower - dimensional subspace .",

    "therefore , when @xmath37 is isotropic and log - concave , @xmath115 is also isotropic and log - concave",
