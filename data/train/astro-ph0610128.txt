    "in order to obtain reliable empirical information on the strength and geometry of astrophysical magnetic fields we need to develop and apply suitable diagnostic tools within the framework of the quantum theory of spectral line polarization ( e.g. , the recent monograph by * ? ? ?",
    ". a nave knowledge and/or an unjustified neglect of some of the physical mechanisms that produce polarization in spectral lines may lead to significant errors in our inferences and/or to missing the exciting opportunity of proposing new practical ideas for magnetic field diagnostics . in this respect ,",
    "the main aim of this paper is to help clarify further the physics of the observed polarization in the spectral lines of the he i 10830   multiplet , because they contain precious information on the dynamical and magnetic properties of a variety of solar chromospheric and coronal structures .",
    "the most important mechanisms that induce and modify polarization signatures in the spectral lines that originate in the atmospheres of the sun and of other stars are the zeeman effect , anisotropic radiation pumping and the hanle effect ( e.g. , the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "the zeeman effect requires the presence of a magnetic field , which causes the atomic and molecular energy levels to split into different magnetic sublevels characterized by their magnetic quantum number @xmath3 . as a result ,",
    "the wavelength positions of the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) transitions do not coincide and , therefore , their respective polarization signals do not cancel out .",
    "the zeeman effect is most sensitive in _ circular _ polarization ( quantified by the stokes @xmath10 parameter ) , with a magnitude that for not too strong fields scales with the ratio between the zeeman splitting and the width of the spectral line ( which is very much larger than the natural width of the atomic levels ! ) .",
    "this so - called _ longitudinal _ zeeman effect responds to the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field . in contrast , the _ transverse _ zeeman effect responds to the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight , producing instead _ linear _ polarization signals ( quantified by the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters ) that are normally below the noise level of present observational possibilities for intrinsically weak fields ( typically b@xmath11 gauss for solar spectropolarimetry ) .    the anisotropic illumination of the atoms in the outer regions of a stellar atmosphere may produce atomic level polarization ( that is , population imbalances and/or quantum coherences between the magnetic sublevels pertaining to the upper and/or lower level of the line transition under consideration ) , in such a way that the populations of substates with different values of @xmath12 are different .",
    "this is termed _ atomic level alignment_. under such circumstances , the polarization signals of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 transitions do not cancel out , even in the absence of a magnetic field , simply because the population imbalances among the magnetic sublevels imply more or less @xmath4 transitions , per unit volume and time , than @xmath13 transitions .",
    "interestingly , this atomic level polarization is modified by the presence of a magnetic field _ inclined _ with respect to the symmetry axis of the pumping radiation field ( i.e. , the hanle effect ; e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic field intensity ( measured in gauss ) that is sufficient to produce a sizable change in the atomic polarization of a given level is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the level s lifetime ( in seconds ) and its land factor .",
    "as discussed by @xcite a notable example of a multiplet whose spectral lines are sensitive to both effects ( that is , to the zeeman splitting and to the atomic level polarization ) is the he i 10830   multiplet , whose stokes profiles can be observed in a variety of plasma structures of the solar chromosphere and corona , such as sunspots @xcite , coronal filaments @xcite , prominences @xcite , emerging flux regions @xcite , chromospheric spicules @xcite , active region filaments ( martnez pillet et al .",
    "2006 ; in preparation ) and flaring regions ( sasso et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the he  i 10830   multiplet originates between a lower term ( @xmath17 ) and an upper term ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "therefore , it comprises three spectral lines : a ` blue ' component at 10829.09    ( with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , and two ` red ' components at 10830.25    ( with @xmath21 ) and at 10830.34    with ( @xmath22 ) which appear blended at solar atmospheric temperatures .",
    "although the circular polarization of the he i 10830   lines is dominated by the longitudinal zeeman effect , we expect their linear polarization to be the result of the joint action of the transverse zeeman effect and of the atomic polarization that anisotropic radiation pumping processes induce in the helium levels .",
    "actually , as we shall show in this paper , the degree of anisotropy of the solar continuum radiation at the wavelengths of the relevant helium transitions is sufficiently important so as to produce a significant amount of atomic polarization in the lower and upper levels of the he i 10830 multiplet , even at relatively low atmospheric heights ( e.g. , @xmath231000 km ) .",
    "elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms are unable to destroy this atomic polarization that the anisotropy of the solar radiation field can ( in principle ) induce in the helium levels .",
    "obviously , for sufficiently weak magnetic fields ( e.g. , for @xmath24 g ) the linear polarization is dominated by the _ selective emission _ and _ selective absorption _ of polarization components that result from the atomic level polarization @xcite .",
    "however , it would not be correct to give for granted that for relatively strong fields ( say , for @xmath25 g ) the linear polarization of the he i 10830   multiplet is going to be necessarily dominated by the transverse zeeman effect .    unfortunately , with very few exceptions @xcite",
    ", the modeling of spectropolarimetric observations of the he i 10830   multiplet has been carried out without taking into account that , in principle , the observed linear polarization may be actually the result of the joined action of the transverse zeeman effect and of the atomic level polarization . to neglect _ a priori",
    "_ the influence of atomic level polarization simply because the considered point of the observed field of view is significantly magnetized is not justified .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation when the plasma diagnostics is being done via the analysis of only the stokes @xmath26 and @xmath10 profiles , such as those measured in sunspot umbrae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it might not be so adequate in the case that stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also considered , such as those observed by @xcite and @xcite in emerging flux regions .",
    "a recent investigation has already pointed out that , even when only the contribution of the zeeman effect is accounted for , the wavelength positions and the strengths of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 components should be calculated in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime , given that the linear zeeman effect theory _ overestimates _ the amplitudes of the emergent linear and circular polarization that is , it _ underestimates _ the inferred magnetic field strength @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus instead on clarifying the role played by the presence of atomic level polarization on the emergent stokes profiles of the he i 10830   multiplet for increasing values of the strength of the assumed magnetic field .",
    "as we shall see below , the influence of atomic level polarization on the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles of the he i 10830   multiplet turns out to be significant , even for magnetic field strengths as large as 1000 g. in fact , as pointed out below , some of the stokes profiles of emerging flux regions that @xcite and @xcite have interpreted in terms of the linear zeeman effect theory neglecting atomic level polarization show , however , clear observational signatures of the presence of this physical ingredient . on the other hand , if any stokes profiles observation of a moderately magnetized solar atmospheric region turns out to show no hint at all of the presence of atomic level polarization ( such as it seems to be the case with the active region filament observations reported by v. martnez pillet and collaborators during the fourth international workshop on solar polarization ) the reason , in our opinion , is to be found in the lower degree of anisotropy of the radiation field that pumps the helium atoms inside such elongated , optically - thick plasma structures .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the formulation of the problem is presented in section 2 , where we inform about the equations we have solved for calculating the emergent stokes profiles from an optically thick slab located at a height of about 2000 km above the solar visible  surface \" .",
    "section 3 shows several illustrative examples of the generated spectral line polarization when neglecting or taking into account the atomic level polarization induced by the photospheric continuum radiation .",
    "section 4 investigates the extent to which the anisotropy of the photospheric radiation field may be modified by the radiation generated by the assumed plasma structure itself .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarize the main conclusions of our work and insist on the scientific interest for spectropolarimetry from space .",
    "as illustrated in fig . 1 , we consider a constant - property slab of magnetized chromospheric material located at a height of only 3 arc seconds ( @xmath27 ) km above the solar  visible \" surface . the magnetic field ,",
    "whose strength we will vary at will , is assumed to be horizontal ( i.e. , parallel to the solar  surface \" ) .",
    "the slab s optical thickness at the wavelength and line of sight under consideration is @xmath28 , while the symbol @xmath29 denotes the optical thickness of the slab along its normal direction at the line center of the red blended component .",
    "we have chosen @xmath30 , which is just at the transition limit between an optically thin and an optically thick medium .",
    "all the atoms inside this slab are assumed to be illuminated by the unpolarized and limb - darkened photospheric radiation field whose center - to - limb variation has been tabulated by @xcite .",
    "this implies that , for the moment , we are neglecting the influence of possible radiative transfer effects inside this @xmath30 slab on the anisotropy factor , whose definition is @xcite    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being the angle between the ray under consideration and the solar local vertical ) .",
    "therefore , in a stellar atmosphere the possible values of the anisotropy factor vary between @xmath36 for the limiting case of illumination by a purely horizontal radiation field without any azimuthal dependence , and @xmath37 for purely vertical illumination .",
    "two main factors contribute to the value of @xmath38 at a given height in the _ quiet _ solar atmosphere : ( 1 ) the center to limb variation of the solar radiation field at the wavelength under consideration and ( 2 ) the geometrical effect due to the fact that , the larger the atmospheric height , the smaller the solid angle subtended by the solar visible sphere .",
    "we point out that , at a height of 3 arc seconds in the quiet solar atmosphere , @xmath39 at 10830  , while @xmath40 if only the above - mentioned geometrical effect is taken into account ( that is , when the contribution due to the center - to - limb variation is disregarded ) .",
    "the radiative transitions caused by the anisotropic illumination of the slab s helium atoms induce population imbalances and quantum coherences among the magnetic substates of the energy levels ( that is , atomic level polarization ) , which we quantify by solving the statistical equilibrium equations for the multipole components , @xmath41 , of the atomic density matrix ( see section 7.6a in * ? ? ?",
    "we do this using a realistic model atom that includes the 5 lowest terms of the triplet system of neutral helium , which implies 11 @xmath42-levels and 6 transitions between the terms ( see fig . 13.9 in landi deglinnocenti & landolfi 2004 ) .",
    "such equations take fully into account the hanle and zeeman effects produced by the assumed horizontal magnetic field .",
    "we point out that we calculate the wavelength positions and the strengths of the zeeman components in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime . from the calculated density - matrix elements it is then possible to compute the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) of the emission vector and the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 of the @xmath49 propagation matrix of the stokes vector transfer equation for a wavelength interval covering the 10830   multiplet ( see sections 7.6b in * ? ? ?",
    "the emergent stokes vector @xmath50 ( with @xmath51=transpose , @xmath52 the frequency and @xmath53 the line of sight ) is given by the following expression , which can be easily obtained as a particular case of eq .",

    "the coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 depend only on the optical depth of the slab at the frequency and line - of - sight under consideration and their expressions are : @xmath69    it is of interest to note that when the anomalous dispersion terms are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shortcar ] ) ( i.e. , the @xmath48 terms are taken equal to zero ) we obtain    @xmath70    @xmath71    these approximate formulae for the emergent stokes parameters coincide with those proposed by @xcite for modeling the hanle and zeeman effects in solar chromospheric spicules and coronal filaments , which provide a very good approximation whenever @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "although such inequalities are often met in solar spectropolarimetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all the calculations of this paper have however been carried out using the exact analytical solution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : shortcar ] ) , because they allow us to provide accurate results also for relatively high field strength values .",
    "it is of interest to point out that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : stokesi ] ) and ( [ eq : stokesx ] ) simplify as follows for the optically thin and optically thick limiting cases :    \\(1 ) _ optically thin case _ ( @xmath74 )    @xmath75    @xmath76    \\(2 ) _ optically thick case _ ( @xmath77 )    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 .",
    "this section presents results for the two line of sights illustrated in fig . 1 : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being the angle between the solar radius vector through the observed point and the line of sight )",
    ". therefore , @xmath81 corresponds to the case of an off - limb observation ( @xmath0 scattering geometry ) , while @xmath82 to that of a solar disk center observation ( forward scattering geometry ) .",
    "we point out that the boundary conditions are @xmath83 for the @xmath0 scattering case , but @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the forward scattering case ( with @xmath86 taken from @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the emergent stokes profiles corresponding to the two lines of sight illustrated in fig .",
    "the left panels of fig .",
    "2 concern the @xmath0 scattering or @xmath81 case , which is typical of any off - limb observation .",
    "the right panels consider the forward scattering or @xmath82 case , which is typical of an on - disk observation at or close to the center of the solar disk . in both cases",
    "we have assumed a constant - property slab with @xmath30 located at a height of only 3 arc seconds above the visible solar surface . as mentioned above",
    ", the magnetic field is assumed to be horizontal ( i.e. , parallel to the solar  surface \" ) and oriented as indicated in fig .",
    "1  that is , in a way such that also for the off - limb case the magnetic field vector is perpendicular to the line of sight . from top to bottom fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the emergent stokes profiles for increasing values of the magnetic strength and for the following three calculations of increasing realism :    \\(1 ) the dotted lines indicate the case without atomic level polarization . here",
    "the only mechanism responsible for the emergent polarization is the zeeman splitting of the upper and/or lower energy levels , which produces wavelength shifts between the @xmath4 and @xmath13 components , whose positions and strengths have been calculated in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime .",
    "therefore , zero polarization is found for @xmath87 g.    \\(2 ) the dashed lines correspond to the case in which we have taken into account the influence of the atomic polarization of the two upper levels of the he i 10830   multiplet that can carry atomic level polarization -that is , those with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , in addition to the above - mentioned zeeman effect contribution , we have here the possibility of a selective emission of polarization components , even for the zero field case . for example , this is the reason why the dashed line of the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows a non - zero linear polarization signal for the off - limb zero field case .",
    "\\(3 ) the solid lines correspond to the most general situation in which the influence of the atomic polarization of the lower level is also taken into consideration , in addition to that of the upper levels and to the zeeman effect .",
    "the consideration of lower - level polarization has two consequences .",
    "first , the amount of upper level polarization and the ensuing selective emission of polarization components is modified .",
    "second , we can also have a selective absorption of polarization components .",
    "for instance , this is the reason why the blue line of the he i 10830   multiplet shows a non - zero linear polarization signal in the @xmath90 g right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .      as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , for magnetic strengths @xmath24 gauss there is no significant contribution of the transverse zeeman effect . in this _ weak field _",
    "regime the emergent linear polarization is completely dominated by the atomic polarization of the lower and upper levels of the three line transitions involved .",
    "we emphasize that upper - level polarization leads to a _ selective emission _ of polarization components , while lower - level polarization to a _ selective absorption _ of polarization components ( see fig .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , selective absorption is the only mechanism that can produce linear polarization in the blue component of the he i 10830   multiplet .",
    "this is because the total angular momentum of its upper level is @xmath91 , which implies that , in the weak field regime under consideration , @xmath92 .",
    "the reason why the off - limb panels of fig .",
    "2 with @xmath87 and @xmath90 gauss show no linear polarization in that blue line is that our slab with @xmath93 is optically thin at that blue wavelength , and also because eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) with @xmath83 imply    @xmath94    which in the weak field regime is zero for the blue component of the helium multiplet ( because its upper level , with @xmath91 , is intrinsically unpolarizable and @xmath92 ) .",
    "interestingly , the same eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) indicate that , if the boundary intensity @xmath95 were non zero , then there should be a significant @xmath96 signal .",
    "in fact , this is the situation we have in all the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , which correspond to simulated observations at solar disk center .    obviously , due to symmetry reasons , forward scattering processes in the absence of a magnetic field produce zero polarization , as seen in the @xmath87 gauss right panel of fig .",
    "2 . the same applies if there is a microturbulent magnetic field , or if the magnetic field vector is parallel to the symmetry axis of the radiation field that illuminates the slab s helium atoms .",
    "however , as shown in the @xmath90 gauss right panel of fig .",
    "2 , forward scattering processes in the presence of an inclined magnetic field do produce linear polarization in the lines of the he i 10830   multiplet . here ,",
    "the linear polarization is actually _ created _ by the hanle effect .",
    "this is easy to understand by reasoning within the framework of the oscillator model for the hanle effect in a triplet - type transition with @xmath97 and @xmath21 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the more general case of a line transition between two isolated levels having any possible @xmath98 and @xmath99 values , it is first necessary to recall ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the hanle effect tends to destroy the quantum coherences between the magnetic sublevels pertaining to each @xmath42-level , _ without modifying the population imbalances_-level under consideration , which are commonly denoted by the symbol @xmath100 . ] . in the magnetic field reference system , the quantum coherences ( i.e.",
    ", the @xmath101 values with @xmath102 ) tend to vanish for magnetic strengths @xmath103 ( that is , in the saturation regime of the hanle effect ) , so that in practice in this regime we are only left with the population imbalances among the magnetic sublevels pertaining to each @xmath42-level ( i.e. , with the @xmath101 values with @xmath104 ) .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a magnetic field inclined with respect to the symmetry axis of the pumping radiation field , the population imbalances of the upper and/or lower levels can produce linear polarization parallel or perpendicular to the horizontal component of the magnetic field vector , simply because of the ensuing selective emission and selective absorption of polarization components .",
    "the amplitude of the resulting stokes @xmath1 signal can be easily estimated , in the optically thin limit of eq .",
    "( 12 ) and/or in the optically thick limit of eq .",
    "( 14 ) , by introducing into such expressions the following approximate formulae ( see trujillo bueno 2003b ) :    @xmath105    @xmath106    where @xmath107 quantifies the degree of population imbalance of the @xmath42-level under consideration , while @xmath108 and @xmath109 are numerical coefficients that depend on the @xmath98 and @xmath99 values and @xmath110 , with @xmath111 given by eq . ( 10.12 ) of @xcite for @xmath112 . ] ( e.g. , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for a line transition with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for a line transition with @xmath97 and @xmath21 , and @xmath117 for a line transition with @xmath118 ) .",
    "it is very important to note that in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qia ] ) and ( [ eq : qib ] ) @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is _ the angle between the magnetic field vector and the line of sight_.    consider the case of our slab of chromospheric plasma at a given height above the visible solar  surface \" and permeated by a horizontal magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . a magnetic field of 100 gauss is more than sufficient to seriously reduce the quantum coherences ( as quantified in the magnetic field reference frame ) , but is still sufficiently weak so as to be sure that the contribution from the transverse zeeman effect is negligible . for the he i",
    "multiplet this happens for @xmath121 g , approximately . under such circumstances the above - mentioned expressions should provide a reasonable approximation for estimating the emergent @xmath96 at the line center of a significantly strong spectral line . in agreement with our detailed numerical calculations",
    "such approximate formulae predict linear polarization for a disk center observation , be it for a line transition with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or for one with @xmath97 and @xmath21 , or for one with non - zero @xmath98 and @xmath99 values ( except the particular case of a spectral line with @xmath122 , because a level with @xmath123 can not be aligned ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to discussing the cases of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] for which the transverse zeeman effect plays a significant role -that is , those with @xmath124 gauss .",
    "as seen in the corresponding panels , the influence of atomic level polarization on the emergent linear polarization is significant , mainly for the red blended component ( which results from two transitions whose upper levels can be polarized ) .",
    "as expected , the stronger the field the smaller the difference between the solid - line profiles ( which show the joint effect of all physical ingredients ) and the dotted profiles ( which neglect the influence of atomic level polarization ) .",
    "the dashed profiles assume that the lower level is unpolarized , but take into account the selective emission processes that result from the presence of upper - level atomic polarization . for a slab with @xmath30 ( which implies a smaller optical thickness at the wavelength of the blue line ! ) the influence of lower - level polarization is significant for the @xmath125 gauss disk center case , but insignificant for sensibly stronger fields .",
    "however , upper - level polarization plays an important role on the linear polarization of the red blended component , even for magnetic strengths as large as 1000 gauss , for both the off - limb and on - disk cases .",
    "for example , for the @xmath125 gauss case ( which is representative of the strengths found in emerging flux regions ) the accurately computed emergent stokes @xmath1 profile is very different from that obtained taking into account only the influence of the transverse zeeman effect within the framework of the paschen - back effect theory .",
    "interestingly , the above - mentioned observational signature of the presence of atomic polarization in the helium levels is clearly seen in many of the stokes profiles observed in emerging flux regions , such as those of fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "the solid lines of our fig . [ fig : fig3 ] show a good theoretical fit to such observations ( see fig . 2 of lagg et al .",
    "2004 ) , which we have obtained by taking into account the influence of atomic level polarization , in addition to that of the zeeman effect .",
    "the dotted lines of fig . [ fig : fig3 ] neglect , however , the influence of atomic level polarization .",
    "a comparison of such theoretical stokes profiles with those observed by @xcite indicates the presence of atomic level polarization in a relatively strong field region ( @xmath231000 gauss ) .",
    "it also shows that neglecting the influence of atomic level polarization on the emergent stokes profiles is a suitable approximation for interpreting the circular polarization , but an unsuitable one for modeling the observed linear polarization .",
    "we conclude that the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles observed by @xcite in emerging flux regions are strongly modified by the presence of atomic level polarization , even at those atmospheric points of the observed field of view for which field strengths as large as 1000 gauss are inferred . in any case",
    ", it may be tranquilizing to point out that an inversion of the observed profiles neglecting atomic level polarization yields a similar magnetic field vector , in spite of the fact that the corresponding theoretical fit is very poor .",
    "a much better theoretical fit is automatically obtained when the influence of atomic level polarization is properly taken into account , which is important for the reliability of the stokes inversion results ( see asensio ramos & trujillo bueno 2006 , in preparation , for a detailed description of our forward modeling and inversion codes we have applied in this investigation ) .",
    "at the fourth international workshop on solar polarization ( spw4 ) that took place in boulder ( usa ) during september 2005 , v. martnez pillet and collaborators reported on spectropolarimetric observations of ( low - lying ) active region filaments in the he i 10830   multiplet , taken with the new version ( tip-2 ) of the tenerife infrared polarimeter ( martnez pillet et al .",
    "2006 ; in preparation ) .",
    "in particular , in his spw4 talk v. martnez pillet pointed out that the stokes profiles of the observed active region filaments had the typical shape of polarization profiles produced by the zeeman effect , without showing any hint at all of the observational signature of the hanle effect in forward scattering that @xcite had found in solar coronal filaments located at relatively large heights above quiet regions of the solar  surface \" .",
    "in other words , the typical shapes of the linear polarization profiles observed by martnez pillet et al . in active region filaments were similar to those of the dotted lines of fig .",
    "he also reported that hanle - effect signals similar to those found by @xcite were however present in the quiet regions of the observed field of view , outside the filament plasma .    which could be the explanation of this enigmatic observational finding ?",
    "one possibility is that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms completely destroy the polarization of the helium levels , but this is very unlikely because the typical densities of solar plasma structures are too low to affect the ( short - lived ) upper levels .",
    "in fact , simple estimates based on eq .",
    "( 7.108 ) of landi deglinnocenti & landolfi ( 2004 ) suggest that at a height of 2000 km in the fal - c semi - empirical model of fontenla et al .",
    "( 1993 ) the upper - level rates of depolarizing collisions are about four orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding einstein @xmath126-coefficient .",
    "therefore , collisional depolarization seems to be indeed negligible , even if the hydrogen number density of active region filaments were three orders of magnitude larger than those of the fal - c model at chromospheric heights .",
    "another depolarizing possibility could be the bound - free transitions caused by the uv ionizing radiation coming downwards from the corona , but as is well known most of the ionizations take place from the singlet states of he i ( instead of from the triplet states of the 10830   multiplet ) and , in any case , the intensity of the ionizing radiation seems to be too low so as to produce any significant effect ( casini & manso sainz 2006 ; private communication ) .    in our opinion , what is happening here is that the radiation field generated by the active region filament itself ( which is not an optically - thin structure ! ) makes a negative contribution to the anisotropy factor , so that the anisotropy of the true radiation field that illuminates the slab s helium atoms is negligible . in order to investigate this possibility",

    "if the center - to - limb variation is parameterized by the following functional form @xcite @xmath128 the resulting expression for the anisotropy factor is .    @xmath129    where @xmath28 is measured starting at the lower boundary .",

    "it is also interesting to point out that for the case of an isolated slab located at any given height above the solar  visible \" surface the previous expression simplifies considerably , since it is given by    @xmath139    figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows how the anisotropy factor varies inside a slab of optical thickness @xmath140 , which is located at only 3 arc seconds above the visible  surface \" and is illuminated from below by the continuum photospheric radiation .",

    "the dotted horizontal line indicates the value of the anisotropy factor , @xmath38 , that we would have if the contribution of the radiation field generated by the slab itself were neglected .",
    "the remaining curves show the anisotropy factor for a range of @xmath141 values .",

    ", these are precisely the physical conditions inside the active region filaments observed by v. martnez pillet et al . , which are elongated plasma structures located at relatively low heights above the visible solar  surface \" .",
    "the illumination conditions in the emerging flux regions observed by @xcite are clearly different . here",
    "the illumination is due to the typical radiation field of a stratified atmosphere , whose anisotropy is dominated by the positive contribution caused by the limb darkening of the outgoing radiation ( e.g. , trujillo bueno 2001 ) . on the contrary , active region filaments are elongated plasma structures located at relatively low heights above the solar visible  surface \" .",
    "such plasma structures  levitating \" in the solar atmosphere have a significant optical thickness , which implies that we have to take into account the negative contribution to @xmath38 caused by the ( mainly ) horizontal radiation field generated by the filament itself . if this reduction of the radiation field s anisotropy is not taken into account when doing inversions of the stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles observed in such type of optically - thick structures ( that is , when only the positive anisotropy of the photospheric radiation field is considered ) , the inversion algorithm may artificially select magnetic field vectors with inclinations around the van vleck angle ( @xmath146 ) , because it is for this particular inclination that the contribution of atomic level polarization is minimized .",
    "fortunately , the observed stokes @xmath10 profile is often available , but it is very unlikely that the observed linear polarization is automatically reproduced after choosing a magnetic strength that fits the observed circular polarization assuming that the magnetic field inclination is close to that of the van vleck angle . obviously , when a spectropolarimetric observation of the he i 10830   multiplet does not show any hint at all of the presence of atomic level polarization , the best one can do for inferring the magnetic field vector is to apply an inversion code which takes only into account the zeeman effect , but with the positions and strengths of the @xmath4 and @xmath13 components calculated within the framework of the paschen - back effect theory .",
    "probably , one of our most interesting conclusions is that the modeling of the emergent stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles of the he i 10830   multiplet should not be done by neglecting the possible presence of atomic level polarization . actually , the degree of anisotropy of the solar continuum radiation at 10830   is sufficiently important so as to produce a sizable amount of atomic alignment in the lower and upper levels of the he i 10830   multiplet , even at relatively low atmospheric heights such as 1000 km .    for weak magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xmath24 g )",
    "the emergent linear polarization is fully dominated by the _ selective emission _ and _ selective absorption _ of polarization components that result from this atomic level polarization . for stronger magnetic fields ,",
    "the contribution of the transverse zeeman effect can not be neglected .",
    "however , the emergent linear polarization may still show an important contribution caused by the presence of atomic level polarization , even for magnetic strengths as large as 1000 g ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .    in emerging magnetic flux regions the anisotropic illumination of the helium atoms",
    "is expected to be more or less similar to that corresponding to a stratified stellar atmosphere , with the ( mainly vertical ) outgoing radiation contributing with positive values to the anisotropy factor , @xmath38 , and with the ( mainly horizontal ) incoming radiation contributing with negative values . as a result ,",
    "@xmath147 at a height of 3 arc seconds in the quiet solar atmosphere and a significant amount of lower - level and upper - level polarization is induced by the ensuing radiative transitions .",

    "( 2004 ) , even at points of the observed field of view for which magnetic strengths as large as 1000 g are inferred .",
    "the illumination conditions are however different in optically thick plasma structures embedded in the solar atmosphere , such as those encountered in ( low lying ) active regions filaments . here , in addition to the positive contribution to @xmath38 due to the continuum radiation field coming from the underlying solar photosphere , we have to take into account the negative contribution caused by the radiation field generated by the optically - thick plasma structure itself . as a result ,",
    "the anisotropy factor of the true radiation field that illuminates the helium atoms inside the filament plasma may be very different , as illustrated in fig . 4 for the case of a constant - property slab of total optical thickness unity .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath148 we find that @xmath145 at many points inside the slab ( with @xmath95 the intensity of the vertical ray of the photospheric radiation and @xmath149 the slab s source function ) . under such circumstances",
    "the ensuing atomic level polarization turns out to be negligible and the emergent stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 profiles are dominated by the transverse zeeman effect . in our opinion",
    ", this is the main reason that explains the absence of any observational signature of the presence of atomic level polarization in the linear polarization profiles observed by martnez pillet and collaborators in active region filaments .    finally , it is interesting to point out that for the case of isolated plasma structures located at any given height above the solar visible  surface \" the anisotropy factor may reach a significant value ( see the thin solid - line curve of fig .",

    "this suggests that a variety of plasma structures , like loops embedded in the @xmath151 k solar corona , should produce measurable linear polarization even at spectral line wavelengths for which the underlying solar disk is seen completely dark ( e.g. , at the euv and x - ray spectral regions ) .",
