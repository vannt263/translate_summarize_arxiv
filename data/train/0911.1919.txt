    "the string theory motivated higher dimensional gravity , known as the lovelock gravity @xcite attracted much interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "this theory is known to admit the most general higher order invariants in such combinations that the field equations preserve their second order form .",
    "these are important features concerning divergences at smaller scales and ghost free structure toward a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the first few orders of the lovelock lagrangian are well known : zeroth /first order is just the cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) /einstein - hilbert ( eh ) term . the second order lovelock term is known also as the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term , which consists of quadratic invariants and is a highly non - trivial contribution , especially in higher dimensions@xcite .",
    "going to higher order corrections serves only to add contributions at higher levels of intricacy which are crucial in a possible quantum gravity . in spite of all complications",
    "it is remarkable that in a spherically symmetric line element exact black hole solutions are found in higher order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "these metrics are sourced by maxwell and yang - mills ( ym ) fields .",
    "more recently , we obtained black holes in a power - ym source in lovelock theory@xcite . by the power - ym source",
    "it is meant that the source consists of a power of the ym invariant , i.e. , @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 refers to the ym field with gauge group index a and @xmath5 is an arbitrary constant parameter .",
    "although @xmath6 may stand arbitrary , energy and causality conditions restrict it to a certain set of admissible parameters @xcite .    by the same token , in this paper we consider lovelock gravity of all higher orders coupled with a non - linear maxwell ( nlm ) source@xcite .",
    "we prove a theorem , covering lovelock terms to all orders - albeit with proper constant coefficients - which generates new metrics once the nlm energy - momentum is known .",
    "the energy - momentum is given by @xmath7 in which @xmath8 denotes the maxwell invariant . the field equation satisfied by @xmath9",
    "will be referred to as the nlm equation .",
    "the theorem involves spherically symmetric metric ansatz together with the nlm lagrangian which leads to a general class of metrics .",
    "static electric fields fall within the range of our theorem which yields born - infeld ( bi ) electrodynamics as a particular example . a static",
    ", pure magnetic ym field constitutes another example of bi type .    for the first / second order lovelock terms the theorem addresses to eh / gb gravities , resulting in metrics expressed in solutions of first / second order algebraic equations . with equal ease ,",
    "we extend this result to any higher order lovelock gravity in terms of a higher order algebraic equations @xcite . as an interesting example we obtain chern - simons - born - infeld ( csbi ) black hole solutions in odd dimensions .",
    "we elaborate on @xmath10 , to show in particular that the thermodynamically well - behaving cs black hole preserves , its good features when coupled with a bi source in the general relativity limit .",
    "we note that combination of cs and bi types is in an artificial manner since cs / bi black holes arise naturally in odd /even dimensions .",
    "such a combination works only when the @xmath11 ( i.e. , dual of @xmath12 ) vanishes , which occurs in a restricted type of sources .",
    "bi black holes are known to arise naturally from pfaffians only in even dimensional spacetimes @xcite .",
    "depending on the topological parameter @xmath13 and @xmath14 we investigate the hawking temperature of the 5-dimensional csbi black holes .",
    "finally , we investigate the implications of our theorem in the eddington - bondi form of radiating metrics @xcite .",
    "this is the time dependent version of both the mass and charge so that the metrics become time dependent .",
    "that is , we extend the bonnor - vaidya @xcite form of radiating metric to the d - dimensional lovelock gravity coupled with a nlm field .",
    "we consider various types of non - linearities in electromagnetic field as particular examples .",
