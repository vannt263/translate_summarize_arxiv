    "in this paper we study the following problem : let @xmath0 be a riemannian manifold and @xmath1 a @xmath2 submanifold without boundary . we consider a new metric structure @xmath9 on @xmath4 obtained by multiplying the metric @xmath3 by the inverse of the squared distance to @xmath1 .",

    "we call @xmath9 the _ condition metric _ on @xmath4 .",
    "the interest of the condition metric comes from the papers of shub @xcite and beltrn - shub @xcite , where they improve complexity bounds for solving systems of polynomial equations in terms of a certain condition metric on the space @xmath5 of systems , with @xmath1 being the set of ill - conditioned systems to avoid .",
    "although @xmath14 is not always a riemannian manifold , there is still a sensible way to define the concept of geodesic as a path that locally minimizes the distance .",
    "geodesics in the condition metric try to avoid the submanifold @xmath1 because being close to @xmath1 increases their length .",
    "an interesting question about these geodesics is the following : given a geodesic segment in the condition metric , is it true that the closest point from the segment to @xmath1 is one of its endpoints ? sometimes we will refer to this property as ` the worst is at the endpoints ' .",
    "the function @xmath15 is not always smooth , but it can be shown that it is always lipschitz ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 9 ) ) . in this context",
    "the condition metric defines a lipschitz - riemann structure ( in the sense of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 2 ) ) and we have to consider lipschitz curves on @xmath4 .",
    "for such a curve @xmath16 the rademacher theorem states that the tangent vector @xmath17 exists almost everywhere , so it makes sense to define the arc length of @xmath18 w.r.t .",

    "if we examinate some examples in detail , we rapidly realize that a stronger property is satisfied in many cases : the logarithm of the function is also a convex function ( this means that is a _ log - convex _ function ) .",
    "we wonder if this is true in general . more precisely , is the real function @xmath30 convex for every geodesic @xmath18 in the condition metric ?",
    "answering this question is the main goal of our work and our results about it are summarized in theorems [ sn ] and [ hn ] .",
    "if is a convex function for every geodesic @xmath18 in @xmath9 , we will say that the _ self - convexity property _ is satisfied ( maybe the term _ self - log - convexity _ would be more accurate , but we prefer to use this shorter term ) . if the distance function @xmath15 is smooth , then the self - convexity property is equivalent to @xmath31    but if it is not , deciding whether is a convex function or not is much harder a problem . in many cases",

    "let us now briefly discuss the importance of theorem [ sn ] in the context of the question that originated the study of condition metrics . in @xcite the authors noted that studying the condition metric in the set @xmath39    where polynomial systems are assumed to be homogeneous of fixed degree in @xmath40 complex variables , with @xmath41    could be useful for the design of fast homotopy methods to solve polynomial systems ( indeed , the metric used in @xcite is not exactly the condition metric , but it is closely related to it from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 6 ) ) .",
    "the question of self - convexity turned out to be extremely difficult to analyze in this context , which motivated a theoretical and numerical study @xcite of the linear case @xmath42    ( we denote by @xmath43 the set of @xmath44 complex matrices ) with @xmath45    using quite sophisticated an argument , it was proved in @xcite that the self - convexity property holds in @xmath46 .",

    "* proposition 16 ) .",
    "although in this case @xmath56 is not contained in @xmath50 , @xmath57 lies in the boundary of @xmath50 , so the condition metric in @xmath58 can be defined .",
    "the distance function is smooth in @xmath59 and , surprisingly , the smooth self - convexity property ( thus the self - convexity property ) holds for each pair @xmath58 .",
    "then the authors glue all the pieces together and lift the result up to @xmath46 , thus proving that the smooth self - convexity property is satisfied in the linear case .",
    "the problem about self - convexity in @xmath60 remains open , but in view of the fact that self - convexity holds for such complicated cases as ( @xmath61 , @xmath46 and @xmath6 together with any @xmath2 submanifold ( theorem [ rn ] ) , one could hope for the existence of a general argument proving that the smooth self - convexity property holds for every pair @xmath62 under very general assumptions , opening the path to a solution for @xmath60 . theorem [ sn ]",
    "adds another collection of cases to this list , with @xmath5 being @xmath63 and @xmath1 any @xmath2 submanifold .",
    "despite all this ( somehow empirical ) evidence , our last theorem shows that smooth self - convexity can fail , even in a very familiar space .",

    "thus in this case the self - convexity property is not satisfied .",
