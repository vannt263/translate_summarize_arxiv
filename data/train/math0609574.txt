    "induced subgraph poset we mean the _ isomorphism class _ of the induced subgraph poset . in other words , to compute the graph invariants , we do not require the induced subgraphs , but require only the isomorphism class of the induced subgraph poset .",
    "thus many classic results of tutte @xcite(e.g . , reconstruction of the number of spanning trees , the number of hamiltonian cycles , the chromatic polynomial , the characteristic polynomial , the rank polynomial , the number of unicyclic subgraphs containing a cycle of a specified length , etc . ) were proved to be reconstructible from the abstract induced subgraph poset .",
    "computing the above invariants requires counting certain spanning subgraphs , and the proofs involve constructions that are closely related to the connected partition lattice of the graph .",
    "i commented in section 5 of @xcite that understanding a relationship between the induced subgraph poset of a graph and its lattice of connected partitions would be interesting since certain important graph invariants , for example , stanley s chromatic symmetric function , have nice expansions on the connected partition lattice .",

    "another motivation of this paper is a question of stanley regarding the chromatic symmetric function : can non - isomorphic trees have the same chromatic symmetric function ? in @xcite , i proved that a tree can be reconstructed from the isomorphism class of its induced subgraph poset .",
    "one of the constructions presented here implies that a tree can be constructed from its abstract folded connected partition lattice . in another construction , it will be demonstrated that the symmetric tutte polynomial of a tree can be obtained from its chromatic symmetric function , thus showing that the questions raised by stanley , and by noble & welsh are in fact equivalent .    in section  [ sec - edge",
