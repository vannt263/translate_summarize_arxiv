    "dimer model_. it is a statistical mechanics model representing diatomic molecules adsorbed on the surface of a crystal",
    ". an interesting feature of the dimer model is that it is one of the very few statistical mechanics models where exact and explicit results can be obtained , see @xcite for an overview .",
    "another very interesting aspect is the alleged conformal invariance of its scaling limit , which is already proved in the domino and @xmath2-rhombus cases @xcite .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] of this paper shows this property for a wide class of dimer models containing the above two cases.in order to give some insight , let us precisely define the setting .",
    "the * dimer model * is in bijection with a mathematical model called the * @xmath3-tiling model * representing discrete random interfaces .",
    "the _ system _ considered for a @xmath3-tiling model is a planar graph @xmath4 .",
    "_ configurations _ of the system , or * @xmath3-tilings * , are coverings of @xmath4 with polygons consisting of pairs of edge - adjacent faces of @xmath4 , also called * @xmath3-tiles * , which leave no hole and do nt overlap .",
    "the _ system _ of the corresponding dimer model is the dual graph @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "_ configurations _ of the dimer model are * perfect matchings * of @xmath5 , that is set of edges covering every vertex exactly once .",
    "perfect matchings of @xmath5 determine @xmath3-tilings of @xmath4 as explained by the following correspondence .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the dual vertex of a face @xmath7 of @xmath4 , and consider an edge @xmath8 of @xmath5 .",
    "we say that the @xmath3-tile of @xmath4 made of the adjacent faces @xmath7 and @xmath9 is the @xmath3-tile * corresponding * to the edge @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath3-tiles corresponding to edges of a dimer configuration form a @xmath3-tiling of @xmath4 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath10 the set of dimer configurations of @xmath5.as for all statistical mechanics models , dimer configurations are chosen with respect to the * boltzmann measure * defined as follows .",
    "suppose that the graph @xmath5 is finite , and that a positive weight function @xmath11 is assigned to edges of @xmath5 , then each dimer configuration @xmath12 has an _ energy _",
    ", @xmath13 .",
    "the probability of occurrence of the dimer configuration @xmath12 chosen with respect to the boltzmann measure @xmath14 is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normalizing constant called the * partition function*. using the bijection between dimer configurations and @xmath3-tilings , @xmath11 can be seen as weighting @xmath3-tiles , and @xmath14 as a measure on @xmath3-tilings of @xmath4 .",
    "when the graph @xmath5 is infinite , a * gibbs measure * is defined to be a probability measure on @xmath10 with the following property : if the matching in an annular region is fixed , then matchings inside and outside of the annulus are independent , moreover the probability of any interior matching @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath17 . from now on , let us assume that the graph @xmath4 satisfies condition @xmath18 below :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      this paper actually proves conformal invariance of the scaling limit for a sub - family of all dimer models called _ isoradial dimer models _ , introduced by kenyon in @xcite .",
    "much attention has lately been given to isoradial dimer models because of a surprising feature : many statistical mechanics quantities can be computed in terms of the _ local _ geometry of the graph .",
    "this fact was conjectured in @xcite , and proved in @xcite .",
    "the motivation for their study is further enhanced by the fact that the yet classical domino and @xmath2-rhombus tiling models are examples of isoradial dimer models .",
    "last but not least their understanding allows us to apprehend a random interface model in dimension @xmath1 called the _ triangular quadri - tiling model _ introduced in @xcite , see section [ subsubsec021].let us now define isoradial dimer models . speaking in the terminology of @xmath3-tilings , * isoradial @xmath3-tiling models * are defined on graphs @xmath4 satisfying a geometric condition called * isoradiality * : all faces of an isoradial graph are inscribable in a circle , and all circumcircles have the same radius , moreover all circumcenters of the faces are contained in the closure of the faces .",
    "the energy of configurations is determined by a specific weight function called the _ critical weight function _ , see section [ subsec11 ] for definition .",
    "note that if @xmath4 is an isoradial graph , an isoradial embedding of the dual graph @xmath5 is obtained by sending dual vertices to the center of the corresponding faces .",
    "hence , the corresponding dimer model is called an * isoradial dimer model*.      let @xmath4 be an isoradial graph , whose dual graph @xmath5 is bipartite . then , by means of the _ height function _ , @xmath3-tilings of @xmath4 can be interpreted as random discrete @xmath3-dimensional surfaces in a @xmath19-dimensional space that are projected orthogonally to the plane . in physics terminology ,",
    "one speaks of random interfaces in dimension @xmath20 .",
    "the height function , denoted by @xmath21 , is an @xmath22-valued function on the vertices of every @xmath3-tiling of @xmath4 , and is defined in section [ sec2 ] .      the gaussian free field in the plane is defined in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "it is a random distribution which assigns to functions @xmath23 ( the set of compactly supported smooth functions of @xmath24 , which have mean @xmath25 ) , a real gaussian random vector @xmath26 whose covariance function is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the green function of the plane ( defined up to an additive constant ) .",
    "the gaussian free field is conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be an isoradial graph , whose dual graph @xmath5 is bipartite .",
    "suppose moreover that @xmath5 is doubly periodic , i.e. that the graph @xmath5 and its vertex - coloring are periodic .",
    "then by sheffield s theorem @xcite , there exists a two - parameter family of translation invariant , ergodic gibbs measures ; let us denote by @xmath29 the unique measure which has minimal free energy per fundamental domain . from now on , we assume that dimer configurations of @xmath5 are chosen with respect to the measure @xmath29.let us multiply the edge - lengths of the graph @xmath4 by @xmath30 , this yields a new graph @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 be the unnormalized height function on @xmath3-tilings of @xmath31 .",
    "an important issue in the study of the dimer model is the understanding of the fluctuations of @xmath32 , as the mesh @xmath33 tends to @xmath25 .",
    "this question is answered by theorem [ thm1 ] below .",
    "define : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the set of vertices of the graph @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the area in @xmath5 of the dual face @xmath38 of a vertex @xmath39 .",

    "@xmath47 as a direct consequence of theorem [ thm1 ] , we obtain convergence of the height function of domino and @xmath2-rhombus tilings chosen with respect to the uniform measure to a gaussian free field . note",
    "that this result is slightly different than those of @xcite since we work on the whole plane , and not on simply connected regions.@xmath47 the method for proving theorem [ thm1 ] is essentially that of @xcite , except lemma [ lem59 ] which is new .",
    "nevertheless , since we work with a general isoradial graph ( and not the square lattice ) , each step is adapted in a non trivial way .        an exciting consequence of theorem [ thm1 ] is that it allows us to understand height fluctuations in the case of a random interface model in dimension @xmath1 , called the _",

    "color the vertex at the right angle black , and the other two vertices white . a * quadri - tile * is a quadrilateral obtained from two such triangles in two different ways : either glue them along a leg of the same length matching the black ( white ) vertex to the black ( white ) one , or glue them along the hypotenuse",
