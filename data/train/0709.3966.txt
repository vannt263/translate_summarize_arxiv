    "in microfluidic systems boundary effects are significantly more important because of the large surface to volume ratio .",
    "the influence of the surface topologies and wetting behavior on the fluid flow is an important issue in the context of microfluidics and can not be neglected , since a flat non - interacting surface is always an idealization . in this paper",
    "we utilize lattice boltzmann simulations to investigate the combined influence of roughness and wettability on the fluid flow . in the past the influence of roughens",
    "was mainly investigated in the context of ( turbulent ) boundary layer theory .",
    "already in the 1930s nikuradse performed experiments with sand glued inside a pipe in order to obtain the so called skin friction coefficient , which is still commonly used in engineering applications  @xcite . until today",
    ", every known theory describing general rough surfaces requires at least one empirical parameter to describe the shape of the surface  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the question which boundary condition has to be applied at a surface . for more than a hundred years",
    "the no - slip boundary condition was successfully applied in engineering applications .",
    "nevertheless , navier  @xcite introduced a slip boundary condition @xmath0 saying that the fluid velocity @xmath1 at the boundary @xmath2 is proportional to the velocity gradient @xmath3 .",
    "the constant of proportionality is given by the slip length @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 depends on many parameters like the wettability , the surface roughness or fluid properties like the viscosity or molecular interactions .",
    "therefore it has to be seen as an empirical length that contains many to some extent unknown interactions .",
    "however , for simple liquids the measured slip lengths are commonly of the order of up to some tens of nanometers .",
    "the influence of roughness on the slip length @xmath4 has been investigated by numerous authors .",
    "on the one hand roughness leads to higher drag forces and thus to no - slip on macroscopic scales .",
    "richardson showed that even if on a rough surface a full - slip boundary condition is applied , one can determine a flow speed reduction near the boundary resulting in a macroscopic no - slip assumption  @xcite .",
    "this was experimentally demonstrated by mchale and newton  @xcite .",
    "jansons has shown analytically that even few perturbations on flat surfaces lead to mesoscopic slip  @xcite and therefore macroscopically to no - slip . on the other hand , roughness can cause pockets to be filled with vapor or gas nano bubbles leading to apparent slip  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "performed molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of couette flow between sinusoidal walls and found that slip appears for roughness amplitudes smaller than the molecular length scale  @xcite .",
    "for the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces which are reducing the drag enormously , it is essential that there are variations in the surface height  @xcite .",
    "varnik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method to show that even in small geometries rough channel surfaces can cause flow to become turbulent .",
    "recently , sbragaglia _ et al .",
    "_ applied the lb method to simulate fluids in the vicinity of microstructured hydrophobic surfaces  @xcite . in an approach similar to the one proposed in this paper , they modeled a liquid - vapor transition at the surface utilizing the shan - chen multiphase lb model  @xcite .",
    "the authors were able to reproduce the behavior of the capillary pressure as simulated by cottin - bizonne _ et al .",
    "_ using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "they further showed that hydrophobic rough surfaces increase the mass flow which corresponds to an apparent slip effect and that there exists a `` critical roughness '' at which superhydrophobic effects appear .",
    "a common setup to measure slip is to utilize a modified atomic force microscope ( afm ) to oscillate a colloidal sphere in the vicinity of a boundary  @xcite . in these measurements",
    "the drag force is measured by the afm and compared with the theoretical values . by applying the theory of o.i .",
    "vinogradova to quantify the force correction needed one can find the corresponding slip length @xmath4 @xcite . here",
    "the distance between sphere and wall becomes very small .",
    "therefore a correct knowledge of the boundaries properties is very important .",
    "vinogradova and yakubov demonstrated that assuming a wrong position of the surface during measurements can lead to substantial errors in the determined slip lengths  @xcite .",
    "they showed that measurements can be interpreted by assuming a modified boundary position instead of navier s slip condition , so that the position of a no - slip wall would be between peaks and valleys of the rough surface . in this paper",
    "we follow this idea .",
    "we answer the question at which distinct position the `` effective boundary '' has to be placed and study the influence of a wrongly determined wall position numerically .    in previous papers we presented a model to simulate hydrophobic surfaces with a shan - chen based fluid - surface interaction and investigated the behavior of the slip length @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we showed that the slip length @xmath4 is independent of the shear rate , but depends on the pressure and on the concentration of surfactant added .",
    "recently , we presented the idea of an effective wall for rough channel surfaces  @xcite .",
    "we investigated the influence of different types of roughness on the position of the effective boundary . in this paper",
    "we show how the effective boundary depends on the distribution of the roughness elements and how roughness and hydrophobicity interact with each other .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction we shortly present the simulation technique and the simulated system .",
    "we give an overview on the analytical results of panzer and liu  @xcite which can be compared to our simulations .",
    "then we present new results on flow among gaussian distributed roughness and the correlation between non - wetting and roughness .",
    "we close with a conclusion and summary of our results .",
    "we use a 3d lb model as presented in  @xcite to simulate pressure driven flow between two infinite rough walls that might be wetting or non - wetting .",
    "previously , we applied the method to study flows of simple fluids and complex mixtures containing surfactant in hydrophobic microchannels  @xcite .",
    "since the method is well described in the literature we only shortly describe it here .    the lattice boltzmann equation , @xmath5 with the components @xmath6 , 1 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , describes the time evolution of the single - particle distribution @xmath9 , indicating the amount of quasi particles with velocity @xmath10 , at site @xmath11 on a 3d lattice of coordination number @xmath12 , at time - step @xmath13 .",

    "the wall properties are given by the so - called wall density @xmath22 .",
    "this enters directly into the effective mass @xmath23 , with the normalized mass @xmath24 .",
    "with such a model we can simulate slip flow over hydrophobic boundaries with a slip length @xmath4 of up to @xmath25 in lattice units  @xcite .",
    "higher slip lengths are not easy to realize since the pressure difference between the bulk and at the vicinity of the boundary becomes too large leading to instabilities .",
    "it was shown that this slip length is independent of the shear rate , but depends on the interaction parameters and on the pressure .    in this paper we model poiseuille flow between two infinite rough boundaries .",
    "simulation lattices are 512 lattice units long in flow direction and the planes are separated by 128 sites between the lowest points of the roughness elements @xmath26 .",

    "set to 0 we obtain the no - slip case . the viscosity @xmath32 and the pressure gradient @xmath33 are given by the simulation . to obtain an average value for @xmath34 ,",
    "a sufficient number of individual profiles at different positions @xmath35 are taken into account .",
    "alternatively , the mass flow @xmath36 can be computed to obtain @xmath37 .",
    "both methods are equivalent and produce identical results .",
    "@xmath34 gives the position of the effective boundary .",
    "the effective height @xmath38 of the rough surface measured from the minimum height @xmath26 is then defined by @xmath39 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hydrodynamicwall ] ) .",
    "panzer _ et al . _  calculated the slip length @xmath4 analytically for poiseuille flow with rough walls by performing a fourier expansion of the streaming function @xmath40 containing the solution of the navier - stokes equations in the laminar case  @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 is obtained by a fourier expansion of the boundary surface and of the pressure field and its solution contains information of an effective boundary .",
    "the problem of such an approach is that it works only for small wave numbers .",
    "one would have to take into account an infinite number of terms to achieve a result for arbitrary geometries .",

    "[ eq : panzer ] .",
    "our simulations do not suffer from such limitations allowing us to study arbitrarily complex surface geometries  @xcite .",
    "we showed in a recent paper @xcite that the position of the effective boundary height is depending on the shape of the roughness elements , i.e. , for strong surface distortions it is between @xmath56 and @xmath57 times the average height of the roughness @xmath29 . by adding an additional distance between roughness elements",
    ", @xmath38 decreases slowly , so that the maximum height is still the leading parameter .",
    "we are also able to simulate flow over surfaces generated from afm data of gold coated glass used in microflow experiments by o.i .",
    "vinogradova and g.e .",
    "yakubov @xcite .",
    "we find that the height distribution of such a surface is gaussian and that a randomly arranged surface with a similar distribution gives the same result for the position of the effective boundary although in this case the heights are not correlated . to generate this height distribution we use a gaussian distributed random height for every lattice point on the surface obtained from a box - mller based algorithm @xcite .",
    "we can set the width of the distribution @xmath58 and the average height @xmath28 . by scaling @xmath58 with @xmath28",
    "we obtain geometrically similar geometries .",
    "this similarity is important because the effective height @xmath38 scales with the average roughness in the case of geometrical similarity @xcite . as an extension of our previous work , we investigate gaussian distributed heights with different widths @xmath58 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : grandom01 ] the effective height @xmath59 is plotted over the average height @xmath28 for @xmath60 .",

    "we find that the effective height @xmath38 can be fitted by @xmath61 the range of distributions is limited by the resolution of the lattice .",
    "if @xmath58 becomes too small , the surface is nearly a flat wall , while a too large @xmath58 leads to a porous medium instead of a channel . in order to perform simulations much larger simulation volumes",
    "are needed in the considered case .",
    "the effective height @xmath38 ranges from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "these values are lower than the effective heights for an equally distributed roughness ( @xmath64 ) . we have found in our previous study that experimentally available surfaces commonly have gaussian distributed roughness .",
    "therefore , our results shown here can help to estimate @xmath38 in real microchannels .",
    "next we investigate how roughness and the surface wettability act together .",
    "therefore we perform simulations with rough channels to which we assign a fluid - wall interaction as given in the introduction ( [ eq : force ] ) .",
    "for @xmath22 we choose @xmath65 , @xmath48 , and @xmath25 .",
    "for these values and perfectly smooth surfaces we determine the slip length @xmath4 to be @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as roughness",
    "we choose an equally distributed roughness so that @xmath29 . in order to obtain better results we average the values obtained from four different seeds of the random number generator .",
    "the seed determines the sequence of random numbers and therefore the shape of the boundary , by leaving the averaged parameters constant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : crandom01 ] we plot the effective height of rough hydrophobic walls versus the average roughness @xmath28 . for @xmath69",
    "we find a linear dependence between the average roughness @xmath28 and the effective height @xmath38 .",
    "the interesting point is that the slope for different @xmath22 is different .",
    "that means that the fluid - surface interaction dose not cause a simple offset on the effective height @xmath38 but that a non linear effect is observed .    to decouple the effect of roughness and wettability we determine the slip length by setting the effective distance @xmath34 in equation ( [ eq : profil02 ] ) to the effective distance for a rough no - slip wall",
    "we then fit the corresponding velocity profile via @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : crandom02 ] we can see that the slip length @xmath4 for the strong fluid - wall interaction ( @xmath70 ) first decreases with the average roughness and then raises . for a lower interaction , the slip length is constantly growing and leads to an increase of the slip length for weak fluid wall interaction ( @xmath71 ) by a factor of more than three .",
    "there are two contradicting effects in this system and their interplay can explain the observed behavior .",
    "the decrease of the slip length @xmath4 is due to an increased friction near the boundary at moderate roughness .",
    "the increase has its reason in the reduced pressure near the hydrophobic rough surface , so that the fluid `` feels '' a smoothed effective surface . unlike the implementation of sbragaglia _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite our model is not able to model the liquid - gas transition near the surface .",
    "we only find a density difference between the bulk fluid and the lattice site just next to the surface .",
    "therefore , we can not easily calculate the contact angle in our simulations  @xcite . however , the general effect of a pressure drop near a hydrophobic surface is the same as in the model used in  @xcite . for a more detailed study on superhydrophobic surfaces , the strong surface variation as well as",
    "the liquid - gas transitions have to be taken into account .",
    "this is planned as a future project and beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to demonstrate the effect of the pure fluid - surface interaction as it is discussed here .",
    "in conclusion we performed lb simulations of pressure driven flow between two rough plates with and without hydrophobic fluid - wall interaction .",
    "we could show that the effective height scales linearly with the width of the distribution @xmath58 , so that the effective height is @xmath72 .    for rough surfaces with a hydrophobic fluid - wall interaction , we could show that there exists a strong non - linear effect that leads to an increase of the slip length @xmath4 by a factor of three for small interactions .",
    "the behavior of the slip length can only be explained as a coupled effect since the pure roughness and the pure hydrophobic interaction were investigated in previous studies . for further investigations of super hydrophobicity",
    "a phase transition model would be needed .",
