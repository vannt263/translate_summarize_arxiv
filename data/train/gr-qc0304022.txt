    "several large scale interferometric instruments are being commissioned  @xcite or have started science runs  @xcite , aiming at the detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted by astrophysical sources .",
    "the interferometers are sensible in a relatively wide frequency band , which makes it possible to resolve the structure of short bursts of gw , like those emitted during the type ii supernova explosions , or the merger phase in the binary black - holes coalescence ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    however it has been frequently argued  @xcite that the knowledge of the burst waveforms is rather poor , and therefore the classical wiener filtering may be not applicable : in this context , it is advisable to develop methods which do not rely on the theoretical signal waveform ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "one of us ( a.v . ) has proposed in  @xcite one such method , which is claimed to be `` optimal '' under the assumptions that only the duration of the burst is known , and that the detector noise is gaussian , but not necessarily white .    in",
    "@xcite the method has been derived from those assumptions , and an algorithm has been defined that we will call `` generalized delta filtering '' ( gdf ) , because it reduces itself to a @xmath0-filtering when its `` window size '' parameter is chosen to be @xmath1 . in that paper",
    "no test was made to assess the actual detection performance of the gdf .    in the present work",
    "we have made such a test , using simulated waveforms  @xcite and the expected virgo spectral noise density  @xcite .",
    "referring to  @xcite for details about the method and its derivation , we just recall that in the single detector case it amounts to apply a few simple analysis steps :    1 .   a @xmath0-filtering step , also called _ double whitening _",
    "@xcite , which can be implemented in the frequency domain dividing the fourier transform ( ft ) of the signal by the estimated spectral noise density ; 2 .",
    "estimate the _ discrete karhounen - love _",
    "basis for a window of fixed size @xmath2 of the @xmath0-filtered data ; we recall that the dkl basis is a set of @xmath2 vectors which `` diagonalize '' the input noise , in the sense that coefficients @xmath3 of the decomposition of data @xmath4 over the basis are statistically independent , that is @xmath5\\propto\\delta_{kl}$ ]  @xcite ; 3 .",
    "slide the window over the available @xmath0-filtered data and compute the statistic @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dkl basis ; 4 .",
    "select candidates by comparing the data against a threshold @xmath9 .",
    "the only parameter of the algorithm is the window size @xmath2 , and possibly the stride used in sliding the window over the @xmath0-filtered data .",
    "we have used `` standard '' virgo noise  @xcite , as modeled on the basis of the expected noise sources  @xcite , including the thermal and shot noise in the frequency band @xmath10$]hz .    to generate noisy data , we started from white gaussian noise , `` colored '' on the basis of the virgo sensitivity curve .",
    "in the lower part , the expected spectral noise density of the virgo detector is shown , superimposed to an example of spectrum obtained on simulated data . in the upper part , an example of noisy output",
    "is plotted in the time domain.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we show in figure  [ fig : virgonoise ] an example of the simulated noise obtained using this procedure .",
    "also the resulting spectrum is shown , superimposed to the `` theoretical '' spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that the simulated data include the effect of the narrow resonances corresponding to the suspension `` violin modes '' : it is yet not completely clear if these resonances will be filtered out before applying the detection algorithms , and we have chosen not to remove them .      as prototype gw signals",
    ", we have used waveforms resulting from simulations of the core - collapse of type ii supernovae made by zwerger and mller  @xcite .",
    "these waveforms are labeled by the values of the parameters @xmath11 which enter in the polytropic equation of state of the nuclear matter .",
    "our method is not optimal in the wiener sense , and therefore it is crucial to set the scale of the signals in the simulations .",
    "we have chosen to normalize all the signals to the same _ intrinsic _ signal to noise ratio , defined as usual by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the one - sided spectral density of the noise , and @xmath14 is the ft of the signal considered .",
    "in our simulations we have set @xmath15 to compare with the results in  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to have a first exploratory look at the results of a gdf analysis performed as in section  [ sec : method ] .     in anti - clockwise sense : simulated signal+noise , signal only , output of a @xmath0-filtering step , output of a gdf analysis using an @xmath16 window.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : example ] we show what happens with an @xmath16 window , choosing a zwerger - mller ( zm ) signal with a rather short duration , and very much like an instantaneous burst . in this case , the outputs of both the @xmath0-filtering and the gdf analysis put clearly in evidence the event occurrence .     in anti - clockwise sense :",
    "simulated signal+noise , signal only , output of a @xmath0-filtering step , output of a gdf analysis using an @xmath17 window.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : example2 ] we choose a signal having a more complicated time - domain evolution : in this case , the @xmath0-filtering is unable to capture the event , but a gdf analysis using an @xmath17 window appears instead to put it in evidence , although other false alarms appear in the same time window , whose significance remains to be assessed .",
    "these examples are just indications that the method works : for a quantitative understanding we need to estimate the receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that the statistical properties of the gdf detector can be assessed analytically , because the statistic in equation  [ eq : statistic ] is just a @xmath18 with @xmath2 degrees of freedom .    in presence of a signal ,",
    "the statistic is a non - central @xmath18 , and its distribution is  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "the distribution @xmath21 depends only on the @xmath22 of the signal , as seen by the gdf method .",
    "note that this @xmath22 has nothing to do with the @xmath23 , and it is defined as customary by the ratio @xmath24-e\\left[l|h_{0}\\right]}{\\sqrt{e\\left[\\left(l - e\\left[l|h_{0}\\right]\\right)^{2}|h_{0}\\right]}}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the hypotheses of absence or presence of a signal , respectively . using this definition it is immediate to show that @xmath27 for the gdf statistic .    in order to estimate false alarms and detection probabilities ,",
    "we need therefore first to compute how much @xmath22 is collected by the gdf detector(s ) , for a fixed @xmath23 .",
    "we have considered the 78 signals in the zm family  @xcite , normalized w.r.t . the theoretical virgo noise to have @xmath28 , and we have computed for each of them the @xmath22 resulting from a gdf analysis , using different values of the window size @xmath2 . we stress that there is no point in comparing the values of @xmath22 for different detection methods or different window sizes @xmath2 : only the comparison of false alarm and detection probabilities is sensible .     the distribution of @xmath22 for different values of the @xmath2 parameter of the gdf algorithm , based on zm input signals normalized to have @xmath28,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we show in figure  [ fig : snrdistribution ] the resulting @xmath22 distributions .",
    "starting from the distribution in equation  [ eq : distribution ] it is immediate to derive the false alarm probability @xmath29 while the detection probability @xmath30 can be evaluated by a numerical integral .",
    "we stress that these @xmath31 are `` per bin '' , namely they do not take into account the auto - correlation of the filter outputs , which would require to resample the output or to select , among the outputs above threshold , only the maxima over a fixed time window , whose length would be another parameter of the algorithm .    for a given signal ,",
    "we have varied the threshold @xmath9 to obtain @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 , and for each value of @xmath9 we have averaged the probabilities over the different zm waveforms ; the resulting plot of @xmath32 against @xmath33 constitutes the average roc curve , that we show in figure  [ fig : rocmean ] for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "the roc curves obtained averaging over the 78 waveforms of the zm family ( see text ) , for different window sizes @xmath2,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the similarity of the plots may lead to argue that the window size is not very important . actually this is just an effect of the averaging , as indicated by the examples in figures  [ fig : example ] and  [ fig : example2 ] , which show that one should better match the signal length and the window size @xmath2 .",
    "the best and worst cases of the roc curves , obtained over the different zm waveforms , for two different values of the @xmath2 parameter . note that the horizontal scale is different from the one used in figure  [ fig : rocmean],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this is confirmed in figure  [ fig : rocminmax ] , where we plot the best and worst roc curve obtained over the 78 zm signals , for two different values ( 4 and 32 ) of the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "the large dispersion of the results is a consequence of the large differences of the snr recovered by the gdf filters over the various waveforms , as displayed in figure  [ fig : snrdistribution ] .",
    "in this paper we have started to assess the detection capabilities of the `` generalized delta filtering '' introduced by one of us in  @xcite , by computing the receiver operating characteristics in the case of virgo simulated noise , using signals from the zwerger - mller family .",
    "the roc curves we obtain are generally inferior to those obtained by some other burst detection methods  @xcite ; however we should mention that in  @xcite a white gaussian noise was used , a difference with our computations whose relevance we are unable to assess .",
    "the results show a wide variation over the @xmath2 parameter , and suggest that further optimization is possible : one should define a bank of filters with different @xmath2 values and understand how to combine the various outputs and how to select candidates . as discussed in section  [ sec : fadp ] one should take into account the fact that the filter outputs are correlated , and that one may strongly decrease the false alarm probability by re - sampling the output at a lower rate , while probably not hampering too much the detection probability .",
    "these studies are beyond the scope of the present work and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
