    "exactly solvable models play an exceptional role in physics .",
    "they are simple enough to be solvable , yet sufficiently complicated to grab the essence of physical reality . in quantum mechanics , exact solvability usually means that the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian can be found explicitly . they can be computed analytically by solving directly corresponding differential equations .",
    "alternatively , they can be obtained in algebraic manner with the use of the integrals of motion ; when the symmetries of the quantum system form lie algebra , the spectrum and eigenstates of the energy operator can be deduced from the analysis of the admissible unitary representations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the symmetry operators preserve domain of the hamiltonian by transforming one physical state into another .",
    "when they are time - dependent , they do not commute with the energy operator and , hence , they do not preserve energy .",
    "the associated algebra of the integrals of motion is called dynamical or spectrum generating ; see @xcite , @xcite . when the integrals of motion commute with the hamiltonian , they rather reflect spectral degeneracy of the system .",
    "the algebraic structure , where the hamiltonian plays the role of central element , is denoted as potential algebra . in the current article , we will focus on the analysis and applications of the potential algebras of the relativistic quantum systems described by the @xmath3 dimensional dirac equation .",
    "the low - dimensional dirac equation appears in surprising variety of physical settings that are studied both in quantum field theory and in the condensed matter physics .",
    "let us mention the @xmath5 dimensional variant of the famous nambu - jona - lasinio ( chiral gross - neveu ) model @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , analysis of fractionally charged solitons @xcite , @xcite as well as description of inhomogeneous superconductors @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , @xcite , or linear molecules like polyacetylene @xcite .",

    "the work is organized as follows : in the next section , the potential algebras are constructed for a separable dirac - like operator with the use of a specific ansatz for both the ladder operators and for the structure of the algebra .",
    "relevant aspects of the representations based on the lowest / highest weight vectors are discussed in more detail , as well as the application of the algebraic structure in description of dirac fermions in the curved space .",
    "the results are used directly in the third section , where solvable models describing low - energy charge carriers on the surface of open - cage fullerenes are analyzed .",
    "two configurations are considered , with one and two holes in the surface of the crystal .    in the fourth section ,",
    "we apply the potential algebras in construction of one - dimensional shape - invariant systems .",
    "first , we focus on the shape - invariance of one - dimensional dirac hamiltonians and show that it is associated with @xmath4 nonlinear supersymmetry , generated by both local and non - local supercharges .",
    "we also discuss how is the relation of this framework with the known , non - relativistic shape - invariant hamiltonians . in this context , we consider superalgebraic structure associated with the nonrelativistic shape - invariant systems whose supercharges are shape - invariant themselves .",
