    "the observed eccentricities of extra - solar planets can be readily explained by a simple model that assumes that virtually all planetary systems undergo dynamical instabilities ( ford 2003 ; adams & laughlin 2003 ; chatterjee 2008 ; juric & tremaine 2008 ; ford & rasio 2008 ) . in the context of this model , planetary systems",
    "are expected to form in marginally stable configurations , meaning that they are stable for at least the timescale of rapid gas accretion of @xmath0 years ( pollack 1996 ) but ultimately unstable , probably on a timescale comparable to the gaseous disk s lifetime of @xmath1 years ( haisch 2001 ) .",
    "this instability timescale implies an initial separation between planets of perhaps 4 - 5 mutual hill radii @xmath2 , where @xmath3^{1/3}$ ] ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the orbital distances , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of two adjacent planets , and @xmath8 is the stellar mass ( chambers 1996 ; marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ; chatterjee 2008 ) .",
    "are close to the 3:2 and 2:1 mean motion resonances .",
    "thus , an alternate argument in favor of planets forming with such spacings invokes resonant capture ( snellgrove 2001 ) followed by turbulent removal from resonance ( adams 2008 ) during the gaseous disk phase . ] after a delay of @xmath9 years , a typical system of three or more planets with separations of @xmath10 becomes unstable , leading to close encounters between two planets , strong dynamical scattering , and eventual destruction of one or two planets by either collision with another planet , collision with the star , or , most probably , hyperbolic ejection from the system ( rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; lin & ida 1997 ; papaloizou & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "it is the planets that _ survive _ the dynamical instability that provide a match to the observed extra - solar eccentricities .",
    "additional dynamical information can be obtained from the known extra - solar multiple planet systems . in particular ,",
    "the stability in two - planet systems can be guaranteed for planets with particular masses and orbital configurations .",
    "the edge of stability can be quantified in terms of the proximity to the analytically - derived hill stability limit using the dimensionless quantity @xmath11 ( the stability boundary is located at @xmath12 ; see section 3 ) .",
    "dynamical analyses have shown that the known multiple - planet systems are clustered just beyond the edge of stability ( i.e. , at @xmath13 ; barnes & quinn 2004 ; barnes & greenberg 2006 , 2007 ) .    in this paper we study the stability of the surviving planets in several thousand 3-planet systems that have undergone planet - planet scattering leading to the loss of one planet .",
    "we find that in the aftermath of dynamical instabilities , the surviving planets cluster just beyond the stability boundary , providing a good match to the observed values .",
    "this provides support for planet - planet scattering as an active process in extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "this result also has consequences for the packing of planetary systems and the `` packed planetary systems '' hypothesis ( barnes & raymond 2004 ; raymond & barnes 2005 ; raymond 2006 ; barnes 2008 ) . the paper proceeds as follows : we describe our scattering simulations (  2 ) , summarize hill stability theory and define @xmath11 (  3 ) , present our results (  4 ) and discuss the consequences (  5 ) .",
    "our scattering simulations are drawn from the same sample as in raymond ( 2008a ) .",
    "each simulation started with three planets randomly separated by 4 - 5 mutual hill radii .",
    "the three planets were placed such that the outermost planet was located two ( linear ) hill radii @xmath14 interior to 10 au ( @xmath15^{1/3}$ ] ) .",
    "we performed ten sets of simulations , varying the planetary mass distribution . for our two largest sets ( 1000 simulations each ) we randomly selected planet masses according to the observed distribution of exoplanet masses : @xmath16 ( butler 2006 ) . in the mixed1 set we restricted the planet mass @xmath17 to be between a saturn mass @xmath18 and three jupiter masses @xmath19 . for our mixed2 set ,",
    "the minimum planet mass was decreased to 10 @xmath20 .",
    "we also performed four meq sets ( 500 simulations each ) with equal mass planets for @xmath21 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the mgrad sets ( 250 simulations each ) contained radial gradients in @xmath17 . for the jsn set , in order of increasing orbital distance , @xmath17 = @xmath19 , @xmath18 , and @xmath23 . for the nsj set ,",
    "these masses were reversed ,",
    "i.e. , the @xmath19 planet was the most distant .",
    "the 3jjs and sj3j sets had , in increasing radial distance , @xmath17 = @xmath22 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 , and @xmath17 = @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "planetary orbits were given zero eccentricity and mutual inclinations of less than 1 degree .",
    "each simulation was integrated for 100 myr with the hybrid _ mercury _ integrator ( chambers 1999 ) using a 20 day timestep .",
    "we required that all simulations conserve energy to better than @xmath24 , which is needed to accurately test for stability ( barnes & quinn 2004 ) .",
    "we achieved this by reducing the timestep to 5 days for simulations with @xmath25 and then removing simulations that still conserved energy poorly . as expected , these systems were typically unstable on @xmath9 year timescales .",
    "in addition , about 1/4 of simulations were stable for 100 myr which shows that we started close to the stability boundary . for this paper ,",
    "we restrict our analysis to the subsample of simulations that 1 ) were unstable , and 2 ) contained two planets on stable orbits after 100 myr ( i.e. , one and only one planet was destroyed ) .",
    "for the case of two planets with masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbiting a star , dynamical stability is guaranteed if : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the total orbital angular momentum and energy of the system , respectively ( marchal & bozis 1982 ; gladman 1993 ; veras & armitage 2004 ; note that this definition assumes that @xmath29 ) .",
    "we refer to the left side of eqn 1 as @xmath30 and the right side as @xmath31 ( barnes & greenberg 2006 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 therefore measures the proximity of a pair of orbits to the hill stability limit of @xmath32 .",
    "we note that our @xmath11 analysis only applies for two - planet non - resonant systems , because perturbations from additional companions can shift the stability boundary to values other than 1 ( barnes & greenberg 2007 ) .    when calculating @xmath11 for extra - solar systems , past research ( barnes & greenberg 2006 , 2007 ) has assumed coplanar orbits with masses equal to minimum masses .",
    "those values of @xmath11 were systematically affected by the mass - inclination degeneracy , probably resulting in overestimations .",
    "in contrast , our simulations provide the full three - dimensional orbits , and hence we can calculate the true value of @xmath11 . more importantly , if we assume that viewing geometries are distributed isotropically ( i.e. edge - on systems are more likely than face - on ) , we can determine how @xmath11 would be calculated from radial velocity data ( e.g. assuming coplanar , edge - on orbits ) .",
    "for example , if two planets with masses @xmath33 and @xmath34 have inclinations ( relative to their invariable plane ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and the inclination to the line of sight is @xmath37 , then the `` observed '' @xmath11 would use masses @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in ",
    "4 we use this approach to build a distribution of @xmath11 that is directly comparable to the actual distribution ( and effectively break the mass - inclination degeneracy ) .",
    "we generated @xmath11 distributions from our simulations following the procedure described above .",
    "first , we `` observed '' each system from 100 viewing angles , thereby decreasing the inferred mass of each planet by a factor of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 refers to each planet s inclination with respect to a fiducial plane .",
    "second , we assumed the observed systems to be coplanar in calculating @xmath11 for each viewing angle using eqn 1 .",
    "finally , we included the @xmath11 calculated for each viewing angle by assuming the viewing angle @xmath37 to be isotropically distributed .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdist ] compares the cumulative @xmath11 distributions for the observed two - planet systems with our scattering simulations .",
    "it is important to note that the `` true '' @xmath11 distributions , calculated with knowledge of the simulated systems real masses and inclinations , are virtually identical to the curves from fig .",
    "[ fig : bdist ] ( this issue is discussed further in  5 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the extra - solar systems in our analysis ; we excluded systems with controversial or poorly - characterized orbits and those that were likely affected by tidal effects . in a two planet system with an inner planet at @xmath42",
    "au , tides will decrease the inner planet s eccentricity and semimajor axis ( jackson 2008 ) , thereby increasing the separation between the two planets and @xmath11 .",
    "four individual cases  mixed1 , mixed2 , meq:@xmath43 , and meq:@xmath44  each provide a match to the observed @xmath11 distribution .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov",
    "( k - s ) tests show that the probability @xmath45 that the @xmath11 distributions from those four cases are drawn from the same distribution as the observed sample are all 0.1 or larger ( table 2 ) .",
    "the distribution calculated by an unweighted combination of all ten cases is also a good match ( each case was given equal weight , regardless of the number of simulations ) .",

    "systems with @xmath53 are unusual because they lie within the formal hill stability boundary but are stabilized by special orbital configurations .",
    "in fact , all five of the known exoplanet systems with @xmath54 are thought to lie in mean motion resonances ( table 1 ) .",
    "the scattered systems with @xmath53 are stabilized by resonances or in many cases by low - amplitude , aligned apsidal libration .",

    "we attribute the lack of a correlation between resonances and @xmath53 to the relative weakness of these resonances .",
    "indeed , resonances caused by scattering tend to exhibit relatively high - amplitude libration of only one resonant argument ( raymond 2008a ) ; these resonances have typical @xmath11 values of slightly more than 1 ( median @xmath56 for the different cases ) .",
    "this contrasts with resonances generated by convergent migration in gaseous disks , which tend to exhibit low amplitude libration of more than one resonant argument ( snellgrove 2001 ; lee & peale 2002 ) .",
