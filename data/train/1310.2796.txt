    "quasi - periodic pulsations ( qpp ) in the emission generated in solar flares , with the periods ranging from a fraction of second to several minutes , have been intensively studied for several decades ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "one of the possibilities opened up by revealing the nature of qpp in flares is the diagnostics of physical conditions in flaring sites and mechanisms operating in them .",
    "moreover , this diagnostics can be extended to stellar flares , which are also observed to have qpp in their radio , optical and soft x - ray light curves .",
    "the origin of the qpp is still not clear , while it is accepted that they can be produced by several mechanisms . perhaps , one of the most understood possibility is the generation of qpp by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) oscillations of coronal structures .",
    "coronal mhd oscillations are well seen in various bands directly with the modern high time and spatial resolution instruments , which provide researchers with the ground for their identification in the flaring emission .",
    "standing longitudinal oscillations of coronal loops were first detected as the periodic doppler shift of the emission lines fexix and fexxi , with the formation temperature greater than 6 mk , with the soho / sumer instrument (; ) .",
    "the mean observed oscillation period is 17.6@xmath05.4 min .",
    "the oscillations are strongly damped , with the damping time about one period of the oscillation . in some cases ,",
    "the intensity oscillations are seen .",
    "there is a quarter - period phase lag between the intensity and the doppler shift oscillations .",
    "the oscillations are usually observed in association with the soft x - ray brightenings , sometimes up to the m - class flares @xcite .",
    "similar doppler - shift oscillations during solar flares in emission lines of sxv and caxix , with the formation temperature 1214 mk , with yohkoh / bcs were reported by @xcite . in cooler coronal emission lines , similar oscillations were detected with hinode / eis @xcite .    the compressible nature of the longitudinal oscillations and their long periods led to their interpretation in terms of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations damped because of high thermal conduction @xcite .",
    "a series of numerical studies , accounting for various additional physical effects including viscosity , 2d and 3d geometry , stratification , nonlinear steepening and mode coupling , demonstrated the robustness of this interpretation .",
    "in particular , the simulations showed that , depending upon whether the oscillations are triggered at one or both footpoints of a coronal loop , the fundamental mode and its second spatial harmonics can be effectively excited .",
    "the modes have different structure of the oscillations at the loop apex : in the fundamental mode there is a node of the density perturbation and the maximum of the field - aligned velocity perturbation at the apex , while it is the other way around in the second harmonics .",
    "the phase speed of the longitudinal waves is the tube speed @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the sound and alfvn speeds , respectively .",
    "the tube speed is subsonic and sub - alfvnic . in a low - beta plasma",
    "the tube speed is just slightly lower than the sound speed , while in the case @xmath4 the tube speed decreases to about @xmath5 . with the decrease in the alfvn speed",
    "@xmath6 the tube speed remains lower than the alfvn speed .",
    "slow magnetoacoustic oscillations can be also observed in the non - thermal emission of solar and stellar flares .",
    "the possible mechanisms are the periodic triggering of magnetic reconnection by the modulation of the physical conditions in the vicinity of the reconnection site @xcite , the modification of the spectral maximum of the gyrosynchrotron emission in the regime of the razin suppression because of the periodic modulation of the electron plasma frequency , and the direct modulation of the emission intensity because of the change of the concentration of the emitting plasma .",
    "however , so far these theoretical possibilities have been without observational confirmation . in this letter",
    ", we demonstrate , for the first time , the presence of longitudinal oscillations in the free - free microwave emission in a solar flare .",
    "we have examined the flare loops produced by a m1.6 flare which occurs at south - east limb on 2010 nov 4th . for this study , we used 17 ghz and 34 ghz data observed with nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; @xcite ) and 335   euv data observed with atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) onboard solar dynamics observatory .",
    "microwave data has a spatial resolution of 10  and a time cadence of 10 seconds .",
    "aia data has a spatial resolution of 1.2  and a 12 seconds time cadence .",
    "aia 335   channel contains a contribution from fexvi with the peak forming temperature of 2.5 mk for the flare @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows time profiles of the flare in soft x - rays taken with goes satellite ( top ) and radio fluxes at 17 and 34 ghz ( bottom ) .",
    "the flare starts at 23:55 , peaks at 23:57 ut , and then gradually decays .",
    "the fluxes at 17 and 34 ghz vary with same pattern during flare process but the difference of scale between them clearly changes as follows : for the flare peak , 17 ghz flux is larger than 34 ghz and then decrease less than 34 ghz , and finally both fluxes become comparable with each others .",
    "it implies that only in the flare peak the radio emission is generated by gyrosynchroton motion of accelerated electrons , while in the long decay phase , thermal free - free dominate for the radio emission .",
    "nobeyama radiopolarimeter ( norp ; @xcite ) , that observes the sun in the 1 , 2 , 3.75 , 9.4 , 17 , and 35 ghz channels , supports it with the same aspect at the high frequencies where the plasma becomes optically thin .    in figure 2 , we present spatial features of radio emission sources associated with the flare loops .",
    "figure 2a exhibits the aia 335   image taken at 00:30 ut and the brightness temperature ( @xmath7 ) contours of norh 17 and 34 ghz .",
    "figure 2b shows norh 17 ghz @xmath7 map with a contour of euv flare loops observed by aia 335   channel .",
    "the flare loops are coincided with the microwave source .",
    "the top of the flare loops emanate strong euv emission continuously through the whole flare procedure . in figure 3",
    ", we plotted the variation of the maximum counts recorded in the aia 335   channel for the flare region .",
    "since the top of the flare loops is the dominant source during the flare , this plot reflects the intensity variation of the flare loop - top .",
    "interestingly , it shows an obvious decaying oscillation pattern after the flare peak time .",
    "unfortunately , we could nt confirm it in aia 131 and 94 channel , where the peak of the temperature response is higher than 7 mk , due to the saturation effect on the top of the flare loops .",
    "the norh observation at two frequencies allows us to derive a spectral index @xmath8 for a spatially resolved region such as the loop top or loop footpoint . the index @xmath8 is given by the ratio of the fluxes obtained at 17 and 34 ghz , @xmath9 . for the top of the arcade ( the white box in figure 2b ) ,",
    "the derived index @xmath8 is close to 0 within range of -0.2 @xmath10 0.7 during the decay phase .",
    "it imply that the radio emission in this region comes from an optically thin plasma @xcite .",
    "we estimated the plasma temperature of the flare loops using the ratio of the goes two channels ( 18   and 0.54   ) .",
    "although goes satellite observes the full sun , it is reasonable to use it in our analysis because only this flaring loop is the predominant source for the increasing x - ray flux during the flare time .",
    "using goes widget , we derived the temperature in the flare loops @xcite .",
    "the temperature response function of each filter is derived using the coronal abundances in chianti 6.0.1 @xcite .",
    "the estimated peak temperature is 18 mk .",
    "then , the temperature gradually decreases to about 7 mk ( top panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "since we are focusing on the top of the flare loops that appears in microwave imaging data , we do not use goes emission measure estimated over the whole flare .",
    "to derive the electron number density of the flare loop - top region , we used the brightness temperature obtained at 17 ghz of norh and the estimated plasma temperature by the goes two channels .",
    "based on the observations , we assume that in the top of the flare loops the free - free emission from the optically thin thermal plasma ( the optical depth @xmath11 ) is dominant . according to the radiative transfer at the radio frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the relation between the brightness temperature @xmath7 and the plasma temperature @xmath12 is given as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is @xmath15 @xmath16 is the emission measure ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 is the coulomb logarithm ( @xmath19 $ ] ) .",
    "the path on the line - of - sight ( @xmath20 ) is assumed as the half of the distance between footpoints of the flare loops seen in the contour on figure 2b ( @xmath20 = 25 mm ) . substituting these observational results to equation ( 2 )",
    ", we derived @xmath16 and then estimated the number density of electrons at the top of the flare loops .",
    "the middle panel of figure 4 shows the resulted electron density variation with time during the whole flare process .",
    "since the peak emission of the flare is not caused by the thermal free - free but by the strong gyrosynchrotron emission , the density estimation related with the flare peak time can not be analyzed as a physical parameter in our assumptions .",
    "therefore we have examined the density estimated from 00:00 ut ( the vertical dashed line in figure 4 ) to 00:50 ut , from the time when the emission only come from the free - free transition to just before the next flare start . from 00:00 ut ,",
    "the density fluctuations come into sight and its amplitude gradually diminish with time .",
    "the time dependence of the electron density derived by the radio emission ( middle panel of figure 4 ) , as well as the euv emission ( figure 3 ) , shows a decaying long - period oscillatory pattern . to emphasise the oscillatory pattern we",
    "de - trend the observational curve by subtracting the same curve averaged by 500 s. best - fitting the de - trended observational curve from 00:00 ut by a decaying harmonic function gives us the parameters of this oscillation : the period of 710 s and the decay time of 1500 s. the amplitude of the oscillation is about 6% of the background in the beginning of the oscillations .",
    "the result of this approximation , shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 , demonstrates a rather good agreement between the observational and the best - fitted curve . also , we see that the amplitude of short - period fluctuations from this decaying harmonic curve decreases with time",
    ". we would like to stress that the detection of the oscillation is not sensitive to the specific choice of the time scale in the boxcar de - trending , as the oscillatory pattern is clearly visible in the original signal .",
    "we have demonstrated that there is an electron density qpp oscillation with 11.8-min period and 25-min decay time , and the amplitude of several percent of the background in the flare loops .",
    "this electron density have been deduced by radio emission observed by 17 ghz nobeyama radioheliograph and it is first evidence of radio observation for the long - period oscillation of the thermal emission produced by a flare .",
    "the qpp is also well - pronounced in the euv 335  signal obtained with sdo / aia .",
    "the observed parameters of the oscillation , the period and decay time , as well as its compressive nature , are similar to the compressive oscillations of coronal loops , known as sumer oscillations .    following the interpretation of sumer oscillations as a standing slow magnetoacoustic wave @xcite we estimate parameters of the observed oscillation .",
    "consider two lowest spatial harmonics . in the slow wave the density",
    "is perturbed because of the spatial redistribution of the matter mainly along the magnetic field . in a loop",
    "it corresponds to the field - aligned movement of the plasma from one footpoint to the other ( in the fundamental mode ) or from both the footpoint to the apex ( in the second standing harmonics ) . taking the loop height of about 50  and assuming that the loop is of semi - circular shape , we get its length of about 115 mm . the fundamental mode has the wavelengths of @xmath21  mm .",
    "the wavelength of the second spatial harmonics is @xmath22  mm . estimating the phase speeds as the ratio of the wavelengths to the value of the period , 710 s , we obtain about 320 km / s for the fundamental mode and 160 km / s for the second spatial harmonics .",
    "the plasma temperature associated with the 335  channel is about 2.5 mk , which gives us the sound speed of about @xmath23  km / s .",
    "this value is consistent with the phase speed required for the interpretation of the oscillations in terms of the fundamental acoustic mode ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , temperature diagnostics performed with the use of goes data shows that the plasma has higher temperature , about 7  mk ( see sec .  [ sec_dens ] ) . for this temperature ,",
    "the sound speed @xmath2 is greater than 380 km / s . in this case , the decrease in the phase speed can be attributed to the relatively low value of the alfvn speed @xmath3 , of the value of the sound speed .",
    "this reduces the phase speed of the longitudinal waves @xmath24 to the required value if @xmath25 .",
    "this result is consistent with the estimations of the plasma beta @xcite , which show that in flaring loops this parameter could reach or even exceed unity , giving us the tube speed of the required value .",
    "the fact that the oscillations are well seen in the 335  channel can be attributed to the effect of the crosstalk from the 131 channel @xcite .",
    "the oscillation is not seen in hotter channels of aia because of the saturation .    also ,",
    "if the oscillation of the emission detected in the 335  channel is produced by the cooler plasma , this oscillation can be induced by the slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the hotter loops .",
    "one possible scenario is based upon the possibility that hot and cool loops form loop bundles , with the steep temperature gradient in the transverse direction .",
    "slow magnetoacoustic oscillations cause not only longitudinal , but also transverse motions of the plasma .",
    "these transverse motions grow with the increase in beta , and are significant when beta is about unity . hence , standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations channeled by hotter loops would naturally affect the cooler plasma in the cooler loops situated nearby , and hence may be visible in the cooler temperature emission .",
    "thus , we conclude that our results give the first direct observational evidence of slow magnetoacoustic waves in the solar corona in the thermal radio emission , similar to the phenomenon known as sumer oscillations .",
    "the observed gradual decrease in the electron density fluctuations from the decaying harmonic pattern can be attributed to the decay of the compressible turbulence in the flaring site , excited by the flare , and should be subject to further investigation .                                                                             at norh 17 ghz ( orange ) and 34 ghz ( green ) .",
