    "in conclusion , we presented a generalization of the method of wigner function moments which allowed us to include pair correlations without violating the continuity equation .",
    "the method was exemplified by the calculation of isovector and isoscalar giant resonances and low - lying excitations in the harmonic oscillator model with quadrupole - quadrupole residual interaction .",
    "the analytical formulae , derived in a slightly simplified model ( approximation ( [ approx1 ] ) ) , reproduce very well the experimentally observed deformation dependence of the energy and @xmath0 factor of the scissors mode .",
