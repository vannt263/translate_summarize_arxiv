    "the advent of precise data on inclusive hadron production at @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 colliders offers the challenging opportunity to test quantitatively the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "the inclusive cross section is expressed as a convolution of the parton density functions ( pdf ) , the partonic cross sections , and the fragmentation functions ( ff ) of the quarks and gluons into the outgoing hadrons .",
    "the factorization theorem ensures that the pdf and ff are universal and that only the hard - scattering partonic cross sections change when different processes are considered .",
    "while there exist highly sophisticated sets of the pdf for the incoming protons and photons , which are needed for the analysis of inclusive particle production in @xmath5 and @xmath4 reactions , the status of the quark and gluon ff is much less advanced . the most direct way to obtain information on",
    "the ff is to analyse the energy spectrum of the hadrons into which the jets produced by @xmath0 annihilation fragment .",
    "recently , we performed such an analysis to extract ff for charged pions and kaons at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd @xcite .",
    "these ff were generated through fits to @xmath0-annihilation data taken at centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath6 gev by the tpc collaboration at slac @xcite .",
    "about one year ago , these were the most precise data for charged - pion and -kaon production .",
    "our ff also led to rather satisfactory descriptions of other @xmath0 data on charged - particle production at lower ( doris @xcite ) , similar ( pep @xcite ) , and higher energies ( petra @xcite , tristan @xcite , and lep @xcite ) .",
    "these new parameterizations  in particular , the nlo sets  were tested against data on single - charged - hadron production obtained by the h1 collaboration in @xmath4-scattering experiments at hera @xcite in refs .",
    "@xcite and against similar data obtained in various @xmath5 experiments in ref .",
    "the agreement between experimental data and theory turned out to be very satisfactory .",
    "this motivates us to further improve the ff , especially since detailed high - statistics data on charged - hadron production at lep have become available @xcite . for our extended analysis",
    ", we shall employ very accurate data from the aleph collaboration at lep , who partly discriminated between pions and kaons @xcite . in the data sample without discrimination of the hadron species , they distinguished between three cases , namely fragmentation of ( i ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 quarks , ( ii ) @xmath10 quarks only , and ( iii ) all five quark flavours ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 ) .",
    "in particular , the latter data on the fragmentation of specific quark flavours enables us to remove a theoretical assumption which we had to make in our earlier work @xcite , namely that the @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 ( @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 ) quarks fragment into charged pions ( kaons ) in the same way .",
    "as is well known , @xmath10 quarks are produced considerably more copiously at the @xmath12 resonance than at lower cm energies .",
    "therefore , aleph was able to separate the fragmentation of @xmath10 quarks into charged hadrons from the fragmentation of all other quarks . on the basis of these new aleph data on charged - hadron production ,",
    "cowan @xcite has performed a similar analysis using the altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations @xcite for the @xmath13 evolution and incorporating data from other experiments at lower energy .",
    "the scope of his analysis is quite different from ours .",
    "he concentrates on charged - hadron data and is chiefly interested in establishing the scaling violation so as to determine @xmath14 .",
    "another significant difference is that he uses a rather high starting scale , @xmath15  gev , which lies well above the scale characteristic for our @xmath4 studies .",
    "similarly to the case of the pdf , the method of choice for our purposes it to use simple parameterizations at the low threshold scales .",
    "a problem that requires special attention is related to the gluon fragmentation into charged hadrons .",
    "although the gluon does not couple directly to the electroweak currents , it contributes in higher orders and mixes with the quarks through the @xmath13 evolution .",
    "this renders it very difficult to pin down the gluon ff by using just the energy spectrum of hadrons produced by @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "however , the gluon fragmentation can be probed in @xmath0 annihilation by exploiting tagged three - jet events or longitudinal polarization .",
    "as in our earlier work @xcite , we use the information on tagged three - jet events made available by the opal collaboration @xcite to test our gluon ff .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that a sufficiently sizeable gluon ff into charged hadrons is essential to reach good agreement with the data of single - charged hadron production in @xmath5 processes .",
    "since gluon production is also significant in @xmath4 collisions at hera , we should be able to further test the strength of the gluon ff extracted from @xmath0 data by making comparisons with data on inclusive photoproduction of charged hadrons recently collected by the h1 @xcite and zeus collaborations @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to make use of the recent data by aleph @xcite in addition to the data by tpc @xcite and opal @xcite to construct new sets of lo and nlo ff without imposing identities between the ff of different flavours .",
    "( we shall still identify the ff of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks into charged pions and those of @xmath7 and @xmath9 quarks into charged kaons . )",
    "the new ff sets will be tested against additional @xmath0 data from lep and @xmath0 colliders with lower cm energies .",
    "in addition , we shall study single - charged hadron production in @xmath4 collisions under hera conditions in order to check the consistency of our ff with the new h1 @xcite and zeus data @xcite , in particular with respect to the issue of the gluon ff",
    ".    this work is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shall introduce the formalism needed to extract the ff from @xmath0 data on inclusive single - hadron production at nlo . in section  3",
    ", we shall present the formulae that describe inclusive single - hadron production in @xmath4 collisions with almost real photons .",
    "section  4 will deal with the actual analysis and the discussion of our results . in section  5",
    ", we shall check our results against @xmath0 data which we did not use in our fits and against the recent h1 and zeus data .",

    "the inclusive production of a hadron @xmath16 by @xmath0 annihilation , @xmath17 is completely characterized by three observables .",
    "these are the energy fraction of the outgoing hadron @xmath18 , its angle with the beam axis @xmath19 and the total energy of the system @xmath20 . the cross section of process  ( [ process ] ) exhibits the angular structure @xmath21 where the superscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the contributions due to transverse and longitudinal polarizations , respectively , and the asymmetric term , labelled @xmath24 , accounts for the interference of the photon with the @xmath12 boson .",
    "usually , experiments do not determine @xmath19 distributions .",

    "<S> we present new sets of fragmentation functions for charged pions and kaons , both at leading and next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> they are fitted to data on inclusive charged - hadron production in @xmath0 annihilation taken by tpc at pep ( @xmath1  gev ) and to similar data by aleph at lep , who discriminated between events with charm , bottom , and light - flavour fragmentation in their charged - hadron sample . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to our previous analysis , where we only distinguished between valence - quark , sea - quark , and gluon fragmentation , we are now able to treat all partons independently and to properly incorporate the charm and bottom thresholds . due to the sizeable energy gap between pep and lep , we are sensitive to the scaling violation in the fragmentation process , which allows us to extract a value for the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> recent data on inclusive charged - hadron production in tagged three - jet events by opal and similar data for longitudinal electron polarization by aleph allow us to pin down the gluon fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> our new fragmentation functions lead to an excellent description of a multitude of other @xmath0 data on inclusive charged - hadron production , ranging from @xmath3  gev to lep energy . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , they agree nicely with the transverse - momentum spectra of single charged hadrons measured by h1 and zeus in photoproduction at the @xmath4 collider hera , which represents a nontrivial check of the factorization theorem of the qcd - improved parton model . in this comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we also find first evidence for the interplay between the direct- and resolved - photon mechanisms and for the existence of a gluon density inside the photon .    </S>",
