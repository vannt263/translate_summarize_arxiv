    "a long standing open problem in the mathematical analysis of the stochastic ising model @xcite can be described as follows .",
    "consider the standard @xmath12 spin ising model at inverse temperature @xmath13 and zero external magnetic field in a cubic box @xmath14 , @xmath15 , of side @xmath2 , with homogeneous , e.g.  `` plus '' , boundary conditions outside @xmath16 ( see section [ sec : model ] for the precise definition ) .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the corresponding gibbs measure and assume that @xmath13 is larger ( or much larger ) than the critical value @xmath18 where the `` plus '' and the `` minus '' phases start to coexist . on the spin configuration space @xmath19",
    "consider also the continuous time markov chain , reversible w.r.t .",
    "the gibbs measure @xmath17 , in which each spin @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with rate one chooses a new value from @xmath12 with probabilities given by the conditional gibbs measure given the current values of the spins outside the site @xmath22 .",
    "such a chain is known in the literature as _ gibbs sampler _ or _ glauber chain _ and , because of reversibility , its unique stationary distribution coincides with @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the distribution of the chain at time @xmath24 when the initial configuration at time @xmath25 is @xmath26 and let @xmath27 be the minimum time such that the variation distance between @xmath23 and @xmath17 is smaller than , e.g. , @xmath28 for any @xmath29 . because @xmath16 is a finite set and the chain is ergodic , the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees that @xmath27 is finite and it is not too difficult to prove that @xmath30 for some constant @xmath31 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "despite the fact that the above upper bound is known to be the correct order of growth of @xmath27 when the boundary conditions are absent , i.e.  free ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , it is known that the presence of the homogeneous `` plus '' boundary conditions drastically modifies the whole process of relaxation to equilibrium . in this case the conjectured correct growth of @xmath27 as a function of @xmath2 is given by the lifshitz s law @xmath32 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , _ any _ polynomial upper bound on @xmath33 has escaped so far a rigorous analysis and the best known result , following a recent breakthrough @xcite , is confined to the two dimensional case @xmath9 and it is of the form @xmath34 for any @xmath35 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the conjectured @xmath10 growth of @xmath27 is related to the shrinking of a `` spherical '' bubble of the `` minus '' phase under the influence of the `` plus '' boundary conditions . on a macroscopic scale one expects @xcite that the dynamics of the bubble follows a _ motion by mean curvature _ which , if true , implies immediately that in a time @xmath36 the bubble disappears and equilibrium is achieved .",
    "some of the above questions and in particular the validity of the lifshitz s law can be formulated ( and its mathematical justification remains highly non - trivial ) even at zero temperature ( @xmath37 ) , a situation that was considered in great detail in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly one can consider , as we do in the sequel , an almost zero temperature , i.e.  @xmath38 and increasing so fast with @xmath2 that thermal fluctuations become irrelevant on the relaxation process . in the extreme case @xmath37",
    ", the stationary distribution is concentrated on the `` plus '' configuration ( i.e.  all spins equal to @xmath39 ) and the glauber chain evolves towards it without ever increasing the spin energy .",
    "the mixing time @xmath27 becomes closely related to the hitting time of the `` plus '' configuration starting from all minuses and it is not too hard to prove , by induction on the dimension @xmath40 ( starting from the case @xmath9 , which requires non - trivial work @xcite ) , an upper bound of the form @xmath41 .",
    "however the inductive argument , which in @xmath1 simply boils down to comparing the true evolution of the original cubic bubble of minuses with an auxiliary chain in which the @xmath2 two - dimensional square layers of the bubble disappear one after the other starting e.g.  from the top one , completely neglects the interesting cooperative effect in which the whole bubble , starting from the corners , is eroded by a `` mean curvature effect '' which enhances considerably its shrinking . in other words , the lifshitz s law in @xmath1 can not be proved or even approached closely without considering in detail how a two - dimensional curved interface separating the pluses from the minuses evolves in time .",
    "the first main contribution of the present work is a strategy to attack and solve the above problem at zero temperature for @xmath1 ( with logarithmic corrections ) and for @xmath9 ( with different constants in the upper and lower bounds ) .",
    "we refer to section [ sec : results ] for the precise statements . in the challenging three dimensional case",
    "our method involves the use and adaptation to our specific situation of two different and beautiful sets of results concerning :    a.   the gaussian free field - like equilibrium fluctuations of _ random monotone surfaces _ and their connection with _ random dimer coverings _ of the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice ( see @xcite ) ; b.   the mixing time of a glauber chain for monotone surfaces @xcite .    the key point of our approach is to prove that the evolution of the glauber chain is dominated by that of another effective chain which follows a motion by mean curvature , only slowed down by a logarithmic factor ( in the radius of the bubble ) . in turn",
    "the evolution of the bounding chain is constructed by `` peeling off '' at time @xmath24 a layer of logarithmic width from the bubble of radius @xmath42 .",
    "the peeling process is realized by letting relax to equilibrium a mesoscopic spherical cap of radius @xmath43 and height @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 stands for a suitable polynomial of @xmath46 ) centered at each point of the surface of the bubble .",
    "results ( i ) above are essential in order to prove the peeling effect while the results ( ii ) prove that the overall effect occurs on the correct time scale @xmath47 .",
    "we strongly believe that our approach can be helpful in solving other related problems .    the second contribution , this time for the model in dimension @xmath9 , are upper and lower bounds , _ linear _ in @xmath48 and _ uniform _ in @xmath49 , @xmath31 large enough , on the _ spectral gap _",
    "( see ) of the glauber chain . in @xcite for @xmath9",
    "the upper bound was proved ( apart from logarithmic corrections and with constants depending on @xmath13 ) for any @xmath35 and it was conjectured to be the correct behavior of the spectral gap ( to be compared with the @xmath10 scaling of the mixing time ) . in our case the proof of the lower bound ( the most interesting one ) has an analytic flavor .",
    "we first unitarily transform the original markov generator of the glauber chain acting on @xmath50 into a new matrix acting on @xmath51 with the flat ( i.e.  counting ) measure , whose off - diagonal elements corresponding to spin transitions which _ do not conserve the energy _ vanish very fast as @xmath52 .",
    "such a property , for @xmath53 , allows us to write the new matrix into a block - form plus a remainder whose norm is very small with @xmath2 . since each block describes a suitably killed glauber chain ( killing occurs as soon as the spin energy decreases ) the desired bound follows by a probabilistic analysis of the killing time for each block .",
    "given @xmath54 , we write @xmath55 if @xmath22 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath56 . to each point",
    "@xmath57 is assigned a spin @xmath20 which takes values in @xmath58 .",
    "given @xmath14 , we let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the set of all possible configurations in @xmath16 . the gibbs measure in a finite domain @xmath16 for a boundary condition @xmath61 at inverse temperature @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 when no danger of confusion arises , we will write just @xmath66 for @xmath67 . we will consider also the case @xmath37 , in which case @xmath67 is taken to be the uniform measure over all configurations @xmath68 which minimize @xmath69 .",

    "is associated an independent poisson clock of rate @xmath73 .",
    "when the clock labeled @xmath22 rings , say at time @xmath74 , one replaces @xmath20 with a value sampled from the probability distribution @xmath75 , where @xmath76 we denote the law of @xmath77 for a given time @xmath24 as @xmath78 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath70 is a markov process , reversible with respect to the equilibrium measure @xmath66 .",
    "we are interested in the order of magnitude of the `` mixing time '' , defined for some @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the total variation distance between two probability measures . when @xmath82 , we will just write @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "another quantity we will focus on is the spectral gap , @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the variance w.r.t .",
    "@xmath67 , @xmath87 is the generator of the dynamics , @xmath88 ( a more explicit expression for the generator is given in section [ sec : lbgap3d ] ) and the infimum is taken over non - constant functions @xmath89 .",
    "the inverse of the gap ( respectively the mixing time ) measures the speed of convergence to equilibrium in @xmath90 ( resp . in total variation norm ) .",
    "also , it is well known that @xmath91 which actually holds for any reversible markov process .        for notational clarity , in this subsection",
    "we indicate explicitly the dependence on the boundary condition @xmath92 in @xmath93 , the law of the dynamics @xmath94 at time @xmath24 , @xmath95 being the initial condition .",
    "the glauber dynamics enjoys the following well known monotonicity property .",
    "one can introduce a partial order in @xmath19 by saying that @xmath96 if @xmath97 for every @xmath72 .",
    "then , one has @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes stochastic domination ( one writes @xmath100 if @xmath101 for every increasing function @xmath102 , i.e.  @xmath103 whenever @xmath104",
    "; an event will be called increasing if its characteristic function is increasing ) . in particular , letting @xmath105 one obtains @xmath106 also , it is possible to realize on the same probability space the trajectories of the markov chain corresponding to distinct initial conditions @xmath95 and/or distinct boundary conditions @xmath92 , in such a way that , with probability one , @xmath107 this will be referred to as the `` monotone global coupling '' : its law will be denoted by @xmath108 and the corresponding expectation by @xmath109 .    throughout the paper we will apply several times the above monotonicity properties : for brevity , we will simply say `` by monotonicity ...
