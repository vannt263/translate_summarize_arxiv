    "methanol , oh and water masers are generally seen toward star - forming regions and exhibit narrow , strong emission line features coming from bright small spots .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath0 of the spots is very high , from @xmath1k for methanol masers , to @xmath2k for oh masers , and @xmath3k for water masers . in many cases",
    "the above values are only lower limits since maser spots are barely resolved with vlbi .",
    "variability time scale often indicates , in an indirect way , a smaller linear size and still higher brightness temperature .",
    "there must be physical limits on the brightness temperature as there are for thermal and synchrotron emission in continuum sources .",
    "the brightness temperature of the thermal free - free emission from ionized gas depends on the kinetic temperature @xmath4 of electrons and optical depth .",
    "it is the highest for optically thick sources and is equal to the kinetic temperature . in hii regions",
    "the kinetic temperature of electrons is limited to @xmath4=10,000k by the energy losses from electrons through the line emission of heavy elements .",
    "similarly , in synchrotron sources the brightness temperature is at maximum in optically thick sources , and is equal to the kinetic temperature of relativistic electrons .",
    "the kinetic energy of relativistic electrons is limited to @xmath5@xmath6k by the energy loss through inverse compton emission on synchrotron photons ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "the same arguments can be applied to molecular line emission : in the optically thick sources the brightness temperature in the line is limited by the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "the molecular maser sources make an exception because the absorption coefficient and optical depth are both negative due to the population inversion : the brightness temperature of the maser line emission may increase indefinitely with the optical depth .",
    "however other mechanisms can limit the brightness temperature of the maser lines , such as the radiation line broadening , or the resonance stark - effect caused by the maser radiation field ( we call it self - stark limit by analogy with self - compton limit ) .",
    "the natural band width of a molecular emission line in the absence of external field is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is spontaneous emission rate at the frequency of the line @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the dipole - moment matrix element for the transition , and @xmath11 is planck constant .",
    "this is a very small band width compared to the observed line widths . for oh line at 1665mhz , @xmath12s@xmath13 , and for water line at 22.235ghz , @xmath14s@xmath13 , and",
    "the natural band widths are @xmath15hz and @xmath16hz , respectively . in strong masers like or every oh or h@xmath17o molecule",
    "is exposed to the intense radiation field , produced by all other molecules in the maser emission region .",
    "that causes frequent up and down transitions between the energy levels involved , due to induced emission and absorption .",
    "the time which a molecules spends on the energy level is greatly reduced , by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "the linewidth is increased by the same factor which can be very large when the brightness temperature is high . for oh maser with brightness temperature",
    "@xmath2k the linewidth is 1,700hz ( 0.3kms@xmath13 ) , and for water maser with the brightness temperature @xmath3k it is 0.6mhz ( 8kms@xmath13 ) .",
    "this linewidth is comparable to or even greater than observed line widths in masers .",
    "einstein induced emission and absorption coefficients can be used only in the weak field case . for the strong field which is the case in water masers",
    "a correct description of the interaction between a molecule and the narrow band radiation field is the resonance stark effect approach . in the weak field",
    "the resonance stark effect is quadratic with respect to the electric field strength @xmath19 , and causes the line broadening . in the strong field",
    "the resonance stark effect becomes linear , and causes line splitting into a main line at the transition frequency @xmath9 and two satellite lines at frequencies @xmath9@xmath20@xmath10@xmath21 for non - degenerate energy levels such as are levels of the oh line transition at 1665mhz .",
    "the energy levels of the h@xmath17o transition at 22.235ghz are degenerate , and are split in several satellite components ( slysh 1973 ) . ac electric field strength @xmath19 is related to the brightness temperature @xmath0 of the maser radiation of band width @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "this relation holds for the isotropic distribution of the radiation intensity .",
    "if the radiation is concentrated in the solid angle @xmath24 , the electric field strength must be multiplied by @xmath25 , with the corresponding reduction of the line splitting . for the line broadening the reduction factor",
    "is @xmath26 .",
    "o maser spectral feature in w3oh obtained from vlba archive data , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    1.1mas , scaledwidth=85.0% ]",
    "the strongest spectral feature in h@xmath17o maser is completely unresolved on all vlba baselines ( fig .  1 ) , and its brightness temperature exceeds @xmath27k .",
    "another strong h@xmath17o maser , an outburst in , was measured with the space radio telescope _",
    "halca _ to have brightness temperature @xmath0=@xmath28k ( kobayashi et al 2000 ) .",
    "oh maser was unresolved on baselines from ground to space radio telescope _",
    "halca _ , and the brightness temperature exceeds @xmath29k ( fig .  2 )",
    "no line splitting due to the resonance stark effect was observed in h@xmath17o or oh masers .",
    "also , no significant radiation line broadening is seen in the line profiles .",
    "this means that the electric field strength in the masers is weak enough in spite of the very high brightness temperature , because of the small solid angle in which emission is directed . assuming that the the radiation broadening contributes to the total linewidth less than 1/5 of the linewidth , one can put an upper limit on the solid angle .",
    "one has for oh maser an upper limit for the emission solid angle @xmath26=0.02 . for h@xmath17o masers in one",
    "has @xmath26=0.005 , and for the outburst h@xmath17o maser in @xmath26=0.002 as the upper limits .",
    "the brightness temperature of cosmic masers is limited by the radiation broadening in the intense radiation field at the frequency of the maser emission . up to now",
    "no radiation broadening has been observed in oh and h@xmath17o masers , which can be due to the very small solid angle in which the emission is directed .",
    "the theory of the resonance radiation broadening allows us to put stringent upper limits on the emission solid angle .",
    "this may be important for the further development of cosmic maser models .",
