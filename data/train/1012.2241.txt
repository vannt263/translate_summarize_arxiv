    "for several smooth nonlinear maps and differential equations , stable periodic orbits and their dependence on the system control parameters are well known .",
    "the existence of these orbits can be properly visualized on a bi - dimensional parameter space , where generally we find _ periodic windows _ ,",
    "i.e. , continuous sets of parameters , embedded into chaotic regions , for which periodical orbits exist @xcite .",
    "there is an intricate periodic window , quite general in dynamical systems , whose local nature was explained in @xcite but the global features , despite the great number of studies @xcite , remain not well understood . for local and global features",
    "we mean typically qualities of an isolated and a multiple periodic windows , respectively .",
    "recently , it has been found that these periodic windows , baptized shrimp @xcite , are continuously connected along spirals emerging from in a homoclinic bifurcation point @xcite ( set of parameters for which a bi - asymptotic curve , the homoclinic orbit , converges to a saddle - focus equilibrium point ) .",
    "these spiral structures were verified experimentally in @xcite and are also observed in @xcite .",
    "however , in these researches the distribution of shrimps in the parameter space have not yet been clearly associated to any fundamental dynamical property . to accomplish this",
    ", we investigate the relation between the shrimps and the homoclinic curves in the parameter space @xcite . for the rssler system",
    ", we present a new and remarkable two - parameter space scenery where from each shrimp emerge infinity spirals with focus in discrete points along of a homoclinic bifurcation curve ( continuous parameter sets for which homoclinic orbits exist ) . each spiral is composed by a shrimp family , _",
    "i.e. _ , infinite shrimps continuously connected in a spiral sequence .",
    "we show that , even the shrimps are a codimension - two phenomena ( two parameters are necessary to obtain it ) , they are accumulating at the spiral focus following scaling laws predicted by the one - parameter space homoclinic theory @xcite .",
    "we also show that the reported period adding cascades observed in shrimps accumulations @xcite is a consequence of the spiral periodic windows approach to the homoclinic bifurcation point .",
    "recently was published a work @xcite about scaling laws in a electronic homoclinic system where the authors associate scales of tangent bifurcation with the shrimp distribution . here",
    "we discuss this issue in details and show that , in the two - parameter space , the scales measured in shrimps correspond to the distance between crosses of superstable periodic curves .",
    "furthermore , we call the attention to the necessity of a rigorous prove of these scales in shrimp distributions which was done in @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec1 ] we present the spiral scenery of periodic windows , in [ sec2 ] we show the scaling laws concerning its distribution and periodicity , and in section [ sec3 ] we present the conclusions .",
    "we consider the homoclinic rssler system given by @xmath0 where we fix @xmath1 and analyze the parameter space @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . for the region investigated ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) the origin phase space ( @xmath8 ) is a saddle - focus and the eigenvalues of eqs .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) jacobian matrix evaluated at @xmath8 are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are @xmath14 .",
    "periodic and chaotic asymptotic solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) are determined numerically by evaluating the largest nonzero lyapunov exponent @xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , from black to white ( @xmath16 ) the periodic orbits increase their stability : in black these orbits bifurcate ( @xmath17 ) and in white they are superstable ( @xmath15 achieve the most negative value ) . otherwise , from black to yellow ( @xmath18 ) the behavior is asymptotically chaotic .",
    "the structure labeled @xmath19 is a particular region of the parameter space where a typical periodic window , the shrimp , can be visualized .",
    "the big shadow region , from which extends four narrow antennae , is its _ central body _ and corresponds to the fundamental periodic window where is the _ fundamental periodic orbit _ of the shrimp @xcite .",
    "the central body is bordered by tangent bifurcations , where we find chaotic regions , and by flip bifurcations , where we find sequences of doubled periodic regions with similar shape to the central body .",
    "the white lines form the shrimp _ skeleton _ ( parameters set where the periodic regions are around ) and represent superstable periodic orbits with behavior strongly attractive .",
    "note that , in the central body , there is a cross between two remarkable superstable curves ( blue dots in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "we consider this point as a shrimp position and localize it identifying these intersections . in this sense",
    ", shrimps are codimensio - two structures .        to obtain the parameter sets of the homoclinic bifurcation @xmath20 associated with the saddle - focus point @xmath8 , we determine numerically the parameters for which the stable and unstable manifolds of @xmath8 merge constituting a homoclinic orbit ( to obtain homoclinic orbits in piecewise systems , see ref .",
    "the labels @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , indicate different shrimp families associated with @xmath20 .",
    "note that , in each family , shrimps are continuously connected along a spiral sequence around a homoclinic bifurcation point [ typically , two antennae of each shrimp central body is connected with the previous and the next shrimp and the other two antennae connect the shrimp to the divergence region ( @xmath26 ) ] . the index @xmath27 , in the label families , indicates the element of these sequence .",
    "the first shrimp of the sequence is indexed by @xmath28 , the second by @xmath29 , and so on .",
    "the index @xmath30 indicates the structure that connect different families .",
    "thus , @xmath31 connect family @xmath21 with family @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , excluding the central body of @xmath32 , for example , @xmath31 has the same features that characterize family @xmath22 .",
    "we observe that each shrimp generates many others spiral sequences by flip bifurcations .",
    "the central bodies of @xmath32 and @xmath19 , in fig .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) , bifurcate in @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , which connect the family @xmath21 with the families @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the family @xmath22 converges to the region close the point ( @xmath36 = 0.0228 , @xmath37 = 0.0550 ) in an anti - clockwise direction and the family @xmath23 converges to the region close the point ( @xmath36 = 0.0333 , @xmath37 = 0.0800 ) in a clockwise direction .",
    "both focus seems to be along the @xmath20 homoclinic bifurcation curve [ see magnifications in figs . [",
    "fig-1](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "the families @xmath21 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 converge to the @xmath20 onset point ( 0,0 ) [ see figs .",
    "[ fig-1](a ) and ( d ) ] . the schematic scenery is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] . as far we could check , the same is observed in any element of any family suggesting the existence of a fractal structure of spiral self - replications converging asymptotically to the homoclinic bifurcation curve .",
    "moreover , we identify shrimps concentrated in two sets , between the two shrimp antennae that converge to the divergence region ( as @xmath22 and @xmath23 families ) , and between two shrimps , @xmath27 and @xmath38 , of the same family ( as @xmath24 and @xmath25 families ) .    with respect the trajectory behavior ,",
    "following continuously a shrimp spiral sequence , we observe that the orbit time - period grows smoothly tending to infinity close the homoclinic orbit . so that , the fundamental periodic orbit add one cycle from @xmath27-shrimp to the @xmath39-shrimp forming a period adding cascade accumulating into the @xmath20 curve , as shown in figs . [ fig-3 ] ( a)-(d ) .",
    "the period adding can be identified considering a flat poincar section in @xmath40 with @xmath41 close to the plan @xmath42 ( represented by the dashed lines ) .",
    "the orbits cross the poincar section two times in ( a ) , three times in ( b ) , and four times in ( c ) .",
    "the homoclinic orbit @xmath20 has infinite cycles in ( d ) .",
    "note that here we considered @xmath43 as a shrimp as discussed before .",
    "next we analyse our numerical results presented in the last section from the homoclinic theory described by shilnikov theorem .",
    "we focus in the characterization of the two - parameter shrimp structures from these one - parameter theory .",
    "shilnikov theorem can be applied to systems which saddle - focus equilibrium point have homoclinic orbits ( @xmath44 ) solutions and , in its normal form , can be represented by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are analytic functions with @xmath49 , for the equilibrium saddle - focus point @xmath50 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are @xmath51 .",
    "if the saddle - focus form @xmath44 with saddle index @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , the shilnikov theorem shows that , close to @xmath44 , in a one - parameter space , there are infinite countable sets of periodic and homoclinic bifurcations accumulating into @xmath44 , namely : ( i ) stable periodic solutions emerge distributed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two consecutive tangent bifurcation parameters @xcite .",
    "the period difference between two consecutive periodic orbits is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the period of the @xmath27-periodic orbit ; ( ii ) infinite classes of homoclinic orbit , characterized by similar orbits , called secondary homoclinic orbits [ double - pulse ( @xmath59 ) , triple - pulse ( @xmath60 ) , and @xmath61-pulse ( @xmath62 ) ] are distributed following @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are two consecutive homoclinic bifurcation parameters of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath66 is related with the primary single - pulse ( @xmath67 ) .     and",
    "@xmath68 , in the limit @xmath69 , of the family @xmath21 .",
    "the symbols square , triangle , and circle are respect families @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23.,width=264 ]    to associate the shrimps with this theory , we verify these scaling laws in our numerical simulation . for the family @xmath21 ,",
    "the homoclinic orbit parameter is @xmath70 for which the eigenvalues calculated at the fixed point @xmath8 are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the scaling laws are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . to measure numerically the periodic orbit scaling @xmath76 , we define @xmath77 , with @xmath78^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath79 is an intersection point between two superstable curves as defined before the @xmath27-shrimp position .",
    "the measured @xmath80 for the shrimp family @xmath21 converges quickly to the theoretical scaling parameter @xmath76 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-4](a ) ( curve with square symbol ) .",
    "figure [ fig-4](b ) shows that the measured time - period differences @xmath81 also converge quickly to the theoretical scaling @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath83 , the period difference between @xmath84 and @xmath85 is @xmath86 .",
    "this interval time corresponds to one periodic orbit revolution close to the unstable manifold ( plan @xmath42 ) and explains the period adding phenomenon in homoclinic systems .",
    "it suggests that similar mechanism can explain the period adding in other systems . for the family @xmath22",
    ", we consider @xmath87 .",
    "the eigenvalues calculated at @xmath8 are @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , the scaling laws are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , similarly to the family @xmath21 . and , for the family @xmath23 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the scalings @xmath80 and @xmath99 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 families are in agreement to the theoretical estimated @xmath76 and @xmath100 as shown in fig . [ fig-4](a ) and ( b ) ( triangle and circle symbols for @xmath22 and @xmath23 families , respectively ) .",
    "although the homoclinic scaling law parameters is very low for being verified numerically , we have observed the existence of many different bifurcations @xmath101 close to the primary @xmath20 homoclinic curve parameter .",
    "the scalings measured of families @xmath24 and @xmath25 have values very similar to the family @xmath21 and it was omitted in fig . [ fig-4 ] .",
    "we emphasize that it is not expected that the scaling laws here considered match with the shrimps scalings , since shrimps are a codimension - two phenomena .",
    "our results suggest strongly that shrimps are distributed along lines in regions close to the homoclinic orbit bifurcation [ see figs .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( b)-(d ) ] .",
    "we used the knowledge of homoclinic orbits distribution in the bi - dimensional parameter space to explain the distribution of periodic windows in this space .",
    "we found infinite periodic structures with spiral shape distributed along the homoclinic bifurcation curve @xmath20 .",
    "each spiral has two extremities : one is a point in @xmath20 , which is its focus , and the other is a shrimp . in the other side , from each shrimp derive infinite spirals with different focus along @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the spiral are composed by infinite shrimps , which compose infinite spirals which have infinite shrimps which compose infinite spirals and son on .",
    "this characterize the fractality of this scenery of spirals .",
    "it is worth to mention that , excluding family @xmath21 , each spiral is composed by a family of shrimps that , close the @xmath20 curve , the shape of its orbit in the phase space approaches the shape of an secondary homoclinic orbit @xmath62 ( also called subsidiary homoclinic orbit ) .",
    "it suggest that the real focus of each spiral is a point close @xmath20 where is formed a @xmath62 orbit . as discussed before , the classes of homoclinic orbit are organized close @xmath20 following the scale @xmath102 .",
    "thus we argue that the spiral distribution in the parameter space should follows the scale @xmath102 .",
    "we have also identified properties of the homoclinic theory in the shrimps organization .",
    "we notice that this result is not expected since the homoclinic scalings are valid just in a one - parameter space and shrimps are two - parameter structures .",
    "it indicates that shrimps , close to the homoclinic bifurcation , are organized along a line that intersects @xmath20 .",
    "the analytical prove of this is merit of investigation @xcite .",
