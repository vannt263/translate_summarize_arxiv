    "frustrated quantum magnets represent one of the richest playgrounds to investigate quantum collective phenomena @xcite .",
    "indeed known models of frustrated quantum magnets might admit quantum ground states without any classical counterpart , such as valence bond crystals , or resonating - valence - bond spin liquids @xcite .",
    "most of the investigations have focused on heisenberg antiferromagnets , due to their relevance to real compounds , although the lack of well controlled analytical or numerical approaches for the bulk properties of these systems still leaves the question open on the true nature of their ground state @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum - disordered ground states have been shown to emerge in models with strongly anisotropic interactions ( in spin space and/or in real space ) which appear to provide the first controlled realizations of quantum spin liquids with a topological nature @xcite .",
    "some of these systems are related to quantum dimer models @xcite , which have provided the first known examples of quantum spin - liquid ground states @xcite .    in this class of anisotropic systems",
    "a special role is played by frustrated quantum ising models , namely ising systems enriched with quantum fluctuations , coming either from an exchange coupling in the transverse spin components , or from a transverse magnetic field @xcite . in the absence of quantum fluctuations , ising models on frustrated lattices have generally a _ classical _ spin liquid nature , namely they exhibit an exponential degeneracy of the ground state  as it is the case for the ising antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice , kagom lattice , checkerboard lattice , pyrochlore lattice , etc . , with however correlations that can be long - ranged , algebraic or short - ranged .",
    "the effect of quantum fluctuations is in general that of lifting the large degeneracy of ground states , leading either to the emergence of an ordered ground state ( as _ e.g. _ in the case of the triangular lattice @xcite ) or to a ground state with novel spin - liquid properties ( as it appears to be the case for the pyrochlore lattice @xcite ) . in this study",
    "we focus on the ising antiferromagnet on the checkerboard lattice , which represents a fundamental model of frustrated magnetism in two dimensions .",
    "indeed , in the case of spatially isotropic interactions the ground state properties of the system are equivalent to those of the unbiased six - vertex model , also known as square ice @xcite . the effect of quantum fluctuations on such a system has been the subject of several recent investigations @xcite , focusing particularly on the limit of weak quantum fluctuations , treated within degenerate perturbation theory .    in the present study",
    "we adopt a different strategy , which allows us to treat arbitrarily strong quantum fluctuations in a generalized version of square ice .",
    "we investigate the @xmath0 ising model on the checkerboard lattice with different couplings along the coordinate axes ( @xmath1 ) and along the diagonals ( @xmath2 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the anisotropy in the couplings allows to introduces a bias in the vertex weights of the corresponding vertex model , reducing the degeneracy to exponential in the linear dimensions of the system ( @xmath5 ) , or even to a finite value ( for @xmath6 ) .",
    "the application of a transverse field allows therefore to investigate the effect of quantum fluctuations on a classical manifold of states with variable degeneracy .",
    "quantum fluctuations are investigated via linear spin - wave theory , accounting for the harmonic fluctuations around the classical ground state .",
    "albeit limited to the harmonic approximation , such an approach allows for investigation of arbitrarily strong fields , and its breakdown signals the candidate regions in the phase diagram where novel quantum disordered behavior can be expected . on the side",
    "@xmath5 the infinite degeneracy of the ground state would a priori make the spin - wave analysis impossible , given the exceedingly large number of possible classical reference states .",
    "in fact we demonstrate that the spin - wave spectrum does _ not _ depend on the particular classical ground state chosen as a reference .",
    "this implies that the spectrum of linear excitations is defined unambiguously in the @xmath5 region - this situation persists also in the isotropic case of square ice , @xmath7 , for which the lowest branch of the excitation spectrum is a flat band .",
    "but this implies as well that the classical degeneracy remains unaltered in presence of harmonic quantum fluctuations , which means that only non - linear quantum fluctuations can lift the degeneracy , a situation previously encountered in a number of frustrated magnets@xcite .",
    "moreover , harmonic quantum fluctuations triggered by a sufficiently strong field are found to reverse the classical hierarchy of ordered states close to the isotropic ( @xmath3 ) limit , suggesting that anharmonic fluctuations might destabilize the classical order completely .",
    "finally the classical order parameter is found to be completely washed out by quantum fluctuations for strong fields close to the classical polarization transition , and for couplings close to the isotropic case .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the transverse field ising model ( tfim ) on the checkerboard lattice can harbor quantum disordered phases for strong frustration and fields , and that non - linear quantum fluctuations are expected to play a major role in the case of extensive degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : sec .",

    "the general framework of spin - wave theory for the tfim on arbitrary lattices is presented in appendix  [ diag ] , while the spin - wave observables for the checkerboard lattice are discussed in appendix  [ diagnc ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the tfim on the checkerboard lattice reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 are quantum spins of length @xmath10 , satisfying @xmath11 and @xmath12 = i\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } s_i^{\\gamma}$ ] .",
    "the first sum in eq .   runs over the nearest - neighbor bonds of a square lattice , while the second sum runs over the next - to - nearest - neighbor ( diagonal ) bonds on a staggered array of plaquettes ( see fig .  [ fig : lattice ] ) .",

    "the ground state properties of this system are equivalent to the 6-vertex model , displaying an exponential degeneracy of the ground state @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy is ( partially ) lifted when @xmath28 .    if @xmath6 we need to select among all zero - magnetization vertices with satisfied antiferromagnetic @xmath1 bonds",
    "this further constraint imposes that each vertex must take the antiferromagnetic ( nel ) configuration in fig .",

    "fig : vtype](a ) , reducing the ground state of the system to that of a 4-vertex model .",
    "the collinear ground states ( namely containing only collinear vertices ) are massively degenerate , because flipping a linear chain of spins along the @xmath2 diagonals does not alter any of the constraints which the ground state must satisfy .",

    "the degeneracy of the ice - rule states is partially lifted when @xmath28 , and ice - rule states are organized into a band with energy width ( per spin ) given by @xmath33    the above discussion is valid for an arbitrary value of the spin length @xmath10 , and in particular also in the classical limit @xmath34 , in which one can introduce continuous spins @xmath35 with unit length @xmath36 . on the other hand , we will see that the application of a transverse field introduces significant differences for the ground - state properties depending on the spin length @xmath10 .",

    "all the neighboring vertices of a flippable plaquette share with the plaquette a bond with zero magnetization , so that the plaquette flip will not alter the vertex magnetization .",

    "comparing the energy cost of a plaquette flip with that of a spin flip , we find that plaquette flips are the lowest - energy excitations in the parameter range @xmath48 , and outside of this range spin flips are instead the excitations with the lowest energy .      in this section",
    "we discuss the effect of a transverse field on classical continuous spins ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the corresponding ground state configurations will serve as a template for the spin - wave analysis in the quantum case .",

    "various claims exist in the literature @xcite that this hamiltonian will lift the degeneracy of ice - rule states in favor of the nel state , based on the fact that the nel state has the largest number of flippable plaquettes .",
    "in fact , this hamiltonian is completely off - diagonal for the ice - rule states , so that it can not favor a specific ice - rule state , but only a resonant superposition thereof . in particular",
    "a flippable plaquette , once flipped , turns its four neighboring vertices from nel configurations to collinear configurations or viceversa , namely the effective hamiltonian will resonantly connect local nel configurations with local collinear ones . at the same time , two corner - sharing flippable plaquettes can not be both flipped without leaving the ice - rule manifold , which suggests that nel - collinear resonances will be localized to single plaquettes . a rough approximation to the ground state of eq",

    "the common result of all these studies is that the ground state for weak quantum perturbations has indeed long - range rps order , and no magnetic order .",

    "interestingly the deviation between @xmath142 and @xmath139 builds up when approaching the quantum - critical field @xmath105 , showing that spin - wave theory is able to signal the quantum phase transition via the breakdown of the consistency of its results with known theorems .",
    "in this study we have applied a linear spin - wave theory analysis to the transverse - field ising model on the checkerboard lattice , which represents a paradigmatic example of a frustrated ising model with controlled quantum fluctuations .",
    "we find the remarkable result that harmonic quantum fluctuations are not able to lift the classical degeneracy , which is exponential in the linear dimension of the system when the next - to - nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath2 exceeds the nearest - neighbor one @xmath1 , and which is exponential in the system size for @xmath7 , corresponding to the square - ice limit .",
    "this implies that spin wave theory is inconclusive regarding the question of which classical ground state is selected by quantum effects , and that non - linear quantum fluctuations play a central role in lifting the degeneracy in the exact ground state .",
    "this result is consistent with existing studies of the square ice in a weak transverse field , for which degenerate perturbation theory and numerics suggest a quantum - disordered ground state with the structure of a resonating plaquette solid .",
    "our results suggest that a quantum - disordered ground state persists beyond this limit .",
    "spin - wave theory indicates an anomalous inversion in the classical hierarchy between reference states for strong fields and for @xmath143 , suggesting that quantum fluctuations beyond the harmonic approximation can destroy classical order in the system in that parameter range .",
    "moreover spin - wave theory breaks down completely close to the classical transition line to full polarization , where linear quantum fluctuations are able to suppress all spin components .",
    "this identifies an interesting candidate region for quantum - disordered ground states .",
    "recent experimental developments have led to controlled realizations of frustrated ising models , both in the classical limit and in the presence of tunable transverse fields .",
    "in particular the classical square - ice model , enriched with long - range dipolar interactions , is realized in recent experiments on square - lattice arrays of nano - patterned magnetic domains @xcite . while quantum tunneling of the magnetization in these systems is not realistic , given the mesoscopic size of the magnetic moments , one can envisage scaling down the components of these artificial ice systems to single - molecule magnets @xcite , which can be arranged into regular arrays on a surface @xcite .",
    "transverse - field ising models are currently realized by arrays of trapped ions @xcite , where the internal states of the ions can be coupled with ising hamiltonians via virtual phonons , and where transverse fields are created by raman laser schemes .",
    "the ions can be individually trapped by micro - traps , which can in turn be arranged into arbitrary planar arrays @xcite , encompassing the checkerboard geometry explored here as well as other frustrated structures .",
    "therefore the theoretical investigation of transverse - field ising models on frustrated lattices is very compelling , as it promises to lead to the realization of novel quantum states in controlled artificial spin systems in the near future .",

    "we present here several general formulas to study the quadratic quantum fluctuation in a generic transverse field ising system .",
    "we consider a generic classical ground state with long - range magnetic order , and with a magnetic unit cell containing @xmath67 spins .",
    "we denote @xmath68 the _",
    "p_-th spin ( @xmath69 ) of the _ l_-th cell .",
    "the most general hamiltonian supporting such a ground state has the form @xmath144_{pp'}s_{l , p}^{z}s_{l',p'}^{z } }      -\\gamma{\\displaystyle\\sum}_{i}{s_{l , p}^{x}}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath145 is the position of a reference site in the @xmath146th unit cell , and @xmath147 is a @xmath148 matrix containing the couplings between spins in unit cells at a distance @xmath149 .    in the classical limit an applied transverse field",
    "rotates the @xmath150-th spins around the @xmath66-axis by an angle @xmath151 . as already discussed in section [ lswham ] , we introduce a local rotation of the spin configuration , @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the orientation of the spin in zero field .",
    "the rotation has the effect of reducing the @xmath154 ground state to a perfectly ferromagnetic one .",
    "the classical energy of the @xmath150-th spin of each cell has the expression @xmath155_{pp'}\\sigma_{p'}\\cos\\vartheta_{p ' } -s\\gamma\\sin\\vartheta_{p},\\\\\\ ] ] so that the total classical energy can be written as @xmath156 where we have introduced the matrix @xmath157_{p , p ' } = \\varepsilon_{cl , p } \\delta_{p , p'}$ ] .",
    "we then consider small quantum fluctuations around this classical reference state , by transforming the quantum spins to bosons via a linearised holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite valid in the limit of a small number of bosons @xmath77 : @xmath158 here @xmath79 and @xmath80 are bosonic operators , satisfying @xmath81=1 $ ] and @xmath82=0 $ ] .",
    "the angles @xmath151 are chosen so that the classical reference state is stable .",
    "thus the linear terms in the bosonic operators vanish .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian then reads @xmath159 where @xmath160",
    "we then introduce the fourier transform of the bosonic operators and of the interaction @xmath161 the quadratic hamitonian can then be written in the compact form @xmath162 where @xmath163 this hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a @xmath67-mode bogolyubov transformation .",
    "this consists in finding the transformation @xmath164 , with @xmath165 , such that @xmath166 and @xmath167=1 $ ] and @xmath168=0 $ ] .",
    "we introduce the matrix @xmath169 , given by @xmath170 the matrix @xmath171 of the right eigenvectors of @xmath172 , and the unitary matrix @xmath173 such that @xmath174 .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath175 is then obtained as @xcite @xmath176 in particular , the eigenmodes @xmath177 are the eigenvalues of @xmath172 .    if the matrices @xmath178 and @xmath179 commute ( which is the case for the nel and collinear states of the checkerboard ising model studied here , having @xmath180 ) , the eigenmodes @xmath177 can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath181 of @xmath178 in the form @xmath182",
    "as mentioned above , in the particular case of the nel and collinear states of the checkerboard lattice ising model studied in this work , the classical energies @xmath183 are all equal to @xmath184 .",
    "the mean energy of the system then reads @xmath185 as @xmath178 is proportional to @xmath186 , so are its eigenvalues .",
    "we can then expand the mean energy per spin in powers of @xmath187 .",
    "we will introduce rescaled eigenvalues @xmath188 defined as @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath190 where the @xmath191 are defined by @xmath192 . in the case of a nel or a collinear case , the trace of @xmath178 averages to zero in the brillouin zone .",
    "thus the first non - zero correction to the classical energy in eq .",
    "is of fourth order in @xmath14 .    in both cases , if we introduce the ratio @xmath193 , we get @xmath194 where the @xmath195 coefficients only depend on @xmath196 , and not on the considered state .",
    "it is then obvious that the expansion becomes independent of the classical state if @xmath197 .",
    "thus the classical degeneracy of the ice model is not lifted by harmonic fluctuations .",
