    "the intensity of the transitions between the hubbard bands at about 2000  remains the same , though the contribution at about 300  rises as temperature increases above 35  k and the systems cross over into the semiconducting state .",
    "the spectral - weight shift towards lower frequencies on cooling from 300 to 50  k can be interpreted as a signature of `` getting closer '' to a metallic state ; this is illustrated by the monotonic decrease of the center of gravity of the spectra shown in fig .",

    "the behavior is distinctively different : the shift becomes more pronounced for the metallic samples with @xmath65 and 0.9 , while the opening of the mott - hubbard gap causes an upward shift of the center of gravity for @xmath0 and 0.4 .",

    "in contrast to single - site calculations , cluster dmft reveals these short - range correlations which reduce the critical coulomb repulsion @xmath18 ; most important in this context , additional low - frequency excitations are expected due to local singlet formation .",
