    "colloidal particles moving through a fluid create a flow that affects the movement of other particles in its vicinity .",
    "this interaction between colloidal particles is referred to as hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction of bulk suspensions is long - ranged and decays with inter - particle distance @xmath3 as @xmath14 @xcite . in many real circumstances , particles are not completely free , but spatially confined in some special environments , such as microfluidic devices , porous media , fluid interface and cell membrane@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics behaviors of confined colloidal suspensions are one of the current investigation focus . in 2000 , e. r. dufresne @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite measured the dynamic coupling of particle pair above a single flat wall using optical tweezers .",
    "their experimental results showed that while the distance of particles to the wall is about three times of particle radius , the hydrodynamics interaction between particle pair decays with @xmath3 as @xmath17 . in 2011 , p. l. pushkar @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite made a further investigation on many - body hydrodynamic interaction in the presence of a single wall by holographic optical tweezers and dynamic simulation .",
    "they found that the behaviors of hydrodynamic interactions between particle pair and multi - particle clusters are similar , i.e. , the hydrodynamics interaction between particles in clusters also decays with @xmath3 as @xmath17 .",
    "this results differ from that in bulk in which hydrodynamic screen appears in high particle concentration .",
    "b. cui @xmath15 @xmath16 investigated the hydrodynamic interaction between particles in a narrow channel @xcite and confined between two plates @xcite in 2002 and 2004 , respectively .",
    "they found that a linear channel sharply screens the hydrodynamic interaction ; and the hydrodynamic interaction of particles confined between two plane walls decays with @xmath3 as @xmath17 .",
    "perpendicular to the line joining the centers of particles confined between two plates the cross - correlation is negative , i.e. , particles exert anti - drag on one another in this direction .",
    "the circulation current is the direct cause for this negative coupling .",
    "the above works revealed the corrected dynamic characters of colloidal particles confined by hard wall .",
    "there is a non - slip boundary condition near a hard wall which could cut off the fluid field in its vicinity .",
    "the fluid interface is a slip boundary and may not cut off the fluid field .",
    "the influences of boundary condition reflect directly on the correlated dynamics of particles . because of the effects of the spatial symmetry breaking , the hydrodynamic interaction of particles at an air - water interface is different from that in symmetrical bulk . in 2006 , v. prasad @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite investigated the hydrodynamic interaction between particles at an air - water interface and found that there is a transition from three - dimension ( 3d ) to two - dimension ( 2d ) hydrodynamics with increasing surface viscosity @xmath18 . at high @xmath18 ,",
    "the correlated motion along the line joining the centers of particles @xmath2 , and ones perpendicular to this line @xmath5 are nearly equal and have logarithmic @xmath3 dependence . with the decrease of @xmath18 , the decay rate of @xmath2 and @xmath5 with @xmath3 increases and",
    "the their values begin to deviate . at low @xmath18 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . notwithstanding the differences in the behavior of @xmath2 , @xmath5 at high and low @xmath18",
    ", all the data sets can be scaled onto a single master curve by @xmath18 .",
    "evidently , the surface viscosity @xmath18 has a substantial influence on both @xmath2 and @xmath5 . in 2011 ,",
    "m. h. lee @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite investigated the correlated motion of particles at an oil - water interface .",
    "their experiment results also show a transformation from 3d to 2d hydrodynamics with the increase of @xmath18 . the results of prasad @xmath15 @xmath16 have the effect of fluid field only from one side ; and ones of lee @xmath15 @xmath16 have the influence of the fluid field from two side .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction between particles at an oil - water interface is influenced by the viscosity of the oil @xmath19 , water @xmath11 and interface @xmath20 . from the above ,",
    "we know that the dynamic characters of colloidal system in the confined condition exhibited much more rich physical image than that in the bulk .",
    "the investigations on the dynamics of confined colloidal suspensions have significant application in many important field , such as pharmacy and biological science etc . @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the influence of the hydrodynamic and coulomb interactions on dynamic characters of colloidal system when the boundary condition changes from the symmetry to completely asymmetry , such as air - water interface . in the previous experiment investigations about the hydrodynamic interactions between particles at an air(oil)-water interface the interface viscosity @xmath20",
    "was treated as an adjustment parameters . in this paper , we measured the cross correlation of colloidal interfacial diffusion under the different interfacial concentrations of weakly charged colloidal spheres , and investigate the influence of coulomb interaction between the spheres on the correlated motion .",
    "getting rid of the impurity from the aqueous surface , we make a clean air - water interface and investigate the correlated motions of silica spheres s1 ( @xmath21 ) , s2 ( @xmath22 ) and s3 ( @xmath23 ) at this pure interface by optical microscopy and multi - particle tracking .",
    "the experiment results show that the cross correlation of particles at pure air - water interface is stronger than that exhibited in the experiments of prasad @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xcite in the case of low @xmath18 .",
    "the correlated motion @xmath24 turns into @xmath25 when @xmath0 was from 0.03 to 0.35 .",
    "the particles used in our experiment are weakly charged silica spheres .",
    "coulomb interactions between particles enhanced the cross correlation of particles . with the increase of particles area fraction @xmath0 , the mean particle separation decreases and coulomb interactions increase .",
    "thus the cross correlation of particles enhances and the decay rate of @xmath2 and @xmath5 with @xmath3 decreases as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the correlated motion of particles as a function of inter - particle distance @xmath3 for different @xmath0 is presented .",
    "as discussed in the paper , the coulomb interaction between colloidal particles should serve as an effective surface viscoelastical role in our system . though the differences in the behavior of correlated motion for different @xmath0 and particles , with the scaled separation @xmath9 and correlation function @xmath26 , all the correlated motion can be scaled onto a single master curve . where @xmath27 and @xmath12 is termed as two - particle effective surface viscosity whose measurements agree well with that of one - particle surface viscosity @xmath13 .",
    "we present the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 as a function of the area fraction @xmath0 for different silica spheres .",
    "particles s3 exhibit an anomalous long - range correlation which we do not understand at present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to the description of the experiment setup and results . in section iii ,",
    "data analysis are presented . in section iv ,",
    "further discussions are given .",
    "finally , the work is summarized in section v.",
    "the particles used in the experiment are silica sphere 1 ( s1)with the diameter @xmath28 , silica sphere 2 ( s2 ) with the diameter @xmath29 and silica sphere 3 ( s3 ) with the diameter @xmath30 .",
    "the s1 and s3 particles were purchased from duke scientific and were synthesized by the stber method , followed by a sintering process at @xmath31 to drive off all organic materials and water .",
    "the particles s2 were purchased from bangs laboratories and are non porous spheres .",
    "we follow the same procedures as described in ref.[13 ] for the experimental setup and the sample preparation and cleaning .",
    "the sample cell is made from a stainless steel disk ( which is hydrophilic ) with a central hole of diameter 13 mm .",
    "the bottom of the hole is sealed with a 0.1 mm thick glass cover slip , which also serves as an optical window .",
    "the sidewall of the hole together with the bottom glass slip forms a container , which has an effective height of 1.0 mm .",
    "the top of the container has a sharp circular edge , which is used to pin the air - water interface and reduce unwanted drift .",
    "the entire cell is placed on the sample stage of an inverted microscope , so that the motion of the interfacial particles can be viewed from below and recorded by a digital camera .",
    "we take great care to clean the particle samples and the air - water interface .",
    "surface pressure measurements reveal that no detectable impurity is found in the cleaned particle samples .",
    "the particle - methanol solution is then injected onto a cleaned interface using a syringe pump .",
    "the silica spheres disperse well at the clean air - water interface .",
    "individual particles undergo vigorous brownian motion and remain stable at the interface for days .",
    "these particles remain in focus under high magnification , indicating that the silica spheres are strongly bound to the interface and their vertical position is determined by an energy minimum .",
    "the usual capillary effect is not applicable to micron - sized spheres for the gravitational energy of the particles is much smaller than the relevant energy of the interface , and particles can choose an equilibrium vertical position without introducing long - range deformations to the interface .    to obtain good images of the silica particles phase contrast microscopy",
    "using homemade software with a spatial resolution of 60 - 100 nm we construct particle trajectories from the consecutive images . from the particle trajectories ,",
    "we determine the vector displacements of the tracers @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the absolute time and @xmath34 is the lag time . in the experiment",
    ", we measure the mean cross - correlated particle motion [ 2 ] :    @xmath35 where @xmath36 are particle indicates , @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent different coordinates , and @xmath39 is the distance between particle @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "we focus on the diagonal elements of this tensor product : @xmath2 which indicates the correlated motion along the line joining the centers of particles , and @xmath5 which represents the correlated motion perpendicular to this line .    the correlated motion @xmath2 and @xmath5 are the function of @xmath3 and @xmath34 . the lag time @xmath34 need approach to zero to eliminate its effect on @xmath42 .",
    "there are two ways to calculate the @xmath34-independent quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which depend only on @xmath3 .",
    "firstly , if the data shows @xmath2 , @xmath45 within the observation period of @xmath34 , the slopes of @xmath2 , @xmath5 versus @xmath34 are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise , we calculate the partial differential of @xmath48 and @xmath49 from which we derived the corresponding slope value at @xmath50 by the extrapolation .",
    "we measured the curve of @xmath46 and @xmath47 vs. @xmath3 for dozens of different area fraction in range of 0.01 - 0.35 for the data of s1 .",
    "we make a coarse grain process by grouping the dozen of curves to range : 0.01 - 0.05 , 0.05 - 0.1 , 0.1 - 0.14 , 0.15 - 0.17 , 0.2 , 0.35 ( see the figures below ) .",
    "we average curves in each groups respectively .",
    "the similar processing procedure had also been down for the data of s2 and s3 .",
    "the results are obtained by averaging over @xmath51 particles , ensuring that the statistical averaging is adequate .",
    "figure 1 exhibits the measured values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for silica microspheres s1 scaled by @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 with the area fraction @xmath0 ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the bulk viscosity of water in room temperature .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the one- and two - particle measurements agree well with each other .",
    "the results confirm that the non - heterogeneity argument about our experiment system and the scaling method described in formula ( 4 ) are reasonable .",
    "but at present we do not derive the scaling relationship of formula ( 4 ) theoretically , which deserves further investigation .",
    "we vaguely guess the index @xmath129 may be related to the dimension feature of the effective surface viscosity , which dependents on both of the bulk and interface viscosities .",
    "most interesting phenomenon in the experiment is that the exponent @xmath68 and @xmath69 decrease when the colloidal area fraction @xmath0 increases .",
    "experiment results in fig . 1 indicate that the cross correlation between particles in our experiment is stronger than that exhibited in the experiments of prasad @xmath15",
    "@xcite even in the case of low @xmath18 . by all above analysis , the decrease of @xmath68 and @xmath69 value is correspond to the increase of the two - particle effective surface viscosity @xmath12 .",

    "these charged spheres at the air - water interface show a dlvo repulsive interaction @xcite . the interactions between silica spheres at air - water interface with low fraction @xmath0 include hydrodynamic and coulomb interactions . with the increase of @xmath0 , the mean particle separation @xmath131 decreases and the mean coulomb interactions between particles increase .",

    "here , we add an extra term of @xmath135 as a correction to the theory of equation ( 7 ) , since these silica spheres , especially samples s1 and s3 , experience a larger drag force than the value predicted by t.m.fishers theory @xcite .",

    "9 are the fitted curves described by formula ( 11 ) .",
    "the fitted values of parameters @xmath90 and @xmath89 are given in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath89 for samples s1 is nearly 2 times larger than that of s3 , and @xmath90 close to 4 times in the error range .",
    "these ratio between numbers are consistent well with the size ratio between the particles , considering the underlying physical meaning of @xmath90 and @xmath89 , viz",
    ". surface charge and immerse contact line .",
    "but for samples s2 , the values in table give a different story : a much larger @xmath90 vs. a much less @xmath89 .",
    "these two numbers are self consistent at least .",
    "more surface charge ( @xmath137 ) will give a shorter contact line ( @xmath138 ) , since high charged particles always immerse deeper .",
    "as mentioned above , the s2 particles were purchased from bangs laboratories , while s1 and s3 particles from duke scientific .",
    "both were synthesized in different ways @xcite .",
    "the difference in surface chemistry may introduce a different immersion ratio .    at a glance , this s2 immerse - deeper picture is sort of conflict with the fact that the @xmath108 value of s2 ( @xmath139 ) is higher than that of s1 and s3 ( @xmath140 ) when @xmath136 @xcite , viz .",
    "the particles s2 experience a relative less drag than s1 and s3 on the air - water interface in the dilute limit . while @xmath136 , the effective viscosity @xmath141 is composed of the bulk viscosity @xmath142 and interfacial viscosity @xmath143 .",
    "the short self - diffusion constant of particle could be written as :    @xmath144 where @xmath118 is the particle radius , and @xmath145 is the character length .",
    "the deeper the particles immerse , the larger the bulk viscosity @xmath142 contributes and the less the @xmath92",
    ". base on our data , the increase of @xmath142 might be overwhelmed by the decrease of @xmath92 when s2 immerse deeper .",
    "the @xmath145 in equation ( 12 ) should be same with the @xmath89 appeared in equation ( 11 ) , since both describe the interfacial viscosity @xmath92 when @xmath136 . regarding @xmath89 as the length of interfacial particle contact line , we could calculate the value of @xmath145 by substituting the fitting value of @xmath89 ( in table i ) and the value of @xmath106 ( in paper @xcite ) into the formula ( 8) and ( 12 ) .",
    "the calculation results show that @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 for samples s1 , s2 and s3 , respectively .",
    "the deviation between @xmath89 and @xmath145 is less than 15 and 30 percent for sample s1 and s3 , respectively .",
    "however , the sign of the @xmath145 is negative for s2 . with a long shot guess ,",
    "it maybe because that the particle s2 has a partially slip boundary condition due to its unique surface chemistry",
    ". then the fitting value of @xmath89 is not the real length of particles contact line , but a viscosity - effect - equivalent one , which could much less than the real contact length . by this",
    "underestimated @xmath89 , we could have a overestimated @xmath142 due to a deeper - immersion estimation of @xmath149 in equation ( 8) . in the end , we get a minus @xmath145 for sample s2 . but at present , we are unable to experimentally measure the exact length of the interfacial particle contact line independently .",
    "so we can not say anything much more here .    traditionally , particle concentration dependence of the bulk viscosity ( data points in fig .",
    "9 ) could be expressed by the polynomial @xcite . by analogy with the bulk case , we rewrite the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 as follows :    @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the fitting parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath151 represents the effective surface viscosity that a sphere experiences .",
    "the area fraction dependence of @xmath12 is represented by @xmath152 .",
    "the data points in fig .",
    "9 could also fitted very well by equation ( 13 ) .",
    "however , the fitted values of @xmath152 are very high and @xmath153 , indicating @xmath12 has a super strong area fraction dependence .",
    "such incredible high power exponent suggests that @xmath12 should exponentially increases with colloidal area fraction .",
    "we believe that the strong area fraction dependence of @xmath12 does arise from the coulomb interaction between particles .",
    "generally , figure 9 exhibits dependence of shear viscosity @xmath12 on particle concentration , which is directly related to cross - correlation of interfacial diffusion . with the increase of area fraction , the mean particle separation decreases and the electrostatic interaction between particles enhances .",
    "the enhancement of the electrostatic interaction causes the increase of correlated strength between particles .",
    "the increase of correlated strength corresponds to the increase of the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "we describe the electrostatic interaction between particles with the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "there are hydrodynamic and electrostatic interaction between particles in our experimental system .",
    "we call this interaction effective hydrodynamic interaction . with the increase of @xmath0 , the effective hydrodynamic interaction enhances mainly arising from the increase of coulomb interaction between particles .",
    "h. diamant @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite had demonstrated that many - body effects do not influence the hydrodynamic coupling at large distance in quasi - two - dimension ( q2d ) colloidal system for momentum diffusion does not contribute to the large - distance coupling .",
    "we also observed that the hydrodynamic interaction between hard sphere is independent of particle concentration in the two - dimension ( 2d ) system where the momentum leaks to the third dimension @xcite .",
    "another information given by fig .",
    "9 is size dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "first , we study the behavior of the shear viscosity @xmath12 for particles s1 and s3 both which were purchased from duke scientific with identical surface chemistry .",
    "it is shown that for the same area fraction the shear viscosity @xmath12 of small particles is slightly larger than that of large particles , i.e. , small particles experience a larger drag than large particles .",
    "one possibility is that smaller particles are separated by a smaller distance ( @xmath131 ) as compared to the larger particles at the same area fraction @xmath0 , and they may feel more effective hydrodynamic interactions at air - water interface than the larger particles do @xcite . compared with particles s1 and s3 , the s2 particles has very small shear viscosity @xmath12 , as mentioned above , which maybe come from the different surface chemistry .",
    "figure 3 ( b ) shows an anomalous long - rang correlation .",
    "while @xmath71 , the decay of @xmath52 and @xmath53 bates with increasing @xmath3 and does not follow power law . at large inter - particle region ,",
    "correlated motion are weakly dependent on @xmath3 and are roughly logarithmic ( too narrow data range to tell , indeed ) .",
    "the deviation of correlated motion from the master curve in the case of @xmath71 indicates another rules governed the system or something else ? at present , we do nt have an answer yet . during the experiment",
    ", we use 10 - 100 image sequences , each contains 100 images , to calculate @xmath2 and @xmath5 , and the result is further averaged over repeated runs ( 10@xmath15420 runs ) .",
    "this corresponds to an average over @xmath155 particles , ensuring that the statistical averaging is adequate .",
    "we conduct the measurements at different times with separately prepared air - water interface .",
    "the identical experiment equipments and measurement methods are used for all the three particle samples .",
    "thus , this anomalous long - rang interaction sounds unlikely caused by inaccurate measurements .",
    "but this anomalous correlation occurs only at smallest colloidal s3 system .",
    "the diffusion constants of s3 particles is relative larger than two others samples due to the smaller size .",
    "an improved microscopy system with even higher time and spacial resolution might be necessary to clarify this phenomenon .",
    "in this paper , we systematically investigated the spatial correlated motion of weakly charged silica spheres at a pure air - water interface .",
    "three kinds of silica particles are used in the experiment : silica 1 ( s1 ) with the diameter @xmath21 purchased from duke scientific , silica 2 ( s2 ) with the diameter @xmath22 purchased from bangs laboratories and silica 3 ( s3 ) with the diameter @xmath23 purchased from duke scientific .",
    "optical microscopy and multi - particle tracking are used to measure @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a function of the inter - particle distance @xmath3 with various values of particle concentration for particles s1 , s2 and s3 .",
    "correlation function @xmath46 and @xmath47 decay with inter - particle distance @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively , for particles s1 with @xmath1 . with the increase of @xmath0 , the decay of correlated motion with @xmath3 becomes slow ( fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we attribute it as that the cross correlation is enhanced by the coulomb interaction between particles .",
    "we describe the electrostatic interaction between particles at the interface with the effective surface viscosity @xmath92 .    following the scaling method given by prasad @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xcite , we scale the curves with various values of @xmath0 onto a single master curve by @xmath79 and @xmath78 .",
    "the measurements results show that @xmath78 is clearly deviated from @xmath79 for a certain area fraction ( fig .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath79 and @xmath78 even exceeds 50 percent in the case of large @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath78 suggests that we should rescale the separation according to formula ( 4 ) . with this new scaling method",
    "the curves with different area fraction can be scaled onto a single master curve by one set of parameter values of two - particle effective viscosity @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "the measurements of effective surface viscosity @xmath12 and @xmath13 agree well with each other ( fig .",
    ". the behaviors of cross correlation for particles s1 , s2 and s3 are similar and their master curve can also fall on a single curve except the large @xmath3 region of s3 ( fig .",
    "the experimental results indicate that our new scaling method is reasonable and could be used in similar experiment system .",
    "but presently we do not deduce theoretically the scaling relationship described in formula ( 4 ) , which deserves further investigation , and also can not understand the anomalous long - rang correlation exhibited by particles s3 at large inter - particle distance region ( fig.3 ( b ) ) .",
    "the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 as a function of @xmath0 for samples s1 , s2 and s3 are presented ( fig .",
    "9 ) . for samples",
    "s1 and s3 with identical surface chemistry , @xmath12 of small particles is slightly larger than that of large one for the same area fraction",
    ". however , the viscosity @xmath12 of particles s2 is extraordinary small compared with that of s1 and s3 .",
    "the difference of surface chemistry characteristic and immersion depth between particles s1 , s3 and s2 may be the two possibilities causing the discrepancy of the viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "the experimental data about the effective surface viscosity @xmath12 presented in the paper are helpful for the related theoretical investigation . referring to the form of the interaction potential between particles , we present a exponential fitting formula ( equation ( 11 ) ) , which is more physically reasonable than the traditional polynomial form , for the viscosity @xmath12 .",
    "the decay of the correlated motion with @xmath3 for lowest @xmath0 in this paper is slower than that of ref.[10 ] with low surface viscosity .",
    "we argue that the high sensitivity of electrostatic interaction between particles on area fraction results in this deviation . with the increase of @xmath0 ,",
    "the electrostatic interaction enhances and the slope of correlated motion vs. @xmath3 decreases , which confirm our argument .",
    "we increase the coulomb interaction between particle by increasing the area fraction @xmath0 . though we have known that many - body effects would not influence the hydrodynamic interaction of particles , the method varying coulomb interaction between particles in the paper is indirect .",
    "we will change the surface charge of particles directly to investigate the effects of coulomb interaction on correlated motion in the next experiment to further confirm our argument .",
