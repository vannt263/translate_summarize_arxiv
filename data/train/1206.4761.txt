    "<S> it is a fundamental paradigm that the physical effects induced by electric fields are qualitatively different from those induced by magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that electrons at a dirac point in bilayer graphene experience an unusual type of electromagnetism where magnetic and electric fields are virtually equivalent : every coupling of an electron s degrees of freedom to a _ magnetic _ field is matched by an analogous coupling of the _ same _ degrees of freedom to an _ electric _ field . </S>",
    "<S> this counter - intuitive duality of matter - field interactions enables novel ways to create and manipulate spin and pseudo - spin polarizations in bilayer graphene via external fields and leads to the emergence of a valley - contrasting axion electrodynamics , where the traditional association of charges at rest with electric fields and charge currents with magnetic fields is reversed . </S>"
