    "good estimates of how many people frequently travel between two places is related to several areas of study .",
    "it is not only a key ingredient in modeling the spreading of infectious diseases @xcite , but also a fundamental problem in geo - spatial economics of facility distribution and transportation planning .",
    "clues on the statistics of human movements and their changes at different scales are thus fundamental . here we explore statistical expressions to calculate the number of commuting trips within areas of sizes ranging from a few kilometers ( one city or town ) to over one thousand kilometers ( one country ) .",
    "we focus on commuting trips because they are stable in time and account for the largest fraction of the total flows in a population .    in order to describe the commuting flow patterns of people , various aggregated trip distribution models",
    "have been proposed @xcite . among all these efforts ,",
    "the gravity model , which assumes that the number of movements between an origin - destination pair decays with their distance , is the most widely used one @xcite .",
    "the gravity model can be further divided into the unconstrained gravity model @xcite , the singly constrained gravity model ( such as the b.p.r model @xcite , or the voorhees gravity model @xcite ) and the doubly constrained gravity model @xcite .",
    "more constraints generally leads to better model performance .",
    "the doubly constrained gravity model fits parameters in an iterative way to best reconstruct the empirical od matrix .",
    "but the iterative fitting complicates the calibration of the distance decaying function , which is essential for the gravity model . however , the most important limitation of the doubly constrained gravity model is the calibrated parameters from the empirical trip data in one area lack meaningful interpretation and thus are not transferable to other regions . as a consequence , in current epidemiology studies",
    "the more generalizable but less accurate unconstrained gravity model is often used  @xcite .    from another perspective",
    ", the recently proposed radiation model @xcite has an analytical formulation that estimates trip volumes without parameters ; using as input the distribution of population only .",
    "it takes inspiration from the intervening opportunity model , which assumes that the trip volume is more related to the number of opportunities between the origin and the destination instead of just to their distance @xcite . as is recently shown by simini _",
    "@xcite , the radiation model represents a general framework that includes the intervening opportunity model as a degenerated case and it is linked with the the gravity model through the spatial distribution of opportunities .",
    "the model was originally developed to predict inter - county flows , which not necessarily account for daily trips .",
    "some recent works  @xcite have shown that the parameter - free radiation model  @xcite does not work well at predicting intra - city trips .",
    "two of these works  @xcite introduced models with a calibrating parameter as a cost function of the distance to reproduce intra city trips . in the gravity model based",
    "approach  @xcite a scaling parameter depending on region size is introduced ; while in intervening opportunity model based approaches introducing such an interpretable parameter that can be estimated without trip data remains an open question .",
    "the present work seeks to answer two questions : how the value of the parameter that imposes the scale dependency can be interpreted and estimated without trip data ? under",
    "which conditions the prediction of models not calibrated with empirical trip data would work ?",
    "the extended radiation model that we present in this study is distinct from previous formulations , in that it is a stochastic model that depends on the distributions of opportunities and population only .",
    "the one scaling parameter @xmath0 depends on the region size and the heterogeneity of opportunity distribution , which makes it interpretable and estimable in many cases even without trip data .",
    "the extended radiation model is derived by relating the trip production and attraction process to survival analysis .",
    "we propose an analogy between survival time @xmath1 and the number of opportunities @xmath2 a commuter has considered .",
    "another important ingredient for modelling trips within small scales ( intra urban trips ) is the separation between population density and trip attraction rates .",
    "most models on intra - city trips use the density of population  @xcite as a proxy for both trip generation and trip attraction rates .",
    "while this approximation is reasonable at large scales , at inner city scale trip attraction is better represented by the density of point of interests ( pois ) , defined as geolocated non residential establishments presented on a digital map .",
    "the proposed model combines the closed analytical form of the original radiation model and the flexibility of gravity - like models .",
    "while it can be calibrated when empirical trip data is available , it also provides an analytical parameter estimation when there is no trip data for calibration .",
    "the model is validated in the u.s . by the census commuting data and in three other countries ( portugal , dominican republic , and rwanda ) by cell phone records .",
    "the simplest form of the gravity model is@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the flow between zone @xmath5 and @xmath6 . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the population of the two zones .",
    "@xmath9 is the distance between them and @xmath10 is a distance decaying function . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are parameters to be fitted from data .",
    "@xmath13 is an adjustment parameter controlling the sum of the flows .",
    "this is usually called the unconstrained gravity model because it does not guarantee the attainment of the desired generation and attraction marginal volumes in each zone .    in transportation planning",
    ", the gravity model usually takes the form @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total trip production and attraction volumes of zones @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . for a study region with @xmath17 zones , there are @xmath18 parameters of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these parameters are calculated by iteratively applying : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this is called the doubly constrained gravity model because it ensures consistent values of the trip production @xmath23 , and trip attraction @xmath24 per zone . in order to calibrate the @xmath19 and @xmath20 parameters ,",
    "the model requires accurate input of the total trip production and attraction volumes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "an alternative model that does not require calibration is the recently proposed radiation model , in which @xmath4 takes the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the population within the circle of radius @xmath9 centered at zone @xmath5 ( not including the population in zones @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) and the rest of the notations are the same as in the gravity model .",
    "we explore the suitability of the doubly constrained gravity model and the radiation model on predicting commuting flows at three different scales : the western u.s .",
    ", the entire san francisco bay area , and the city of san francisco ( see methods ) .",
    "we apply the doubly constrained gravity model with power distance decay function @xmath27 ( which is better than the exponential decay function in the example regions ) and compare it with the radiation model .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the commuting distance distribution @xmath28 of different models at the three scales of study .",
    "when we compare inter - county trips in the western u.s . both the parameter - free radiation model and the calibrated gravity model with @xmath29 parameters perform similarly . adjusting the @xmath19 ,",
    "@xmath20 and the parameter @xmath30 in the distance decaying function can not fit the model well for both short distance trips and long distance trips .",
    "this confirms the results reported in  @xcite .    however , when trying to predict the commuting flows among zones within the bay area or san francisco , without parameters for calibration the situation is much harder because the density of population is more homogeneously distributed and commuters tend to go to various business districts across the area ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such scale of daily trips is where the calibration parameters start playing an important role and the calibrated gravity model performs better than the parameter - free radiation model . in order to inspect further this situation , the distribution of the total number of opportunities @xmath2 between trip origin and destination",
    "is calculated .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows that at the bay area scale ( zone size @xmath31 ) , there is a region @xmath32 where there is not a clear functional form on the enclosing number of opportunities @xmath2 between the origin and the destination ( @xmath33 is the average number of opportunities in a zone ) .",
    "while for @xmath34 the probability of finding a trip start monotonically decaying .",
    "this effect of clear decaying behavior for @xmath34 is not observed in commuting trips within san francisco .",
    "based on these observations we look for a way to introduce the effects of scale on the radiation model .      we introduce a scaling parameter @xmath0 by combining the derivation of the original radiation model with survival analysis .",
    "survival analysis uses statistical methods to deal with the analysis of time to events , such as life time distribution of living organisms or machine components @xcite .",
    "the two objects of primary interest are the survival function and the hazard function .",
    "the survival function , @xmath35 , represents the life time distribution of an entity : @xmath36 @xmath35 is the cumulative probability of having survived after time @xmath1 .",
    "the hazard function , @xmath37 , represents the conditional death rate at time @xmath1 : @xmath38 different forms of hazard function @xmath37 will lead to different survival function @xmath35 .",
    "the two most generally used hazard functional forms are @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath39 leads to the exponential survival function @xmath41 , while @xmath40 leads to the weibull survival function @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 the hazard function does not depend on time @xmath1 , this is the effect that we would like to replicate for smaller zones : job selection has low dependence on the number of opportunities between home and the selected work location .",
    "the intervening opportunity model can be derived under the survival analysis framework if we think of the departure from origin as birth and the arrival at the destination as death while the lifetime is measured as the number of opportunities , @xmath2 , between the origin and the destination .",
    "the survival function @xmath44 represents the cumulative probability of not finding a workplace within @xmath2 opportunities .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 are exactly the two most commonly used intervening opportunity models @xcite . note here that @xmath0 controls the slope of the decay of @xmath44 .",
    "we show here the radiation model can also be derived under the survival analysis framework .",
    "if @xmath47 represents the probability of not accepting the closest @xmath2 opportunities , it has the same meaning of the survival function @xmath35 in the survival analysis .",
    "a person commuting from a region of @xmath7 opportunities to a region of @xmath8 opportunities with @xmath48 opportunities in between , can be expressed as the conditional probability of accepting one of the @xmath8 opportunities between @xmath2 and @xmath49 , given that the closest @xmath7 opportunities are not chosen .",
    "note that @xmath50 for eq .",
    "[ eq : radiation ] . this probability can be written as : @xmath51 then the core question becomes how to get the expression of @xmath47 .",
    "different individuals should have different hazard rates ( or job expectations in this case ) @xcite , we can assign different parameter @xmath52 value to different individuals @xmath5 .",
    "so the survival function of the entire population from a given origin becomes : @xmath53=\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}e^{-\\lambda a}p(\\lambda)d\\lambda\\ ] ] if we define @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 which gives the radiation model expression introduced in eq.[eq : p1mna ] ( we are using the same notation as in @xcite ) .",
    "one reason of choosing @xmath57 to be an exponential distribution is it connects the survival analysis with the derivation of the original radiation model @xcite .",
    "we further elaborate the influence of the form of the @xmath57 distribution in the si appendix .",
    "if we extend the analysis to the weibull survival function , we get : @xmath58 eq .",
    "[ eq : p1mna ] becomes : @xmath59(n_i^\\alpha+1)}{(a_{ij}^\\alpha+1)[(a_{ij}+n_j)^\\alpha+1 ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to calculate the flows between two zones @xmath5 and @xmath6 , two normalization constants are needed : @xmath60 since not all people are commuting and also the commuting within each zone is not counted , @xmath13 is the percentage of population that is commuting between different zones in the study area .",
    "@xmath61 is the population at the origin .",
    "if the empirical trip data or cell phone records ( as will be shown in the sections below ) are available , @xmath13 can be calculated from the total number of observed trips .",
    "if neither data source is available , the flow distribution can still be calculated because @xmath13 does nt influence the relative ratio of flows between different od pairs .",
    "the denominator in the equation is a normalization constant for finite sized area .",
    "the influence of the border effect and how this formulation can solve some of the limitations in previous models is detailed in the si appendix .",
    "the extended radiation model is calibrated to the three regions examined in the previous section .",
    "the obtained @xmath0 values are @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "we use the common part of commuters ( cpc ) , based on the srensen index @xcite , to quantitatively measure the goodness of flow estimation .",
    "@xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "this index shows which part of the commuting flow is correctly estimated , 0 means no agreement found and 1 means perfect estimation .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows that the extended radiation model gives estimations with similar performance to the doubly constrained gravity model at the three regions while the original radiation model s estimation power decays with the region granularity .",
    "the goodness of fit of the extended radiation model is close to other recently proposed models  @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the study in  @xcite uses actual commuting flow generation and attraction volumes as input , while in the current model we use more easily acquired population and poi density as proxies , but achieved the same level of accuracy .",
    "the @xmath47 distribution plays an important role in the formulation and @xmath0 parameter calibration , thus worths further scrutiny .",
    "when the space is infinite and the opportunities are continuous @xmath68 is a monotonically decreasing function with slope given by the @xmath0 value .",
    "but if we are considering trips only within a finite sized region , this implies a finite numbers of opportunities possible , up to @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath70 .",
    "also , we divide a study region into a finite number of zones @xmath71 , so @xmath2 can only take a set of discrete values .",
    "we define @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is the smallest number of opportunities in all the zones .",
    "since within zone trips are not considered , @xmath47 should start to decrease after @xmath73 .",

    "the detailed explanation is in the rest of this section .",

    "@xmath97 most commonly accounts for inter city trips , the model without data calibration is expected to predict trips well because of the narrow error bar . for larger scale regions enclosing trips between two or more combined statistical areas such as the ones shown in fig . 4",
    ", @xmath79 and has a wide range .",
    "we notice that the main driving factor influencing the @xmath0 value for the same scale is the differences in the homogeneity of facility density ; which are highly correlated to population density at these large scales .    in fig .",
    "4 , the two marked regions have the same scale : @xmath98 km .",

    "the population is more homogeneously distributed .",

    "but in the census there are only @xmath99 people commuting from los angeles to lake havasu city while there are @xmath100 commuting from seattle to wenatchee .",
    "the reason is quite clear on the map : the distance from seattle to wenatchee is only @xmath101 km while the distance from los angeles to lake havasu city is much longer because of the low population / opportunity density between the origin and the destination . to put it in another way , people have to travel further to be able to explore the same amount of opportunities .",
    "this causes the calibrated @xmath0 value of the southern region to be @xmath102 , much larger than the northern one , which is @xmath103 . as is shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the more heterogeneous the distribution of population is ; the larger the difference in @xmath73 and @xmath33 is and the larger the @xmath0 value becomes . in those cases",

    "[ patheo ] and empirical trip data is needed for parameter calibration .",
    "more quantitative ways to measure the influence of the degree of heterogeneity as a cost function depending on the distance between the origin and the destination remains an open question for further studies .",
    "people s location choices are not influenced by the choice of study region sizes . what the parameter @xmath0 captures for the scale dependency is the granularity of aggregation . ideally the location choice should be modeled to the smallest spatial granularity , then aggregated to the desired granularity level .",
    "but in practice such fine grained input data are usually not available , in such cases the @xmath0 parameter helps the model estimation at the desired granularity directly , without requiring finer grained data .    in summary , even without empirical trip od data , if the commuting zones are in the range @xmath104 , it can be expected for the extended radiation formula to give good commuting flow prediction . in these cases eq .",
    "[ eq : la ] gives us : @xmath105 . for zones with large sizes ,",

    "in other situations the model needs to be calibrated with empirical od data .",
    "not many countries in the world have detailed census data for commuting flow prediction and model calibration . those countries with data scarcity are often developing countries that need this kind of modeling the most .",
    "for these countries finding an alternative data source to provide guidance for their urban growth , economic planning and epidemics controlling is a pressing need . in this section",
    "we show how the extended radiation and the gravity model can be calibrated given estimated commuting trips measured from cell phone data .",

    "[ eq : la ] to explore the generality of that expression .",
    "cell phone records are increasingly showing the potential to become a data source of valuable information @xcite since most populated areas have cell phone service coverage and the value of cell phone data in modeling human mobility has recently been highlighted in various studies @xcite .",
    "for instance , in rwanda there is no detailed commuting census data available .",

    "<S> the estimation of commuting flows at different spatial scales is a fundamental problem for different areas of study . </S>",
    "<S> many current methods rely on parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes . </S>",
    "<S> their values are often not generalizable to cases without calibration data . to solve this problem </S>",
    "<S> we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical trip data is not available . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from within a city to an entire country , introducing a scaling parameter @xmath0 to the recently proposed parameter free radiation model . </S>",
    "<S> the model requires only widely available population and facility density distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of heterogeneity in the facility distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we explore in detail the scaling limitations of this problem , namely under which conditions the proposed model can be applied without trip data for calibration . on the other hand , when empirical trip data is available , we show that the proposed model s estimation accuracy is as good as other existing models . </S>",
    "<S> we validated the model in different regions in the u.s . </S>",
    "<S> , then successfully applied it in three different countries . </S>"
