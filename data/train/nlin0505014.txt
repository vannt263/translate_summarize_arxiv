    "convection in binary miscible fluids like ethanol - water , @xmath0he @xmath1he , or various gas mixtures is an example of systems that show rich and interesting pattern formation behavior when driven away from equilibrium .",
    "it is paradigmatic for problems related to instabilities , bifurcations , selforganisation , complex spatiotemporal behavior , and turbulence .",
    "compared to convection in one - component fluids the spatiotemporal properties are far more complex .",
    "the reason is that concentration variations which are generated via thermodiffusion , i.e. , the soret effect by externally imposed and by internal temperature gradients influence the buoyancy , i.e. , the driving force for convective flow .",
    "the latter in turn mixes by advectively redistributing concentration .",
    "this nonlinear advection gets in developed convective flow typically much larger than the smoothening by linear diffusion  pclet numbers measuring the strength of advective concentration transport relative to diffusion are easily of the order thousand .",
    "thus , the concentration balance is strongly nonlinear giving rise to strong variations of the concentration field and to boundary layer behavior .",
    "in contrast to that , momentum and heat balances remain weakly nonlinear close to onset as in pure fluids implying only smooth and basically harmonic variations of velocity and temperature fields as of the critical modes . without the thermodiffusive soret coupling between temperature and concentration field initial concentration deviations from the mean diffuse away and influence no longer the balances of the other fields [ such a system displays close to onset only the familiar stationary benard rolls that are called for historical reasons states of stationary overturning convection ( soc ) ] .    hence , the feedback interplay between ( _ i _ ) the soret generated concentration variations , ( _ ii _ ) the resulting modified buoyancy , and ( _ iii _ ) the strongly nonlinear advective transport and mixing causes binary mixture convection to be rather complex with respect to its spatiotemporal properties and its bifurcation behavior .",
    "take for example the case of negative soret coupling , @xmath2 , between temperature and concentration fields @xcite .",
    "then the above described feedback interplay generates oscillations .",
    "in fact the buoyancy difference in regions with different concentrations was identified already in @xcite as the cause for traveling wave convection .",
    "oscillatory convection appears in the form of the transient growth of convection at supercritical heating , in spatially extended relaxed nonlinear traveling wave ( tw ) and standing wave ( sw ) solutions that branch subcritically out of the conductive state via a common hopf bifurcation , and in spatially localized traveling wave ( ltw ) states .",

    "spatially localized convection states were obtained in domains of size up to 160 . to measure the strength of the thermal driving we use the reduced rayleigh number @xmath44 that is scaled by the critical rayleigh number @xmath45 for onset of pure - fluid convection with the critical wave number @xmath46 .",
    "the analytical values are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "however , to enable comparison with experimental , analytical , or numerical results we scale @xmath49 by the threshold @xmath45 in question , e.g. , of the finite differences numerical code @xcite .    to characterize convection we monitored among others the evolution of the spatial maximum of the vertical velocity field @xmath50 , of the oscillation frequency , and of the reduced variance @xmath51 of the concentration field .",

    "the better it is mixed the smaller is the spatial mean @xmath53 of the square of the concentration deviation from its mean  for spatially localized convection states @xmath54 is defined slightly differently , cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : ltw ] .",
    "the boundary conditions , however , sustain always small soret - induced concentration gradients against the action of advection and diffusion and prevents @xmath54 from vanishing completely . on the other hand , in the conductive state ( denoted by the subscript `` cond '' ) with a soret - induced vertical concentration stratification given by @xmath55 , there is no advective mixing .",

    "the system shows a subcritical hopf bifurcation with a hopf frequency @xmath64 . here",
    "two facts are worth mentioning : ( i ) the bifurcation threshold and the frequency are practically the same as for the critical waves with the critical wave number @xmath65 and ( ii ) tws with wavelength @xmath66 are often observed in large - scale experimental setups .",

    "the respective onset values for the phase velocities @xmath68 depend only weakly on the wave number @xmath69 .",
    "the curves @xmath70 are shifted to higher values with increasing negative @xmath31 due to the higher soret - induced concentration contrast in the conductive state .",
    "the saddle node lines @xmath71 are more or less downwards shifted versions of @xmath67 .",
    "the size of the interval , @xmath72 , of subcritical tws increases when @xmath31 becomes more negative . for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : twonsetsaddles ] the tw branches end at large amplitudes in a well mixed state of vanishing frequency by merging with the stationary soc solution branch of the same wavelength . for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] this happens at @xmath73 where the soc solution branch is included for convenience as well .",
    "in contrast to the tw solutions , the sws remain unstable at least against a transition into a ( transient ) tw .",
    "their solution branches ( cf . sec .",
    "[ sec : sw ] ) end in period dubling cascades @xcite .      when moving along the tw and sw solution branches in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] the frequency @xmath59 and the tw phase velocity @xmath74 decrease monotonically starting from the large hopf value at the bifurcation threshold .",
    "this is related to the advective reduction of the soret generated concentration gradients .",
    "in fact there is a universal linear relation between the degree of mixing and the frequency @xmath59 which holds for weakly nonlinear as well as for strongly nonlinear states and for transients alike .",
    "see for example @xcite for tws , @xcite for ltws , and @xcite for transients .",
    "this scaling relation @xmath75 holds also for sws as one can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig : mvsom ] . also tws with wavelength different from 2",
    "show roughly this scaling .",
    "in particular on the stable , strongly nonlinear tw solution branch the binary fluid gets with increasing @xmath58 and thermal driving @xmath60 more and more mixed and @xmath54 reduces almost to zero  only concentration gradients in the narrow boundary layers survive .",
    "this holds even more so for the well mixed soc states ( see e.g. the soc2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] which is marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] by the filled triangle ) that resemble closely the corresponding stationary state in the pure fluid with the same @xmath76 and @xmath60 .",
    "the transition to convection at @xmath77 is hysteretic , i.e. , of first order because the soret coupling coefficient @xmath78 is sufficiently negative .",
    "the associated precipitous growth of convection is caused by an interplay between the solutal contribution to the buoyancy @xcite that tends to stabilize the conductive state and the effect of advective mixing .",
    "the latter enhances convection by reducing the adverse effect of the soret generated concentration variations .",
    "there occurs an `` s''-shaped deformation of the unstable part of the tw bifurcation branch [ dashed ( blue ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] ] when the advection velocity @xmath58 has grown to become equal to the tw phase velocity @xmath79 .",
    "then the first closed streamlines appear @xcite in the frame of reference that is comoving with the tw phase velocity and where the tw solution is time independent .",
    "this is indeed a characteristic feature of strongly nonlinear tw convection , cf . further below .    for @xmath80 ,",
    "i.e. , closer to the threshold @xmath77 all streamlines are open and the field structures look almost harmonic  see the tw1 plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] .",
    "this weakly nonlinear tw , marked by an open circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] , is just at the border @xmath81 .",
    "this condition marks also the border line beyond which a straightforward small - amplitude expansion around the convective onset breaks down @xcite .",
    "in addition the generic _ transient growth _ dynamics of oscillatory convection ( consisting initially of oppositely traveling waves of roughly equal velocity amplitudes @xmath82 ) undergoes a dramatic change that can not be described at all with amplitude equation models when the flow amplitudes @xmath83 approach the border line value of @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the qualitative change in the flow topology between weakly and strongly nonlinear tws causes a different mixing behavior with increasing amplitude .",
    "this is the reason for the `` s''-shaped deformation of the unstable part of the tw bifurcation branch [ dashed ( blue ) line in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] ] .",
    "it becomes more pronounced with @xmath31 becoming more negative ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : biftw_ltw ] ) . eventually the strongly nonlinear tw solution branch develops a bistable part there on which fast tws are located @xcite .    for relaxed tws with @xmath85 the remaining open streamlines",
    "are spatially correlated with inner boundary layers of the concentration field .",
    "as indicated in the tw2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] they meander along the ( green ) regions of mean concentration , @xmath86 , between and around the roll - like regions of closed streamlines . in",
    "a right - propagating tw the regions of closed streamlines for the right ( left ) turning fluid domains are rich ( poor ) in the lighter component - here ethanol - and they are displaced towards the upper cold ( lower warm ) plate , where the soret effect maintains a boundary layer with alcohol surplus ( deficiency ) .",
    "in addition the meandering open streamlines lie between the upper ( lower ) closed streamline regions and the opposite bottom ( top ) concentration boundary layer .",
    "this structure of closed and open streamlines causes the top ( bottom ) boundary layer to feed high ( low ) concentration only into the right ( left ) turning roll domain at the location of downflow ( upflow ) .",
    "then the fluid becomes diffusively homogenized in the closed streamline regions of the rolls leading to anharmonic concentration profiles of trapezoidal shape shown in the top plot of the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] .",
    "the motion of the rolls with their specific concentration distribution implies a mean concentration current which is directed to the right in the upper and to the left in the lower half of the layer .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of this current .",
    "with increasing @xmath58 and decreasing @xmath87 the regions of closed streamlines grow at the expense of the open ones . thereby ,",
    "the former also come closer to the respective opposing boundary layer .",
    "this decreases the asymmetry of the boundary layer feeding into oppositely turning rolls . as a consequence",
    "the concentration contrast between adjacent tw rolls decreases until in the soc state with @xmath88 the rolls are fed symmetrically by both boundary layers and mirror symmetry between the rolls is established .",
    "socs and sws are laterally mirror symmetric around positions of maximal up- and downflow , e.g. @xmath36=0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] , and the node locations of the fields are fixed in time .",
    "this symmetry is broken in tws ",
    "see , e.g. , the concentration contrast between left and right turning rolls in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparestruct ] .",
    "but all fields of socs , sws , and tws have at every instant definite parity under the mirror - glide ( mg ) operation @xmath89 of vertical reflection at mid - height , @xmath37=0 , combined with lateral translation by half a wavelength .",
    "we did not observe sws without this symmetry ",
    "perturbations breaking it that we introduced for test purposes always decayed rapidly to zero .",
    "furthermore , all transients investigated in @xcite obeyed the mg symmetry with the exception of the very early stage in cases where the imposed initial conditions were not mg symmetric . but",
    "even then the mg symmetry was rapidly restored by a fast decay of mg symmetry - breaking modes .",
    "also the transient growth seen in the experiments in an annular geometry by winkler and kolodner @xcite was locally mg symmetric .",
    "a time dependent generalization of this symmetry was found to be realized in ltw states @xcite and an extension to 3d patterns was observed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mg symmetric convective structures were not only observed in soret driven convection with only temperature gradients imposed but also in thermosolutal convection @xcite .",
    "thus , the mg symmetry that is displayed by the basic conductive state and by the linear critical convective modes seems to be quite robust and also persistent in non - linear convective structures of pure fluids and of mixtures .",
    "the robustness of this symmetry is remarkable given that the nonlinearity in the concentration balance , i.e. , the peclet number @xmath90 is quite large  of the order of 1000 .",
    "however , the concentration field is `` tamed '' by being coupled to the velocity and temperature fields .",
    "their shape remains mostly harmonic for small supercritical thermal driving like in pure fluid convection .",
    "and thus the increase in structural complexity associated with a mg symmetry breaking does not occur .    finally , the sw fields start at onset to have in addition a definite mirror - timeshift symmetry ( mts ) , e.g. , @xmath91 for @xmath92 , and the vertical velocity field @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the sw oscillation period . at mid - height",
    "the condition @xmath95 implies in particular that positive and negative field extrema of an oscillation cycle have equal magnitudes .",
    "sws with smaller frequency that are located in the end region of the sw solution branches break this symmetry ( cf .",
    "[ sec : sw ] ) .",
    "this is a prerequisite for period doubling @xcite .",
    "here we review the supercritical spatiotemporal behavior of sw transients .",
    "we start from the quiescent conductive state at @xmath96 , disturb it slightly by adding small random numbers in the range of @xmath97 $ ] , and simultaneously increase the control parameter @xmath60 slightly above threshold as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifuebersicht ] .",
    "then one observes a generic transition scenario that occurs similarly also in analogous experiments .",
    "it consists of three evolution phases that we have found to be generic for convective growth out of small unspecific perturbations : ( _ i _ ) an exponentially growing sw of high frequency over a time interval the length of which depends on the size of the initial perturbations of the conductive state , ( _ ii _ ) an intermediate phase that is always very short with a spatiotemporally complicated transformation from sw into a high - frequency tw and finally ( _ iii _ ) a long - term tw transient to a low - frequency , strongly nonlinear , relaxed tw or soc state depending on @xmath60 @xcite .    in generic ,",
    "i.e. , non specific initial perturbations that break the mirror symmetry @xmath98 only weakly the two critical oscillatory modes of right and left traveling waves that can grow above the hopf threshold are contained with roughly equal amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "thus , initially , i.e. , as long as linear theory applies , the two critical tw modes that started with @xmath82 grow exponentially and independently of each other with the same growth rate ; and their superposition causes sw - like oscillations with the large critical frequency as in fig .  [",
    "fig : transient ] a. hence , `` almost '' mirror symmetric experimental setups that do not favor a particular tw propagation direction cause an initial growth phase with sw characteristics @xcite .",
    "but then a competition between the two tw constituents sets in when the advective nonlinearities have become sufficiently strong .",
    "they amplify the mirror - symmetry breaking differences between @xmath99 and @xmath100 and cause the decay of the minority tw .",
    "thus , the sw , which still has a large frequency , is transformed into a fast tw ( fig .  [",
    "fig : transient ] b -h ) .",
    "this sw @xmath3 tw transformation being advection driven is spatiotemporally complicated , in particular for the concentration field and it implies a dramatic redistribution of concentration by advective `` rolling in '' of concentration ( fig .  [",
    "fig : transient ] c -g ) .",
    "it takes place within less than one vertical thermal diffusion time and it starts roughly when the flow amplitudes of the two constituent tws have grown to about the phase velocity @xmath79 : first , concentration is advected up- and downwards in the form of plumes by the growing sw - like flow that reverts periodically its direction ; the vertical concentration gradient being still as large as that of the quiescent conductive state .",
    "the sw @xmath3 tw transformation is triggered by an advective wave breaking and wave toppling process of the crests and troughs of the concentration wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] c -d ) , whereas the waves of @xmath93 and @xmath20 do not undergo substantial structural changes .",
    "advective nonlinearities have by now become sufficiently strong to make the mirror - symmetry - breaking differences between the original , left and right propagating tw constituents of the sw clearly visible .",
    "when the concentration wave crests ( troughs ) with a high ( low ) alcohol content bend and topple , they are advectively `` rolled in '' .    the flow induced sequence of first deforming , then bending , and finally rolling in the plume - like wave crests and troughs is associated with and driven by a growth of the spatial phase shift between velocity and concentration field from zero to about @xmath101 during the sw @xmath3 tw transformation : in the sw the spatial location of the nodes of @xmath21 and @xmath93 coincide while their oscillations are shifted in time by about a quarter of an oscillation period .",
    "the value of this phase difference , @xmath102 , does not change during the whole transition sequence but in the tw , it also implies a spatial shift of @xmath21 and @xmath93 of @xmath101 .    in the early tw phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] h ) the lateral concentration difference between adjacent roll like regions is still almost as large as the initial vertical concentration contrast in the conductive state .",
    "thus , the frequency and the phase velocity of this emerging tw are still very large , i.e. , not much smaller than the critical values .",
    "but then for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] a long - term tw transient to a low - frequency , strongly nonlinear and strongly anharmonic relaxed tw state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transient ] i ) sets in : slow diffusion degrades and homogenizes the concentration striations , the spatial extension over which @xmath21 is constant at the two alternating high and low levels increases , the plateau height decreases , the width of boundary layers between these plateaus shrinks , the @xmath21-wave profile becomes more and more trapezoidal , and the alcohol surplus ( deficiency ) in the cold top ( warm bottom ) part of the fluid layer decreases , thereby reducing the overall vertical concentration difference between top and bottom .",
    "this longtime degradation of concentration gradients is reflected by a dramatic decrease of the mixing number @xmath54 and with it of the frequency @xmath59 relative to the initial values  the better the fluid becomes mixed the smaller is @xmath59 .",
    "tw and ltw convection has been studied experimentally and theoretically in detail @xcite . but little is known about nonlinear sw states beyond a weakly nonlinear analysis @xcite that is restricted to the immediate vicinity of the oscillatory threshold .",
    "it showed that sws are unstable there , typically bifurcating backwards .    in order to obtain the solution branch , we stabilize the sw states by suppressing phase propagation ( so tws can not compete against sws ) and , if necessary , by exerting a control procedure .",
    "the latter operates via the field amplitudes or the heat current injected into the fluid and the rayleigh number in response to the instantaneous frequency @xmath59 and its temporal derivative @xmath103 , respectively @xcite . in this way we trace out the sw solution branch all the way from close to onset with large frequency to slowly oscillating sws that eventually period - double into chaos .",
    "[ fig : swbifprops ] shows the bifurcation behavior of sws and how it changes with varying soret coupling strength .",
    "the solution branch for the soc is included for comparison only for @xmath104 . the heating range in which sws exist increases when @xmath31 becomes more negative since the oscillatory bifurcation threshold @xmath77 is shifted stronger to higher @xmath60 than the sw saddle - node positions at @xmath105 which marks the lower end of the @xmath60-interval containing sws .",
    "all these sws bifurcate subcritically out of the conductive state as unstable solutions .",
    "they become stable via saddle - node bifurcations when the phase - pinning condition is imposed .",
    "however , when this condition is lifted completely then sws decay by developing tw transients since any spatial phase difference between @xmath21 and @xmath93 causes the extrema of the latter to be `` pulled '' towards the solutally shifted buoyancy extrema .",
    "depending on @xmath60 these transients either end in a nonlinear tw or soc or the conductive state .    moving along an sw branch the maximal vertical upflow velocity @xmath58 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : swbifprops](a ) ] does not increase monotonically as in tws and socs but rather has a maximum somewhat below the respective soc value before it drops again . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : swbifprops](b ) ] and @xmath107 , respectively , at onset .",
    "this variation follows the universal scaling law @xmath75 , cf .",

    "[ fig : swpdoubling](a ) ] are stable down to their respective saddle - nodes when phase propagation is suppressed so that tw solutions do not exist .",
    "then , the sw solutions , too , change their stability at saddle - node bifurcation(s ) , one for @xmath31=-0.03 at @xmath108 and three for @xmath31=-0.25 [ two of them can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : swpdoubling](b ) at @xmath109 . with increasing @xmath60",

    "thereafter , for example , the downflow ( upflow ) extrema occurring in the sw oscillations , say , at @xmath36=0 ( @xmath110 are more intense than the upflow ( downflow ) extrema .",
    "this is reflected by the first splitting of the sw solution branches in fig .",
    "[ fig : swpdoubling ] .",
    "consequently , the time averaged fields have now a net soc - like structure with non zero mean downflow ( upflow ) , say , at @xmath36=0 ( @xmath111 .    in fig .",

    "beyond the last chaotic windows , we did not observe any stable sws : heating above this threshold leads to the development of transients into a stable , large - amplitude soc on the _ upper _ solution branch [ e.g. , with amplitude @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : swpdoubling](a ) , i.e. , well outside the plot range of fig .",
    "[ fig : swphasespace ] ] .",
    "thus , here the question arises whether  and if so  how and how long the heteroclinic orbits connecting the two unstable symmetry degenerate soc fixed points on the lower solution branch with small convection amplitudes ( @xmath116 in fig .",
    "[ fig : swphasespace ] ) organize and restrain the dynamics of the periodic and chaotic sws that switch between up- and downflow .",
    "ltws consist of wave trains of traveling convection rolls which are surrounded by quiescent fluid @xcite . there exist several attemps to model ltws by weakly nonlinear small - amplitude expansions around the convective onset @xcite and modifications thereof @xcite .",
    "but due to the strongly nonlinear characteristics of ltws these models are aimed at some qualitative aspects of ltw states .    here",
    "we investigate stable ltws at subcritical driving , @xmath96 , where the quiescent conductive surrounding is stable as well .",
    "the rolls grow out of this environment at the tail end of the wave train , travel through the convective bulk of the ltw with increasing phase velocity @xmath117 and wavelength @xmath118 , and decay at the head of the wave train ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ) .",
    "these stable ltw states are uniquely selected .",
    "their width @xmath119 ( or number of rolls ) is stationary and depends in an unique way on the control parameters ( cf .",
    "[ fig : biftw_ltw ] ) .",
    "the whole convective region drifts through the motionless state with a drift velocity @xmath120 that can be positive or negative but that is small compared to the phase velocity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the frequency of a ltw is constant in a frame of reference that is comoving with the ltw s drift .    to characterize the concentration variations in a ltw we use a local mixing number @xmath121 that is defined similarly to the case of extended states as the mean variance of @xmath21 .",
    "but here the lateral average is replaced by a time average at a fixed lateral position @xmath36 , @xmath122 so brackets denote here an average over @xmath37 and @xmath123 instead of @xmath37 and @xmath36 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdef ] ) .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ( c ) shows the variation of @xmath121 over the convective region of a typical long ltw .",
    "the relation between @xmath121 and the local phase velocity @xmath117 in the bulk of the ltw is the same as the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath74 for tws .",
    "the smallest stable localized pulses have for each @xmath31 a minimal width of about 5 rolls",
    ". with increasing @xmath60 ltws grow in width and amplitude and @xmath119 diverges at a maximal driving @xmath124 . beyond this value , ltws of stationary width",
    "seem to be no longer possible .",
    "thereafter , only transient localized convective regions can occur which keep expanding between two fronts .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : biftw_ltw ] the existence interval of ltws at fixed @xmath31 can be divided into two regimes : in the regime of short pulses the frequency decreases with increasing @xmath60 and the amplitude grows fast whereas in the regime of long ltws the frequency increases with @xmath60 and the amplitude grows only moderately .",
    "short ltws are dominated by a direct interaction between the growth part and the decay part of the convection rolls .",
    "long ltws are characterized by an extended bulk part where rolls travel with phase velocity @xmath117 that increases from tail to head .",
    "this corresponds to an increasing local wavelength @xmath125 since the frequency @xmath59 is constant in the frame that is comoving with @xmath120 .",
    "the speeding up of @xmath117 reflects the growing concentration contrast between adjacent rolls along the @xmath36-direction : the minimal mixing number is located in the growth region of the tail where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are minimal as well . on their way from tail to head the rolls do not reach a stationary balance between @xmath21 injection from the different boundary layers and advective mixing and diffusive homogenisation of concentration differences on a constant level of small @xmath54 . rather ltw rolls collapse at the head when @xmath79 has grown up to @xmath58 [ right arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ( b ) ] .",
    "thereafter concentration is discharged and sustains a barrier of @xmath126 ahead of the decay part which stabilizes the conductive state there against invasion of convection .",
    "[ fig : biftw_ltw ] ( b ) and ( c ) compare the maximal flow velocities and the frequencies of ltws for several @xmath31 with the respective tw branch of @xmath127 for which the saddle location @xmath128 is the lowest one .",
    "note that the ltw values for @xmath58 and @xmath59 always lie near the saddle values of tws .",
    "although there exist no extended tws below the shown tw saddle positions there exist stable ltws ahead of these global tw saddles when @xmath31 is sufficiently negative . for example",
    ", for @xmath129 almost all ltws of finite width appear _ below _ the existence region for tws as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : biftw_ltw ] .",
    "the intriguing existence of stable ltws without coexisting tws is ensured by a flow - induced lateral concentration redistribution over its convective bulk .",
    "positive `` blue '' ( negative `` red '' ) concentration deviation from the global mean is sucked from the top ( bottom ) boundary layer into right ( left ) turning rolls as soon as they become nonlinear during their growth [ left arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ( b ) ] .",
    "convection in the bulk of a ( long ) ltw shows all the characteristics of a strongly nonlinear extended tw .",
    "thus , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixdiff ] , positive ( negative ) concentration is transported within the closed streamline regions predominantly in the upper ( lower ) half away from the tail towards the head . this lateral concentration transport is reflected in the time averaged current of @xmath21 [ cf .",
    "its streamlines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltw](e ) ] .",
    "at the same time , mean concentration , @xmath130 , migrates mostly to the left along open velocity field streamlines that meander between the closed roll regions [ green regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : ltw](a ) ] . in this way a region with",
    "well mixed fluid , i.e. , almost vanishing @xmath21 is created and sustained under the tail . this strongly nonlinear large scale concentration redistribution that maintains the concentration locally at a homogeneous mean level under the trailing front makes there the growth of convection possible : by reducing the stabilizing concentration gradients the driving buoyancy force is locally increased there to levels which suffice to cause convection in a well - mixed fluid .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ( d ) shows that this effect causes the mean convectively generated @xmath131 profile to extend significantly further into the conductive region than the mean convective temperature field .",
    "thus , the buoyancy @xmath132 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : ltw ] ( d ) ] is determined in the front regions predominantly by the concentration field . this explains ( i ) the decrease of buoyancy below conduction levels ahead of the decay part with the associated restabilization of conduction there and ( ii ) the increase of @xmath132 out of the conductive state at the tail and its strong overshoot over the bulk enabling convection growth even for heating @xmath60 where no stable extended tws are possible .",
    "three oscillatory steady states of convection in binary fluid mixtures like ethanol - water were investigated and compared numerically in a cross section perpendicular to the roll axes : traveling waves , standing waves , and localized traveling waves .",
    "in addition the supercritical growth of sws out of perturbations and the sw @xmath3 tw transformation was elucidated .",
    "the full bifurcation behavior of tws and sws has been presented and their typical concentration field structures are shown in detail .",
    "both extended oscillatory periodic patterns bifurcate subcritically out of the conductive state in a common hopf bifurcation .",
    "the decrease of the phase velocity or the frequency along the solution branches is connected to the decrease of the mean @xmath21 contrasts in the system due to advective mixing .",
    "thereby , the different symmetries and flow topologies of tws and sws cause a different behavior in the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "however frequencies and mixing numbers are always related to each other via the universal scale relation @xmath75 .",
    "tws are mirror - glide symmetric under @xmath133 . at high amplitudes",
    "they are characterized by the occurrence of closed streamlines in the frame comoving with the tw s phase velocity .",
    "the regions of closed streamlines are displaced alternately towards the upper and lower plates with their respective concentration boundary layers .",
    "the latter feed selectively concentration only into the nearby closed streamline domains where it is homogenized .",
    "this leads to the characteristic concentration distribution with homogeneous rolls of alternating signs in @xmath21 .",
    "they are separated by meandering inner boundary layers of @xmath134 which are spatially correlated with open streamlines of the velocity field . with increasing amplitude",
    "the concentration contrasts between the rolls decrease , the phase velocity slows down , and the tw ends at large amplitudes in a mirror symmetric soc state .",
    "sws are always laterally mirror symmetric .",
    "the solution branch turns around at a saddle node and becomes stable there under phase pinning conditions . for strongly negative @xmath31 the stable part of the sw branch",
    "is directed towards lower amplitudes  in contrast to the tw case  and develops further saddle nodes .",
    "the complicated bifurcation behavior at low frequencies seems to be due to an interaction with the unstable low amplitude soc solutions .",
    "there is a breaking of the mirror - timeshift symmetry which is a prerequisite for the following period doubling cascade into chaos . without phase pinning the sws",
    "develop tw transients which end either in a nonlinear tw or a soc state depending on the parameters .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the symmetry breaking of a weakly nonlinear sw during its transient growth at supercritical heating towards a nonlinear tw .",
    "the transition is characterized by a dramatic advective reorganization of the @xmath21 field and therefore of the buoyancy field within a short time interval .",
    "the only global symmetry operation for a ltw is the mirror - timeshift [ @xmath135 in the frame which is comoving with its small drift velocity @xmath120 .",
    "the structual properties of a generic long ltw were presented as well as the global bifurcation behavior with @xmath60 for different @xmath31 . for strongly negative separation ratios",
    "ltws exist monostably at low heatings @xmath60 where no extended tws are possible .",
    "this is ensured by a flow - induced lateral large scale redistribution of concentration over its tw dominated convective bulk : thereby , concentration is maintained under the tail of the wave train at a homogeneous mean level .",
