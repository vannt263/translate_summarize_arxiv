    "in our study , we have investigated the effects of rotation on the thermal afterglows result from transient energy releases inside the star .",
    "three possible forms of energy release , namely , the ` shell ' , ` ring ' and ` spot ' cases , are considered . `",
    "shell ' case is a hypothetical case that energy is released at a particular density in the form of a spherical shell . in ` ring '",
    "case , energy is released at a particular density around the rotational equator .",
    "this could be resulted from superfluid - driven glitch ( anderson 1975 ) . in ` spot ' case ,",
    "energy is released at a localized region .",
    "this could be resulted from crust - cracking ( ruderman 1969 ) .",
    "the general expression for the line element of an axial symmetric spacetime is determined by time - translational invariance and axial - rotational invariance : @xmath0\\ ] ] we calculate all the necessary metric functions as well as the stellar structure by using hartle s formalism ( hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",
    "+ the energy momentum tensor inside a star consist of perfect fluid which allow heat flow is : @xmath1 with the rotating metric , the vanishing covariant divergence of the energy momentum tensor gives us the heat transport equation .",
    "@xmath2 the equation is checked by recovering to the non - rotational case ( cheng , li , & suen 1998 ) and the newtonian case with spherically symmetric metric and flat spacetime respectively .",
    "the equation of state of neutron matter ( pandharipande 1971 ) is adopted .",
    "we also adopt the heat capacities , thermal conductivity and neutrino emissivities from previous studies ( maxwell 1979 ; flowers & itoh 1981 ) .",
    "+ we simulate the propagation of heat pulses by markovian random walk .",
    "models with different rotational frequency are compared .",
