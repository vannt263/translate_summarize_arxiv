    "traditionally , thermodynamics is a theory that describes systems exchanging energy and entropy with idealized heat reservoirs and work sources .",
    "it provides two fundamental laws every system must obey : the first law ( energy balance ) and the second law ( entropy increase ) .",
    "reconciling these macroscopic laws with a microscopic picture of atoms and molecules in motion raises subtle issues . as far back as the nineteenth century , maxwell speculated that an external agent , using microscopic information to control the state of a system , might be able to circumvent the second law @xcite . this agent is now known as ` maxwell s demon ' . accepting the possibility of ` intelligent interventions ' ( due to idealized measurement and information processing devices such as computers ) , it is widely accepted that the correct application of landauer s principle @xcite will save the second law , as noted by bennett @xcite in his analysis of szilard s famous engine @xcite .",
    "note however that maxwell s demon can also be ` exorcized ' without reference to intelligent interventions , by showing that any device designed to exploit molecular scale fluctuations to violate the second law , must fail or must produce a large dissipation somewhere else as analysed for specific models by smulochowski @xcite and feynman @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for opposing arguments and refs .",
    "@xcite for other illustrative models .",
    "besides the possibility of actively measuring and controlling the system , bennett noted that a tape of bits in a low entropy state might act as a thermodynamic resource while the tape randomizes itself @xcite , which can be regarded as another form of a maxwell demon in which the low entropy state of the tape allows for the rectification of thermal fluctuations , for instance to lift a mass or cool a cold reservoir .",
    "a particular mathematical model was proposed and analyzed by mandal and jarzynski @xcite and has been followed by further models exploring the possibility of maxwell s demon devices incorporating an information reservoir in the thermodynamic description @xcite .    however , the models proposed above are rather abstract and it would be desirable to find a _ physical _ model able to reproduce the same results . by ` physical ' model",
    "we mean that we start with a well - defined and well - motivated hamiltonian describing an explicit , physically realizable system , and , following standard procedures ( e.g. as used to derive master equations ) , we end up with a mathematical description equivalent to those above . in this paper",
    "we will indeed show that a quantum dot spin valve with perfectly polarized leads allowing only for one sort of spins to tunnel through , which interacts with a tape of electrons causing spin flips , provides a physical implementation of the device proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that it has identical dynamics and thermodynamics ( though a quite different physical interpretation ) .",
    "a similar model was already put forward by datta in ref .",
    "@xcite where the ` impurities ' in his model correspond to the electrons on the tape in our model .",
    "for another physical realization also see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the models discussed above all rely on measurements or interactions with a bit at predetermined discrete times or intervals .",
    "the resulting dynamics can in general not be formulated as a differential equation anymore .",
    "an alternative approach to feedback control relies on a continuous measurement scheme and the fact that a master equation ( me ) can be unraveled in terms of trajectories representing the actual state of the system .",
    "this approach yields an effective differential equation for the system dynamics and has been extensively used in the field of open quantum systems and quantum information @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was successfully applied to construct maxwell demon like feedbacks and to study the thermodynamics of such systems @xcite .",
    "it was shown that such feedback schemes can also be formulated within an inclusive approach not relying on any phenomenological measurements or feedback actions @xcite .",
    "in addition to the me picture , the thermodynamic implications of continuous feedback schemes were studied for langevin dynamics as well @xcite .    aside from the quest to design illustrative devices , which are able to rectify thermal fluctuations by some sort of information processing , the question naturally arises as to whether it is possible to treat the different approaches above in a unified framework @xcite . to address this question with our model  following the three cases investigated by barato and seifert @xcite",
    " we will design a measurement - based feedback scheme , which has identical system dynamics as the tape model , and we will derive an effective me for poisson distributed bits on the tape or measurement times respectively .",
    "we will compare the different forms of the second laws and we will show that the second law for discrete feedback control can provide a smaller , equal or larger bound on the amount of extractable work as compared to the second law involving the tape of bits . for the effective me",
    "we will show that its associated entropy production represents the same physical statement as the second law involving the tape of bits .",

    "the system we want to control  either by a tape of bits or by feedback control ( see sec . [ sec measurement based feedback scheme ] )  consists of a quantum dot in the ultra strong coulomb blockade regime attached to two spin - polarized ferromagnetic leads , which preferably allow one spin direction to tunnel .",
    "such quantum dot spin valves can be experimentally realized by molecular quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the quantum dot is either empty or filled by an electron with spin up or spin down , thus the system hilbert space is three dimensional , @xmath0 , and the hamiltonian of the system is assumed to be @xmath1 . for perfectly and oppositely polarized",

    "assuming equal lead temperatures , @xmath20 , the fermi functions fulfill the local detailed balance condition @xmath21 and the steady state @xmath22 of the system is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the electric current through the system vanishes : due to the opposite polarization of the leads the transport through the spin valve is blocked .",
    "we note however that this is an idealized description . in practice",
    "the leads are not perfectly polarized and phonons in the surrounding medium can induce spin flips in the quantum dot . for simplicity we will neglect these effects because they do not change the general point of our discussion as long as they are relatively weak . for the rest of this paper we will set @xmath25 .",
    "we now describe the tape of bits , which moves frictionlessly past the quantum dot spin valve with constant speed .",
    "in contrast to the models of refs .",
    "@xcite we assume that each bit interacts with the system only for a short time @xmath26 and that the time @xmath27 between two successive bits is relatively long , @xmath28 . during this time @xmath27 the system evolves according to the liouvillian @xmath4 .    physically , each bit on the tape represents another quantum dot containing one excess electron , which is either in state spin up or spin down . to quantify the portion of spin up and spin down electrons we introduce the excess parameter @xmath29 , which is defined by @xmath30 here , @xmath31 denotes the probability that an _ incoming _ bit is in state @xmath32 .",

    "we will model the interaction between a filled quantum dot and the @xmath36th bit by an effective heisenberg hamiltonian of the form @xmath37 .",
    "here @xmath38 is the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath39 is a coupling strength whose time dependence is induced by proximity between the system and bit . if the interaction occurs around the time @xmath40 , we demand that @xmath41 i.e. , @xmath42 is approximately zero for @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "our assumption @xmath44 allows us to neglect any dissipative dynamics arising from the interaction with the leads .",
    "the time evolution of the combined system and bit  given that the spin valve quantum dot is initially filled with an electron  is governed by the unitary operator @xmath45 \\sim u_{\\text{swap}}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath46 is the unitary swap operator acting on two spins as @xmath47 .",
    "thus , if the spins of the system and the bit are the same then nothing happens , but if they are opposite then they both flip .",
    "if the quantum dot of the spin valve is initially empty , @xmath48 , we assume that the state of the bit does not change during the interval @xmath49 .",
    "the exact form of the time dependent coupling strength @xmath42 is unimportant : as long as @xmath26 , it only needs to fulfill eq .",
    "( [ eq coupling j ] ) . in practice , of course , @xmath42 will never exactly fulfill eq .",
    "( [ eq coupling j ] ) but will differ by a small amount @xmath50 such that the true unitary operation we implement is given by @xmath51 where the correction term @xmath52 gives rise to quantum coherences between the spin up and down states and a finite probability proportional to @xmath53 that the swap operation does not succeed .",
    "because our treatment is in any case idealized ( for instance , due to the assumed perfect polarization of the leads and the absence of phonons ) we will also assume that @xmath54 , but a more sophisticated treatment would include a discussion about the so called _ fidelity _ of our _ quantum gate _",
    "( i.e. , our swap operation )",
    ".    the effective heisenberg hamiltonian above can be physically more rigorously justified by considering a hubbard hamiltonian for the two quantum dots ( spin valve plus bit ) , introducing a weak electron tunneling term between the dots and for which one can show that the effective low energy interaction is governed by the heisenberg hamiltonian above @xcite . the fact that this allows the realization of a swap gate",
    "is also used for purposes of quantum information processing in quantum dots @xcite . in these setups the time dependent coupling @xmath42 is induced by an electrostatic barrier , which can be controlled by a gate voltage , between two spatially fixed neighbouring quantum dots .",
    "thus , we do not necessarily need a tape of bits moving past the spin valve but we could also use a single electron transistor or any other single electron source adjacent to the spin valve and control the interaction by a gate voltage .",
    "however , for similarity with the models proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite we will stick to the picture of a tape of quantum dots pulled along the spin valve .",
    "finally , note that a swap operation between two spin qubits in quantum dots was experimentally realized already in 2005 @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to formulate the dynamical evolution of the system over one cycle of duration @xmath27 .",
    "for conciseness we henceforth neglect the small time window @xmath35 and simply assume that the swap operation happens instantaneously .",
    "we start a cycle with the system bit interaction , eventually leading to a swap operation , and end a cycle shortly before the next bit comes to interact with the system .",
    "once we have reached a periodic steady state we can drop the index @xmath36 specifying the bit of the tape because the statistical behaviour of the system is the same from one interaction interval to the next . for the interval",
    "during which there is no system bit interaction , the time evolution of the system is generated by the liouvillian ( [ eq liouvillian spin valve ] ) , i.e. , @xmath55 where the superscript @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) denotes the state of the system before ( after ) the swap operation .",

    "furthermore , we will henceforth measure @xmath27 in units of @xmath65 , i.e. , we can set without loss of generality @xmath66 .",
    "although our model is taken from the field of electron transport , we will now show that it can indeed be mapped to a brownian ratchet .",
    "this makes it easier to relate our model to other work in the field of information thermodynamics and maxwell s demon where many models are based on classical brownian dynamics , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes a very similar device and ref .",
    "@xcite for an experimental realization .    to see why",
    "this can be done , let us imagine that we have a particle hopping between three discrete states labeled @xmath67 with corresponding energies @xmath68 . if this particle is immersed in a heat bath , its thermally activated transitions @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( note that the direct transition @xmath71 is forbidden ) obey local detailed balance exactly as in eq .",
    "( [ eq local detailed balance ] ) .",
    "this picture is also supported by the fact that the stationary state of the spin valve , eq .",
    "( [ eq steady state spin valve ] ) , equals a canonical equilibrium state with respect to the energies defined above .",
    "the analogy to a brownian ratchet demon , in which a particle is transported against an external force ( or _ load _ ) by switching between two different potentials , is completed by recognizing that our fictitious particle could live on a discrete lattice @xmath72 with impenetrable walls between the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 , but is allowed to change between two different modes due to the interaction with a bit ( or later due to the feedback , sec .

    "second , our system possesses a symmetry : mapping the parameters @xmath83 to @xmath84 is physically equivalent to exchanging the labels @xmath85 and @xmath86 and @xmath74 and @xmath73 of the spin valve .",

    "we now briefly summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we divide the discussion into three main parts , which can be related to secs .",
    "[ sec physical implementation of the model ] and [ sec thermodynamics ] ( i ) , sec .",
    "[ sec measurement based feedback scheme ] ( ii ) and sec .",
    "[ sec effective master equation ] ( iii ) .",
    "\\(i ) we have constructed a solvable physical model able to rectify thermal fluctuations to transport electrons against a bias ( i.e. , to charge a battery ) by writing information on a tape without energy expenditure .",
    "this ` information - electric device ' is thermodynamically equivalent to the model in ref .",
    "the physical treatment of the problem allows us to clearly state the assumptions needed to obtain this ideal equivalence .",
    "first , to have an unchanged first law of thermodynamics , we need to assume a frictionless gliding tape of bits and degenerate spin eigenstates in the spin valve and on the tape .",
    "second , to keep the discussion at a moderate level , we have neglected various experimentally important imperfections , which would reduce the overall efficiency of our device .",
    "namely , we have assumed perfectly opposite polarized leads , neglected phonon interactions and assumed a fully unitary and error - free swap gate .",
    "although we used the physical picture of a spin valve interacting via a heisenberg hamiltonian with the bits , it is worth pointing out that this could be also realized with other models : aside from the brownian ratchet analogue , one could , for instance , use double quantum dots where the left and right eigenstates form a pseudospin giving rise to the same system dynamics , and  as pointed out at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec system bit interaction ]  one does not necessarily need to implement a tape of bits although this picture might still be helpful for thermodynamic considerations .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note the similarity of these information driven devices with the theory of the micromaser @xcite in which a stream of excited two - level atoms ( like a tape of bits ) is injected into a high quality cavity building up a photon field .",
    "indeed , the device proposed by scully in ref .",
    "@xcite can be regarded as a quantum optical version of an information driven engine , where the entropy of the motional degrees of freedom of the two - level atoms is increased while energy is continuously extracted from the population of the excited states .",
    "\\(ii ) we have formulated a discrete measurement and feedback model with identical system dynamics but a conceptually different second law of thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , there are multiple second laws due to the fact that a dynamically irrelevant parameter ( @xmath182 ) entered the mutual information",
    ". this additional parameter might be more rigorously exploited to give a stronger bound on the extractable work by minimizing the mutual information with respect to @xmath182 , although its precise value @xmath235 might not be physically intuitive [ eq . ( [ eq max min delta0 ] ) ] .",
    "furthermore , although we used identical ` information resources ' ( namely a two - state memory equivalent to a bit on the tape ) , the second law for discrete feedback can provide a smaller , equal or larger bound than the second law involving the tape of bits , hence it remains a challenge to treat the different forms of information processing in one unified framework .",
    "\\(iii ) we have derived an effective me governing the system evolution for poisson distributed events where an ` event ' can refer either to an interaction with a bit or a measurement and feedback step .",
    "the me is the same for both approaches and we believe that its effective entropy production coincides with the entropy production of the tape model .",
    "_ a priori _ this is not obvious , because we have seen that the mutual information can coincide with the change in shannon entropy of the bits [ see sec .",
    "[ sec measurement based feedback scheme ] or point ( ii ) ] .",
    "however , we have shown that the _ a posteriori _ postulated information current equals the rate of entropy change of an idealized tape of bits , see eq .",
    "( [ eq equivalence effective and tape ] ) , thus giving the phenomenologically introduced information current a precise physical and information theoretic basis .",
    "furthermore , in the limit of infinite fast feedback we have demonstrated that the effective entropy production coincides with the entropy production of the tape model whereas the rate of mutual information diverges .",
    "it is worth mentioning two more things : first of all , the information current ( [ eq equivalence effective and tape ] ) has the standard form often encountered in thermodynamics of a current times an affinity .",
    "thus , the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite  that the entropy production involving the shannon entropy difference of the information reservoir has an _ extra _ term different from the usual current times affinity  is in general not true .",
    "second , we want to mention that under certain assumptions it is indeed possible to define a rate of mutual information as was done , for instance , in ref .",
    "note , however , that this has not the standard form of a current times an affinity and is always positive and thus , makes it again impossible to address question of information erasure or related issues .",
