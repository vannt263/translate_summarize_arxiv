    "many physical phenomena are associated with the propagation of dispersive waves . while in some cases",
    "their dynamics is linear , many relevant situations manifest a non - negligible nonlinearity which produces complex patterns .",
    "when the number of degrees of freedom is large enough , such problems must be treated in a statistical manner .",
    "the weak - wave turbulence ( wwt ) theory is a very general framework by which the statistical properties of a large number of incoherent and interacting waves can be studied .",
    "the theory , developed during the late sixties @xcite , is based on a systematic analytical approach that culminates in the so called _ wave kinetic equation _ that describes the evolution of the wave spectrum in time ( homogeneity and weak nonlinearity are assumed ) .",
    "the wave kinetic equation is thus the analogue of the boltzmann equation for classical particles and , in principle , should be able to give reliable predictions for the statistical distribution of energy as a function of wave numbers , as well as for various statistical observables .    the wwt theory has been applied to a variety of fields such as for example ocean waves @xcite , capillary waves @xcite alfvn waves @xcite or optical waves @xcite .",
    "wwt constitutes hence an interdisciplinary tool suitable for investigating the statistical mechanics of a large number of interacting waves .",
    "a remarkable aspect of such a theory is that , in the presence of an external forcing and dissipation , exact solutions of the kinetic equation describing constant fluxes of its quadratic conserved quantities can be obtained analytically ; this important result was achieved for the first time by v. zakharov in 1966@xcite . despite the beauty of these theoretical results",
    "it is of paramount importance to verify if the assumptions behind the theory are realized in practice and thus if this approach is suitable to address physical issues of complex wave systems .",
    "almost 20 years ago a family of one - dimensional nonlinear dispersive wave equations , namely the mmt model @xcite , was introduced as a , in principle simple , model for assessing the validity of wwt theory ; however , the results reported in @xcite were somehow discouraging and it was reported that `` the predictions of weak turbulence theory fail and yield a much flatter spectrum compared with the steeper spectrum observed in the numerical statistical steady state '' .",
    "deviations from the wwt predictions have been then observed numerically in @xcite and have been associated to the presence of coherent structures such as quasi - solitons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mmt model has become a `` paradigm - like '' for the verification of the wwt predictions .",
    "indeed , this model offers the rare opportunity to analyse turbulent dynamics over a large range of scales , and it has been proven to display much of the features relevant for turbulent flows @xcite , even though it is a one - dimensional idealised model .",
    "it is instructive to remind that the process of energy cascade observed in systems of interacting random waves is similar to the one in fluid turbulence .",
    "indeed , fully - developed fluid turbulence is known to exhibit a direct energy cascade with a power - law energy spectrum very close to @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the spacial wave - number .",
    "such a slope is consistent with the phenomenological kolmogorov theory which assumes scale invariance .",
    "it turns out that such assumption is not supported by experimental data and numerical simulations ; indeed , the three - dimensional fluid turbulence cascade is characterized by an _",
    "anomalous scaling _ associated to the _ intermittent _ properties of the transfer and dissipation of the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "intermittency has been widely studied in fluid turbulence ; however , while exact results have been found for passive scalar dynamics in random flows @xcite , no analytical prediction ( based on the navier - stokes equations ) for the scaling of the structure functions is at the moment available .",
    "the theory of weak - wave turbulence can be considered as a mean - field approach , where the relevant observable is the wave action spectrum @xmath4 , which becomes deterministic in the thermodynamic limit and thus ignores fluctuations . from this perspective",
    ", one would be tempted to rule out the presence of anomalous scaling and intermittency . nonetheless , as anticipated , many numerical and experimental observations have pointed out the existence of such non trivial statistics . notably in wave turbulence",
    ", the phenomenon of intermittency has been observed in different experiments of mechanically forced surface gravity waves by different groups , @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the origin of such intermittency remains mysterious : in @xcite such phenomenon has been associated with numerous nonpropagating spikes or splashes and propagating breakers . in experiments reported in @xcite wave breaking or",
    "whitecaps did not occur but cusps ( that can leave a signature on the spectrum ) were observed on the fluid surface . in @xcite it has been observed that the degree of intermittency depends on the forcing parameter and is somehow independent from breaking and capillary bursts on steep gravity waves .",
    "more in general , in a number of papers @xcite a tentative explanation of the origin of intermittency in wave turbulence has been put forward ; however , no quantitative predictions are so far available .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the mmt model in the defocusing regime with gravity - wave dispersion as a basic tool for studying the properties of wave turbulence . while simple , the model has been shown to be dynamically particularly rich , and to display high sensitivity to external forces and parameters @xcite .",
    "for this reason , here we stick to the same configuration examined in the first investigation @xcite , to disentangle the various effects .",
    "in particular , we show that in the direct energy cascade regime the wwt theory offers an accurate prediction for wave spectral slope , provided the ratio between the nonlinear to the linear hamiltonian is sufficiently small .",
    "when the ratio of nonlinear to linear energy is large enough , the prediction of the wave turbulence fails and , as shown in @xcite , the spectrum becomes steeper than the wwt prediction .",
    "the calculation of the structure functions and of the probability density function ( pdf ) of increments of the wave field at different scales show that , while in the strongly nonlinear regime the dynamics is characterised by intermittency , in the weakly nonlinear case described by the wwt spectrum the wave field exhibits a quasi - self - similar scaling .",
    "the model can not describe the phenomenon of wave breaking or the formations of cusps ; therefore , it offers a unique tool to establish that the observed intermittency can not be attributed solely to such singular or quasi - singular structures .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : we first describe the mmt model with forcing and dissipation and introduce the control parameters of the simulations .",
    "the numerical set - up is then presented and the results on the spectral slopes are shown .",
    "we then consider the structure function and the pdf of the wave field at different scales and discuss the intermittency properties of the defocusing mmt model . in the last section , a discussion of the results and the final conclusions",
    "are reported .",
    "we consider the following model @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a dispersive operator of the form @xmath8 ; the dispersion relation is chosen as @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 are two terms that have been included in order to mimic forcing and dissipation ; their specific form will be given in the next section .",
    "the model in ( [ eq : mmt ] ) belongs to the mmt family of equations , which generalizes the nonlinear schredinger equation ; our selection is based on the fact that , despite it has been shown in @xcite that for such member of the family the flux for the direct cascade predicted by the wwt has the correct sign and the cascade is local , numerical simulations have shown an unexpected distribution of energy in the spectral modes @xcite .    in absence of forcing and dissipation",
    "the equation ( [ eq : mmt ] ) preserves the number of particles @xmath12 , and the hamiltonian @xmath13 , which can be written as : @xmath14 the hamiltonian is written as the sum of two terms that account for a linear contribution , @xmath15 , ( first term in _ r.h.s . _ ) and a nonlinear one , @xmath16 . the crucial assumption of wwt is that @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio thus constitutes the small parameter which allows the perturbative approach at the basis of the development of the wwt theory .",
    "it is important to underline that in front of the nonlinear term the coefficient is taken as positive : this implies that the model is _",
    "defocusing_. the case with opposite sign ( focusing ) is modulationally unstable and its dynamics is dominated by bright solitary waves and coherent structures @xcite . here ,",
    "we devote our attention only to the defocusing case , as it has been found to be more pathological with respect to wtt predictions .    by imposing a forcing confined at large scales ( small @xmath3 ) and a dissipation only at small scales ( large @xmath3 ) , a _",
    "direct _ cascade in @xmath3__-space _ _ , characterised by a constant flux of linear energy , @xmath15 is predicted by the wwt once a stationary state is reached .",
    "the spectrum is expected to exhibit the following power law : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the brackets @xmath20 imply ensemble average .",
    "the verification of such predictions has failed so far @xcite . in particular a spectrum of the following type @xmath21",
    "has been revealed in numerical simulations as a new final statistical steady state , consistently with a different closure proposed on heuristic grounds .",
    "hereafter , this spectrum will be referred to as the mmt spectrum . in the following section we will test the validity of the above predictions .",
    "in order to observe the direct cascade , we have performed numerical simulations with the following deterministic instability - type forcing written in fourier space : @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "dissipation is imposed at very large and small scales using the following terms @xmath24 with @xmath25 .      from equation ( [ eq : mmt ] )",
    "it is possible to establish four different time scales associated with dispersion , nonlinearity , high and low wave number dissipation : @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are a characteristic wave number and amplitude , respectively .",
    "we can then define the following `` dimensionless '' parameters as the ratio between the dispersive / dissipative and nonlinear time scales : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the analogue of the reynolds number in fluid mechanics . in terms of these parameters ,",
    "( [ eq : mmt ] ) takes the following form : @xmath31 where all the variables and the operators @xmath7 , @xmath32 and @xmath11 are now `` dimensionless '' . given a computational domain , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the forcing amplitude represent our control parameters of the simulations . in order to extricate the different physical effects",
    ", we shall keep constant the forcing and the reynolds numbers and change only @xmath33 .",
    "the latter parameter indeed controls the ratio between nonlinear to linear waves , and therefore represents the key parameter in the wwt theory .",
    "we will also monitor the degree of nonlinearity of the asymptotic steady state of our simulation by considering the ratio of nonlinear to linear hamiltonian for the equation ( [ eq : mmtnd ] ) : @xmath35 note that the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath0 calculated when a stationary state has reached is not obvious ; in the next section , we will find out that the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath33 is quasi - linear .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mmtnd ] ) has been solved through a strang splitting pseudo - spectral method . in the unforced and undamped case ,",
    "the method guarantees a conservation of the number of particles and hamiltonian with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "simulations have been performed in a periodic box of size @xmath36 with a number of modes set at @xmath37 .",
    "the time - marching is carried out with @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath23 are selected and the simulation is run until the total number of particles , the linear and the nonlinear hamiltonian reach a stationary state .",
    "the simulations are performed in the following way : at time @xmath39 the wave - field is initialised with @xmath40 .        among many of the simulations performed , here , for the sake of clarity , we report two of them , i.e. _ run1 _ and _ run2 _ , characterized by different nonlinearity ; the parameters of the simulations are reported in table [ table1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the evolution of the number of particles for two numerical simulations is plotted .",
