    "the first galaxies , by definition , are expected to contain very young stellar populations of very low metallicity . however , the possibility of detecting unambiguous observable signatures of such primordial stellar populations with current or indeed planned future instrumentation is currently a matter of considerable debate .",
    "for example , one long - sought distinctive spectral signature of the first generation of galaxies is relatively strong heii emission at @xmath15   ( e.g. shapley et al .",
    "2003 , nagao et al .",
    "2008 , di serego alighieri et al .",
    "however , near - infrared spectroscopy of the sensitivity required to detect this line at @xmath16 will certainly not be available until the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) , and even then some theoretical predictions indicate that it is unlikely to be found in detectable objects ( salvaterra , ferrara & dayal 2011 , but see also pawlik , milosavljevic & bromm 2011 ) .    by necessity , therefore , recent attention has focussed on whether the broad - band near - infrared photometry which has now been successfully used to discover galaxies at @xmath17 ( e.g. mclure et al .",
    "2010 ; oesch et al . 2010 ; bouwens et al . 2010a ; bunker et al . 2010 ; finkelstein et al . 2010 ; vanzella et al .",
    "2011 ) can actually be used to establish the rest - frame continuum slopes of the highest redshift galaxies .",
    "specifically , very young , metal - poor stellar populations are arguably expected to result in substantially bluer continuum slopes around @xmath18  than have been detected to date in galaxies discovered at any lower redshift @xmath19 ( e.g. steidel et al . 1999 ; meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; adelberger & steidel 2000 ; ouchi et al . 2004 ; stanway et al .",
    "2005 ; bouwens et al . 2006 ; hathi et al . 2008 ;",
    "bouwens et al . 2009 ; erb et al . 2010 ) .",
    "it has become the normal convention to parameterise the ultra - violet continuum slopes of galaxies in terms of a power - law index , @xmath3 , where @xmath20 ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; thus , @xmath21 corresponds to a source which has a flat spectrum in terms of @xmath22 , and hence has zero colour in the ab magnitude system ) . as discussed by several authors , while the bluest galaxies observed at @xmath23 have @xmath12 , values as low ( i.e. blue ) as @xmath24 can in principle be produced by a young , low - metallicity stellar population ( e.g. bouwens et al .",
    "2010b ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "however , for this idealized prediction to actually be realized in practice , several conditions have to be satisfied simultaneously , namely i ) the stellar population has to be very young ( e.g. @xmath25myr for @xmath26 , or @xmath27myr for @xmath28 ) , ii ) the starlight must obviously be completely free from any significant dust extinction , and iii ) the starlight must also _ not _ be significantly contaminated by ( redder ) nebular continuum ( a condition which has important implications for uv photon escape fraction , and hence reionization  see , for example , robertson et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "for this reason , the recent report by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) ( supported to some extent by finkelstein et al .",
    "2010 ) that the faintest galaxies detected at @xmath0 do indeed display an average value of @xmath29 is both exciting and arguably surprising enough to merit further detailed and independent investigation .",
    "this is especially the case because some authors are already beginning to assume that the existence of such extreme blue slopes is a robust result , already ripe for detailed theoretical interpretation ( e.g. taniguchi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to carefully assess whether the current _ hst _ wfc3 data do indeed provide clear evidence for such extremely blue slopes in faint galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "there are a number of potentially subtle biases which can affect the determination of uv continuum slopes from the wfc3/ir data , especially when , as is inevitably the case for the faintest objects , the results have to be based on the _ average _ colours of galaxies whose individual @xmath3 values have associated errors which can be as large as @xmath30 . to check for , and attempt to quantify , the extent of any such biases we undertake two different approaches in this paper .",
    "first , we take advantage of the dynamic range offered by the available public wfc3/ir imaging to explore how derived values of @xmath3 ( and average values @xmath10 ) depend on galaxy candidate robustness and signal : noise ratio as we approach the flux limit of a given survey .",
    "second , we undertake and analyse a set of fairly simple ( but complete end - to - end ) simulations to explore what apparent values of ( and trends in ) @xmath10 would be deduced from the existing wfc3/ir data for different assumed input values of @xmath31 combined with realistic estimates of the faint - end slope of the @xmath13 galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we briefly review how we have selected three new , high - redshift galaxy samples from the wfc3/ir+acs+irac imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) , the hudf parallel field 2 ( hudf09 - 2 ) , and the early release science imaging ( ers ) of the northern portion of goods - south .",
    "the reduction of the _ hst _ data , the deconfusion of the _ spitzer _ irac data , and the extraction , analysis , classification and redshift estimation of the galaxies uncovered from this imaging are described in detail in mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , as this underpins the extraction of a new robust galaxy sample at @xmath32 which is the focus of the mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) study . in this study",
    "we retain not only the robust @xmath33 sources detailed in mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , but all galaxies from the larger parent sample with acceptable redshift solutions at @xmath34 , which are classified as either robust or unclear .",
    "this allows us to explore trends in @xmath3 over a reasonably wide range in redshift ( @xmath35 ) and uv luminosity ( @xmath36 ) , and also to explore potential biases introduced by the exclusion or inclusion of galaxies with less robust photometric redshifts . in section 3",
    "we explain how we determined the rest - frame uv continuum slope , @xmath3 , for the galaxies extracted from the different imaging datasets at different redshifts .",
    "then , in section 4 we present and analyse our results , and demonstrate what level of data quality is actually _ required _ to achieve internally consistent results between the different galaxy samples uncovered from surveys of varying depths .",
    "we move on to describe and analyse our simulations in section 5 before discussing the implications of our findings in section 6 .",
    "a summary of our conclusions is then presented in section 7 .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) and any cosmological calculations assume @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the candidate galaxies were all selected from our own reductions of the pubicly available near - infrared wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf , ers and hudf09 - 2 fields , as described in mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( we note that the hudf wfc3/ir imaging is the same year-1 , 2009 , imaging as utilised in mclure et al .",
    "2010 ) . in brief , candidate selection in all three fields was undertaken by first selecting sources with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) down to a deep signal : noise limit in each of the wfc3/ir @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 images , and then forming the superset of near - infrared selected sources by merging these catalogues .",
    "then , as again detailed in mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , photometric redshifts ( with associated probability distributions ) were derived for all potential sources based on 0.6-arcsec diameter flux - density measurements made on the available _ hst _ acs optical imaging , the wfc3/ir imaging , and the _ spitzer _ irac imaging ( after deconfusion of the irac images based on the wfc3/ir @xmath42 or @xmath41 data ) .",
    "the samples were then culled to retain only sources with an acceptable solution at redshift @xmath34 ( i.e. redshift solutions with a formally acceptable value of @xmath43 , typically @xmath44 given the number of data points and model free parameters ) .",
    "all candidate objects were then visually inspected , and rejected from the catalogue if they lay too near to the perimeter of the imaging , or too close to bright sources ( a cull that is reflected in the effective survey areas quoted by mclure et al .",
    "any remaining suspected pseudo sources arising from image artefacts were also removed at this stage .    finally , all of the acs+wfc3/ir+irac spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits were inspected , and the sources classified as either robust or unclear depending on whether the alternative low - redshift solution could be excluded at @xmath45-@xmath6 on the basis of @xmath46 .",
    "we note here that the ratio of robust : unclear sources varies substantially between the fields , being @xmath472:1 in the hudf , @xmath47 1:1 in the ers , and @xmath471:2 in hudf09 - 2 .",
    "this is primarily due to the variation in the depths of the available optical acs imaging , relative to the new wfc3/ir near - infrared imaging , as discussed further below .",
    "absolute rest - frame uv magnitudes , @xmath48 , have been calculated for all objects by integrating the spectral energy distribution of the best - fitting evolutionary synthesis model ( see mclure et al .",
    "2011 ) through a synthetic `` narrow - band '' filter of rest - frame width 100 and correcting to total magnitude ( from the 0.6-arcsec aperture magnitudes on which the sed fitting was based ) via subtraction of a global aperture correction of 0.25mag .      in the hudf the high - redshift galaxy sample reported by mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) has now been superceded by the galaxy sample extracted by mclure et al .",
    "the new parent sample utilised here includes _ spitzer _",
    "irac detections / limits in the selection process , and extends to lower redshift to include all objects with an acceptable primary redshift solution at @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting hudf sample contains a total of 147 candidate galaxies with @xmath49 . within this master sample ,",
    "95 sources are considered robust according to the criterion that the alternative lower - redshift solution can be rejected with better than 2-@xmath6 confidence ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "the relatively high fraction of robust high - redshift sources in this field reflects in large part the extreme depth of the asociated optical acs imaging in the hudf , which helps to establish the robustness of any potential lyman breaks .",
    "as shown in figs 1 and 2 , the final hudf galaxy sample at @xmath34 extends to @xmath50 , and samples a rest - frame uv luminosity range corresponding to @xmath51 ( ab ) .",
    "however , with one exception , robust sources are confined to @xmath52 ( ab ) .",
    "the wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf09 - 2 ( hudf parallel 2 ) field utilised here is only 0.07mag shallower than the 2009 hudf wfc3/ir imaging in the @xmath41 band , and covers a similar area .",
    "the extracted parent sample is thus comparable in size , but due to the shallower depth of available optical acs imaging , the fraction of robust : unclear sources is much lower ( see mclure et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the hudf09 - 2 sample used here contains 135 candidate galaxies with @xmath49 . within this master sample ,",
    "49 sources are considered robust according to the criterion that the alternative lower - redshift solution can be rejected with better than 2-@xmath6 confidence ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "as shown in figs 1 and 2 , the final hudf09 - 2 galaxy sample at @xmath34 again extends to @xmath50 , and samples a rest - frame uv luminosity range corresponding to @xmath51 ( ab ) . however , in this case , robust sources are basically confined to @xmath53 ( ab ) .",
    "the ers wfc3/ir imaging of the northern portion of goods - south covers an area @xmath54 times larger than each of the above - mentioned ultra - deep fields , but is typically a magnitude shallower .",
    "in addition , the @xmath55 filter was utilised in the ers observations , rather than @xmath56 , making the @xmath57-band imaging even shallower . because our galaxy selection does not involve specific colour cuts",
    ", this does not complicate our redshift completeness ( c.f .",
    "oesch et al .",
    "2010 , bouwens et al .",
    "2010a ) but this , in combination with optical data limited to goods depth , does mean that about half of the ers sample is classified as unclear .",
    "the ers sample used here contains 337 candidate galaxies with @xmath49 , within this master sample , 160 sources are considered robust according to the criterion that the alternative lower - redshift solution can be rejected with better than 2-@xmath6 confidence ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .    as shown in figs 1 and 2 , the final ers galaxy sample at @xmath34 extends to @xmath50 , and samples a brighter rest - frame uv luminosity range corresponding to @xmath58 ( ab ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the standard convention is to characterise the rest - frame uv continuum slope via a power - law index , @xmath3 , where @xmath20 .    given the effective wavelengths of the wfc3/ir filters of interest here ( @xmath55:@xmath59=@xmath60 ; @xmath56:@xmath59=@xmath61 ; @xmath41:@xmath59=@xmath62 ; @xmath42:@xmath59=@xmath63 ) the relevant conversions from ab mag colours to @xmath3 are :    @xmath64    @xmath65    @xmath66    choosing between the latter two options is dictated by which @xmath57-band filter was used in the observations , but otherwise the choice is determined by the estimated redshift of the source .",
    "specifically , at @xmath67 , both the lyman - break and any potential lyman-@xmath68 emission can enter the @xmath57-band ( which cuts in at 9000 ) , thus contaminating any measure of @xmath3 .",
    "given the uncertainties in @xmath69 we therefore use equation ( 1 ) for any source with @xmath67 , and equations ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) as appropriate at lower redshift ( to ensure we sample comparable rest - frame wavelengths at all redshifts ) .",
    "we also note that , at @xmath70 , both the lyman - break and any potential lyman-@xmath68 emission can enter the @xmath41-band ( which cuts in at 11000 ) , and hence , at least for the current photometric dataset , any values of @xmath3 derived for sources at @xmath71 should not be taken seriously ( this is why neither bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) nor finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) attempted measurement of @xmath3 at @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , in reality , after application of the galaxy sample quality control described below , only one galaxy candidate at @xmath71 survives ( in the hudf09 - 2 field ) for inclusion in the calculation of average values of @xmath3 . finally , we note that equation ( 1 ) above differs very slightly from the relation adopted by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , which is @xmath72 , but the differences in derived values of @xmath3 are completely insignificant in the current context ( e.g. for @xmath73 , the bouwens et al .",
    "relation yields @xmath74 , while equation ( 1 ) yields @xmath75 ) .",
    "in figs 1 and 2 we plot the raw values of @xmath3 for each source in the hudf , hudf09 - 2 and ers samples versus redshift , @xmath76 , and uv absolute magnitude , @xmath48 . in each plot",
    "the sources classified as robust are indicated by the filled symbols , and those classified as unclear are indicated by the open symbols . as well as illustrating the range of redshift and uv luminosity probed by each galaxy sample , these plots dramatically illustrate what an extreme range of apparent individual values of @xmath3 results from the photometric uncertainty in colour , especially in the fainter luminosity bins probed by each sample .",
    "in general it can be seen that a large fraction of the faintest galaxies are classified as unclear .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that galaxies detected with relatively low signal : noise ratio in wfc3/ir , even if completely undetected at shorter wavelengths , do not display sufficiently strong breaks in their seds to rule out an alternative low - redshift solution ( i.e. a balmer break rather than a lyman break ) .",
    "however , it is also apparent that , even at brighter magnitudes , a large fraction of the reddest galaxies , with @xmath77 , are classified as unclear .",
    "this simply reflects a lack of compelling evidence that the continuum above the putative lyman break is blue enough to rule out a lower - redshift ( possibly dusty ) solution .",
    "we return to this point later in the paper , when discussing the results of the simulations in sections 5 and 6 .    the other point to note from fig .",
    "2 is that all three samples contain robust sources with apparent values of @xmath3 as extreme as @xmath78 .",
    "we have not plotted error bars on individual @xmath3 values in fig . 2 , but as discussed and plotted in mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , these individual values are of course highly uncertain , with @xmath30 or even larger .",
    "the fact that photometric uncertainty must play a major role in producing these extreme values of @xmath3 is revealed in fig .",
    "2 by the fact that the plume of extremely blue / low @xmath3 values emerges at a different absolute magnitude in the different samples .    to illustrate this",
    "more clearly we plot all three samples of robust sources together in fig .",
    "it can be seen that very blue sources with apparent values of @xmath79 emerge in the ers sample at @xmath80 , whereas in the deeper hudf data the emergence of such apparently extreme sources is delayed until @xmath81 .",
    "the impact on the scatter in @xmath3 of approaching the flux - density limit is perhaps illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "4 where we confine attention to @xmath33 , and plot @xmath3 versus observed @xmath41 .    of course , while photometric scatter inevitably causes the apparent range of @xmath3 to rapidly increase as the sample flux limit is approached , there are also a large number of galaxies in the final luminosity bin probed by each sample , so moderately accurate measures of the average value of @xmath82 can in principle still be derived .",
    "therefore the key issue , which we now explore , is how the average value of @xmath82 is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of robust / unclear sources , and also the signal : noise ratio limit of the galaxy catalogue .      in fig .",
    "5 we have divided the three - field sample into 3 redshift bins , and binned the data into luminosity bins 1 magnitude wide .",
    "we therefore plot the average value of @xmath3 , ( @xmath10 ) and in each plot show the sample - to - sample variation and the final overall average and standard error .",
    "the top row of plots shows the results as computed from all the individual data points shown in figs . 1 and 2 , including both robust and unclear sources .",
    "the second row shows the effect of including only the robust sources .",
    "finally , the third row shows the effect of further limiting the robust samples to contain only objects which have at least one 8-@xmath6 near - infrared detection in the wfc3/ir data .",
    "this set of plots reveals some interesting trends in the data which can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , it can be seen that restricting the sample to robust sources only has the general effect of moving @xmath10 to lower ( i.e. bluer ) values at virtually all redshifts and luminosities .",
    "some of this effect may be due to the ( desirable ) removal of lower - redshift interlopers from the high - redshift galaxy samples .",
    "however , some of this shift could also be due to a bias introduced by the fact that a blue uv continuum slope increases the chance that a source will be classified as robust , especially in the absence of a high signal : noise ratio break .",
    "this move to the blue is most dramatic in the faintest magnitude bin ; taken at face value the middle row of plots in fig .",
    "5 suggests that galaxies with @xmath83 have a typical uv continuum slope which evolves rapidly with redshift , with @xmath84 at @xmath85 , @xmath86 at @xmath87 , and @xmath88 at @xmath13 .",
    "this is clearly fairly similar to the trend reported by bouwens et al .",
    ".    however , it is also very clear that , especially in the faintest luminosity bins , there are huge sample - to - sample variations with , for example , the ers sample delivering very blue values of @xmath10 in the @xmath89 bin at @xmath13 compared to either of the deeper hudf and hudf09 - 2 samples .",
    "this is basically the effect of the plume to low values of @xmath3 seen at the ers flux limit as shown in fig .",
    "4 . to reconcile the results from the different samples in the luminosity bins in which they overlap",
    ", we found it necessary to insist on a minimum signal : noise ratio requirement . to avoid introducing any further colour bias we simply chose to insist that every object retained in the final , refined sample was detected in at least one wfc3/ir near - infrared passband at a minimum level of 8-@xmath6",
    "the impact of this further level of quality control is then shown in the bottom row of plots in fig .",
    "5 . no longer do the different samples deliver substantially different average values of @xmath10 , and it can be seen that the very low values of @xmath10 were indeed largely resulting from the lowest signal : noise ratio sources .",
    "importantly , with this level of further quality control , we are left with only one hudf object in the @xmath83 bin at @xmath13 , and hence can not plot a meaningful average value of @xmath10 . at @xmath90 ,",
    "where we can still probe this luminosity bin , the evidence for @xmath10 being significantly bluer than @xmath91 has disappeared .",
    "this final result is summarized in fig .",
    "6 , where we overplot the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath92 as a function of redshift .",
    "the derived datapoints shown in fig .",
    "6 are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "clearly , these results are consistent with @xmath93 over the full redshift and luminosity range which can be probed with these data .",
    "at the bright end they are also in good agreement with the results derived by both bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , so any disagreement is really confined to @xmath94 .    of course , it might be argued that by insisting on rejecting the lowest signal : noise ratio sources , we have effectively `` thrown away '' the `` evidence '' for how @xmath3 behaves at the faintest luminosities at the highest redshifts . however , for all the data consistency arguments outlined above , we have good reason to suspect that when @xmath10 in a given luminosity bin depends purely on low signal : noise ratio detections , its average value may be seriously biased . to explore",
    "whether this suspicion is fully justified , and to quantify the likely magnitude of any such effect , we now describe the creation and analysis of a set of simple simulations .",
    "to explore and attempt to explain the origin of any apparent bias towards excessively blue values of @xmath3 as derived from sources extracted with only @xmath95-@xmath6 photometry , we undertook a set of relatively simple simulations .",
    "specifically , we decided to insert into the ers and hudf _ hst _",
    "( acs+wfc3 ) and _ spitzer _ irac images a population of galaxies at @xmath13 , with a chosen fixed intrinsic value of @xmath3 , and then reclaimed these sources using exactly the same methodology as used to extract and refine the real high - redshift galaxy sample ( i.e. , including initial use of sextractor , full acs - wfc3-irac photometry from the real images , derivation of @xmath43 versus @xmath96 , high - redshift sample refinement requiring a statistically acceptable solution at @xmath97 , and final branding as robust or unclear depending on whether @xmath46 between the low - redshift and high - redshift solutions ) .",
    "we created three simulations , one in which all galaxies were assigned template seds with @xmath21 , one with all galaxies having @xmath98 , and an extreme simulation with @xmath99 .",
    "perhaps the key feature of our simulations is that we inserted a galaxy population which extended substantially below the nominal flux limits of the images , following the form of the mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) @xmath13 luminosity function down to @xmath100(ab ) .",
    "this is vital to properly simulate the effect of `` flux - boosting '' of some subset of the numerous faint sources into the final galaxy sample .",
    "the point here is that , while completely erroneous 5-@xmath6 sources are extremely unlikely , the random flux boosting of , for example , 3-@xmath6 sources to @xmath101-@xmath6 in _ either _ @xmath41 or @xmath42 can be relatively common when extracting a flux - limited sample down to the @xmath102-@xmath6 limit in the presence of steep number counts .",
    "moreover , such flux boosting is highly likely to be accompanied by a significant distortion in derived colour , in excess of that `` expected '' from adding the formal photometry errors in quadrature ( because it is extremely unlikely that a source would fall on , for example , a 2-@xmath6 positive noise peak in both the @xmath41 _ and _ @xmath42 images ) .",
    ".derived average @xmath3 values and standard errors as a function of absolute uv magnitude and redshift , as calculated using the robust sample of sources with the additional requirement of at least one 8-@xmath6 near - infrared detection .",
    "the final column simply gives the average value of @xmath3 , further averaged over the redshift range @xmath103 , including values from each redshift bin where this is available .",
    "the data given here are plotted in fig .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we created many realizations for both the ers and hudf fields .",
    "a typical outcome is shown in fig .",
    "7 , for both the @xmath21 and @xmath98 input catalogues .",
    "as in the earlier figures , ers `` sources '' are indicated in red , hudf `` sources '' in blue , and robust and unclear high - redshift galaxies are indicated by solid and open symbols respectively .",
    "while comparison with the earlier figures is complicated by the fact that figs 1 - 3 include galaxies over the redshift range @xmath104 , and inevitably contain some genuine low - redshift interlopers ( at least among the open symbols ) , it can be seen that fig .",
    "7 reproduces the key features displayed by the real data in , for example , fig .",
    "3 . specifically , even for input @xmath21 , both the ers and hudf simulated samples yield galaxies with apparent values of @xmath3 as blue as @xmath105 in the faintest luminosity / magnitude bin probed by each sample . in addition , several of these apparently ultra - blue sources are classified as robust .    by contrast , while artificially red sources up to @xmath106 are produced by the photometric uncertainties , ultra - red sources are much less prevalent , and red robust sources are very rare ( only one robust source in this simulation is retrieved with @xmath77 ) .",
    "the effect of these distributions of retrieved @xmath3 values on the average deduced value of @xmath10 as a function of uv luminosity is shown in fig .",
    "8 , again for both the @xmath21 and @xmath98 input scenarios .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "8 is remarkably similar to the @xmath13 points plotted in fig . 1 of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , and to those given in fig . 6 of finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . here",
    "the analysis of our @xmath21 simulation has resulted in an entirely artificial , apparently monotonic luminosity dependence of @xmath10 , with @xmath10 approaching @xmath107 in the faintest luminosity bin . only in the brightest bin",
    "has the true input value of @xmath3 been successfully retrieved .",
    "it is important to stress that the fact we recover @xmath108 at @xmath109 does not contradict the value of @xmath110 we measured from the @xmath111 data in this bin , as given in fig .",
    "6 and table 1 .",
    "as already discussed , to try to minimize bias , these measurements were limited to objects with at least one @xmath112-@xmath6 detection in the near - infrared , and even the @xmath109 luminosity bin contains some less significant detections which can bias the result to the blue unless filtered out .",
    "thus , our simulation simply implies that , with the depth of wfc3/ir data analysed here , unless such quality control is applied , a true @xmath12 will result in an accurately measured @xmath93 at @xmath113 , a somewhat biased measurement of @xmath114 at @xmath109 , and a severely biased measurement of @xmath88 at @xmath115 .",
    "thus , our simulation suggests that the apparent luminosity dependence of @xmath3 with @xmath11 reported by both bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ( from the same depth of data ) is at least _ not inconsistent _ with a true value of @xmath12 , independent of luminosity .    the lower panel in fig .",
    "8 simply shows how even bluer values , with apparent @xmath116 , inevitably result when the input value of @xmath3 is @xmath117 .",
    "however , this is clearly inconsistent with the data , as the input value of @xmath98 is of course correctly recovered from the simulation in the brightest luminosity bin , and this is inconsistent with the observed value of @xmath21 at @xmath118 .",
    "interestingly , the retrieved value of @xmath10 in the faintest luminosity bin is not the full 0.5 lower in the lower panel of fig .",
    "8 as compared to the upper panel .",
    "this implies that one can not easily correct for the bias in a unique way , and that a measured value of @xmath88 in this luminosity bin could be consistent with a true @xmath21 or @xmath98 within the errors .",
    "this simply reinforces the need to improve the depth of the wfc3/ir data to enable higher signal : noise measurements of @xmath3 in this crucial faint luminosity bin at @xmath13 .      to explore the origin of the `` @xmath3 '' bias so clearly displayed by the analysis of our simulations , we take advantage of the fact that the `` true '' input uv luminosity of every simulated galaxy is known , and explore how derived @xmath3 relates to the level of `` flux - boosting '' experienced by the simulated sources .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "9 , where the extracted @xmath3 value for all of the reclaimed ers and hudf high - redshift @xmath21 simulated galaxies is plotted against uv luminosity ( @xmath119-band ) flux boost , in magnitudes ( here , a positive value of `` boost '' means the reclaimed @xmath41 magnitude is _ brighter _ than the input value by the plotted magnitude difference ) .",
    "both the ers and hudf simulated galaxies behave in the same way and show that the extremely blue values of @xmath3 almost all result from sources which have entered the sample because their `` true '' @xmath41 magnitudes have been boosted by a few tenths of a magnitude ( up to @xmath5 magnitudes ) .",
    "this is not really surprising - at the faintest limit a substantial fraction of the supposedly @xmath120-@xmath6 sources in the @xmath41 image are significantly flux boosted , and random noise dictates that these same sources are unlikely to be as extremely flux - boosted at @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) indicates that a @xmath41 flux boost of 0.5 mag , will lead @xmath21 to be distorted to @xmath121 , explaining naturally the behaviour displayed in fig .",
    "however , what is less clear is why comparable flux - boosting in @xmath42 has not produced a comparable population of artificially red objects extending to @xmath122 . unless the sample is specifically @xmath123-band selected there is no obvious reason why @xmath41 flux boosting should be more prevalent than @xmath42 flux boosting .",
    "the answer to this is rather subtle .",
    "@xmath124-band flux boosting does occur , and it can be seen that some sources do indeed have their @xmath3 values over - estimated , up to values approaching @xmath125 .",
    "however , when large / red values of @xmath3 are produced by the noise and flux boosting , a significant fraction of the sources start to be classified as low - redshift sources by our code , and hence do not appear in fig . 9 ( which only contains objects with acceptable reclaimed solutions at @xmath97 ) . even among those `` red '' sources that do survive , with apparent @xmath126",
    ", it can be seen that few are classified as robust , simply because the measured redder @xmath127 colour permits an acceptable low - redshift solution .    in summary ,",
    "as the scatter inevitably rises in the final luminosity bin , and is exacerbated by the effects of flux - boosting of fainter sources into the ( apparently ) flux - limited sample , the process of high - redshift galaxy selection can clip the red wing of the scattered values , and bias the _ average _ @xmath10 value to the blue .",
    "this effect is not really specific to our particular method of source selection - a source scattered by @xmath42 flux boosting to @xmath122 will have an apparent colour @xmath128 , and is therefore less likely to be regarded as a secure high - redshift source as selected by standard lyman - break colour selection techniques .",
    "by contrast , any artificially `` blue '' galaxy resulting from @xmath41 flux boosting will almost always be retained , and indeed is liable to be classified as robust .",
    "we can of course check the extent to which this has happened in our simulated galaxy samples . indeed , for the hudf simulation shown in figs 79",
    ", we find that from an input sample of 82 @xmath111 galaxies , 12 were scattered out of the sample to low redshift due , in most cases , to their redder @xmath127 colours .    finally , for completeness",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "10 the effect of restricting our analysis of the @xmath111 , @xmath21 simulation to sources with at least one @xmath112-@xmath6 detection with wfc3/ir , in effect replicating our final analysis of the real data as presented in fig .",
    "6 . as with the real data",
    ", applying this level of quality control leaves us unable to say anything about @xmath3 at @xmath129 , but interestingly ( and reassuringly ) it also reduces the level of bias in the @xmath109 luminosity bin to @xmath130 . clearly the results presented in fig .",
    "6 are completely consistent with @xmath21 .",
    "our key results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first we find that , at @xmath131 and @xmath90 , the average value of uv slope is perfectly consistent with @xmath21 and displays no significant luminosity dependence over the uv luminosity range @xmath132 .",
    "second , we find that the same result appears to hold at @xmath13 , over the more restricted luminosity range @xmath133 , but conclude that no robust statement can yet be made about @xmath10 at fainter luminosities at @xmath0 .",
    "third , we show , both via data consistency arguments from fields of varying depth , and from simple ( yet realistic , and end - to - end ) simulations that attempting to extend the measurement of average uv slope into the faintest available luminosity bin ( as determined by @xmath134-@xmath6 detections ) yields values of @xmath10 which are biased to the blue , and can yield apparent average values as low as @xmath135 , even for a true input value of @xmath21 for every source .",
    "thus , while we can not rule out the recent claims that the faintest galaxies yet discovered at @xmath13 have extremely blue slopes , @xmath88 , we do show that such extreme values of @xmath10 are _ not _ found ( from the current data ) in any luminosity or redshift bin where good - quality photometry is available ( where `` good '' here means at least one detection in a wfc3/ir band at a significance level better than 8-@xmath6 ) .",
    "we note here that finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , while reporting raw results on @xmath10 at @xmath13 ( their fig .",
    "6 ) very similar to those reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , derive larger errors on @xmath10 , and conclude that there is as yet no evidence for a dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath11 at @xmath13 .",
    "this , then , provides a very strong and clear motivation for still deeper wfc3/ir imaging in the hudf , given the importance of testing the astrophysically important possibility that the very faintest high - redshift galaxies do display uv slopes significantly bluer that @xmath136 , with all the associated implications for metallicity , age and ionizing photon escape fraction ( bouwens et al . 2010b ; robertson et al .",
    "2010 ) . a depth improvement of @xmath5 mag .",
    "would be sufficient to convert most of the current @xmath101-@xmath6 detections to @xmath137-@xmath6 detections , thus enabling proper exploration of @xmath10 down to @xmath138 at @xmath13 .    because of its novelty , and potentially crucial implications for reionization , we have focussed most of the above discussion , and indeed our simulations , on the measurement of @xmath3 at @xmath13 . however , it is also of interest to assess how our results at @xmath87 and @xmath85 measure up to previous studies of @xmath3 at these and also lower redshifts .",
    "the most obvious point of comparison is the major study of uv continuum slope over the redshift range @xmath139 carried out by bouwens et al .",
    "this work presented extremely good evidence for a luminosity dependence of @xmath3 at @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we wish to stress that our failure to find any such luminosity dependence in @xmath3 at higher redshifts should not be taken as casting doubt on these results at lower redshift .",
    "in particular , the evidence presented by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for a steady decrease in @xmath10 over the luminosity range @xmath142 appears compelling , based as it is on very large samples of lyman - break galaxies in which @xmath3 can be determined purely from the _ optical _ photometry ( i.e. from _ hst _ acs @xmath143 colour ) .",
    "however , this luminosity dependence takes the average value of uv slope from @xmath144 at @xmath145 to @xmath146 at @xmath147 , and is attributed by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as being primarily a result of decreasing dust obscuration with decreasing uv luminosity ( see also stark et al .",
    "crucially , even at the faintest luminosities probed at @xmath141 , the bluest value of @xmath10 reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is @xmath148 .",
    "it is by no means obvious that a decrease in dust content with increasing redshift should maintain the slope of the @xmath149 relation , simply shifting it to more negative values of @xmath3 . as already discussed here and elsewhere , it is relatively straightforward for ` normal ' , essentially dust - free stellar populations to produce @xmath21 , but the production of significantly bluer slopes requires different astrophysics in the form of very young , very low metallicity stellar populations , with low levels of nebular emission .",
    "the results presented by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on @xmath3 at @xmath150 and @xmath151 are inevitably much more uncertain than those at lower redshift , in part because they involved the use of nicmos data in the measurement of @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , at the brighter end of the luminosity range probed , at @xmath152 , our more robust measurements support the conclusion of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that lyman break galaxies are bluer at @xmath153 than at @xmath141 , with @xmath10 having moved from @xmath154 at @xmath141 to @xmath155 ( see our fig . 6 and",
    "the values given in table 4 of bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there is thus no serious doubt that the brighter lyman break galaxies have become significantly bluer with increasing redshift , and the idea that this change is primarily due to decreasing dust content gains support from the very low ( generally negligible ) values of @xmath156 inferred from the best - fitting sed models at @xmath0 deduced by mclure et al .",
    "therefore the key question now is whether the @xmath149 relation essentially plateaus at @xmath12 at @xmath157 due to the near absence of dust at all luminosities , or whether there is indeed evidence for a continuing dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath11 , albeit perhaps with a different slope . our own results , as shown in fig .",
    "6 , support the former scenario , but as already discussed , our analysis also emphasizes the vital importance of deeper wfc3/ir data to establish the true values of the typical uv slopes of the very faintest galaxies at @xmath13 .",
    "we have undertaken a critical study of the evidence for extremely blue uv continuum slopes in the highest redshift galaxies , focussing on the robust determination of the uv power - law index @xmath3 ( where @xmath158 ) .",
    "our analysis is based on three new wfc3/ir - selected samples of galaxies spanning nearly two decades in uv luminosity over the redshift range @xmath4 ( mclure et al .",
    "we have explored the impact of inclusion / exclusion of less robust high - redshift candidates , and have used the varying depths of the samples to explore the effects of noise and selection bias at a given uv luminosity .",
    "simple data - consistency arguments indicate that artificially blue average values of @xmath3 can result when the analysis is extended into the deepest @xmath5-magnitude bin of these wfc3/ir - selected galaxy samples , regardless of the actual luminosity or redshift range probed . by confining attention to robust high - redshift galaxy candidates , with at least one 8-@xmath6 detection in the wfc3/ir imaging",
    ", we find that the average value of @xmath3 is consistent with @xmath7 over the redshift range @xmath8 , and the uv absolute magnitude range @xmath9 , and that @xmath10 shows no significant trend with either redshift or @xmath11 .    we have created and analysed a set of simple end - to - end simulations based on the wfc3/ir+acs hudf and ers datasets which demonstrate that a bias towards artifically low / blue average values of @xmath3 is indeed `` expected '' when the uv slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold , and conclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for uv slopes significantly bluer than @xmath12 , the typical value displayed by the bluest star - forming galaxies at more modest redshifts ( e.g. ngc1705 ; @xmath159 ) .",
    "a robust measurement of @xmath10 for the faintest galaxies at @xmath13 ( and indeed @xmath14 ) remains a key observational goal , as it provides a fundamental test for high escape fractions from a potentially abundant source of reionizing photons .",
    "this goal is achievable with _ hst _ , but requires still deeper wfc3/ir imaging in the hudf .",
    "we note , however , that , due to degeneracies between escape fraction and metallicity , it may prove hard to establish robust evidence for a high escape fraction from the measurement of @xmath3 _ unless _ extreme values of @xmath24 are indeed confirmed for faint galaxies at @xmath16 ( in which case both low metallicity _ and _ a high escape fraction are required ) .",
