    "river basin geomorphology is a very old subject of study initiated by horton @xcite .",
    "hack @xcite , studying the drainage system in the shenandoah valley and the adjacent mountains of virginia , observed a power law relation @xmath4 between the length @xmath1 of a stream from its source to a divide and the area of the basin @xmath2 that collects the precipitation contributing to the stream as tributaries .",
    "hack also corroborated this power law through the data gathered by langbein @xcite of nearly @xmath5 different streams in the northeastern united states .",
    "this empirical relation  ( [ hacklaw ] ) is widely accepted nowadays albeit with a different exponent ( see gray @xcite , muller @xcite ) and is called hack s law .",
    "mandelbrot @xcite mentions hack s law to strengthen his contention that `` _",
    "_ if all rivers as well as their basins are mutually similar _ _ , _ the fractal length - area argument predicts _ ( _ river__s length_)@xmath6 _ is proportional to _ ( _ basin__s area_)@xmath7 '' where @xmath8 is the fractal dimension of the river . in this connection , it is worth remarking that the hurst exponent in fractional brownian motion and in time series analysis arose from the study of the nile basin by hurst @xcite where he proposed the relation @xmath9 as that governing the width , @xmath10 , and the length , @xmath11 , of the smallest rectangular region containing the drainage system .",
    "various statistical models of drainage networks have been proposed ( see rodriguez - iturbe and rinaldo @xcite for a detailed survey ) . in this paper",

    "@xcite : `` _ _ from the results _ _ , _ we suggest that a statistical framework referring to the scaling invariance of the entire basin structure should be used in the interpretation of hack__s law_.
