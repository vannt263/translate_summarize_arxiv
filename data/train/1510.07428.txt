    "gilbert random graph_.    random geometric graphs form an interesting and rich subject from a purely theoretical perspective , but they are also studied in relation to a variety of applications .",
    "they have , for instance , been used to model wireless networks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the growth of tumors @xcite , protein  protein interactions @xcite , fiber - based materials @xcite and many more phenomena .",
    "random geometric graphs have been the subject of considerable research effort over the past decades , and quite precise results are now known for this model on aspects such as connectivity , hamilton cycles , the clique number , the chromatic number and random walks on the graph .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "a comprehensive overview of the results prior to 2003 can be found in the monograph @xcite .    by the results in chapter  10 of @xcite ( which build on the work of several previous authors , including gilbert @xcite ) , there is a constant @xmath10 such that if @xmath11 with @xmath12 then the largest component contains a sublinear proportion of all vertices , while if @xmath13 then the largest component contains a linear fraction of all vertices .",
    "phrased differently , a `` giant '' component suddenly emerges when the average degree exceeds a certain constant ( @xmath14 to be precise ) .",
    "an interesting detail is that the precise value of @xmath15 remains unknown to this date .",
    "we consider a _ power of choices version _ of the random geometric graph . by this , we mean the following probabilistic process : there are @xmath0 _ rounds _ in total , and in each round a player is offered _ two _ random points from the unit square , of which he has to select exactly one for inclusion in the evolving geometric graph .",
    "the objective of the player is to keep the size of the largest component as small as possible .",
    "( in section  [ sec : concl ] , we briefly discuss the setup when the player wants to maximize the size of the largest component . ) in particular , we are interested in the question for which functions @xmath2 the player can avoid the formation of a _ linear - sized _ ( `` giant '' ) component with high probability",

    "the interpretations of @xmath21 w.h.p .",

    "all components are smaller than @xmath27 .",

    "we will come back to this at the end of the paper .",
    "note that theorem  [ thm : online ] implies in particular that for any @xmath41 , w.h.p .",
    "the largest component is sublinear in size , and that for any @xmath42 , w.h.p .",
    "the largest component will be of size @xmath6 no matter how the player plays .",
    "thus , theorem  [ thm : online ] establishes a `` threshold '' of @xmath43 for the appearance of a giant component in the geometric power of choices process .",
    "note that this threshold is higher than the threshold for the original geometric random graph by a power of @xmath0 .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the power of choices version of the well - known erds ",

    "observe also that the threshold behaviour is very different from that of the original random geometric graph setting : theorem  [ thm : online ] states that qualitatively the behaviour of the process is the same for all @xmath44 . in the standard geometric graph on the other hand , the size of the largest component jumps from @xmath45 just below the threshold @xmath46 to @xmath47 just above @xmath48 .",
    "( in the well - known erds",
    " rnyi graph , a similar phenomenon occurs ; see , e.g. , @xcite . ) in the process considered in theorem  [ thm : online ] , however , the order of the largest component under optimal play is @xmath47 for every @xmath44 .",
    "so , in particular , there is no @xmath49 analogous to @xmath50 .",

    "_ in the process we discussed so far , the player does not know which points will arrive in future rounds .",
    "it is interesting to consider what would happen if the player were _ clairvoyant _ , that is , if he already knew from the start of the game where all the points in all the rounds will fall .",
    "put differently , he is given @xmath0 pairs of random points all at once , and needs to select one point from each of these pairs .",
    "this is often called the _ offline _ version of the game , and the original version is called the _ online _ version .",
    "intuitively , the additional advantage of being clairvoyant should allow the player to delay the onset of a giant component even further .",
    "the next theorem shows that this is indeed true , but that the advantage is rather modest  the threshold only increases by a factor of @xmath52 .    [ thm : offline ] consider the geometric offline power of choices setting defined above .",

    "again the result extends to the setting with @xmath39 choices ; the expression for @xmath1 then is @xmath53{c / n}$ ] .",
    "the notion of the `` power of choices '' essentially dates back to a 1994 paper by azar , broder , karlin and upfal @xcite . in informal computer science terms",
    ", their result states that if one allocates a large number of jobs to a large number of servers by assigning each job to the currently less busy of _ two _ randomly chosen servers , one observes a dramatic improvement in load balancing over a completely random assignment .",
    "this result marked the beginning of the development of the power of choices as a powerful new paradigm in computer science , with applications to load balancing , hashing , distributed computing , network routing and other areas ( see @xcite for a comprehensive survey ) .    the mathematical model for this setting is usually given in terms of balls and bins . in the standard balls and bins experiment ,",
    "there are @xmath0 balls and @xmath0 bins , and each ball is dropped into a random bin ( chosen uniformly at random , independently of the choices for the other balls ) . denoting by @xmath54 the number of balls in the fullest bin , also called the _",
    "maximum load _ , it is well known ( and can be proved by the first and second moment methods ) that w.h.p .",
    "@xmath55 ( an even more precise result is given in @xcite ) .    in the power of choices version of this setup ,",
    "the @xmath0 balls arrive sequentially , and for each ball _ two _ random bins are sampled ( uniformly at random and independently from each other ) .",
    "the goal now is to devise a strategy for choosing between the bins that keeps the maximum load as small as possible .",
    "an obvious choice of a strategy is the _ greedy _ strategy where we always choose the least full bin ( in case of a tie we can choose arbitrarily ) .",
    "azar et al .",
    "@xcite showed the following remarkable result .",
    "recall that a random variable @xmath56 _ stochastically dominates _ the random variable @xmath57 if @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "[ thm : azaretal ] consider the power of choices balls and bins process with @xmath0 bins and @xmath0 rounds , and let @xmath54 denote the maximum load after the process ends if we employ the greedy strategy .",
    "then @xmath60 moreover , the maximum load under any other strategy stochastically dominates the maximum load under the greedy strategy .",
    "this result shows that in the power of two choices ball and bins process , the maximum load under the greedy strategy is _ exponentially smaller _ than in the ordinary nonpower - of - choices version , and that moreover it is very strongly concentrated .",
    "it also shows that the greedy strategy is optimal in a very strong sense .",
    "we should remark that theorem  [ thm : azaretal ] is in a fact a slight simplification of theorem  1 of @xcite . among other things ,",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that allowing more than two choices per step further decreases the maximum load , but only by a constant factor .",
    "note that the behaviour of the geometric power of choices process is in contrast with this : as mentioned in the previous section , in our setting a choice of @xmath61 options in each round results in a threshold at @xmath62{1/(n \\cdot(\\log\\log n)^{d-1 } ) } ) $ ] .",
    "thus , every additional choice per step increases the threshold by a power of @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : azaretal ] plays an important role in our proof of theorem  [ thm : online ] , and may give some intuition why a power of @xmath63 appears in the threshold for our geometric power of choices process .",
    "_ the achlioptas process .",
    "_ the power of choices version of the classical erds  rnyi graph process is usually called the _ achlioptas process _",
    "after dimitris achlioptas , who first suggested it .",
    "the achlioptas process starts with an empty graph on @xmath0 vertices . in each round ,",
    "two random vertex pairs are presented , and the player needs to select exactly one of them for inclusion as an edge in the evolving graph .",
    "his goal is to delay or accelerate the occurrence of some monotone graph property , such as containing a giant component , containing a triangle , or containing a hamilton cycle .",
    "bohman and frieze @xcite were the first to study the achlioptas process .",
    "they showed that by an appropriate edge - selection strategy , the emergence of a giant component can be delayed by a constant factor .",
    "several authors subsequently improved on their bounds , and also showed that no improvement beyond a constant factor is possible @xcite .",
    "the opposite problem of creating a giant component as quickly as possible was studied in @xcite , and an exact threshold for the offline problem was determined in @xcite .",
    "all these results show that the power of choices offered by the achlioptas process affects the threshold for the appearance of a giant component only by a constant factor .",
    "more recently , the precise nature of the phase transition in the achlioptas process received much attention : countering `` strong numerical evidence '' presented in @xcite , riordan and warnke @xcite showed that for a large number of natural player strategies , the achlioptas phase transition is in fact continuous .",
    "other properties that have been studied for the achlioptas process include hamiltonicity @xcite and the appearance of copies of a given fixed graph @xmath64 .",
    "_ the vertex achlioptas process .",
    "_ the reader might wonder whether it is reasonable to compare our geometric power of choices process to the achlioptas process ",
    "after all , we are selecting vertices in the former and edges in the latter .",
    "let us therefore consider the following process : the @xmath0 vertices of an erds  rnyi random graph @xmath65 ( i.e. , the random graph sampled uniformly from all graphs on @xmath0 vertices and @xmath66 edges ) are revealed two at a time , along with all edges induced by the vertices revealed so far , and we need to select one of the two vertices for inclusion in a subgraph .",
    "our goal is to avoid a linear - sized component in the subgraph induced by the vertices we select .",
    "this process indeed seems to be a better reference for our comparison , but its phase transition has not been studied explicitly in the literature . as it turns out , also in this _",
    "`` vertex achlioptas process '' _ , w.h.p .",
    "a giant component can not be avoided as soon as the average degree of the underlying random graph exceeds a certain constant .",
    "we give a proof for this in appendix  [ sec : vertex - achlioptas ] .",
    "we remark that further discussion of our results and possible directions for further work can be found in section  [ sec : concl ] , at the end of the paper .      in the following , we informally outline some of the main ideas used in the proofs of theorems [ thm : online ] and [ thm : offline ] .",
    "our goal here is not to give detailed proof sketches , but to give some impression of our overall proof strategies and of the type of arguments used .",
    "we will describe our proof strategies in more detail later where appropriate .",
    "in all our proofs , we consider a discretized version of the random geometric graph as follows : we divide the unit square into @xmath67 many small squares ( called _ boxes _ ) in such a way that , essentially , we no longer need to worry about the precise locations of the random points , but only need to know which of the boxes are occupied by at least one point . in this way , our analysis of the process reduces to an analysis of appropriate random subgraphs of a large finite square grid ( or king s move grid , see section  [ sec : online.lb.pf ] below ) . with some technical work , the results for this grid then translate back to the original geometric setting to give the desired results .",
    "_ lower bound proofs_. the key idea in the proofs of the lower bound parts of both theorems [ thm : online ] and [ thm : offline ] is the following : to avoid the formation of large connected components of occupied boxes ( and thus also of large connected components in the original power of choices random geometric graph setting ) , we designate a subset of the boxes as the `` barrier '' .",
    "this barrier separates the unit square into `` small '' parts ( see figure  [ fig : moat ] ) .",
    "the player s goal is to prevent the appearance of paths of occupied boxes crossing the barrier . in both settings",
    ", he selects points outside the barrier whenever possible .",
    "his main worry are the pairs of points that both fall into the barrier , as these force him to select a point in the barrier .",
    "blocks of dimensions @xmath68 , when @xmath69 is large ( left ) and when @xmath69 is small ( right ) . ]    in the offline scenario , it is not too hard to show that even if the barrier is only a ( moderately large ) constant number of boxes wide , then w.h.p . there is a choice of points for which the barrier is not crossed . the proof of this relies on an ( approximate ) analogy of our setting with the erds ",
    "rnyi random graph in its subcritical stage , where the boxes in the barrier play the role of the vertices and the pairs of points that both fall into the barrier yield the edges .    in the online scenario ,",
    "we can only ensure that the barrier will not be crossed if it is at least @xmath70 boxes wide .",
    "our strategy here is more involved ; the key part is to set things up in such a way that , essentially , we can invoke theorem  [ thm : azaretal ] to argue that w.h.p .",
    "the barrier will not be crossed . to that end",
    ", we divide the barrier into `` blocks '' consisting of @xmath71 boxes , and pay special attention to the blocks that become `` dangerous '' because , oversimplifying slightly , only relatively few more occupied boxes are required to create a ( potentially crossing ) long path inside them .    _",
    "upper bound proofs_. a key ingredient in both our upper bounds proofs is a simple isoperimetric inequality for subgraphs of the square grid .",
    "it allows us to conclude from the fact that there are relatively few unoccupied boxes that a significant proportion of the occupied boxes must belong to relatively large connected components of the graph induced by all occupied boxes .    for the offline case ,",
    "we use this as part of a combinatorial counting argument .",
    "essentially , we count the number of sets of boxes whose removal decomposes the grid graph into `` small '' components . more precisely , in order to keep the total number of sets to be considered sufficiently low",
    ", we will only count appropriate _ subsets _ of decomposing sets as described . by an expectation argument",
    ", we will then show that w.h.p",
    ". the player will not be able to avoid a single one of these sets and , therefore , will be forced to create a `` large '' ( linear - sized ) component .    for the online case , we use a two - round approach and analyze the process after @xmath72 points rounds as an intermediate step . to this end",
    ", we divide the grid graph into `` b - blocks '' consisting of @xmath73 boxes , and define an appropriate notion of `` good '' b - blocks [ see figure  [ fig : superblocks](b ) on page ] . we show that at time @xmath72 , w.h.p .",
    "most boxes of the original grid graph are occupied , and that as a consequence most b - blocks are good .",
    "it follows with the mentioned isoperimetric inequality that a bounded number of connected components of the graph of b - blocks ( defined in the obvious way  b - blocks are adjacent if they share a side ) covers most of the unit square .",
    "conditional on that , we then show that in the remaining @xmath72 rounds of the process , w.h.p .",
    "at least one of these components will evolve into a linear - sized component of the original grid graph . to show that the player can not avoid this",

    "we offer the following two natural conjectures .",

    "the player will be forced to create a component with @xmath644 vertices : we have @xmath645 as @xmath643 in ( [ eq : def - eps ] ) , and the resulting factor of @xmath646 is squared when ( a  slightly adapted version of ) lemma  [ lem : online.ub.area ] is applied .",
    "similarly , the upper bound proof given in section  [ sec : online.ub.pf ] for the online setting shows that w.h.p .",

    "this can be shown with only minor modifications to the proofs we gave for @xmath658 .    to give some intuition for these formulas ,",
    "let us point out the following : in both scenarios , the threshold corresponds to the point where the _ number of points that are forced to be in the barrier _ ( as defined in our lower bound proofs ) equals the _ number of boxes of the barrier _ in order of magnitude . in the online scenario ,",
    "the barrier has an area of @xmath659 , and thus the ( expected ) number of points that we need to choose in the barrier is of order @xmath660 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of boxes in the barrier is of order @xmath661 .",
    "it is not hard to see that these terms are equal for @xmath1 as stated .",
    "the threshold for the offline case can be motivated with a very similar calculation .    _ creating a giant . _",
    "another interesting related question is what happens if the player attempts to speed up the onset of a giant component instead of delaying it . for this setup",

    "holds , we just need to note that even if we allow the player to keep _ both _ points in each round he will just have a subcritical or critical random geometric graph . the proof of part ( ii ) is only slightly more involved .",
    "a sketch of the argument is as follows : the player fixes a small square @xmath227 of area @xmath668 inside the unit square , and he always selects a point inside @xmath227 if he can ( if both fall in @xmath227 he chooses randomly ) .",
    "if @xmath133 was chosen sufficiently small , then the graph induced by the points in @xmath227 will be a _",

    "our strategy for @xmath669 case is rather simple , and in a sense it might be suboptimal .",
