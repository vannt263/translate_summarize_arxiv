    "similar to spintronics , valleytronics is a new rising discipline and referred to as the electronics based on the valley degree of freedom ( _ d.o.f . _ ) of electrons in 2d honeycomb lattice systems@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the valleytronics device , similar to the spintronics device , shall have a lower energy consumption , faster processing speed , and higher integration density in comparison to the traditional charge - based electronic device .",
    "the valley refers to each of the energetically degenerate , but nonequivalent structures in the energy bands of crystalline materials .",
    "a typical example is the monolayer graphene that has two valleys in the reciprocal space , denoted as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valley , respectively , and they are related by the time reversal symmetry like the spin _",
    "_ of electrons .",
    "due to the large momentum difference between the two valleys in graphene , the intervalley scattering is severely suppressed@xcite in clean samples and the valley is largely a conserved quantum number in electron transports .",
    "thus , it is suggested that the valley could be utilized as an information carrier .    since the valleytronics is still in its infancy , the main challenges in this field are the generation , detection , and manipulation of valley currents .",
    "many proposals have been studied to generate valley currents by using graphene nanoribbon@xcite , lattice strain@xcite , electromagnetic field@xcite , optical field@xcite , and line defects@xcite .",
    "a pseudovalley - exchange interaction was also proposed by authors@xcite in the graphene superlattice system to modulate the valley state . as for the valley detection ,",
    "the usual way is the optical excitation method based on the valley - dependent selection rule@xcite .",
    "very recently , three groups have successfully and independently measured the topological valley current flowing in the monolayer@xcite or bilayer graphene@xcite by a purely electric means via the inverse quantum valley hall effect ( qvhe ) .",
    "as is known , the monolayer graphene with broken inversion symmetry is a quantum valley hall insulator@xcite , i.e. , a quantized valley hall current can be induced by a longitudinal electric field @xmath7 , because electrons undergo a momentum deflection due to the nonzero berry curvature of massive dirac electrons that resembles a magnetic field rotating a moving charge .",
    "the berry curvatures in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valleys are opposite to each other , so that the valley hall current is a pure valley current without any accompanied charge current . as a result ,",
    "the experimental observation of such valley hall current is generally to utilize the inverse qvhe to transform it nonlocally into a measurable voltage or current signal , similar to the measurement of the pure spin current .",
    "gorbachev _ _ et al.__@xcite measured a strong nonlocal resistivity signal at the charge neutral point of the graphene in a four terminal hall - bar device , where the monolayer graphene was placed on the hexagonal boron nitride and an energy gap at dirac points is opened .",
    "while the measured nonlocal resistivity @xmath0 represents the topological valley current generated via the qvhe , an important issue remains intact why the measured @xmath0 is not quantized when the fermi energy resides in the energy gap , since the valley hall conductivity is quantized .",
    "generally speaking , the conductance or resistivity quantization in a quantum hall effect shall be very robust and not difficult to detect .",
    "thus , it is desirable to find the discrepancy between the experimental observation@xcite and theoretical prediction@xcite of the qvhe .    in this work ,",
    "we study numerically the experimental four - terminal hall - bar device of a gapped monolayer graphene , which is denoted by a staggered potential applied to the carbon a and b sites .",
    "the nonlocal resistivity is calculated according to the multi - terminal landauer - bttiker formula in the linear transport regime . in the clean limit",
    ", we show that the quantized @xmath1 is possible when the hall - bar width is larger than its length ( @xmath8 ) and the fermi energy resides in the energy gap . in the opposite case @xmath9 ,",
    "the quantized @xmath0 are severely destroyed and exponentially decreases to zero , @xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the experiment result@xcite that the quantized @xmath0 can be extrapolated from the measured data at the limit of @xmath10 . outside of the bulk energy gap , the @xmath0",
    "is shown to be very sample - parameter dependent , but can not exceed the quantized one ( @xmath11 ) . the quantized @xmath0 is also shown immune to the rough edges of the device and static disorders .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the hall - bar device based on a lattice model is outlined and the numerical method to the nonlocal resistivity is presented .",
    "numerical results are given in sec .",
    "iii and the origin of the quantized @xmath0 is also discussed in detail .",
    "a brief conclusion is drawn in the last section .",
    "is the hall - bar width and @xmath12 is its length representing the distance between the current and voltage contacts , and @xmath13 denotes the extended length of the h shape device .",
    "( b ) plot of the qvhe and inverse qvhe processes for the generation of a nonlocal voltage signal .",
    "a valley current is flowing along the y - axis direction due to the qvhe induced by the electric field @xmath14 , and a voltage signal is generated between the lead 3 and 4 due to the inverse qvhe.,width=216 ]",
    "before we describe our model to calculate the nonlocal resistivity induced by the combined qvhe and inverse qvhe , we first recall the qvhe physics in a gapped graphene . in order to open an energy gap of the massless dirac electrons with a linear energy dispersion , a staggered potential breaking the inversion symmetry of graphene is often introduced in the lattice . experimentally , the general method is to deposit the graphene on the hexagonal boron nitride layer due to the very lattice match .",
    "the low - energy continuum hamiltonian of graphene without the inversion symmetry@xcite is given by @xmath15where @xmath16 are the pauli matrices of the lattice pseudospin , @xmath17 are the momentum operators ; @xmath18 denotes the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valleys ; @xmath19 is the fermi velocity ; the last term is the staggered potential with its strength @xmath20 denoting the site - energy difference between carbon a and b atoms . here",
    "the real spin is neglected and assumed degenerate in this work . from the eigenvalue @xmath21 of the above hamiltonian",
    ", an energy gap with its width @xmath22 is seen at the dirac point and the gapped graphene is insulating .    using the kubo formula for the d.c .",

    "one can directly derive out the valley - related hall conductivity@xcite as @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the fermi energy , and the valley hall conductivity is quantized as @xmath32 , when the fermi energy is in the energy gap @xmath33 .",
    "the kubo formula above can be also written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the berry curvature of massive dirac electrons accounting for the momentum deflection with the help of an external electric field .",
    "all physics variables in the hall conductivity formula above [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] is independent of the electric field @xmath7 , since the system is assumed to be in an equilibrium state ( without interactions from the external electric field @xmath7 ) required by the linear response theory . in other words ,",
    "the valley hall conductivity @xmath36 should not depend explicitly on the electric field and can be evaluated without @xmath7 considered in the equilibrium hamiltonian .",
    "certainly , the valley hall current @xmath37 will rely on the longitudinal electric field @xmath14 , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the landauer - bttiker formula in the linear transport regime can be used to calculate this valley hall conductivity @xmath36 in principle . as a matter of fact",
    ", the landauer - bttiker formula for a simple two - terminal device can be derived from the linear response theory and the behind physics is that the transport properties of the system are generally determined by the electrons near fermi energy .",
    "the gapped graphene is actually a valley chern insulator@xcite , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the valley chern number , so a longitudinal electric field @xmath7 can lead to a topologically - protected valley hall current .",
    "it is noted that unlike the charge or spin chern insulator , there is no edge state along the boundary of the sample supporting dissipationless valley currents , because the vacuum ( insulator ) has no such valley definition@xcite .",
    "an indirect method is needed to measure the valley current , and thus the four - terminal hall - bar device is usually employed to detect the qvhe by measuring the nonlocal resistivity @xmath0 . in the schematic setup plotted in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the contact @xmath41 and @xmath42 are assumed to be the current contacts , upon which an external bias @xmath43 is applied . while the contact @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the voltage probes",
    "through which no electric current is flowing . a pure valley current",
    "shall first be generated to flow along the @xmath46-direction via the qvhe , and then it will be transformed into a voltage signal in contact @xmath44 and @xmath45 due to the inverse qvhe , this is schematically drawn in fig .",
    "due to the lack of edge stats , the longitudinal conductivity of the gapped graphene is zero ( @xmath47 ) although the valley hall conductivity is quantized @xmath48 , so the nonlocal resistivity should also be quantized in terms of the reversibility , @xmath49 . however , the current experiment ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) failed to observe directly this quantized @xmath0 .",
    "a tight - binding hamiltonian is employed to describe the gapped graphene in fig .",

    "it is not difficult to work out the voltage @xmath74 and @xmath75 in terms of the bias @xmath43 .",
    "then , the nonlocal resistivity is defined as @xmath76     versus the fermi energy @xmath31 in a nanosize hall - bar graphene geometry with either the armchair - edge ( a ) or zigzag - edge ( b ) termination .",
    "parameters are @xmath77 nm and @xmath78 . ,",
    "in this section , we will carry out the numerical calculations of @xmath0 as functions of the device parameters according to the above formulae .",
    "the four ideal graphene leads are assumed identical with the same width @xmath79 , the hall - bar length @xmath12 denotes the distance between the current contacts ( lead @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) and voltage probes ( lead @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) , and @xmath80 is the width of the hall bar as depicted in fig .",

    "we first present numerical results of @xmath0 in the nanosize hall - bar device as a function of the fermi energy @xmath31 .",
    "it is shown in fig .  2 that a nonzero @xmath0 indeed appears irrespective of zero or nonzero staggered potential @xmath20 in the graphene and exhibits extreme sensitivity to the system parameters .",
    "this agrees with a recent work @xcite that a nonzero @xmath0 was found in the nanosize graphene without an energy gap . for the armchair - edge device [ fig .",

    "moreover , @xmath0 can be positive or negative for different fermi energies and different edge types of graphene .",
    "all these indicate that in the nanosize device , the electron scattering at the boundaries of the sample should dominate the nonlocal resistivity and the obtained @xmath0 should not exclusively denote the topological valley current generated by qvhe . especially , the nonzero @xmath0 at the pristine graphene ( @xmath83 and there is no qvhe ) can merely stem from the intervalley scattering at the boundaries of the sample or the possible pseudolattice spin hall effect .     as a function of the fermi energy @xmath31 in the armchair - edge ( a ) and ( c ) , and zigzag - edge ( b ) and ( d ) device . @xmath84",

    "@xmath0 exhibits similar irregular oscillations when @xmath91 .    for both types of graphene edges in fig .  3",
    ", the quantization is the same .",
    "in fact , other chiral edges of graphene ( mixture of the zigzag and armchair types ) as well as different graphene or nongraphene leads do not change this quantization a little ( not shown ) .",
    "additionally , the extension length @xmath13 of the device in fig .",
    "1(a ) does not affect the quantization of @xmath0 , either , and thus neglected in our calculations .",
    "since the quantization of @xmath0 is not sensitive to small variation of the sample parameters , it should not come from very parameter - dependent scattering of electrons but the intrinsic qvhe .",
    "one can see @xmath92 from fig .  3 , and this is consistent with the valley hall conductivity @xmath93 different from the usual hall conductivity .",
    "since the quantization of @xmath0 is closely dependent on the relative magnitudes of @xmath80 and @xmath12 of the studied hall - bar structure , we compute @xmath0 with variation of @xmath12 and @xmath80 and present the results in fig .",
    "it is seen that for a fixed @xmath80 , @xmath1 remains unchanged roughly at @xmath8 , whereas it is destroyed at the case of @xmath3 and will exponentially decrease .",
    "this phase - transition behavior , @xmath94 or @xmath95 , occurs in the whole energy gap @xmath33 .",
    "alternatively , the critical length @xmath96 for quantized @xmath0 is independent of energy @xmath31 as long as it resides in the gap @xmath33 .",
    "we can work out the critical length @xmath96 defined as the exponential decay length of @xmath0 and a phase diagram is plotted in fig .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath96 approximates to @xmath80 in a comparatively large device , @xmath97 , except for the onset point @xmath10 .",
    "this relationship is nearly independent of the lead width @xmath79 used in calculations [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] as well as the edge types of the device .",
    "therefore , we have the relationship @xmath98 . certainly , the transport here is entirely controlled by quantum theory in the clean limit and not in the diffusive regime .",
    "the experimental observation of the valley diffusive length@xcite @xmath99 , which is valid even for bilayer graphene@xcite , might relate to this quantum confinement requirement , @xmath97 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the quantized @xmath100 at @xmath10 can be extrapolated from the experimentally measured data@xcite , and this is consistent with our results .     in the energy gap as a function the hall - bar length @xmath12 with different @xmath80 .",
    "( b ) critical length @xmath96 for the quantized @xmath0 versus the hall - bar width @xmath80 .",
    "the zigzag - edge device edge is considered here and the armchair - edge one has the same result ( not shown ) .",
    "parameters are @xmath88 nm , @xmath101 , @xmath78 nm , and @xmath102.,width=312 ]    we have shown that the hall - bar width @xmath80 is a crucial factor for the quantized @xmath0 and even at the limit of @xmath103 , @xmath100 is still valid . before elaborating its origin , we should keep in mind that the topological valley current ( quantized valley conductivity , @xmath48 ) generated via the qvhe is not related to any edge states , but sustained by the whole valence band@xcite , because there is no topologically - protected edge state in the gapped graphene , even for a finite - size device we studied here . in the following , we present an intuitive interpretation of the condition @xmath104 for quantized @xmath100 .",
    "it is assumed that a valley current arising from the qvhe is flowing along the @xmath46-direction in fig .",
    "for the electron moving in the narrow hall - bar region , @xmath105 is required for a complete transverse mode , where @xmath106 is the @xmath107-component wavelength of the electron , while there is no such limitation for the longitudinal wavelength @xmath108 , because the electrodes are posited at the two ends of the length @xmath12 .",
    "those electrons momenta will be deflected by the berry curvature in the inverse qvhe process , and meanwhile , the electron energy @xmath31 is assumed to be conserved in the transport , so the @xmath108 and @xmath106 approximately exchange to each other in this inverse qvhe process .",
    "not all electrons can directly complete such energy - conserved momentum deflection or interchange when @xmath3 , and those @xmath109 wave quantum states shall necessarily involve the superposition of different waves including different valleys . it is this intervalley scattering that leads to the exponential decrease of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4(b ) , as a result , the transport of the inverse qvhe is actually in the diffusive regime , although no defect or disorder was considered in our calculations . for the opposite case @xmath8 , all waves including the maximum waves @xmath110 can be deflected into the @xmath108 wave transporting along the @xmath46 direction , i.e. , all electrons can successfully complete the qvhe process at @xmath2 , so the @xmath0 is quantized at @xmath33 .",
    "we wish to point out that the electron deflection may bring about the intervalley scattering , because the the valley _",
    "d.o.f _ unlike the spin or charge , is defined in the reciprocal space and thus closely related to the graphene lattice profile , e.g. , the electron wavevector ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) is given by ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) in the brillouin zone with @xmath115 being an integer , and then , the momentum exchange or rotation ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 ) can not ensure the deflected electron staying in the same valley , when the width and length ( @xmath80 , @xmath12 ) of a graphene device are not matched very well .",
    "the above results are based on the pure quantum transport in the clean limit . in the following ,",
    "we proceed to study the disorder effect on the nonlocal resistivity @xmath0 .",
    "generally , the long - ranged interaction like charge impurities shall not provide intervalley scattering due to the large momentum difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 valleys , whereas the short - ranged one can indeed contribute to the intervalley scattering . here , we consider the harder case , short - ranged disorders in the graphene lattice . in calculations , each carbon site on the sample assumes a random on - site energy in the range of [ @xmath118,@xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the disorder strength , the four contacts still keep clean without any disorder , and the results are averaged over @xmath121 disorder configurations .    in fig .  5 ,",
    "the @xmath0 is plotted with a variation of the disorder strength @xmath120 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath0 can easily be suppressed when @xmath91 , but the quantized platform displays quite robust against disorder . around the band center @xmath122 ,",
    "the @xmath0 quantization is much stronger than that at the band edge @xmath123 . as discussed earlier , the nonzero @xmath0 signal outside of the energy gap ( @xmath91 ) has the contribution from the electron s scattering that is sensitive to the sample parameters such as the fermi energy , size , and edge types , subsequently , the disorder can easily get rid of such oscillation of @xmath0 .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) that the @xmath0 at @xmath91 will decrease to zero around @xmath124 and then will continuously increase at @xmath125 because of the closure of the bulk energy gap of graphene .    for @xmath33 ,",
    "the @xmath0 is only generated via the qvhe so that it should be protected by the topology of the gapped graphene and immune to a moderate disorder .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 versus @xmath20 in fig .",
    "5(b ) confirms this point .",
    "the @xmath0 at the charge neutral point can survive in a much stronger disorder environment , @xmath126 .",
    "this is not found in other topological insulators , e.g. the quantized conductance of the helical edge states in a quantum spin hall insulator can only survive in the disorder with the strength lesser than the bulk energy gap .",
    "there are two concerning factors that may account for the extremely strong @xmath0 : one is that the @xmath0 is contributed by the whole valence band@xcite and the gapped graphene ( quantum valley hall insulator ) has no gapless edge state ; the other comes from the fact that the valley conductivity is an even function of the energy @xmath31 different from other hall effects , @xmath93 , the charge fluctuation due to disorder can not smash the @xmath0 greatly .     as a function of the fermi energy @xmath31 within different disorder strengths .",
    "( b ) @xmath0 versus the disorder strength @xmath120 for different fermi energies .",
    "parameters are @xmath127 nm , w@xmath128 nm , @xmath87 nm , and @xmath101 . , width=216 ]    the obtained results of @xmath0 dependence on the disorder is quite different from a recent work by ando@xcite , who found that the valley hall conductivity @xmath129 by using a low - energy continuum model can be enhanced by disorder when @xmath91 , and even be larger than the quantized one @xmath130 .",
    "this immediately implies that the @xmath0 should also increase with the disorder .",
    "however , the @xmath0 at @xmath91 here is suppressed greatly instead of enhancement as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) when the disorder is no too strong @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath0 increases with disorder only when @xmath125 but can not exceed the quantized value . in this strong disorder case",
    ", the energy gap of the graphene shall be closed by the disorder and the nonlocal @xmath0 signal mainly come from the electron scattering or the pseudolattice spin hall effect .",
    "this situation is the same as the nonzero @xmath0 at @xmath83 found in fig .  2 .",
    "therefore , the increasing of @xmath0 with @xmath120 for @xmath91 in fig .",
    "5(b ) shall arise from the effect of the electron scattering at the device boundary , not fully from the qvhe found in ref .",
    "certainly , the sample boundary is the main difference considered in our model from ref .",
    "@xcite , and therefore , it should be an important factor to be seriously taken into account in making valley - based devices .",
    "in summary , we have numerically investigated the qvhe in the gapped graphene by calculating the nonlocal resistivity in a hall - bar structure . based on a lattice model and the multiple - terminal landauer - bttiker formula ,",
    "we have shown that the nonlocal resistivity is quantized @xmath1 representing the qvhe when the hall - bar length is smaller than its width ( @xmath8 ) and the fermi energy resides in the bulk energy gap @xmath33 , and it decreases rapidly at the @xmath3 case , @xmath131 .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the valley",
    "_ d.o.f _ is defined in the reciprocal space and the electron deflection in real space by the nonzero berry curvature may lead to the intervalley scattering .",
    "the quantized @xmath0 is not sensitive to other system parameters such as graphene - edge types and is also shown very robust against static disorders .",
