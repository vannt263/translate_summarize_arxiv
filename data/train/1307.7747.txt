    "recall that the _ erds  rnyi random graph _ with edge probability @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 , is a graph with @xmath25 vertices where each of the @xmath26 possible edges is included with probability @xmath27 , independently of the others .",
    "a sequence @xmath28 is called a _ sharp threshold _ for a graph property @xmath29 if for all constants @xmath30 , if @xmath31 then whp @xmath32 , and if @xmath33 then whp @xmath34 .",
    "recall that for a ( weak ) threshold , the conditions assume @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "we also use the non - standard notion of a _ semisharp threshold _ , which only requires the existence of some constants @xmath37 such that the properties above hold .",

    "caro , lev , roditty , tuza and yuster @xcite showed that @xmath39 is a semisharp threshold for @xmath40 , and he and liang @xcite proved that for general @xmath41 , @xmath42 is a semi - sharp threshold for @xmath43 . as observed by friedgut @xcite",
    ", a coarse threshold can only occur near rational powers of @xmath25 . from theorem 1.4 in @xcite , if the semi - sharp threshold for @xmath43 were not sharp , there would be a sequence @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for some constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 , a contradiction .",

    "however , it seems that the situation for @xmath6 is fundamentally different from the case @xmath4 , and the methods used in @xcite do not carry over to the general case . in fact , there are good reasons to believe that the following may be the true sharp threshold for @xmath43 where @xmath6 .",

    "conditional on @xmath0 having @xmath67 edges , which holds with very high probability , there are @xmath68 possible edge colourings .",
    "the probability that there exists at least one rainbow colouring is then bounded by the total number of colourings multiplied with the probability that a random colouring is a rainbow colouring , which tends to  @xmath69 .",
    "the best known upper bound for the sharp threshold of the property @xmath43 is @xmath70 , which was shown in the proof of the semi - sharp threshold in @xcite .",

    "the proof is organised as follows . in section [ preliminaries ] some of the known bounds needed for our later work will be reviewed .",
    "section [ generalobservations ] contains general observations on the distribution of edges of each colour and paths of length @xmath3 in the randomly coloured graph .",
    "the heart of the proof is section [ themainlemma ] , where the key lemma is proved .",
    "this lemma ensures that when we later select a path of length @xmath3 for every dangerous pair of vertices and recolour it to make it a rainbow path , it is possible to do so without using any edges from a path that was previously assigned to another dangerous pair of vertices .",
    "finally , in section [ finishingtheproof ] , the recolouring procedure will be described in detail and it will be shown that we can indeed find a rainbow @xmath3-colouring of the edges of @xmath0 with this strategy .",
    "[ edgesofeachcolour ] let @xmath103 be constant , let @xmath104 be a set of vertices with @xmath105 , and let @xmath106 .",
