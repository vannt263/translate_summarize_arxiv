    "the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in a staggered magnetic field has attracted increasing interest as the number of real materials it describes continues to rise .",
    "while the model in zero field is gapless in all dimensions , the staggered field lowers symmetries , changes universality classes , and induces gapped states and unconventional , gapped elementary excitations .",
    "intensive investigations into staggered - field effects in quantum magnets were motivated originally by inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the quasi-1d spin chain copper benzoate.@xcite application of a uniform magnetic field to this material caused an unexpected gap to open in the excitation spectrum .",
    "this energy gap follows a power law as a function of the applied magnetic field , but its magnitude depends strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "this unusual experimental finding was soon explained@xcite by the fact that copper benzoate is not a perfect chain , but has an alternating crystal structure giving rise to a staggered gyromagnetic tensor , possibly accompanied by a dzyaloshiskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",

    "in addition to the superexchange coupling @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the dm vector , @xmath3 the external field , and @xmath4 are the uniform and staggered components of the gyromagnetic tensor . by making a local gauge transformation , which rotates the spins on two separate sublattices , and by neglecting all contributions at higher orders in @xmath5 , eq .",

    "( 2 ) has no significant role for weak magnetic fields , in fact the uniform and staggered components may compete .",
    "a complete description of systems with dm interactions in arbitrary fields still requires the full exploration of the original hamiltonian ( 1 ) . a systematic investigation by wang and coworkers@xcite using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) technique showed that the low - energy , high - field properties of copper benzoate are dominated by the uniform magnetic field , on which the spin gap depends linearly , while a crossover regime exists at intermediate fields .",
    "this prediction was later confirmed by esr experiments in applied fields up to 35 t.@xcite    most staggered - field studies have focused on materials which are almost ideally 1d in nature , such as copper benzoate,@xcite copper pyrimidine,@xcite @xmath12,@xcite and @xmath13.@xcite however , real materials always have some interchain coupling , which in some cases may be comparable to the staggered magnetic field , if not also to the intrachain coupling . how the interchain interaction may change the essential physical properties",
    "remains an open question .",
    "recent experiments on the weakly coupled chain system @xmath142(dimethylsulfoxide ) ( cdc)@xcite indicate that a gap opens at a finite value of @xmath7 , rather than at zero , when the uniform magnetic field is applied ; the power - law dependence of the excitation gap seems to be different from that observed in quasi-1d materials .",
    "early attempts to understand this behavior include calculations for the two - leg ladder,@xcite which show a qpt taking place as a consequence of the competition between the staggered magnetic field and the interchain coupling .",
    "a chain mean - field theory developed@xcite to study the spin gap as function of the staggered field in 2d and 3d found a spin gap opening immediately with the applied field ( the `` noncompetitive case '' defined in sec .",

    "in particular , the linear dependence of the excitation gaps on the magnetic field appears to be inconsistent with experiment.@xcite in this paper we contribute to the understanding of coupled heisenberg chains in staggered magnetic fields by performing continuous - time monte carlo simulations using the worm algorithm,@xcite and use our results to discuss the influence of interchain interactions and staggered fields on the ground state and the low - energy excitations .",

    "we do not aim to make a direct comparison with experiment , but rather to demonstrate the physical properties which may motivate the search for and characterization of an appropriate material in this class .",

    ", we use the continuous - time worldline quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method with `` worm '' updates .",
    "the concept of continuous - time worldlines was first induced in qmc by n.  v.  prokofev and coworkers in 1996.@xcite unlike the standard , discrete - time qmc algorithms , which are based on the suzuki - trotter decomposition , in the continuous - time method the hamiltonian @xmath28 is separated into a diagonal term and a perturbation term . for a time - dependent perturbation , the partition function @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath30 $ ] , with @xmath31 the matsubara evolution operator , @xmath32 in which @xmath33 . in this series ,",

    "based on this continuous - time worldline formulation , prokofev and coauthors also developed an update algorithm based on breaking a worldline by inserting a pair of creation and annihilation operators , which then evolve by local moves.@xcite ( this became known as the `` worm '' update from the motion of pairs of worldline kinks . ) the algorithm considers two configuration spaces , denoted z and g : while z contains only closed worldlines , and is the space of the partition function , g contains a worldline broken by a physical process connecting points @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the z and g configuration spaces can be exchanged by creation or annihilation of an @xmath23 `` worm '' pair on the same flat worldline .",
    "this is equivalent to processes in the grand canonical ensemble . in the g configuration space , processes which move the worms in both time ( changing worm position in the imaginary time direction on the same site ) and space ( the worm is moved to a neighboring site , creating or annihilating a kink ) update the configuration and",
