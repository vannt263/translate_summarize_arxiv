    "the volume operator for loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) enters the quantum dynamics of the theory in a prominent way . without it , hamiltonian constraint operators @xcite",
    ", master constraint operators @xcite or physical hamiltonian operators @xcite can not be defined .",
    "this is also true for truncated models of lqg such as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite which is supposed to describe well the homogeneous sector of the theory . in lqc one",
    "generically finds that the quantum evolution of operators corresponding to classically singular dirac observables remain finite .",
    "this feature can be traced back to the way that inverse powers of the local volume , which enter into the expression for the triad , cotriad and other types couplings between geometry and geometry or geometry and matter , are quantized in the full theory @xcite .",
    "namely such derived operators are obtained as commutators between holonomy operators and powers of the volume operator .    in view of its importance , it is of outmost interest to verify that the classical limit of the lqg volume operator coincides with the classical volume . by this",
    "we mean that the expectation value of the volume operator with respect to suitable semiclassical states which are peaked on a given point in phase space coincides with the value of the classical volume at that phase space point up to small corrections and that its fluctuations are small .",
    "notice that there are actually two versions of the volume operator discussed in the literature @xcite which result from nonequivalent regularisations of the products of operator valued distributions that appear at intermediate stages .",
    "however , only the operator in @xcite survives the consistency test of @xcite , namely that writing the volume in terms of triads which then are quantized using the above mentioned commutator , delivers the same operator up to @xmath2 corrections as the direct quantization .",
    "this check is not unimportant as otherwise we should not trust the triad and cotriad quantisations that enter the quantum dynamics .",
    "the semiclassical analysis of the volume operator has not been carried out yet although in principle suitable semiclassical ( even coherent ) states for lqg are available @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the spectral decomposition ( projection valued measure ) of the volume operator can not be computed exactly in closed form which however is needed in order to do exact practical calculations . more precisely , the volume operator is the fourth root of a positive operator @xmath3 whose matrix elements can be computed in closed form @xcite but which can not be diagonalized analytically .",
    "more in detail , the volume operator has discrete ( that is , pure point ) spectrum and it attains a block diagonal form where the blocks are labelled by the graphs and spin quantum numbers ( labelling the edges of the graph ) of spin network functions ( snwf ) @xcite .",
    "snwf s form a convenient basis of the lqg hilbert space @xcite which is the unique ( cyclic ) hilbert which carries a unitary representation of the spatial diffeomorphism group and the poisson@xmath4algebra of the elementary ( flux and holonomy ) variables @xcite .",
    "the blocks turn out to be finite dimensional matrices whose matrix elements can be expressed in terms of polynomials of 6j symbols which fortunately can be avoided using a telescopic summation technique @xcite related to the elliot  biedenharn identity @xcite so that a manageable closed expression results .",
    "however , the size of these matrices grows exponentially with increasing spin quantum numbers and since the expression for coherent states is a coherent superposition of snwf s with arbitrarily large spin quantum numbers , a numerical computation of the expectation value using numerical diagonalisation techniques which are currently being developed @xcite is so far out of reach    the way to make progress is to use semiclassical perturbation theory developed in @xcite and already applied in @xcite .",
    "the idea is quite simple : in practical calculations one needs the expectation value of @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a rational number in the range @xmath7 .",
    "introduce the `` perturbation operator '' @xmath8 where the expectation value @xmath9 of the positive operator @xmath3 is exactly computable .",
    "notice that @xmath10 is bounded from below by @xmath11 .",
    "then trivially @xmath12^q>$ ] .",
    "now we use that there exist positive numbers @xmath13 such that the classical estimates @xmath14 are valid for all @xmath15 .",
    "finer estimates of this form involving arbitrary powers of @xmath16 are also available @xcite . in view of the spectral theorem ,",
    "this classical estimate survives at the quantum level and we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath20 and @xmath21/<q>^2 $ ] is proportional to the relative fluctuation of @xmath3 which of order of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it follows that to zeroth order in @xmath2 we may replace @xmath22 by @xmath23 which is computable and whose error estimates are also computable as shown above .    while possible , the exact computation of @xmath24 is still quite involved . here",
    "the following result , proved in @xcite , is convenient : the computation of these expectation values ( more generally for low order polynomials in flux operators ) for @xmath25 spin network states coincide , to zeroth order in @xmath2 , with the corresponding calculations for @xmath26 spin networks . on those ,",
    "the volume operator is even diagonal .",
    "hence we conclude that , as long as we are only interested in the zeroth order in @xmath2 contribution , we may evaluate the expectation value of the volume operator for a fictive theory in which we may replace the non abelian group @xmath25 by the abelian group @xmath27 which makes all calculations dramatically simpler .",
    "the coherent states developed for lqg so far all have been constructed using the complexifier method reviewed in @xcite which generalizes the coherent state construction for phase spaces that are cotangent bundles over compact groups developed in @xcite .",
    "this involves the heat kernel evolution of the delta distribution ( which is the matrix element of the unit operator in the schrdinger ( position ) representation ) with respect to a generalized laplace operator , called the complexifier , followed by a certain analytic continuation .",
    "now the unit operator in lqg can be written as a resolution of unity in terms of snwf s and although the heat kernel is a damping operator , since the snwf are not countable ( the lqg hilbert space is not separable ) , the resulting expression is not normalizable .",
    "it defines a well defined distribution ( in the algebraic dual of the finite linear span of snwf s ) which can be conveniently written as a sum over cut  off states labelled by finite graphs .",
    "these states , called `` shadows '' in @xcite , _ are _ normalizable and one can use those in order to perform semiclassical calculations .",
    "of course , one expects that only cut  off states labelled by graphs which are sufficiently fine with respect to the classical three metric to be approximated are good semiclassical states .",
    "hence we see that the input in the semiclassical calculations consists in the choice of a complexifier and the choice of a graph .",
    "one may wonder why the complexifier has to be chosen and is not dictated by the dynamics of the theory , that is , that the coherent states remain coherent under quantum time evolution ( e.g. for the harmonic oscillator , the complexifier is strictly the laplacian on the real line ) .",
    "the reason is twofold : + on the one hand one could perform constraint quantization and then we are working at the level of the kinematical hilbert space on which the quantum constraints have not been imposed yet and all we want to make sure is that the volume operator , which is not gauge invariant ( and thus does not preserve the physical hilbert space ) has a good classical limit on the kinematical hilbert space ( we would not trust a constraint quantization for which not even that was true ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , one could also work at the level of the physical hilbert space as outlined in @xcite and then one would expect that the time evolution of any reasonable choice of complexifier coherent states with respect to the physical hamiltonian defined there remains coherent ( and peaked on the classical trajectory ) for sufficiently short time intervals . notice that for interacting theories as simple as the an - harmonic oscillator globally stable coherent states have so far not been found .",
    "the choice of the complexifier will be guided by practical considerations , namely that it be diagonal on snwf s and that it is a damping operator which makes the heat kernel evolution of the delta distribution restricted to a graph normalizable .",
    "moreover , it should be gauge invariant under the @xmath25 gauge group . as far as the choice of the graph is concerned , for practical reasons one will choose graphs that are topologically regular , that is , have constant valence for each vertex .",
    "indeed , the semiclassical calculations performed in @xcite were done using graphs of cubic topology with good semiclassical results .",
    "the existing literature on such coherent states for lqg can be divided into two classes , depending on a certain structure that defines them : + on the one hand , there are _ gauge covariant flux",
    "_ coherent states which depend on collections of surfaces and path systems inside them @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are _ area _ coherent states which only depend on collections of surfaces but involve area operators rather than flux operators @xcite .",
    "we will review and generalize both constructions .",
    "in its most studied incarnations , the collection of surfaces involved in @xcite is defined by a polyhedronal partition of the spatial manifold while the collection involved in @xcite is in terms of a parquette of foliations of the spatial manifold .",
    "the novel results of this article are as follows :    * _ cylindrically consistent complexifier _ + the important thing to notice is that both constructions are cylindrically consistent : both derive from a complexifier which is graph independently defined in terms of the surfaces ( and path systems ) only and has consistent cylindrical projections to spin network functions over any graph .",
    "we stress this , because from the discussion in @xcite one may get the impression that the states constructed there do not come from a single complexifier operator .",
    "we clarify this in this paper by explicitly constructing those projections .",
    "the apparent contradiction is resolved by observing that in @xcite cut  off states were displayed only for graphs which are dual to a fixed polyhedronal complex . in this paper",
    "we treat the general case which is more complicated .",
    "we also give a compact expression for the eigenvalues of the complexifier of type @xcite which is missing there .",
    "* _ graphs of arbitrary valence",
    "_ + the real motivation for the present article is that the calculations performed in @xcite raised the suspicion that the volume operator attains acceptable coherent state expectation values only for graphs of cubic topology .",
    "therefore in this paper we perform the semiclassical analysis with respect to topologically regular graphs of valence @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "ideally one would like to treat the general case but this leads to complicated book keeping problems .",
    "fortunately , the cases we consider turn out to be sufficient to answer the afore posed question .",
    "the outcome of our analysis is that , no matter whether one uses the states @xcite or @xcite , _ the correct semiclassical limit is attained with these states for @xmath1 only_. in other words : + _ up to now , there are no semiclassical states known for other than cubic graph topology ! _",
    "we interpret this result as saying that the states we constructed are simply not semiclassical for the volume operator unless @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio consisting of expectation value of the volume operator with respect to the coherent states for graphs of valence @xmath30 divided by the classical value deviates from unity by a geometrical factor @xmath31 depending on @xmath28 which is of order unity and not at all of order @xmath2 .",
    "one might argue that therefore one should rescale the volume operator by @xmath32 .",
    "however , first of all this is not allowed because the normalization is fixed @xcite and secondly even if one would rescale , the statement would still be that the correct expectation value is attained for a unique valence only .",
    "it may be that there are other semiclassical states coming from a different complexifier or from an entirely different method which does not have this problem .",
    "however , notice that all coherent states that were constructed so far for free field theories on minkowski space come from a complexifier , so the complexifier method is natural and well tested in other contexts @xcite .",
    "secondly , as shown in @xcite , the choice of a su(2 ) invariant and background metric invariant complexifier for lqg with computable spectrum and the required damping behavior leaves relatively little possibilities and to the best of our knowledge , the states proposed in @xcite and used here are the simplest and only ones known so far .",
    "therefore , even if better suited states exist , they will be very hard to guess and even harder to do practical calculations with .",
    "the implication of our result for lqg then seems to be that the semiclassical sector of the theory is spanned by snwf based on cubic graphs .",
    "this has some bearing for spin foam models @xcite which are supposed to be  but have so far not been proved to be  the path integral formulation of lqg .",
    "spin foams are certain state sum models based on simplicial triangulations of four manifolds whose dual graphs are therefore five valent . since the intersection of this graph with a boundary three manifold is therefore four valent , we see that spin foam models based on simplicial triangulations corresponds to boundary hilbert spaces spanned by spin network states based on four valent graphs only .    but even if these mismatches between lqg and spin foams could be surmounted , the result of our analysis seems to say that _ the boundary hilbert space of current spin foam models does not contain any semiclassical states ! _ this seems to contradict recent findings that the graviton propagator derived from spin foam models comes out correctly @xcite .",
    "however , notice that these results only show that the propagator comes out with the correct fall off behavior while the correct tensorial structure has not been verified yet .",
    "+ an easy way to possibly repair this is to generalize spin foam models and allow for arbitrary , in particular cubic , triangulations as suggested in @xcite .",
    "+   + the outline of this paper is as follows : +   + in section two we review the general complexifier method and generalize the complexifier coherent states proposed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we review the two families of coherent states introduced so far which are based on complexifiers constructed from squares of flux or area operators respectively",
    ". we also explicitly compute the corresponding cut  off states for su(2 ) and show when and why it is justified to work with a fictive @xmath26 theory instead as far as the zeroth order in @xmath2 for the expectation values is concerned .    in section three",
    "we construct explicitly convenient tetrahedronal , cubical and octaheronal cell decompositions of the spatial manifold which also define regular dual @xmath29 valent dual graphs .",
    "these constructions are needed for the explicit calculations in section four and for our companion paper @xcite .    in section four",
    "we compute the expectation value of the volume operator for the constant valence cases @xmath29 for the states of type @xcite .",
    "we will do the same in our companion paper @xcite for the states of type @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite we answer the following question : while the flux complexifier is built from a discrete set of fluxes , the area complexifier is built from a continuous set of areas whose underlying surfaces fill all of space .",
    "while this makes the calculations more cumbersome , it might improve the quality of the corresponding coherent states in the sense that the expectation values do not strongly depend on the cut  off graph chosen ( as already mentioned above , at least when the graph has cubic topology ) .",
    "hence , we examine the question whether the expectation value of geometrical operators is invariant under euclidean transformations of the graph in case that the spatial metric to be approximated is euclidean .    in section five",
    "we summaries and conclude .",
    "in this section we review the complexifier method to construct coherent states",
    ". we will be brief , all details can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "this section is divided into six parts : + in the first we define the general complexifier framework . in the second we provide natural gauge invariant choices of complexifiers for background independent su(2 ) gauge theories such as general relativity and fictive @xmath26 gauge theories . in the third",
    "we compute the associated coherent states .",
    "these are not normalizable because they involve a sum over an uncountable set of graphs but one can extract from them normalizable states in which the sum over all graphs is cut off to a finite number and which we display in the fourth part . in the fifth part",
    "we compare the properties of the states @xcite and @xcite . finally ,",
    "in the sixth we show that as far as the zeroth order in @xmath2 is concerned , we may replace the complicated @xmath25 calculations by the much simpler @xmath26 calculations under certain restrictions on the cut  off graph .",
    "this approximation is needed only for states of type @xcite . for the states of type @xcite",
    "it is sufficient to take as a cut  off graph any graph which is dual to the polyhedronal complex that defines the complexifier .",
    "we consider a symplectic manifold @xmath33 which is a cotangent bundle over a configuration manifold @xmath34 which may be infinite dimensional ( we will suppress any indices in what follows ) .",

    "we take here a practical attitude and would like to consider a complexifier which comes close to the maxwell one ( [ 2.11 ] ) which obviously satisfies all the requirements of definition [ def2.1 ] .",
    "since we have applications in general relativity in mind , we must preserve background independence and therefore the minkowski background laplacian entering ( [ 2.11 ] ) must be replaced by something background metric independent .",
    "one possibility is to use a background independent laplacian which depends on the dynamical 3-metric of @xmath113 which @xmath114 is its triad .",
    "however , this would lead to a very complicated object with which no practical calculations are possible .",
    "in fact , the practical use of coherent states in maxwell theory rests on the fact that ( [ 2.11 ] ) is quadratic in the momenta ( electric fields ) which leads to states which are basically gaussians in both the position and the momentum representation .",
    "this motivates to keep our complexifier quadratic in the momenta as well .",
    "furthermore , we must preserve @xmath78 invariance . for abelian gauge theories the electric fields are already gauge invariant but not for non abelian gauge theories .",

    "a standard tetrahedron is the subset [ 5.13 ] t_0=\\{s^3:0s^i1;i=1,2,3,s^1+s^2+s^31 } it has four boundary triangles given by [ 5.14 ] t^0_i & = & \\{s^3 : s^i=0 , 0s^j , s^k 1,s^j+s^k1;_ijk=1 } + t^0_4 & = & \\{s^3:0s^i1;i=1,2,3 , s^1+s^2+s^3=1 } we easily compute [ 5.15 ] vol_0(t_0)= while ( remembering that the surfaces carry outward orientation if the edges are outgoing from @xmath338 ) [ 5.16 ] f_i(t^0_j)= _ ij , f_i(t^0_4)=- let us label the edges adjacent to @xmath338 by @xmath406 where @xmath407 is dual to @xmath408 . then [ 5.17 ] vol_0(v ) & = & = + & = & which still depends on the sign factors .",
    "hence the expectation value takes values in the range @xmath409 none of which coincides with @xmath410 . for the explicit four valent graph that we constructed in section ( [ s3 ] ) each triple among the four edges has linearly independent tangents at @xmath338 and the expectation value is given by @xmath411 which is too large .",
    "a standard cube is the subset [ 5.18 ] c_0=\\{s^3:0s^i1;i=1,2,3 } it has six boundary squares given by [ 5.19 ] s^0_i + & = & \\{s^3 : s^i=1 , 0s^j , s^k 1;_ijk=1 } + s^0_i - & = & \\{s^3 : s^i=0 , 0s^j , s^k 1;_ijk=1 } we easily compute [ 5.20 ] vol_0(t_0)=1 while ( remembering that the surfaces carry outward orientation if the edges are outgoing from @xmath338 ) [ 5.21 ] f_i(s^0_j ) = _ ij with @xmath412 .",
    "let us label the edge dual to @xmath413 by @xmath414 .",
    "then the expectation value becomes [ 5.22 ] vol(v)= which again depends on the precise embedding of the graph .",
    "for an actual cubical graph constructed in section [ s3 ] , the edges @xmath415 are analytic continuations of each other so that the orientation factor vanishes if two or more edges carry the same direction label @xmath176 .",
    "otherwise there are more contributions . which orientation factors are allowed has been analyzed in detail in @xcite . in the case of the actual cubical graph",
    "we have @xmath416 so that ( [ 5.22 ] ) becomes [ 5.23 ] vol(v)= = 1 which coincides with ( [ 5.20 ] ) .      a standard octahedron is the subset [ 5.24 ] o_0=\\{s^3 : |s^3| , |s^1|,|s^2| -|s^3| } it has eight boundary triangles given by [ 5.25 ] t^0_i ",
    "= \\{s^2 : 0 s^3 , s^i=(-|s^3| ) , |s^j| -|s^3| } where @xmath417 .",
    "we easily compute [ 5.26 ] vol_0(o_0)= while ( remembering that the surfaces carry outward orientation if the edges are outgoing from @xmath338 ) [ 5.27 ] f_i(t^0_j )=[_ij+ _ i3 ]    labelling the edge dual to @xmath418 by @xmath419 we find for the expectation value [ 5.28 ] vol_0(v ) = where @xmath420 is the alternating symbol for @xmath421 with @xmath422 . expression ( [ 5.28 ] ) is already very complicated to analyse for the most general edge configuration and again we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive discussion .",
    "however , for the case of the graphs constructed in section [ s3 ] the situation becomes simple enough .",
    "namely in this case the eight edges @xmath423 have the property that @xmath424 and @xmath425 are analytic continuations of each other .",
    "this implies that @xmath426 where @xmath427 is the common starting point of all edges .",
    "since @xmath428 is completely skew in @xmath429 , in this case we can simplify ( [ 5.28 ] ) to [ 5.29 ] vol_0(v ) & = & + & & since ( [ 5.29 ] ) only depends on @xmath430 , after proper change of summation variables , ( [ 5.29 ] ) turns into [ 5.29a ] vol_0(v ) = using that @xmath431 and @xmath432 are both antisymmetric under the simultaneous exchange @xmath433 etc",
    ". we may further simplify ( [ 5.29a ] ) to [ 5.30 ] vol_0(v ) & = & + & & carrying out the respective sums over @xmath434 and using that @xmath435 is completely skew we can bring all orientation factors into one of the two standard forms @xmath436 and @xmath437 respectively . after proper relabelling of the @xmath438",
    "we find that [ 5.31 ] vol_0(v ) = since @xmath439 is skew in @xmath440 the sum over @xmath441 collapses to the term @xmath442 and ( [ 5.31 ] ) becomes [ 5.32 ] vol_0(v ) & = & + & = & finally , using @xmath443 and + @xmath444 we find [ 5.33 ] vol_0(v)= which does not agree with ( [ 5.26 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , for both valence @xmath445 or @xmath446 the expectation value is larger than the expected value with the same ratio @xmath447 . in general",
    ", for generic edge configurations and for higher and higher valence the expectation value will probably also be larger in ratio than the expected volume .",
    "this is because for a vertex of valence @xmath28 the number of ordered triples of edges contributing to the expectation value is given by @xmath448 and for appropriate choice of the orientation factors , these terms all contribute with the same sign .",
    "such a choice is always possible up to topological obstructions discussed to some extent in @xcite . for large @xmath28 the polyhedron dual to the vertex will approach more and more a sphere triangulated into @xmath28 polygonal faces of typical unit area @xmath449 .",
    "hence we expect the leading @xmath28 behavior of the expectation value to be given by @xmath450 while the expected volume should approach @xmath451 .",
    "surely , we have not shown that for graph topologies different from a cubical one the expectation value of the volume operator with respect to the dual cell complex coherent states can not be matched with the classical volume value .",
    "this is because one can allow degenerate triples which decrease the volume expectation value .",
    "however , the discussion reveals that the question for which graphs the expectation value comes out correctly is far from trivial and even for natural choices the only admissible graph topology is the cubical one .",
    "notice that the expectation value is insensitive to the embedding of the graph relative to the dual cell complex as long as the graph is dual to it . for non dual embeddings or graph topologies which do not match the cell complex topology at all , the expectation value will be completely off the correct value .",
    "this demonstrates that the cut  off graph must lie within a certain class which is adapted to the cell complex .",
    "together with the analysis in @xcite we have shown that the only known states of lqg which are semiclassical for the volume operator must be based on cubic cut  off graphs .",
    "this looks surprising at first but can maybe be understood intuitively as follows :    the volume operator is a derived operator and arises from the known representation of the flux operator on the hilbert space .",
    "the derivation involves a regularization step which involves cubes surrounding the verticies of the graph in question on whose faces the fluxes are located . in order to take the limit in which the cubes shrink to the verticies and in order to make the result independent of the relative orientation between cubes and graphs , an averaging procedure must be applied .",
    "hence one might be tempted to say that the fact that cubical topology is singled out rests on the cubical regularization .    however , this is not the case .",
    "namely , cylindrical consistency and background independence alone already fix the cylindrical projections of the volume operator up to a global constant as proved explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the constant depends on the averaging procedure chosen and on whether one uses tetrahedra rather than cubes in the regularization",
    ". however , consistency between volume and flux quantization fixes that factor @xcite and rules out the operator @xcite . that is to say",
    ", there is no freedom left in defining the volume operator and therefore the details of the regularization do not matter , it is a regularization independent result",
    ". hence , the preference for cubic graphs in the semiclassical analysis must have a different origin .    to see what it is ,",
    "notice that the volume operator at a vertex involves a sum over ordered triples of edges adjacent to the vertex of which only the those with linearly independent tangents contribute .",
    "if the vertex has valence @xmath28 then typically there are @xmath452 contributions @xcite .",
    "they all contribute with equal weight ( up to sign ) which is the unique factor determined in @xcite . that constant is such that each triple contributes as if ( the tangents of ) a triple of edges spans a corresponding parallelepiped .",
    "however , it is clear that generally far less than @xmath452 parallelepiped are sufficient to triangulate a ( dual ) neighborhood of the vertex and thus it is not surprising that large valence cut  off graphs will not give rise to good semiclassical states . on the other hand , unless the graph is cubic , even at low @xmath445 the parallelepiped volume contribution per triple is too high for the triangulation of a tetrahedron .",
    "we have seen both effects at work in the previous section .",
    "this result has two implications : either one is able to find new types of states which are not constructed by the complexifier method or by different complexifiers than the ones employed so far such that the correct semiclassical behavior is recovered also for graphs of different than cubic topology . or , if that turns out to be impossible , one should accept this result and conclude that , in order that the boundary hilbert space of spin foam models has a semiclassical sector , one should generalize them to more general than simplicial triangulations of the four manifold as advocated in @xcite .",
