    "a non - monotonic energy dependence of the @xmath9/@xmath10 ratio with a sharp maximum close to 30 a@xmath2gev is observed in central pb+pb collisions @xcite . within a statistical model of the early stage @xcite , this is interpreted as a sign of the phase transition to a qgp , which causes a sharp change of the energy dependence of the strangeness to entropy ratio .",
    "this observation naturally motivates us to study the production of multistrange hyperons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) as well as the function of the beam energy .",
    "although this is the main motivation for our study of @xmath12 production in p+p and pb+pb collisions , there are two other points of interest .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in p+p collisions could give quite detailed information on the dynamics of strangeness production in those collisions .",
    "from string - hadronic models , it is expected that the @xmath1/@xmath0 ratio in p+p interactions at sps energies is higher than 1 whereas it is predicted to be smaller than 1 in a hadron gas model @xcite . +",
    "furthermore it was suggested that the kinematic freeze - out of @xmath12 takes place directly at hadronization @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the transverse momentum spectra of the @xmath12 directly reflect the transverse expansion velocity of a hadronizing qgp @xcite .",
    "+ in this report we show preliminary results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 production in central pb+pb collisions at 30 , 40 and 158 a@xmath2gev and compare them to data from p+p interactions at 158 gev .",
    "we also show fully corrected rapidity and @xmath4 spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath2gev .",
    "integration of the rapidity spectra gives the total yield of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in full phase space .",
    "the na49 detector @xcite ( see fig.[experiment ] ) is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer at the cern sps , consisting of four tpcs .",
    "two of them , the vertex tpcs ( vtpc ) , are inside a magnetic field for the determination of particle momenta .",
    "the ionisation energy loss ( de / dx ) measurement in the two main tpcs ( mtpc ) , which are outside the magnetic field , is used for particle identification .",

    "both are extrapolated back to the target and the point of the closest approach is calculated @xcite .",
    "the resulting combinatorial background is reduced by applying various cuts .",
    "the contribution of false @xmath14 ( @xmath19 ) candidates can be reduced by selecting the decay ( anti-)proton candidates using their energy loss in the tpcs .",
    "the same procedure is used to reduce background in the sample of @xmath16 ( @xmath9 ) candidates .",
