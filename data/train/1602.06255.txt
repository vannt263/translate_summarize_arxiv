    "presently , the only efficient means of studying the diffuse gas surrounding galaxies ( a.k.a . halo gas or the circumgalactic medium , cgm ) and in between galaxies ( a.k.a . the intergalactic medium , igm ) is through absorption - line spectroscopy of luminous , background quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , because the principal transitions to diagnose gas lie at far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) wavelengths ( @xmath4 ) , for @xmath5 studies one requires uv spectrometers on space - borne facilities .",
    "currently , and for the foreseeable future , the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) affords the only opportunity for such research , primarily with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) .",
    "given the modest aperture of _ hst _ , these observations are generally restricted to the brightest fuv quasars on the sky .",
    "high - quality , fuv spectroscopy of @xmath0 quasars have enabled several , unique experiments to study the cgm and igm of the universe over the past @xmath6gyr .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) the survey of highly ionized gas via the neviii  @xmath7 doublet and/or broad  systems that may trace the elusive warm - hot ionized medium ( whim ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) the search for signatures of galactic and agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 3 ) the measurements of enrichment in galactic halos and optically thick gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( 4 ) revealing the structure of the cosmic web and its correlation to the large - scale structures traced by galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while each of these programs has had scientific impact , they are limited by sample variance .    an efficient way to increase the volumes surveyed is to focus on those bright uv qsos that maximize the redshift path covered , i.e. those with @xmath8 . to date , only a small number of @xmath0 quasars have been observed with _ hst _ , primarily corresponding to the set of sources with very high fuv flux .",
    "these have been drawn from historical , large - area surveys for agn ( e.g.  the palomar - green bright quasar survey and the hamburg / eso survey ) and more recently the northern galactic pole footprint of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "cross - matching the quasar sample of @xcite against the point - source catalog of the galex survey , one recovers @xmath9 sources with @xmath10 and fuv  @xmath11mag ( fewer than 50 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "these are preferentially located within the sdss footprint which has extensively surveyed the northern galactic pole for quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given that _",
    "hst _ may observe nearly any position on the sky , we are motivated to perform an all - sky search for new , fuv - bright quasars across the sky . indeed , progress in this area demands the discovery of new fuv - bright quasars .",
    "the principal goal of our survey is to provide the community with a nearly complete set of uv - bright , agn before the termination of the _ hst _ mission .",
    "we recognized that the combination of two nasa imaging missions ",
    "galex and wise  enables a modern , all - sky search for uv bright quasars .",
    "these must be spectroscopically confirmed , however , before subsequent _ hst _ observations .",
    "given our interest in fuv - bright sources , this implies optically bright candidates that can be spectroscopically confirmed on 3m - class telescopes .",
    "the following manuscript provides the first data release ( dr1 ) from our uv - bright quasar survey ( uvqs ) .",
    "the main data products are available at the mikulski archive for space telescopes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sample ] describes the uvqs candidate selection , focused on detecting @xmath0 quasars with fuv  @xmath13mag .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopy is discussed in section  [ sec : obs ] and the redshift analysis is described in section  [ sec : z ] .",
    "we present the primary results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "when relevant , we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "with the explicit goal of discovering new fuv - bright quasars at @xmath0 across the sky , we developed color - color criteria leveraging the all - sky surveys of the wise and galex missions to : ( i ) isolate agn ; and ( ii ) maximize the probability that these agn lay at @xmath17 .",
    "for the first criterion , we followed the impressive results from the wise team who demonstrated the clean separation of agn from stars , galaxies and other astrophysical sources using wise photometry @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that agn tend to exhibit @xmath18mag with galaxies and stars having smaller values .",
    "although this criterion may not capture all agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we strongly expect that every uv - bright agn satisfies the criterion .",
    "indeed , we find that of the 1148 quasars at @xmath19 from sdss dr7 detected by galex ( @xmath20 ) , all have @xmath21mag ( figure  [ fig : color_cuts ] ) .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these have @xmath22 ( 90% ) .    mag .",
    "it is evident that each has a @xmath23mag color , consistent with the @xcite selection - criteria for agn .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 quasars exhibit redder @xmath25 colors which we hypothesize results from intervening lyman limit opacity .",
    "the gray dashed lines at @xmath26mag and @xmath27mag indicate the color - color criteria adopted for our primary candidates ( table  [ tab : candidates ] ) . , width=336 ]    figure  [ fig : color_cuts ] also shows the @xmath25 colors of these quasars .",
    "these were measured from the  photoobjall \" catalog of the galexgr6plus7 context at mast and improved , where possible , using the mis catalog .",
    "we see that the majority of @xmath22 quasars have @xmath28mag ( 60% ) and that nearly all of the @xmath24 quasars have a redder @xmath25 color .",
    "we believe that this ` reddening ' primarily results from the presence of one or more lyman limit systems ( llss ) in the redshift interval @xmath29 whose continuum opacity reduces only the fuv flux .",
    "we infer that nearly every @xmath0 quasar exhibits at least one intervening lls are often referred to as partial lls or plls . ] with @xmath30 .",
    "with our photometric criteria established ,    @xmath31    we cross - matched every source in the galexgr6plus7 catalogs ; and nuv_mag @xmath32 .",
    "we then used the following for the mis to improve the photometry : select objid , ra , dec , fuv_mag as fuv , nuv_mag as nuv from bcscat_mis ; where fuv_mag between 12 .",
    "and 18.5 ; and ( fuv_mag - nuv_mag ) between -0.5 and 2.0 ; and fuv_mag @xmath32 ; and nuv_mag @xmath32 . ]",
    "satisfying these criteria against the allwise source catalog . to avoid selecting already known quasars given the beam sizes of wise and galex , we then eliminated any sources that lay within @xmath33 of a uv - bright quasar from sdss dr7 .",
    "this generated a list of  primary candidates ( table  [ tab : candidates ] ) .",
    "we discovered , during our analysis , that this candidate list includes hundreds of previously cataloged sources from other surveys .",
    "this includes the sdss - iii survey which included wise - selected quasar targets ( paris et al .",
    "their primary wise criteria , however , precluded overlap with our sample . given that several of these surveys have known examples of false redshift identifications or do not provide the discovery spectra , we maintained the list and re - observed many of the brighter sources ( @xmath3mag ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : candidates ] shows an all - sky summary of the uvqs candidates , separated by @xmath34 flux .",
    "the exclusion of the galactic plane is obvious and the lower incidence of sources in the sdss footprint is notable .",
