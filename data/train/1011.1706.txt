    "the realization of quasi one - dimensional ultracold boson gases with tunable interaction parameters @xcite and the succeeding advances in atom chip trap technology @xcite have renewed interest in theoretical models of one - dimensional bosons with short - ranged interactions .",
    "of particular relevance to workers in this field is the lieb - liniger model @xcite in which contact interactions are described by dirac delta functions .",
    "the suitability of this model in describing the low temperature properties of these quasi one - dimensional bosonic systems has been further strengthened by olshanii s analysis of the low energy scattering of atoms under tight transverse harmonic confinement : the longitudinal @xmath5-wave scattering amplitudes are indeed reproduced by a one - dimensional pseudopotential proportional to a dirac delta function @xcite .",
    "the resulting demonstration that the magnitude of this effective delta interaction can be explicitly calculated from the three - dimensional atomic scattering length and the dimensions of the confining external trap @xcite further strengthens the link between theoretical one - dimensional models and quasi one - dimensional experiments .",
    "still , the free lieb - liniger model is quite an idealization for actual experiments because the atoms are generally longitudinally confined by an external potential and thus much effort has been devoted to studying the effects of confinement of interacting bosons @xcite . introducing an external harmonic potential to the free lieb - linger model of spinless bosons",

    "the corresponding eigenvalue equation is solvable by the bethe ansatz and consequently much is known about the ground state and elementary excitations of this system @xcite , as well as the properties of the various correlation functions at zero and finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , for the important case of harmonic confinement an exact solution to this problem for general values of the interaction strength @xmath0 is lacking .",
    "the sole exceptions are the two - particle case that is separable in relative and central coordinates @xcite , and the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit of infinite repulsion @xmath15 in which the exact @xmath1-particle wavefunctions are absolute values of slater determinants @xcite .",
    "these results , especially the latter , are prototypical examples of the fermion - boson duality derived by girardeau @xcite and later generalized by cheon and shigehara @xcite for one - dimensional systems of particles having contact interactions . for finite values of the interaction parameter @xmath0 , expressions for the atomic density and collective oscillation frequencies",

    "indeed , for as few as @xmath73 particles the factor @xmath66 is quite well approximated ( within 1% ) by the function @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , the correction factor @xmath66 reaches its asymptotic scaling behavior for systems as small as @xmath76 .    to obtain a thermodynamic limit with an extensive ground state energy",
    ", we observe that in addition to sending the number of particles to infinity we must also require the trapping frequency @xmath8 to vanish as @xmath77 .",
    "as we shall see , this condition allows us to reproduce the thomas - fermi results near the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "this scaling requirement implies that the quantity @xmath78 approaches a constant in the thermodynamic limit , in contrast to the thermodynamic limit in the case of a lieb - liniger gas confined in a flat - bottomed box , in which the linear dimension of the system is taken to scale proportionally with particle number @xcite . looking back at our asymptotic expression @xmath79 , we find that the quantity @xmath80 approaches a constant value as @xmath16 in our prescribed thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is precisely the condition used by ma and yang @xcite to obtain the ground state energy of the trapped interacting boson gas in the thomas - fermi formalism , which we reproduce here in figure [ energyn]b .",
    "we find that our first - order @xmath2 result is reliable for @xmath81 , which means that for a typical experimental setup with hundreds of atoms first - order perturbation theory and the thomas - fermi result coincide only in the extreme repulsion limit @xmath82 .",
    "if we now define the tonks - girardeau limit chemical potential as @xmath83 and the scaled interaction parameter as @xmath84 , we obtain the zero temperature chemical potential @xmath85.\\ ] ] the first term in this expression corresponds to the chemical potential of free fermions in a one - dimensional harmonic trap while the last term gives the reduction in the chemical potential due to the finite repulsion correction and serves as a measure of the departure of the system from the unitarity limit .",
    "in this work we have calculated the first - order finite repulsion correction to the ground state energy of harmonically trapped bosons having contact interactions for any finite number of particles @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath76 we found that for a fixed interaction strength this correction scales as a power law @xmath3 , which allowed us to describe a thermodynamic limit that reproduces known results from thomas - fermi approaches .",
    "this contribution clarifies the smooth transition of the ground state properties of an harmonically confined interacting boson system as the particle number goes from finite @xmath1 to infinity near the tonks - girardeau limit .",
    "we have demonstrated that in this strongly interacting regime , to at least leading order in @xmath2 , finite number effects are negligible in current experimental situtations that have @xmath86 atoms .",
    "a natural extension of this work would involve higher order corrections to the ground state energy and many - body wavefunction , as was done recently for a wedge - shaped trapping potential @xcite .",
    "if we take the set of all fermionic slater determinants as an expansion basis for ordinary perturbation theory about the tg limit , we discover that the perturbing pseudopotential couples the ground state to an infinite number of excited states .",
    "we therefore expect a complicated analytical result for the second order energy correction resulting in a numerical problem that may require a truncation of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "however , on the basis of the agreement between our asymptotic results and the thomas - fermi calculation ( figure [ energyn]b ) , we conjecture that the second order correction scales as @xmath87 in the thermodynamic limit .",
