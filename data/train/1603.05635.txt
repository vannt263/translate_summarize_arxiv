    "the study of hypernuclei , bound systems composed of nucleons and one or more hyperons , provides a unique tool to extent our present knowledge of conventional nuclear physics to the @xmath7-flavour sector @xcite .",
    "hypernuclei were discovered in 1952 with the observation of a hyperfragment in a ballon - flown emulsion stack by danysz and pniewski @xcite .",
    "these initial cosmic - ray observations of hypernuclei were followed later by pion and proton beam production reactions in emulsions and @xmath8he bubble chambers .",
    "the weak decay of the @xmath0 hyperon into a @xmath9 plus a proton was used to identify different @xmath0-hypernuclei and to determine the binding energies , spins and lifetimes for hypernuclei up to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "average properties of heavier systems were estimated from spallation experiments , and two double-@xmath0 hypernuclei were reported from @xmath11 capture @xcite .",
    "more systematic investigations of hypernuclei began with the advent of separated @xmath12 beams , which allowed to produce single @xmath0-hypernuclei through @xmath13 _ strangeness exchange reactions _ , where a neutron hit by a @xmath12 is changed into a @xmath0 emitting a @xmath9 .",
    "the analysis of these reactions , initially carried out at cern and later at bnl , kek and j - parc , showed many of the hypernuclear characteristics such as , for instance , the small spin - orbit strength of the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) interaction , or the fact that the @xmath0 essentially retains its identity inside the nucleus . the use of @xmath14 beams at bnl , kek and gsi has permitted to perform @xmath15 _ associated production reactions _ , where an @xmath16 pair is created from the vacuum , and a @xmath17 and a @xmath0 are produced in the final state .",
    "the _ electro - production _ of hypernuclei at jlab and mami - c by means of the reaction @xmath18 provides a high precision tool for the study of hypernuclear spectroscopy @xcite due to the excellent spatial and energy resolution of the electron beams .",
    "the hyphi collaboration at fair / gsi has recently proposed a completely new and alternative way to produce hypernuclei by using stable and unstable heavy ion beams @xcite .",
    "a first experiment has been already performed using a @xmath19li beam on a @xmath20c target at 2 a gev , in which the @xmath0 and the @xmath21h and @xmath22h hypernuclei have been observed @xcite .",
    "nowadays more than 40 single @xmath0-hypernuclei , and few double-@xmath0 @xcite and single-@xmath23 @xcite ones have been identified . on the contrary ,",
    "it has not been possible to prove without any ambiguity the existence of @xmath24-hypernuclei ( see _ e.g. , _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) which suggest that the @xmath24-nucleon interaction is most probably repulsive @xcite .    a simple theoretical description of @xmath0-hypernuclei consist of an ordinary nuclei with the @xmath0 sitting in the single - particle states of an effective @xmath0-nucleus mean field potential . several approaches , based on this simple description ,",
    "have been used to study the properties of the @xmath0 in finite nuclei .",
    "woods - saxon potentials , for instance , have been traditionally used to describe , in a shell model picture , the single - particle properties of the @xmath0 from medium to heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "density dependent effects and non - localities have been included in non - relativistic hartree  fock calculations with skyrme type yn interactions in order to improve the overall fit of the single - particle energies @xcite .",
    "hypernuclear structure calculations have been also performed on the framework of relativistic mean field theory @xcite and dirac phenomenology @xcite .",
    "several hypernuclear structure studies based on _ ab - initio _ approaches exist in the literature @xcite . in these studies",
    "the single - particle properties of the @xmath0 in the hypernucleus are derived from effective yn @xmath25-matrices built from bare yn interactions which describe the scattering data in free space .",
    "recently , a quantum monte carlo calculation of single- and double-@xmath0 hypernuclei has also been done using two- and three - body forces between the @xmath0 and the nucleons @xcite .    in most of these approaches ,",
    "the quality of the description of hypernuclei relies on the validity of the mean field picture .",
    "however , the correlations induced by the yn interaction can substantially change this picture and , therefore , should not be ignored . whereas the correlations of nucleons in nuclear matter and finite nuclei have been extensively studied by many authors ( see _ e.g. , _ refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the correlations of hyperons have not received so much attention up to date .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the effect of the @xmath0 correlations in nuclear matter , beyond the mean field description , have been only studied by robertson and dickhoff @xcite .",
    "these authors used the green s function formalism @xcite to study for the fist time the propagation of a @xmath0 in nuclear matter .",
    "they calculated the spectral function and quasi - particle parameters of the @xmath0 finding results qualitatively similar to those of the nucleons , and showed that the @xmath0 is , in general , less correlated than the nucleons .",
    "the knowledge of the single - particle spectral function of the @xmath0 in finite nuclei is fundamental not only to determine up to which extent the mean field description of hypernuclei is valid , but also for a proper description of the cross section of the different production mechanism of hypernuclei .",
    "information on the single-@xmath0 spectral function can be obtained from a combined analysis of data provided by _",
    "@xmath18 reactions or other experiments with theoretical calculations . however , as far as we know , until now the single-@xmath0 spectral function in finite nuclei has never been calculated .",
    "the scope of this work is to determine it for a variety of hypernuclei . to such end",
    ", we use a perturbative many - body approach to determine first the @xmath0 self - energy in finite nuclei from which we can then obtain the single-@xmath0 spectral function and the @xmath0 single - particle bound states for the different hypernuclei .",
    "the manuscript is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sf ] we describe in detail the method employed to determine the @xmath0 spectral function in finite nuclei .",
    "results for the @xmath0 self - energy , single - particle bound states , spectral function and disoccupation numbers in several hypernuclei from @xmath1he to @xmath2pb are presented and discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : sumcon ] .",
    "in this section we describe the calculation of the single-@xmath0 spectral function in a hypernucleus .",
    "the starting point of this calculation is a nuclear matter yn @xmath25-matrix evaluated in momentum space at fixed nuclear matter density , center - of - mass momentum and starting energy .",
    "this nuclear matter @xmath25-matrix is then used to construct a finite nucleus yn @xmath25-matrix from which we can obtain the self - energy of the @xmath0 in the brueckner ",
    "hartree  fock ( bhf ) approximation , and the corresponding spectral function , for different single - particle bound and scattering states of an effective hyperon - nucleus potential in several hypernuclei .",
    "the calculation is done using some of the yn interactions of the jlich @xcite and the nijmegen @xcite groups .",
    "the description of our calculation is presented in the following after some few general remarks on the single - particle propagator and the spectral function .",
    "it is well known in quantum many - body theory that the propagation of a particle or a hole with incoming ( outgoing ) quantum numbers @xmath26 and energy @xmath27 that is added to a given @xmath28particle system is described by the single - particle green s function ( or propagator ) @xmath29 , which can be obtained by solving the dyson equation @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free single - particle propagator with @xmath32 being the hamiltonian of the non - interacting @xmath33-particle system , @xmath34 its corresponding ground state of energy @xmath35 and the minus ( plus ) sign in front of the second term is for bosons ( fermions ) .",
    "@xmath36 is the proper or irreducible self - energy that from now on will be simply referred as self - energy .",
    "particularly useful is the so - called lehmann representation of the propagator @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ground state of the @xmath28particle interacting system and @xmath39 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the @xmath40particle one .",
    "alternatively , the lehmann representation of the propagator can be written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the particle and the hole parts of the single - particle spectral function which are defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 we note that @xmath46 and @xmath47 give , respectively , the probability density of adding or removing a particle with quantum numbers @xmath48 to the ground state of the @xmath28particle system , and finding the resulting @xmath49 or @xmath50particle one in an excited state of energy @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 ) or @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) .    it is easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) and ( [ eq : sh ] ) that @xmath42 and @xmath43 fulfill the following sum rule @xmath55_\\mp|\\psi^{n}_0 \\rangle=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , \\label{eq : sumrule0}\\ ] ] where ,",
    "in the last equality , it has been used @xmath56_\\mp=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$ ] and assumed @xmath57 .    after these general remarks let us consider the particular case of a @xmath0 hyperon that is added to a pure nucleonic system such as _ e.g. , _ infinite nuclear matter or an ordinary nuclei .",
    "it is clear that , since there are no other @xmath0 s in the @xmath28particle pure nucleonic system , the @xmath0 can only be added to it and , therefore , the hole part of its spectral function is zero .",
    "the lehmann representation of the single-@xmath0 propagator is then simply given by @xmath58 similarly , the sum rule expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule0 ] ) is simplified , reading in this case @xmath59 where we have used that the action of the operator @xmath60 , which annihilates a @xmath0 hyperon with quantum numbers @xmath48 , on the pure nucleonic state @xmath61 is zero because this state does not contains any @xmath0 .",
    "our calculation of the @xmath0 self - energy is based on a method that was originally developed to study the properties of the nucleon @xcite and the @xmath62 isobar @xcite in finite nuclei , and was later extended to study those of the @xmath0 and @xmath24 hyperons @xcite . in the following",
    "we present a general description of this method and refer the interested reader to these works , in particular to refs .",
    "@xcite , for specific details of the calculation .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath0 self - energy in finite nucleus starts with the construction of all the yn @xmath25-matrices which describe the in - medium interaction between a hyperon ( y@xmath63 ) and a nucleon in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath25-matrices are obtained by solving the coupled - channel bethe  goldstone equation which schematically reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the bare yn interaction , @xmath66 is the pauli operator , that prevents the nucleon in the intermediate state y@xmath67n@xmath67 to be scattered below its fermi momentum @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the so - called starting energy which is the sum of the non - relativistic single - particle energies of the interacting hyperon and nucleon .",
    "we note here that the bethe ",
    "goldstone equation has been solved in momentum space in the partial wave basis @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are respectively the center - of - mass ( relative ) momentum and orbital angular momentum , @xmath73 is the total spin , @xmath74 is the total angular momentum , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the total isospin and its third component , and @xmath77 .",
    "we note also that when solving it , the so - called discontinuous prescription has been adopted , _",
    "i.e. , _ the single - particle energy of the hyperon ( @xmath78 ) and the nucleon ( @xmath79 ) in the intermediate state y@xmath67n@xmath67 is taken simply as the sum of the non - relativistic kinetic energy plus the mass of the corresponding baryon .",
    "finally , we should mention that our calculation has been done at nuclear matter density @xmath80 @xmath81 , zero center - of - mass momentum and @xmath82 mev , where @xmath83 mev is an averaged value for the sum of the single - particle mean fields of the nucleon ( @xmath84 mev ) and the @xmath0 ( @xmath85 mev ) at this density .",
    "the dependence of our results on the values of the nuclear matter density @xmath86 and the starting energy @xmath69 is weak as it is shown _",
    "e.g. , _ in refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    ", one can find @xmath87 by relating it to the nuclear matter @xmath25-matrix already obtained .",
    "eliminating the bare interaction @xmath65 in both finite nucleus and nuclear matter bethe  goldstone equations , @xmath87 can be written in terms of @xmath25 through the following integral equation , written in a simplyfied form as @xmath88g_{fn } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & g+g\\left[\\frac{q_{fn}}{e_{fn}}-\\frac{q}{e}\\right]g   + g\\left[\\frac{q_{fn}}{e_{fn}}-\\frac{q}{e}\\right]g\\left[\\frac{q_{fn}}{e_{fn}}-\\frac{q}{e}\\right]g   + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\ , \\label{eq : gfng}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the difference @xmath89 ( being @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 the corresponding finite nucleus and nuclear matter pauli operators and energy denominators ) accounts for the relevant intermediate particle - particle states .",
    "this difference has been shown to be quite small @xcite and , therefore , in all practical calculations @xmath87 can be well approximated by truncating the expansion ( [ eq : gfng ] ) up second order in the nuclear matter @xmath25-matrix .",
