    "the observation of cosmic rays with energies in excess of @xmath2 present a major challenge to astro - particle physics . due to the presence of cosmic microwave background radiation",
    "it is predicted that cosmic rays with energies above @xmath2 will not be observed due to the gzk cut - off @xcite .",
    "the presence of gzk violating events implies new physics unless the source of these events lie within our astrophysical neighbourhood .",
    "some interesting possibilities include topological defects @xcite , primordial black holes @xcite or super heavy particles @xcite decaying within a distance of about 100 mpc in order to evade the gzk bound .",
    "however most of such topdown scenarios are severely constrained by existing data .",
    "there also exist many proposals which solve the cosmological propagation problem by introducing new physics .",
    "examples include violations of lorentz invariance @xcite , existence of susy particles @xcite , existence of magnetic monopoles @xcite , z - burst @xcite , a strongly interacting neutrino at ultra high energies(uhe ) @xcite etc .",
    "many of these proposals are also severely constrained by existing experiments and will be further tested by future planned experiments . the strongly interacting neutrino proposal , for example , will be ruled out by non - observation of uhe neutrinos in experiments by the year 2006 @xcite .",
    "the only possible conventional astrophysical sources for uhe neutrinos are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "these can be considered as possible sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) only if we assume that the propagation problem is solved by some new physics proposal .",
    "it is clearly important to consider alternate sources of uhecr , even if they are located at cosmological distances .",
    "here we consider primordial black holes decaying in the early universe .",
    "these objects are interesting because , depending on their masses , they can survive till today .",
    "uhecrs from primordial black holes(pbh ) in our astrophysical neighbourhood have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the production of uhe protons and neutrinos from pbhs decaying today and also pbhs which decay in early epoch of the cosmological evolution of the universe .",
    "we calculate uhe fluxes in standard 4d pbhs as well as in 5d braneworld pbhs . in the next two sections we review the 4d pbhs and 5d brane world pbhs .",
    "it is known that black holes would have formed in very early universe through density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations may either be primordial or may be formed spontaneously at any epoch .",
    "pbhs might have formed at any spontaneous symmetry breaking epoch through the collision of bubbles @xcite or through the collapse of cosmic strings @xcite . if one assumes the production of black hole with mass of the order of horizon mass at some time @xmath3 in the evolution of universe then its mass @xcite , @xmath4 such a black hole with mass of order",

    "similarly characteristic time required to produce particles with planck energy @xmath27 is of the order of @xmath28 sec .",
    "hence duration of the emission of these high energy particles by pbhs is unimportant compared to the evolution time of the universe . after integrating eq .",
    "[ loss ] , the mass of the black hole , at any time @xmath3 , is approximately given by @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 are respectively the initial mass of the pbhs , age of the universe and mass of the pbhs evaporating today .",
    "the standard model provides a lower bound on the high energy value of @xmath20 , above top production threshold .",
    "one can assume same value of @xmath20 to hold at higher energies .",

    "braneworld cosmological models provide an interesting alternative to the standard cosmology . in this scenario pbhs",
    "can be formed in very early universe by density perturbation @xcite . in the well known rs2 model",
    "our universe is a positive tension brane in a 5d bulk with @xmath31 type of compactification .",

    "we assume similar mass function for 5d brane world pbhs .",

    "the neutrinos may be emitted directly by the pbh , which we refer to as the direct flux .",
    "alternatively they may be emitted by hadrons and other particles in the pbh spectrum .",
    "we refer to this as the indirect flux .",
    "let @xmath83 represent the direct neutrino flux at energy @xmath84 given in eq . [ hawking ] ,",

    "for pbhs of mass @xmath128 and @xmath129 neutrino flux at @xmath2 is very small compared to neutrino flux limit because the number of uhe particles emitted by low mass black holes decrease rapidly as their mass decreases .",

    "we observe that neutrino fluxes are much smaller compared to 4d pbhs even considering maximum allowed pbh densities at their corresponding evaporation era .",
    "this is understandable because the temperature of 5d pbhs is small compared to the 4d pbhs of same mass .",

    "<S> origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays is an unsolved problem . </S>",
    "<S> several proposals such as z - burst , decay of super massive matter , susy particles as a primary , neutrino as a primary in extra dimension models exist in the literature which try to address this issue . </S>",
    "<S> many of these proposals solve the problem of propagation of cosmic rays over cosmological distances by introducing new physics . </S>",
    "<S> however these do not explain the origin of such high energy cosmic rays . </S>",
    "<S> the possible astrophysics sites , such as active galactic nuclei , are highly constrained . here </S>",
    "<S> we determine whether these cosmic rays originated from the decay of some exotic objects , such as primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , present in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the usual top down scenario we do not assume that this exotic object necessarily has to decay in our astrophysical neighbourhood since we assume a beyond the standard model scenario , where the propagation problem is absent . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the standard 4-dimension pbhs as well as the brane world pbhs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in both cases it is unable to produce the observed ultra high energy cosmic ray flux .    </S>",
