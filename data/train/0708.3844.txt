    "since the seminal results by coleman @xcite , which can be viewed as an extension of langer s theory of homogeneous nucleation ( hn ) @xcite in condensed matter systems to relativistic field theories , there has been a large amount of work dedicated to vacuum decay at both zero and , inspired by linde s work @xcite , finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "several textbooks and review articles describe the topic in detail @xcite .    in high energy physics ,",
    "the interest in false vacuum decay comes from the fact that models describing the fundamental interactions of matter fields often possess metastable states .",
    "for instance , it is still unclear if the quark - hadron transition is or not at least weakly first order @xcite . within models of electroweak symmetry breaking , several extensions of the standard model , supersymmetric or not , support metastable states @xcite .",
    "it is hoped by many that results from the large hadron collider will shed light on this issue , as they may reveal the fundamental mechanism of mass generation .",
    "as we move toward the early universe , many models of inflation , including the original old inflation and many others , make use of potentials with metastable states @xcite .",
    "the same is true of grand unified theories .",
    "it is thus of great interest to examine under what conditions the predictions from hn theory , which are widely used in the literature , can be trusted . in this work",
    ", we will explore the mechanisms by which a false vacuum can decay . as we hope to convince the reader ,",
    "the effective decay rate is sensitive to the properties of the initial state : the mechanism of false vacuum decay reflects its previous history .",
    "thus , having information about the decay mechanism may help us reconstruct the conditions prevalent at an earlier epoch , when the system under study was still in its metastable state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce our model and review basic results from false vacuum decay theory .",
    "we also briefly review the properties of oscillons , long - lived , time - dependent nonperturbative field configurations , as they play a key role in the present work .",
    "we complete the section describing the hartree effective potential and the details of our @xmath0 lattice implementation . in section iii , we explore the different mechanisms of vacuum decay , emphasizing the departures from hn .",
    "we describe in detail how a power - law decay rate is operative for a wide range of parameters controlling the properties of the initial state and the field interactions .",
    "we construct a phase diagram encompassing the three roads toward vacuum decay : hn , resonant nucleation , characterized by power - law decay , and fast cross over .",
    "we conclude in section iv , with a summary of our results and possible applications .",
    "we include an appendix , describing how to obtain analytically the scaling factor controlling the dependence of the results on lattice spacing .",
    "we are interested in ( d+1)-dimensional scalar field theories with conservative dynamics defined by the hamiltonian    [ hamiltonian ] h [ ] = d^dx \\ { ( _ t ) ^2 + ( _ i)^2 + v ( ) }  ,    where the tree - level potential energy density is written for convenience as [ pot ] v()=^2-^3+^4  .",
    "we use units where @xmath1 .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are positive - definite and temperature independent . with the rescaling , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the potential can be written as @xmath6 , with    [ respot ] v()=-+  ,    while the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "we use a finite - temperature description merely for its convenience in setting the properties of the initial state , which we will take to be a state of thermal equilibrium prepared in the potential above with @xmath8 .",
    "but before we describe our procedure , it is convenient to briefly review some relevant results from hn .",
    "consider a model with an asymmetric double - well potential , such as the one of eq .",
    "[ respot ] with @xmath17 .",
    "the field is initially in thermal equilibrium with only small - amplitude fluctuations about the metastable minimum at @xmath18 .",
    "one then computes the free energy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the partition function , given by the path integral @xmath21\\exp[-f[\\p]/t]$ ] . at finite temperature ,",
    "@xmath22 $ ] is the euclidean free - energy functional of the configuration @xmath23 , which may contain temperature and quantum corrections to the tree - level theory defined in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] .",
    "to lowest order in perturbation theory , these corrections are included in the effective potential . at @xmath24",
    ", one should use the @xmath25-dimensional euclidean effective action @xmath26 $ ] , as opposed to @xmath22/t$ ] , in the exponent @xcite .",
    "the calculation proceeds as follows : first , one identifies the stationary points of @xmath22 $ ] , given by the solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "there are two for generic asymmetric double - well potentials , such as the ones in figure [ potential ] : the false vacuum at @xmath27 , and the spherically - symmetric bounce or critical bubble @xmath28 , found by solving [ bounceeq1 ] _",
    "r^2 + _ r =  , where @xmath29 is the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the solution must satisfy the boundary conditions , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "second , adopting the semi - classical approximation where the path integral is dominated by small fluctuations about the classical paths , one sums over _ quadratic _ fluctuations about the stationary points of the free energy using the saddle - point approximation to the gaussian path integral .",
    "the calculation is completed by summing over the contribution from many bubbles , which makes use of the `` dilute gas '' approximation , where the nucleating bubbles are assumed to be far enough away from each other so as not to overlap , being thus treated as independent events .",
    "the end result , the probability per volume per unit time of nucleating a bubble of `` true '' vacuum within the false vacuum background for a system at temperature @xmath33 is , [ decayrate ] ~t^(d+1 )  .",
    "the quotes are a reminder that the nucleating bubbles are not initially at the true vacuum , only close to it ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the sums over bubbles and over quadratic fluctuations about the stationary points give rise to a prefactor which can be roughly approximated by @xmath35 or , in quantum tunneling , by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the relevant mass scale . here",
    ", we will be mainly interested in the exponential factor which , in most scenarios , dominates the false vacuum decay rate .",
    "summarizing , the calculation of false vacuum decay in hn relies on two key assumptions : small ( quadratic ) fluctuations about the false vacuum and about the critical bubble , and the dilute gas approximation .",
    "although the equation describing the critical bubble , eq .",
    "[ bounceeq1 ] , does not , in general , have exact solutions , an estimate of the energy of a critical bubble can be obtained in the `` thin wall '' approximation @xcite .",
    "essentially , when the potential @xmath11 is nearly degenerate , the critical bubble will have a spatial extension , or `` radius , '' @xmath38 much larger than the thickness of the wall separating its interior from its exterior , defined as the region where @xmath23 changes abruptly from @xmath39 at @xmath40 to @xmath27 at @xmath41 .",
    "there are thus two main contributions to the free energy ( or euclidean action ) of the critical bubble : the wall ( @xmath42 , and the interior of the bubble ( @xmath43 ) , where one writes @xmath44 .",
    "the approximate expression for the bubble energy is ,    e_twc_d r^d-1 \\ { - |v| } ,    where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is related to the volume of a @xmath29-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "also , @xmath49 $ ] is the surface tension .",
    "minimizing with respect to @xmath47 gives :    [ twr ] r_b= , and the nucleation energy - barrier in the thin wall approximation is ,    [ twe ] e_tw = c_d .    within the thin - wall approximation",
    ", the bounce solution may be approximately parameterized by @xmath50 . using a scaling argument",
    ", we can rewrite the surface tension as @xmath51 , which allows us to integrate @xmath52 to obtain _",
    "r_b1 = _ + ^23 .",
    "the volume contribution from the potential is only a function of the asymmetry @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath54 , where @xmath55 in the thin wall approximation .",
    "then , expanding the expressions for the energy , eq .",
    "[ twe ] , and the radius , eq . [ twr ] , about @xmath56 , we can obtain approximate analytical expressions for both as follows :    e_tw ( 1 ^d-1 + d+3^d-2 ) + o(^3-d ) , [ dbounce ]    r_b ( 1 + 1 - 7 ) .",
    "although these expressions breakdown quite quickly as @xmath57 increases , they provide the dominant scaling of energy and radius with the coupling @xmath15 .      alongside with the critical bubble or bounce",
    ", oscillons will play a key role in the mechanism for fast vacuum decay .",
    "in fact , the title of this work alludes to their presence in the metastable minimum and their effect on the decay rate . as such , it is useful to briefly review their properties . in their simplest form ,",
    "oscillons are spatially - extended , very long - lived , time - dependent solutions of the nonlinear klein - gordon equation @xcite , or of other pdes with amplitude - dependent nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "their properties have been extensively studied during the past decade in two @xcite , three @xcite , and higher @xcite spatial dimensions , and , more recently , in u(1 ) abelian - higgs models @xcite and in su(2)xu(1 ) models @xcite .",
    "however , it is fair to say that a more fundamental understanding of their existence and longevity is still lacking .    in the context of relativistic scalar field models ,",
    "oscillons are characterized by large - amplitude oscillations about the vacuum state .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , it has been shown @xcite that they only exist if these fluctuations probe beyond the inflection point [ @xmath58 of @xmath11 , although they may be more general @xcite .",
    "the reader may consult the references cited for more details .",
    "scalar field oscillons have been found by two methods . the first , and simpler",
    ", method makes use of an initial condition @xmath59 that resembles the oscillon solution , for example , @xmath60 $ ] , for @xmath11 of eq .",

    ", the field will evolve into the oscillon configuration , where it will remain for a lifetime that is sensitive to the values of @xmath63 , and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath64 can be estimated analytically for degenerate and non - degenerate polynomial potentials for an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "the second method , more general , shows that oscillons emerge , under very general conditions , when large - amplitude fluctuations about a given vacuum state with sufficient thermal ( or quantum noise ) are present . in the context of @xmath65 models , gleiser and",
    "howell showed that they emerge after a quench from a single - well to a double - well potential @xcite . in the model of eq .",
    "[ respot ] this would correspond to a change from @xmath8 to @xmath66 .",
    "inspecting figure [ potential ] , one can see qualitatively that the quench induces coherent oscillations of the field s zero mode , @xmath67 about the metastable minimum at @xmath13 due to a `` widening '' of the potential there .",
    "other mechanisms may induce large - amplitude oscillations of the zero - mode , producing similar results .",
    "this happens , for example , in the context of reheating in certain models of cosmological inflation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is a symmetry - breaking interaction that changes the shape of the potential from single to double - well , as in the case of the quench above , or one that simply `` widens '' the curvature of the potential about the vacuum .",
    "quantitatively , the energy from these coherent oscillations is transfered to higher @xmath68 modes via parametric amplification and trigger the emergence of oscillons .",
    "we refer the reader to reference @xcite for details .",
    "not surprisingly , the same behavior ensues in @xmath0 : a quench induces oscillations of the field s zero mode , as can be seen in figure [ symave ] .",

    "]          as mentioned above , the initial state is prepared as a thermal state centered at @xmath13 in the potential of eq .",
    "[ respot ] with @xmath8 .",
    "the thermal fluctuations will induce changes in the potential for @xmath23 , which , in leading order in perturbation theory , may be approximated by the homogeneous hartree approximation ( hha ) .",
    "an excellent account of the hha , using successive truncations within the hierarchy of correlation functions to obtain corrected equations of motion , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hha assumes that the fluctuations of the field and its associated momentum remain gaussian throughout its evolution .",
    "thus , the approximation works well just prior and just after the quench for all temperatures , and for low temperatures at all times .",
    "the hartree potential can be derived as follows : write the field as @xmath74 .",

    "one can clearly distinguish two populations of modes : low-@xmath68 , oscillon - related modes far from equilibrium ( for @xmath93 ) , and modes that remain in thermal equilibrium for all times ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "we have presented a detailed numerical study of the decay of metastable vacua in scalar field theories . in particular , we investigated the effects of large - amplitude fluctuations about the vacuum state on the decay rate .",
    "these large - amplitude fluctuations were produced by a rapid quench from a single to an asymmetric double well potential . we have argued that they are characterized by spatially - extended , long - lived oscillatory configurations called oscillons .",
    "there are , of course , short - lived , small - amplitude configurations as well , but those play a small role on the dynamics of vacuum decay . they are incorporated , via a perturbative approach , into the effective hartree potential .",
    "our main result was to obtain a phase diagram characterizing the three possible mechanisms for vacuum decay .",
    "two of them , slow homogeneous nucleation and rapid cross - over , are well known .",
    "homogeneous nucleation ensues when fluctuations about the metastable vacuum are small - amplitude , within the perturbative regime .",
    "cross - over ensues when fluctuations are very large - amplitude , probing well beyond the inflection point of the effective potential .",
    "the novel mechanism , resonant nucleation , lies between these two and ensues when fluctuations probe the neighborhood of the inflection point .",
    "we have shown that , as in @xmath65 @xcite , @xmath0 resonant nucleation is characterized by a power - law decay rate , @xmath180 , where @xmath127 is the energy of the critical bubble computed with the effective potential , @xmath95 is the effective lattice temperature , and @xmath181 is the exponent controlling the decay .",
    "we argued that resonant nucleation typically occurs when two oscillons coalesce to form a critical bubble or , marginally , when a single oscillon becomes unstable to growth .",
    "although the coalescence of three or more oscillons is possible , this process tends to be highly suppressed due to its long time - scale .",
    "our results open many avenues for future investigation .",
    "can oscillons play a role in inflationary cosmology ? during reheating , the inflaton undergoes damped , large - amplitude oscillations about the potential minimum .",
    "this is essentially the same mechanism that gives rise to oscillons . of course",
    ", one must add the effects of the cosmic expansion , but preliminary results in simple @xmath182 models indicate that oscillons not only will be present but will actually be stabilized by the expansion , becoming spikes in the energy - density distribution @xcite .",
    "we are currently investigating such possibility in a full @xmath0 simulation .",
    "another area where the effects of oscillons should be further investigated is during spontaneous symmetry breaking . in the present work",
    ", we investigated a simple @xmath9 symmetry breaking , as we quenched from a single to an asymmetric double well potential .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics of symmetry breaking is very sensitive to the model parameters and that oscillons can play a key role . in a related work",
    ", we found that low - momentum vortex - antivortex scattering in broken u(1 ) gauge models can lead to very long - lived oscillons characterized by a ( practically ) non - radiating oscillating magnetic dipole and nontrivial chern - simons number @xcite .",
    "et al . _ and graham @xcite found a long - lived oscillon in broken su(2)xu(1 ) models when the higgs mass is twice the @xmath183 mass .",
    "if this turns out to be the right mass ratio , as hopefully we will soon know from the lhc , we should expect electroweak oscillons to exist in nature .",
    "alternatively , they may exist even for a wider range of values .",
    "taken together , these results demonstrate the rich physics of time - dependent , spatially - extended field configurations .",
    "this richness is only beginning to be explored .",

    "consider the simple case of a quadratic potential @xmath184 , for which the hartree potential is simple @xmath185 .",
    "consider also the 1-loop potential with uv cutoff @xmath85 , v_1l()=v_0 + t 2_0^d^dpln(p^2 + v_0  ) . in @xmath116 the integral gives , v_1l()= v_0 + v_0 \\{1 - ( ) } , while in @xmath106 we obtain v_1l()= v_0 + \\ { 3 v_0 - ( v_0)^3/2 } .",
