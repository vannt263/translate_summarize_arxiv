    "one of the most challenging issues of modern physics is the possible existence of the extra - dimensions of the space - time continuum .",
    "multi - dimensional geometries are the natural framework for the modern string / m theories @xcite or brane models @xcite .",
    "string models also provide a natural and self - consistent explanation for the possible variation of the fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "hence the problem of the extra - dimensions of the space - time continuum is closely related to the problem of the variations of the fundamental constants , like , for example the fine structure constant @xmath1 or the speed of light @xmath2 .",
    "most of the multi - dimensional theories contain a built - in mechanism , which allows the variation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the speed of propagation of particles in vacuum is modified due to the supplementary effects induced by the extra - dimensions .",
    "the confirmation that at least some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are indeed at cosmological distances raises the possibility that observations of these could provide interesting constraints on the fundamental laws of physics .",
    "the study of short - duration photon bursts , propagating over cosmological distances , is the most promising way to probe the effects related to the existence of extra - dimensions and quantum gravity effects .",
    "data on grbs may be used to set limits on variations in the velocity of light .",
    "this has been illustrated , by using batse and osse observations of the grbs that have recently been identified optically , and for which precise redshifts are available , in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the effects of the existence of the extra - dimensions on the propagation of high energy photons .",
    "based on the expressions for the photon time delay we suggest that the detection of the 18-gev photon @xmath34500 s after the kev / mev burst in grb 940217 provides a strong evidence for the existence of a multi - dimensional universe .    the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the main physical mechanisms for tev photon emission from grb s .",
    "the time delay of photons in multi - dimensional cosmological models is considered in section iii .",
    "we discuss and conclude our results in section iv .",
    "the mechanisms for tev photon production in grbs have been reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "one such mechanism is the electron inverse compton emission in grb shocks , with an energy spectrum that can be commonly described as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . on the other hand , in the reverse shocks",
    "the tev spectrum is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "similar to the electrons , protons can also be accelerated up to ultra - high energies higher than @xmath8 ev @xcite , producing a spectrum characteristic of fermi mechanism @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the energy of the proton .",
    "these protons , accelerated in both internal and external shocks can produce gamma rays with energies of the order of tev @xcite .",
    "the protons can be accelerated up to @xmath11 ev for @xmath12 and therefore the energy of the synchrotron photons can extend to the tev band for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the shock energy carried out by the magnetic field and @xmath15 is the number density of the external medium .",

    "tev gamma rays emitted from extra - galactic sources may collide with diffuse cosmic infrared background photons , leading to secondary @xmath18 electron - positron pairs .",

    ", @xmath19 also depends on the evolution of the cosmic infrared background with the redshift .    for tev @xmath20-photons",
    "the pair production cross section is maximized when the soft photon energy @xmath21 is in the infrared range . for a @xmath22 tev gamma ray",
    "this corresponds to a soft photon wavelength near the k - band ( @xmath23 @xmath24 m ) .",
    "thus , infrared photons with wavelengths around @xmath25 @xmath24 m will contribute most to the absorption of tev gamma rays .",
    "absorption of @xmath20-rays of energies below @xmath26 gev is negligible @xcite .    in order to estimate the number of high - energy photons from a gamma - ray burst",
    "we assume that the source gives a continuous spectrum , from kev to tev photons .",
    "the fluence ( the energy per unit area ) @xmath27 can be represented , as a function of the photon energy @xmath28 , in the general form @xmath29 , where we assume that @xmath30 is a ( model dependent ) constant .",
    "the proportionality constant can be obtained from the observational result that the observed fluence , for @xmath31 kev , is of the order of @xmath32 erg @xmath33 .",

    "after the low - energy emission has ended , an @xmath76 gev energy photon and 36 photons with 137 mev energy have been recorded , after @xmath805400 s following the low energy emission .",
    "assuming that the photon originated at @xmath81 and taking @xmath82 s , where we have also included the uncertainty in the moment of photon emission during the burst , we obtain for the linear energy scale the value @xmath83 .",

    "the delay of the @xmath76 gev photon fixes the corresponding energy scales .",
    "the remarkable concordance between the linear quantum gravity / extra - dimensional energy scale obtained from the present study of the time delay of the @xmath76 gev photon in grb 940217 and from the independent study of the batse and osse data @xcite strongly suggest that this time delay could be the signature of the extra - dimensions or / and quantum gravitational effects .",
    "there are several proposed , satellite based grb research projects .",
    "swift , a multi - wavelength grb observatory will be launched in early 2004 .",
    "it has the optimum capabilities in determining the origin of grbs and their afterglows , providing redshifts for the bursts and multi - wavelength light curves .",
    "a wide - field gamma - ray camera will detect approximately 1000 grbs in 3 years with a sensitivity 5 times fainter than the batse detector aboard compton gro .",
    "sensitive narrow - field x - ray and uv / optical telescopes will be pointed at the burst location in 20 to 70 seconds by an autonomously controlled `` swift '' spacecraft .",
    "swift will acquire high - precision locations for gamma ray bursts and will rapidly relay a 1 - 4 arc - minute position estimate to the ground within 15 seconds ( http://swift .",
    "gov , 2003 ) .",
    "another satellite based experiment , the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) , a high energy ( @xmath88 mev-@xmath89 gev ) gamma - ray astronomy mission , is planned for launch at the end of 2006 @xcite .",
    "glast should detect more than 200 grbs per year , with sensitivity to a few tens of gev for a few bursts .",
    "glast could also detect the energy- and distance - dependent dispersion of ( @xmath49 ms / gev / gpc ) , predicted by quantum gravity and multi - dimensional models within 1 - 2 years of observations @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the very high energy component of the gamma - ray bursts might be delayed makes the detection with the sensitive ground based atmospheric telescopes more feasible .",
    "the time delay between the registration of the mev burst and its notification to the ground - based observer can be as little as ten seconds .",
    "the slew times for the large telescopes varies from 20 seconds to 5 minutes , but can be much less if the observing target for the telescope happens to be close to the gamma ray source direction . in principle",
    "the telescope can continue to monitor the source position for up to eight hours ( depending on its elevation and the position of sun and moon ) and on succeeding nights .",
    "the sensitivity that can be achieved is , for the current whipple 10 m telescope of the order of @xmath90 ergs/@xmath40 for a duration of the burst of @xmath22 and @xmath49 seconds , and of @xmath91 ergs/@xmath40 for a 100 s duration burst .",
    "for the proposed veritas array of telescopes @xcite the minimum fluence is @xmath92 ergs/@xmath40 for @xmath22 and @xmath49 second bursts and @xmath93 ergs/@xmath40 for @xmath94 s bursts .",
    "these data can be regarded as representative of the present generation of operating telescopes and for those that will come on - line the next few years ( cangaroo iii , hess , magic and veritas ) .",
    "delayed gamma - ray bursts will be also dispersed , since the velocity of light is a function of energy ; hence the energy resolution of the detectors will be critical .",
    "the minimum detectable fluence is limited by the duration of the burst .",
    "for short times the fluence is limited by the number of photons , since there is virtually no background @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of the time delay between tev and gev / mev photons from grbs could represent a new possibility for the study and understanding of some fundamental aspects of the physical laws governing our universe ."
