    "entanglement has been used in many different protocols of quantum information theory , from teleportation and key distribution to secret sharing @xcite . in all these protocols , entanglement is a resource which is completely consumed by measurements of the parties involved and should be generated anew for next rounds of protocol .",
    "it is true that generating and maintaining entanglement between several particles is very difficult . yet with the developments in realizing quantum repeaters @xcite ,",
    "creating and maintaining long distance entanglement between stationary quantum systems becomes more feasible in the ( possibly distant ) future .",
    "it is thus rewarding to imagine if this entanglement can used in a different way , that is as a carrier of information , which modulates and transmits quantum information , in the same way as carrier waves in classical communication systems carry modulated messages . in this new application",
    ", we can imagine that arbitrary quantum states are uploaded ( entangled ) to the carrier by the sender and downloaded ( disentangled ) from the carrier by the receiver(s ) , in such a way that at the end of the protocol , the carrier remains intact and ready for use in next rounds .",
    "the role of the quantum carrier and its entanglement with the messages will be to hide messages from adversaries , hence the term secure quantum carrier .",
    "+ this new way for using entanglement was first reported in @xcite for quantum key distribution and then was developed for a simple secret sharing scheme in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we want to develop it further and provide quantum carriers for secret sharing schemes for general threshold schemes @xcite .",
    "needless to say , our aim is not to develop new quantum secret sharing schemes , but to develop a quantum carrier for distributing in a secure way the already known quantum secrets among the parties . our emphasis is thus on the very concept of secure quantum carrier and the way it can be used in quantum communication protocols . in the particular context of quantum secret sharing , as we will see it allows us to generate broader threshold schemes than those of @xcite . + in particular we have to stress the difference with the works in @xcite where it was shown that graph state formalism @xcite can act as a framework for unifying some of the secret sharing protocols , albeit not for general threshold structures . the idea of @xcite was to encode the secret in some local actions of the dealer on a vertex of a suitably chosen weighted graph state .",
    "local measurements of the players on different vertices of this graph , could then reveal the secret to authorized subsets of players . in this way",
    ", it was shown that threshold schemes of the type @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be implemented in a unified way for various forms of channels interconnecting the dealer and the players .",
    "therefore the works of @xcite belong to the same class as in @xcite , in which entanglement is fully consumed due to measurements of the players .",
    "+ it is to be noted that while the idea of a fixed quantum carrier has an appeal for communication , a price should be paid for its implementation : it requires a larger number of particles to be entangled at the beginning and end of the protocol , but at the end of each round a fixed amount of entanglement remains in the form of a carrier .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to develop such a concept from theoretical side and hope that it will someday become close to reality .",
    "+ we remark that although we present our analysis for secure communication of basis states or classical information , the idea also works for sending arbitrary quantum states . in the simplest protocol discussed in the beginning of the paper",
    "we explicitly show this , although we will not repeat it for other general schemes .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ general ]",
    "we put forward the basic requirements that a quantum carrier should satisfy , in section [ keycarrier ] we explain the basic method in the simplest possible setting , that is quantum key distribution between two parties .",
    "then in section [ bkcarrier ] we briefly explain the use of quantum carrier for the simplest secret sharing scheme , where one dealer , wants to share a secret between two different players who have equal right for retrieving the message collaboratively . for this reason ,",
    "this is called a @xmath3 secret shring scheme .",
    "this is then generalized to the @xmath4 scheme where a secret is to be shared between @xmath0 players and all the @xmath0 players can retrieve the message collaboratively .",
    "finally in section [ kncarrier ] we define the carrier for the @xmath5 threshold scheme where any of the @xmath6 players can retrieve the secret , although collaboration of all of the players is needed for the continuous running and security of the protocol .",
    "we end the paper with conclusion and outlook .",
    "suppose that a quantum carrier has been set up for a specific communication task , i.e. for a quantum key distribution between alice and bob or a secret sharing scheme , between alice as the dealer and bob and charlie as the players .",
    "this quantum carrier should have the following properties :    * there should be simple and local uploading and downloading operators , so that the legitimate parties can upload and download messages to or from this carrier . *",
    "while in transit , the messages should be hidden from third parties so that no intercept - resend strategy can reveal the identity of the message .",
    "* eve should not be able to entangle herself to the quantum carrier without being detected by the legitimate parties .",
    "this property is to prevent eve from conducting more complex attacks .",
    "once such criteria are met , we say that a secure quantum carrier has been set up for this communication task . in the rest of this paper we present quantum carriers for various communication tasks .",
    "we should stress again that these requirements are purely from the theoretical point of view , the main difficulty will obviously be to maintain the carrier for a long enough time so that it can be used for passing many quantum states before the entanglement decays and becomes useless .",
    "the first task that we discuss is the simple communication between two parties , where alice wants to send a sequence of bits @xmath7 and @xmath8 , a classical message , to bob @xcite .",
    "alice encodes the classical bits @xmath7 and @xmath8 into states @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the eigenbases of the @xmath11 operator ) .",
    "the quantum carrier is @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the hilbert spaces of alice and bob respectively .",
    "the hilbert space of the message is denoted by a number @xmath8 ( since one qubit is being transmitted ) .",
    "the uploading operator , used by alice , is a cnot operator which we denote by @xmath14 , @xmath15 the downloading operator is @xmath16 , i.e. with control port by bob and target port the message .",
    "+ consider now a classical bit @xmath17 which is encoded to the quantum state @xmath18 and is to be transferred from alice to bob .",
    "alice performs the local operation @xmath14 on the state @xmath19 , turning this state into @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "while in transit the message is in the state @xmath22 and hence inaccessible to eve . at the destination",
    ", bob can download the message from the carrier by his local operation @xmath16 , which disentangles the message and leaves the carrier in its original form , ready for use in the next round .",
    "the fact that bob downloads exactly the same state which has been uploaded by alice is due to the perfect correlation of the states of alice and bob in the carrier .",
    "alice can also use this carrier for sending quantum states to bob .",
    "linearity of the uploading and downloading operations allows alice and bob to entangle and disentangle a quantum state @xmath23 to and from the carrier .",
    "+ to conduct a somewhat complex attacks on the communication , eve can entangle herself to the carrier and try to intercept - recend the message .",
    "to do this the only possibility for her entanglement is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two un - normalized states of eve s ancilla .",
    "any other form of entanglement , i.e. one in which a term like @xmath27 is also present in the above expansion , will destroy the perfect correlation between the sequence of bits transmitted between alice and bob . in case that the two parties are using the carrier for sending classical bits , alice and bob",
    "can publicly compare a subsequence of bits to detect the presence of eve s entanglement . in case that they are using the carrier for sending quantum states ,",
    "alice can insert a random subsequence of basis states into the main stream of states and ask bob to publicly announce his results of measurements of these specific states .",
    "this strategy also works in other more complicated schemes presented later , namely the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 schemes .",
    "+ in order to prevent this type of entanglement , we now use a property of the carrier ( [ ( 1,1)carrier ] ) which turns out to be important in all the other forms of quantum carriers that we will introduce later on .",
    "this is the invariance property of the carrier ( [ ( 1,1)carrier ] ) under hadamard operations , that is @xmath28 at the end of each round , when the message is downloaded and the carrier is clean , both alice and bob act on their share of the carrier by hadamard operations . in the absence of eve",
    ", the carrier will remain the same , however in presence of eve , ( who supposedly acts on her ancilla by a unitary @xmath29 ) the _ contaminated _ ( entangled with the ancialla of eve ) carrier ( [ ( 1,1)carrier ] ) will turn out to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the second term in the carrier will certainly introduce anti - correlations into the basis states communicated between alice and bob , unless @xmath33 and hence @xmath34 which means that eve can not entangle herself to the carrier .",
    "in this scheme , alice wants to share a secret with bob and charlie so that they can retrieve the message only by their collaboration .",
    "the first quantum protocol for this scheme was designed in @xcite where it was shown that measurements of a ghz state in random bases by the three parties can enable them to share a random secret key .",
    "the secure carrier for this protocol was first developed in @xcite .",
    "its characteristic feature is that two types of carriers , should be used which are turned into each other by the hadamard operations .",
    "the two carriers are @xmath35 used in the odd rounds 1 , 3 , 5 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 used in the even rounds , 2 , 4 , 6 , @xmath38 the two types of carriers are turned into each other by the local hadamard action of the players at the end of each round , @xmath39 this property is crucial in checking the security of the protocol and detection of a eve attempts who may entangle herself with the carrier and intercept the secret bits . + in the odd and even rounds ,",
    "the secret bit @xmath17 is encoded differently as @xmath40 where @xmath41 . while in the odd rounds , the receivers each receive a copy of the sent bit , in the even rounds they need each other collaboration for its retrieval .",
    "therefore alice can use the odd rounds to put random stray bits and put the message bits in the even rounds . + in our opinion this property of the protocol , that is , a rate of one - half in sending message bits is analogous to discarding one - half of the measured bits in measurement - based protocols .",
    "however the bonus here is that alice can send pre - determined non - random messages .",
    "+ note that in both even and odd rounds the carrier can be written as @xmath42 where we have dropped the subscripts even and odd to stress the uniformity .",
    "the running of the protocol , i.e. the uploading and downloading operations , are based on the following readily verifiable identities which we state for odd and even rounds separately without writing the subscripts `` odd '' and `` even '' explicitly : + for odd rounds : @xmath43 , [ identitiesodd ] and [ identitieseven ] ) show how the encoded secret can be downloaded by alice and downloaded by bob and charlie in different rounds . in the odd rounds , the uploading operator is simply @xmath44 , and in the even rounds it is @xmath14 . in both types of rounds",
    "the downloading operator is @xmath45 .",
    "these string of operators , that is , uploading , carrying and downloading is depicted as follows :    @xmath46    the above equation shows that any state @xmath47 can be encoded as @xmath48 and transferred by the same operations .",
    "so this protocol can also be used for quantum state sharing in a secure way .",
    "the problems of security of the carriers and the impossibility of eve s entanglement with them , has been analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main points are that i ) the secret state is transferred from alice to bob and charlie in a mixed state and hence carries no information to outsiders , and ii ) the carriers in even and odd rounds are turned into each other by local hadamard actions of alice , bob and charlie , a property which is possible only in the absence of any entanglement with eve .",
    "any entanglement will have a detectable trace on a substring of transferred states , which will be used to detect the presence of eve @xcite .",
    "the previous protocol can be generalized to the @xmath4 scheme , where all the @xmath0 players should retrieve the secret collaboratively . in this case",
    "the encoding of a bit @xmath17 to quantum states for odd and even rounds is @xmath49 therefore @xmath50 is an even parity state , and @xmath51 is an odd parity state",
    ".    then the protocol runs as in the @xmath3 case with the obvious generalization of the carrier and the uploading and downloading operators .",
    "in fact in both types of rounds the carrier can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the encoding in ( [ encodingnn ] ) and we have suppressed the subscripts `` even '' and `` odd '' for simplicity .",
    "the uploading operator will be @xmath54 for the odd rounds and @xmath55 for the even rounds .",
    "the downloading operator will be the same for both rounds and will be @xmath56 .",
    "+ to show that the protocol runs in exactly the same way as in the ( 2,2 ) scheme , we need to prove the basic properties of the encoded states and the carrier . to this end , we first note from ( [ encodingnn ] ) that the following relations hold , @xmath57 and [ identitieseven ] ) to the ( n , n ) case . to this end",
    "we start from the simple properties @xmath58 to obtain @xmath59 the only other non - trivial relation which we should prove is the following relation for the even rounds which is necessary for the downloading operation , ( for the odd rounds , the involved states are product states and the relation is obvious ) : @xmath60    to show the validity of this relation we first use the following simple property of cnot operation , where the first bit is the control and the second bit is the target qubits : @xmath61 second we use these properties and ( [ encodingnn ] ) and the abbreviation @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 this completes the description and validity of the uploading and downloading procedures for the ( n , n ) scheme",
    ". + in passing we note that the form of the carrier ( [ carriern ] ) for this @xmath4 secret sharing scheme is the same as in the simplest cryptographic protocol,([(1,1)carrier ] ) .",
    "we will see in the next section that the appropriate carrier for the threshold scheme @xmath5 where @xmath0 is an odd prime , is of the same form .",
    "we will explain the reason for this general structure in the last section , however before that , we explain in detail the carrier for the @xmath5 secret sharing scheme .",
    "there are situations where there are @xmath0 players and any subset of @xmath6 or more members can retrieve the secret , while subsets of smaller size can not .",
    "this is called a @xmath5 threshold structure @xcite in which all the players have equal weight .",
    "one can also imagine situations where different players have different weights .",
    "this leads to a general access structure , according to which the players form a set @xmath64 of say @xmath0 members and an access structure is a collection @xmath65 of subsets of @xmath64 .",
    "the subsets in @xmath66 ( and their unions ) are called authorized subsets and the members of each authorized subset should be able to retrieve the key by their collaboration , while the subsets which are not in @xmath66 , called adversaries , can not retrieve the secret .",
    "it is known that once a threshold scheme is solved , then other more general access structures will be possible @xcite .",
    "for example if @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then we can run a @xmath69 threshold scheme giving 2 shares to @xmath70 and one shares to @xmath13 and @xmath71 each . +",
    "the @xmath5 threshold scheme was first generalized to the quantum domain in @xcite , where quantum states could also be shared between @xmath0 parties so that any @xmath6 of the players could retrieve the quantum state collaboratively . to be in conformity with the no - cloning theorem",
    ", @xmath0 had to be smaller than @xmath72 .",
    "we will deal in detail with the case where @xmath73 is a prime number .",
    "other cases where @xmath74 are obtained by a simple modification of the @xmath75 scheme .",
    "for example a scheme like @xmath76 is implemented by running the scheme @xmath75 as usual , but with alice playing the role of the other @xmath77 receivers in addition to her usual role .",
    "the idea of @xcite was to adapt the polynomial code , first developed in @xcite , to the quantum domain .",
    "note that in @xcite , quantum mechanics was exploited only for message splitting and not for message distribution .",
    "later it was shown in @xcite that graph states can be used for combining the two parts of the problem in one scheme , for some threshold schemes , namely for @xmath78 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 schemes . here",
    "we show that the idea of quantum carrier can be used to provide a method of secure distribution for all secrets of the @xmath5 types provided in @xcite .",
    "let us first see what a polynomial code is .",
    "consider a symbol @xmath17 .",
    "classically if we want to share this symbol as a secret between @xmath0 parties , called @xmath79 , @xmath80 , so that any @xmath6 members of the parties can retrieve this symbol and fewer than @xmath6 members can not , we can define a real polynomial of degree @xmath81 in the form @xmath82 and evaluate this polynomial on @xmath0 distinct points @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "we can then give the member @xmath85 of the set , the value @xmath86 .",
    "it is a simple fact that a polynomial of degree @xmath81 is completely determined by its values on @xmath6 distinct points .",
    "so any @xmath6 members can compare their values and determine the full functional form of the polynomial and hence the real number @xmath17 . to make the process simple and less prone to errors , we can substitute the real number field with the field @xmath87 ( where @xmath0 is prime ) . for the @xmath0 points in @xmath88",
    "we can take simply @xmath89 .",
    "hence we can encode the symbol @xmath17 into a product state @xmath90 .",
    "let us now sum such a product state over all possible @xmath91 , and obtain the code @xmath92 in order to see how to find a suitable carrier for this code , and indeed in order to show that the carrier for this code falls within the same class of carriers considered so far , we have to prove further algebraic properties of this code . to do this",
    ", we cast it in the form of a calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) code @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a prime number .",
    "with addition and multiplication modulo @xmath0 , the set @xmath93 will be a field .",
    "for any @xmath0 , @xmath94 is a a vector space over @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath94 is the set of all @xmath0-tuples @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a linear code , i.e. a subspace of @xmath98 , spanned by linearly independent vectors @xmath99 .",
    "thus @xmath97 is isomorphic to @xmath100 consider the case where the dual code of @xmath97 , i.e. the code space spanned by all the vectors which are perpendicular to @xmath97 , contains @xmath97 and has one more dimension .",
    "let @xmath101 be spanned by the vectors @xmath102 .",
    "thus we have @xmath103 in the codes that we will introduce , the special vector @xmath104 is normalized so that @xmath105 we therefore have @xmath106 we will now define the following special chalderbank - steane - shor ( css ) code @xcite , whose codewords correspond to the classes of the quotient space @xmath107 : @xmath108 thus one dit @xmath17 is coded into the @xmath0-qudit state @xmath109 which is to be distributed between the @xmath0 receivers , each component of the vector being given to one participant . + in the appendix , we will show the vectors @xmath110 with components @xmath111 satisfy all the properties listed in ( [ eiej ] ) .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath112 it is now very simple to see that the css code thus constructed is nothing but the polynomial code in ( [ encodes ] ) . to see this we note that the vector @xmath113 has the following expansion @xmath114 and",
    "hence the components will be @xmath115 therefore giving each components to one player , the code will be @xmath116 which is exactly the polynomial code ( [ poly ] ) .",
    "now that the css structure of the polynomial code is revealed , many of its properties can be proved in a simple way . in particular",
    "we need the following property which plays an important role in the security of the carrier . +",
    "* * lemma:**_the set of all @xmath5 codes ( [ codewords ] ) , is invariant under the joint multi - local hadamard operation , i.e. @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a root of unity , @xmath119 .",
    "+ _    we use a well - known property of the css codes according to which , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the number of cosets @xmath122 . to adapt this general relation to our case",
    ", we note that in our case @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and hence @xmath125 .",
    "moreover we make the following substitutions , @xmath126 and note that @xmath127 putting all this together proves the lemma .",
    "+      the quantum carrier is constructed as follows : @xmath128 the important property of this carrier is that it is invariant under the joint action of hadamard operators , performed by alice and all the other players .",
    "using ( [ hadamard ] ) proves this assertion : @xmath129 in order to see how alice uploads secrets onto the carrier and how the players download the secret from the carrier we need some algebraic properties of the code . +",
    "* definition : * for any vector @xmath130 define the following string of cnot operators performed by alice : @xmath131 also define the following multi - local operator for bob s : @xmath132    * theorem : * _ the operator @xmath133 , for @xmath134 as in ( [ ecomponents ] ) , uploads the message into the carrier by alice and the operator @xmath135 downloads the message from the carrier by bob s , leaving the carrier in its original form . _",
    "+ we fist show that for any state @xmath136 and any message @xmath137 @xmath138 this is seen by expansion of @xmath109 in components and noting that @xmath139 from ( [ proofa2 ] ) , we see that @xmath140 therefore alice uploads ( entangles ) the message @xmath109 to the carrier by the local operation @xmath141 . for the other part , we need the following @xmath142 to show this we note that @xmath143    from this last equation we find that @xmath144 which means that the players , can download the message from the carrier and put the carrier back to its original form .",
    "+ the basic steps of the quantum secret sharing are now clear .",
    "a carrier in the form of the state @xmath145 is shared between alice and all the receivers , @xmath146 .",
    "alice operates by his @xmath147 operator on her part of the carrier and the code state @xmath109 and thus entangles the code state to the carrier @xmath145 . at the destination",
    "the players act on the carrier and the code space by @xmath148 and download the state @xmath109 . from this code state ,",
    "no less than @xmath6 players can retrieve the secret symbol @xmath17 .",
    "the carrier is now ready for transferring the next code state .",
    "in this section we discuss the security of state transmission via the carrier and analyze two types of attacks performed by eve .",
    "the security of the retrieval procedure of the symbol @xmath17 from the encoded state @xmath109 need not concern us and has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "obviously the analysis of security depends on the resources available to eve .",
    "we consider two types of attacks in the following two subsections .",
    "this type of analysis applies to all the schemes mentioned up to now .      in this type of attack",
    "we assume that eve is not entangled with the carrier , but she has access to all the message qudits sent from alice to the players .",
    "after uploading the message , the full state is given by @xmath149 while in transit the data qudits are in the state @xmath150 which is an equal mixture of all the encoded states .",
    "therefore even if eve have access to all the data in transit and intercepts all the qudits sent to all the players , she can not acquire the secret @xmath17 or the secret state , since she only finds and equal mixture of all the encoded states .",
    "+ at the destination , the receivers , act by the inverse local operator @xmath151 and according to ( [ proofb3 ] ) , disentangle the code from the carrier .",
    "they can then retrieve the classical secret @xmath17 by collaboration of each other according to the access structure .",
    "once retrieved , we resort to the arguments of @xcite to show that this encoded state is secure against cheating of groups of unauthorized players . + therefore in the simplest intercept attack",
    ", eve does not acquire any information about the secret symbol @xmath17 .",
    "we now consider more general attacks .",
    "we now assume that in addition to access to the message channel , eve can entangle herself to the carrier .",
    "let us see if she can do appropriate action for intercepting the encoded state @xmath109 and not an equal mixture .",
    "consider the first round where the symbol @xmath152 is encoded to @xmath153 and sent by alice .",
    "the state of the carrier and the message after alice uploading operation will be    @xmath154    where @xmath70 stands for alice , @xmath155 for all the players @xmath156 and @xmath157 for the @xmath0 message qudits , @xmath158 .",
    "eve can now set her @xmath0 ancilla qudits @xmath159 to @xmath160 , and then do the following operations : acts by @xmath161 which transforms the state @xmath162 to @xmath163 when alice and the players execute the first round of the protocol to the end and the players extract the state @xmath164 , eve acquires nothing from the symbol @xmath152 , however she has achieved in entangling herself with the carrier in the form    @xmath165    in the second round , when the symbol @xmath166 is being sent and the full state is of the form    @xmath167    eve performs the following sequence of operations : 1 ) acts by @xmath168 to produce the state @xmath169 2 ) measures the ancillas to acquire @xmath170 , and 3 ) acts by @xmath171 to put back the full state in the form ( [ psi2 ] ) . when alice and the players finish the second round , they acquire the symbol @xmath166 , but eve also acquires the symbol @xmath170 , while she is still entangled with the carrier in the form ( [ psi1 ] ) and is ready to do the same attack for the next round . in this way she is able to retrieve the sequence of symbols",
    "@xmath172 this sequence enables her to find the whole message by checking @xmath0 different choices for the original symbol @xmath152 .",
    "this shows that if there is a possibility for eve s entanglement with the carrier , she is able to successfully intercept all the data .",
    "+ in order to prevent this , alice and the players act on their respective qudits of the carrier , by hadamard operations .",
    "as we have seen above , this operation leaves the pure form of the carrier invariant .",
    "let us see if this operation is able to detect an entanglement of eve , i.e. a contamination of the carrier .",
    "it is clear that if the carrier contains terms which are not of the form @xmath173 , then there will be mismatches between what alice uploads and what the players download .",
    "this mismatch can easily be detected by public announcements of some stray bits which are deliberately inserted into the stream of the symbols . in order to escape this detection ,",
    "the only admissible form of eve s entanglement with the carrier is @xmath174 where @xmath175 are a collection of un - normalized states of eve .",
    "the method of detection in this case is the same as in the simple @xmath3 case , discussed after equation ( [ abe ] ) .",
    "also in view of the discussion in subsection [ rollle ] , only the legitimate parties or even a subset of them are required to publicly announce the results of their measurements .",
    "+ in order to prevent this type of apparently undetectable entanglement , we note that the pure carrier is invariant under the action of hadamard operators , while this contaminated carrier is not . in order to retain the correlations",
    ", eve may operate on her ancilla by a suitable operator @xmath29 to change the above state into @xmath176 in order to retain the original form of correlations between alice and the players in the carrier , the operator @xmath29 must satisfy the following property @xmath177 for some states @xmath178 . putting @xmath179 one finds that @xmath178 is independent of @xmath180 and hence a rearrangement shows that @xmath181 acting on the left hand side by the inverse hadamard operation , one finds that @xmath182 , which means that all the states @xmath175 are equal to each other and hence the state @xmath183 can not be an entangled state .",
    "therefore eve can not entangle herself to the carrier without being detected .",
    "+ note that we have assumed that eve is an external agent and all the players have run the protocol as they should , i.e. have performed their hadamard operation on the carrier at the end of each round . in principle one can assume that a subgroup of players collaborate with eve , i.e. perform other operations than hadamard in order to ease undetectable entanglement of eve with the carrier . for example consider a @xmath78 scheme with players @xmath79 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "the question is whether one of the players , say @xmath79 is capable to collaborate with eve to retrieve the secret symbol @xmath17 ?",
    "to be honest , we have not been able neither to devise a successful attack of this type nor a method for its prevention .",
    "it is part of the protocol that all the players should perform their cnot s on the state @xmath186 in order to download the state @xmath109 , but once this state is downloaded , then no less than @xmath6 players can collaborate to retrieve the symbol @xmath17 as proved in @xcite .",
    "one may then argue that this is not a genuine @xmath5 threshold scheme , since for downloading the state @xmath109 from the carrier , all the players should collaborate .",
    "+ the important point is that the cnot operation of all the players are needed only for cleaning of the carrier from remnants of messages , and in fact any @xmath6 players can retrieve the symbol @xmath17 from the state that they download from the carrier , but the running of the protocol for other rounds , needs collaboration of all the players . +",
    "this assertion can be proved as follows : let @xmath187 be any set of @xmath6 members who want to retrieve the message .",
    "denote by @xmath188 the joint cnot operations of the @xmath6 players belonging to the set @xmath187 , i.e. _ * k*:=_jkc_b_j , jdenote also by @xmath189 the joint cnot operations of the rest of @xmath190 players .",
    "also denote by @xmath191 , the local operation and classical communications that the @xmath6 players perform among themselves to recover the symbol @xmath17 from @xmath109 .",
    "we have shown that the sequence of operations @xmath192 when acting on the state @xmath186 in ( [ psi  ] ) produces the symbol @xmath17 unambiguously and leaves the carrier clean of the remnants of the message , i.e. disentangle the state @xmath109 from the carrier .",
    "it is important to note that due to their local nature the two operations @xmath191 and @xmath193 commute , so that we have the identity _ * k**c*_*k**c*_*n - k*=*c*_*n - k*m_*k**c*_*k * = * c*_*n - k*(m_*k**c*_*k * ) .",
    "however if the operation on the left hand side of this relation , leaves the @xmath6 players in the set @xmath187 with an unambiguous symbol @xmath17 , we can conclude that the operations @xmath194 does the same thing , because the remaining operation @xmath193 , by its local nature , has no effect on the qudits retrieved by the set @xmath187 .",
    "the sole effect of @xmath195 is to disentangle completely the carrier from the message state and make it ready for the next round .",
    "such collaboration is of course necessary for the continuous running of the protocol like any other communication task .",
    "let us now study a simple example , in which we will also see in explicit terms the above argument .",
    "the simplest threshold scheme is the scheme @xmath78 for which @xmath196 and hence @xmath197 or more explicitly as @xmath198 note that for qudits , the operators @xmath199 and @xmath11 ( to be used later ) are defined as @xmath200 and @xmath201 , where @xmath202 .",
    "equation ( [ 35 ] ) shows what kind of encoding circuit alice has to use to encode a state @xmath203 to @xmath204 .",
    "the encoding circuit is shown in figure ( [ circuit ] ) .     from @xmath17 .",
    ", width=302,height=113 ]    moreover it is easily seen from ( [ 012 ] ) that the operator @xmath205 defined as @xmath206 acts as follows on the code states [ propertyz ] |=^-s| .",
    "these encoded states have the nice properties that @xmath207 which shows clearly that any two of the receivers can retrieve the classical secret @xmath17 by local measurements of the encoded state .",
    "the uploading and downloading operators for this scheme are shown in figure ( [ carrierfigure ] ) . +     and @xmath185 ) for a simple @xmath78 threshold scheme .",
    ", width=377,height=151 ]    let us now see explicitly in this example , an instance of the general discussion after equation ( [ sec ] ) . in other words , we want to show that although the cnot action of all three receivers is necessary for disentangling the state @xmath18 from the carrier , it does not mean that full collaboration of the participants is necessary for recovering the message @xmath17 .",
    "that is let us show that even without the collaboration of @xmath185 , @xmath79 and @xmath184 can indeed disentangle and retrieve the message from the carrier .",
    "the collaboration of @xmath185 is only needed to clean the carrier from the message .",
    "+ assume that only two of the participants , say @xmath79 and @xmath184 enact their cnot s on the state @xmath186 .",
    "the resulting state will be @xmath208 thus measurements of qudits @xmath8 and @xmath209 by these two participants reveals the secret @xmath17 , without any need for collaboration of @xmath185 .",
    "+ on the other hand suppose that the player @xmath185 wants to retrieve the message symbols on his own . to this end",
    "he adds to the quantum carrier @xmath210 an extra qudit , in the state @xmath211 and at the end of each round , when all the parties are supposed to act on the carrier by hadamard operators , @xmath185 acts by a suitable bi - local operator on his two qudits , so that in conjunction with the hadamard operators of @xmath212 , @xmath79 and @xmath184 , the quantum carrier transforms to    latexmath:[\\[\\label{bob3a }        this is the only operation he can do in order not to destroy the correlations between stray qudits which is checked randomly by alice and the participants .",
    "+ now when the other participants proceed as usual for entangling a code state @xmath109 to and from the quantum carrier , @xmath185 wants to proceed in a different way to reveal the symbol @xmath17 on his own .",
    "the state of the quantum carrier and the code state @xmath109 , which at the beginning of a round is @xmath214 , after alice cnot operations will develop as follows : + @xmath215 where we use the subscripts @xmath216 to denote the qudits which are respectively sent to @xmath217 and @xmath185 .",
    "+ it is now easily verified that the density matrix of the qudits @xmath218 and @xmath219 is given by @xmath220 which is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "therefore even when one of the participants entangles a qudit to the quantum carrier , refrains from cooperation with others in applying hadamard gates and/or inverse cnot operations , he can not obtain any information about the secret symbol @xmath17 .",
    "+ the collaboration of all the participants , is only necessary for disentangling completely the data from the carrier and making it ready for next use .",
    "this is certainly a feature that any communication protocol should have .",
    "we have developed the concept of quantum carrier @xcite to encompass more complex classical secret and quantum sharing schemes .",
    "we have described the procedure of uploading and downloading messages to and from the carrier in increasingly complex situations , i.e. for quantum key distributions , for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 threshold schemes . as described in the text , for each task a different quantum carrier",
    "is required , although it seems that they all have similar forms ( [ carrier2 ] ) .",
    "we have also shown that simple intercept - resend attacks can destroy the pattern of entanglement in the carrier which can be detected by legitimate parties . in the general @xmath5 secret sharing scheme , although collaboration of all parties is required for the continuous running of the protocol ( i.e. cleaning of the carrier from the remnants of the transmitted messages ) , any set of @xmath6 players can download and retrieve the message .",
    "+ we hope that together with the previous results , the concept of quantum carrier can attract the attention of other researchers who will develop it into more complex forms . an important question is whether there can be universal carriers between a set of players , which can be used for various cryptographic tasks on demand of the players , i.e. quantum key distribution between the sender and a particular receiver , or secret sharing between the sender and a particular set of players . ?",
    "another interesting general question is whether there exist general carriers which can be used to simultaneously send many messages to different receivers via a single quantum carrier , in the same way that frequency modulation is used for such a goal in classical communication .",
    "finally the question of general proof of security of these types of carrier - based protocols remain to be investigated .",

    "in this appendix we want to prove that the vectors in ( [ ecomponents ] ) satisfy the properties ( [ codewords ] ) . that is if we define @xmath221 then @xmath222      consider the following identity : @xmath226=p^m-1\\equiv -1.\\ ] ] expand the first term by using the binomial theorem to find @xmath227=-1.\\ ] ] interchange the order of the two summations and use the definition ( [ sk ] ) to obtain          the recursion relation is valid for @xmath230 .",
    "the lower bound is obvious from the upper limit on the summation .",
    "the upper bound is due to the fact that for @xmath231 , the denominator itself vanishes modulo @xmath223 .",
