    "neutrino flavor oscillation has been well established by observations from experiments involving solar @xcite , reactor @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , and accelerator @xcite neutrinos .",
    "central for describing neutrino oscillation phenomenology is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "the mixing matrix is an invariant quantity , but the parametrization of the mixing matrix can be of different forms  @xcite .",
    "the conventional parametrization for the mixing matrix of dirac neutrinos follows the convention adopted for the quark mixing , proposed in 1984  @xcite prior to the observation of neutrino oscillation .    for three active neutrinos with no sterile neutrino",
    ", the mixing matrix can be expressed as a product of three rotation matrices .",
    "we define @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mixing angles and cp phase , respectively , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "there are several different ways to place the @xmath7 in the rotation matrices .",
    "we follow the standard ckm mixing matrix for the @xmath7 placement in this work .",
    "the conventional ordering of the mixing matrix has been taken to be the product of @xmath10 .",
    "an important feature of such a parametrization is that the three mixing angles are almost decoupled for the solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments . in particular ,",
    "the solar neutrino experiments are mostly sensitive to @xmath11 , the atmospheric neutrino experiments are more susceptible to @xmath12 , and the @xmath0 angle is probed in the short - baseline reactor experiments .",
    "another interesting feature of the conventional parametrization is that @xmath13 , corresponding to maximal mixing , while @xmath14 , signifying minimal mixing . since this convention for parametrizing the neutrino mixing matrix",
    "was adopted prior to the extraction of mixing angles from neutrino oscillation experiments , it is interesting to examine whether or not these features would be preserved in other possible parametrizations . in this paper",
    ", we try to address several questions .",
    "first , how do the three mixing angles depend on the parametrization of the mixing matrix ? will the three mixing angles always be nicely decoupled for different oscillation experiments ?",
    "how are the @xmath7 values in different parametrizations related ? finally , is there any particular parametrization better suited for determining the value of the @xmath7 phase ?",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the parametrizations of the mixing matrix are presented in section  [ sec : nuparam_zero_cp ] for the case of @xmath15 and in section  [ sec : nuparam_nonzero_cp ] for the non - zero @xmath7 case , respectively .",
    "the transformations of the three mixing angles and the one cp - violating phase from one parametrization to another one are also presented in section  [ sec : nuparam_nonzero_cp ] . a discussion on how the expressions for survival or transition probabilities depend on the mixing matrix parametrization is given in section  [ sec : nuparam_prob ] .",
    "we then present the relevant expressions for investigating @xmath7 in various parametrizations in section  [ sec : nuparam_cp_asym ] .",
    "we show that certain parametrizations are more suitable for determining the @xmath7 phase if @xmath0 has a very small value in the conventional parametrization .",

    "is briefly summarized in this appendix by only listing the equations of the nine parameters .",
