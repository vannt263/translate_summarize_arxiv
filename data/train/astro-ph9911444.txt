    "measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have the potential to reveal many of the fundamental properties of the universe ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) . since the measurement of the large scale anisotropies by cobe - dmr ( @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) , many ground - based and balloon - borne experiments have continued to develop the technology necessary to produce accurate measurements of cmb structure on smaller angular scales .",
    "recent results from these experiments have shown evidence for the existence of a peak in the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations at a multipole , @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we present results from the test flight of boomerang that constrain the position and amplitude of this peak .",
    "in fact , the results from this data set alone can be used to constrain cosmological models and provide evidence for a flat universe , @xmath7 ( see the companion paper , melchiorri , et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "boomerang is a millimeter - wave telescope and receiver system designed for a long duration balloon ( ldb ) flight from antarctica of up to two weeks duration .",
    "the data presented here are from a prerequisite test flight of the payload in august , 1997 , which lasted 6 hours at float altitude .",
    "a prototype of the ldb focal plane was used to test the experimental strategy of making a map and measuring the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy with a slowly - scanned telescope and total - power bolometric receiver .",
    "boomerang employs bolometric detectors cooled to 0.3  k , coupled to an off - axis telescope and operated as total power radiometers .",
    "electronic modulation and synchronous demodulation of the bolometer signals provide low frequency stability of the detector system .",
    "the optical signal is modulated by slowly scanning the telescope ( @xmath3 deg / s ) in azimuth .",
    "a description of the instrument can be found in @xcite .",
    "the boomerang telescope consists of three off - axis , aluminum mirrors : an ambient temperature 1.3  m primary mirror and two smaller ( @xmath8  cm ) 2  k reimaging mirrors .",
    "the telescope is shielded from ground radiation by extensive low emissivity baffles .",
    "incoming radiation is reflected by the primary mirror into the entrance window of the cryostat and reimaged by the 2  k optics onto the 0.3  k focal plane .",
    "the tertiary mirror is positioned at an image of the primary mirror and forms a throughput - limiting lyot stop illuminating the central 85  cm of the primary mirror .",
    "the inside of the 2  k optics box has a thick coating of absorbing material ( @xcite ) to intercept stray light . a calibration lamp mounted in the lyot stop of the optical system",
    "is pulsed for @xmath9 0.5 s every 15 minutes to produce a stable , high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath10 ) calibration transfer .",
    "for the test flight , the focal plane contained silicon nitride micromesh bolometers ( @xcite , @xcite ) fed by multi - mode feed horns with channels at 90 and 150  ghz .",
    "fourier transform spectroscopy of each channel determined the average band centers and effective band widths for sources with a spectrum of cmb anisotropy ( table 1 ) .",
    "a long duration @xmath11 cryostat ( @xcite , @xcite ) maintained the focal plane at @xmath12  k during the flight .",
    "the bolometers were biased with an ac current and the signals were demodulated , amplified and passed through a 4-pole butterworth low - pass filter with a cut - off frequency of @xmath13  hz for the 150  ghz channels and @xmath14  hz for the 90  ghz channels .",
    "the bolometer dc levels were removed with a single - pole , high - pass filter with a cut - on frequency of @xmath15  mhz and re - amplified before digital sampling at 62.5  hz with 16 bit resolution .",
    "the attitude control system included a low - noise two - axis flux - gate magnetometer , a ccd star camera and three orthogonal ( azimuth , pitch , roll ) rate gyroscopes .",
    "the azimuth gyroscope drove the azimuth feedback loop , which actuated two torque motors , one of which drove a flywheel while the other transferred angular momentum to the balloon flight line .",
    "the gyroscope was referenced every scan to the magnetometer azimuth to remove long time scale drifts .",
    "pendulations of the payload were reduced by a oil - filled damper mounted near the main bearing and sensed by the pitch and roll gyroscopes outside of the control loop .",
    "the ccd frame had @xmath16 pixels , with a resolution of 0.81 arcmin / pixel ( azimuth ) and 0.65 arcmin / pixel ( elevation ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude of stars used for pointing reconstruction was @xmath17 .",
    "the coordinates of the two brightest stars in each ccd frame were identified by on - board software and recorded at 5  hz , for post - flight attitude reconstruction .    the primary mirror and the receiver",
    "were mounted on an inner frame which could be rotated to position the elevation boresight of the telescope between @xmath18 . during observations ,",
    "the inner frame was held fixed while the entire gondola slowly scanned in azimuth .",
    "the scan speed was set to the maximum allowed by the beam size and bolometer time constants .",
    "the window functions for the 90 and 150  ghz channels in this flight were rolled off at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , by the 26 and 16.5 arcmin beams and were limited to @xmath21 by the system 1/f noise .",
    "the instrument was launched at 00:25 gmt on august 30 , 1997 from the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas .",
    "observations started at 3:50 gmt and continued until the flight was terminated at 9:50 gmt .",
    "sunset was at 01:00 gmt and the moon rose at 10:42 gmt .",
    "the average altitude at float was 38.5 km .",
    "we observed in three modes : @xmath22 hours of cmb scans , 40 minutes of calibration scans on jupiter , and four ten - minute periods of full - sky rotations of the gondola .",
    "the cmb observations consisted of smoothed triangle wave scans in azimuth with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 40 degrees centered on due south at an elevation angle of @xmath23  degrees .",
    "the scan rate was @xmath24 deg / s in azimuth ( @xmath25  deg / s on the sky ) in the linear portion of the scan ( 63@xmath26 of the period ) .",
    "these scans , combined with the earth s rotation , covered a wide strip of sky , from @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain a first order reconstruction of the attitude from the elevation encoder and magnetometer data . using this ,",
    "the stars recorded by the ccd camera are identified .",
    "the data from the gyroscopes are used to interpolate between star identifications .",
    "the offset between the microwave telescope and the star camera is measured from the observation of jupiter .",
    "the attitude solution obtained in this way is accurate to @xmath9 1 arcmin rms .",
    "the results presented in this paper are primarily from the highest sensitivity 150  ghz channel .",
    "data from a 90  ghz channel are presented as a systematic check . the data at float consist of @xmath9 1.4 million samples for each bolometer .",
    "these data are searched for large ( @xmath29 ) deviations such as cosmic ray events and radio frequency interference and flagged accordingly .",
    "flags are also set for events in the auxiliary data such as calibration lamp signals and elevation changes , as well as for the different scan modes .",
    "unflagged data , used for the cmb analysis , are 54@xmath26 of the total at 150  ghz and 60@xmath26 of the total at 90  ghz .",
    "we deconvolve the transfer functions of the readout electronics and the bolometer thermal response from the data , and apply a flat phase numeric filter to reduce high frequency noise and slow drifts .",
    "the time constants of the bolometers given in table 1 are measured in flight from the response to cosmic rays and to fast ( 18 deg / s ) scans over jupiter .",

    "jupiter was also re - observed later during regular cmb scans ( from 5:58 to 6:18 u.t . ) and during full sky rotations .",
    "jupiter was rising during the first observation ( from an elevation of 36.9@xmath45 to 38.2@xmath45 ) and setting during the second one ( from an elevation of 40.1@xmath45 to 39.0@xmath45 ) .",
    "the deconvolved and filtered data from these scans are triangle - interpolated on a regular grid centered on the optical position of jupiter to make a beam map .",
    "the beams are symmetric with minor and major axes equivalent within @xmath46% .",
    "solid angles given in table 1 are computed by integration of the interpolated data .",
    "the beam map is used to derive the window function , @xmath47 , and an overall normalization .",
    "we use a brightness temperature of @xmath48  k for both the 90 and 150  ghz bands ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and assume an uncertainty of @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also assign a @xmath49 error in the conversion from brightness temperature to cmb temperature due to statistical noise in the measurements of the band pass .",
    "errors in the determination of the receiver transfer function are largest at the highest temporal frequencies where signals are attenuated by the bolometer time constants .",
    "these errors affect the calibration of the window function and the cmb power spectrum measurements at the largest multipoles .",
    "these should cancel because the beam maps of jupiter are made from scans at the same scan speed as the cmb scans . in simulations , a 15@xmath26 error in the determination of the bolometer time constant produces a maximum error @xmath50 in the normalization and @xmath51 in the value of @xmath47 at @xmath52 near scan turnarounds where the scan speed was only 1 deg / s .",
    "the final precision of the calibration including errors in the temperature of jupiter , @xmath53 , the transfer function used for deconvolution , the measurement of the filter pass bands and the beam solid angle is 8.1@xmath26 and 8.5@xmath26 at 150  ghz and 90  ghz , respectively .",
    "signals from the internal calibration lamp are used to correct for a slow linear drift in detector responsivity during the flight , mainly due to variation ( 0.29 - 0.28  k ) in the base temperature of the fridge .",
    "the change in response to the calibration lamp from the beginning to the end of the flight is @xmath54 at 90  ghz , and @xmath55 at 150  ghz .",
    "current and future cmb missions require new methods of analysis able to incorporate the effects of correlated instrument noise and new implementations capable of processing large data sets ( bond et al .",
    "the analysis of the boomerang test flight data provides a test of these methods on a moderate size ( @xmath56 pixels ) data set .",
    "the calibrated time stream data are processed to produce a pixelized map , and from this a measurement of the angular power spectrum , using the madcap software package of borrill ( 1999a , 1999b ) ( see http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/@xmath9borrill/cmb/madcap.html ) on the cray t3e-900 at nersc and the cray t3e-1200 at cineca .",
    "noise correlation functions are estimated from the time stream under the assumption that in this domain the signal is small compared to the noise .",
    "for the 150  ghz channel , the maximum likelihood map with 23,561 , 1/3-beam sized ( @xmath57 ) pixels is calculated from the noise correlation function , the bolometer signal ( excluding flagged data and all data within 2 degrees of jupiter ) and the pointing information using the procedures described in wright ( 1996 ) , tegmark ( 1997 ) and ferreira & jaffe ( 1999 ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood power spectrum is estimated from the map using a newton - raphson iterative maximization of the @xmath58 likelihood function following bond , jaffe & knox ( 1998 ) ( bjk98 ) and tegmark ( 1998 ) .",

    "fig : powspec ]    due to finite sky coverage , individual @xmath58 values are not independent , and we estimate the power in eight bins over @xmath63 , binning more finely at low @xmath64 than high . in each bin",
    "we calculate the maximum likelihood amplitude of a flat power spectrum in that bin , i.e. @xmath65constant ( table 2 ) . given our insensitivity to low @xmath64 signal , and in order to ameliorate the effects of low - frequency noise ( which translates into low-@xmath64 structure for this scanning strategy ) , we marginalize over power at @xmath66 and diagonalize the bin correlation matrix using a variant of techniques discussed in bjk98 . bin to bin signal correlations are small but non - negligible , with each top - hat bin anticorrelated with its nearest neighbors at approximately the 10% level .",
    "we calculate likelihood functions for each bin using the offset log - normal distribution model of bjk98 .",
    "we quote errors for the power spectrum from @xmath67 errors assuming simple gaussian likelihood functions and from 68% confidence intervals for the full likelihood functions .",
    "plots of the likelihood functions are presented in the companion paper ( melchiorri , et al .",
    "1999 ) and full spectral data including information on the shape of the likelihood function ( bond , jaffe & knox 1998b ) and appropriate window and filter functions ( knox 1999 ) will be available at the boomerang web site ( http://boom.physics.ucsb.edu or http://oberon.roma1.infn.it/boom ) .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the calculated power spectrum for the 150 ghz channel 6 arcminute pixel map .",
    "the scan strategy and analysis allow for a variety of checks for systematic effects in the data . for all systematic tests we produce small ( @xmath68 pixel ) maps with @xmath69 pixels which can be generated and analyzed quickly ( @xmath9 30 minutes on four t3e-900 processors ) .",
    "monte - carlo simulations show the effects of the 16@xmath35 pixelization are negligible for values of @xmath70 .",
    "compared to the level of statistical noise , we find that the derived power spectrum from the 150  ghz channel is insensitive to ( i ) the size of the excluded region around jupiter , ( ii ) the choice of spectral shape within the multipole bins , and ( iii ) the method of marginalizing over low @xmath64 signals .",
    "we also analyze maps made from combinations of data that we expect to produce null power spectra in the absence of spurious sources of noise power : ( i ) data from a dark detector and ( ii ) the difference between left and right - going scans at 150 ghz . in each case ( table 3 ) , we find a power spectrum consistent with zero .",
