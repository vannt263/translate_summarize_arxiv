    "the experimental discovery of the inclusive and exclusive @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite decays stimulated the study of rare b meson decays as a new force .",
    "these decays take place via flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath12 transitions , which are absent in the standard model ( sm ) at tree level and appear only through loops .",
    "therefore , the study of rare b - decays can provide a sensitive test of the structure of the sm at loop level and may shed light on the kobayashi - cabibbo - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and the leptonic decay constants of the b - mesons . at the same time , such decays are in a very promising class to search for new physics beyond the sm , like two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , etc .",
    "currently , the main interest is focused on these decays for which the sm predicts large branching ratio and which can be measured in near future in the constructed b - factories .",
    "the @xmath13 decay belongs to this category . in the sm ,",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath14 decay is of order @xmath15 without qcd corrections . including leading log ( llog ) qcd corrections , the branching ratio @xmath16 @xmath17 is of the same order of magnitude @xmath18 like @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of @xmath14 decay is interesting for the following reasons :    * it is well - known , that the qcd corrections to the @xmath20 decay are considerably large ( see @xcite - @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , one can naturally expect that the situation is the same for the @xmath21 decay .",
    "recently the qcd corrections in the llog approximation to this decay have been calculated and found to be large as expected @xcite - @xcite .",
    "note , that in the literature this decay without qcd corrections was analysed in the sm @xcite - @xcite and in the 2hdm @xcite . * in @xmath14 decay , the final photons can be in a cp - odd or a cp - even state .",
    "therefore this decay allows us to study cp violating effects .",
    "* from the experimental point of view , @xmath14 decay can be easily identified by putting a cut for the energy of the final photons , e.g. , the energy of each photon is larger than @xmath22 . in this case ,",
    "two hard photons will be easily detected in the experiments @xcite .",
    "* finally , this decay is also sensitive to the physics beyond the sm .    in an earlier analysis @xcite",
    ", the @xmath23 in the 2hdm without qcd corrections was found to be enhanced with respect to the sm one for some values of the parameter space . in the present work , we study @xmath14 decay in the 2hdm with perturbative qcd corrections in llog approximation .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , who used the constituent quark model , we impose a model based on heavy quark effective theory for the bound state of the meson @xmath24 .",
    "further we perform an additional analysis with the inclusion of long - distance effects through the transition @xmath25 , which we call @xmath26-type throughout this paper , see @xcite for details .",
    "we find , that the theoretical analysis is shadowed by large uncertainties due to the renormalization scale @xmath6 and the parameters of the bound state . the decay @xmath27 is dominated by the wilson coefficient @xmath28 ( see section 2 ) , which is restricted in our analysis by the @xmath29 branching ratio provided by cleo data @xcite , @xmath30 , see section 3 . without any improvement from the theoretical side",
    ", we see that the only chance to detect a deviation from the sm in @xmath0 decay lies in a possible enhanced branching ratio , which can be at most @xmath31 in the sm @xcite and @xmath32 in model ii of the 2hdm ( for @xmath33 gev and large @xmath2 ) resulting from our analysis , at @xmath34 gev including the @xmath26-type long distance effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give the llog qcd corrected hamiltonian responsible for the @xmath17 decay .",
    "we further calculate the cp - odd @xmath35 and cp - even @xmath36 amplitudes in an approach based on heavy quark effective theory , taking the llog qcd corrections into account . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the constraint analysis for the 2hdm parameters @xmath5 and @xmath37 , using the measured data on the branching ratio of the @xmath38 decay @xcite .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an analysis of the dependence of the ratio @xmath8 and the @xmath39 on the parameters @xmath6 ( scale parameter ) , @xmath40 and @xmath5 and our conclusions .",
    "before discussing the llog qcd corrections to the @xmath41 decay , we would like to remind the main features of the models which we use in further discussions . in the current literature ,",
    "mainly two types of 2hdm are discussed . in the so - called model i ,",
    "the up and down quarks get a mass via the vacuum expectation value ( v.e.v ) of only one higgs field . in model ii ,",
    "the up and down quarks get mass via v.e.v of the higgs fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , where @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) corresponds to first ( second ) higgs doublet of the 2hdm .",
    "note , that in this sense the higgs sector of model ii coincides with the mssm extension of the sm . in the 2hdm , there exist five physical higgs fields , namely , two charged @xmath44 and three neutral higgs bosons .",
    "the interaction lagrangian of the quarks with the charged fields , which we need for the calculation of the @xmath21 decay amplitude , is @xcite @xmath45 v_{ij } h^{+ } + h.c.\\,\\ , , \\label{lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote chiral projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ratios of the two vacuum expectation values , @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the higgs fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 are the elements of the ckm matrix . in model ii , @xmath54 and in model",
    "i @xmath55    after this preliminary remark , let us discuss the llog qcd corrections to the @xmath56 decay amplitude in the 2hdm .",
    "the framework to incorporate short - distance qcd corrections in a systematic way is that of an effective low energy theory with five quarks , namely u , d , s , c , b quarks .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is obtained by integrating out the heavier degrees of freedom , i.e. the top quark , @xmath57 and @xmath44 bosons . in the effective theory , only the lowest ( mass )",
    "dimension operators , which are constructed by quark and gauge fields , are taken into account , since higher dimensional operators are suppressed by factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the llog qcd corrections are done through matching the full theory with the effective theory at the high scale @xmath60 and then evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath61 down to the lower scale @xmath62 . in this way",
    "the llog qcd corrections for the @xmath63 decay in the sm are calculated in @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian relevant for our process is @xmath64 where the @xmath65 are operators given in eq .",
    "( [ o7 ] ) and the @xmath66 are wilson coefficients renormalized at the scale @xmath6 . the coefficients can be calculated perturbatively and the hadronic matrix elements @xmath67 can be calculated using some non - perturbative methods .    the operator basis of @xmath68 is given as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are @xmath72 colour indices and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the field strength tensors of the electromagnetic and strong interactions , respectively .",
    "for the reason given below , the llog qcd corrections can be calculated in analog to the sm . in the 2hdm ,",
    "the charged higgs fields are present and give new contributions due to the their exchange diagrams . since the interaction vertices of the charged higgs bosons and quarks are proportional to the ratio @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mass of the quark and @xmath77 is the mass of the w boson , the main contribution comes from the interaction with the t - quark .",
    "we neglect the contributions coming from @xmath78 and @xmath79 quarks , since their masses are negligibly small compared to @xmath77 . in this case",
    "the calculations show , that the new contributions modify only the wilson coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 of the operators @xmath1 and @xmath82 at @xmath77 scale and do not bring any new operators @xcite .",
    "therefore the operator basis used in the 2hdm is the same as the basis used in the sm for the @xmath21 decay .    denoting the wilson coefficients for the sm with @xmath83 and the additional charged higgs contribution with @xmath84",

    "we would like to make the following remark : since in our case there exists a charged higgs boson with a mass larger than @xmath77 , the correct procedure to calculate the wilson coefficients at a lower scale @xmath6 has two stages : first , we calculate the value at @xmath61 starting from @xmath5 and second , we evaluate the result from @xmath61 down to a lower scale @xmath6 .",

    "however , at @xmath138 the ratio reaches @xmath139 and the uncertainty due to the extended higgs sector is weaker than the one due to the scale @xmath6 . in model",
    "i , the behaviour is the same .",
    "this shows , that the ratio @xmath125 is quite sensitive to qcd corrections and this strong @xmath6 dependence makes the analysis of the 2hdm parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 for the given experimental value of the ratio @xmath125 difficult .",
    "however , we believe , that the strong @xmath6 dependence will be reduced with the addition the of next to leading order ( nlo ) calculation , and the analysis on the parameters will be more reliable . note , that a similar analysis for the decay @xmath20 is given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is another uncertainty due to the different parameter sets ( table  ( [ mums ] ) ) . for set 2 @xmath140 and for set 1 @xmath141 in the sm and in the lowest order of @xmath142 .",
    "it follows , that the larger @xmath143 ( smaller @xmath105 ) , the larger the ratio .",

    "if we include qcd corrections to the considered ratio , the contribution of @xmath28 dominates over the ipi sector and the value of the ratio increases .",
    "this means , that the values of @xmath36 and @xmath35 come close to each other and it can be explained as a cancellation of the ipi sector .",
    "now we continue to analyze the @xmath39 displayed in a series of figures 8 - 13 . in fig .",
