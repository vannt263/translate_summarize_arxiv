    "in the last decade there has been considerable interest in the possibility that the fundamental `` constants '' of nature may actually change with time  @xcite .",
    "although it remains controversial , there is growing evidence that the fine structure constant may have varied by an amount of order a few parts in @xmath2 over a period of 510 billion years  @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that this variation may have a dipole structure as we look back in different directions  @xcite .",
    "although this possible variation is quite small , within the framework of most attempts at grand unification , a variation of @xmath3 implies considerably larger percentage changes in quantities such as @xmath4 and in the quark masses  @xcite .",
    "for example , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the variation @xmath5 would be of order 38 times that of @xmath6 .    in the light of these developments",
    "it is very natural to ask what other signatures there may be for such changes .",
    "these may , for example , be the consequent changes in hadron masses or magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in some cases the level of precision possible in modern atomic , molecular and optical physics means that it may even be feasible to detect the minute variations expected under the hypothesis of linear variation until the present day over a period as short as a year  @xcite .",
    "another consequence of a variation in the parameters relevant to hadron structure is the possibility of observable consequences in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) or other nuclear phenomena such as the composition of the ash of long extinct natural nuclear reactors  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the effect of quark mass changes on the nucleon - nucleon force has been studied in effective field theory  @xcite , most recently including constraints from lattice qcd  @xcite . for the moment these lattice studies are at too high a quark mass to provide an accurate constraint  @xcite . in an alternative approach based on a more traditional model of the nucleon - nucleon force",
    ", the latest work of flambaum and wiringa  @xcite on this topic involved the study of the variation of nuclear binding with quark mass using the argonne potential and schwinger - dyson estimates of the variation of meson masses .    in this work",
    "we employ a one boson - exchange ( obe ) model of the nuclear force to calculate the variation with changes in the quark mass of the binding energies of selected finite nuclei as well as the energy of the @xmath0s@xmath1 anti - bound state and the binding energies of the deuteron and triton .",
    "apart from its intrinsic interest , this approach complements the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and a comparison of the two provides one way to gauge the possible model dependence of the variations reported . the method used here involves a detailed study of the variation of the mass of each of the mesons usually employed in a one - boson - exchange ( obe ) picture of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) force .",
    "care is taken to estimate this shift at the relevant kinematic point , not just at the real , on - shell meson mass or its pole position .",
    "these changes are then introduced into the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model for some light nuclei and a typical obe model for the two nucleon systems and a faddeev calculation of the triton .    in section",
    "ii we examine , in turn , each of the mesons @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "section iii presents results for finite nuclei , while the two nucleon system and triton are discussed in section iv .",
    "the final section is reserved for some concluding remarks .",
    "in order to find the variations in the mass of the exchanged bosons in the nuclear interaction ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ) with respect to changes in the mass of the pion @xmath12 , we use three ideas .",
    "first we introduce a description of the bare mass of the @xmath9 ( @xmath13 ) in terms of @xmath12 using the nambu - jona - laisino ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "second , we introduce the contribution from the self energies for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we include these self energies in two different ways : for the @xmath9 the loop diagram is fixed in such a way that the total propagator contains a pole on the second sheet of the complex energy plane at the position found by leutwyler _",
    "et al . _  @xcite",
    "; for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 we use the chiral fit to partially quenched data from lattice qcd developed by armour _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "finally , through the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation we relate those changes to variations in the quark masses .      in this work",
    "we choose to parametrize the intermediate range attraction in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath16 ) force in terms the exchange of a @xmath9 meson , following the traditional one - boson - exchange ( obe ) approach .",
    "earlier work on the effect of changes in quark masses by flambaum and wiringa  @xcite , used explicit two - pion exchange for this purpose .",
    "almost certainly the reality is somewhere in between these extremes and a comparison between our results and those of ref .",
    "@xcite should serve to pin down the uncertainties in this sector of the calculation .",
    "the existence of the @xmath9 meson has been somewhat controversial , largely because its width is comparable with its mass .",
    "however , a careful dispersion relation treatment using the roy equation has served to accurately locate a pole which can be unambiguously identified with the @xmath9 meson .",
    "of course , because of the large imaginary part of the energy of this pole , one can not easily relate the position of the pole to the position of a bump in the @xmath17 cross section .",
    "when it comes to the mass of the virtual @xmath9 meson exchanged in a obe @xmath16 potential , it is a third value that is of interest .",
    "indeed , the invariant mass of a meson exchanged in a typical @xmath16 interaction is very near zero and so we actually need the sigma mass for @xmath18 .",
    "this is most readily found within an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "meson . ]    our model for the @xmath9 meson involves a `` bare '' @xmath9 meson coupled to two pions . when required , the variation of the mass of this bare state with quark mass will be calculated within the njl model . in this approach ,",
    "the propagator of the dressed @xmath9 is described as a bare scalar propagator plus an infinite series of contributions of the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . calling this self - energy @xmath19 ,",
    "the total propagator can be written as : @xmath20 which resums to [ propsigma ] _",
    "the pole in @xmath21 is the mass of the @xmath9 resonance .",
    "this pole was calculated by leutwyler _",
    "_ using the method of roy equations , which is model independent  @xcite .",
    "they obtained a pole located in the complex second sheet for @xmath22 at [ poleleutw ] p = m_- = 441_-8^+16-i272_-12.5^+9   .",
    "the real part of the position of the resonance , @xmath23 mev , is in the range @xmath24 mev given by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , while its width , @xmath25 mev , is within the range @xmath26 mev , also from the pdg .",
    "having a reliable value for the @xmath9 pole we can find a relation that lets us fix @xmath19 such that [ poleeq ] 441-i272  . with derivative coupling of the bare @xmath9 to two pions ( consistent with chiral symmetry ) , the expression for the @xmath17 self - energy is found to be : @xmath27   ^{2}}{\\left (   k^{2}-m_{\\pi}^{2}\\right )   \\left ( \\left (   p - k\\right )   ^{2}-m_{\\pi}^{2}\\right )   } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 represents the pion loop momentum , @xmath22 the @xmath9 momentum and @xmath29 the @xmath30 coupling ( initially we took the value @xmath31 from harada , sannino , and schechter  @xcite ) .",
    "we are considering all these particles as elementary , so this is just an effective theory , and like any other effective theory it has to be regularized .",
    "the regularization scheme we choose is to impose a dipole cut - off ( at each vertex ) on the loop momentum with mass @xmath32 : [ regulator ] ^-4 , which is sufficient to ensure convergence .",
    "this dipole regulator contains simple poles in @xmath28 ( after writing it in the form of derivatives with respect to @xmath32 ) , which permits us to use contour integration over the time component .    for the remaining integral over the three - momentum we rotated @xmath33 in the complex plane @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , to ensure that the imaginary part is located in the complex second riemann sheet .",
    "we also performed a numerical integration with the help of the routine _ nintegral _ of _ mathematica_. the final value of @xmath36 depends on two parameters : the regularization mass @xmath32 , and the coupling constant @xmath37 .",
    "we choose a range of values for @xmath32 such that , after fixing @xmath37 and @xmath38 to reproduce the pole position ( eq .  ) , @xmath38 varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 mev .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tabsigma1 ] , where @xmath41 represents the deviation of our result for the pole position from that of leutwyler and collaborators .",
    ".parameters fixed to reproduce the position of the @xmath9 meson pole ( @xmath42 @xmath43 ) .",
    "( @xmath44 is the deviation of the fitted from the empirical value . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the deuteron our result , @xmath45 , is very close to that reported by flambaum and wiringa  @xcite using the av14 potential , namely @xmath46 .",
    "similarly for the triton , our value @xmath47 is very close to their value of @xmath48 .",
    "the closeness of these results for two rather different treatments of the nn force lends considerable confidence in their reliability .",
    "however , for the position of the @xmath49 anti - bound state our calculation differs considerably from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , taking the opposite sign .",
    "this suggests that this quantity may be rather more model dependent than has been realized hitherto .    in the case of light nuclei",
    ", the binding energies reported here were calculated in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model , a relativistic mean - field model that takes into account the self - consistent response of the internal structure of the nucleon to these mean fields . through the self - consistency ,",
    "the model yields many - body  @xcite or equivalently density - dependent interactions  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the density dependent skyrme forces derived from qmc have proven remarkably realistic  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath50 deduced in this way for @xmath51li , @xmath52c and @xmath53o are reported in eqs .",
    "( [ eli7])-  ( [ eo16 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the value obtained for @xmath51li , namely @xmath54 , is significantly larger than that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath55 ( av14 ) and @xmath56 ( av18+uix ) .",
    "these authors did suggest that the uncertainty on the value of @xmath57 could be as large as a factor of two and our value is consistent at that level .",
    "clearly , this degree of variation calls for more investigation to see whether the model dependence can be reduced .",
    "our study of these variations of binding energies with quark mass is , of course , motivated by the possible effects on big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . amongst the many challenges there ,",
    "the sizeable discrepancy in the abundance of @xmath51li with the latest photon - to - baryon ratio ( post wmap ) is of particular interest .",
    "figure  [ 7li_variation_with_mq ] illustrates the @xmath51li abundance calculated using the bbn code of kawano  @xcite , if one allows _ only _ the binding energy of the deuteron and the energy of the virtual @xmath49 state to change with quark mass .",
    "the curves correspond to the values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 calculated here ( solid line ) as well as the values used by berengut _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( dashed line ) .",
    "the substantial difference in slope means that while a 3% shift in @xmath5 would suffice to reproduce the empirical abundance using the values of berengut _ et al .",
    "_ , with our values this would require a huge change in quark mass .",
    "this simple example illustrates the importance of a complete study of the bbn problem including all of the consequences of a shift of quark mass within the current approach , which we leave for future work .",
    "li with respect to changes in the quark mass in @xmath60 calculated in the same way as @xcite ( dashed - red line ) and using our results for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( continuous - blue line ) .",
    "]    finally , we note that while the variation of the light quark masses should be most important , it will also be necessary to take into account the effect of a corresponding change in the strange quark mass , especially now that the strange quark sigma commutator seems to be under control  @xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council through the arc centre of excellence in particle physics at the terascale and through the australian laureate fellowship ( fl0992247 ) , as well as by the university of adelaide .",
    "from table  [ tablebind ] we find the variations of the binding energies for the deuteron and triton ( @xmath63 with @xmath64 ) , and the position of the pole for the @xmath0s@xmath1 anti - bound state @xmath65 ; according to changes in the mass of the hadrons ( @xmath66 ) : = _ h m_h .",
    "we then relate the variation of the mass of each hadron to the variation of the quark mass , as given in eq .",
    "( [ vary ] ) : = _ h , so that : m_h = ( _ hm_h ) . combining those results",
    "we finally obtain the formula that gives rise to the results in eqs .  ,   and",
