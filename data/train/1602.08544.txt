    "the classical gauss problem of minimizing the coulomb energy to solve the problem of thomson and its generalization to riesz potentials together with the discretization is the basic problem of many applications ( in @xcite are listed coding theory , cubature formulas , tight frames and packing problems ) . in the works",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the discretization is obtained by approximating the minimizing charges by a distribution of finitely many dirac measures on the given manifold .    if the number of dirac points tends to infinity , then the minimizing densities approach distributions in the form of sobolev space elements . therefore , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the minimizing measures are considered as distributions in hilbert spaces of finite riesz energy .",
    "this continuous setting is simpler and more efficient from the numerical point compared to the discrete approach in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    for potentials with riesz kernel @xmath11 ,",
    "where @xmath12 , and borel measures supported on a given @xmath3-dimensional manifold @xmath5 immersed into @xmath6 , a surface potential is generated , which on @xmath5 defines a boundary integral operator with weakly singular kernel .",
    "this boundary integral operator is a pseudodifferential operator of _ negative _ order @xmath13 if @xmath14 .",
    "the energy space of this pseudodifferential operator on @xmath5 is thus the sobolev space @xmath15 of distributions and the minimizing measure of finite energy is an element of this sobolev space .",
    "hence , the determination of the minimizer is reduced to an optimization problem with a quadratic functional which is defined in terms of the single layer riesz potential on @xmath5 .",
    "the strong ellipticity of the corresponding pseudodifferential operator in @xmath16 and its trace on @xmath5 then provides the coerciveness of the associated quadratic functional . for @xmath17 , which corresponds to the newtonian kernel ,",
    "the riesz energy of the single layer potential is just its dirichlet integral over @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    ", however , we consider the riesz kernels with @xmath19 . for @xmath20 , in classical potential theory , the energy of the harmonic double layer potential in @xmath18 now equals the riesz energy if we define the latter as to be hadamard s partie finie integral of the hypersingular potential  which is the natural distributional regularization ( see section [ s : double ] where @xmath5 is a @xmath3-dimensional planar bounded domain in @xmath6 ) .",
    "let @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are finitely many compact , connected @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4-manifolds immersed into @xmath6 . in section [ s : manifold ] , we then consider the riesz potential as a pseudodifferential operator just on @xmath8 since we can not use its extension to @xmath24 ( for @xmath25 , the transmission conditions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  8.3.11 ) are not satisfied ) .",
    "we call the bilinear form with the strongly singular partie finie integral of the riesz kernel the _ energy of the riesz potential_. the partie finie integral operator with the hypersingular riesz kernel defines now a strongly elliptic pseudodifferential operator @xmath26 of _ positive _ order @xmath27 on @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to the analysis of weakly singular riesz kernels provided earlier by the authors in  @xcite , @xcite , in the case under consideration , the trace theorem in @xmath28 is not valid anymore , because of the negativity of the order @xmath29 , cf .",
    "nevertheless , we have succeeded in overcoming this difficulty , and we have shown that all the borel measures on @xmath8 with finite riesz energy whose restriction on any @xmath22 takes sign either @xmath30 or @xmath31 form a certain cone in the sobolev space @xmath32 , @xmath33 . _ this is our main result in section [ s : manifold ] , theorems [ th:3.3 ] and [ th:3.4]_. in this framework , the corresponding gauss variational problem admits a unique solution which belongs to @xmath32 , which is a compact subspace of @xmath34 .",
    "these results have again a potential theoretic meaning in the particular situation @xmath35 in relation to the harmonic double layer potential as explained in section  [ s : null ] .    in the fundamental work @xcite by d.p .",
    "hardin and e.b .",
    "saff , discrete minimal energy problems have been investigated . there , the discrete riesz energies are obtained by distributing a finite number ( @xmath36 ) of evenly weighted dirac measures on a compact @xmath3-dimensional manifold @xmath37 where the set @xmath38 is excluded . then , the discrete minimal riesz energy determines an optimal geometric arrangement of the @xmath36 distinct dirac points on @xmath37 . in @xcite ,",
    "three cases are distinguished : ( i ) the riesz kernel is weakly singular , ( ii ) the case @xmath39 ( see @xcite ) , and ( iii ) the hypersingular case @xmath40 .",
    "for all these three cases , the behavior of the discrete minimal energies for @xmath36 tending to infinity is explicitly determined ( see section  [ s : mini ] below for details ) . in the works",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , these results are generalized to more general riesz kernels with weights .    during a miniworkshop in august 2012 in stuttgart with e.b .",
    "saff , d.p .",
    "hardin , and p.d .",
    "dragnev , we have learned from them that in the hypersingular case the discretized minimal energies tend to infinity if the number of dirac basic points approaches infinity and at the same time those minimizing charges tend to a charge with a constant density .",
    "this discussion inspired us to pick up this topic gratefully in our paper and to analyze also this approach by cutting out the set @xmath41 of @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "we first figure out the idea in section  [ s : mini ] by studying a perturbed riesz energy problem .",
    "then , in section [ s : comp ] , we perform the computations in detail for the punched riesz energy problem and give an asymptotic expansion of the solution in the corresponding family of finite energy spaces for @xmath44 . in particular cases ( see corollary [ c:4.6 ] for details ) , the minimizers tend to a constant distribution on @xmath5 while the corresponding minimal energies tend to infinity .",
    "we shall motivate our approach by an example from potential theory where @xmath45 , i.e.  @xmath46 . to this end , let @xmath47 be a planar bounded domain in @xmath6 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 when @xmath50 , see figure  [ fig : plane ] for an illustration .",

    "the energy of the harmonic field @xmath69 is given by its dirichlet integral , and green s theorem yields @xmath70 we can interchange differentiation and integration in this expression by means of hadamard s finite part integral .",
    "namely , due to @xmath71 with the constant @xmath72 , it holds @xmath73 where @xmath74 is hadamard s finite part integral with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and with the hypersingular kernel function @xmath77 , that is @xmath78 ( for the definition of hadamard s partie finie integral operators , see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
