    "bianchi s works on the classification of all admissible lie algebras upon a @xmath0-dimensional homogeneous manifold @xcite have represented an important step forward in the comprehension of the relationship between geometry and algebra .",
    "few decades later , this interplay shed light into the mathematical features of the four - dimensional spacetime with the development of einstein s theory of gravity . since the belinskii - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite on the general behaviour of space - times near the cosmological singularity",
    ", the bianchi models have played an important role in physics , particularly in the early cosmology .",
    "it was shown that when one goes back in time towards the initial cosmological singularity , the curvature terms dominate upon the matter ones and a general metric in this regime is a sort of a generalization of kasner solutions which , in its turn , are special cases of bianchi type - i spaces .",
    "thenceforth , the behaviour of bianchi type - i cosmological models has been systematically studied for a large class of fluids , assuming non - linear equations of state @xcite , in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite , scalar fields @xcite , nonlinear stokesian fluids @xcite and achieving generic qualitative results @xcite . however ,",
    "when dissipative terms are taken into account , algebraic relations between the energy - momentum tensor and the geometry are usually considered .",
    "this assumption leads to a simplified system of equations where the qualitative behaviour of the solutions can be comprehensively understood @xcite . on the other hand , by applying the laws of classical thermodynamics , the dissipative processes do not evolve according to hyperbolic equations and , therefore , they are not relativistic and may violate causality .    with this in mind , we shall investigate in this paper the role played by the causal thermodynamics in the description of the dissipative terms of the energy momentum tensor of the cosmic fluid in a bianchi - i scenario , based on the israel and stewart @xcite formulation of the relativistic thermodynamics of irreversible processes , which provides a finite speed of propagation for the viscosity and the heat flow .",
    "a somehow truncated version of such thermodynamic theory has already been applied to study the bianchi type - i cosmologies @xcite , while its exact formulation in such context was still missing ( up to our knowledge ) .",
    "the paper is summarized as follows . in section [ bianc - visc ]",
    ", we present a special set of variables to describe the einstein equations for a diagonal bianchi type - i metric in the presence of viscous fluids .",
    "these variables have clear mathematical and physical interpretations in terms of standard deviations and kinematic quantities .",
    "section [ analytic ] provides some analytic solutions with interesting cosmological implications , particularly , for late times .",
    "since the resulting equations are generically non - integrable , in section [ qualit ] we apply some basic tools of the qualitative theory of differential equations to describe the topological behaviour of the solutions close to the fixed points , including the asymptotic ones , by assuming barotropic fluids as its gravitational sources . for the sake of comparison with other references on the subject",
    ", the notation adopted here agrees with the one used in @xcite .",
    "we also use geometric units @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated , where @xmath2 is the light speed in empty space and @xmath3 is the einstein gravitational constant .",
    "the diagonal bianchi type - i spacetime is such that the hypersurfaces at constant time describe euclidean spaces .",
    "its infinitesimal line element is commonly expressed in cartesian coordinates as @xmath4 ^ 2{\\rm d}x^2+[l_{2}(t)]^2{\\rm d}y^2+[l_{3}(t)]^2{\\rm d}z^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are the scale factors in each spatial direction .",

    "the same happens with the components @xmath34 of the anisotropic pressure [ see equations ( [ par - dpi - beta])].,width=264,height=264 ]    we now have the standard deviation of the pressures in different directions as a measure of the magnitude of the anisotropy in the matter content @xmath35 and a similar parametrization of the plane defined by equation ( [ con_dpi ] ) can be performed [ see also figure [ fig1 ] ] @xmath36 \\pi_2&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\,\\pi\\,\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\beta+\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right),\\\\[2ex ] \\pi_3&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\,\\pi\\,\\sin\\left(\\alpha+\\beta+\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , which we name the _ anisotropy phase _ , is the angle between the euclidean vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the continuity equation is represented by equation ( [ ee2 ] ) .",
    "note that , with this set of variables , we end up with first order differential equations only .",
    "it should also be remarked that equations ( [ ee1])([ee3 ] ) correspond to an open system . as was previously mentioned",
    ", there are several ways to fix the arbitrariness present in these equations , which are usually performed by taking into account algebraic relations between the metric and the fluid components ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we shall use here the causal thermodynamics @xcite to play this role in what concerns the dissipative terms , by adding differential equations instead of algebraic ones .    the dynamical equation for @xmath34",
    "is given in @xcite as @xmath46 where the thermodynamic parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 , phenomenologically dependent upon the thermodynamic quantities , are the relaxation time and the shear viscosity , respectively . in terms of the standard deviations @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the anisotropy phase @xmath41 , we can rewrite equations ( [ therm_pi ] ) , as @xmath51 & & \\dot\\beta+\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sigma}-\\frac{\\xi}{\\tau}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\pi}\\right)\\sin\\beta=0.\\label{ev_beta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the combination of equations ( [ ee31 ] ) , ( [ stand_pi ] ) and ( [ ev_beta ] ) , we can find a first integral of the system of differential equations from the `` norm of the vector product '' between @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an integration constant . from equations",
    "( [ stand_pi ] ) and ( [ ev_beta ] ) we also see that , when the system approaches a thermodynamical equilibrium configuration in an expanding universe scenario , we have that @xmath41 goes to @xmath56 or @xmath57 if the mean values of the anisotropies are both nonzero .",
    "there is another interesting relation between the anisotropies provided by the above equations which is    @xmath58    for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , this means that the term within the parenthesis has an upper bound and , therefore , the anisotropies can not grow indefinitely .    differently from previous works on this subject , which consider a phenomenological relation between the thermodynamic parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the energy density @xmath61 ( see @xcite for instance )",
    ", we will assume them as constants for simplicity , unless otherwise stated .",
    "this choice will change qualitatively the behaviour of the solutions as we shall see afterwards , since @xmath47 and @xmath48 may contribute even if the energy density is small .",
    "in this section , we concentrate our efforts on the task of finding classes of exact solutions of physical interest for the system of equations ( [ ee1])([ev_beta ] ) .      as a matter of comparison with our approach through the standard deviation variables @xmath50 and @xmath49 , we first revisit the equations for bianchi - i models with perfect fluids , see for instance @xcite or section 14.4 of @xcite for more details .",
    "then , for @xmath47 and @xmath48 both identically equal to zero , the aforementioned system of equations can be completely integrated , resulting in @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are integration constants ; from equation ( [ ee1 ] ) , we may interpret @xmath63 as the density parameter associated to the contribution of the anisotropy to the total energy of the universe .    in the absence of matter ,",

    "when the matter content is present and we take the pressure as a known function of @xmath16 and @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath78 , then we can use the continuity equation ( [ ee2 ] ) to write the energy density in terms of the mean scale factor @xmath79.\\ ] ] thus , the modified friedmann equation can be used to obtain an implicit expression for @xmath80 : @xmath81 from equation ( [ par - dhi - alpha ] ) , we compute the integral of the @xmath13 s as follows @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 . therefore , the line element becomes in this case @xmath85{\\rm",

    "therefore , bianchi - i models filled in with anisotropic fluids allow for solutions represented by periodic orbits , as already noticed by van den hoogen and coley in @xcite .      the cases described above present an accelerated scenario which may possibly represent only part of the time evolution of the universe .",
    "let us comment on how one could produce a more realistic situation from such exact solutions by supposing that the thermodynamic parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 have a time dependence , since the thermodynamic quantities they originally depend upon are also functions of time .",

    ". motivated by the current cosmological scenario , we assume the linear equation of state of a perfect fluid , namely @xmath267 with @xmath268 $ ] as a constant , allowing room for mechanical instabilities ( for @xmath269 ) . elimination of the energy density @xmath61 from the modified friedmann equation ( [ ee1 ] ) in equation ( [ sys_dyn_3 ] ) yields @xmath270 it is then easy to see that the equilibrium conditions require @xmath271 the character of the eigenvalues of the system in the @xmath272 case is rather complicate .",
    "when @xmath77 , it simplifies considerably and only the origin @xmath273 corresponds to an equilibrium point if @xmath200 and @xmath274 .",
    "the eigenvalues can be obtained from equation ( [ eigen_i ] ) as @xmath275 and @xmath276 , and their corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath277 when @xmath278 , the set of equilibrium points coincides with the @xmath185-axis and we are in a particular situation of case @xmath239 .",
    "for @xmath279 , we obtain a set of equilibrium points given by the @xmath50-axis and now the situation is a special case of @xmath253 .",
