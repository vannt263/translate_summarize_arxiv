    "the possibility to drive resolved intersite transitions strongly depends on the lattice wavelength and depth , as illustrated in figure [ fig : couplings1 ] .",
    "we calculated the coupling strengths as a function of the lattice depth ( using a numerical calculation of the second term in equation 2 , see also @xcite ) for @xmath49 transitions , for three different lattice wavelengths : close to resonance ( @xmath50  nm ) , far blue - detuned ( @xmath51  nm ) and far red - detuned ( @xmath52  nm ) .",
    "the choice of these wavelengths is motivated by the availability of powerful enough lasers ( @xmath53  w in the far detuned cases , up to several watts close to resonance ) , allowing to reach a sufficient depth of a few recoil energies with a relatively large waist ( @xmath54  1  mm ) .",
    "such a waist is required for minimizing parasitic forces due to the dipolar potential gradient along the longitudinal direction when using such a system for high precision measurements ( gravimetry , short range forces , fine structure constant @xcite ... ) .     versus lattice depth for three different lattices wavelengths @xmath51  nm , @xmath52  nm and @xmath50  nm .",
    "@xmath37=780  nm . ]    at sufficiently low depths , of a few @xmath55 , we find coupling strengths of the same order of magnitude for the far blue and red detuned cases whereas the intersite coupling remains small for the close to resonance case .",
    "we find relatively large variations and modulations for the far detuned cases , with respect to the close to resonance case .",
    "calculations performed for @xmath56 transitions showed similar behaviors . nevertheless , tilting by the same angle both raman lasers with respect to verticality",
    "allows to preserve the direction of @xmath57 while reducing its magnitude , thus changing the coupling strengths . as an example , we plot in figure [ fig : couplings2a ] the couplings in the close to resonance case for @xmath57 reduced by a factor of 2 , which corresponds to an angle of @xmath58 with respect to verticality .",
    "although we find larger coupling strengths , which oscillate versus lattice depths , couplings comparable to the far detuned cases for @xmath59 are only reached at twice lower lattice depth .",
    "versus lattice depth for a lattice wavelength @xmath50  nm and tilted raman beams giving an effective wavelength of @xmath60  nm . ]     and @xmath61 . ]    another important parameter depending on the lattice wavelength is the tunneling rate out of the bottom band , which limits the lifetime of the atoms in shallow lattices . for an estimate of this rate , we use the landau - zener formula .",
    "figure [ fig : couplings2b ] displays the calculated rates as a function of the lattice depth ( in units of recoil energies ) for low depths of 2 and 3  @xmath55 .",
    "the lz tunneling rate remains small in the far blue detuned case , even for lattices as shallow as @xmath62 , whereas it becomes comparable to @xmath63 s@xmath64 for a lattice depth @xmath6 between 2 and @xmath61 in the close to resonance case .",
    "operation at @xmath51  nm thus appears more appealing as one can combine large lifetimes and good couplings for large site offsets @xmath65 .",
    "we have compared these calculations with measurements corresponding to the blue detuned case .",
    "our system @xcite consists in laser - cooled @xmath38rb atoms loaded in the first band of a vertical one - dimensional optical lattice , created by a single mode frequency doubled nd : yvo@xmath66 laser ( @xmath67  nm , maximal power 12  w ) with a waist of about 700  @xmath68 m .",
    "as this blue detuned standing wave does not provide transverse confinement , a red detuned ( @xmath69  nm , beam waist @xmath70 m ) yb fiber laser is superimposed to the lattice ( see figure [ setup ] ) .",
    "the difference in the waists of the two lasers allows to reduce inhomogeneities in the lattice depth due to the transverse extension of the atomic sample . before being transferred into this mixed dipole trap , about @xmath71 atoms",
    "are loaded in a 3d - magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and cooled down to @xmath72k with a far detuned molasses .",
    "the dipole trap lasers are switched on either at the end of this cooling phase , or at the beginning of the mot sequence .",
    "switching off the molasses lasers leaves about 1 @xmath73 of the atoms trapped in the mixed trap with a lifetime of about 1 s. these atoms initially distributed in all the zeeman sublevels of @xmath74 are then depumped to @xmath75 before being optically pumped ( @xmath76 efficiency ) on the @xmath77 transition to the @xmath78 zeeman sublevel , which is sensitive to stray magnetic fields only to second order . after being released from the optical trap ,",
    "atoms fall for about 140 ms before reaching the detection zone located at the bottom of the vacuum chamber .",
    "the detection scheme is based on a time of flight measurement similar to the ones used in atomic clocks and inertial sensors .",
    "it allows to measure by fluorescence the atomic populations in the two hyperfine states @xmath79 and @xmath80 , denoted @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively @xcite , from which we derive the transition probability @xmath83 .",
    "the raman transitions are driven by two counterpropagating , circularly polarized beams at @xmath84  nm , detuned from the atomic transition by about @xmath85  ghz , and aligned along the direction of the optical trap beams .",
    "these are collimated with a @xmath86 radius of @xmath63 cm , ensuring a good intensity homogeneity along the transverse size of the trap .",
    "in order to determine the coupling strengths , a raman spectrum is first scanned by measuring the transition probability as a function of the frequency difference between the raman lasers @xmath87 .",
    "for such scans , the intensities in the raman laser beams are @xmath88 and @xmath89 mw@xmath90@xmath91 , and the duration of the raman pulse is 8 ms .",
    "this ratio between the raman intensities is chosen to cancel the differential light shift they induce on the frequency of the hyperfine transition @xcite .    .",
    "the resonances separated by the bloch frequency @xmath92  hz are the signature of intersite transitions . ]",
    "we observe multiple resonances , corresponding to transitions between the two hyperfine levels at raman frequencies equal to the hyperfine splitting plus or minus an integer number @xmath65 of bloch frequencies ( @xmath92  hz in our system ) .",
    "the difference in the peaks heights is due to the difference in the coupling strengths .",
    "we then fix the raman frequency difference at the center of each peak , record a rabi oscillation pattern by measuring the transition probability as a function of the pulse length , from which we extract the rabi frequency .",
    "we repeat this procedure for different lattice laser power values",
    ". the measured coupling strengths of the @xmath93 transitions are plotted in figure [ fig : couplings ] as a function of the lattice laser power .",
    "the results have been normalized and the relation between lattice laser power and actual lattice depth has been adjusted for a better match with the theoretical predictions .",
    "data points corresponding to minima in the couplings have larger error bars as inhomogeneities in the rabi frequencies damp so heavily the rabi oscillations that almost no oscillations are observed .",
    "we attribute this inhomogeneity to the transverse spread of the atoms , which experience different lattice depths due to the gaussian profile of the lattice beam .",
    "the good agreement between the measurements and the theoretical predictions allow us to determine the depth with a resolution on the order of @xmath94 from the direct comparison of the relative amplitudes of the peaks .",
    "alternative techniques for the determination of the lattice depth are not as accurate here : diffraction in the thick grating limit @xcite creates sidebands in the velocity distribution which can hardly be resolved due to the width of the initial velocity distribution of the order of @xmath95 , and parametric excitation gives rise to very wide resonances due to the complete anharmonicity of the lattice potential .    .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath29 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "solid lines are the result of numerical evaluation of equation [ eq2 ] . ]",
    "we then investigated the question of the linewidth of such transitions .",
    "various effects are expected to contribute to the broadening of the transitions and to ultimately limit the minimally attainable linewidth .",
    "one of them is the differential light shift ( dls ) induced by the trapping laser beams .",
    "this effect is dominated by the light field of the transverse dipole trap , as atoms are trapped at the intensity maxima of the 1064  nm beam and observe maximal dls@xmath96 at its center . by performing microwave spectroscopy on the @xmath97 transition",
    ", we measure a shift in the center of the line of about 3  hz / w , and a broadening of about 2  hz / w , which gives a limit to the linewidth of 3  hz at the 1.5  w we typically use .",
    "we have also measured the shift of the line induced by the lattice laser beam and found a much smaller effect of 0.4  hz at full power .",
    ", as a function of the pulse duration @xmath98 . for each different pulse duration",
    ", the probe s rabi frequency @xmath99 is adjusted so that @xmath100 .",
    "the solid line shows the theoretical fourier - limited fwhm of a pulse of duration @xmath98 . ]",
    "this broadening is illustrated in figure [ fig : linewidth ] , which shows the evolution of the linewidth as a function of the duration of the microwave pulse , where the microwave power has been adjusted for optimal transfer at resonance ( which corresponds to the case of a @xmath101 pulse ) , as well as in figure [ fig : ls ] , which shows as a dotted line the microwave spectrum corresponding to a pulse duration of 1.4 s.    s. the compensated transition s detuning to the hyperfine frequency of @xmath102  hz is the zeeman quadratic shift due to a bias field of @xmath103  mg .",
    "the mean dls imposed by the transverse trapping laser is @xmath104  hz . ]    the dls@xmath96 induced by the transverse trapping laser can be compensated thanks to an additional laser beam with a blue detuning for the @xmath1 state and a red detuning for the @xmath0 state @xcite . for that purpose ,",
    "a small fraction of one of the two raman beams is used , with an additional detuning of 80  mhz in order to prevent undesired raman transitions .",
    "this beam is superimposed with the transverse trapping laser beam and its size , position and power are adjusted to reduce the broadening of the microwave transition . for a transverse trapping laser power of 1.5  w ,",
    "the differential light shift is compensated with a power of @xmath105  nw .",
    "figure [ fig : ls ] displays as a continuous line the microwave spectrum for optimal compensation .",
    "the linewidths of the raman transitions are displayed in figure [ fig : linewidth ] , for uncompensated ( resp .",
    "compensated ) dls@xmath96 , as squares ( resp .",
    "circles ) .",
    "the ratio between the intensities of the two raman lasers is set to cancel ( on average ) the net differential light shift they induce .",
    "however , due to differences in the spatial modes of the two raman lasers and parasitic reflections , this compensation is not perfect , which leads to a broadening of the hyperfine transition . as this",
    "broadening is proportional to the total raman intensity , the linewidth is proportional to the rabi frequency of the transition , only increased with respect to the fourier - limited microwave transition by a constant factor of about 1.5 .",
    "atom loss prevents us from driving longer transitions .",
    "nevertheless , our system allows us to achieve a spectroscopic resolution of about 1  hz , which can be of interest for selecting atoms in a single site of the lattice , as demonstrated in @xcite with less resolved transitions .    in order to study the short term sensitivity of our system",
    ", we performed a spectroscopic measurement of the bloch frequency by measuring alternately the frequency of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 and calculating the difference to cancel any shift of the hyperfine clock frequency .",
    "we obtained a statistical uncertainty on the bloch frequency of @xmath108 in relative value after 1  s of integration , which is a factor of 3 better than the previously reported sensitivity in @xcite using ramsey spectroscopy .",
    "the best sensitivity reported for a trapped accelerometer was @xmath109 in relative value after one hour measurement time @xcite , which corresponds to an equivalent relative short term sensitivity of @xmath110 at 1 s.",
    "performing the raman scan over a larger frequency range reveals additional features .",
    "figure [ fig : scan ] displays such a spectrum for two different lattice depths of 4 and @xmath111 ( measured by raman spectroscopy as described in the last paragraph of section [ section1 ] ) . note the large blue sideband , which corresponds to transitions from the bottom band to the first excited band .",
    "the absence of red sideband indicates that the trapped atoms have been loaded in the bottom band and that upper bands are not populated",
    ".     corresponds to unresolved intersite transitions in the same lattice band .",
    "the large structure arising between 10 and 50  khz is due to a coupling from the bottom to the first excited band . ]",
    "we have measured the lifetime of the atoms in the first excited band for a lattice depth of @xmath112 .",
    "a raman pulse of 2  ms detuned by 30  khz transfers 60  @xmath73 of the atoms initially in @xmath79 in the excited band in the @xmath80 state .",
    "when increasing the delay between the raman pulse and the turning off of the lattice laser , and measuring the number of the atoms that have remained trapped , we observe a decay in the number of atoms in @xmath80 .",
    "corresponding data are displayed in figure [ fig : lifetime ] , from which we extract an exponential lifetime of 16  ms .",
    "this relatively short lifetime explains that for trapping times as large as several hundreds of ms , only the bottom band is populated .",
    "loading the shallow lattice from the initial thermal distribution simply selects atoms loaded in the bottom band .        transitions between vibrational states along the transverse directions can also be induced by the raman lasers , provided that their effective wavevector projection along the transverse direction is not null .",
    "such transitions are exploited for instance for raman sideband cooling @xcite . to do so , we simply tilt the raman retroreflecting mirror .",
    "figure [ fig : transverse ] displays zooms of the raman spectrum close to the @xmath106 transition , for a raman pulse of 400  ms , for @xmath113 perfectly vertical ( continuous lines ) and tilted by a few mrad ( dotted line ) .",
    "we find red and blue sidebands about 25  hz apart from the carrier , which correspond to transitions @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the index of the transverse vibrational level .",
    "we find equal amplitude for both sidebands , indicating that atoms are distributed among many such @xmath115 states .",
    "the transverse temperature was independently measured by time of flight fluorescence imaging to be @xmath116k .",
    "in addition , the sidebands are significantly broadened with respect to the carrier .",
    "this broadening is attributed to the anharmonicity of the potential , the depth of the transverse dipole trap being only about 4 times the average transverse kinetic energy .",
    "transition , when the raman lasers wavevector is slightly misaligned from the lattice s one .",
    "the two sidepeaks correspond to intersite transitions involving a change in the transverse vibrational state . solid line : the raman lasers wavevector is aligned with the lattice s one . ]",
    "we have investigated the possibility to drive intersite transitions in an optical lattice using raman transitions .",
    "we have shown that good couplings between neighboring wells and high resolution raman spectroscopy could be achieved in a composite trap , formed by a shallow blue detuned vertical lattice combined with a 1064 nm laser progressive wave for transverse confinement .",
    "broadening due to the inhomogeneity of the differential light shift of the trapping laser can be prevented using an additional laser beam for differential light shift compensation .",
    "raman transitions allow for a precise determination of the parameters of the shallow 1d lattice ( depth , band filling , radial oscillation frequency ... ) .",
    "this spectroscopic tool allows for a sensitive determination of the bloch frequency , for instance using the ramsey type interferometer scheme demonstrated in @xcite , and can be used for the measurement of short range forces , when such an interferometer is created close to a surface @xcite .",
