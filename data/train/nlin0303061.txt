    "the dynamics of nls solitons and single pulses even in the presence of various perturbations is well understood ( see e.g. refs .",

    "however , the evolution of several pulses is not studied in details . in recent works",
    "@xcite ( see also book  @xcite ) mostly an interaction of solitons and near - soliton pulses was considered .",
    "a study of _ near - soliton _ pulses , especially a use of the effective particle approach , often results in small variation of soliton parameters , including the soliton velocities and as a consequence weak repulsion or attraction of solitons .",
    "such a study do not involve a possibility of appearance of additional solitons .",
    "however , for many applications it is necessary to consider the interaction of pulses with arbitrary amplitudes or pulses with different parameters .",
    "for example , in optical communication systems with the wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) , the initial signal consist of several solitons with different frequencies .",
    "an estimation of the critical separation between pulses is important for determination of the repetition rate of a particular transmission scheme .    in present work the interaction of two pulses in the nls model",
    "is studied both theoretically and numerically .",
    "we show the presence of different scenarios of the behaviour , depending on the initial parameters of the pulses , such as the pulse areas , the relative phase shift , the spatial and frequency separations .",
    "one of our main observation is a fact that a pure real initial condition of the nls equation can result in additional _ moving _ solitons . as a consequence the number of solitons , emerging from two pulses separated by some distance , can be larger than the sum of the numbers of solitons , emerging from each pulse .",
    "such properties were also found for the manakov system @xcite , which is a vector generalization of the nls equation .",
