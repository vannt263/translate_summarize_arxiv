    "disk - like structures are believed to be ubiquitous around young protostars .",
    "these disks are dissipated very early in pre - main - sequence ( pms ) evolution , perhaps by powerful stellar jets / outflows or photodissociation by the far - ultraviolet flux from nearby massive ob stars . despite their short lives ,",
    "the timescales and mass dependence of disk dissipation have far reaching consequences in astrophysics : the efficiency of disk depletion could be the strongest factor in determining the timescales on which planets form in a particular stellar system @xcite , or whether they form at all @xcite .",
    "disks probably play a significant role in early angular momentum regulation and the dissipation timescale is thought to control the spread in rotation rates of young stars @xcite .",
    "stars may accrete a significant fraction of their final mass from a circumstellar disk , so the timescale and mass dependence of that accretion influences pms evolution and thus attempts to estimate ages and masses from evolutionary pms models @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of disk frequencies can provide a stern test for low - mass stellar and brown dwarf formation theories .",
    "for instance , models involving competitive accretion and subsequent ejection of brown dwarfs from protostellar aggregates @xcite may imply shorter disk dissipation times for the lower mass fragments .",
    "observed disk frequencies in samples of young stars with different ages , masses and environments provide an empirical determination of disk lifetimes .",
    "judging from l - band excesses , young clusters exhibit high disk frequencies ( @xmath780% , e.g.  the trapezium cluster : @xcite ) up to ages of @xmath81.5myr , which then decrease rapidly with age : at @xmath83myr , 50% of disks have been dissipated , and the timescale for all cluster members to lose their disks may be as short as @xmath86myr @xcite .",
    "such timescales have been questioned by a high disk frequency in the 9myr @xmath9chamaeleontis cluster , a sparsely populated cluster with no massive stars @xcite .",
    "@xmath2orionis is a trapezium - like system with an o9.5v primary .",
    "the population of low - mass stars spatially clustered around this system was discovered as bright x - ray sources in rosat images , and follow - up optical spectroscopy confirmed most sources as pms stars @xcite .",
    "this association is young , nearby and affected by low reddening , making it an ideal target to analyse the pms population even down to brown dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and isolated planetary mass objects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at an age of 3@xmath15myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath2orionis cluster is at a crucial stage in terms of disk evolution and it is therefore a key case to better constrain disk dissipation timescales .",
    "recently , a possible proto - planetary disk , apparently on the process of being dissipated , has been discovered very close to @xmath2ori @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-excess disk frequency is 5@xmath11% for the low - mass and brown dwarf members of the @xmath2orionis cluster @xcite . on the other hand , the presence of strong h@xmath12 emission suggests accretion disk frequencies as high as 30% @xcite .",
    "however , the most reliable method to determine the disk frequency in a low - mass population is by measuring the @xmath13 colours and deriving colour excesses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have obtained l - band observations of 6 @xmath2ori cluster members , finding two with a @xmath13 excess .",
    "the significance of this result is obviously limited by the size of the sample .",
    "we have performed l@xmath0-band ( 3.8@xmath14 m ) observations of a representative sample of 28 cluster members , using the newly installed imager uist at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "young stars are well known for their variability across the spectrum including infrared ( ir ) wavelengths @xcite , therefore we have obtained nearly simultaneous k - band observations for all our targets . in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of this survey , and discuss our derived disk frequency within the framework of disk destruction timescales by comparing with similar surveys in other young clusters .",
    "we have an on - going program to observe in the l - band @xmath2ori cluster members identified at optical wavelengths .",
    "we describe here the observations of 28 of the brightest cluster members : their positions , @xmath15 magnitudes , 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) @xmath16 and @xmath10 magnitudes , the new k- and l@xmath0-band magnitudes and identifications are listed in table[obs_table ] .",

    "* zo02 ) have spectroscopically confirmed cluster membership for both these sets of objects .",
    "the remaining objects are spectroscopic cluster members found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the i - band magnitudes are from either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the brighter objects in the sample are mostly from the x - ray selected sample @xcite while the fainter objects were photometrically and spectroscopically selected . in sect.5.1",
    "we discuss the effects of possible selection biases on our results .",
    "searching for circumstellar disks around these 24 objects is the main goal of these observations . to this sample",
    "we have added 4 objects that are known iras sources in the region ( no reference entry in table[obs_table ] ) .",
    "they have been confirmed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as mid - infrared sources with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) consistent with them being young stars with dusty circumstellar disks ; thus , based on their location , youth and infrared excesses they are also likely to be members of the @xmath2ori cluster .",

    "+    pms objects are young and have lower surface gravities than the field dwarfs used to calibrate the empirical relations used in the previous section @xcite .",
    "we investigated if theoretical models ( see sect.2.2 ) could be used to predict k- and l@xmath0-band magnitudes for our sample .",
    "if , in the @xmath18 diagram ( fig.[colour_colour ] ) , we compare the colours of objects with no apparent excess with the theoretical isochrones of @xcite , the model @xmath3 colours seem to be too blue ( even bluer than corresponding giant colours ) , especially for earlier spectral types ( @xmath19mag ) . in terms of surface gravity , we would expect pms stars to have colours between main - sequence and giant stars , therefore we opt to use empirical spectral type calibrations to compute @xmath3 excesses .",
    "furthermore , a disk frequency based on the comparison with model colours would not be readily comparable to other surveys that tend to use the main - sequence calibration .",
    "if model colours were used , the @xmath18 diagrams implies that a larger fraction ( @xmath880% ) of objects would have an @xmath3 excess .     and @xmath20 excesses .",
    "these excesses were computed with respect to the targets predicted colours from their spectral types .",
    "the filled circles are objects with known spectral types @xcite whereas open circles represent objects with spectral types estimated from their @xmath21 and @xmath20 colours .",
    "the triangles represent the iras objects : filled for objects with known spectral type and open for lower limits to the excess ( see text ) .",
    "the errors are the uncertainties in the measured and intrinsic @xmath3 combined in quadrature ( see text ) ; the error bars in @xmath22 are typically the size of the plotting symbol.,height=604 ]    spectral types are known for 18 objects in the sample .",
    "spectral types are also known for 2 of the iras sources .",
    "for the 6 objects identified by @xcite spectral types are not known .",
    "their @xmath21 and @xmath20 colours may be used to estimate spectral types , as none of these objects show considerable excess in the k - band .",
    "we use tabulated relations between spectral type and colours ( again from @xcite ) to define linear relations between spectral type and each colour ( these relations are only valid for spectral types later than m2 ) .",
    "these are then interpolated and averaged to obtain the spectral type for the sources .",
    "the results are in column2 in table[excess_table ] ( indicated by @xmath17 ) .",
    "we apply the same procedure to the stars with known spectral types in order to test its validity . for the 10 sources with known spectral type later than m2 , we obtain the following : for 6/10 stars we compute the correct spectral type within 0.5subclass , for 3/10 within 1subclass and for 1/10 within 1.5subclass .",
    "so we are confident that our computed spectral types are mostly correct to within 1subclass .    even though these may not be the most accurate spectral type determinations , they are easily adequate for the purposes of computing @xmath3 excesses . between spectral types",
    "m2 and m6 , one subclass is equivalent to at most a variation of 0.055mag in photospheric @xmath3 colour and 0.05mag in @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt these values as estimates of the errors in the excesses introduced by this procedure ; spectral types from the literature are uncertain by 0.5 subclass . for each target",
    "we have now spectral types and we have computed @xmath20 and @xmath3 excesses that are listed in columns4&7 in table[excess_table ] . for the 2 iras sources without known spectral types , we compute lower limits for their excesses by assigning them spectral type m6 ( even though their brightness clearly indicates earlier spectral type ) and photospheric colours of respectively @xmath23mag and @xmath24mag .    in fig.[excess_spt ] we plot the computed excesses against k - band magnitude for both @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "the error bars are obtained by adding in quadrature the photometric uncertainty in the colours with the uncertainty introduced by the spectral type determination .",
    "as expected all 4 iras objects have very large excesses in the l@xmath0-band , consistent with their mid - ir colours @xcite .",
    "we consider that an object has a circumstellar disk if it exhibits an excess detected at a 2-@xmath2 level .",
    "thus 11/24 ( or 46% ) objects show a @xmath3 excess .",
    "if we arbitrarily adjust for the systematic effect discussed on sect.3.2 , then the computed excesses would be larger by about 0.04mag and 14/24 objects would have a significant excess .",
    "the sample we discuss here is not complete , but we believe it is representative . as we discuss below , there is no serious bias either for or against the detection of disks in this sample ( apart from the 4 iras sources ) .      the equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath12 emission line has traditionally been used to classify t tauri stars ( tts ) : classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) are defined as having large ew[h@xmath12 ] as evidence of circumstellar accretion and thus of the presence of a circumstellar disk ; weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) have chromospheric ew[h@xmath12 ] thus showing no signatures of accretion .",
    "ctts are found to be underluminous in x - rays when compared with wtts in the same star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would imply that surveys for circumstellar disks in x - ray selected samples may be biased towards objects with no accretion disk signatures , depending on the sensitivity of the x - ray surveys .",
    "but many pms stars classified as wtts based on their h@xmath12 emission were actually found to have circumstellar disks .",
    "@xcite found that a large fraction of wtts in ic348 have considerable @xmath13 excesses , i.e.  wtts are not necessarily naked tts .",
    "furthermore , @xcite provided statistically significant evidence that accreting stars in ic348 have lower x - ray luminosity when compared with non - accreting objects , but found _ no evidence _ for a difference between stars with or without @xmath13 excess .",
    "this suggests that x - ray selection will not impair the detection of circumstellar disks in the l - band , even though it might be biased against strongly accreting objects .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in the next section , about half of the x - ray selected cluster members have large @xmath3 excesses , similar to the overall disk fraction .      another potential source of bias has to do with the spectroscopic identifications of cluster members .",
    "the presence of the lii 6708  feature in stellar spectra is a sure sign of youth at least in the mass range we are considering here .",
    "however , photospheric spectral lines in ctts can be heavily veiled at optical wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the hot continuum attributed to disk accretion can fill - in the lii 6708  line ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the sample was selected on the basis of the detection of the lithium feature , therefore our estimated disk frequencies could be regarded as a lower limit .",
    "@xcite found a few objects in their sample of cluster candidates that show no lithium in their spectra but have radial velocities and nai doublet strengths consistent with cluster membership .",
    "however , their measured h@xmath12 line widths are not consistent with accreting pms objects @xcite . no evidence has been found for heavily - veiled strongly - accreting cluster members , therefore we consider that the spectroscopic selection of cluster members is not a significant source of bias .          in this section",
    "we compare @xmath3 excesses with other disk indicators .",
    "@xcite describe spectra of 18 of the stars in our sample ( table[obs_table ] ) ; in particular they have measured equivalent widths for the h@xmath12 emission and several forbidden emission lines .",
    "a classification criterion for pms stars based on ew[h@xmath12 ] has to take into account the different levels of chromospheric h@xmath12 emission observed for different spectral types @xcite . @xcite",
    "have proposed the following ( empirical and spectral - type dependent ) classification : a pms star is classified as a ctts if ew[h@xmath12]@xmath63  for k0@xmath1k5 stars , ew[h@xmath12]@xmath610  for k7@xmath1m2.5 stars , ew[h@xmath12]@xmath620  for m3@xmath1m5.5 stars and ew[h@xmath12]@xmath640  for m6@xmath1m7.5 stars .",
    "this classification was devised using high - resolution spectra , so when applying it to intermediate- and low - resolution spectra ( as is the case here ) we have to take into account that ew[h@xmath12 ] is probably overestimated due to blending with a nearby tio feature .",
    "the presence of forbidden lines ( e.g. [ oi ] , [ nii ] and [ sii ] ) in the spectrum of a pms star is evidence of jets and outflows that are also related with accretion processes and circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig.[halpha",
    "] ( left ) , we plot ew[h@xmath12 ] and spectral types for the objects from @xcite ; on the right we plot ew[h@xmath12 ] against @xmath3 excesses .",
    "we can see that 4 objects show ew[h@xmath12 ] in excess of what is expected for their spectral types ; these 4 objects have @xmath3 excesses of the order of 0.17@xmath10.98mag , consistent with the presence of circumstellar disks ( objects 3 , 14 , 17 and 19 in tables[obs_table ] & [ excess_table ] ) . of these 4 objects , 3 exhibit spectra with forbidden line emission ( objects 3 , 14 and 19 ) . of the 10 objects that were x - ray selected",
    ", only one object has a large ew[h@xmath12 ] ; half of these objects have a @xmath3 excess .",
    "the iras sources have , as expected , large @xmath3 excesses , as they also have large mid - ir excesses @xcite .",
    "there are also 3 objects that have @xmath3 excesses larger than 0.4mag , but do not show large ew[h@xmath12 ] .",
    "this again illustrates that @xmath3 is the most efficient and robust disk indicator .",
    "h@xmath12 emission is known to be extremely variable @xcite and objects that have @xmath3 excesses indicative of circumstellar disks could alternate from episodes of high accretion activity ( ctts state ) to episodes of undetected accretion activity ( wtts ) .",
    "more interestingly , if we interpret this as an evolutionary sequence ( i.e.  the disk - star system evolves from an accreting system , through a weakly or non - accreting system , to a naked pms star ) , this could be an indication that circumstellar disks can survive for some time after accretion onto the stellar surface has stopped .",
    "the @xmath2ori cluster is at a crucial stage of disk destruction ( see next section ) and we would indeed expect to find a mixture of objects that are still accreting and others where accretion has strongly diminished or ceased .",
    "the most complete analysis of clusters disk frequencies is described in ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "they compile the results of several cluster surveys in the k- and l - bands .",
    "these authors have consistently used the same method to determine which objects possess a @xmath13 excess : they place cluster members in a @xmath26 colour - magnitude diagram  only those objects with @xmath22 magnitudes brighter than the completeness limit of the @xmath27 survey are considered , to assure that stellar photospheres are detected in both bands ; they count the stars that lie to the right of the reddening vector that passes through the position in this diagram of an m5 main - sequence star .",
    "we can apply exactly the same procedure in fig.[colour_colour ] ( top right ) : 13/24 stars ( 54@xmath415)% . ]",
    "are to the right of the reddening band .",
    "this result depends on the adopted reddening law  the reddening law defines the position of the boundary between objects with and without excesses  but the different determinations are within the quoted statistical errors @xcite . depending on the spectral type distribution of the sample , this method might underestimate the true disk frequency particularly for earlier spectral types @xcite .",
    "according to this technique , the @xmath2ori cluster has a ( 54@xmath415)% @xmath5-excess disk frequency , at an age of 3@xmath18myr . how does this compare with other clusters ?",
    "such comparison can be done by placing the @xmath2ori cluster in fig.1 from @xcite that plots the fraction of @xmath26 excess objects against stellar age for several young clusters and associations . in terms of its age ,",
    "the @xmath2ori cluster can be compared with ngc2264 ( age@xmath83.2myr , disk frequency 52%@xmath44% ) and ngc2362 ( age@xmath85myr , disk frequency 12%@xmath410% ) .",
    "crucially , the measurements for these two clusters  particularly ngc2362  allowed the authors to estimate that the overall disk lifetime is about 6myr , with 50% of the disks dispersed by about 3myr . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath2ori cluster can play a key role to better constrain disk destruction timescales . in @xcite analysis ,",
    "the ages of the clusters were determined using different pms models and these authors estimate that this introduces an overall systematic uncertainty in the ages of the order of 1.2myr .",
    "the age of @xmath2ori is also not well established ( see discussion sect.2.2 ) : 3@xmath15myr is favoured by several authors ( @xcite ; this work ) with an upper limit of 8myr @xcite .",
    "if the age of the cluster is @xmath284myr then our estimate of disk frequency is consistent with the above mentioned timescales .",
    "however , if the cluster is older than 4myr , then our result suggests a slower disk destruction , i.e. a longer overall disk lifetime .",
    "the ngc2264 and ngc2362 surveys are for objects more massive than @xmath80.85m@xmath29 ( i.e.  earlier spectral types ) while our sample populates the range 0.13@xmath11.0m@xmath29 .",
    "as mentioned above , this technique might be at fault for earlier spectral types .",
    "furthermore , if disk - destruction timescales are mass - dependent then one has to be careful when comparing these results .",
    "@xcite analysed @xmath13 excesses in the @xmath89myr , sparsely - populated @xmath9chamaeleontis cluster .",
    "they found that of the 12 late - type stars in the central part of the cluster 7 objects have @xmath13 excess .",
    "their mass range is comparable to the mass range of our sample , but even so the disk frequency in @xmath9cha is remarkably high for its age .",
    "environmental effects might explain such result : disk destruction timescales might be controlled also by the stellar density in the star - forming region and by the photoevaporation power of nearby o - stars . if this is the case , then @xmath9cha can not be straight forwardly compared with the other clusters .      @xcite investigates the observational signatures of circumstellar disks in a simple evolutionary scenario by which disk mass ( of small particles ) decreases with time ( for a stellar effective temperature of 4000k , spectral type k7-m0 ) . except for high disk masses , the main contribution to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is from reprocessing of starlight ( or disk irradiation ) , as inferred from observations @xcite . for the @xmath13 excess ( or @xmath30 )",
    "their circumstellar disk model predicts that : _",
    "i _ ) large excesses ( @xmath31 0.7mag ) can only be achieved with the contribution of accretion luminosity from massive disks ; _ ii _ ) for passive disks , @xmath30 is insensitive to disk mass over several orders of magnitude ; _ iii _ ) for disk masses lower than 10@xmath32m@xmath29 , @xmath30 decreases rapidly .    in our sample ,",
    "9 of the objects have spectral types k7@xmath1m0.5 and 3 of these objects have large excesses ( @xmath7 0.7mag ) that can hint at a contribution from accretion luminosity to the seds",
    ". only one of these objects shows signatures of accretion in its spectrum ( sect.5.2 ) but variability likely plays an important role .",
    "the objects with later spectral types tend to have modest excesses ( @xmath28 0.4mag ) , consistent with disk irradiation .",
    "in this paper we present new k- and l@xmath0-band photometry for a representative sample of @xmath2orionis cluster members . different methods and disk - excess criteria will provide somewhat different disk frequencies .",
    "we computed a disk frequency for this cluster of ( 54@xmath415)% , if measured directly from the @xmath5 colour - colour diagram , or ( 46@xmath414)% , if excesses are computed with respect to predicted photospheric colours ( according to the objects spectral types , 2-@xmath2 excess detections ) .",
    "therefore , when trying to determine a disk destruction timescale , one has to be consistent in the methods used .    an overall disk lifetime of 6myr has been proposed , but this relies heavily on the age and disk frequency derived from ngc2362 ( age@xmath85myr and disk - frequency@xmath812% , @xcite ) .",
    "the disk frequency for the @xmath2ori cluster could increase support for this timescale , but we find that the crucial factor is not so much the derived disk frequency , but the _ age determination _ of the cluster . as is the case for most young clusters @xcite ,",
    "the age of the @xmath2ori cluster is uncertain , with a likely age in the range 3@xmath15myr @xcite .",
    "if the cluster age is about 3myr then it lends support to the above mentioned disk lifetimes .",
    "however , if the cluster is older than 4myr then it points towards slower disk destruction timescales .    if disk dissipation timescales are mass dependent then the disk frequencies derived for the different clusters are not so readily comparable .",
    "another factor that is probably relevant is the environment of the star forming region , in particular the rates of close stellar encounters and the amount of ionizing radiation produced by massive ( o - type ) cluster members .",
