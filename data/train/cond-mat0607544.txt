    " time \" is a concept that has gained a lot of attention from thinkers from virtually all disciplines@xcite . in particular , our ordinary perception of space and time is not the same , and",
    "this gap has been appearing in a variety of contemplations of nature .",
    "it appears to be the main reason for the theory of relativity , which has conceptually brought space and time closer to receiving equal treatment , continues to fascinate and attract arguments from diverse fields .",
    "also , issues such as  directions `` or  arrows '' of time are current interests of research@xcite .",
    "another manifestation of this gap is the treatment of noise or fluctuations in dealing with dynamical systems .",
    "when we consider dynamical systems , whether classical , quantum , or relativistic , time is commonly viewed as not having stochastic characteristics . in stochastic dynamical theories ,",
    "we associate noise and fluctuations with only `` space '' variables , such as the position of a particle , but not to the time variables . in quantum mechanics , the concept of time fluctuation is well accepted through the time - energy uncertainty principle .",
    "however , time is not treated as a dynamical quantum observable , and a clearer understanding has been explored@xcite .    against these backgrounds ,",
    "our main theme of this paper is to consider fluctuation of time in classical dynamics through a presentation of simple models .",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "the first type includes fluctuations for the time point of events to affect the dynamical change .",
    "the second type is such that the fluctuation is in the flow of time variable itself .",
    "both types exhibit behaviors which are similar to stochastic resonance .",
    "the general differential equation form of the class of dynamics we discuss here is given as follows .",
    "@xmath0    here , @xmath1 is the dynamical variable given as a function of time @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the `` dynamical function '' governing the dynamics .",
    "the difference from the normal dynamical equation appears in @xmath4 , which contains stochastic characteristics , and @xmath5 in general . in other words ,",
    "the change of @xmath6 is governed by a function @xmath3 , not from its `` current '' state @xmath6 , but its state at @xmath4 , which is given by some stochastic rules .",
    "we can define @xmath4 in a variety of ways , as well as the function @xmath3 in normal dynamical equations . in the following ,",
    "we will present two models and investigate their properties through computer simulations . in order to avoid ambiguity and",
    "for simplicity , these models are dynamical map systems incorporating the basic ideas of the general definition given above .",
    "the first model we start with is a special case , which is given as follows .",
    "@xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the dynamical variable and @xmath9 is the time containing noise term @xmath10 . the dynamics progress by incrementing @xmath11 with constant parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we fix the noise @xmath10 to take a value between @xmath15 with a uniform probability .",
    "this is a special case as the dynamical function @xmath16 depends only on time and not on @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath17 , it recovers ordinary dynamics with a sinusoidal path .",
    "we have performed computer simulations for this dynamical map with different sets of constants .",
    "the examples of the time series and associated power spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "the most notable characteristics are as we change the noise `` strength '' or `` width '' given by @xmath14 , a rhythmic behavior appears and disappears .",
    "this is shown by the change in the peaks of the power spectrums , an example of which we plotted in figure 1f .",
    "the spacing of the peaks appearing in figure 1f is one half the period of the dynamical function , indicating @xmath14 is a source for producing in and out of phase dynamics . at the same time",
    ", we note that the role of noise is important , as when we set @xmath10 to be a constant rather than a random variable , the resulting dynamics is a simple sinusoidal time series and a change in the peak height is not observed .",
    "the periodical oscillatory dynamics emerging by `` tuning of noise '' has been studied under the name of `` stochastic resonance''@xcite and investigated in a variety of fields@xcite .",
    "we observe here a similar behavior with stochasticity in time rather than in space variable .    , @xmath18 , and the noise widths @xmath14 are set to ( a ) @xmath17 , ( b ) @xmath19 , ( c ) @xmath20 , ( d ) @xmath21 , and ( e ) @xmath22 .",
    "the simulation is performed up to @xmath23 steps and 20 averages are taken for the power spectrum .",
    "the unit of frequency @xmath24 is set as @xmath25 , and the power @xmath26 is in arbitrary units .",
    "graph ( f ) is the peak height @xmath27 as a function of the noise width @xmath14 . ]    our second model",
    "is given as follows , which again shows a resonance - type behavior with a tuning of noise .",
    "@xmath28,\\\\ \\bar{t_{n } } & = & \\phi ( n + \\sigma \\xi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the parameters , and @xmath31 is a function that gives the closest integer to @xmath32 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath10 is the same noise term as in the first model and its width is controlled by @xmath14 , and @xmath33 is a",
    " threshold function \" ( figure 2(a ) ) such that , @xmath34 in this model , we further need to define @xmath35 , which is given as follows .",
    "@xmath36     with parameters as examples of simulations presented in this paper .",
    "( a ) threshold function .",
    "the straight line has slope of @xmath37 .",
    "( b ) negative feedback function with parameters @xmath38 .",
    "straight line has slope of @xmath39 . ]",
    "the meaning of this definition is that when @xmath9 is in the past ( @xmath40 ) , the value of @xmath1 at that past point is used .",
    "one the other hand , if @xmath9 is in the future ( @xmath41 ) , we estimate @xmath1 as the value that would be obtained if the same rate of current change extends to the time duration from the present to the future point .",
    "qualitatively , this method of projecting into the future is one of the most commonly used for estimating population and national debt , for instance .",
    "the same estimation is used for the recent study in `` predictive dynamical systems''@xcite .",
    "the computer simulation of this model is performed with various parameter sets , examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "3 . without noise",
    "( @xmath17 ) , the basic dynamics are decaying to the origin , @xmath42 . with the introduction of noise with an increasing width , we begin to observe more rhythmic behaviors .",
    "this is seen with the peaks of the power spectrum .",
    "the signal to noise ratio , calculated as the ratio of the peak to the background height level of the power spectrum , is the main characterization of the stochastic resonance .    , @xmath43 , and the noise widths @xmath14",
    "are set to ( a ) @xmath44 , ( b ) @xmath45 , ( c ) @xmath46 , ( d ) @xmath47 , and ( e ) @xmath48 .",
    "the simulation is performed up to @xmath23 steps 20 averages are taken for the power spectrum . the unit of frequency @xmath24 is set as @xmath25 , and the power @xmath26 is in arbitrary units .",
    "graph ( f ) is the signal to noise ratio @xmath49 at the peak height as a function of the noise width @xmath14 . ]",
    "if we plot this as a function of the noise strength , we can obtain the resonance curve shown in figure 3f .",
    "this indicates that this signal to noise ratio goes through maximum at the optimal noise level with other parameters fixed .",
    "therefore , once again , the time fluctuation is acting in a constructive way .",
    "we would now like to discuss a couple of points with these models .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that , in these models , the basic flow and/or `` arrow '' of time is the same as in ordinary dynamical equations . in other words ,",
    "the rate of change of the dynamical variable @xmath50 is dictated by stochastically chosen point @xmath9 on the time axis , but the ordering of @xmath50 is kept by @xmath11 . from another point of view , these models can be considered a stochastic extension of the combined delayed@xcite and predictive@xcite dynamical systems .",
    "thus , the stochastic nature of time is only partially implemented here .",
    "we now turn our attention to the second type of models , in which the noise is in the time flow itself .",
    "there are several ways to achieve this effect .",
    "the discussion here is limited with a stochastic time flow combined with a delayed dynamics .",
    "the general form of the dynamical equation is given as follows .",
    "@xmath51 where @xmath4 is again a stochastic variable .",
    "it should be noted that we now have a stochasticity in time flow . in particular , we focus on the following corresponding map .",
    "@xmath52 here , @xmath10 is the stochastic variable which can take either @xmath53 or @xmath54 with certain probabilities .",
    "thus even though the dynamics progress by iteration of @xmath11 , it occasionally `` goes back in time '' with the occurrence of @xmath55 .",
    "let the probability of @xmath55 be given by @xmath56 .",
    "then naturally , with @xmath57 , this map reduces to a normal delayed map .",
    "the dynamical function is chosen to be a negative feedback function ( figure 2(b ) ) and the concrete map model we study is given as follows .",
    "@xmath58    when there is no noise in time flow , this map has the origin as the stable fixed point with no delay .",
    "the linear stability analysis gives the critical delay @xmath59 , at which the stability of the fixed point is lost , as @xmath60 .",
    "the larger delay gives an oscillatory dynamical path .",
    "we have found , through computer simulations , that an interesting behavior arises when delay is smaller than this critical delay .",
    "the tuned noise in the time flow gives the system more tendency for oscillatory behavior .",
    "in other words , adjusting the value of @xmath56 controlling @xmath10 induces oscillatory behaviors .",
    "some examples are shown in figure 4 . with increasing probability for a time flow to reverse ,",
    "i.e. , with @xmath56 increasing , we observe oscillatory behaviors as shown both in the sample dynamical path as well as in the corresponding power spectrum . however , with @xmath56 increased enough , the oscillatory behaviors begins to deteriorate .",
    "the change of the peak heights is shown in figure 5 .",
    "again , we see a phenomena which resembles stochastic resonance . a resonance with delay and noise , called `` delayed stochastic resonance''@xcite , has been proposed with an additive noise in `` space '' .",
    "analytical understanding of the mechanism of our model here is yet to be explored .",
    "however , this mechanism with stochastic time flow is clearly of different type and new .     of stochastic time flow varied .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the stochastic time flow parameter @xmath56 are set to ( a ) @xmath57 , ( b ) @xmath63 , ( c ) @xmath64 , ( d ) @xmath65 , and ( e ) @xmath66 .",
    "the simulation is performed up to @xmath67 steps and 20 averages are taken for the power spectrum .",
    "the unit of frequency @xmath24 is set as @xmath25 , and the power @xmath26 is in arbitrary units . ]     at the peak height as a function of the probability @xmath56 of stochastic time flow .",
    "the parameter settings are the same as in the figure 4 with the delay varied as ( a ) @xmath68 , ( b ) @xmath62 and ( c ) @xmath69 . ]",
    "we would like to now discuss a couple of points with respect to these models .",
    "first , we can extend these models to include fluctuations in the variable @xmath50 . proceeding in this way",
    ", we have a picture of dynamical systems with fluctuations on both the time and space axes . the analytical frameworks and tools for such descriptions need to be developed along with a search for appropriate applications . for an example of appropriate applications",
    ", we may think of modeling a stick balancing on a human fingertip .",
    "recent experiments have found that most of the corrective motion observed has shorter time scales compared to the human reaction time@xcite .",
    "this may be the result of intricate mixtures of physiological delays , predictions , and physical fluctuations .",
    "models incorporating special fluctuations and delays have been considered , but bringing in the effect from both the past and future through the stochastic time may help to further develop it .",
    "another direction may be to extend the path integral formalisms along this approach . whether this type of extension bridges into quantum pictures and/or leads to an alternative understanding of such properties as time - energy uncertainty relations requires further investigation .",
    "finally , if these models are capturing some aspects of reality , particularly with respect to stochasticity in time flow , this resonance may be used as an experimental indication for probing fluctuations or stochasticity in time .",
    "we have previously proposed `` delayed stochastic resonance''@xcite , a resonance by the interplay of noise and delay .",
    "it was theoretically extended@xcite , and recently the effect was experimentally observed through a solid - sate laser system with a feedback loop@xcite .",
    "it is left for the future to see if an analogous experimental test could be developed with respect to stochastic time ."
