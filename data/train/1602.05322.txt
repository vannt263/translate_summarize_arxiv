    "ever since the top quark discovery in @xmath6 collisions in 1995 by the cdf @xcite and d0 experiments @xcite at the fermilab tevatron , it has been in or near the center of attention in high - energy physics .",
    "its characteristics such as its mass @xmath7 , total decay width @xmath8 , branching fractions , and elements @xmath9 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix , have not yet been determined precisely .",
    "its property which is likely most central in many aspects of top physics is its mass .",
    "since , for example , the top interacts with the higgs boson through the potential @xmath10 where @xmath11 is proportional to the top mass @xmath7 , therefore the top mass has a fundamental role in the issue of stability of the higgs potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ hasan ] ) ) . using the full sample of @xmath6 collision data collected by the @xmath12 experiment in the tevatron run ii @xcite at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath13  tev and for an integrated luminosity of up to @xmath14  @xmath15",
    "the mass of top quark is measured as @xmath16  gev . due to its remarkably large mass , the top couples strongly to the agents of electroweak symmetry breaking and",
    "this makes it both an object of interest itself , and a tool to investigate that mechanism in detail .",
    "+ among other things , the cern lhc is a genuine top factory , in particular in run ii , producing about 90 million top quark pairs per year of running at design energy @xmath17  tev .",
    "the existing and upcoming data will allow us to study the top quark and its behavior in lhc collisions in great detail , if also the theoretical descriptions and simulations are of proportionate quality .",
    "+ the top decay width itself is very difficult to determine in hadron colliders , though a recent experimental inference of the width was performed by d0 @xcite and found @xmath18  gev in the context of single top t - channel production , and cdf @xcite also reported @xmath19  gev at the @xmath20 confidence level .",
    "the top decay characteristics play an important role in studying the top quark at colliders . since , the width - to - mass ratio @xmath21 of the top quark is small enough then , for many purpose , the notion of top quark as a stable particle makes sense , so that its production and decay processes can be factorized through the narrow width approximation @xcite .",
    "in fact , if it were not for the confinement of color , the top could be considered as a free particle .",
    "this property allows it to behave like a real particle and one can safely describe its decay in perturbative theory .",
    "+ the top decay width is largely due to decays to a w - boson and a bottom quark ( with the mass @xmath22 ) , as it is represented in the element @xmath23 of the ckm matrix @xcite . since @xmath24 ,",
    "its width is sufficiently large to pre - empt top quark hadronization , then this rapid decay ( @xmath25  s @xcite ) enables transmission of top quark spin information to final states .",
    "part of the top attractiveness is its power to self - analyze its spin , through its purely left - handed standard model ( sm ) weak decay .",
    "the interplay between the top spin and its mass is of crucial importance in studying the sm .",
    "the top quark polarization can be studied by the angular correlations between the top quark spin and its decay product momenta , and these spin - momentum correlations will allow the detailed studies of the top decay mechanism . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that these correlations depend on the choice of the possible helicity coordinate systems .",
    "+ since , produced b - quarks hadronize before they decay , then each @xmath26-jet contains a bottom flavored hadron which , most of the times , is a b - meson .",
    "they are identified by a displaced decay vertex associated which charged lepton tracks . in @xcite",
    ", it is identified that the hadronization of the b - quark is the largest source of uncertainty in the measurement of the top mass at the lhc and the tevatron .",
    "these nonperturbative transitions are described by realistic , nonperturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) that are usually obtained through a global fit to @xmath5 data . at lhc ,",
    "the decay process @xmath27 is of prime importance , and it is an urgent task to predict its partial decay width as reliably as possible , specifically the distribution in the scaled - energy of b - mesons ( @xmath28 ) in the top quark rest frame is of particular interest .",
    "these @xmath28-distributions provide direct access to the b - meson ffs . in @xcite , using the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) in which the mass of b - quarks are set to zero at the parton - level , we studied the nlo angular distribution of the scaled - energy of b - hadrons through polarized top decays . for that , we calculated the polar angular correlation in the rest frame decay of a polarized top quark into a stable @xmath29-boson and the b - hadron , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "we analysed this correlation in a helicity coordinate system where the event plane , including the top quark and its decay products , is defined in the @xmath31-plane with the z - axes along the b - quark momentum . here ,",
    "the top polarization vector was evaluated with respect to the b - momentum direction . + here , using the same frame , we revisit b - hadron production from polarized top decays by working at nlo in the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) , where b - quark masses are preserved from the beginning . this makes the calculations more complicated .",
    "being manifestly based on collin s qcd factorization theorem @xcite convenient for massive quarks , this factorization scheme allows us to resum the large logarithms in @xmath22 , to retain the finite-@xmath22 effects and to preserve the universality of the ffs , whose scaling violations remain to be subject to dglap evolution @xcite . in this way",
    ", it combines the virtues of the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) and the zm - vfn scheme and also avoids their flaws .",
    "in fact , it is an elaborat tool for global analyses of experimental data on the inclusive production of heavy flavored hadrons , allowing one to transfer nonperturbative information on the hadronization of partons from one type of experiment to another and from one energy scale @xmath32 to another , without the restriction @xmath33 which is essential for the zm - vfns .",
    "our analysis is supposed to enhance our previous result @xcite in the zm - vfn scheme by retaining all nonlogarithmic @xmath22-terms .",
    "+ moreover , we also include finite-@xmath34 effects , which modify the relations between hadronic and partonic scaling variables and reduce the available phase space .",
    "however , due to the smallness @xmath35 , we do not expect to measure these additional effects truly , except for certain corners the phase space .",
    "their study is nevertheless necessary to fully exploit the enormous statistics of the lhc data to be taken in the long run for a high precision determination of the top properties .",
    "studying top decays could be important to deepen our conception of the nonperturbative aspects of b - mesons formation and to test the universality and scaling violations of the b - meson ffs .",
    "at first , we briefly review the various interactions of the top quark field @xmath36 in the sm lagrangian ; a topic needed for the calculation of top decay widths . +",
    "the charged weak interaction of the top quark is left - handed and flavor - changing , so expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 stands for the fields of _ down _ , _ strange _ and _ bottom _ quarks and the weak coupling factor @xmath39 is related to the fermi coupling constant as @xmath40 , while its neutral weak interaction is flavor - conserving and parity violating @xmath41t(x ) z_\\mu(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the weak mixing angle , so that @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "its interaction with gluons is a vector - like coupling , involving an su(3 ) generator ( @xmath44 ) in the fundamental representation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath47 is the qcd color index so @xmath48 . the top interaction with photons is also simply vector - like as @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is proportional to the top quark electric charge .",
    "+ finally , the interaction of the top quark with the higgs field @xmath50 is of the yukawa type @xmath51 with a coupling constant @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the yukawa coupling is almost @xmath54 in the sm .",
    "+ in many extensions of the sm such as minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the higgs sector of the sm is enlarged by considering an extra doublet of complex higgs field @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we studied the top decay in the general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "+ moreover , beyond the interactions above , effective interactions such as for flavor - changing neutral currents occur due to loop corrections . however , they are generally very small in comparison with those above .",
    "all these interactions could be modified in structure and strength by virtual effects due to new interactions associated with the physics beyond the sm .",
    "this is of interest to investigate that if the top quark , evidently , has a large coupling to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "therefore , it is so important to test these structures in detail , and indeed this is the thrust behind the field of top physics .",
    "+ one proposed way to study the properties of top quarks is to consider the scaled - energy distribution of outgoing hadrons . in next section",
    "we shall study this approach in detail , using the gm - vfn scheme where the mass of b - quark is preserved from the beginning .",
    "we consider the decay process of polarized on - shell top quark at nlo , as @xmath55 where , @xmath56 stands for the unobserved final - state particles .",
    "we wish to study the angular distribution of the scaled - energy of b - hadrons by considering the contribution of bottom and gluon fragmentations into the heavy meson b , so that the gluon contributes to the real radiation at nlo . to obtain this energy spectrum",
    ", we need to have the parton - level differential width of the process ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the lo contribution results from @xmath57 .",
    "we define the partonic scaled - energy fraction @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for the gluon or bottom quark momenta . in the top quark rest frame",
    "where @xmath60 , one has @xmath61 where @xmath62 refers to the energy of outgoing partons ; gluon or bottom at nlo . by preserving the bottom quark mass , one has @xmath63 in which @xmath64 and @xmath65 . as in @xcite , throughout this paper , we shall make use of the normalized energy fraction of partons as @xmath66 the allowed values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 shall be discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we analyse the decay @xmath57 in the rest frame of the top quark where the 3-momentum of the b - quark points to the direction of the positive z - axis . for a polarized top quark ,",
    "the general angular distribution of differential decay width @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 this form clarifies the correlations between the top decay products and the spin of the top quark .",
    "+ in ( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath71 is the magnitude of the top - quark polarization with @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 corresponds to an unpolarized top quark and @xmath74 is for the @xmath75 polarization . here , @xmath76 is defined as the polar angle between the top quark polarization vector @xmath77 and the z - axis ( b - quark momentum direction ) .",
    "+ in ( [ eq6 ] ) , @xmath78 refers to the unpolarized differential widths which studied in @xcite , both in zm- and gm - vfn schemes . in following ,",
    "we discuss the evaluation of the quantities @xmath79 in the gm - vfn scheme .",
    "considering the charged weak interaction lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) , the dynamics of the current - induced @xmath80 transition is presented in the tensor @xmath81 in which the weak current is @xmath82 , and at the born level and @xmath83 one - loop contributions the intermediate state is @xmath84 . also , this hadronic tensor depends on the top spin @xmath85 .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the born term contribution to the decay ( [ eq3 ] ) . in the top rest frame ,",
    "the four - momentum of the bottom quark is set to @xmath86 and the polarization four - vector of the top quark is set as @xmath87 .",
    "considering the general distribution ( [ eq6 ] ) , the born term helicity structure of partial rates , reads @xmath88 where , the lo polarized ( @xmath89 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath90 ) total decay widths read @xmath91 here , we used the following kinematic variables , in the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath92 in the limit of vanishing bottom quark mass , the tree - level decay widths converted to our results in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the qcd one - loop vertex corrections arise from the emission and absorption of the virtual gluons , so an interaction lagrangian as in ( [ eq2 ] ) is needed to calculate the virtual radiative corrections . here",
    ", we adopt the on - shell mass renormalization scheme and use dimensional regularization to regulate the ultraviolate ( uv ) and soft singularities which appear in one - loop corrections .",
    "for example , the uv - singularities appear when the integration region of the internal momentum of the virtual gluon goes to infinity .",
    "the singularities are regularized by dimensional regularization in @xmath93 space - time dimensions to become single poles in @xmath94 , so that @xmath95 . in the massless case ,",
    "all singularities are subtracted at factorization scale @xmath32 and absorbed into the bare ffs in accordance with the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath96 ) scheme , see @xcite . in the massive case , all singularities are automatically canceled after summing all radiative corrections up .",
    "+ considering the notations ( [ variable ] ) , the contribution of virtual corrections into the doubly differential decay width ( [ eq6 ] ) is obtained as @xmath97 where @xmath98 stands for the born term amplitude and the renormalized amplitude @xmath99 refers to the virtual gluon corrections , presented in @xcite .",
    "the virtual contributions include the counterterm and the one - loop vertex corrections .",
    "the counterterm of the vertex contains the wave - function renormalization constants of the top ( @xmath100 ) and the bottom quark ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "these constants can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ the wave - function renormalization and the one - loop vertex correction contain the uv and infrared ( ir ) singularities so that all uv - divergences are canceled after summing all virtual corrections up and , from now on , we label the remaining ir - singularities by @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the virtual decay width is given by @xmath102 where the unpolarized differential decay rate reads @xmath103 and the polarized one is expressed by @xmath104 where , @xmath105 in the equations above , @xmath106 is the color factor , @xmath107 is the euler constant , @xmath108 is the dilogarithmic function ( or spence function ) and the term @xmath109 includes the ir - singularity ( @xmath94 ) as @xmath110 here , @xmath32 stands for the factorization scale which will be removed after summing all corrections up in the gm - vfn scheme .",
    "the @xmath83 real graph contributions result from the real gluon emissions from the bottom and top quarks , individually . in the rest frame of a top quark decaying into a b - quark , a @xmath29 boson and a gluon",
    ", the outgoing particles define an event plane .",
    "relative to this plane one can , then , define the spin direction of the polarized top quark . as in @xcite",
    ", here we apply a specific helicity coordinate system where the momenta of the b - quark and the @xmath29 boson are defined as ; @xmath111 , and the polarization vector of top quark is evaluated relative to the @xmath112-axis . in the following ,",
    "we explain a brief technical detail of our calculation for the nlo radiative corrections to the tree - level decay rate of @xmath113 .    in @xcite , where we set the mass of b - quark to zero from the first , the ir - singularities arised from the soft- and collinear gluon emissions .",
    "since , here , we preserve the mass of b - quark then all ir - singularities arise from the soft real - gluon emission and the collinear divergences would be absent .",
    "as before , to regularize the ir - singularities we work in d - dimensions where the real differential rate is given by @xmath114 to compute the differential rate @xmath115 , we fix the b - quark momentum and integrate over the gluon energy which ranges from @xmath116 to @xmath117 . in the gm - vfn scheme",

    "[ fig3 ] , for a quantitative comparison of our previous predictions @xcite at nlo in the zm - vfn scheme , we consider the gm - vfn result ( @xmath200 ) including finite-@xmath34 corrections without @xmath194 fragmentation ( solid line ) and the full gm - vfn result ( dot - dashed line ) using eq.([convolute2 ] ) , both normalized to the full zm - vfn result for @xmath172 .",
    "it is observed that the omission of @xmath194 fragmentation causes an excess by a factor of up to @xmath201 close to threshold , while the finite-@xmath22 and @xmath34 corrections amount less .",
    "note that , our most reliable prediction for the energy spectrum of b - meson is made at nlo in the gm - vfn scheme by including finite-@xmath34 corrections .",
    "relative to our previous work the improvements in our new work is twofold .",
    "first , the finite-@xmath34 corrections are responsible for the appearance of the threshold at @xmath202 , and second , the finite-@xmath22 corrections lead to a moderate reduction in size throughout the whole @xmath28 range allowed , specially in the peak range .",
    ".  [ ratio ] , to study the angular dependence of energy distributions we plot the ratio of the nlo unpolarized @xcite and polarized results for the @xmath203 in the gm - vfn ( @xmath2 ) scheme including finite-@xmath34 corrections .",
    "@xmath204 as a function of @xmath28 at nlo in the gm - vfn ( @xmath2 ) scheme including finite-@xmath34 corrections by using eq.([convolute2 ] ) .",
    "the nlo prediction ( solid line ) is compared to the lo one ( dot - dashed line ) and broken up into the contributions due to @xmath189 ( dotted line ) and @xmath194 ( dashed line ) fragmentation . ]",

    "for comparison , also the gm - vfn result excluding @xmath194 fragmentation is shown ( solid line ) .",

    "studying the fundamental properties of the top quark is an object of interest in theoretical and experimental particle physics . among other things ,",
    "the lhc is a superlative top factory which allows one to study the top characteristics in great detail , if also the theoretical descriptions and simulations are of commensurate quality . in particular ,",
    "the lhc will allow for the study of the dominant decay mode @xmath205 with unprecedented precision in the long run .",
    "as an application , these studies will enable us to deepen our conception of the nonperturbative aspects of b - hadron formation by hadronization and to pin down the @xmath189 and @xmath194 fragmentation functions .",
    "the key quantity for this purpose is the @xmath28 distribution @xmath165 of @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , the distributions in the scaled b - hadron energy @xmath28 through the polarized ( [ eq3 ] ) or unpolarized @xcite top decays are of particular interest at the lhc . in this context",
    ", recently , the local cms group at the cern lhc started to work on a determination of the top quark mass from a detailed study of the b - meson decays .",
    "+ the top quark decays rapidly so that has no enough time to hadronize and then passes on its full spin information to its decay products .",
    "this allows one to study the top spin state using the angular distributions of its decay products , so that , in this work we studied the @xmath83 spin - dependent energy spectrum of hadrons produced from polarized top quark decays . for this , we studied the observable @xmath165 at nlo in the gm - vfn scheme @xcite . this allowed us to investigate , for the first time , finite-@xmath22 corrections to the @xmath165 .",
    "we also analyzed the size of finite-@xmath34 effects .",
    "specifically , our analysis is supposed to enhance our previous results presented in @xcite by retaining all nonlogarithmic @xmath22 terms of the result in the ffn scheme .",
    "these studies are mandatory in order to fully exploit the enormous statistics of the lhc data to be taken in the long run for a high - precision determination of the top - quark properties . + comparing future measurements of the polarized width @xmath207 at the lhc with our nlo predictions",
    ", one will be also able to test the universality and scaling violations of the b - hadron ffs .",
    "these measurements of the @xmath28 distributions will ultimately be the primary source of information on the b - hadron ffs .",
    "+ our formalism elaborated here is also applicable to the production of hadron species other than b - hadrons , such as pions , kaons and protons , etc . , using the @xmath208 ffs presented in our recent paper @xcite , relying on their universality and scaling violations .",
