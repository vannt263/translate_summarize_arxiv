    "the origin of ultra high - energy ( @xmath7  ev ) cosmic - rays ( uhecrs ) remains a mystery @xcite .",
    "the sources have not been robustly identified , and the models of particle acceleration are challenged by the fact that the energy spectrum extends to @xmath8  ev .",
    "several observational clues suggest that the uhecr flux is dominated by extra - galactic light nuclei : the spectrum flattens at @xmath9  ev @xcite , there is evidence for a composition change from heavy to light nuclei at @xmath9  ev @xcite , and the uhecr arrival direction distribution is nearly isotropic @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of a weak anisotropy in the arrival distribution of @xmath10  ev cosmic - rays @xcite , is consistent with that predicted by assuming that the spatial distribution of uhecr sources correlates with the large - scale distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the identity of the uhecr particles is uncertain , we will assume here that they are protons .",
    "this assumption is motivated by two arguments .",
    "first , the observed spectrum of cosmic - rays with energies @xmath7  ev is consistent with a cosmological distribution of proton accelerators producing ( intrinsically ) a power - law spectrum of high energy protons with @xmath11 , for the number @xmath12 as a function of energy @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this intrinsic power - law spectrum is consistent with that expected in models of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks , for both non - relativistic  @xcite and relativistic shocks ( waxman 2006 ; see however keshet 2006 ) .",
    "second , the leading candidates for extra - galactic sources , namely gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei ( see below ) , are expected to accelerate primarily protons .",
    "robust model - independent considerations imply that uhecr protons can only be produced by sources with an exceedingly high power output @xcite , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the lorentz factor and characteristic velocity associated with plasma motions within the source below . ] .",
    "since no steady source above this power threshold is known to exist within the 100  mpc _ gzk horizon _ , the distance to which the propagation of @xmath0  ev protons is limited by their interaction with the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the uhecr sources are most likely transient . a possible alternative is , of course , an unknown class of `` dark sources '' , which produce little radiation and therefore remain undetectable by telescopes",
    ".    only two types of sources are known to satisfy the above minimum power requirement : active galactic nuclei ( agn )  the brightest known steady sources , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )  the brightest known transient sources .",
    "the absence of agn with @xmath17 within the gzk horizon had motivated @xcite to suggest that uhecrs may be produced by a new , yet undetected , class of short duration agn flares resulting from the tidal disruption of stars or accretion disk instabilities .",
    "we show in   [ sec : flares ] that if electrons are accelerated together with the protons in uhecr - producing flares , then their radiative losses will produce a bright flare of x - ray and @xmath2-ray photons .",
    "we then show in   [ sec : lfs ] that existing x - ray and @xmath2-ray surveys already put stringent constraints on the properties of uhecr flares . in ",
    "[ sec : hidden ] we discuss the possibility of `` hiding '' the x - ray emission .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .    throughout our discussion",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the flare is associated with ejection of magnetized plasma from the source , and where the charged particles are accelerated within the magnetized outflow .",
    "the non thermal emission from a wide range of sources is described within the framework of such a scenario .",
    "this includes agn jets and grbs , as well as the transient agn flares proposed by @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the uhecr flares by their power , @xmath18 , duration , @xmath19 , characteristic ejection speed @xmath16 , and rate per unit volume in the local universe , @xmath20 .",
    "the fractions of the total energy output carried by protons , electrons and magnetic fields are denoted by @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and we assume that the energy spectrum of accelerated electrons is similar to that of accelerated protons with a power - law index , @xmath11 .",
    "this index is expected for astrophysical sources which accelerate particles in strong collisionless shocks @xcite , and is inferred from the radiation observed from a variety of high energy sources , such as supernova remnants @xcite and grbs @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the composition of the jets of high energy sources is unknown .",
    "two classes of models are generally discussed : jets where the energy flux is dominated by the plasma kinetic energy , and jets where most of the energy is carried by electromagnetic flux . for the `` kinetic '' jets , a plausible mechanism exists for energy dissipation , particle acceleration and radiation emission , namely internal collisionless shocks within the outflow . within this mechanism , a particle distribution following @xmath11 is naturally expected . for the `` electromagnetic '' jets ,",
    "the mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration is not well understood .",
    "we will assume that a @xmath11 particle distribution is generated in this model too , as suggested by observations .",
    "as explained at the end of   [ sec : rates ] , our conclusions are valid for both spherical and jetted flows . throughout the paper",
    ", @xmath18 stands for the `` isotropic - equivalent power '' ( i.e. for a flow which is conical rather than spherical , @xmath18 stands for the power that would have been carried by the flow had it been spherically symmetric ) , and @xmath20 stands for the `` isotropic - equivalent rate density '' ( i.e. the rate inferred under the assumption of spherically symmetric emission ) .",
    "we define a transient source to have an active phase of duration @xmath19 shorter than the time delay @xmath24 between the photon and the uhecr arrival times . with this definition ,",
    "a `` steady '' source is one which is still active when the uhecrs from it are being detected .",
    "the arrival time delay originates from deflections of the charged uhecrs by intergalactic magnetic fields , and can be expressed in terms of the deflection angle , @xmath25 , and propagation distance , @xmath26 , as @xmath27 .",
    "the deflection angle is limited to @xmath28 ( see detailed discussion in  2.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore @xmath29 for transient sources , the apparent number density of uhecr sources is energy dependent and given by @xmath30 .",
    "the required number density of active flares is obtained from the observed energy production rate of uhecr protons per comoving volume , @xmath31 @xcite , giving @xmath32 where , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the total energy output in protons , and @xmath36 is the energy production per logarithmic proton energy ( @xmath13 ) interval in the observed energy range . for the acceleration spectrum of strong collisionless shocks , @xmath37",
    ", we get @xmath38 and so @xmath39 .",
    "the flare duration is limited by the absence of uhecr sources with multiple events , the so - called ` repeaters ' .",
    "the absence of repeaters sets a lower limit on the number density of sources , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this can be derived by noting that the nearly isotropic distribution of the @xmath41 _ auger _ events of energy @xmath10  ev requires tens of sources to be active within @xmath42  mpc ( the propagation distance of protons with energies @xmath10  ev ) within _ auger _",

    "the photon luminosity per logarithmic frequency ( @xmath51 ) interval is then @xmath52 , where the factor of 2 is introduced since typically @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that the number density of active photon flares with a luminosity @xmath54 is @xmath55 where @xmath56 .    requiring that the acceleration time @xmath57 be smaller than the plasma expansion time @xmath58 and the proton energy loss time @xmath59 , sets lower limits on @xmath18 and the outflow lorentz factor , @xmath15 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we briefly describe these limits and derive the implied constraints on the photon luminosity . assuming that acceleration results from electromagnetic processes within the outflowing plasma , the acceleration time must exceed the larmor gyration time of the accelerated particle is larger than the larmor time by a factor @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the shock velocity in the plasma rest frame .",

    "the minimum photon luminosity is therefore @xmath71 one of our primary objectives is to demonstrate that exceptionally powerful flares with @xmath72 are required . in what follows we limit the discussion to flares with @xmath73 , since a higher @xmath15 implies @xmath74 .",
    "a lower limit on the bulk lorentz factor @xmath15 is set by requiring that the synchrotron loss time would exceed the acceleration time , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the proton and electron masses .",
    "using @xmath78 , this condition implies @xcite @xmath79 or numerically , @xmath80 hereafter , we drop the dependence on @xmath81 since the flow is required to be at least mildly relativistic with @xmath82 . combining this result with eq .",
    "( [ eq : l_bmin ] ) , we get @xmath83    the constraints on @xmath18 and @xmath15 are the same for a spherical and conical ( jet - like ) outflow as long as the opening angle of the jet @xmath84 is larger than @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "thus , the constraints in equations  ( [ eq : l_bmin])([eq : l_bmin1 ] ) apply in both cases , provided that @xmath18 is interpreted as the isotropic - equivalent power . in the case of jets",
    ", there could be a discrepancy between the apparent number of uhecr sources and photon sources , in case the deflection angle of crs by the intergalactic magnetic field is larger than @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "for the lorentz factors considered here , @xmath73 , the magnetic deflections are smaller than @xmath87 ( see the opening paragraph of this section ) , implying that we should see the same sources in both photons and uhecrs . under these circumstances , the results in equations  ( [ eq : n_lim])([eq : n_phot_flares ] ) hold , provided that @xmath40 and @xmath20 refer to the isotropic equivalents quantities .",
    "this also implies that we can use isotropic equivalent luminosities in the luminosity functions .",
    "we next show that our estimate of the photon luminosity , @xmath88 , is valid for photon energies above @xmath89  kev .",
    "we start our discussion by justifying the fast cooling assumption for the electrons .",
    "if electrons are accelerated through a process similar to that of the protons , their acceleration time to a given energy would be similar to that of the protons .",
    "the maximum electron energy would be lower than that of the protons , owing to their higher cooling rate . equating the electron acceleration time to the radiative cooling time , @xmath90 , yields @xmath91 . here",

    "however , the x - ray luminosity is expected to be comparable to @xmath110 also for @xmath108 well above the x - ray band , owing to electron cooling .",

    "the luminosity is @xmath111 at @xmath112 , and the cooling electrons would produce a luminosity @xmath113 at @xmath114 .",
    "this implies a hard x - ray luminosity , in the 10100kev band , of @xmath115 , which is comparable to @xmath110 .    by specifying the acceleration mechanism",
    ", we may derive an estimate for @xmath108 .",
    "if the wind power is carried by the kinetic energy of the outflowing plasma and the plasma is heated through internal shocks ( which also accelerate particles ) within the outflow , then the characteristic temperature of the protons is @xmath116 .",
    "this follows from the fact that relative motions within the plasma rest frame are expected to be mildly , but not highly , relativistic .",

    "however , such a scenario is unnatural since it requires two coincidences : the flares must become a dominant source of energy output only at @xmath204 ( or else they would modify the observed lf evolution at lower @xmath151 ) , and exist only at @xmath153 ( or else we would observe them at @xmath205 ) .",
