    "<S> the descripition of in a hermitian setting seemingly nonlocal and nonperturbative phenomena like confinement or superconductivity is most conveniently performed by generalizing quantum theory to a non - hermitian regime where these phenomena appear perturbative and local . </S>",
    "<S> the short presentation provides a clue how this can be done on the basis of lorentz covariance while preserving the analyticity of the theory . after deriving with the help of lorentz covariance a quantum scalar product without making any use of metric or complex conjugation we sketch how the formalism of scattering theory can be extended analytically to a non - hermitian regime . </S>"
