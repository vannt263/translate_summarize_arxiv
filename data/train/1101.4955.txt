    "the study of radiative transfer and its interaction with matter has an extremely wide range of applications ranging from medical imagery to astrophysics . in many cases , as for example in stellar atmospheres , the radiation is considered as a physical probe which provides access to the thermodynamical properties of the flow through the spectrum of emission and absorption lines .",
    "however , the radiation often has a very important dynamical role in the system .",
    "it can not only be considered as a passive probe , but as an integral part of the equations governing the system dynamics .",
    "the equation of radiative transfer ( ignoring scattering ) is @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the specific intensity of the radiation , @xmath3 the frequency , @xmath4 is the speed of light , @xmath5 the absorption / emission coefficient and @xmath6 the black body specific intensity .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the angular , spatial and temporal variables , respectively . as the radiation intensity depends on seven variables in three - dimensions , solving the full transfer equation coupled to the hydrodynamics to tackle radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) problems is still out of reach of modern computational architectures , even with the remarkable and constant increase in computing power .    in order to overcome this difficulty , much effort has been spent in recent years developing mathematically less complicated , yet accurate approximations to the equations of radiative transfer .",
    "such approximations include diffusion approximations @xcite and moment models @xcite .",
    "all of these approximations use frequency and/or angle - integrated variables which greatly simplify the calculations .",
    "the approximations due to the angular integration have been widely studied ( see for example @xcite ) . however , in many situations , the quantities involved in the equations of radiative transfer ( in particular the absorption and scattering coefficients ) depend strongly on frequency , and the so called ` grey ' approximation ( integrated over all frequencies ) is no longer appropriate . only very recently have models which take into account variations in frequency been developed @xcite .",
    "the common practise is to split the frequency domain into a finite number of bins or groups and the equations of radiative transfer are solved within each group ; this is known as a multigroup method .",
    "such a scheme is then capable of allowing for gas opacity variations in the frequency domain providing a more accurate description of radiative transfer processes .",
    "the model we present in this paper is an extension of the moment model introduced in @xcite which couples the frequency - dependent radiation to the hydrodynamics .",
    "moment models are obtained by computing successive angular moments of the radiative transfer equation .",
    "one obtains a hierarchy of equations for moments of the specific intensity .",
    "basically , each equation describes the evolution of the n@xmath10 moment as a function of the divergence of the ( n+1)@xmath10 moment .",
    "for instance , the equations giving the evolution of the first two moments are @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are , respectively , the radiative energy density , the radiative energy flux , and the radiative pressure , which are defined in terms of the zeroth , first and second moments of the specific intensity as @xmath14    the transfer equation is formally equivalent to an infinite hierarchy of moment equations . in order to have a tractable moment model",
    ", one must cut this hierarchy at some given order . a closure relation",
    "is then needed in order to express the moment of highest order as a function of the others .    in this paper , we develop for the first time the coupling of the @xmath0 moment model for radiative transfer to the hydrodynamics to create a multigroup model for rhd .",
    "a finite volume method used to compute the additional terms due to frequency variations is described .",
    "we then present a series of tests for the multigroup model studying first the radiative transfer alone and then the radiation coupled to the hydrodynamics .",
    "the strengths and future developments of the model are finally discussed .",
    "the equations of radiation hydrodynamics describe the effects of radiative transfer on a moving fluid . the fluid evolution is determined by the classical conservation equations ( mass , momentum , and energy ) which are coupled to the radiative transfer equations ( [ eq : evolrad ] ) through source terms characterizing the momentum and energy exchanges between the fluid and the radiation .    in order to write the rhd equations",
    ", one has to choose the frame in which to evaluate the radiative quantities : laboratory frame or comoving frame ( i.e. the frame moving with the fluid ) .",
    "the laboratory frame is convenient because the the left - hand side of the system remains hyperbolic and thus globally conservative @xcite .",
    "however in this frame , interactions with matter become complex because of doppler and aberration effects that have to be incorporated in the source terms . on the other hand , using the radiative quantities expressed in the comoving frame @xcite adds non - conservative terms to the equations , and conversions of the radiative quantities between comoving and lab frames are required in order to be compared to observations as any measurement will almost certainly be carried out in the lab frame .",
    "however the source terms coupling matter and radiation remain unaffected by the fluid motions .",
    "we have chosen to express radiative quantities in the comoving frame for the greater simplicity of the source terms .",
    "the equations of non - relativistic rhd ( to order @xmath15 ) can then be written as @xcite @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gas density , @xmath19 the velocity , @xmath20 the total gas energy , @xmath21 the gas pressure , and @xmath22 is the third moment of the specific intensity @xmath23 the tensorial contractions are defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : hydro ] ) and ( [ eq : ray ] ) are all eulerian , but the radiative quantities are evaluated in the frame comoving with the fluid . in a grey model , system ( [ eq : ray ] )",
    "is integrated from 0 to @xmath26 in frequency and the terms involving frequency derivatives @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish .",
    "however , in a multigroup model these terms remain and are in fact of great importance ; they govern energy transfers between neighbouring groups .    in a multigroup model ,",
    "the frequency domain is divided into a finite number of bins or groups and the radiative transfer equations are integrated and solved within each group .",
    "the integrals in the source terms of the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : hydro ] ) then become sums of source terms over the total number of groups",
    ". systems ( [ eq : hydro ] ) and ( [ eq : ray ] ) become @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 with @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 which represent the radiative energy , flux , pressure and heat flux inside each group @xmath37 which holds frequencies between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the absorption coefficients @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the means of @xmath5 inside a given group weighted by the planck function , the radiative energy and the radiative flux respectively .    in order to integrate the previous system , it is necessary to introduce a closure relation giving @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath34 .",
    "the closure we have chosen is based on the @xmath47 model and is presented below .      the @xmath0 model @xcite uses the first two moment equations ( [ eq : evolrad ] ) to approximate the equation of radiative transfer .",
    "it has the great advantage over flux - limited diffusion models @xcite of being valid in both the diffusion and free - streaming limits while maintaining a directionality in the propagation of the radiation .",
    "shadows can be created with the @xmath0 method while flux - limited diffusion considers the radiative flux to always be colinear to the radiative temperature gradient , which can result in radiation propagating around corners @xcite .    in the @xmath0 model",
    "the radiative pressure is expressed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is known as the eddington tensor .",
    "the expression for @xmath49 is obtained by minimizing the radiative entropy which yields @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the ratio of the grey flux to the flux free - streaming limit , also known as the reduced flux .",
    "the quantities without the subscript @xmath3 represent quantities integrated over the entire frequency range .",
    "note that by definition of @xmath46 and @xmath34 , we have @xmath53 , which implies that the radiative energy is transported at most at the speed of light . in one dimension",

    "a natural way to extend this closure to a multigroup model would be to minimize the total radiative entropy , which is a rather complex procedure .",
    "however , @xcite has shown that applying inside each group a closure formally equivalent to the @xmath0 closure leads to almost indistinguishable results ; a strategy which we have therefore adopted for its greater simplicity .",
    "we define for each group the radiative pressure as @xmath74 where @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the heat flux @xmath78 is computed in the same manner .",
    "the only terms which were not included in our previous grey rhd models @xcite are the terms in ( [ eq : raymulti2 ] ) involving the frequency differentials . in order to evaluate these terms ,",
    "we adopt a finite volume method in the frequency dimension .",
    "we present here this method in the one - dimensional case , but its extension to several dimensions is trivial . retaining only the time and frequency derivatives of the radiative energy and flux equations of system ( [ eq : ray ] ) , we obtain @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "we now assume that the frequency group boundaries ( @xmath81 ) are equivalent to the volume elements boundaries in the frequency dimension .",
    "the finite volume discretization of ( [ eq : dnu ] ) gives @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the radiative pressures and heat flux evaluated at the group interfaces .",
    "the jacobian matrix @xmath85 of the hyperbolic system ( [ eq : dnu ] ) is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "it can be shown that the trace and the determinant of @xmath88 are both strictly positive .",
    "the eigenvalues of system ( [ eq : dnu ] ) are thus always of the same sign ( i.e. opposite to that of @xmath89 ) , which enables us to use a standard upwind scheme with respect to @xmath89 to calculate the values for @xmath35 and @xmath36 at the group interfaces .",
    "this yields @xmath90 where @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that the radiative energy and flux are advected from one group to the other depending on the sign of the velocity divergence .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the inclusion of these terms preserves the flux limitation condition @xmath93 as long as @xmath94 , which is always true ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) .",
    "it would of course be possible to use higher order schemes to evaluate the quantities at the group interfaces by computing slopes using the usual methods .",
    "for the sake of conciseness this will not be explicited here .",
    "in this section , we briefly present our global strategy to integrate the coupled rhd system ( [ eq : hydromulti])-([eq : raymulti2 ] ) ( the method is identical to the one reported in @xcite apart from the terms involving the frequency differentials which were not included ) . in order to have a tractable time step",
    ", the radiative transport needs to be treated implicitly .",
    "however , it is most of the time more efficient to retain an explicit scheme for the hydrodynamics .",
    "we therefore use the following splitting scheme .    in the first step the hydrodynamics system ( [ eq : hydromulti ] )",
    "is solved explicitly without the source terms .",
    "it is integrated using a classical second order muscl - hancock scheme . in the second step ,",

    "the terms in system ( [ eq : raymulti2 ] ) involving frequency derivatives are discretized as presented above and using the velocity divergence from the hydrodynamic solver .",
    "the velocity coming from the hydrodynamic solver is also used to discretize the other terms involving velocity derivatives . for the hyperbolic radiative term ( two first left hand - side terms of system ( [ eq : raymulti2 ] ) ) we use a hllc solver with an asymptotic preserving correction in order to recover properly the diffusion limit @xcite . system ( [ eq : raymulti2 ] ) is solved implicitly with the source terms of system ( [ eq : hydromulti ] ) using a raphson - newton procedure .",

    "we have tried this in one dimension and did not find any significant differences with the splitting scheme presented above .",
    "calculating @xmath68 and @xmath69 for every grid cell at every timestep is computationally demanding due to the presence of logarithm and power functions , and we have thus tabulated the functions using 100 points which are read in once by the code at the beginning of a run . a specific value of @xmath68 or @xmath69 is then found using a hermitian cubic spline interpolation which is very fast and accurate ; the errors between the interpolated and the true values are less than 0.01% throughout .    in this section",
    "we validate the method for multigroup rhd using a series of tests . for this purpose the numerical scheme skeched above have been implemented in a one - dimensional lagrangian hydrodynamic code .",
    "the boundary conditions are implemented using two ghost cells at the edges of the grid .",
    "these ghost cells are filled using various physical constraints such as null gradient , reflexive boundary or user imposed conditions .",
    "we use a step by step progression in our test sequence in order to verify each aspect of the method with increasingly complex problems .",
    "we first make sure that the multigroup transfer model ( no hydrodynamics included ) is equivalent to a grey model if the opacities are independent of frequency .",
    "we then test the multigroup aspect of the method with frequency dependent opacities .",

    "thirdly , we investigate the coupling of the radiative transfer to the gas motion using ` frozen hydrodynamics ' .",
    "finally , we perform full rhd tests .        our first test is to check that the multigroup model reduces to a grey @xmath0 model for a gas with a frequency - independent opacity .",

    "the curves representing the gas and radiative temperatures for the mono- and multigroup simulations were virtually indistinguishable and we show the percentage difference between them in the bottom panel .",
    "note that the differences remain below 0.5% throughout .",
    "this shows that the multigroup scheme consistently reduces to a grey model for frequency independent opacities .",
    "the kinetic model solves the equation of transfer directly using in this case 100 spatial zones , 64 directions and 64 frequency bins ( all the results from the kinetic model have been tested for resolution convergence ) .",
    "for a moment model , the total radiative temperature ( summed over all groups ; bright green ) and the gas temperature ( red ) are in excellent agreement with their kinetic counterparts , illustrating the validity of the @xmath0 model for radiative transfer and proving that the multigroup model consistently reverts to a grey model in the case of frequency - independent opacities .      as a second step , we consider a frequency variable opacity in order to assess its effect on the marshak wave test .",
    "the setup is identical to the grey test above , but the opacities in the groups 1 to 6 are ( in @xmath118 ) 1000 , 750 , 500 , 250 , 10 and 10 respectively .",
    "we also used 50 extra cells with steadily increasing widths at the right end of the grid in order to ensure that the radiation in the low - opacity groups does not have time to reach the right edge of the grid .",

    "the radiation in the groups with weak opacities ( notably groups 5 and 6 ) has crossed the entire grid and has heated the gas at the right edge ( the gas temperature at that point is now 330 k ) .",
    "the radiation in the groups 3 and 4 has also travelled further than in the previous test but not as far as groups 5 and 6 .",
    "we note that the radiative temperature of group 1 at the right edge is slightly higher than in the previous test ( just above 300 k as opposed to 275 k ) .",
    "since its opacity is unchanged , this shows that the gas has been heated by the radiation in the other groups and has re - radiated some of its energy into group 1 .",
    "the curves from the kinetic model ( using 400 cells , 100 directions and 512 frequencies ) are also plotted ( dashed lines ) .",
    "there is an extremely good agreement between the multigroup and kinetic gas temperatures .",
    "the total radiative temperatures differ somewhat more than in the previous test and this difference is due to larger discrepancies in the low opacity groups 5 and 6 .",
    "@xmath120 and @xmath121 are very close to their kinetic counterparts at the left edge of the grid but then drop rapidly and stabilize to a lower value .",
    "this is a boundary condition effect explained by the fact that when differences between the left and right fluxes are large ( which is the case at the domain boundaries since the flux in the ghost cells is set to zero ) the @xmath0 model becomes less accurate .",
    "a solution to this issue would be to consider an additional third moment equation or to solve two half equations ( one for the flux travelling towards the left and the other towards the right ) for the radiative flux @xcite .      in our third test",
    "we use frequency variable opacities which also vary with temperature .",
    "the setup is identical to the multigroup test above , but the opacities are set to @xmath122 where @xmath123 k and @xmath124 in the groups 1 to 6 are the same as in the previous test , namely ( in @xmath118 ) 1000 , 750 , 500 , 250 , 10 and 10 , respectively .",

    "our final test is to link sinerghy@xmath167d to the odalisc database of gas opacities in order to realistically model the evolution of a radiative shock in a xenon @xmath173 gas .",
    "the odalisc database aims to provide spectral opacities as well as mean opacities ( rosseland and planck ) of many elements for a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "the gas inside the box is initially at rest with a uniform density of @xmath174 , temperature @xmath175 ev in equilibrium with the radiation .",
    "the size of the box is 36 cm with 550 zones ; the first 100 cells have logarithmically increasing sizes , the first 500 zones cover the range @xmath176 cm and the last 50 have steadily increasing sizes , covering the range @xmath177 cm .",
    "we give the gas at the left boundary a velocity of 60 km  s@xmath164 , which generats a radiative shock travelling towards the right .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state with atomic mass number 131 .",
    "the opacities for the xe gas were taken from the odalisc database ( gomme average atom model ) .",
    "they depend on the gas temperature and density ( often more strongly on temperature ) as well as on the frequency .",
    "the opacity @xmath178 for the xe gas for a density @xmath107 and temperature @xmath179 ev is shown in fig .",

    "we used five groups to sample the opacities from @xmath180 to 770 ev ; the colour bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : knu ] illustrate the group decomposition of the frequency domain .",
    "frequencies below @xmath181 ev and above 770 ev are ignored , as gas temperatures in the box remain under 30 ev ( except the very narrow temperature spike ) .",
    "the gas at such temperatures does not radiate strongly at these frequencies .",

    "and @xmath184 ev as a function of frequencies .",
    "the colours illustrate the decomposition of the frequency domain into five groups from @xmath185 to 770 ev . ]    since the gas temperature and density evolve in time , the opacities need to be calculated at each timestep in each grid cell .",
    "the method we used to compute the opacities is to read in from the database a grid of opacities for the temperature range 0.01 to 100 ev and the density range @xmath181 to @xmath186 at the start of the run . from this",
    ", we then compute @xmath182 and @xmath183 in each group at each point @xmath187 which are stored into an array . during the simulation , a particular group opacity at any @xmath42 and @xmath18",
    "is then found using a simple four - point interpolation using the array data .",
    "the gas and radiative temperatures for our simulation of a multigroup radiative shock in a xe gas at a time @xmath188 s are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockxe ] ( top panel ) , along with the temperatures from an identical but grey run where only a single group over the same frequency range is used . a characteristic peak in the gas temperature ( bright red ) can be seen just around @xmath189 cm at the shock .",
    "there is a strong radiative precursor ( bright green ) which extends all the way to @xmath190 cm .",
    "the contributions to the precursor are clearly visible ; at first the energy from group 5 contributes the most but subsequently gets dominated by group 4 , 3 then 2 as we move further away from the shock .",
    "the radiation in the low - frequency group 1 does not appear to contribute to the dynamics of the shock .",
    "we note that the radiation in all the groups apart from group 2 gets absorbed fairly rapidly ( none get past @xmath191 cm ) , whereas since the opacities in group 2 are the lowest ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : knu ] ) , the radiation there propagates to a greater distance .",
    "differences in the positions of the tip of the radiative precursors in the other groups further illustrate the effect of variable gas opacities .",
    "( bright red ) , total radiative temperature @xmath115 ( summed over all groups , bright green ) and individual group radiative temperatures ( labelled 1 to 5 ) in the multigroup simulation of a radiative shock in xe gas at a time @xmath188 s. we have also included the gas temperature ( light blue ) and radiative temperature ( black ) from the grey run . : gas opacities for each group as a function of distance .",
    "the black curve represents the opacity in the grey run ( averaged over all frequencies ) . ]",
    "let us note major differences between the mutigroup and the grey models .",
    "due to the fact that opacities are averaged over the entire frequency range ( the low opacities are biased towards a higher value and vice versa ) , the radiation in the grey run suffers greater absorption far away from the shock and its radiative precursor ( black curve ) does not extend as far as in the multigroup case .",
    "however , between 0.3 and 0.7 cm , the grey radiative temperature is much higher than the multigroup one .",
    "for this reason , the gas is heated to a greater extent and the grey gas temperature ( light blue ) is higher than the multigroup one around @xmath192 cm .",
    "we also note that the multigroup gas temperature in the range @xmath193 cm is higher than for the grey run .",
    "the opacities of the gas in each group and the opacity for the grey run are plotted as a function of distance in fig .",
    "[ fig : shockxe ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this is an excellent illustration of how the opacities are affected by the gas temperature .",
    "for instance , we see that the opacity in the first group is of the order of @xmath194 in the cold gas ahead of the radiative precursor ( right hand side ) whereas it gains over three orders of magnitude in the hot post - shock gas . for groups 3 , 4 and 5 , the opposite occurs ; the opacity is high before the shock and low after .",
    "the opacities in the temperature transition region has diverse behaviours .",
    "most importantly , the curves are very different from the grey opacity ( black curve ) which is very constant with a single peak around 0.4 cm corresponding to the jump in gas temperature ( see light blue curve in the top panel ) .",
    "interestingly , the pre- and post - shock grey opacities are very similar .",
    "it becomes very clear that the grey model can not correctly represent the varied spectrum of opacities in such a situation , which are crucial to the evolution and dynamics of the shock .",
    "we have developed a multigroup model for rhd using the @xmath0 moment model .",
    "the equations of radiative transfer are solved in the comoving frame . in order to account for the opacity variations as a function of frequency , we introduced frequency groups and applied the @xmath0 closure inside each of them .",
    "this gave rise to new terms depending on the frequency when coupled to the hydrodynamics .",
    "we use a finite volume method in the frequency domain in order to evaluate these new coupling terms which account for energy exchange between neighbouring groups due to the doppler effect when strong velocity gradients are present in the gas flow .",
    "we have verified our method using a series of tests for both radiative transfer alone and radiative transfer coupled to hydrodynamics . in the case of the radiative transfer tests ,",
    "the method was found to be successful in reproducing the results obtained with a kinetic code , at a much lower computational cost .",
    "we have shown that the model reverts to a grey model for frequency independent opacities and that the model is capable of treating the effects of strong velocity gradients in a gas with frequency dependent opacities .",
    "finally , we have coupled the sinerghy@xmath167d code to the opacities from the odalisc database to realistically simulate the propagation of a radiative shock in a xe gas .",
    "we noted major differences between the multigroup and the grey models , showing the importance of accounting for the frequency variability of the gas opacities .",
    "the next step in this study will be to use a realistic equation of state for the xe gas using the odalisc database for more realistic simulations .",
    "odalisc also has a number of different methods to calculate the opacities for each element .",
    "we will study the influence of the uncertainties of the opacities on the results of simulations of radiative shock in xe in a following paper . in this work",
    "will also be included an investigation of the impact of the choice of frequency group boundaries and the number of groups on the results .",
    "we have now begun the implementation of this multigroup method for radiative transfer in the 3d radiation magnetohydrodynamics code heracles @xcite .",
    "the development of such a tool for hydrodynamical simulations will prove extremely important for future studies , in particular , in the field of astrophysics where high - energy radiation from bright stars or supernovae gets absorbed by dense clouds which re - radiate the energy in the infrared , or inside dense stellar atmospheres where many chemical elements are present .",
