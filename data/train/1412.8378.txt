    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is known to be incomplete , in that it needs to be augmented to include the effects of neutrino mass .",
    "furthermore , cosmology and astrophysics provide another strong motivation to extend the sm , through the need for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "evidence ranging in distance and time scales from the horizon during decoupling of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to sub - galactic distances points to the existence of ` missing mass ' in the form of cold , non - baryonic dm .",
    "the particle ( or , more generally , field theoretic ) identity of dark matter remains a mystery  one that has occupied the physics community for many years .    while the ` theory - space ' for dm remains enormous ,",
    "several model classes can be broadly identified .",
    "should new physics exist at or near the electroweak scale , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) becomes a viable option .",
    "the wimp paradigm assumes the existence of a relatively heavy particle ( typically with a mass in the gev to tev range ) having sizeable couplings to the sm .",
    "the self - annihilation into the sm regulates the wimp cosmic abundance according to thermal freeze - out , and the observed relic density requires a weak - scale annihilation rate .",
    "the simplest models of this type also predict a significant scattering rate for wimps in the galactic halo on nuclei , when up to @xmath5 of wimp kinetic energy can be transferred to atoms , offering a variety of pathways for detection .",
    "direct detection , as it has became known , is a rapidly growing field , with significant gains in sensitivity achieved in the last two decades , and with a clear path forward @xcite .    alternatively , dm could be in the form of super - weakly interacting particles , with a negligible abundance in the early universe , and generated through a sub - hubble thermal leakage rate ( also known as the ` freeze - in ' process ) .",
    "dark matter of this type is harder to detect directly , as the couplings to the sm are usually smaller than those of wimps by many orders of magnitude .",
    "metastability of such states offers a pathway for the indirect detection of photons in the decay products , as is the case for metastable neutrino - like particles in the @xmath6 mass range ( see , _",
    "@xcite ) . it was also pointed out in @xcite that wimp direct detection experiments are sensitive to bosonic dm particles with couplings of @xmath7 or below , that could be called super - wimps ( referring to the ` super - weak ' strength of their sm interactions ) .    finally , a completely different and independent class of models for dark matter involves light bosonic fields with an abundance generated via the vacuum misalignment mechanism @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "dm particles emerge from a cold condensate - like state with very large particle occupation numbers , which can be well described by a classical field configuration .",
    "the mass and initial amplitude of the dm field defines its present energy density .",
    "the most prominent example in this class , the qcd axion , does have a non - vanishing interaction with sm fields , although other forms of ` super - cold ' dm do not necessarily imply any significant coupling .",
    "while axion dark matter has been the focus of many experimental searches and proposals  @xcite , other forms of super - cold dark matter have received comparatively less attention ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in the course of these latter investigations , and subsequent work , several experimental strategies for detecting such dark matter scenarios",
    "have been suggested @xcite .    regarding the latter class of models , it is also possible to generate a dark matter abundance not only from a pre - existing condensate ( vacuum misalignment ) but gravitationally , during inflation , through perturbations in the field that carry finite wave number @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "recent work  @xcite investigates this possibility for vector particles , reaching the conclusion that such mechanism avoids large - scale isocurvature constraints from cmb observations , and allows light vectors to be generated in sufficient abundance as viable dark matter candidates .        in this paper",
    ", we consider ` dark photon dark matter ' generated through inflationary perturbations , or possibly other non - thermal mechanisms . while existing proposals to detect dark photons address the range of masses below @xmath9(mev ) , we will investigate the sensitivity of existing wimp - search experiments to dark photon dark matter with mass in the 10 ev - 100 kev window .",
    "as we will show , the coupling constant of the dark photon to electrons , @xmath10 , can be probed to exquisitely low values , down to mixing angles as low as @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , sensitivity to this mixing could be improved with careful analysis of the ` ionization - only ' signal available to a variety of dm experiments .",
    "the sensitivity of liquid xenon experiments to vector particles has already been explored in  @xcite and many experiments have already reported relevant analyses @xcite .",
    "while we concentrate on the stuckelberg - type mass for the vector field , our treatment of direct detection of @xmath0 will equally apply to the higgsed version of the model .",
    "moreover , the existence of a higgs field charged under @xmath12 opens up additional possibilities for achieving the required cosmological abundance of  @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dark - photon - dark ] we introduce the dark photon model in some more detail , describe existing constraints , and reconsider indirect limits . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm - absorpt - sign ] we compile the relevant formul  for direct detection , confront the model with existing direct detection results and derive constraints on the mixing angle @xmath13 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] , which shows the new direct detection limits in comparison to various astrophysical constraints . in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] , we provide a general discussion of super - weakly coupled dm , and possible improvements in sensitivity to ( sub-)kev - scale dm particles .",
    "it has been well - known since 1980s that the sm allows for a natural uv - complete extension by a new massive or massless @xmath12 field , coupled to the sm hypercharge @xmath14 via the kinetic mixing term @xcite . below the electroweak scale , the effective kinetic mixing of strength @xmath13 between the dark photon ( @xmath0 ) and photon ( @xmath15 ) with respective field strengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the most relevant , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the electromagnetic current and @xmath20 is the dark photon mass .",
    "this model has been under significant scrutiny over the last few years , as the minimal realization of one the few uv - complete extensions of the sm ( portals ) that allows for the existence of light weakly coupled particles @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider the stckelberg version of this vector portal , in which @xmath20 can be added by hand , rather than being induced via the higgs mechanism .",
    "light vector particles with @xmath21 have multiple contributions to their cosmological abundance , such as ( a ) production through scattering or annihilation , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , possibly with sub - hubble rates , ( b ) resonant photon - dark photon conversion , or ( c ) production from an initial dark photon condensate , as could be seeded by inflationary perturbations .",
    "notice that if mechanisms ( a ) and ( b ) are the only sources that populate the dm , they are not going to be compatible with cold dark matter when @xmath24 kev .    for mechanism ( a ) , naive dimensional analysis suggests a dark photon interaction rate @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the electron number density and @xmath27 is the centre - of - mass energy . at temperatures @xmath28 , where the number density of charge carriers is maximal , @xmath29 , this production rate scales linearly with temperature , whereas the hubble rate is a quadratic function of @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that for sub - mev mass dark vectors , the thermal production of @xmath0 is maximized at @xmath31 .",
    "however , simple parametric estimates of this kind may require refinement due to matter effects that alter the most naive picture . at finite temperature @xmath30",
    ", the in - medium effects can be cast into a modification of the mixing angle , @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the transverse ( t ) and longitudinal ( l ) polarization functions of the photon in the isotropic primordial plasma .",
    "they depend on photon energy @xmath34 and momentum @xmath35 and their temperature dependence is exposed by noting that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the plasma frequency ; for the cases of interest @xmath38 .    the consequences of these in - medium effects are two - fold .",
    "first , at high temperatures , they suppress the mixing angle since @xmath39 ( in the relativistic limit ) , thereby diminishing contributions to thermal production for @xmath40 .",
    "second , the presence of the medium allows the production to proceed resonantly , whenever @xmath41 [ process ( b ) above ] .",
    "indeed , resonant conversion dominates the thermal dark photon abundance for @xmath21 , but the constraints from direct detection experiments rule out the possibility of a thermal dark photon origin for @xmath42 altogether .",
    "the values of @xmath13 that are required for the correct thermal relic abundance , estimated in @xcite , are larger than the direct detection bounds discussed here by several orders of magnitude .",
    "dark photon dark matter remains a possibility when the relic density receives contributions from a vacuum condensate and/or from inflationary perturbations , process  ( c ) .",
    "the displacement of any bosonic field from the minimum of its potential can be taken as an initial condition , and during inflation any non - conformal scalar or vector field receives an initial contribution to such displacements scaling as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the hubble scale during inflation . even in absence of initial misalignment , the inflationary production of vector bosons can account for the observed dark matter density with a spectrum of density perturbations that is commensurate with those observed in the cmb  @xcite . while the production of transverse modes is suppressed , longitudinal modes can be produced in abundance  @xcite , @xmath45 for our mass range of interest the correct relic density would then be attained with @xmath44 in the @xmath46 ballpark .",
    "undoubtedly , interactions between dark photons and the plasma are present , and the evolution of any macroscopic occupation number of vector particles is complicated by ( resonant ) dissipation processes  @xcite . for small enough couplings , these processes may be made inefficient , and most of the vector particles are preserved to form the present day dm .",
    "equation ( [ eq : omg - inflation ] ) illustrates that  depending on the value @xmath44a successful cosmological model amenable to direct detection phenomenology can always be found , and in the remainder of this work we assume that @xmath47 , in accordance with the cmb - inferred cosmological cold dark matter density .",
    "consequently , we also assume that the galactic dark matter is saturated by @xmath0-particles , and neglect any effects from substructure .",
    "the latter is a possibility when inflationary perturbations produce excess power on very small scales  @xcite , and which will make the direct detection phenomenology ever more interesting . in this work ,",
    "we restrain ourselves to the smooth dark matter density and hence to the time - independent part of the absorption signal .      in vacuum , this theory is exceedingly simple , as it corresponds to one new vector particle of mass @xmath20 with a coupling @xmath10 to all charged particles .",
    "some of this simplicity disappears once the matter effects for the sm photon become important , and the effective mixing angle becomes suppressed .",
    "the subtleties of these calculations , taking proper account of the role of the longitudinal modes of @xmath0 , were fully accounted for only recently @xcite .",
    "an understanding of these effects is important because they determine the exclusion limits set by the energy loss processes in the sun , and other well - understood stars @xcite . in the limit of small @xmath20",
    "( small compared to the typical plasma frequency in the central region of the sun ) , the energy loss into vector particles scales as @xmath48 , and is dominated by the production of longitudinal modes @xcite .",
    "although the resulting constraints from energy loss processes turn out to be quite strong in the @xmath49 ev region , they weaken considerably for very small @xmath20 , opening a vast parameter space for a variety of laboratory detection methods .    for @xmath50",
    ", dark matter experiments are sensitive enough to compete with stellar energy loss bounds if dark photons contribute to a significant fraction of the dark matter cosmological abundance . here",
    "we review the most important aspects of stellar emission for the stckelberg case , whereby we also update our previously derived constraint on horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "ordinary photons inside a star can be assumed to be in good local thermal equilibrium so that their distribution function is time independent , @xmath51 .",
    "this allows one to relate photon production and absorption processes , @xmath52 . in analogy , for the production rate of on - shell dark photons one has , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the rate of emission for a vector particle with mass @xmath20 and longitudinal ( @xmath55 ) or transverse ( @xmath30 ) polarization , while @xmath56 is defined in ( [ eq : kappa - eff ] ) . inside active stars like our sun , the rate is dominated by bremsstrahlung processes ; for explicit formulae see  @xcite and @xcite . the expression ( [ eq : detailedbalance ] )",
    "is useful since the optical theorem ( at finite temperature ) relates @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "importantly , as alluded to above , emission can proceed resonantly when @xmath58 ; see  ( [ eq : kappa - eff ] ) . in the emission of an on - shell dark photon , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , up to corrections of @xmath61 .",
    "a resonance inside a star occurs when either @xmath62 ( longitudinal ) or @xmath63 ( transverse ) .",
    "the emission then proceeds from a spherical shell of radius @xmath64 and the rates become independent of the details of the emission process .",
    "one may then integrate over the stellar profile by using the narrow width approximation  @xcite , @xmath65 for each polarization of transverse @xmath0-bosons .",
    "this form nicely exhibits the different decoupling behavior with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "the bounds derived from stellar energy loss may qualitatively be understood on noting that the typical plasma frequency at the center of the star is given by , @xmath66 and both longitudinal and transverse resonant emission stops once @xmath67 . in our numerical analysis , we employ the full expressions for emission that also cover the case in which dark photons are emitted off - resonance .",
    "the shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] are a summary of the astrophysical constraints on the mixing parameter @xmath68 that are independent of the relic density of dark photon dark matter .",
    "the thin solid ( dotted ) gray lines show the constraints that are based solely on the emission of transverse ( longitudinal ) modes .    for the sun , the limit on the anomalous energy loss rate is identical to the one in previous work  @xcite . as a criterion",
    "we require that the luminosity in dark photons can not exceed 10% of the solar luminosity , @xmath69  w. the limit is derived from observations of the @xmath70b neutrino flux ; for details we refer the reader to the above references .    for horizontal branch ( hb )",
    "stars , we update our own previously derived limit as follows ( a similar limit has already been presented in  @xcite ) : as an hb representative , we consider a @xmath71 solar mass star with stellar profiles as shown in in  @xcite . the energy loss",
    "is then limited to 10% of the hb s",
    "luminosity  @xcite , for which we take @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "the transverse modes dominate the energy loss in hb stars .",
    "since the corresponding resonant emission originates from one shell @xmath73 for all energies , the derived constraint is sensitive to the stellar density profile in the resonance region @xmath74 .",
    "for example , the kink visible in the thin gray line at @xmath75 originates from entering the he - burning shell .",
    "our result is in qualitative agreement with  @xcite ; quantitative differences may be assigned to our use of full emission rate expressions [ rather then ( [ eq : resonant - rates ] ) ] that are integrated using monte carlo methods over the assumed stellar profile . in either case ,",
    "such bounds are  by construction  only representative in nature and a detailed comparison of the derived limits will not yield much further insight .    finally , the constraint that can be derived from red giant ( rg ) stars extends sensitivity to larger @xmath20 .",
    "we require a dark photon luminosity that is less then @xmath76 originating from the degenerate he core with @xmath77 , @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "longitudinal emission dominates until transverse emission becomes resonant at @xmath79 .",
    "here we note that there is room for improvement when deriving the limit from rg stars .",
    "for example , recent high - precision photometry for the galactic globular cluster m5 has allowed the authors of  @xcite to derive constraints on axion - electric couplings and neutrino dipole moments that are based on the observed brightness of the tip of the rg branch .",
    "in conjunction with an actual stellar model , however , the better observations do not yield a drastic improvement of limits , as there appears to be a slight preference for extra cooling  @xcite .",
    "albeit such hints to new physics are tantalizing , we in turn expect only mild changes to our representative rg constraint when a detailed stellar model is employed and/or better observational data is used ; we leave such study for the future .",
    "next we consider constraints imposed by energy injection from @xmath4-rays originating from @xmath3 decays below the @xmath80 threshold , for which the one - photon inclusive differential rate was computed in  @xcite .",

    "fortunately , this difference has little effect on the absorption rate for the following reason . both the photon wavelength and the dm compton wavelength are much larger than the linear dimension of the atom , allowing for a multipole expansion in the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the ( dark ) photon polarization .",

    "with an array of direct detection experiments now searching for signatures of elastic nuclear recoil of wimps on nuclei , and with sensitivity levels marching towards the neutrino background , it is important to keep in mind that other dark matter scenarios can also be sensitively probed with this technology . in particular ,",
    "the exquisite sensitivity to ionization signatures at various experiments allows stringent constraints to be placed on generic models of super - weakly - interacting dark matter . in this paper , we have studied the sensitivity to the minimal model of dark photon dark matter , and obtained limits ( summarized in fig .  [",
    "fig : summary ] ) that exceed those from stellar physics over a significant mass range .",
    "the sensitivity of current direct detection experiments already excludes dark photon dark matter with a thermally generated abundance .",
    "this is not a problem for the model , as the dm abundance may be determined by non - thermal mechanisms .",
    "for example , perturbations during inflation may create the required relic abundance  @xcite , and further constraints on such models may be achieved if an upper bound on @xmath44 were to be established by experiments probing the cmb .",
    "dark photon dark matter has certain advantages over axion - like - particle dark matter with respect to direct detection .",
    "the absence of the dark photon decay to two photons removes the constraint from monochromatic x - ray lines .",
    "this latter signature usually provides a more stringent constraint on axion - like kev - scale dm than direct detection .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for dark photons is significantly enhanced for small masses , relative to the cross section for absorption of axion - like particles .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper addresses the model of a very light dark photon field , that is particularly simple and well - motivated .",
    "in addition , one could construct a whole family of ` simplified ' models of very light dark matter , with observational consequences for direct detection @xcite .",
    "the most relevant of these would involve couplings to electrons , and one could consider dm of different spin and parity : @xmath182 here @xmath100 stands for the electron field , @xmath183 parametrizes the dimensionless couplings , and @xmath184 are the fields of metastable but very long lived dm .",
    "the case considered in this paper corresponds to @xmath185 , and the light mass @xmath20 is protected by gauge invariance . however , even cases where the mass of dm is not protected by any symmetry are of interest , and can be considered within effective ( or simplified ) models . in this case ,",
    "loop processes tend to induce a finite mass correction , which is at most @xmath186 . with the cutoff @xmath187 at a tev ,",
    "it is natural to expect that , for a dm mass of @xmath188 100  ev for example , one should have @xmath189 . as demonstrated by the analysis in this paper",
    ", dm experiments can probe well into this naturalness - inspired regime , and set meaningful constraints on many variations of light dm models .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that further progress can be achieved through the analysis of ` ionization - only ' signatures .",
    "for example , in noble gas- and liquid - based detectors one can improve the bounds for @xmath190 by accounting for multiple ionization electrons ( see ref .",
    "the ionization of xe atoms from the lowest electronic shells is likely accompanied by auger processes , which generate further photo - electrons , and the corresponding bounds can be tightened .",
    "analysis of these complicated processes may require additional input from atomic physics .",
