    "the classical notion of kolmogorov complexity @xcite is an objective measure for the information in a _ single _ object , and information distance measures the information between a _",
    "pair _ of objects @xcite .",
    "this last notion has spawned research in the theoretical direction , among others @xcite .",
    "research in the practical direction has focused on the normalized information distance ( nid ) , also called the similarity metric , which arises by normalizing the information distance in a proper manner .",
    "if we also approximate the kolmogorov complexity through real - world compressors @xcite , then we obtain the normalized compression distance ( ncd ) .",
    "this is a parameter - free , feature - free , and alignment - free similarity measure that has had great impact in applications .",
    "the ncd was preceded by a related nonoptimal distance @xcite . in @xcite",
    "another variant of the ncd has been tested on all major time - sequence databases used in all major data - mining conferences against all other major methods used .",
    "the compression method turned out to be competitive in general and superior in heterogeneous data clustering and anomaly detection .",
    "there have been many applications in pattern recognition , phylogeny , clustering , and classification , ranging from hurricane forecasting and music to to genomics and analysis of network traffic , see the many papers referencing @xcite in google scholar .",
    "the ncd is trivially computable . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that its theoretical precursor , the nid , is a metric up to negligible discrepancies in the metric ( in)equalities and that it is always between 0 and 1 .",
    "the computability status of the nid has been open , see remark vi.1 in @xcite which asks whether the nid is upper semicomputable , and ( open ) exercise 8.4.4 ( c ) in the textbook @xcite which asks whether the nid is semicomputable at all .",
    "we resolve this question by showing the following .",
    "let @xmath0 be binary strings of length @xmath1 and denote the nid between them by @xmath2 .",
    "\\(i ) there is no upper semicomputable function @xmath3 such that @xmath4 ( lemma  [ lem.upper ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) there is no lower semicomputable function @xmath3 such that @xmath5 ( lemma  [ lem.lower ] ) .",
    "we write _ string _ to mean a finite binary string , and @xmath6 denotes the empty string .",
    "the _ length _ of a string @xmath7 ( the number of bits in it ) is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 . moreover , we identify strings with natural numbers by associating each string with its index in the length - increasing lexicographic ordering @xmath10 informally , the kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of the shortest string from which the original string can be losslessly reconstructed by an effective general - purpose computer such as a particular universal turing machine @xmath11 , @xcite .",
    "hence it constitutes a lower bound on how far a lossless compression program can compress . in this paper",
    "we require that the set of programs of @xmath11 is prefix free ( no program is a proper prefix of another program ) , that is , we deal with the _ prefix kolmogorov complexity_. ( but for the results in this paper it does not matter whether we use the plain kolmogorov complexity or the prefix kolmogorov complexity . )",
    "we call @xmath11 the _ reference universal turing machine_. formally , the _ conditional prefix kolmogorov complexity _ @xmath12 is the length of the shortest input @xmath13 such that the reference universal turing machine @xmath11 on input @xmath13 with auxiliary information @xmath14 outputs @xmath7 .",

    "let @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the nonnegative integers and the real numbers , respectively .",
    "a function @xmath19 is _ upper semicomputable _ ( or @xmath20 ) if it is defined by a rational - valued computable function @xmath21 where @xmath7 is a string and @xmath22 is a nonnegative integer such that @xmath23 for every @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "this means that @xmath25 can be computably approximated from above .",
