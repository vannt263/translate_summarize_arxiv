    "camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 are endpoint compounds in the series ca@xmath5la@xmath6mno@xmath0 , which has been thoroughly studied experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "they have relatively simple atomic and magnetic structures , their magnetic excitations are well described by a spin wave hamiltonian @xcite and exchange constants , j , are well established by neutron scattering @xcite and from the nel temperature @xcite .",
    "exchange coupling in manganites has been extensively studied using model hamiltonian @xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite .",
    "this paper presents results of bulk _ ab initio _ unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) and cluster configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations of exchange constants for both compounds .",
    "exchange constants obtained from ci calculations are in excellent agreement with experiment and the localised orbital ci wavefunctions are analysed to determine which quantum fluctuations are most important in exchange coupling .",
    "model hamiltonian calculations have attributed the exchange coupling energy to o@xmath7 to mn@xmath8 superexchange @xcite , mn  d@xmath9  d@xmath9/mn  d@xmath10  d@xmath11 t@xmath12 superexchange @xcite , or both @xcite . results of calculations presented below show that both exchange mechanisms operate and that o superexchange is the more important of the two .",
    "this was also found to be the case in the model hamiltonian calculations of meskine _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "ci cluster calculations provide detailed information on exchange couplings between neighbouring mn ions , however a bulk electronic structure technique is required to study orbital ordering in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "total energies of lamno@xmath0 with a and g - type anti - ferromagnetic ( a - af and g - af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin orderings have been computed in several isovolume structures in order to establish whether or not orbital ordering and spin ordering terms in the hamiltonian for lamno@xmath0 are independent .",
    "obviously exchange constants will depend on orbital ordering , as the latter determines which empty orbitals are available to participate in exchange coupling .",
    "however , it is not known whether the e@xmath4 electron density in lamno@xmath0 for a particular orbital ordering depends on spin ordering . it is shown below that a common orbital ordering energy for any of several orbital orderings can be identified and that this energy is independent of spin ordering , to a high degree .",
    "spin and orbital ordering terms in the hamiltonian are therefore independent , although orbital ordering determines the exchange constants .    at low temperatures , camno@xmath0 exists in a cubic perovskite structure ( lattice constant 3.73   ) with g - af magnetic ordering @xcite and a nel temperature of 130  k. using the rushbrooke - wood formula @xcite , this nel temperature implies an exchange constant j = 6.6  mev .",
    "note that throughout this work the spin hamiltonian is of the form due to domb and sykes @xcite    @xmath13    @xmath14 is a spin operator , s is the magnitude of the total spin for an ion and j@xmath15 is the exchange constant for a pair of ions .",
    "this form is adopted for the hamiltonian as it is the same as that adopted in modelling spin wave dispersion in neutron scattering studies @xcite , except for a small dzyaloshinsky - moriya term .    at low temperatures the space group of lamno@xmath0 is _",
    "pnma _ @xcite .",
    "the ground state magnetic structure is a - af and the unit cell contains four formula units consisting of rotated and distorted octahedra .",
    "there is one more d electron per mn ion ( @xmath16 camno@xmath0 ) , which occupies an e@xmath4 orbital and induces a jahn - teller distortion in each mno@xmath17 octahedron , resulting in three distinct mn - o bond lengths of 1.91 , 1.97 and 2.18  @xcite .",
    "the occupied e@xmath4 orbital is a linear combination of d@xmath18 and d@xmath19 orbitals .",
    "the largest orbital component lies along the most elongated mn - o bond .",

    "structure is shown in fig .",

    "the results of a number of neutron and x - ray scattering studies of the structure of lamno@xmath0 @xcite over a range of temperatures are summarised in ref.@xcite .",
    "pnma _ structure can be viewed as containing planes of mn@xmath11 ions , each joined to its in - plane neighbours by pairs of short ( 1.91   ) and long ( 2.18   ) mn - o bonds . each mn@xmath11 ion in a particular plane is coupled to mn@xmath11 ions in planes immediately above and below by two mn - o bonds ( 1.97   ) .",
    "the symmetry of the _ pnma _ structure is such that there is one in - plane ( nearest neighbour ) exchange constant ( j@xmath23 ) and one out - of - plane constant ( j@xmath24 ) . both j@xmath23 and j@xmath24",
    "have been determined from two independent neutron scattering studies to be -6.7 and 4.8 mev , respectively , @xcite .",
    "thus there is fm coupling within planes and af coupling between planes .",
    "the first comprehensive attempt to explain atomic and magnetic structures in doped and undoped manganites was made by goodenough @xcite in 1955 .",
    "he assumed three classes of exchange interaction between neighbouring mn ions in undoped camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 lattices .",
    "a specific ordering of @xmath25e@xmath4 orbitals and relative orientations of pairs of empty e@xmath4 orbitals correponding to goodenough s classification are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . when empty e@xmath4 orbitals are available on a pair of neighbouring mn ions and are oriented towards one another ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b ) then af coupling of the mn ion spins is energetically favoured .",
    "this is because electrons from the central o@xmath7 ion of either spin are postulated to delocalise onto both mn ions simultaneously , owing to the favourable exchange interaction ( hund s rule ) between the delocalised electron and the mn ion spin .",
    "however , if the mn ion spins are fm aligned , only the electron from the central o@xmath7 ion with the same spin orientation as the mn ions can delocalise onto either mn ion , resulting in a higher energy for that state . thus the empty orbital arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]b results in an af coupling of mn spins .",
    "this is a type i exchange interaction according to goodenough @xcite .",
    "when one empty e@xmath4 orbital is suitably oriented for o@xmath7 ion electron delocalisation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]c ) , fm coupling of the mn ion spins is favoured .",
    "this is a type ii interaction . finally , when no empty hybrids are available ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]d ) , no delocalisation occurs .",
    "this is a type iii interaction .",
    "this model has been used to explain the relative energies of a - af , g - af and fm magnetic states of camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 with a cubic perovskite structure @xcite . in that work",
    "it was found that the relative energies of these magnetic structures could be explained by counting the numbers of each type of interaction in each magnetic state and calculating the relative energy of each type of interaction .",
    "for both camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 it was found that the type i af interaction was more energetically favourable than the type ii interaction by 10  mev @xcite .",
    "the simplified description of exchange interactions just given assumes that an empty e@xmath4 orbital is either available or not",
    ". however , empty e@xmath4 orbitals in lamno@xmath0 are not purely d@xmath18 or d@xmath19 in character @xcite .",
    "the mixed character of the empty e@xmath4 orbital permits some exchange coupling even when the empty e@xmath4 orbital is not optimally oriented .",
    "this type of reasoning was used by millis @xcite in a calculation of exchange coupling energies in camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 . in that work configurations allowed by the pauli principle in which one or two electrons hop from the central o@xmath7 ion to one or",
    "both neighbouring mn ions are considered .",
    "configurations which differ by a single electron hop have a single hopping matrix element , t. diagonal elements of the hamiltonian are parametrised using the energy required to excite one electron or a pair of electrons from an o@xmath7 ion to a mn ion . in camno@xmath0",
    "the configuration which is assumed to lead to stabilisation of the af state over the fm state is one in which a pair of electrons on the o@xmath7 ion is excited onto separate mn@xmath9 ions .",
    "if this were indeed the origin of exchange coupling in camno@xmath0 then one would expect this configuration to appear in an _ ab initio _ ground state ci wave function , but this is not the case .",
    "however , the main idea of this model , that more low energy configurations are available to singlet states than high spin multiplicity states , is in accord with results presented here .",
    "ci cluster calculations of exchange constants in la@xmath26cuo@xmath27 @xcite and knif@xmath28 @xcite , which used delocalised molecular orbitals have been reported quite recently .",
    "ci cluster calculations described below were carried out in a localised orbital basis .",
    "the localised orbital basis provides a means of identifying the exchange coupling mechanism in terms of fluctuations of electrons between localised orbitals .",
    "these calculations were performed on mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and mn@xmath1o@xmath3 clusters representing fragments of camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 .",
    "details of the calculations , including the method used to generate the localised orbitals , details of a spherical array of point charges surrounding the clusters , _ etc .",
    "_ are given in appendix  [ app : details ] .",
    "the wavefunctions for the clusters contain orbitals which are partitioned into a ( doubly - occupied ) core orbital space , an active space containing the 2p orbitals of the o@xmath7 ion situated between the two mn ions in the cluster as well as singly - occupied mn d orbitals and an external space containing unoccupied mn d orbitals .",
    "the core orbital space contains core electrons as well as valence electrons not in the active orbital space .",
    "the ions in the clusters treated quantum mechanically consisted of two corner sharing mno@xmath29 octahedra .",
    "the localised orbitals in the active space for the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and mn@xmath1o@xmath3 clusters are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "the main electronic configuration for the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster representing camno@xmath0 is one in which each mn ion with a formal 4 + charge contains three t@xmath12 electrons and each oxygen ion exists in a closed shell o@xmath7 configuration .",
    "the actual charge on the mn ions is significantly reduced as there is a covalent component to the mn - o bonds , as can clearly be seen in the contour plot of the localised orbital with mainly o 2pz character in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the actual mn ion charge in camno@xmath0 is + 2.13 , according to a mulliken population analysis of the uhf wave functions obtained for camno@xmath0 .",
    "the formal charge on mn ions in lamno@xmath0 is 3 + , however a mulliken population analysis of uhf wave functions for lamno@xmath0 yields a charge of + 2.24 the o ion charges in the two compounds are -1.33 ( camno@xmath0 ) and -1.75 and -1.82 ( lamno@xmath0 ) .",
    "exchange constants were calculated by finding the energy difference between the spin singlet and spin septet(nonet ) states of the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and mn@xmath1o@xmath3 clusters .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] and doubly occupied core orbitals . a septet state for the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster was constructed from six singly - occupied t@xmath12 orbitals and doubly occupied o 2p orbitals localised on the central o ion in the cluster .",
    "the form of this wave function is    @xmath30    @xmath31 is the anti - symmetrising operator and the subscripts _",
    "r _ on t@xmath12 orbitals in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn2 ] indicate that they are centred on the left or right mn ion , respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is a product of doubly occupied orbitals in the core orbital space which includes the 2p orbitals on the central o@xmath7 .",
    "this is the restricted open shell hartree - fock ( rohf ) wave function for the septet state , constructed using localised molecular orbitals .",
    "self - consistent field ( scf ) rohf wave functions can be computed using a number of standard electronic structure packages such as the gamess package @xcite used in this work .",
    "the singlet state is constructed from the same set of singly - occupied orbitals with a spin - coupling of the form    @xmath33    this is one of five spin eigenfunctions @xcite ( sef ) for six electrons coupled into a singlet state .",
    "provided that the spatial orbitals multiplying this sef are ordered such that orbitals localised on each mn ion are grouped together , we expect this sef to dominate the ci wave function , since hund s rule requires spins on each ion to be coupled with the same spin .",
    "this is indeed found to be the case in the actual ci wave function for the singlet state of the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster representing camno@xmath0 .",
    "the wave function for the singlet state is therefore    @xmath34    using conventional rules for evaluating determinantal energies @xcite , the energy difference between the two states is k@xmath35 + k@xmath36 , with the singlet state lying _ above _ the septet state ( assuming that other inter - site exchange integrals are zero because of negligible spatial overlap ) . when the ground state energies of the singlet and septet states of the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster with wave functions in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn2 ] and [ eqn : eqn4 ] were evaluated , the singlet state was 3.6  mev above the septet state .",
    "this implies a value of 1.8  mev for the exchange integrals just mentioned .",
    "note that we use the notation k@xmath15 for exchange integrals between specific molecular orbitals while we use the notation j for the ( effective ) exchange coupling energy of two spins on different mn ions .",
    "the singlet and septet states of this configuration are analogous to the heitler - london valence bond wave function for the singlet and triplet states of the he atom in a 1s2s configuration . in that case",
    "the triplet state is lower than the singlet state by k@xmath37 .    in general , ci wave functions with n electrons in the active orbital space consist of linear combinations of spin - adapted functions ( saf s )    @xmath38    @xmath39    where a saf is a product of spatial orbitals and a sef , @xmath40 , for the particular spin state in question .",
    "the septet and singlet saf s in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn2 ] and [ eqn : eqn4 ] are the dominant terms in a more general ci expansion of the septet and singlet wave function of the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster .",
    "all saf s which are obtainable by exciting one or two electrons from the dominant saf s to empty orbitals in the active space are included in the expansion . as stated above , the 13 orbitals in the active space in the calculations described here are comprised of 10 orbitals of mainly mn 3d character and 3 of mainly o 2p character localised on the o ion between the two mn ions .",
    "these excited electron saf s enter the wave function with a maximum weight of order 10@xmath41 and a corresponding occupancy of order 10@xmath42 and it is these which lower the energy of the singlet state below the septet state when the spins are af coupled .",
    "the main excited saf s in the singlet and septet wave functions are those in which : @xmath43 electron is excited from an o 2p orbital to the mn e@xmath4 orbital aligned with the mn - o axis ( o to e@xmath4 ( 1e ) ) ; a @xmath44 of electrons are excited from one o 2p orbital to the @xmath45 mn e@xmath4 orbital ( o to e@xmath4 ( 2e ) ) and an excitation in which a t@xmath12 electron is transferred fron one mn ion to the other ( t@xmath12 exchange ) . obviously the latter exchange process is only allowed in the singlet state as it violates the pauli exclusion principle in the septet state when the t@xmath12 shells are half filled , as in camno@xmath0 .",
    "excitations in which a pair of electrons are excited from the o ion to separate mn ions are found to have negligible weight for both spin states .",
    "uhf total energy calculations were performed using the crystal98 code @xcite for fm , a- , c- , and g - af spin orderings .",
    "the energy of the cubic fm structure with the experimental lattice constant of 3.73    was adopted as the reference energy ( 0 mev ) ; calculations were also performed for each of the spin orderings with a lattice constant of 3.75   .",
    "total energies and magnetic moments from these calculations are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "when these total energy differences are fitted to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn1 ] with nearest ( j@xmath46 ) and second nearest ( j@xmath26 ) neighbour interactions ( _ i.e. _ along [ a,0,0 ] and [ a , a,0 ] , where a is the lattice constant ) , the parameters obtained for a lattice constant of 3.73    are j@xmath46 = 10.7 mev , j@xmath26 = 0.3 mev and for a lattice constant of 3.75   , the parameters are j@xmath46 = 10.1 mev , j@xmath26 = 0.3 mev .",
    "it is generally believed that exchange interactions which connect magnetic ions along a linear chain are stronger than those which do not , such as the j@xmath26 interaction here . however , in the cubic perovskite structure , exchange interactions along [ 2a,0,0 ] , _ etc . _",
    "contribute equally to all four spin orderings studied and so can not be extracted from the data presented here .",
    "similar values for j@xmath46 have been obtained from model hamiltonian calculations by meskine _",
    "( j@xmath46 =  9.5 mev ) @xcite .",
    "note that the definition used for the exchange energy in that work , the difference between the energy of a pair of ferro- and anti - ferromagnetically coupled mn ions , is @xmath47 the exchange energy defined in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn1 ] above .",
    "hence values for exchange energies from that work have been divided by two in order to compare them to values in the present work .",
    "exchange energies obtained from cluster ci calculations depend strongly on mn e@xmath4 and o 2p orbital populations .",
    "in turn these populations depend on the madelung potential of a sphere of point charges surrounding the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster .",
    "the charges were located on crystal ion sites and mulliken populations of ions in bulk uhf calculations on camno@xmath0 were used as a guide in choosing the magnitudes of these charges .",
    "the sphere of point charges had a radius of just over 20    and contained around 3300 charges .",
    "the radius was chosen so that the sphere was overall almost charge neutral ; each unit cell of point charges was also neutral .",
    "the dependence of exchange energies in camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 on mn ion charge , measured by the mulliken population of that ion in the scf cluster calculation , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the charge on the two mn ions @xmath48 was adjusted by transferring charge from mn point charge sites to ca or la point charge sites @xmath49 .",
    "the total charge of the mn and ca ( or la ) point charges was kept constant and the o ion charge was maintained at the uhf mulliken population value .",
    "it can be seen that the magnitude of the exchange energy increases as charge is removed from the mn ion , which is reasonable as charge is mainly being transferred to / from the e@xmath4 orbitals which are directly involved in the exchange coupling mechanism - as the e@xmath4 orbital becomes filled , the exchange energy diminishes .",
    "the ci calculation value of j@xmath46 =  8.1 mev quoted for camno@xmath0 in table [ tab : tab2 ] is the value obtained for an mn cluster ion charge of + 2.13 , the mn ion charge determined from the uhf calculation .",
    "this is to be compared to an estimate of the experimental value of j@xmath46 =  6.6 mev , derived from the nel temperature of camno@xmath0 .",
    "the fundamental saf s for the septet and singlet states of the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster were given in eq .",
    "[ eqn : eqn2 ] and [ eqn : eqn4 ] . in the fundamental saf wave functions for either spin state ,",
    "each has a saf coefficient , c@xmath50 , of unity , however when additional saf s are permitted in the wave function ( _ i.e. _ permitting o@xmath7 ion 2p to e@xmath4 excitations , _ etc .",
    "_ ) the weights of fundamental saf s are around 0.9950 and additional saf s corresponding to o superexchange and t@xmath12 exchange enter the wave function with saf coefficients of order 0.01 . even for limited active spaces",
    "( as in these calculations ) the number of saf s entering the wavefunction means that a convenient way to analyse the wavefunction is to tabulate the summed occupancies ( _ i.e. _ @xmath51 ) of configurations of a particular type .",
    "there are , for example , several saf s in which one electron is excited from an o 2p orbital to an mn e@xmath4 orbital @xcite .",
    "the relative magnitudes of these occupancies are a measure of the importance of each type of fluctuation about the fundamental saf configurations . summed occupation numbers for the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 cluster",
    "are given in table [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the fundamental ( or main ) saf has occupancy 0.9926 for the singlet state while it has occupancy 0.9943 in the septet state and therefore that there are larger correlation effects in the singlet state .",
    "saf s in which a t@xmath12 electron has hopped from one mn ion to the other have an occupancy of 0.0005 , while these fluctuations are absent from the septet state owing to the pauli exclusion principle , as noted above . however , the main difference in septet and singlet wave functions is in the occupancy of states in which one electron is transferred from an o 2p orbital to an e@xmath4 orbital , the occupancy being 0.0038 for the singlet state and 0.0027 for the septet state .",
    "the occupancy of saf s in which a pair of electrons is transferred from o 2p to one mn e@xmath4 orbital is the same for both spin states .",
    "the energies of both spin states relative to the energy of the fundamental septet saf are also given in table [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "the septet state with o superexchange fluctuations is 133.4 mev below the fundamental septet saf .",
    "this is the correlation energy for that state @xcite .",
    "the singlet state with o superexchange and t@xmath12 fluctuations is 149.6 mev below the reference energy and 153.2 mev below the fundamental singlet saf energy .",
    "the latter energy is the correlation energy for the singlet state .",
    "correlation energies for the mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and mn@xmath1o@xmath3 cluster ci wave functions are illustrated schematically in figure [ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "correlation energies are around 50 percent larger in mn@xmath1o@xmath2 than in mn@xmath1o@xmath3 and this is reflected in the larger exchange energy in camno@xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that when the ci cluster calculation for the exchange energy in camno@xmath0 was performed with no point charge array surrounding the cluster , the exchange energy obtained was 57 mev , well in excess of the experimental value .",
    "this emphasises the importance of madelung terms in the crystal hamiltonian in determining exchange energies in strongly correlated materials .",
    "total energy calculations were performed on lamno@xmath0 in the ideal perovskite ( cubic ) structure , a tetragonal perovskite structure , a cubic structure with a jahn - teller distortion of the mno@xmath17 octahedra and the _ pnma _ structure with atomic coordinates derived from experiment @xcite and by minimising the total energy by varying lattice parameters and internal coordinates not determined by symmetry .",
    "these structures are summarised in table [ tab : tab4 ] .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion consisted of elongation or contraction of mn - o bonds parallel to the @xmath52 axes of the unit cell .",
    "these are the mn - o bonds which induce fm coupling between mn ions in the _ pnma _ structure .",
    "the cubic structure with the lowest energy had a lattice constant of 3.953   ( volume 61.77  @xmath53 per mn ion ) which is comparable to the lattice constant of the cubic phase of lamno@xmath0 ( 3.947   ) which occurs at temperatures above 750k @xcite .",
    "all relative energies and lattice volumes will be assumed to be per mn ion hereafter .",
    "when this structure is changed by a 5 percent jahn - teller distortion ( table [ tab : tab4 ] ) the energy is lowered by 304 mev and the magnetic ground state of the structure switches from d@xmath18 d@xmath19 fm to d@xmath54 d@xmath55 fm ( see below ) .",
    "the total energy of the _ pnma _ structure using coordinates from experiment @xcite ( table [ tab : tab4 ] ) is 200  mev above the jahn - teller distorted structure .",
    "the total energy of the _ pnma _ structure was minimised @xcite by varying the lattice parameters and 7 internal coordinates not determined by symmetry of the _ pnma _ space group .",
    "the total energy of the energy minimised structure is 6 mev above the jahn - teller distorted structure .",
    "the optimised lattice parameters and internal coordinates are given in table  [ tab : tab4 ] ; the @xmath20 lattice vector is essentially unchanged while the @xmath21 and @xmath22 lattice vectors increase in magnitude by 1.1 and 1.6 percent , respectively .",
    "the lattice volume rises from 60.89 to 62.53  @xmath53 .",
    "probably the most important changes which occur on minimising the total energy are : the degree of jahn - teller distortion is reduced ; la - o distances increase significantly . in the lowest energy cubic structure",
    "there is one mn - o distance of 1.976    and an la - o distance of 2.795   .",
    "on introducing the 5 percent jahn - teller distortion these become mn - o distances of 1.877 , 1.976 and 2.075    and la - o distances of 2.795 and 2.797   . in the experimental _ pnma",

    "these change to 1.910 , 1.944 and 2.135    and 2.609 , 2.666 and 2.684    in the energy minimised structure .",
    "hence lower energies are found for structures with larger la - o distances and a reduced jahn - teller distortion .",
    "the combined ionic radii of la@xmath11 and o@xmath7 are 2.76 @xcite .",
    "la - o distances in the energy minimised _ pnma _ and cubic structures lie just below the combined ionic radii distance , whereas the la - o distances in the experimental _ pnma _ structure lie well below this distance .",

    "they report an energy lowering of 1055 mev when the cubic structure is changed to the experimental _ pnma _ structure with no volume change .",
    "this calculation will overestimate the energy difference between such structures as the cubic structure with the _ pnma _ structure equilibrium volume is not the mimimum energy cubic structure .",
    "for the cubic perovskite structure it was found that variations of the total energies of different spin and orbital orderings can be fitted very well by a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is an orbital ordering term which depends only on the orbital order .",
    "for these calculations the cubic unit cell was doubled along [ 110 ] , [ 101 ] and [ 011 ] directions ( g - af spin and orbital ordering ) and along the [ 001 ] direction ( a - af spin and orbital ordering ) and total energies and charge density difference plots @xcite were computed for d@xmath18 d@xmath18 , d@xmath18 d@xmath19 and d@xmath19 d@xmath19 orbital orderings and fm , a - af and g - af spin orderings . the d@xmath18 d@xmath19 a - af combination is incompatible with the unit cell doublings chosen and was omitted .",

    "<S> the equilibrium structure and exchange constants of camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 have been investigated using total energy unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) and localised orbital configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations on the bulk compounds and mn@xmath1o@xmath2 and mn@xmath1o@xmath3 clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted structure and exchange constants for camno@xmath0 are in reasonable agreement with estimates based on its nel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a series of calculations on lamno@xmath0 in the cubic perovskite structure shows that a hamiltonian with independent orbital ordering and exchange terms accounts for the total energies of cubic lamno@xmath0 with various spin and orbital orderings . </S>",
    "<S> computed exchange constants depend on orbital ordering . </S>",
    "<S> exchange contributions to the total energy vary between -20 and 20 mev per mn ion , differences in orbital ordering energy vary between 3 and 100 mev and a jahn - teller distortion results in an energy reduction of around 300 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant of the lowest energy cubic perovskite structure ( 3.953  ) is in good agreement with the lattice constant of the high temperature cubic phase of lamno@xmath0 ( 3.947  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of _ pnma _ lamno@xmath0 was minimised by varying lattice parameters and seven internal coordinates and a structure 194 mev per mn ion below that of a structure determined by neutron diffraction was found . </S>",
    "<S> this optimised structure is nearly isoenergetic with a cubic perovskite structure with a 5 percent jahn - teller distortion . </S>",
    "<S> uhf calculations tend to underestimate exchange constants in lamno@xmath0 , but have the correct sign when compared with values obtained by neutron scattering ; exchange constants obtained from ci calculations are in good agreement with neutron scattering data provided the madelung potential of the cluster is appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> cluster ci calculations reveal a strong dependence of exchange constants on mn d e@xmath4 orbital populations in both compounds . </S>",
    "<S> ci wave functions are analysed in order to determine which exchange processes are important in exchange coupling in camno@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 . </S>"
