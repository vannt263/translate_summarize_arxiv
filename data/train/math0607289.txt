    "this section contains a new proof of previously known results on the poisson operad .",
    "this proof provides a simple model of a more complicated proof for the bi - hamiltonian operad and is organised similarly .",
    "the results of this section are not new ; they are included to make the proofs more structured and self - contained .",
    "we start with the operad @xmath35 .",
    "it is known that @xmath74 ( for an operadic proof of this fact , see @xcite ) .",
    "so to obtain a monomial basis in @xmath75 , we need to find a spanning set of monomials of cardinality @xmath76 in this space .",
    "the following lemma is classical .",
    "[ liebas ] the elements @xmath77 with @xmath78 span the space @xmath75 .    the jacobi identity , written in the form @xmath79 allows us to decrease the degree ( number of generators used ) of the left argument of each bracket .",
    "hence , by induction on the degree of the left argument , we can rewrite any monomial as a linear combination of monomials @xmath80 . using the skew symmetry of the bracket",
    ", we can assume at each step that the generator @xmath81 stays in the right argument , and the lemma follows by induction on @xmath32 .",
    "denote the set of all elements from lemma  [ liebas ] by @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that this set is a basis for the component @xmath75 .",
    "since the poisson operad is obtained from the operads @xmath34 and @xmath35 by a distributive law , we have an isomorphism of  @xmath83-modules @xmath84 ( see @xcite ) , and thus we have    the set @xmath85 of monomials @xmath86 , where @xmath87 ( for partitions @xmath30=a_1\\sqcup \\ldots\\sqcup a_k$ ] with @xmath88 ) , is a basis of  @xmath89 .",
    "[ n - fact ] the dimension of the space @xmath89 is equal to @xmath90 .",
    "since the @xmath83-modules @xmath36 and @xmath91 are isomorphic , the exponential generating series @xmath92 is equal to the composition @xmath93 which is exactly the exponential generating function for @xmath94 .",
    "from the combinatorial point of view we can say that @xmath76 is the number of cycles on @xmath30 $ ] , while the composition with @xmath34 corresponds to a combinatorial structure obtained by partitioning a set and taking a cycle on each part of the partition .",
    "these structures are in one - to - one correspondence with permutations ( decompositions into disjoint cycles ) , so the number of objects of this type is equal to @xmath90 .      here",
    "we prove that @xmath90 is an upper bound for the dimension of  @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we prove the following more general statement .",
    "[ upperbound ] let @xmath96 be an associative commutative algebra with generators @xmath2 , @xmath97 , and relations @xmath98 for some @xmath99 .",

    "each connected component of  @xmath72 ( which is a graph on a subset @xmath104 $ ] ) is obtained from a linear reordering of  @xmath105 such that the maximal element of  @xmath105 remains maximal : from each element , edges go to its neighbours with respect to the ordering .    to prove that these monomials span the algebra , we begin with the following lemma .    under the conditions of proposition  [ upperbound ] ,",
    "the monomial @xmath73 vanishes unless @xmath72 is a forest .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath106 if @xmath72 contains a cycle .",
    "we prove this by induction on the number of edges of the shortest cycle in @xmath72 .",
    "if this number is equal to @xmath107 , @xmath72 has a multiple edge , and we use the relation @xmath108 .",
    "if the length is greater than @xmath107 , consider two adjacent edges @xmath109 and @xmath110 of the cycle .",
    "since @xmath111 , the monomial @xmath73 is equal to a linear combination of two monomials , each corresponding to a graph that has a cycle of smaller length .",
    "thus to prove the proposition , we need to rewrite monomials corresponding to a tree as linear combinations of the monomials introduced above .",
    "consider a tree @xmath112 .",
    "let the vertex with maximal label be the root of  @xmath112 .",
    "consider the induced orientation of the tree ( the edge @xmath109 is oriented from @xmath66 to @xmath67 if the path from the root to @xmath67 goes via @xmath66 ) .",
    "we prove our statement by induction on the distance @xmath113 from the root to the nearest vertex having at least two outgoing ( directed ) edges and , for a fixed @xmath113 , on the number @xmath114 of outgoing edges of this vertex .",
    "namely , we describe a procedure that rewrites a monomial as a linear combination of monomials corresponding to graphs with larger @xmath113 or the same @xmath113 and smaller @xmath114 .",
    "it is clear that iterations of such a procedure lead to a linear combination of the monomials introduced above .",
    "so fix @xmath115 and let @xmath66 be a vertex at distance @xmath113 having at least two outgoing edges @xmath116 and @xmath117 . using the relation @xmath118 we replace the corresponding monomial by a linear combination of two monomials where @xmath66 has fewer outgoing edges .",
    "the number of elements in the spanning set can be computed in several ways . to make the proof similar to the case of the bi - hamiltonian operad",
    ", we provide a bijection  @xmath119 between this set and the basis of the component of the poisson operad .",
    "notice that our bases of components of the lie operad can be described recursively : each element is a bracket @xmath120 , where @xmath121 and @xmath122 belongs to a basis for a `` smaller '' component .",
    "this recursive definition immediately gives us a recursive definition for a bijection : take the tree corresponding to @xmath122 , take its vertex @xmath67 corresponding to the uppermost generator in @xmath122 ( i.e. , such that @xmath123 ) and connect this vertex to @xmath66 with an edge .",
    "combinatorially , if we draw the trees in the plane in a way that at each vertex the subtree containing @xmath32 is the rightmost one , we see that leaves of our tree are arranged in a chain according to their height ( @xmath32 is the lowest ) , and we join the corresponding vertices with edges according to the order in this chain ( see the picture ) .",
    "@xmath124{pic.3.eps}\\ ] ] finally , we extend this correspondence on forests by taking the disjoint union of images of the trees in the forest .",
    "the upper bound @xmath90 that we have obtained is not sharp for a generic algebra @xmath96 . to prove that it is sharp for @xmath5 , we use operadic arguments .",
    "namely , we introduce a pairing between the vector spaces @xmath5 and @xmath89 and then use this pairing to show that the spanning set from the previous section is in fact linearly independent .",
    "we define this pairing in two equivalent ways : one using a structure of a cooperad on the collection of algebras @xmath5 and the other one using a structure of a hopf operad on @xmath36 .",
    "let us begin with the cooperadic definition .",
    "take an element @xmath125 .",
    "define an algebra homomorphism @xmath126 by the formulae @xmath127    for each @xmath28 , @xmath128 the homomorphism @xmath129 is well defined ( that is , the relations are mapped to zero ) .",
    "the mappings @xmath129 obviously satisfy the coassociativity type relations for the cooperadic cocomposition , so the collection of the dual spaces @xmath130 acquires a structure of an operad .",
    "the binary operations of this operad satisfy the relations of  @xmath36 .",
    "thus there exists a mapping @xmath131 from @xmath36 to the collection @xmath130 .",
    "it maps the product @xmath132 to the linear function dual to @xmath133 and maps the bracket @xmath134 to the linear function dual to @xmath135 .",
    "define a pairing @xmath136 by @xmath137",
    ".    this definition can be explained in a combinatorial way .",
    "take an @xmath63-forest @xmath138 and an @xmath7-forest @xmath72 .",
    "define a partial mapping @xmath139 from the set of edges of  @xmath72 to the set of vertices of  @xmath138 as follows .",
    "given an edge @xmath140 , take the leaves @xmath66 and @xmath67 of  @xmath138 .",
    "if they do not belong to the same component of  @xmath138 , then the mapping is not defined on  @xmath141 . otherwise , consider for each of these leaves the path to the root of the corresponding connected component .",
    "let @xmath142 be the first common vertex of these paths",
    ". then @xmath143 .",
    "[ pm1 ] the value of the pairing @xmath144 is nonzero iff the map @xmath139 is a bijection between the set of all edges of  @xmath72 and the set of all internal vertices of  @xmath138 .",

    "first of all , we apply the cocompositions in the cooperad dual to the poisson operad to obtain an element of  @xmath147 .",
    "this space is identified with the space @xmath148 .",
    "finally , this space is mapped to @xmath149 by the mapping which is dual to the corresponding cocomposition .",
    "thus to each bracket in an operadic monomial the mapping @xmath131 assigns a generator in an algebraic monomial that corresponds to this bracket .",
    "one can easily see that this correspondence gives exactly the inverse to the mapping @xmath139 .",
    "the statement on the value of the pairing in the bijective case is clear .    another way to define the pairing originates from the hopf operad structure on @xmath36 which we define now .",
    "namely , we construct a coassociative morphism @xmath150 ( while all the properties of a hopf operad hold , for us only the coassociativity property is important ) . for our purposes , the previous definition of the pairing is sufficient , but this hopf approach to constructing the pairing can be used to obtain the exact formulae for the @xmath145 s above .",
    "let @xmath151 be defined by the formulae @xmath152 extend @xmath153 by the rule @xmath154 .",
    "the following lemma is straightforward .",
    "the ( coassociative ) morphism @xmath153 is well - defined .",
    "it follows that each vector space @xmath155 has the structure of an associative algebra .",

    "this pairing is well - defined , i.e. , it vanishes on all the ( operadic and algebraic ) relations .",
    "@xmath162 .",
    "we begin with a definition of a linear ordering of the spanning set @xmath103 ( and thus a linear ordering of  @xmath85 via the bijection @xmath119 ) .",
    "after that we show that the matrix of the pairing between @xmath85 and @xmath103 is non - degenerate : for our orderings it turns out to be upper triangular ( and in fact diagonal ) with nonzero entries on the diagonal .",

    "we say that the first element is greater than the second if the corresponding partition is greater with respect to the ordering @xmath163 .",
