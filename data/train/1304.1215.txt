    "quantum and thermal fluctuations of charges in otherwise neutral bodies lead to stochastic electromagnetic ( em ) fields everywhere in space . in systems at equilibrium",
    ", these fluctuations give rise to casimir forces ( generalizations of van  der  waals interactions between macroscopic bodies ) that have recently become the subject of intense theoretical and experimental work.@xcite in non - equilibrium situations involving bodies at different temperatures , these fields also mediate energy exchange from the hotter to the colder bodies , a process known as _ radiative heat transfer_. although the basic theoretical formalism for studying heat transfer was laid out decades ago  @xcite only recently have experiments reached the precision required to measure them at the microscale,@xcite sparking renewed interest in the study of these interactions in complex geometries that deviate from the simple parallel - plate structures of the past.@xcite in this manuscript , we present a novel formulation of radiative heat transfer for arbitrary geometries based on the well - known surface - integral - equation ( sie ) formulation of classical electromagnetism,@xcite which extends our recently developed fluctuating surface - current ( fsc ) approach to equilibrium casimir forces  @xcite to the non - equilibrium problem of energy transfer between bodies of inequal temperatures . unlike scattering formulations based on basis expansions of the field unknowns best suited to special  @xcite or non - interleaved periodic @xcite geometries , or formulations based on expensive , brute - force time - domain simulations@xcite and green s functions calculations ,  @xcite this approach allows direct application of the boundary element method ( bem ) : a mature and sophisticated sie formulation of the scattering problem in which the em fields are determined by the solution of an algebraic equation involving a smaller set of surface unknowns ( fictitious surface currents in the surfaces of the objects  @xcite ) .",
    "a terse derivation of our fsc formulation for heat transfer was previously published in ref .  .",
    "the primary goals of this paper are to provide a more detailed presentation of this derivation and to generalize our previous formula for the heat transfer between two bodies to other situations of interest , including geometries consisting of multiple and/or nested bodies .",
    "we also demonstrate that the fsc framework can be applied as a spectral method to obtain semi - analytical formulas in special geometries with high symmetry , as well as for purely numerical evaluation using bem , which we exploit to obtain new results in a number of complicated geometries that prove challenging for semi - analytical calculations .",
    "although our formulation here employs similar guiding principles as our previous work on equilibrium casimir phenomena  @xcite  both are based on the sie framework of classical em scattering  the heat - transfer case is by no means a straightforward extension of force calculations , because generalizing the equilibrium framework to non - equilibrium situations requires very different theoretical techniques .",
    "for example , the fact that in ref .   we considered only _ equilibrium _ fluctuations made it possible for us to directly exploit the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for em fields,@xcite which relates the field ",
    "field correlation function at two points to a _",
    "green s function between those two points .",
    "in contrast , although a fluctuation - dissipation theorem exists in the non - equilibrium problem , the field ",
    "field correlation functions are in this case determined by a product of two green s functions integrated over the volumes of the bodies.@xcite a key step in our derivation below is a correspondence between this volume integral ( involving products of fields ) and an equivalent surface integral involving the fictitious surface currents and fields of the sie framework , that was not required in the equilibrium case .",
    "the heat radiation and heat transfer of bodies with sizes and/or separations comparable to the thermal wavelength can deviate strongly from the predictions of the stefan - boltzmann law.@xcite for instance , in the far field ( object separations @xmath0 much greater than the thermal wavelength @xmath1 ) , radiative heat transfer is dominated by the exchange of propagating waves and is thus nearly insensitive to changes in separations ( oscillations from interference effects typically being small  @xcite ) . in the less - studied near field regime ( @xmath2 ) , not only are interference effects important , but otherwise - negligible evanescent waves also contribute flux through tunneling.@xcite such near - field effects have been most commonly studied in planar geometries , where the monotonically increasing contribution of evanescent waves with decreasing @xmath0 results in orders - of - magnitude enhancement of the net radiative heat transfer rate ( exceeding the far - field black - body limit at sub - micron separations  @xcite ) .",
    "this enhancement was predicted theoretically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite decades ago in various planar structures , and has recently become the subject of increased attention due to its potential application in nanotechnology , with ramifications for thermal photovoltaics  @xcite and thermal rectification,@xcite nanolithography,@xcite thermally assisted magnetic recording,@xcite and high - resolution surface imaging.@xcite thus far , there have been numerous works focused on the effects of material choice in planar bodies,@xcite including studies of graphene sheets,@xcite hyperbolic  @xcite and anisotropic materials,@xcite and even materials exhibiting phase transitions,@xcite to name a few . along the same lines ,",
    "many authors have explored transfer mediated by surface polaritons in thin films@xcite and 1d - periodic planar bodies.@xcite despite decades of research , little is known about the near - field heat transfer characteristics of bodies whose shapes differ significantly from these planar , unpatterned structures .",
    "theoretical calculations were only recently extended to handle more complicated geometries , including spheres,@xcite cylinders,@xcite and cones@xcite suspended above slabs , dipoles interacting with other dipoles@xcite or with surfaces,@xcite and also patterned / periodic surfaces.@xcite    general - purpose methods for modelling heat transfer between bodies of arbitrary shapes can be distinguished in at least two ways , in the abstract _ formulation _ of the heat - transfer problem and in the _ basis _ used to `` discretize '' the formulation into a finite number of unknowns for solution on a computer ( or by hand).@xcite theoretical work on heat transfer has mainly centered on `` scattering - matrix '' formulations which express the heat transfer in terms of the matrices relating incoming and outgoing wave solutions from each body.@xcite these formulations tend to be closely associated with `` spectral '' discretization techniques , in which a fourier - like basis ( fourier series , spectral harmonics , etc . ) is used to expand the unknowns , because the incoming / outgoing waves must be expressed in terms of known solutions of maxwell s equations , which are typically a spectral basis of planewaves , spherical waves , and so on .",
    "such a spectral basis has the advantage that it can be extremely efficient ( exponentially convergent ) if the basis is specially designed for the geometry at hand ( e.g. spherical waves for spherical bodies@xcite ) .",
    "scattering - matrix methods can also be used for arbitrary geometries , e.g. by expanding arbitrary periodic structures in fourier series@xcite or by coupling to a generic grid / mesh discretization to solve the scattering problems,@xcite but exponential convergence no longer generally obtains .",
    "furthermore , fourier or spherical - harmonic bases of incoming / outgoing waves correspond to uniform angular / spatial resolution and require a separating plane / sphere between bodies , which can be a disadvantage for interleaved bodies or bodies with corners or other features favoring nonuniform resolution .",
    "in contrast to the geometric specificity encoded in a particular scattering basis , one extremely generic approach is a brute - force discretization of space and time , allowing one to solve for heat - transfer by a langevin approach  @xcite that handles all geometries equally , including geometries with continuously varying material properties .",
    "the fsc approach lies midway between these two extremes . like the scattering - matrix approach",
    ", the fsc approach exploits the fact that one knows the em solutions ( green s functions ) analytically in homogeneous regions , so for piecewise - homogeneous geometries the only remaining task is to match boundary conditions at interfaces . unlike the scattering - matrix approach ,",
    "however , the fsc approach is formulated in terms of unknown surface currents rather than incoming / outgoing waves  the surface currents are arbitrary vector fields and need not satisfy any wave equation , which leads to great flexibility in the choice of basis . as described in this paper , the fsc formulation can use either a spectral basis or a generic grid / mesh and , as demonstrated in  ref .   and ref .",
    ", works equally well for interleaved bodies ( lacking a separating plane or even a well - defined notion of `` incoming / outgoing '' wave solutions ) .",
    "moreover , the fsc formulation reduces the heat - transfer problem to a simple trace formula in terms of well - studied matrices that arise in sie formulations of classical em , which allows mature bem solvers to be exploited with minimal additional computational effort .",

    "<S> we show that our formulation can be applied as a spectral method to obtain fast - converging semi - analytical formulas in high - symmetry geometries using specialized spectral bases that conform to the surfaces of the bodies ( e.g. fourier series for planar bodies or spherical harmonics for spherical bodies ) , and can also be employed as a numerical method by exploiting the generality of surface meshes / grids to obtain results in more complicated geometries ( e.g. interleaved bodies as well as bodies with sharp corners ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our formalism allows direct application of the boundary - element method , a robust and powerful numerical implementation of the surface - integral formulation of classical electromagnetism , which we use to obtain results in new geometries , such as the heat transfer between finite slabs , cylinders , and cones . </S>"
