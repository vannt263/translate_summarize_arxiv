    "in recent years much progress has been achieved in the understanding of various aspects of the scaling limit of the two - dimensional ising model , which is known as the ising field theory ( ift ) , for a review see @xcite .",

    "the particle sector of ift contains one spinless fermion , which is interpreted in the ordered @xmath26 phase as a kink interpolating between two degenerate vacua .",
    "application of magnetic field removes the degeneracy and induces a long - range interaction between kinks , which leads to their confinement into pairs .",

    "is described .",
    "we study the bound - spinon spectrum in this model by means of two different procedures , which are shown to be effective in the ift @xcite . in section [ sbound ]",
    "we apply a heuristic approach based on the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule .",
    "results obtained in section [ sbound ] are confirmed and extended in more systematic theory in subsequent sections . in section [ s2fa ]",
    "we derive a singular integral equation , which determines the energy spectrum of bound - spinons in the two - fermion approximation , and generalizes to the discrete spin chain model the ift bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "section [ sec5 ] contains some technical results relating to the singular integral equation ( [ ieq ] ) . in section [ toy ]",
    "we derive exact solutions of two simplified versions of this equation , and give explicit expressions for the corresponding bound - spinon energy spectra . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we return to the original integral equation ( [ ieq ] ) , and develop for it a weak coupling perturbative expansion based on the results of section [ sec5 ] . the lowest order of this expansion leads to eight different small-@xmath5 asymptotics for the bound - spinon dispersion law , which can be used in different regions of the bound spinon quasimomentum and energy .",
    "obtained results are discussed in section [ dis ] .",
