    "we seek to formulate a simple covering system for the odd integers such that every odd integer may be represented by exactly one of the residue classes @xmath10 and each residue class is a finite ( or infinite ) collection ( i.e. , reordered set ) of integers congruent to any member of the set @xmath11 .",
    "the covering system sought for the proposed collatz number systems must be 1-cover , i.e. , covers every integer exactly once .",
    "one of the objectives of this proposition is to develop a complete recategorisation of odd numbers based on both their residue classes and collatz profiles ( i.e. , according to their @xmath12 divisibility properties after multiplying them by 3 and adding 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath13 represent the total stopping time of an integer @xmath9 under the collatz system , where the symbol `` @xmath14 '' refers to `` number of iterations it takes to get to 1 '' starting from the input @xmath9 - this is often referred to as the total stopping time of @xmath9 .",
