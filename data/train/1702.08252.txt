    "as is the case of the solar system , moons and planetary rings are believed to exist in exoplanetary systems as well .",
    "their detection , however , has not yet been successful , and remains as one of the most attractive , albeit challenging , goals in exoplanetary sciences .",
    "a notable exception includes a system of giant circumplanetary rings of j1407b ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the inferred radius @xmath0 au implies that it is very different from saturnian rings that we focus on in the present paper .",
    "in addition to the obvious importance of the ring discovery itself , its detection offers an interesting method to determine the direction of the planetary spin because the ring axis is supposed to be aligned with the planetary spin as in the case of saturn .",
    "thus the detection of ring parameters yield a fairly complete set of dynamical architecture of transiting planetary systems ; the stellar spin via asteroseismology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gravity darkening ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the planetary orbit via transiting photometry and the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , and the planetary spin through the ring detection as discussed here .",
    "the direct detection of planetary spin is very difficult , and so far only four possible signals related to planetary spins have been reported : the periodic flux variations of 2m1207b @xcite , and a rotational broadening and/or distortion of the line profile of @xmath1 pictoris b @xcite , hd 189733b @xcite , and gq lupi b @xcite .",
    "these interesting planets are very young and have sufficiently high temperature ( @xmath2 k ) for their spin to be detected .",
    "in contrast , the same technique is not easily applicable for mature and cold planets like saturn .",
    "thus the detection of the ring axis provides a complementary methodology to determine the spin of more typical planets with low temperature .",
    "since the total mass of planetary rings is small , they do not exhibit any observable signature on the dynamics of the system .",
    "instead , high - precision photometry and spectroscopy offer a promising approach towards their detection , and , observations of reflected light and transit are especially useful for this purpose .",
    "possible signatures in reflected light due to the planetary rings include the higher brightness , the characteristic phase function , distinctive spectral variations , temporary extinction of the planet , and discrepancy between reflection and thermal radiation intensities .",
    "for instance , attempted to explain the line broadening of the reflected light of 51 peg b with a ringed planet model , and they conclude that it is not due to the ring .",
    "this is because their solution requires a non - coplanar configuration , which would be unlikely for short - period planets .",
    "searches for rings through the light reflection of the host star can be made for non - transiting planets even though their signals are typically small .",
    "therefore , while we focus on the transit photometry in the rest of this paper , the reflected - light method is indeed useful and complementary as well .",
    "@xcite is the first to propose the transit photometry as a tool for the ring detection .",
    "@xcite derived the upper limit on the radius of a possible ring around hd 209458 b. @xcite improved the model of @xcite by incorporating the influence of diffraction on the light curves .",
    "they claimed that the saturn - like ring system can be detected with the photometric precision of the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the combination of the transit photometry and the spectroscopic rossiter - mclaughin effect increases the detection efficiency and the credibility of the signal .",
    "@xcite proposed that an anomalously large planet radius indicated from transit photometry can be used to select candidates for ringed planets .",
    "they also proposed that the anomalous stellar density estimated from the transit may be used as a probe of a ring .",
    "in addition to the above methodology papers , a systematic search for ring systems using real data was conducted by @xcite .",
    "they analyzed 21 short - period planets ( @xmath3 days ) in the _ kepler _ photometric data , and found no appreciable signatures of rings around the systems .",
    "this is an interesting attempt , but their null detection is not surprising because the ring tends to be unstable as the planet gets closer to the central star .",
    "in addition , @xcite demonstrated that it is hard to detect the ring at below 0.1 au in the case of solar - like stars .",
    "instead , we attempt here a systematic search for rings around long - period planet candidates that exhibit single or a few transit - like signals in the _ kepler _ photometric data . since rings around those planets",
    ", if exist , should be dynamically stable , even a null detection would eventually put an interesting constraint on the formation efficiency and properties of icy rings for those plantetary environments .",
    "the purposes of the paper are three - fold ; to establish a methodology for the discovery of potential ringed planets , to apply the methodology to a catalog of long - period planet candidates from _ kepler _ , and to detect and/or constrain the possible ringed planets .",
    "section 2 presents our simple model of a ringed planet , and describes the expected transit signal . in section 3",
    ", we explain how to select target objects for our search , and classify them into four groups according to the amplitude and nature of the signal - to - noise ratio of their light curves relative to the expected signature by possible ringed planets . in section 4 ,",
    "we place upper limits on ring parameters for seven systems with a good signal - to - noise ratio . in section 5 , we select five tentative ringed - planet candidates from the high signal candidates classified in section 3 . while four out of the five are likely to be false positives , one system , kic 10403228 , passes all the selection criteria that we impose . therefore we attempt a systematic parameter survey for the possible ring around kic 10403228 in section 6 .",
    "also we examine and discuss various other possibilities that may explain the observed ring - like anomaly .",
    "final section is devoted to conclusion and future prospects .",
    "our simple model of a ringed planet adopted in this paper basically follows @xcite .",
    "the ring is circular , and has a constant optical depth @xmath4 everywhere between the inner and outer radii of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we denote the radii of the star and planet by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the configuration of the planet and ring during a transit is illustrated in figure [ model ] .",
    "the @xmath9-axis is approximately aligned with the projected orbit of the planet on the stellar disk , and the @xmath10-axis is towards the observer .",
    "this completes the @xmath11 coordinate frame centered at the origin of the ringed planet ( left panel in figure [ model ] ) .",
    "the normal vector of the ring plane is characterized by the two angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a spherical coordinate ( right panel in figure [ model ] ) .",
    "we also set up another coordinate system @xmath14 centered at the origin of the star in such a way that the major and minor axes of the projected ring are defined to be parallel with @xmath15- and @xmath16-axes , respectively , with @xmath17-axis being towards the observer .",
    "the ring is assumed to move along the planetary orbit with constant obliquity angles @xmath18 , and the planet is assumed to move on a keplerian orbit around the star .",
    "the left panel in figure [ model ] illustrates the transit of the ringed planet , whose impact parameter is @xmath19 .",
    "is shifted from the center of the planet to that of the star .",
    "the radius of the star is @xmath7 , the radius of the planet is @xmath8 and the impact parameter of the planet is @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath17-axis and the @xmath10-axis are toward the observer .",
    "( right ) enlarged view of the planet with the ring . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the inner and outer radii of the ring respectively .",
    "the obliquity angle @xmath12 and azimuthal angle @xmath13 are defined with respect to @xmath11-coordinate .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   is shifted from the center of the planet to that of the star .",
    "the radius of the star is @xmath7 , the radius of the planet is @xmath8 and the impact parameter of the planet is @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath17-axis and the @xmath10-axis are toward the observer .",
    "( right ) enlarged view of the planet with the ring . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the inner and outer radii of the ring respectively .",
    "the obliquity angle @xmath12 and azimuthal angle @xmath13 are defined with respect to @xmath11-coordinate .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we assume a thin uniform ring with a constant optical depth @xmath4 for the light from the direction normal to the ring plane .",
    "thus the fraction of the background stellar light transmitted through the inclined ring is given by @xmath20 , and we define the shading parameter @xmath21 as @xmath22 . in our simple ring model ,",
    "the value of @xmath21 , instead of @xmath4 , fully specifies the effective optical transparency of the ring .    in summary ,",
    "our simple ring model is characterized by five parameters ; four ( @xmath23 ) specify the geometry of the ring , the other is a shading parameter @xmath21 . instead of @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", we use dimensionless parameters in fitting , : @xmath24      the stellar intensity profile @xmath25 under the assumption of the quadratic limb darkening law is expressed in terms of two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28   \\left ( \\text { $ \\mu \\equiv \\sqrt{1-\\cfrac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{r_{\\star}^{2}}}$}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the intensity at the center of the star . the physical conditions on the profile require the following complex constraints on @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath30 in this paper , we adopt @xmath31 and @xmath32 instead of ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) following @xcite . then , equations ( [ one ] ) and ( [ two ] ) are rewritten as @xmath35,\\ ] ] @xmath36 in this parametrization , @xmath37 and @xmath38 vary independently between 0 and 1 .",
    "this is useful in finding best - fit parameters @xcite . for reference ,",
    "the sun has @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath43 be the blocked fraction of light coming from the location on the stellar disk @xmath44 . due to the motion of the planet during a transit ,",
    "@xmath43 is time - dependent and given as @xmath45 then the normalized flux from the the system is given by @xmath46 where the second term indicates the fraction of light blocked by a transiting ringed planet , and the total flux is @xmath47.\\ ] ] we develop a reliable numerical integration method that solves the boundary lines of @xmath43 as described in appendix a. our method achieves the numerical error less than @xmath48 in relative flux , and this is much smaller than a typical noise of the _ kepler _ photometric data .",
    "we briefly comment on three effects that we neglect in the analysis below ; finite binning during exposure time , planetary precession , and forward - scattering of the ring .",
    "while all of them are negligible for the saturnian ringed planet with a long period , they may become important in other situations .    for the precise comparison of our light - curve predictions against the _ kepler _ long cadence",
    ", we may have to take account of the finite exposure time ( 29.4 min ) properly .",
    "in fact , the binning effect is shown to bias the transit parameter estimate in the case of short - period planets @xcite . for long - period planets that we focus on here , however , the transit duration is sufficiently longer than the finite exposure time .",
    "thus the binning effect is not important . in the case of the transit of saturn in front of the sun , for instance ,",
    "the fractional difference of the relative flux is typically an order of @xmath49 between models with and without the binning effect .",
    "this value is an order - of - magnitude smaller than the expected noise in the _ kepler _ photometric data .",
    "thus we can safely neglect the binning effect in the present analysis .",
    "the precession of a planetary spin would generate observable seasonal effects on the transit shape of a ringed planet @xcite .",
    "since our current target systems are extracted from those with a single transit , however , we can ignore the effect ; the period of the precession is proportional to the square of the orbital period , and thus the precession effect during a transit is entirely negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we note here that this could be an interesting probe of the dynamics of short - period ringed planetary systems that exhibit multiple transits .    in the present analysis",
    ", we consider the effect of light - blocking alone due to the ring during its transit . in reality , forward scattering ( diffraction by the ring particles ) may increase the flux of the background light .",
    "let us consider light from the star to the observer through the ring particle with diameter @xmath50 .",
    "first , light is emitted from the disk of the star , and arrives at the ring particles .",
    "the angular radius of the star viewed from the ring particles is about @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , and @xmath7 is the stellar radius .",
    "next , the light is diffracted by the ring particles , and the extent of the diffraction is described by the phase function @xcite ; the rough diffraction angle can be estimated from the first zero of the phase function @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is wavelength of light . in particular , the effect of the diffraction becomes significant when the viewing angle @xmath51 is comparable to the diffraction angle .",
    "let us define the critical particle size @xmath55 by equating @xmath51 with @xmath56 ; @xmath57 @xcite discussed the effect of diffraction using @xmath55 . when @xmath58 , the diffraction angle is small , and light just behind the ring particles is diffracted to the observer . in this case",
    ", the diffraction does not affect the direction of light , and we may express the extinction due to absorption with a single parameter @xmath21 .    when @xmath59 , the diffraction angle is large , and the ring particles diffract light to wider directions .",
    "then , the amount of light that reaches the observer significantly decreases , and we may model the extinction in terms of @xmath21 .    in both cases , @xmath58 and @xmath60 , the extinction can be modeled with a single parameter @xmath21 . in the case of saturn with the typical particle diameter @xmath61 cm , for instance , @xmath62 mm from equation ( [ d_crit ] ) satisfies @xmath63 ,",
    "so our model can be used to calculate the light curves of saturn observed far from the solar system .",
    "we should note that when the typical size of particles satisfies @xmath64 , the forward scattering induces the rise in the light curve before the ingress and after the egress , and this effect can become the key to identify the signatures of the rings out of other physical signals . incorporating the diffraction into the model , however , requires intensive computation , and this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in what follows , we present our methodology to search for planetary rings in the real data .",
    "figure [ flow ] shows the flow chart of the analysis procedure and its application .",
    "methods in each step of the chart are described along with the results of analysis in the following sections .",
    "( d ) , model i is adopted in table [ sec3_ring ] . ]    in this section , we first choose target objects found in the _ kepler _ field . then , we classify them into four categories depending on the observed anomalies in the light curves .",
    "the details of classification procedure may be found in appendices b and c.      the _ kepler _ mission monitored more than 150,000 stars over four years , and identified about 8,000 planet candidates as _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on long - period planet candidates because icy ring particles as observed around saturn are supposed to survive only at locations far from the host star . considering that the temperature of the snow line is @xmath65 k @xcite",
    ", we choose 37 kois whose equilibrium temperatures are less than 200 k. in addition , we selected planet candidates reported by recent transit surveys ; 41 candidates from a search by @xcite and 28 candidates from @xcite . in table",
    "[ table_num ] , the numbers of planetary candidates in three groups are listed with the number of transits .",
    "we exclude several systems , which are not suited for our search . for koi-5574.01 in kois and kic 2158850 in @xcite",
    ", we can not find the transit signal among the noisy light curves .",
    "for koi-959.01 in kois with @xmath66 days and kic 8540376 in @xcite with @xmath67 days , we can not neglect the binning effect due to the short transit duration . after removing these systems ,",
    "89 planet candidates are left in total for our search .",
    "tables [ table_num ] summarizes the number of targets , and figure [ benzu ] shows the overlapped objects among kois , @xcite , and @xcite      inevitably a signature of a possible ring around a planet is very tiny .",
    "long - period planet candidates exhibit a small number of transits ( table [ table_num ] ) , and the precision of the transit light curves is not improved so much by folding the multiple events .",
    "therefore the search for a possible ring signature crucially relies on the quality of the few transiting light curves for individual systems .    according to the automated procedures described in appendices b and c , we classify the long - period planet candidates into the following four categories .",
    "= 0pt    \\(a ) insufficient @xmath68 to constrain ring parameters : +  since the anomalous feature due to the ring is very subtle , one can not constrain the ring parameters at all if the intrinsic light - curve variation of the host is too large to be explained by any ring model .",
    "thus we exclude those systems that exhibit a noisy light curve out - of - transit .",
    "the exclusion criteria depend on the adopted ring model to some extent , but are determined largely by the threshold signal - to - noise ratio @xmath69 that we set as @xmath70 . for definiteness , we consider 4 different ring models ( table [ sec3_ring ] ) , and the details of the procedure are described in appendices b and c.    \\(b ) sufficient @xmath68 and no significant anomaly : +   a fraction of the systems has a sufficiently good @xmath68 and exhibits no significant anomaly . in such a case , we can put physically meaningful constraints on the possible ring parameters ( section 4 ) .",
    "\\(c ) too large anomaly for a ringed planet : +  in contrast to ( b ) , some systems exhibit a large anomaly in the transiting light curve that exceeds the prediction in the adopted ring models .",
    "nevertheless , different ring models may be able to explain the anomaly , and we still continue to search for ringed planets in this category ( section 5 ) .",
    "\\(d ) reasonable anomaly for a ringed planet +  finally a small number of systems with a good @xmath68 indeed exhibit a possible signature that could be explained by the ring model .",
    "we perform additional analysis to test the validity of the ring hypothesis in a more quantitative fashion ( section 5 and 6 ) .",
    "= 13pt    the above classification is done on the basis of observed anomalies , which are derived by fitting a planet model to light curves .",
    "the data are taken form the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , and we use the simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data taken in the long - cadence mode ( 29.4 min ) . in fitting , we use only the first transit in the light curve for each candidate in deriving the observed anomaly for simplicity .",
    "after fitting the planet model to data , the long - period planet candidates are automatically classified into the above categories ( a)@xmath71(d ) .",
    "table [ sec3_ring ] summarizes the results of classification for four models . in a later section",
    ", we use the classification according to model i , which contains more candidates in categories ( b)@xmath71(d ) than the other three .",
    "in fact , the choice of model i is partly reasonable because the distant planets potentially have tilted rings like saturn because of low tidal force .",
    "as candidates in ( a ) have insufficient @xmath68 for further analysis , we do not consider them in the following analysis . in section 4 ,",
    "we obtain upper limits on @xmath72 for candidates in ( b ) . in section 5 , we first search for the ringed planets in categories ( c ) and ( d ) by visual inspection , and later examine the reliability of transits more quantitatively . in section 6 ,",
    "we interpret the possible ringed planet candidate .    [ sec3_ring ]",
    "upper limits on @xmath73 are given for candidates in ( b ) as a result of classification .",
    "figure [ class_b ] shows the light curves and fitted curves of eight candidates classified to ( b ) in model i. they show no appreciable anomalies in the residual relative to the single planet model . for these candidates",
    ", we could detect the ring signature if exists . thus in turn , we can derive the upper limits on @xmath73 .",
    "this is done by simply comparing the expected anomaly in model i and the observed anomaly in the light curve .",
    "the details of the method to place upper limits on @xmath73 are described in appendix b and c , and the results are summarized in table [ table_d ] .",
    "[ table_d ]",
    "in this section , we search for ringed planets in categories ( c ) and ( d ) , extract the tentative ringed planet candidates , and examine whether the transits are not false positive .",
    "figures [ class_c ] and [ class_d ] show the light curves of candidates in categories ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "candidates in ( c ) , where the observed anomaly exceeds the prediction of model i , may be consistent with other ringed planets in different configurations .",
    "thus , we search for ringed planets not only in ( d ) but also ( c ) .",
    "we extract ringed planet candidates by visual inspection of their light curves on the basis of following properties expected for ringed planets :    * duration of ingress and/or egress is long .",
    "* transit shape is asymmetric due to the non - zero @xmath13 .    as a result",
    ", we identify five systems koi-771(d ) , koi-1032(c ) , koi-1192(d ) , koi-3145(d ) , and kic 10403228(d ) as tentative ringed planets . for the other four candidates in ( d ) , which show no visible ring - like feature in the light curves , we obtain the upper limits on @xmath73 in the same method as in the previous section ( table [ table_d ] ) . in total",
    ", we obtain the upper limits on @xmath73 for 12 candidates , and the six of them have @xmath74 .    for six candidates in ( c ) with no ring - like features , we can not set the upper limits of ring parameters , and we conclude that the signals are not due to rings , but are due to the temporal stellar activities .",
    "we examine the reliability of transit signals for the five preliminary candidates . as a result",
    ", we find that four are false positives , and kic 10403228 still passes all criteria .",
    "more specifically , we regard a target as a false positive if one of the following criteria is satisfied @xcite .    1 .",
    "the target object exhibits a significant secondary eclipse , which is expected for an eclipsing binary .",
    "none of our candidates exhibits the secondary eclipse .",
    "the signal originates from the other nearby stars or instrumental noise .",
    "4 .   inspecting target pixel files , we found that the dips in the light curves of koi-1032.01 , koi-1192.01 , and koi-3145 do not come from the target stars .",

    "@xcite also pointed out that this system is false positive . for kic 10403228 ,",
    "the transit depths differ in only two pixels , while it is constant in the other pixels , so we conclude that the signal is originated from the target star",
    ". the more detailed discussion of kic 10403228 is presented in a later section .",
    "the transit simultaneously occurs at different stars in different pixels .",
    "this indicates that the signal does not originate from the target but from the instrumental noise .",
    "the transit events of koi-1032.01 and koi-1192.01 are located at the same time .",
    "this result is consistent with that of the criterion 2 . 7 .",
    "the shape of the light curve is inconsistent with that of a transiting object .",
    "8 .   from figures",
    "[ class_c ] and [ class_d ] , all signals fit well to transit - like features .",
    "kic 10403228 is the single system that passes all the criteria .",
    "thus , we move on to the detailed pixel - based analysis next .",
    "kic 10403228 is considered to be an m dwarf and has a nearby star separated by about 3 arcsec @xcite . according to the data taken by united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt )",
    ", the nearby star is located at ( ra , dec ) = @xmath75 and its j - band flux is about @xmath76 of kic 10403228 .",
    "here we examine the possibility that the transit is associated with this nearby star rather than kic 10403228 .",
    "figure [ true ] shows the light curve and fractional depth of the transit event in each of the pixels around kic 10403228 .",
    "the small transit depths in pixels a and b suggest that the source of the transit is not the nearby star shown by a red filled star , because otherwise the transit depths should be larger in those pixels close to the nearby star .",
    "to confirm this fact in a more quantitative way , we also calculate the centroid offset using the pixel - level light curves . as a result",
    ", we find that the flux centroid moves towards the nearby star during the transit and that the displacement is comparable to the value expected from the observed transit depth ( @xmath77 ) and the flux ratio in j - band ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the variation of the transit depth and the centroid displacement consistently indicate that the transit is not due to the nearby star .",
    "while we may be able to evaluate the contamination on the light curve from this nearby star more quantitatively , it does not change our conclusion in any case , and we do not perform the detailed analysis for simplicity .",
    "we note that the transit signal contains a clear short - period modulation ( panel b in figure [ true ] ) .",
    "since the modulation is not visible at panel c , it is most likely due to the nearby star . actually , there is another long - period modulation with @xmath79 days in the light curve , which may come from the target star .",
    "if these periods are related to the stellar spins , the nearby star is a fast rotating star , and the target star is a slow rotator .",
    "thus , we may ignore the effect of gravity darkening of the target star .",
    "for the further study of kic 10403228 , we present and discuss three possible models accounting for the data :  planetary ring scenario \" ,  circumstellar disk scenario \" , and  hierarchical triple scenario \" .",
    "we also discuss other possibilities than the above three models .",
    "we fit various models with and without the ring to the light curve of kic 10403228 by minimizing the value of @xmath80 defined in equation ( [ chi_def ] ) . in practice",
    ", we use @xmath81 days - time window to trim 300 data points centered around @xmath82 day ( bkjd [ = bjd@xmath83 day ] ) . to remove the long - term flux variations in the light curve ,",
    "we adopt the model in equation ( [ model_fit ] ) that is composed of a fourth - order polynomial and the transit model @xmath84 in equation ( [ genkou ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath85 is estimated to be @xmath86 from the out - of - transit data .",
    "this value is about 1.3 times larger than the error recorded in the sap data .    as the transit of kic 10403228",
    "is observed just once , we can not infer the orbital period from the timing of the transit .",
    "however , we can infer it from kepler s law .",
    "the depth and v - shape of the observed transit imply that the transiting object is relatively large and grazing .",
    "thus , we approximate the total transit duration @xmath87 as @xmath88 where the last factor is a correction term due to an eccentricity @xmath89 with @xmath90 being the argument of periapse . from kepler s law and eq ( [ duration_app ] ) , one obtains @xmath91 we obtain @xmath92 years if we adopt @xmath93 and @xmath94 days for the transit duration of kic 10403228 , and the stellar density @xmath95 g @xmath96 from @xcite .",

    "the adopted values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the typical values of _ kepler_. the frequency of planets with @xmath101 yrs would be less than 1 , so we may see @xmath102 as the optimistic upper limit of the expected value .",
    "this current value of @xmath103 is small , but not too unlikely .",

    "the stellar effective temperature @xmath123 k of kic 10403228 is taken from @xcite .",
    "since the equilibrium temperature expected from the model is much lower than the temperature @xmath65 k at the snow line @xcite , icy particles around the planet can survive against the radiation of the host star .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath124 for solution 1 implies a significantly tilted ring with respect to the orbital plane , and @xmath125 for solution 2 implies a slightly tilted ring .",
    "we examine the stability of those tilted rings on the basis of a simple tidal theory . under the assumption that the ring axis is aligned with the planetary spin ,",
    "the damping timescale of the ring axis is equal to that for the orbital and equatorial planes of the planet to be coplanar .",
    "this time - scale is given by a tidal theory : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an orbital period , @xmath128 is a dissipation factor , and @xmath129 is the second love number .",
    "if we adopt @xmath130 @xcite and @xmath131 g@xmath96 @xcite of saturn , the damping timescale is sufficiently long .",
    "thus , the best - fit configurations are consistent with the spin damping theory even under the assumption that the equatorial plane of the planet is coplanar with the ring plane .",

    "the ringed planet model is consistent with the data .",
    "however , the v - shape of the transit ( figure [ best ] ) is also a typical feature of eclipsing binaries , and the estimated period @xmath132 yrs may be too long to be detected in four years of _ kepler _ s observation ( equation ( [ eq : n_tra ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , we discuss other scenarios without a planetary ring . for this purpose , in the following , we present two possible hypotheses , which can also explain the data ; a binary with a circumstellar disk and a hierarchical triple .      in this section ,",
    "we pursue the possibility that the current transit is caused by an eclipsing - binary with a circumstellar disk rather than a planetary ring . actually , the fitting result in the previous section is also applicable to this binary scenario , so we may compare the plausibilities of the eclipsing - binary and planet scenarios to test the circumstellar disk model . for this specific purpose ,",

    "the plot shows the medians and the standard deviations of the probabilities computed from 10 sets of simulations . while the binary scenarios are more likely than the planets scenario for the shortest and the longest periods investigated here , the planets scenario is the most preferred in the intermediate region ( 10 years @xmath142 100 years ) .",
    "the result suggests that the planetary interpretation of the light curve is not so unlikely compared to the binary scenario , although there is a fair amount of probability that this is a false positive .",
    "another important implication of figure [ evid ] is that the likelihood of orbital periods in the planets scenario is much broader than what we intuitively thought before , and not sharply peaked around 450 years . while figure [ evid ] represents our final result from vespa , we point out two additional factors that may be of importance for more detailed arguments .    first , the period distribution and the overall fraction of long - period planets and binaries have not been taken into account .",
    "occurrence rate of giant planets around m dwarfs is given by @xcite .",
    "they estimated the frequency of the planets with @xmath143 to be @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 . on the other hand , @xcite estimated the multiplicity distribution of the binaries in @xmath148@xmath149 au and found the overall occurrence rate @xmath150 peaked around 10 au .",
    "these results imply that planets around m dwarfs is rarer than its stellar companion by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "this difference in the overall frequency may further increase the relative plausibility of the ebs scenario compared to the planets scenario .",
    "second , what also matters in reality is the frequency of planetary rings and circumstellar disks that produce the observed anomaly in addition to the transit signal .",
    "it is , however , far beyond our current knowledge to estimate these factors rigorously .",
    "given these difficulties , follow - up spectroscopy or high - resolution imaging would be more feasible to distinguish the ebs and planets scenarios .",
    "an eclipse due to a close binary ( rather than a single star / planet ) on a wide orbit around the primary m star is yet another possibility to explain the asymmetric and long transit - like signal observed for kic 10403228 .",
    "this is because the orbital motion of the occulting binary can produce the acceleration that modifies the in - eclipse velocity of the occulting object(s ) relative to the primary . to test this possibility",
    ", we consider a hierarchical triple system consisting of a short - period binary (  inner \" binary ) orbiting around and eclipsing the primary m star on a wide orbit (  outer \" binary ) . in the following ,",
    "we only take into account the luminosity of the occulted star and ignore the flux from the smaller binary .",
    "we also assume the orbits of both inner and outer binaries are keplerian , and use the subscripts  in \" and  out \" to denote their parameters",

    "figure [ triple ] shows one of the best - fitting models with @xmath164 days , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 days , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 days , and @xmath171 days . in this solution , we find @xmath172 , which leads to @xmath173 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath174 , which is comparable to the ringed - planet model .",
    "in this solution , the observed @xmath175 duration is reproduced despite that the value of @xmath160 is much shorter than required for the planetary scenario .",
    "this is made possible because the orbital motion of the inner binary cancels out the high orbital velocity of the outer binary .",
    "in addition to this particular solution , we find various other solutions with similar @xmath176 values for a wide range of @xmath160 . in general ,",
    "the solutions with longer @xmath160 are found to correspond to smaller @xmath177 ; for example , we find @xmath178 for @xmath179 , and @xmath180 for @xmath181 . for @xmath182 ,",
    "these mass ratios @xmath183 translate into @xmath184 .",
    "thus , in this scenario , the system can be composed of three low - mass stars or a star with a binary planet .",
    "the advantage of this scenario is that the observed long transit can be reproduced with much smaller @xmath160 than in the ringed - planet model , which leads to far higher transit / eclipse probability . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also true that the parameters need to be finely tuned to cancel the two orbital motions .",
    "while the degree of required fine tuning is crucial in comparing the evidence of this hypothesis with the planetary or stellar ring models , the evaluation of this factor is not trivial given the large parameter space .",
    "in addition , there still remain uncertainties in frequency of the hypothetical hierarchical triple ( three low - mass stars or a star with a binary planet ) . given these complexities , it is difficult to conclude whether or not this scenario is favored compared to the above two .",
    "again , the follow - up observation will be effective for the further study .",
    "so far , we present the three leading scenarios  planetary ring scenario \" ,  circumstellar disk scenario \" , and  hierarchical triple scenario \" .",
    "there still remain other possibilities that may potentially account for the light curve of kic 10403228 . in this section",
    ", we examine these possibilities and show that they are unlikely to explain the data . throughout this section",
    ", we basically assume that the transit is caused by a planet , but the results in this section are also applicable for the stellar eclipse .",
    "a significant oblateness of a single planet may mimic a ring - like anomaly during a transit .",

    "we attempt the fit of this oblate planet model to the light curve , and obtain the best - fit with @xmath188 .",
    "this value is much larger than the best - fit value @xmath189 with the model with a ring .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit oblate planet model requires the projected ellipticity of @xmath190 , where @xmath52 is the major axis , and @xmath19 is the minor axis .",
    "this solution is an unstable configuration ; the rotating object will break up due to the centrifugal force when @xmath191 ( equation ( 2.14 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the oblateness of the planet is unlikely to explain the observed anomaly .      in section 6.3",
    ", we only consider an additional motion of an occulting object due to an accompanying object .",
    "however , a transit of the accompanying object ( e.g. exomoon ) itself is yet another possibility for the peculiar light curve of kic 10043228 .",
    "as shown below , this possibility is ruled out by the shape of the anomaly .    as shown in figure [ best ] ,",
    "the anomaly in the light curve is significant only in the latter half .",
    "motivated by this fact , we fit the light curve using the planet - alone model , masking the latter half of the transit and adopting the same baseline as obtained in table [ best_table ] ( solution 2 ) ; the difference between this model and the observed light curve would represent the anomalous contributions from anything other than the main transiting planet .",
    "the result in figure [ moon ] clearly shows that the anomaly consists of a short rise in the flux followed by a more significant dip .",
    "such a feature is clearly inconsistent with the transit of an exomoon .    .",
    "the anomaly consists of a rise followed by a dip . ]      there exist anomalies specific to in - transit data ; spot crossing and gravity darkening .",
    "if the planet crosses spots on the stellar surface , the light curve is deformed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general , however , spots are dark , so spot - crossing causes a bump in the light curve .",
    "the observed anomaly in the bottom panel of figure [ moon ] is inconsistent with a single bump , so the spot is unlikely to cause the anomaly .",
    "gravity darkening makes the light curve asymmetric ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in section 5.3 ,",
    "we identify the target star as the slow - rotating star , and the gravity darkening is negligible . in conclusion , these mechanisms are unlikely to explain the ring - like signal in the light curve .",
    "the ring - like structure in the light curve shows up only for a short duration .",
    "thus , the short - term stellar noise might mimic the ring - like anomaly just by chance . to discuss this possibility",
    ", we investigate the statistical property of the stellar activity of kic 10403228 .",
    "specifically , we consider how frequently one encounters stellar noises comparable to the anomalous in - transit residuals .",
    "as will be shown , we find it difficult to reproduce the feature with stellar activities of kic 10403228 . in principle",
    "we could check to see if the similar feature arises in stars other than kic 10403228 more generally , but it is a separate question and does not answer if the signal for the particular star is due to that stellar activity .",
    "therefore we analyze the light curve of kic 10403228 alone in this section .    to focus on the short - term noises , we remove the long - term variations by dividing the light curves into short segments and fitting each of them with polynomials .",
    "the more specific procedure is as follows .",
    "we exclude in - transit data as well as data around gaps in the light curve . from the remaining data",
    ", we pick up a segment of @xmath192-day long light curve centered around a randomly chosen time and fit it with a quartic polynomial to remove the variation within the segment . in principle , one could use different functions ( e.g. a spline function ) or different time - window for detrending , but in any case the final results are insensitive to these choices . for consistency , we adopt the same baseline and time - window as those used in section 6.1 .",
    "we iterate  picking up a segment \" and  detrending \" procedures 1000 times and obtain 1000 segments of detrended light curves , whose centers are randomly distributed over the whole observing duration .",
    "we note that the total number of points in the detrended segments is @xmath193 , which is sufficiently large to sample all the original data points ( @xmath194 ) . by averaging the 1000 detrended light curves at each time",
    ", we obtain one light curve . this averaging operation suppresses the dependence on the choice of the central time of each segment .",
    "figure [ hist_stellar ] shows the resulting detrended light curve ( bottom ) along with the light curve before detrending ( top ) .",
    "now we move on to the comparison of the statistical property of stellar activities and the residuals of fit in figure [ best ] .",

    "then , we compute the duration and amplitude ( average of the deviation from the mean @xmath198 ) for each event . for comparison",

    "in addition , comparing these theoretically expected residual levels with observed ones , we can relate the observed residuals to the parameters of the ringed model , even in the absence of clear anomalies .    to simplify the following arguments",
    ", we mainly use @xmath270 instead of @xmath68 to evaluate the significance of the anomaly ( see also section [ ssec : delta_sim ] for detailed reason ) . practically , conversion from one to the other",
    "is rather simple , as the conversion factor @xmath271 is well determined from the observed data alone ; given a transit light curve , the transit duration @xmath272 and the bin size @xmath273 give the number of data points @xmath274 , and the standard deviation @xmath85 can also be inferred from the out - of - transit flux .    for a given region of parameter space @xmath268",

    "the methods to calculate the other variances , @xmath263 , @xmath267 , and @xmath275 will be presented in the following subections .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us consider the orbital period dependence of @xmath291 in equation ( [ s_n_def ] ) . from kepler s third law , @xmath292 .",
    "for the short - period planets , @xmath293 because the number of folded transits is proportional to @xmath294 .",
    "thus , the number of the data @xmath295 is proportional to @xmath296 .",
    "this means that the detectability of rings ( @xmath68 ) is higher for the shorter - period planets for a given value of @xmath260 .",
    "this explains the strong constraints on the ring parameters obtained by @xcite for hot jupiters .",
    "the residual @xmath261 is obtained by fitting the planet - alone model to the data . if the ring does not exist , the value of @xmath262 in equation ( [ s_n_def ] ) , which is formally equivalent to the chi - squared , is expected to be close to the degree of freedom @xmath297 .",

    "the value of @xmath176 is computed using the data just around the transit ( within @xmath304 from the transit center ) so that the value is not strongly affected by the out - of - transit data .",

    "the initial values of @xmath312 and @xmath19 for fitting are taken from the koi catalog .",
    "the initial values of the limb darkening parameters are taken from the _ kepler _ input catalog .",
    "for a single transit event , where we can not estimate the orbital period from the transit interval , we choose @xmath206 , instead of @xmath313 , as a fitting parameter and estimate @xmath314 from @xmath206 using kepler s third law and the mean stellar density given in the catalog .    in fitting , we remove outliers iteratively to correctly evaluate @xmath80 .",
    "we first fit all the data with the model @xmath307 , and flag the points that deviate more than @xmath315 from the best model .",
    "we then refit only the non - flagged data using the same model , and update the flags of _ all _ the original data points , including the ones classified as outliers before , on the basis of the new best model and the same @xmath315 criterion .",
    "we iterate this procedure until the flagged data are converged .",
    "while this process gives a more robust evaluation of @xmath176 , it may also erase the signature of the ringed planet ; thus we visually check all the light curves in any case not to miss the real ringed planets .",
    "the noise variance @xmath316 is estimated for each transit light curve by fitting the out - of - transit light curve with a fourth - order polynomial , and calculating the variance of the residuals .",
    "flare - like events are excluded from the estimation of the noise variance .",
    "since the parameter space @xmath268 for a ringed planet is very vast , we wish to reduce the volume we need to search with simulations as much as possible .",
    "first we show that @xmath318 does not depend on @xmath206 and @xmath313 with other parameters fixed including limb darkening parameters @xmath319 , the transit impact parameter @xmath19 , planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath320 , inner and outer ring radii relative to the planetary radius @xmath321 and @xmath322 , , the direction of the ring @xmath18 , and a shading parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this property becomes apparent by rewriting @xmath318 into the following integral form approximately , assuming that the sampling rate ( @xmath273 ) is sufficiently small compared to the duration @xmath272 : @xmath323 where @xmath324 and the origin of time is shifted to the transit center .",

    "therefore , @xmath326 given by equation ( [ eq : delta_sim_bar ] ) does not depend on the time scale of the transit @xmath272 , which is determined by @xmath206 and @xmath313 , and we do not need to simulate the dependence of @xmath327 on these two parmeters .    to constrain the parameter space further ,",
    "we use the observed transit depth . here",
    "we also assume that the values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath321 , and the ring direction are fixed and that @xmath320 and @xmath322 are the only free parameters .",
    "then , the constraint on the observed transit depth leaves only one degree of freedom , specified by contours in the @xmath320-@xmath322 plane ; henceforth we rewrite @xmath328 as @xmath329 to explicitly show this dependence .    to compute the relation @xmath329 for a given transit depth",
    ", we first calculate the value of @xmath330 and the transit depths for a sufficient number of points in the @xmath331 plane .",
    "the necessary number of points depends on the fiducial model , and , in our simulation , we prepare about two hundred points for each model in table [ sec3_ring ] . for any @xmath322 ,",
    "the observed transit depth uniquely translates into @xmath332 by the interpolation in the @xmath332-transit depth plane , because the transit depth is a monotonically increasing function of the @xmath332 .",
    "thus , the given value of @xmath322 is uniquely related to @xmath333 given the transit depth . by repeating this procedure for many different values of @xmath322 , we can compute the relation @xmath329 .",
    "we note that once a sufficient number of interpolated lines are prepared , one transit depth determines the relation @xmath329 without additional calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : flux ] shows @xmath329 curves created in this way , for @xmath334 different sets of impact parameters , ring directions , and transit depths .",

    "this is because the value of @xmath329 shows no @xmath320 dependence beyond @xmath338 , when @xmath335 and @xmath336 are adopted ; if this is the case , the planetary disk is within the outer disk and the transit depth is solely determined by the latter .    in this paper",
    ", we only use the observed constraint on the transit depth . however , this is just for simplicity and we can certainly take into account the constraints on other parameters including @xmath19 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 from the morphology of the observed transit light curve ( e.g. egress and ingress durations ) .",
    "such constraints further restrict the ring models that could be consistent with the observed light curve and thus help more elaborate discussions on the ring parameters , which we leave to future works .",
    "if a system is classified into group ( b ) , the ring models with @xmath339 are excluded .",
    "the upper limits of @xmath322 thus obtained are summarized in sections 4 and 5 . here",
    "we describe how the limit is derived using the relation @xmath340 , taking koi-1466.01 for example .",
    "the black and red lines in figure [ can_1466 ] are theoretically expected signals from the ringed planets ( i.e. , @xmath340 ) for model i @xmath71 model iv and for the transit depth of 0.0202 inferred from the observed data .",
    "the green line shows the threshold value of @xmath341 that satisfies @xmath342 , and the blue line shows the observed residual level @xmath343 obtained by fitting the planet - alone model to the data .",
    "here @xmath344 , which means that no significant deviation from the planet - alone model is detected . in this case",

    ", the ring with @xmath345 would have produced the anomaly with @xmath346 , which is not detected in reality .",
    "thus , we can set the upper limit of @xmath347 for model i. note that the upper limits depend on the adopted parameter set ; this situation is clearly illustrated in figure [ can_1466 ] , where similar limits can not be derived for the other models ."
