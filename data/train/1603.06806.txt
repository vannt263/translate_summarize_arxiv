    "the exponential family is one of the most important and widely used parametric families of probability distributions in statistical applications .",
    "for instance , as exponential variables describe the lengths between consecutive occurrences of a homogeneous poisson process , they are frequently used to model many physical phenomena .",
    "the mathematical simplicity of the exponential distribution usually allows to obtain explicit formulas and closed - form expressions ( in terms of elementary functions ) in those problems in which exponential variables are involved . therefore ,",
    "as it was already pointed out in @xcite , exponential models are frequently considered as a first - step approximation to other more complex models that could be more appropriate for a particular situation .",
    "for this reason , exponential distributions are often overused in applications . statistical tools to evaluate the error made in the approximation of a random variable by an exponential one are therefore worthwhile .",
    "the exponential distribution also exhibits an uncountable number of significant mathematical properties ( see the monographs by @xcite and @xcite ) and many important characterizations ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the class of exponential variables also plays a prominent role in reliability and life testing analysis ( see @xcite , or , more recently , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the exponential family is , undoubtedly , the most important one - parameter family of life distributions .",
    "further , the most frequently used families of life distributions can be viewed as multi - parameter extensions of the exponential distribution .    among the multiple characterizations of exponentiality",
    ", we highlight its lack of memory and constant hazard rate . due to these two properties ,",
    "the main classes of ageing distributions in reliability theory are usually defined by comparing some characteristic of a random variable with the corresponding one of an exponential variable of the same expectation .",
    "other classes lifetime distributions are characterized by establishing an appropriate stochastic ordering relationship with respect to the exponential variable ( of equal mean ) .    in this work",
    ", we follow a completely different approach . instead of comparing a specific property of a random variable with the corresponding one of an exponential distribution , we aim to compute the distance of the random variable to the class of exponential ones . to be more precise , from now on we denote by @xmath4 the random variable with exponential distribution with mean @xmath5 and by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , its ( cumulative ) distribution function .",
    "define @xmath8 as the _ exponential class _ given by @xmath9 for a positive random variable @xmath0 and an appropriate probability metric @xmath10 , we are interested in estimating the distance @xmath11 we only consider _ primary distances _ , that is , metrics between probability measures .",
    "hence , @xmath12 is completely determined by the pair of marginal distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath13 . for notational convenience , if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the distribution functions of @xmath0 and @xmath13 , respectively , we indistinctly use @xmath16 or @xmath12 and @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to _ simple metrics _ , i.e. , metrics such that @xmath19 is equivalent to @xmath20 .    for some of the metrics considered in this paper",
    ", it can be checked that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the expectation of @xmath0 .",
    "however , in some other examples , it is not easy to determine the minimal element in @xmath8 for which the infimum in ( [ distance to exponential ] ) is attained . in such cases , we simply propose to estimate @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , although in general @xmath24 , we consider @xmath25 as the natural representant in @xmath8 to measure the distance of @xmath0 to the exponential class .",
    "information on @xmath23 can be used to assert whether the exponential model provides a reasonable approximation of @xmath0 .",
    "we also observe that , even within the same class of ( ageing ) distributions , two ( lifetime ) variables may have a very different behavior because they can be far away one from the other .",
    "therefore , it may be interesting to quantify the distance to the exponential class to have a better understanding of the underlying properties of the corresponding random variables .",
    "the distance @xmath23 , where @xmath0 runs in a set of random variables @xmath26 , can also be used as a _ clustering variable _ , that is , a variable that detects groups or similitudes among the variables in @xmath26 . in this framework",
    ", we might further define collections of ( integrable ) distributions in terms of the proximity to the exponential class . for @xmath27",
    ", we define the _ @xmath28-neighbourhood of @xmath8 _ as @xmath29 we observe that @xmath30 ( the exponential class ) and , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 can be viewed as the class of exponential random variables for which we allow a degree of contamination @xmath33 , measured by the distance @xmath10 . in other words , @xmath32 is a full topological neighborhood of the exponential class .",
    "this definition follows the spirit of robustness by @xcite , where breakdown points are defined in terms of metrics , such as the lvy , kolmogorov and prohorov metrics .",
    "actually , in general @xmath32 contains neighborhoods of exponential variables constituted by epsilon - contaminated exponential mixtures ( see section [ subsection contamination ] ) .    in practice , the distribution of the random variable @xmath0 is usually unknown .",
    "therefore , the distance @xmath23 has to be estimated based a random sample @xmath34 from @xmath0 .",
    "we propose to use the plug - in estimator obtained by replacing the true distribution @xmath14 of @xmath0 by the empirical distribution @xmath35 of the sample @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath36 where @xmath37 stands for the indicator function of the set @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath39 as the natural estimator of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sample mean .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath39 .",
    "as it follows from general results in @xcite , under appropriate assumptions , it can be shown that @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , we want to determine the asymptotic distribution of @xmath43 a related problem was considered by @xcite , who obtained strong consistency and rates of convergence for a plug - in estimator of integral probability metrics between two probability measures .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the zolotarev ideal metrics , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , that we will discuss throughout this work .",
    "these metrics are suitable for the problem under consideration as @xmath46 measures the maximum error made in the approximation of @xmath0 by @xmath25 in expected value within a certain class of smooth functions .",
    "moreover , the metrics @xmath44 are more sensitive to extreme values than the usual kolmogorov metric . among zolotarev metrics",
    ", we check that the only posible choices are the so - called wasserstein distance and the zolotarev @xmath47-metric .",
    "the wasserstein metric has found applications in many areas ( see section [ subsection wasserstein ] ) , whereas , as mentioned in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 15 ) , the zolotarev @xmath47-metric is appropriate for investigating some ageing properties of lifetime distributions .",
    "we also enumerate some properties of these two distances , recall their dual representations , and provide explicit expressions for @xmath48 . as these two metrics are not scale invariant",
    ", we propose to use normalized versions of the distances to obtain dimensionless quantities .",
    "for these distances , the relationship between @xmath32 and the usual @xmath33-contamination ( by mixtures ) neighborhoods of exponential variables is also briefly discussed . in section [ section asymptotic ]",
    ", we determine the asymptotic distribution of @xmath48 , for the wasserstein distance , the zolotarev @xmath47-metric , and their normalized counterparts .",
    "we also obtain sharp asymptotic results on the convergence of the underlying stochastic process in the space @xmath49 ( endowed with the usual norm @xmath50 ) , which can be of independent theoretical interest in other problems related to the exponential distribution . in section [ section simulation ] , a simulation study is carried out to assess the practical performance of our proposal with finite samples .",
    "a real data set is analyzed in section [ section real data ] .",
    "finally , detailed proofs of the main results are included in the technical appendix .",
    "as stated in section  [ section.introduction ] we want to measure how far the probability distribution of a positive random variable @xmath0 of interest is from the exponential class @xmath8 .",
    "a central issue is , thus , to choose a suitable metric quantifying such a distance . throughout this section , @xmath0 and @xmath13",
    "denote two general positive random variables with cumulative distribution functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "when we assume that @xmath13 follows an exponential distribution with mean @xmath51 , then we specifically denote it by @xmath25 and its distribution function by @xmath52 .    in this work",
    ", we consider the _ zolotarev metric _ of order @xmath1 , @xmath45 , ( see @xcite ) , defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the class of @xmath55-times continuously differentiable functions @xmath56 satisfying the lipschitz condition @xmath57 , for all @xmath58 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath59 .",
    "the class @xmath54 can also be substituted by the set of functions @xmath60 having @xmath1-th derivative @xmath61 a.e . and such that @xmath62 a.e . for a general reference and properties of the distance",
    "@xmath44 we refer to @xcite .",

    "@xmath66 , for all @xmath67 .",
    "the metric @xmath44 is important because it metrizes weak convergence plus convergence of @xmath1-th absolute moments .",
    "for this reason , and because @xmath44 is ideal , these metrics appear naturally when studying problems related to limit theorems in probability theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the case @xmath68 has special interest , as @xmath69 coincides with the so - called wasserstein distance .",

    "* section 15 ) to check the robustness of a @xmath70-test of exponentiality .",
    "the metric @xmath71 has been applied in the context of distributional recurrences in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further , several bounds involving zolotarev metrics can be given for other probability metrics such as kolmogorov and lvy metrics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "definition ( [ zolotarev - metrics ] ) shows that @xmath46 represents the maximum error in the expected value within the class of functions @xmath54 due to the approximation of @xmath0 by @xmath25 . in particular , for every function @xmath60 with @xmath1-th derivative",
    ", we have that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the sup - norm .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath74 guarantees the equality of all moments of @xmath0 and @xmath13 up to order @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath75 , for @xmath76 ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , then @xmath74 is also finite .",
    "in particular , we see that if @xmath0 is a positive random variable with mean @xmath79 , then @xmath80 however , in general , when @xmath81 and @xmath0 is _ not _ exponential , we have that @xmath82 .",
    "this follows from the fact that , for many distributions , equalities @xmath83 and @xmath84 are too restrictive and they actually imply that @xmath0 is exponential .",
    "for instance , this happens for the classes hnbue or hnwue variables ( see section [ subsection zolotarev ] for more details on these classes of ageing distributions ) , as it can be checked by known results on stochastic equality under convex domination ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.a.42 , p. 133 ) ) .",
    "therefore , only the cases @xmath68 and @xmath85 make sense for the discussed problem .",
    "the case @xmath68 in ( [ zolotarev - metrics ] ) has special relevance . by the kantorovich ",
