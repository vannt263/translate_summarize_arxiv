    "in the present section , we shall document for the first time , how to install and use the tauola universal interface with ` any ' production generator , to include spin effects in e.g. the @xmath17 process @xcite .",

    "it is interfaced with the jetset generator ; however , it works in the same manner with pythia , herwig and should work with the isajet generator as well .",
    "in fact , such an interface can be considered as a separate software project , to some degree independent from both the specific problem of @xmath0 production and its decay .",
    "the aim of this interface is not to replace the matrix element calculations , but rather to provide a method of calculating / estimating spin effects in cases when these would not be taken into account at all .",
    "the question of adapting the universal interface to different versions of an hepevt event record goes beyond the technicalities discussed in section [ opphotos ] .",
    "in fact it is quite involved , as it depends on specific needs due to the way the hepevt event record is actually coded into the hepevt common block .",
    "it varies from application to application according to the physics requirement . during the mc4lhc workshop  @xcite",
    "these issues were discussed and it was found , thanks to interaction with the users , that the tauola universal interface works with all 3 basic options for hepevt filled by pythia 6.2 ( mstp(128)=0,1,2 ) , as well as with herwig ( 6.150 ) @xcite . in our example",
    "we keep only the working interface with pythia version 5.7 , the working example with other installations can be found e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of the related problems go beyond this document ; we refer the reader to section [ sekcja8 ] for more details .",
    "we are also convinced that the problems , because they originate from physics , will appear in event records in other programming languages such as c++ .",
    "let us start with the simpler case , when only longitudinal spin degrees are included .",
    "then the interface acts in the following way :    * the user has to verify if the @xmath0 lepton is forced to be stable in the package performing generation of the @xmath0 production . * the contents of the hepevt common block is searched for all @xmath0 leptons and @xmath0 neutrinos . *",
    "it is checked if there are @xmath0 flavour pairs ( two @xmath0 leptons or a @xmath0 lepton and a @xmath0 neutrino ) originating from the same mother(s ) . *",
    "the decays of the @xmath0 flavour pairs are performed with the subroutine tauola .",
    "longitudinal spin correlations are generated in the case of the @xmath0 produced from the decay of : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the charged higgs boson @xmath23 ( for the neutral higgs boson the full spin correlations are used , see section  [ transv ] ) .",
    "parallel or antiparallel spin configurations are generated , before calling on the @xmath0 decay , and then the decays of 100% polarized @xmath0 s are executed . * in the case of the higgs boson ( for the spin correlations to be generated ) the identifier of the @xmath0 mother must be that of the higgs boson .",
    "the particle code convention as that used by the pythia 5.7@xcite monte carlo is adopted , but it can be changed by the user , as explained later in this section . * in the case of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 , this is not necessary , because the interface assumes these production mechanisms as defaults , even if the @xmath24 or @xmath25 bosons are not explicitly present in the event record .",
    "for example if from the same mother as that of the @xmath0 , a @xmath26 is also produced , the @xmath24 ( of the momentum equal to the sum of @xmath0 and @xmath26 ) will be taken as the true mother of the @xmath0 . similarly ,",

    ", @xmath28 produced from explicit or implicit @xmath25 states are upgraded up to nearly koralz standards @xcite .",
    "if bremsstrahlung protons are present in the event record ( as sisters of @xmath29 ) , then they have to be mergerd either with beams or with @xmath0 s , accordingly to approximation explained in @xcite .",
    "photon radiation in the decay is performed with photos package @xcite .",
    "let us note that the calculation of the @xmath0 polarization created from the @xmath29 and/or virtual @xmath30 ( as a function of the direction ) represents a rather non - trivial extension if high precision is required .",
    "generally , the dedicated study of the production matrix elements of the host generator is necessary in every individual case .",

    "we changed the normalization of @xmath100 and @xmath101 by the same factor , so as to reproduce the total 4@xmath1 rate as in pdg 2000 .",
    "note that the interference of the @xmath66 current with the remaining part provides 1.7 % effect on the total rate .    1 mm      1 mm",
    "the changes we introduced are collected in the following subsections .",
    "1 mm      1 mm during the test phase of the photos+ @xcite , a c++ implementation of the photos algorithm , it turned out that the generation becomes unstable for events produced at tev energies .",
    "the use of photos at this energy range was then studied for the first time .",
    "the kinematics of events produced by pythia 5.7 was often not precise enough , because of rounding errors for ( real*4 ) floating - point variables .",
    "the particles described by a tree - structured event record ( i.e. hepevt common block used by photos ) , form decay ` branches ' composed of a ` mother '  the decaying particle , and ` daughters '  its decay products .",
    "when the kinematics of a branch is not correct ( the sum of 4-momentum of decay products does not match the 4-momentum of the mother particle or the particles momenta are off shell ) , numerical instabilities are encountered .",
    "it is not possible to perform boosts of the particles correctly if the boost parameters are large ( in certain of the events where errors occurred , we found , for instance , a pion with momentum of order of tev / c ) .",
    "a special routine phcork , which corrects these kinds of inconsistencies , have been developed and inserted to photos code .",
    "the routine works in one of four modes , selected at the initialization of photos :    * mode 1 : no correction performed , * mode 2 : energy is corrected from mass , * mode 3 : mass is corrected from energy , * mode 4 : energy is corrected from mass for particles up to a mass of 0.4  gev , for heavier ones : mass is corrected .    in cases , where a branch ( sub - cascade starting from certain particles ) has two mothers ,",
    "the first mother s momentum is corrected according to the sum of its children momenta and the momentum of the second mother .",
    "the default mode is 1 , which means that no correction is applied , and full compatibility with older implementations is retained .",
    "correction is performed in two steps .",
    "first , all daughters energies ( or masses , depending on the requested mode of correction ) are corrected to fulfil the @xmath102 constraint .    in the second step ,",
    "the sum of all daughters 4-momenta is calculated .",
    "the mother s momentum is corrected to this value . in cases where two mothers are present , only the first mother s 4-momentum",
    "is corrected to a value :    @xmath103 .",
    "1 mm      1 mm in the published version of photos @xcite the interference between photon emission from two sources was available only for two - body decays into particles of opposite charge and equal mass .",
    "since then , the interference correction was extended to work also in the case of decays into particles of distinct masses .",
    "on the technical side the interference correction was re - coded to work more efficiently .",
    "for example this should prevent the program to stop in case of double bremsstrahlung and interference corrections in the decay of the very heavy @xmath104 state .    1 mm      1 mm    for some users , it is convenient to block / enable photos generation in some cases , for tests or because of unphysical coding of events into the hepevt common block",
    ". flags to block / enable photos generation in @xmath105 and in @xmath24 decay into quarks were introduced .",
    "the flags are initialized in the subroutine phoini .",
    "1 mm      1 mm    for the leptonic decays of the @xmath24 boson , photos predictions were carefully compared with the results from the first order matrix element generator @xcite .",
    "it was found that even though the leading corrections were properly modelled by photos , the non - leading missing effects were relatively large .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies was understood , and the appropriate correcting weight was introduced into photos . with these changes",
    "the agreement with the matrix element calculation improved sizeably @xcite , especially in regions of phase space populated with hard non - collinear photons .",
    "a new option was introduced , to initialize this correcting weight .",
    "it can be switched on / off with the new flag ifw , initialized in subroutine phocin .",
    "the method can easily be extended to other processes where the matrix element is available from qed calculations or from modelling based on experimental data .",
    "1 mm      1 mm    once all these modifications are installed , the new version 2.07 of photos was created .",
    "let us note that the packages presented here work with the standard hepevt event record , where the tree structure of the event evolution is properly coded into a unique tree structure .",
    "generally this is not the case .",
    "however , the programs were shown to work properly with the extension of the standard of the type as originating from pythia @xcite with mstp(128)=0,1,2 .",
    "necessary adjustments turned out to be non - trivial and in fact correctness of their action can not be garanteed in the general case @xcite .",
    "the case of herwig @xcite turned out to be even more complex . even though in this case the hepevt common block is used as standard event record , the mother ",
    "daugter pointers are nonetheless used in a different way . as a consequence ,",
    "events generated by herwig are far from the design format of the hepevt event record .",
    "we were able to tune the working of the tauola universal interface to the requirements of operating with herwig ; however , the interfacing of photos turned out to be rather more difficult .",
    "the principal issue from which difficulties with the hepevt decoding arise is that pythia as well as herwig produce a new copy of the participating particles each time a physical effect ( e.g. final state radiation ) is added ; consequently several copies of particle entries are produced , which can not be consistently put in the hepevt structure . in order to circumvent this problem ,",
    "the jmohep and/or jdahep entries are _ overloaded _ , i.e. the information stored in them is used for other purposes than their original one .",
    "for example , pythia with mstp(128)=0 setting uses the jmohep entry to point to the copies of a particle ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : hepevt_py ] ) and herwig uses the jmohep(2,i ) entries to store the colour information of the particle flow .",
    "a generic interface thus has to be informed of these possibilities and to correct for them for the tauola and photos procedures to work properly .    at present",
    "a working version of modified photos routines , which appears to work with herwig , can be found in the distribution of acermc @xcite .",
    "however rigorous testing is necessary before these modifications can be included in the official photos distribution .",
    "the original photos code had to be modified due to the ` overloaded ' hepevt record , since its requirements for matching mother ",
    "daughter pointers were too strict for either pythia or herwig .",
    "the modification was limited to photos_make and phobos routines .",
    "in addition the tracking of the idhw array was added to photos_make to accommodate the herwig event record .",
    "a further modification was however necessary in the phoin routine since in herwig the entry jmohep(2,i ) is not empty but filled with colour flow information , which in turn inhibited photos radiation off participating particles process , which is treated by a set of dedicated routines ; this in turn clashes with herwig overloaded jmohep(2,i ) entry . ]",
    "it has to be stressed that implementing the herwig interface to photos is desirable since up to version 6.5 herwig did not have any qed radiation implemented in the decays . in the later releases ,",
    "photos is installed in decays ( and hadronic production ) of @xmath107-quarks , as well as in @xmath24 decays .",
    "this is done , however , through specifically tailored interfaces embodied within the herwig code .",
    "another two issues are related to the double counting .",
    "if there is no information passed from the host program and the common block phoqed of photos is not appropriately filled , then there is no way for photos to know that in some decays it should not generate bremsstrahlung ( again ) and thus ` double counting ' will appear .",
    "while the question is not relevant for herwig , since no photon bremsstrahlung is implemented , it can become an issue in pythia , for some specific processes .",
    "indeed , one can generally switch off the photon radiation off leptons ( by setting a high limit on parj(90 ) , cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , one can not do it on the basis of specific processes and/or decays .",
    "the issue is not shared in the tauola universal interface , since the decayed @xmath0 leptons are not decayed again and the original decay will remain .",
    "we have presented the system for creating the required version of photos and tauola packages from their master versions .",
    "the master versions are structured in a relatively compact form without code duplications etc .",
    "the minor modifications of the programs , introduced since their publication , were also explained .",
    "the creation of the system was the first step towards future attempts to develop packages without loss of their present physics contents .",
    "some experience , already collected in that direction , is summarized in @xcite .",
    "we find the question of the language translation for the fixed program version relatively easy . on the contrary",
    ", the question of project continuity into further upgrades motivated by the physics needs to be thought over carefully .",
    "matching the programming styles of the c++ experts with the strategies of testing numerical correctness of consecutive versions is a rather crucial issue , which has to be addressed .",
    "tools and methods embodied in fortran code survive such translation with difficulty .    at a certain moment , the necessary strategy may thus require fluency in the fortran , object - orientated languages and physics content of the project by the same person .",
    "platform - independent tools for mixing code in fortran and oo languages might be of great help .    in this paper",
    "we have also documented for the first time technical side of the universal interface for the tauola package . from now on ,",
    "its version number 1.10 is printed in the output .",
    "authors are grateful to aleph , cleo , delphi and opal collaborations for providing their appropriate versions of the whole or parts of tauola initialization . useful discussions and suggestions from b. bloch , c. biscarat , s. jadach , j. h. khn , m. peskin , s. slabospitzky and a. weinstein",
