    "solitons play an important role in many areas of physics . as classical solutions of non - linear field theories , they are localised structures with finite energy , which are globally regular . in general , one can distinguish topological and non - topological solitons . while topological solitons @xcite possess a conserved quantity , the topological charge , that stems ( in most cases ) from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory , non - topological solitons @xcite have a conserved noether charge that results from a symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "the standard example of non - topological solitons are @xmath0-balls @xcite , which are solutions of theories with self - interacting complex scalar fields .",
    "these objects are stationary with an explicitely time - dependent phase .",
    "the conserved noether charge @xmath0 is then related to the global phase invariance of the theory and is a function of the frequency .",
    "@xmath0 can e.g. be interpreted as particle number @xcite .",
    "while in standard scalar field theories , it was shown that a non - renormalisable @xmath4-potential is necessary @xcite , supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) also possess @xmath0-ball solutions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "several scalar fields interact via complicated potentials .",
    "it was shown that cubic interaction terms that result from yukawa couplings in the superpotential and supersymmetry breaking terms lead to the existence of @xmath0-balls with non - vanishing baryon or lepton number or electric charge .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been considered recently as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "these objects have been constructed numerically using the exact form of the supersymmetric potential .",
    "@xmath0-ball solutions in @xmath1 dimensions have been studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "it was realised that next to non - spinning @xmath0-balls , which are spherically symmetric , spinning solutions exist .",
    "these are axially symmetric with energy density of toroidal shape and angular momentum @xmath5 , where @xmath0 is the noether charge of the solution and @xmath6 corresponds to the winding around the @xmath7-axis . approximated solutions of the non - linear partial differential equations were constructed in @xcite by means of a truncated series in the spherical harmonics to describe the angular part of the solutions .",
    "the full partial differential equation was solved numerically in @xcite ( for a short review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was also realised in @xcite that in each @xmath8-sector , parity - even ( @xmath9 ) and parity - odd ( @xmath10 ) solutions exist .",
    "parity - even and parity - odd refers to the fact that the solution is symmetric and anti - symmetric , respectively with respect to a reflection through the @xmath11-@xmath12-plane , i.e. under @xmath13 .",
    "these two types of solutions are closely related to the fact that the angular part of the solutions constructed in @xcite is connected to the spherical harmonic @xmath14 for the spherically symmetric @xmath0-ball , to the spherical harmonic @xmath15 for the spinning parity even ( @xmath9 ) solution and to the spherical harmonic @xmath16 for the parity odd ( @xmath10 ) solution , respectively .",
    "radially excited solutions of the spherically symmetric , non - spinning solution were also obtained .",
    "these solutions are still spherically symmetric but the scalar field develops one or several nodes for @xmath170,\\infty[$ ] . in relation to the apparent connection of the angular part of the known solutions to the spherical harmonics , `` @xmath18-angular excitations '' of the @xmath0-balls corresponding to the spherical harmonics @xmath19 , @xmath20 have been constructed explicitely for some values of @xmath8 and @xmath21 in @xcite .",
    "these excited solutions could play a role in the formation of @xmath0-balls in the early universe since it is believed that @xmath0-balls forming due to condensate fragmentation at the end of inflation first appear in an excited state and only then settle down to the ground state @xcite .",
    "the fact that these newly formed @xmath0-balls are excited , i.e. in general not spherically symmetric could , on the other hand , be a source of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the interaction of two @xmath0-balls has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the lower bound on the frequencies @xmath22 , @xmath23 is increasing for increasing interaction coupling .",
    "explicit examples of a rotating @xmath0-ball interacting with a non - rotating @xmath0-ball have been presented .",
    "complex scalar field models coupled to gravity exhibit a new type of solution , so - called `` boson stars '' @xcite . in @xcite boson stars",
    "have been considered that have flat space - time limits in the form of @xmath0-balls .    in this paper , we study interacting boson stars with flat limit solutions in the form of the interacting @xmath0-balls that have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the boson stars are interacting via a potential term , but of course also through gravity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we give the model , ansatz and boundary conditions . in section 3 and 4 , we discuss our results for @xmath0-balls and their gravitating counterparts , boson stars , respectively .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we study a scalar field model coupled minimally to gravity in @xmath1 dimensions describing two interacting boson stars . the action @xmath24 reads : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ricci scalar , @xmath27 denotes newton s constant and @xmath28 denotes the matter lagrangian : @xmath29 where both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are complex scalar fields and we choose as signature of the metric @xmath32 .",
    "the potential reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath23 are the standard potential parameters for each boson star , while @xmath37 denotes the interaction parameter .",
    "the masses of the two bosonic scalar fields are then given by @xmath38 , @xmath23 .",
    "along with @xcite , we choose in the following @xmath39    in @xcite it was argued that a @xmath4-potential is necessary in order to have classical @xmath0-ball solutions .",
    "this is still necessary for the model we have defined here , since we want @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be a local minimum of the potential .",
    "a pure @xmath42-potential which is bounded from below would nt fulfill these criteria .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath28 ( [ lag ] ) is invariant under the two independent global u(1 ) transformations @xmath43 as such the total conserved noether current @xmath44 , @xmath45 , associated to these symmetries is just the sum of the two individually conserved currents @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the total noether charge @xmath52 of the system is then the sum of the two individual noether charges @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55    finally , the energy - momentum tensor reads : @xmath56      for the metric the ansatz in lewis - papapetrou form reads @xcite : @xmath57 where the metric function @xmath58 , @xmath21 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are functions of @xmath61 and @xmath18 only . for the scalar fields ,",
    "the ansatz reads : @xmath62 where the @xmath22 and the @xmath63 are constants .",
    "since we require @xmath64 , @xmath23 , we have @xmath65 .",
    "the mass @xmath66 and total angular momentum @xmath67 of the solution can be read off from the asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions @xcite : @xmath68 the total angular momentum @xmath69 and the noether charges @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the two boson stars are related by @xmath70 .",
    "boson stars with @xmath71 have thus vanishing angular momentum .",
    "equally , interacting boson stars with @xmath72 and @xmath73 have vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the coupled system of partial differential equations is then given by the einstein equations @xmath74 with @xmath75 given by ( [ em ] ) and the klein - gordon equations @xmath76 details about these equations for one complex scalar field can e.g. be found in @xcite .",
    "we require the solutions to be regular at the origin .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions read : @xmath77 for solutions with @xmath78 , while for @xmath71 solutions , we have @xmath79 the boundary conditions at infinity result from the requirement of asymptotic flatness and finite energy solutions : @xmath80    for @xmath81 the regularity of the solutions on the @xmath7-axis requires : @xmath82 for @xmath78 solutions , while for @xmath71 solutions , we have @xmath83    the conditions at @xmath84 are either given by @xmath85 for even parity solutions , while for odd parity solutions the conditions for the scalar field functions read : @xmath86 , @xmath23 .      in the following , we will solve the system of partial differential equations ( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) subject to the appropriate boundary conditions given in section 2.2 .",
    "this has been done using the pde solver fidisol @xcite .",
    "we have mapped the infinite interval of the @xmath61 coordinate @xmath87 $ ] to the finite compact interval @xmath88 $ ] using the new coordinate @xmath89 .",
    "we have typically used grid sizes of @xmath90 points in @xmath61-direction and @xmath91 points in @xmath18 direction .",
    "the solutions pesented here have relative errors of @xmath92 or smaller .",
    "in this section , we study solutions in a flat space - time background , i.e. we choose @xmath93 . the @xmath0-balls",
    "then interact only via the potential for @xmath94 .      in order to be able to understand the structure of a system of two interacting @xmath0-balls and their gravitating counterparts",
    ", we briefly reconsider the one @xmath0-ball system .",
    "this has been studied in great detail in @xcite and arises from our model for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in this section",

    "explicit examples of the angular excited solutions have been presented for specific values of @xmath8 and @xmath21 . in the following",
    ", these solutions will be labelled by the two quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath21 , i.e. if we use @xmath103 , we refer to the solution of the full equation which corresponds to the spherical harmonic @xmath101 .    as already stated in section 2.2 ,",
    "the boundary conditions depend on @xmath21 , @xmath8 . here , we want to state the boundary conditions explicitely together with the parity @xmath104 of the solution under @xmath105 for the first few values of @xmath8 and @xmath21 ( see table 1 ) .",
    ".boundary conditions and parity @xmath104 for different choices of @xmath21 and @xmath8 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us stress that all these conditions are compatible with the trivial solution @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the numerical construction of non - vanishing solutions turns out to be a non trivial task .",
    "solutions for the choices of @xmath21 and @xmath8 given in table 1 have been presented in @xcite .",
    "interacting @xmath0-balls were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the interaction is characterized by the coupling constant @xmath37 .",
    "the two @xmath0-balls decouple in the limit @xmath107 . here",
    ", we want to present the energy density of some of the solutions in order to illustrate the influence of the interaction term .",
    "= 11.0 cm +    = 13.0 cm +    = 13.0 cm +    in fig.[fig_mix_00_11 ] we present the energy density for a spherically symmetric , non - rotating @xmath0-ball interacting with an axially symmetric , rotating and parity even @xmath0-ball for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "again , we have chosen @xmath118 and @xmath109 for this case .",
    "the energy density has local maxima at three different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the energy density thus consists of two tori at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , but that we can continue it to @xmath121 due to its symmetry . ] and a deformed spherical ball at @xmath112 .",
    "once gravity is included ( @xmath122 ) , the different possible @xmath0-ball solutions discussed in the previous section become deformed by gravity and are called boson stars . since only @xmath123 appears in the equation for the @xmath0-ball the sign of @xmath8 does not matter and we can restrict ourselves to @xmath124 without loosing generality in the flat space - time background case .",
    "this changes if we consider solutions in curved space - time , i.e. for @xmath125 .",
    "the reason is that the energy - momentum tensor involves terms that are linear in @xmath8 .",
    "reversing the sign of @xmath8 the solutions will have the same energy , but opposite angular momentum .    in the case of interacting boson stars ,",
    "the situation is more involved : when two boson stars with @xmath126 and @xmath127 of the same sign interact the angular momentum is non - vanishing .",
    "however , for @xmath72 the function @xmath128 and the total angular momentum is vanishing .    in the presence of gravity ,",

    "_ j^2 + ( - ) k_j^2 _ j^2 the important point about this expression is that the term containing the `` rotation function '' @xmath129 leads to a negative contribution to the energy density . hence , rotation tends to decrease the energy of the solution .      in the following",
    ", we will abbreviate @xmath130 and focus on the case @xmath131 .",
    "we have fixed the parameters of the potential according to ( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "this case describes two interacting non - rotating boson stars .",
    "the solutions are spherically symmetric . in particular , we find @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the bound state of two spherically symmetric boson stars with a given value of @xmath135 behaves roughly as a single boson star with @xmath136 .",
    "the mass @xmath66 and the values @xmath137 , @xmath23 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 slowly decrease when the parameter @xmath135 increases .",
    "we found no evidence of a limiting behaviour , i.e. no critical @xmath135 beyond which the solutions cease to exist .",
    "= 13.0 cm +    = 13.0 cm +      this corresponds to the interaction of a non - rotating boson star and a rotating , axially symmetric and parity even solution .    the contour plot of a typical solution of this type is presented in fig .",
    "[ contour_00_11 ] for @xmath142 , @xmath95 and @xmath109 .",
    "clearly , the metric functions show non - trivial behaviour now .    varying the gravitational constant @xmath135 ( with all other parameters fixed ) ,",
    "our numerical results show that the scalar field function @xmath143 of the spherically symmetric boson star tends uniformly to zero and that only the spinning boson star survives for sufficiently large @xmath135 .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that rotation , i.e. non - vanishing @xmath129 tends to decrease the energy ( see ( [ ed ] ) ) .",
    "the rotating boson star is therefore energetically favoured in comparison to the non - rotating case .",
    "this phenomenon is however strongly related to the gravitational interaction of the two boson stars .",

    "@xmath144 and with this the field @xmath145 corresponding to the non - rotating boson star becomes identically zero for @xmath146 while the single boson star ( dashed lines ) exists for much larger values of @xmath135 . to illustrate this phenomenon",

    "this is clearly seen when comparing the @xmath147 plot with that for @xmath150 . here",
    ", the value of @xmath148 at the origin has decreased strongly and the energy density tends to the shape of a torus signalling that the spherically symmetric contribution nearly vanishes .",
    "we observe the qualitatively same effect for @xmath94 .",
    "the critical value of the gravitational coupling @xmath151 where @xmath143 becomes identically zero depends slightly on the coupling constant @xmath37 .",
    "we find e.g. @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "since the appearance of ergoregions for globally regular solutions signals the existence of instabilities @xcite we have studies these here as well .",
    "the ergoregions of single boson stars have been studied extensively in @xcite .",
    "ergoregions exist if the @xmath155 component of the metric becomes positive , i.e. for @xmath156    we have studied the appearance of ergoregions for @xmath147 , @xmath157 and two different values of @xmath37 , namely @xmath95 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[omega_00_11 ] . very similar to the case for fixed @xmath157 and varying @xmath135 , the spherically symmetric , non - rotating boson star disappears from the solution for @xmath159 .",
    "we demonstrate this by plotting @xmath144 ( @xmath145 has its maximal value at @xmath160 ) as function of @xmath161 .",
    "we find that @xmath162 decreases with increasing @xmath37 , e.g. we find that @xmath163 for @xmath95 and @xmath164 for @xmath158 .",
    "this is easy to understand , since an increasing @xmath37 means an increasing direct interaction between the two boson stars .",
    "we also plot the maximal value of @xmath155 , @xmath165 as function of @xmath161 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath95 @xmath165 stays negative as long as the spherically symmetric boson star is present .",
    "thus for @xmath147 and @xmath95 , there are no instabilities due to ergoregions for those values of @xmath157 where genuine interacting boson stars exist . for smaller values of @xmath157 ( and the second branch of solutions ) , the curve for @xmath165 would follow the curve for a single rotating boson star given in @xcite .",

    "we find @xmath168 for @xmath169 and @xmath158 .",
    "thus for @xmath170 the two interacting boson stars possess an ergoregion signalling an instability .",
    "it appears that the stronger direct interaction between the boson stars tends to destabilize the system . a more detailed investigation and plots of the ergoregions",
    "will be presented in a future publication .",

    "the same holds true if the gravitational coupling is fixed and the angular frequency lowered . then below a critical value of the angular frequency @xmath179 the non - rotating boson stars has disappeared from the bound system . as a consequence the bound state of two boson stars with @xmath180 and @xmath181 exists only on a finite domain of the parameter space @xmath161 , @xmath182 .",

    "<S> @xmath0-balls and boson stars carry a non - vanishing noether charge and arise as solutions of complex scalar field models in a flat space - time background and coupled minimally to gravity , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we present examples of interacting @xmath0-balls that arise due to angular excitations , which are closely related to the spherical harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> we also construct explicit examples of rotating boson stars that interact with non - rotating boson stars . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that rotating boson stars tend to absorb the non - rotating ones for increasing , but reasonably small gravitational coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is a new phenomenon as compared to the flat space - time limit and is related to the negative contribution of the rotation term to the energy density of the solutions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results indicate that a system of a rotating and non - rotating boson star can become unstable if the direct interaction term in the potential is large enough . </S>",
