    "the study of liquid - liquid phase separation constitutes a unique opportunity of observing the decay modes to equilibrium of a system abruptly brought into a metastable or nonequilibrium state .",

    "the leading quantity is the supersaturation @xmath0 , corresponding to the equilibrium volume fraction of the minority phase . for values of @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 or",
    "equivalently from deep to shallow quenches in the miscibility gap the following stages can be encountered  :    * for critical , i.e. , quasisymmetric , quenches ( @xmath3 ) , the phase - separating mechanism is spinodal decomposition and has been abundantly investigated .",

    "afterwards they coarsen by brownian collision - induced coalescence and the time evolution of their mean size scales as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when they constitute a bicontinuous percolating medium , coarsening continues through surface - tension driven mechanisms ( rayleigh - like instability @xcite , coalescence - induced coalescence @xcite ) which induce a coarsening law linear with time @xcite .",
    "* for off - critical , i.e. , nonsymmetric , quenches , the phase - separating regime is nucleation and growth , where the nucleation has recently been stated as always being heterogeneous .",
    "this statement has been inferred from the monodispersity @xcite and the undercriticality @xcite of the nucleated droplets size .",
    "growth proceeds through the diffusion of one of the components from the supersaturated background to a fixed number of growing nuclei ( free growth ) with a @xmath6 law @xcite . after an intermediate regime where the volume fraction of minority phase reaches its equilibrium value @xmath0 ,",
    "two competing mechanisms are expected .",
    "first when the solute - depleted layers around the growing droplets begin to interact , the coarsening mechanism may become ostwald ripening , i.e. , evaporation - condensation ( undercritical nuclei dissipate into critical ones ) , obeying the @xmath5 lifschitz - slyozov ( ls ) law @xcite .",
    "parallely , as for the spinodal decomposition , when interfaces become sharp , coalescence may proceed through brownian diffusion ( bd ) induced collisions of droplets , which implies also a @xmath5 law , with a different prefactor from ls s one @xcite .",
    "the latter process should prevail at high @xmath0 values and late times .",
    "the volume fraction of minority phase @xmath7 separating these two scenarii has been subject to much discussion but the latest reliable value should be @xmath8@xcite .",
    "few results are available where @xmath0 is systematically scanned between @xmath2 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "hence some points remain questionable among which the precise domain of existence of bd and ls coarsenings and the time of crossover between the free diffusion ( @xmath10 ) and conserved order - parameter ( @xmath5 ) regimes .",
    "whatever the regime , when the droplet size reaches a threshold value , gravity begins to prevail and sedimentation occurs . in the critical regime ,",
    "two contributions to the study of sedimentation have to be mentionned .",
    "the first one identifies the successive stages during the prevailing of gravity @xcite : macroscopic convection , sedimentation of droplets leading to a @xmath11 growth law , appearing of a meniscus sharing the mixture in two macroscopic phases , residual sedimentation .",
    "the second one identifies the growth law during this residual sedimentation stage as @xmath12 , as a consequence of coalescence by both sedimentation and brownian diffusion @xcite . besides",

    "so all curves have been adjusted to our experimental value @xmath22 .",
    "the data of andrew _ et al . _ are quite recent and situated in the mean range of the other results @xcite . accordingly",

    "the diffusion coefficient of the mixture along the acid - rich branch of the coexistence curve is deduced from the above quantities thanks to a stokes - einstein relation : @xmath36 .    to perform the quenches , an optical fused quartz cell containing the mixture is inserted inside a hollow copper block where a thermostat ensures a water circulation , providing a temperature stabilization of the system within 0.01 k. the cell ( optical pathlength 0.1 cm , 1 cm wide and 3 cm high ) is illuminated by a laser beam and is observed by means of a charge - coupled device camera . for each studied concentration",
    ", the temperature of the coexistence curve has been visually determined ( cloud point method ) by a slow decrease of the temperature from the one - phase mixture ( 0.01 k temperature steps , each followed by a 20 minutes stabilization ) .    before each run ,",
    "an energetic stirring is performed followed by a 12 hours annealing in the one - phase region 0.05 k above the coexistence curve .",
    "then , the mixture is rapidly quenched through the binodal line ( @xmath370.03 to 0.53 k below it ) and this incursion in the miscibility gap leads to the phase separation ( cf .",
    "[ photo ] ) . in each case , the volume fraction of acid @xmath19 ( 50 to 55% ) and the reduced temperature @xmath38 ( 2.3 to 6.4@xmath39 with @xmath40 the absolute final temperature ) are chosen in order to induce a volume fraction @xmath0 of the growing phase between 0.3 and 10.5% .",
    "the water - rich phase ( density @xmath41  kg m@xmath42 ) has been chosen as the nucleating and sedimenting phase to prevent wetting effects . indeed the isobutyric acid - rich phase ( density @xmath43  kg m@xmath42 ) is known to preferentially wet the cell walls @xcite .     across the cell as a function of the vertical position @xmath44 and elapsed time @xmath45 for a volume fraction of acid @xmath46 and a quench depth @xmath370.37 k. ]    the evolution of the transmitted intensity along the vertical axis of the cell @xmath47 is extracted from the video output kept in its linear response domain via an image processing software ( cf .",
    "[ photo ] ) an averaging of @xmath47 along an horizontal segment in the middle of the cell is carried out for each value of @xmath44 to gain noise reduction .",
    "then the light attenuation @xmath48 is computed for several times during the phase separation .",
    "@xmath49 stands for the unscattered light intensity refracted by the homogeneous ( droplet - free ) mixture .",
    "this light attenuation is mainly due to scattering .",
    "the refraction indices of the two phases are very similar ( @xmath50 in our @xmath51 range @xcite ) , which is likely to induce a low multiscattering .",
    "so in our @xmath0 range and assuming a small polydispersity , the light attenuation @xmath48 is linked at a first order to the concentration of droplets @xmath52 through the lambert - beer law @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the evolution of the @xmath54 curves with time reports on the change of spatial distribution of droplets during sedimentation as displayed in fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] .    the droplets being larger than the laser wavelength @xmath550.532 @xmath56 m ( see below ) , the attenuation should also be inversely proportional to their squared radius , which could have a slight influence on @xmath57 .",
    "therefore this expression constitutes a qualitative evaluation of @xmath58 but our analysis does not require a more precise determination , dealing only with abrupt slope changes in the behaviour of @xmath58 .",
    "the time origin has been chosen as the cloud appearance time and the space origin as the lower limit of the liquid - air meniscus ( cf .",
    "[ photo ] ) .",
    "right after the quench , the cell becomes uniformly filled with erratically moving droplets forming an opalescent mist ( horizontal upper line in fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] ) . then in the vicinity of the meniscus the droplet concentration progressively decreases down to a zero value owing to an overall vertical motion of the droplets only visible at the top ( clarification zone , droplet - free ) and the bottom ( sedimentation layer , not shown in fig .",
    "[ photo ] and [ attenuation ] ) of the vessel .",
    "afterwards , the initial point @xmath59 of the curves moves down and the value of the plateau sinks .",
    "the first feature reflects a growth of the clarification zone and the second one owes to the decrease of the bulk droplet concentration due to coalescence yielded by brownian and/or gravitational collisions .",
    "in order to highlight the respective role of the brownian and gravitational processes , the knowledge of the pclet number @xmath60 is needed ( @xmath61 mean sedimentation velocity , @xmath62 radius and @xmath63 diffusion coefficient of the droplets ) . indeed this number compares the mean sedimentation velocity @xmath61 to a brownian velocity @xmath64 .    with this purpose , we turn to the clarification zone behavior . its growth can be followed in fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] through the increase with time of the interceipt @xmath59 with time of the light attenuation curve with the abscissa axis . in other words",
    ", @xmath59 corresponds to the upper limit of the sedimentation front . at this point ,",
    "the droplets are very scarce so they can be considered as evolving in a quasi - infinitely dilute regime",
    ". therefore the sedimentation - induced convective part of their motion is insignificant @xcite and their velocity @xmath65 corresponds to the stationary velocity of isolated droplets of radius @xmath66 , given by the hadamard formula @xcite : @xmath67 with @xmath68 the gravitational acceleration , @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively the viscosity of the water - rich drop and of the acid - rich surrounding fluid , @xmath71 and @xmath21 their respective density . to assess the validity of this expression ,",
    "two checkings have been carried out .",
    "this formula is valid provided that inertia effects are negligible .",
    "this requirement is guaranteed by a low reynolds number @xmath72 , always smaller than 2.10@xmath73 in our case .",
    "secondly , even if long - range interdroplet hydrodynamic interactions induced an average settling velocity @xmath74 lower than the hadamard velocity @xmath65 , the hindered settling function @xmath75 would take values between @xmath1 and 1 for @xmath0 ranging from 1 to 10% @xcite .",
    "so these interactions would not yield a noticeable change of the value of the settling velocity .    as @xmath65 is given by the slope of the @xmath76 line ( cf .",
    "[ position ] ) , the droplet radius @xmath66 at the appearance of the clarification zone can be computed from eq .",
    "[ rayon ] .",
    "@xmath66 ranges between 3.3 and 8.9 @xmath56 m .",
    "knowing that the diffusivity of spherical droplets immersed in a liquid of viscosity @xmath70 is @xmath77 , , the mobility @xmath56 as @xmath78 with @xmath65 the hadamard sedimentation velocity of eq .",
    "[ hadamard ] taken with @xmath79 and @xmath80 the gravitational force exerting on the droplet . ]",
    "their pclet number @xmath81 can be computed : @xmath82 @xmath83 is found to range between 8 ( @xmath84% and @xmath85c ) and 371 ( @xmath86% and @xmath87c ) .",
    "recalling that these droplets experience almost no coalescence owing to their dilute environment , their growth is the slowest of the vessel , their radius is the smallest , and their velocity is minimal among all droplets , so we can argue that @xmath88 in the bulk sedimenting liquid .",
    "therefore gravitation - induced hydrodynamic interactions should prevail over brownian diffusion as the coalescence mechanism .    to confirm this statement",
    ", we consider theoretical studies on coalescence of non - brownian sedimenting polydisperse droplets immersed in an immiscible fluid @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the volume fraction of droplets with position in the vessel at different times ( fig .",
    "@xcite ) shows a strong closeness with our light attenuation curves of fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] . therefore the droplet density in our sedimenting mixture displays the same evolution as predicted for non - brownian droplets and , at variance with some predictions @xcite , the driving force of coalescence is likely to consist only of gravitational collisions .     and of the start of the plateau @xmath89 of the light attenuation curves as a function of time in the ( @xmath900.12 k ) case .",
    "the lines are least - square fits of the values . the @xmath91 time is also shown . ]",
    "what can we learn now about the drops growth law during this stage of phase separation ? to address this point , we focus on the early appearance of sedimentation . when growing droplets experience a gravitational force overwhelming brownian diffusion , the symmetry of their displacement is broken and they exhibit an average descending motion .",
    "this incipient settling motion can be traced in fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] through the displacement with time of the beginning @xmath89 of the curves plateau . in other words",
    ", we follow with @xmath89 the initial mean trajectory of the droplets settling from the meniscus .",
    "we concentrate on early times , where the interceipt of the rising curve and the plateau is unambiguous .",
    "if the pclet number @xmath92 , mean sedimentation velocity @xmath93 , and diffusivity @xmath94 of these settling droplets are known independantly , their radius can be computed , considering the definition of @xmath92 , via @xmath95 . using the above - mentionned stokes - einstein expression for @xmath94 ,",
    "one gets @xmath96 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 is given above and @xmath93 is accessible through the slope of the @xmath97 line ( cf . fig .",
    "[ position ] ) .",
    "so at this point , we need a determination of the only missing value , @xmath92 , to be able to calculate @xmath98 at least at one particular time of the coarsening .",
    "the sedimentation regime is entered when the pclet number sufficiently exceeds unity .",
    "we will tentatively consider that this is the case when the sedimentation velocity becomes one order of magnitude larger than the diffusive velocity .",
    "the time @xmath91 of this start of sedimentation is measured in extrapolating the @xmath97 curve to zero .",
    "@xmath97 has been seen to remain linear at early times , which enables a well - defined extrapolation of @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "[ position ] ) .",
    "so at @xmath91 we assume that @xmath99 and @xmath98 can be computed with the above - mentioned formula . as expected for droplets at the non sedimenting - sedimenting transition , @xmath98 ranges between 1.0 and 3.2 @xmath56 m for our quenches .",
    "therefore we use our knowledge of the sedimentation behaviour as a probe to determine the droplet radius @xmath98 just when sedimentation sets in .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath98 values of the different quenches are characteristic of the early coarsening mechanisms preceding sedimentation ( free growth , bd , ls ) and not related to the settling behaviour itself .    concerning the choice of @xmath92 ,",
    "wang and davis have performed computations in an immiscible mixture experiencing simultaneous brownian and gravitational collisions @xcite .",
    "using their predictions , we have computed the mean radius @xmath98 of the coalescing droplets after a time estimated as @xmath91 in the most unfavourable case of viscosity , dispersity and settling velocity .",
    "we find that @xmath100 1.5 @xmath101 ( @xmath101 initial radius ) for an initial pclet number @xmath102 and @xmath100 2.4 @xmath101 for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that 1 ) whatever the choice of @xmath92 , gravity has not significantly modified the coarsening dynamics after an elapsed time @xmath91 and 2 ) this minor influence on @xmath98 , if any , is comparable for @xmath92 ranging from 1 to 10 .",
    "furthermore @xmath103 which induces a weak influence of the choice of @xmath92 , between 1 and 10 , on the computation of @xmath98 .",
    "of the reduced droplet size @xmath104 at the end of the non - sedimenting regime ( black dots ) .",
    "the open triangles and squares are respectively the theoretical values of @xmath104 for an ostwald ripening and a brownian diffusion - coalescence growth .",
    "it should be noticed that each point corresponds to one experiment .",
    "ranges of growth exponents available in the literature for @xmath105% have also been added ( references given in the text ) . the quench depth @xmath106 and the volume fraction of the growing phase @xmath0 have been mentionned for some representative points . ]    to allow comparison between the dynamics of all experiments , we put the time and radius values in a dimensionless form : @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the renormalization quantities are the radius of an initial critical nucleus @xmath109 and the relaxation time of this nucleus @xmath110 , with @xmath111 a capillary length estimated as @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "we benefit now from one point @xmath113 for each experiment , covering five decades of reduced time . fig .",
    "[ sizes ] displays the evolution of @xmath104 as a function of @xmath114 .",
    "we first ascertain that all experiments merge onto a single curve , whatever the initial supersaturation .",
    "the second striking feature lies in the presence of a crossover between two coarsening stages .",
    "the first behaviour can tentatively be fitted by a power law of exponent @xmath115 .",
    "such a slow radius evolution is expected at the end of the free growth regime and reflects the overlapping of the solute - depleted shells around the nuclei @xcite .",
    "the second behaviour displays a growth exponent @xmath116 which is the well - known exponent of interface - reduction coarsenings ( ls and bd ) . to our knowledge",
    "this constitutes the first experimental observation of the crossover between free growth and constant volume - fraction coarsening in a liquid system .",
    "this crossover takes place at @xmath117 .",
    "the experimental and theoretical growth laws available for @xmath105% in the literature have also been added in fig .",
    "[ sizes ] .",
    "surprisingly , no other measurements exist in the @xmath118 range for @xmath119 except those of wong & knobler which seem to display a progressive change of slope and are therefore delicate to deal with @xcite and those of white & wiltzius , the dimensionless parameters of which are not available @xcite .",
    "concerning the end of free diffusion , our growth exponent is equivalent to siebert & knobler s one ( 0.18 ) @xcite and is compatible with the theoretical prediction of tokuyama & enomoto ( @xmath120 ) @xcite .",
    "the validity domain of this intermediate stage is also compatible with the @xmath121 range of buil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite but is not consistent with those of baumberger _",
    ". _ @xcite and cumming _ et al .",
    "the latter dealt with polymer blends and this could account for the dynamics discrepancy or at least for the difficulty of computing equivalent dimensionless quantities in simple ( acid / water ) and complex ( polymer blends ) fluids .",
    "the inconsistency with the former remains unexplained .",
    "the crossover time compares well with tokuyama & enomoto s theoretical value @xmath122 , the lower value computed at @xmath123 and the upper one at @xmath124 @xcite .",
