    "inspiraling binaries are one of the most promising sources for the first detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "the post newtonian approximation methods accurately describe the phasing of the waveform - about a cycle in a wave train @xmath0 cycles long .",
    "this makes it amenable for matched filtering analysis .",
    "the best available estimates suggest that the expected number of neutron star ( ns)-ns binary coalescence seen per year by ground based interferometers is @xmath1 for initial detectors and @xmath2 for advanced detectors @xcite . in recent years , a number of ground based detectors are producing sufficiently interesting sensitive data and analysis of network data is highly advisable .",
    "the advantages of multi - detector search for the binary inspiral is that , not only does it improve the confidence of detection , it also provides directional and polarisational information about the gw source .",
    "two strategies currently exist in searching for inspiraling binary sources with a network of detectors : the coherent and the coincident .",
    "the coherent strategy involves combining data from different detectors phase coherently , appropriately correcting for time - delays and polarization phases and obtaining a single statistic for the full network , that is optimized in the maximum likelihood sense . on the other hand",
    ", the coincident strategy matches the candidate event lists of individual detectors for consistency of the estimated parameters of the gw signal .",
    "however , the phase information is ignored and as also the detectors are considered in isolation .",
    "the question arises as to which strategy performs better . on simple waveforms",
    "the analysis has been performed by finn and arnaud et al@xcite .",
    "both these works have shown that the coherent strategy performs better than the coincident strategy .",
    "we consider here the astrophysically important source , namely , the inspiraling binary and report mainly the results of our work which has been described in detail in the papers @xcite .",
    "we compare the strategies by plotting the _ receiver operating characteristic _",
    "( roc ) curves , which is the plot of detection efficiency versus the false alarm rate .",
    "we broadly consider the two cases of co - located aligned detectors and geographically separated misaligned detectors . in the co - located case we further consider two subcases of ( i ) uncorrelated noise , and ( ii ) correlated noise .",
    "for the inspiraling binary , in the fourier domain we assume the spinless restricted post - newtonian ( pn ) waveform @xmath3 at detector @xmath4 : ^i ( f ) = e^i f^-7/6   i [ ( f ; t_c , _ c , _ 0 , _ 3 ) + 2 f t^i ] , [ eq : stilde ] where we take the phase @xmath5 given by the 3 pn formula .",
    "the extended beam pattern functions @xcite @xmath6 encode the orientation and direction parameters of the source and detectors ; the parameters @xmath7 , are respectively , the time of coalescence , phase of coalescence ; the quantities @xmath8 are the chirp time parameters which are independent functions of the two masses of the stars comprising the binary , the @xmath9 denote time - delays at the detector @xmath4 with respect to a fiducial detector and @xmath10 is the amplitude depending on the masses and the distance to the source .    in matched filtering , it is natural to define the scalar product @xmath11 of two real functions by , ( a , b ) = 2 _ f_l^i^f_u^i df  , [ eq : scalar ] where , we use the hermitian property of fourier transforms of real functions .",
    "@xmath12 is the one sided power spectral density ( psd ) of the noise which is assumed to be the same for all the detectors .",
    "then the normalised templates @xmath13 corresponding to the intrinsic parameters @xmath14 are defined via the equation , ^i(f;_i , t_c , _ c ) = ^i ( _ 0 ( f ; _ i , t_c ) _ c + _ /2 ( f ; _ i , t_c ) _ c ) .",
    "[ eq : quadrature ] we have the relation @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents a grid point in the intrinsic parameter space and the normalisation of templates requires that the scalar products @xmath17 .",
    "we then define the complex correlation @xmath18 where , the real correlations @xmath19 and @xmath20 are obtained by taking the scalar products of the data @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively ; that is , @xmath24 .",
    "then the single detector statistic for detector @xmath4 is just @xmath25 . to decide detection in a given single detector @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath26 is maximised over the template parameters @xmath27 and compared with a preassigned threshold .",
    "for coincidence detection , the procedure is as follows :    * choose the same threshold @xmath28 for the two detectors .",
    "* prepare two candidate event lists such that @xmath29 .",
    "look for pairs of candidate events , each candidate event coming from a different list , such that the sets of estimated parameters @xmath30 match - @xmath31 where the @xmath32 denotes the difference in the measured parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath33 stands for any of the parameters @xmath30 .",
    "the allowed error box is denoted by @xmath34 . a quadratic sum of the noises is taken to determine the error box .",
    "we fix this box by performing simulations , so that the final probability of not losing an event is @xmath35 - on each parameter ,",
    "we atmost allow 1 % loss in events . for geographically separated detectors , for fixing the window size in @xmath36 , the light travel time between the detectors",
    "is taken into account and added in quadratures to the errors due to noise in each detector .",
    "on the other hand , coherent detection involves combining data streams in a phase coherent manner so as to effectively construct a single , more sensitive detector .",
    "for the case of two misaligned detectors the network statistic is given by @xcite : = ||c||^2 = |c^1|^2 + |c^2|^2 = ( c^1_0)^2 + ( c^1_/2)^2 + ( c^2_0)^2 + ( c^2_/2)^2 , [ twoindep ] where @xmath37 is the complex correlation of the @xmath4-th detector ( @xmath4=1,2 ) .",
    "for two aligned colocated detectors the statistic is different @xcite and is given by : = |c^1 + c^2|^2 . for aligned colocated detectors we consider two subcases : ( i ) uncorrelated noise , ( ii ) correlated noise",
    "we first consider the case of co - located aligned detectors .",
    "this case would be of significance to the two ligo detectors at hanford and other similar topologies envisaged elsewhere in the future such as lcgt .",
    "we compare the performances of the two strategies by plotting the roc curves for uncorrelated noise ( left ) and correlated noise ( right ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . for plotting these curves the false alarm and the detection probabilities must be computed as a function of the threshold @xmath28 and then plotted versus each other parametrically by varying the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath38 is taken as the weighted average of a frequency dependent correlation @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the noise in the @xmath42 detector .",
    "details may be found in @xcite .",
    "while performing the simulations there are many subtleties such as estimating the number of independent templates , the error window size computation etc .",
    "the discussion of which we have omitted here although it is nonetheless important .",
    "cc    it is clear from the figures that the coherent strategy is far superior in this case .",
    "we now consider the case of geographically separated detectors which are then also normally misaligned . when the detectors are misaligned , the sky coverage for the usual coincidence detection is very poor which leads to intolerable false dismissal .",
    "thus another coincidence strategy is devised which we call _ enhanced _ coincidence .",
    "the usual coincidence strategy we then call _ naive _ coincidence .",
    "enhanced coincidence strategy is formulated as follows :    * choose a low threshold @xmath43 ( we choose @xmath44 ) , and prepare two candidate event lists such that @xmath45 . *",
    "look for a pair of candidate events , the events coming from separate lists , such that the sets of estimated parameters match within the error - window .",
    "the procedure is the same as the co - located case , except for the parameter @xmath36 in which the distance between the detectors enters .",
    "* choose the final ( high ) threshold @xmath46 and construct the final statistic @xmath47 and register detection if @xmath48 .",
    "cc    note that although this statistic looks formally like the coherent case , the mass parameters for the templates in the two detectors do not have to be the same ( they however must be close enough so that they lie in a error window ) .",
    "thus this is not matched filtering while coherent detection is . in this strategy",
    "the sky coverage is better than naive coincidence . as seen from the fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , coincidence strategy performs far better than the naive coincidence strategy , but we see that the detection probability for the coherent strategy is still superior by around 5% for the same false alarm rate .",
    "although the coherent strategy is superior to coincident strategies , the difference between the coherent and enhanced coincident strategies is small",
    ". only a relative improvement of about 5% in the detection probability is obtained with the coherent strategy .",
    "one may ask whether there is any practical advantage in using the coherent strategy in the case of two misaligned detectors .",
    "note however that the coherent method is not so computationally expensive compared with two coincident methods , since we do not take cross correlation of two detectors data in the coherent strategy .",
    "thus overall , we conclude that the coherent strategy is a good detection method .    however , the above results assume stationary gaussian noise .",
    "but we know that the current real data are neither stationary nor gaussian . in coincidence detection , the requirement of the consistency of estimated parameters in an error window acts as a powerful veto @xcite to veto out fake events generated from non - gaussian noise . on the ther hand in coherent detection as yet no such obvious veto has been developed .",
    "this however does not rule out the possibility that a powerful veto can not be constructed for the coherent strategy . in future",
    "we propose to work on this aspect of the problem .",
    "perhaps a judicious combination of the two methods might be an effective way of dealing with this problem .",
    "the authors would like to thank the dst , india and jsps , japan for the indo - japanese cooperative programme for scientists and engineers under which this work has been carried out ."
