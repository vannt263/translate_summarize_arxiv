    "after the pioneering work by schwinger @xcite , there has been a lot of work on various aspects of a quantum system @xmath7 with variables in @xmath0 ( the ring of integers modulo @xmath8 ) , described with a @xmath8-dimensional hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "the work combines quantum physics with discrete mathematics and has applications to areas like quantum information , quantum cryptography , quantum coding , etc ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "a deep problem in this area is mutually unbiased bases @xcite .",
    "it is a set of bases , for which the absolute value of the overlap of any two vectors in two different bases is @xmath10 .",
    "it is known that the number @xmath11 of mutually unbiased bases satisfies the inequality @xmath12 , and that when @xmath8 is a prime number @xmath13 .",
    "what makes the case of prime @xmath8 special , is that @xmath0 becomes a field , which is a stronger mathematical structure than a ring .",
    "for the same reason , if we consider quantum systems with variables in the galois field @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a prime number ) , the number of mutually unbiased bases is @xmath16 .",
    "the study of mutually unbiased bases for non - prime @xmath8 , in which case @xmath0 is a ring ( but not a field ) , is a very difficult problem .",
    "it is also related to the subjects of @xmath17-designs@xcite and latin squares@xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite introduced a weaker concept called weak mutually unbiased bases ( wmub ) .",
    "it is a set of bases , for which the absolute value of the overlap of any two vectors in two different bases is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( @xmath18 is a divisor of @xmath8 ) , or zero .",
    "it has been shown that there are @xmath19 ( the dedekind @xmath20-function ) wmubs .",
    "this work has also studied the phase space @xmath4 as a finite geometry @xmath21 .",
    "there exists much literature on finite geometries .",
    "they consist of a finite number of points and lines which obey certain axioms ( e.g. , @xcite in a mathematics context , and @xcite in a physics context ) .",
    "most of this work is on near - linear geometries , where two lines have at most one point in common .",
    "the @xmath4 geometry is based on rings and it does not obey this axiom .",
    "two lines have in common a ` subline ' which consists of @xmath18 points , where @xmath2 .",
    "refs@xcite have shown that there is a duality between wmubs in @xmath9 and lines in @xmath21 .",
    "this shows a deep connection between finite quantum systems and the geometries of their phase spaces .",
    "a very different problem is the use of analytic functions in the context of physical systems .",
    "after the pioneering work by bargmann@xcite for the harmonic oscillator , analytic representations have been used with various quantum systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular the zeros of the analytic functions",
    "have been used for the derivation of physical results .",
    "for example , there are links between the growth of analytic functions at infinity , and the density of their zeros@xcite , which lead to criteria for the overcompleteness or undercompleteness of a von neumann lattice of coherent states .",
    "refs@xcite have studied analytic representations for quantum systems with variables in @xmath0 , using theta functions @xcite ( see also ref@xcite ) .",
    "quantum states are represented with analytic functions in the cell @xmath22 in the complex plane ( i.e. , in a torus ) .",
    "these analytic functions have exactly @xmath8 zeros in the cell @xmath23 , which determine uniquely the state of the system .",
    "in this paper we use this language of analytic functions for the study wmubs .",
    "we show that :    * each of the @xmath8 vectors in a wmub has @xmath8 zeros on a straight line . * in a given wmub , the various vectors have zeros on parallel lines . in different wmubs",
    ", the slope of the lines of zeros , is different . * the @xmath24 zeros in each wmub ,",
    "form a regular lattice in the cell @xmath23 , which is the same for all wmubs .    based on these results",
    "we show that there is a triality between    * wmubs * lines through the origin in the finite geometry @xmath21 of the phase space * sets of parallel lines of zeros of the vectors in wmubs in the cell @xmath23    these three mathematical objects , which are very different from each other , have the same mathematical structure .",
    "the work links the theory of analytic functions and their zeros , to finite quantum systems , finite geometries and more generally to discrete mathematics .    in order to avoid a complicated notation , in all sections except section",
    "ii , we consider the case that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are odd prime numbers , different from each other ( in section ii we state in each subsection , what values @xmath8 takes ) .",
    "all results are generalizable to the case @xmath25 , where @xmath8 is an odd integer ( see discussion ) . in the case of even dimension",
    "@xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , some aspects of the formalism of finite quantum systems require special consideration , and further work is needed in order to extend the ideas of the present paper , to this case . also when @xmath8 contains powers of prime numbers , further work is needed ( based on labeling with elements of galois fields ) .    in section 2",
    "we introduce very briefly finite quantum systems , their analytic representation , and mutually unbiased bases , in order to define the notation . in section 3",
    "we review briefly the formalism of weak mutually unbiased bases .",
    "an important ingredient is the factorization of @xmath7 in terms of smaller systems @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which is based on the chinese remainder theorem , and its use by good @xcite in the context of finite fourier transforms . in section 4 ,",
