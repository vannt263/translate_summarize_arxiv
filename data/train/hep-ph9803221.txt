    "the role played by virtual @xmath2 pairs in the low - energy structure of hadrons remains one of the outstanding questions for hadron structure physics . despite the evidence for important @xmath2 sea effects obtained with deep inelastic scattering , the experimental manifestations of explicit sea - quark effects at low energies are minimal .",
    "partial explanations for this absence have been given using a non - relativistic quark model framework by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who noted that in the adiabatic approximation , virtual @xmath2 pairs renormalize the string tension and , therefore , do not have any discernable impact on the low - lying spectrum of hadronic states .",
    "similarly , virtual @xmath2 effects  in the guise of virtual mesonic loops  which could conceivably lead to large @xmath3 and @xmath4 mixing were shown to cancel at second order in strong couplings when a sum is performed over a tower of virtual hadronic states @xcite .",
    "the latter result provides insight into the applicability of the ozi rule to @xmath5-@xmath6 mixing despite the nave scale of @xmath2 effects expected at one - loop order .",
    "nevertheless , several mysteries involving @xmath2 pairs remain to be solved .",
    "of particular interest are those involving nucleon matrix elements of strange quark operators , @xmath7 .",
    "the latter explicitly probe properties of the @xmath2 sea at low energies , since the nucleon contains no valence strange quarks .",
    "moreover , the mass scale associated with @xmath8 pairs ",
    "@xmath9  implies that such pairs live for sufficiently long times and propagate over sufficiently large distances to produce observable effects when probed explicitly . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath8 pairs stand in contrast with , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath10 pairs , whose effects one expects to be suppressed by powers of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "some support for these simple - minded expectations is provided by determinations of @xmath12 from the @xmath13 sigma \" term @xcite and of @xmath14 from polarized deep inelastic scattering @xcite and neutrino - nucleus quasi - elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the former suggests that roughly 15% of the nucleon mass is generated by @xmath8 pairs , while the latter implies that strange quarks contribute about 30% of the total quark contribution to the nucleon spin .",
    "measurements of @xmath15 , which would provide information about the strange quark contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment and rms radius are presently underway at mit - bates @xcite , mainz @xcite , and the jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "the first results for the strangeness magnetic form factor have been reported in ref .",
    "one expects this set of @xmath16 determinations to provide a clearer picture of the @xmath2 sea than obtained from existing spectroscopic data alone .    despite over a decade of theoretical efforts to study nucleon strangeness ,",
    "the theoretical understanding of s - quark matrix elements remains in its infancy . in the case of @xmath15 , a plethora of predictions",
    "have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "while a few lattice results have been obtained by different groups@xcite , they are not entirely consistent with each other nor with the recent first results for the strange magnetic moment \" obtained by the sample collaboration@xcite .",
    "the remaining predictions  based generally on qcd - inspired nucleon models @xcite or low - energy truncations of qcd in a hadronic basis @xcite  display a broad range in magnitude and sign .",
    "recently , it has been shown why such truncations  either in the strong coupling constant ( @xmath17 ) expansion ( loop order ) @xcite or hadronic excitation energy ( @xmath18 ) @xcite  are untrustworthy and may produce misleading results .",
    "the implication of these studies is that the intuitively appealing picture of a kaon cloud around the nucleon does not suffice to describe @xmath8 fluctuations in the nucleon .",
    "it appears that one must include both the full set of virtual hadronic intermediate states @xcite as well as the full set of higher - order rescattering effects for a given state @xcite in order to obtain a physically realistic prediction . in principle , corrections to the leading order truncations in @xmath18 and @xmath17 could be accounted for by the appropriate low - energy constants in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) ; however , chiral symmetry does not afford a determination of the low - energy constant relevant to nucleon vector current strangeness @xcite .",

    "we make the same replacement in the integrals for the @xmath248 intermediate state .",
    "this procedure leads to a crude upper bound on the contribution to the integrals from the integration region @xmath249 .",
    "the results of the dr estimates of the various contributions are quoted in table i. the dr results for the @xmath21 contribution given in table i were obtained using the rigorous unitarity bound .",
    "we stress that the @xmath38 results give rough upper bounds on the various contributions , not only because of the boundedness of the strong amplitudes but also because the phase difference correction , @xmath194 , is not known .",
    "we also do not compute the total contributions from the various states , as we can not presently determine their relative phases . only in the one - loop calculation of the previous section",
    "are the relative phases fixed by the model .",
    "the results shown in table i illustrate the two primary conclusions of our analysis : ( i ) contributions from higher mass intermediate states to the strangeness moments are not necessarily small compared with those from the lightest  ozi allowed \" state @xmath21 ; ( ii ) estimating these higher mass contributions can entail a significant degree of theoretical uncertainty .    in the one - loop model",
    ", the @xmath38 contributions can be as much as an order of magnitude larger than those from the kaon loop .",
    "the origin of this result can be traced to two factors : the tensor coupling of the @xmath250 vertex is much larger than the @xmath251 coupling , and the cut - off of the bonn form factor involving the @xmath38 is about twice as large as that involving the kaon ( @xmath252 gev ) . in the case of the former , omitting the tensor coupling reduces the contribution to the strangeness radius by a factor of five to ten and yields a near exact cancellation between the @xmath253 , @xmath248 , and @xmath254 contributions . in the case of the strange magnetic moment , the large @xmath254 and @xmath248 contributions drop by two orders of magnitude when @xmath43 is set to zero .",
    "the effect of the larger cut - off is particularly emphasized in graphs which contain derivative ( _ i.e. _ tensor ) couplings of the @xmath38 .",
    "these couplings bring in additional powers of the loop momentum @xmath53 and the corresponding loop integrals therefore receive larger contributions from @xmath53 of the order of the cut - off .",
    "however , the importance of loop momenta above @xmath2552 gev points to weaknesses of the one loop approximation . as we discuss in more detail below",
    ", the large @xmath256 and @xmath257 contributions ( 1b ) appear to result from un - physical , un - realistically large values of the integrand for large loop momenta .",
    "physically realistic contributions from these intermediate states are likely to be much smaller .    in fact , the dr contributions from the @xmath175 and @xmath181 states are significantly smaller in magnitude than those generated in the loop model , though they are still comparable to , or larger than , the @xmath21 contribution .",
    "the reduction in the magnitude of these contributions from the loop model estimate reflects two factors : the boundedness of the @xmath136 scattering amplitude in the physical region and the presence of more realistic , non - pointlike @xmath126 .",
    "although we have only implemented the boundedness crudely for the @xmath248 and @xmath254 states , the requirement that the partial waves are bounded in the physical region ( @xmath258 ) is a rigorous one , following from the unitarity of the s - matrix .",
    "since a one - loop calculation is equivalent to a dr in which the @xmath126 are taken to be pointlike and the @xmath192 computed in the born approximation , the one - loop results do not respect the boundedness requirement . the presence of hadronic form factors [ eqs .",
    "( [ ff ] ) ] does not remedy this violation since they preserve the on - shell form for the @xmath136 amplitudes .    in the @xmath21 case ,",
    "the unitarity violation of the one - loop calculation was shown to be a serious one @xcite . for the intermediate states containing a @xmath38",
    ", this violation appears to be all the more serious , as a comparison of the dr and loop results suggests .",
    "the tensor coupling of the @xmath38 to baryons weights the @xmath259 and @xmath260 amplitudes more strongly in the physical region , relative to the un - physical region ( @xmath261 ) , than in the @xmath262 case .",
    "consequently , the physical region contributes a substantial fraction of the entries ( 1b ) for the @xmath263 and @xmath181 states ( 80% of the total in the @xmath181 case )  even after the imposition of a crude bound on the @xmath192 and inclusion of non - pointlike @xmath185 . had we not imposed even our rough bound , the @xmath181 contribution to @xmath264 , for example , would have been five times larger .",
    "we conclude that the large contributions to the strangeness moments resulting from the one - loop model are not physically realistic .",
    "we emphasize that the dr calculation given here  though containing more physical information than the one - loop model  remains incomplete . a rigorous unitarity bound for the @xmath263 and",
    "@xmath181 amplitudes remains to be implemented , as has been done in the @xmath21 case .",
    "more importantly , the impact of higher order ( in @xmath17 ) rescattering corrections and possible resonance effects in the @xmath265 must also be estimated . in the @xmath21 case",
    ", these effects significantly enhance the @xmath266 contribution over the entry @xmath267 ( 1b ) in table i @xcite .",
    "this enhancement arises primarily from a near threshold @xmath127-resonance in the @xmath262 amplitude .",
    "similarly , we expect inclusion of @xmath263 and @xmath181 rescattering and @xmath134 resonance effects in the @xmath192 to modify the @xmath263 and @xmath181 entries in table i. unfortunately , sufficient @xmath268 ( or @xmath269 ) and @xmath270 ( @xmath271 _ etc .",
    "_ ) data do not presently exist to afford a model - independent determination of these effects .    given that higher mass contributions to the strangeness moments need not be small compared to that from the @xmath21 , it is desireable to reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the former as much as possible .",
    "the @xmath257 ( 1b ) entry hints at the level of this uncertainty . our reasonable range \" for this contribution",
    "allows for about a factor of four to seven variation , which follows from the choice of different , but reasonable , @xmath38 strangeness form factors .",
    "based on our previous study of the @xmath21 contribution , as well as the behavior of the scattering amplitudes in the physical region , we may reasonably expect a similar level of uncertainty associated with the presently unknown rescattering and resonance effects in the @xmath272 .    to summarize , we have estimated @xmath263 and @xmath181 contributions to the nucleon strangeness moments , using two approaches which complement the quark model calculation of ref . @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the conclusions reached in that work that higher mass hadronic states can be as important as the @xmath21 state and that a calculation of the strangeness moments based on a truncation in @xmath18 is not reliable .",
    "similarly , we illustrate the significant theoretical ambiguities involved in estimating these higher mass contributions  particularly those associated with effects going beyond @xmath22 and with the intermediate state strangeness form factors . in this study",
    ", we have taken the first steps toward including the latter in a realistic way .",
    "we find that inclusion of physically reasonable parameterizations of the @xmath126 can appreciably affect the @xmath263 and @xmath181 contributions .",
    "even here , however , our efforts are limited by a lack of existing em data . in the case of higher - order and resonance effects in the strong amplitudes",
    ", it should be evident that simple models which do not account for them can produce physically unrealistic estimates of the higher mass intermediate state contributions .",
