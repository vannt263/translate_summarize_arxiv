    "one of the most important parameters of the fermi acceleration is the rate at which it operates .",
    "indeed , what is often predicted or even observed is a power - law spectrum that cuts off due to the finite acceleration time",
    ". the cut - off momentum @xmath3 advances with time as follows    @xmath4    while the acceleration time is determined by ( e.g. , axford , 1981 )    @xmath5 \\frac{dp}{p}\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the upstream and downstream flow speeds in the shock frame whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the particle diffusivities in the respective media .",
    "these are the most sensitive quantities here which are determined by the rate at which particles are pitch angle scattered by the alfven turbulence .",
    "if the latter was just background turbulence in the interstellar medium , the acceleration process would be too slow to account for the galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "however it was realized ( e.g. , bell , 1978 ) that accelerated particles must create the scattering environment by themselves generating alfven waves via the cyclotron instability .",
    "this wave generation process proved to be very efficient ( e.g. , vlk 1984 ) so that the normalized wave energy density @xmath10 is related to the partial pressure @xmath11 of crs that resonantly drive these waves through    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the alfven mach number and @xmath14 is the shock ram pressure .",
    "often it is assumed that the turbulence saturates at @xmath15 , which means that the m.f.p . of pitch angle scattered particles",
    "is of the order of their gyro - radius @xmath16 .",
    "then , @xmath17@xmath18 , where @xmath19 stands for the bohm diffusion coefficient .",
    "hence , @xmath20 .",
    "however the acceleration rate ( [ t : acc ] ) with @xmath21 was found to be fast enough to explain the acceleration of crs in snrs up to the `` knee '' energy @xmath22 over their life time .",
    "the analyses of drury ( 1994 ) and naito and takahara ( 1994 ) of prospective detection of super - tev emission from nearby snr ( they must result from the decays of @xmath23 mesons born in collisions of shock accelerated cr protons with the nuclei of interstellar gas ) look equally optimistic . the expected fluxes were shown to be strong enough to be detected by the imaging cherenkov telescopes .",
    "moreover , the egret ( esposito 1996 ) detected a lower energy ( @xmath24 ) emission coinciding with some galactic snrs .",
    "unfortunately , despite the physical robustness of the above - mentioned predictions of emission , no statistically significant signal that could be attributed to any of the egret sources was detected ( buckley 1997 ) .",
    "the further complication is that the region between gev and tev energy bands is currently uncovered by any instrument .",
    "therefore , based on these observational results it was suggested ( e.g. , buckley 1997 ) that there is probably a spectral break or even cutoff somewhere within this band .",
    "in this paper we attempt to understand what may happen to the spectrum provided that the acceleration is indeed fast enough to access the tev energies over the life time of snrs in question .",
    "our starting point is that the fast acceleration also means that the pressure of accelerated particles becomes significant relatively early and must change the entire shock structure by this time . at the first glance",
    "this should not slow down acceleration since according to eq.([delb ] ) this increases the turbulence _ level _ improving thus particle confinement near the shock front and making acceleration faster . simultaneously with that but more importantly , the upstream flow is decelerated by the pressure of crs @xmath11 which influences the _",
    "spectral properties _ of the turbulence by affecting the propagation and excitation of the alfven waves .",
    "this effect is twofold .",
    "first the waves are compressed in the converging plasma flow upstream and are thus blue - shifted lacking the long waves needed to keep the high energy particles diffusively bound to the accelerator .",
    "second , and as a result of the first , at highest energies there remain relatively few particles so that the level of resonant waves is also small and hence the acceleration rate is low .",
    "we use the standard diffusion - convection equation for describing the transport of high energy particles ( crs ) near a cr modified shock    @xmath25    here @xmath26 is directed along the shock normal ( also the direction of the ambient magnetic field ) .",
    "the two quantities that control the acceleration process are the flow profile @xmath27 and the particle diffusivity @xmath28 .",
    "the first one is coupled to the particle distribution @xmath29 through the equations of mass and momentum conservation    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    is the pressure of the cr gas , and @xmath32 is the gas pressure .",
    "the lower boundary @xmath33 in the momentum space separates crs from the thermal plasma and enters the equations through the magnitude of @xmath29 at @xmath34 which specifies the injection rate .",
    "the particle momentum @xmath35 is normalized to @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the upstream region is @xmath37 half - space , and represent the velocity profile in the shock frame as @xmath38 where the ( positive ) flow speed @xmath39 jumps from @xmath40 downstream to @xmath41 across the subshock and then gradually increases up to @xmath42 ( see fig.1a ) . limiting our consideration to high mach number shocks , @xmath43 , we may drop @xmath32 term _ upstream , @xmath37_. it is retained at the subshock which , however , can be described by the conventional rankine - hugoniot jump condition    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the mach number in front of the subshock . for simplicity",
    "we use the adiabatic approximation , the far upstream mach number is related to @xmath45 by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the flow precompression in the cr precursor .    for determining the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath48",
    "one needs to write the wave kinetic equation for which we use the eikonal approximation    @xmath49    here @xmath50 is the number of wave quanta , @xmath51 is the wave frequency @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the wave number .",
    "the left hand side has a usual hamiltonian form that states the conservation of @xmath50 along the lines of constant frequency @xmath54 on the @xmath55 plane .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s . describes the wave generation on the cyclotron instability of a slightly anisotropic particle distribution .",
    "it can be expressed through its spatial gradient . the resonance condition @xmath56 ( `` resonance sharpening , '' drury 1996 [ d96 ] ) is implied .",
    "it is convenient to use the wave energy density normalized to @xmath57 and to the energy density of the background magnetic field @xmath58 instead of @xmath50    @xmath59    along with the partial pressure of crs normalized to @xmath60 and to the shock ram pressure @xmath61    @xmath62    using this variables , denoting @xmath63 , assuming a steady state and @xmath64 , eqs.([dc1],[wke ] ) rewrite    @xmath65    here the cr diffusion coefficient @xmath48 can be expressed through the wave intensity by @xmath66 .",
    "the difference between these equations and those used in d96 is due to the terms with @xmath67 . far away from the subshock where @xmath68 , one simply obtains @xmath69 .",
    "the most important change to the acceleration process comes from the terms with @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , let us recall first how the equation ( [ dc2 ] ) may be treated in the linear case @xmath70 for @xmath37 . integrating both sides between some @xmath37 and @xmath71 ,",
    "one obtains    @xmath72    where we denoted @xmath73 for @xmath64 .",
    "although this equation has a formal spatial scale @xmath74 , its only solution is a power law in @xmath26    @xmath75    and thus has no scale .",
    "it simply states the balance between the diffusive flux of particles escaping upstream ( second term in eq.[[cd : lin ] ] ) and their advection with thermal plasma in the downstream direction ( the first term ) . as we shall see , this balance is possible not everywhere upstream and the physical reason why it appears to be so robust in the case @xmath76 is that the flows of particles and waves on the @xmath77-plane ( including the diffusive particle transport ) are both directed along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "if , however , the flow modification upstream is significant ( @xmath78 , @xmath37 ) , the situation changes fundamentally . fig.1",
    "explains how the flows of particles and waves on the @xmath77-plane become misaligned even though they are both advected with the thermal plasma .",
    "in fact , the flows separate from each other and , since neither of them can exist without the other ( waves are generated by particles that , in turn , are trapped in the shock precursor by the waves ) they both disappear in that part of the phase space where the separation is strong enough . to understand how this happens it is useful to rewrite eqs.([dc2]-[wke2 ] ) in the following characteristic form",
    "( we return to the particle number density @xmath29 )    , [ wke3]).,width=313 ]    @xmath79    one sees from the l.h.s.s of these equations that particles are transported towards the subshock in @xmath26 and upwards in @xmath35 along the family of characteristics @xmath80 , whereas waves move also towards the subshock but downwards in @xmath35 along the characteristics @xmath81 .",
    "as long as @xmath39 does not significantly changes the waves and particles propagate together ( along @xmath26-axis ) as in the case of unmodified shock or far away from the subshock where @xmath82 .",
    "when the flow compression becomes important ( @xmath67 ) their separation leads to decrease of both the particle and wave energy densities towards the subshock . to describe this mathematically ,",
    "let us assume that the linear relation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is still a reasonable approximation even if @xmath85 is nonzero but small .",
    "( a more general case is considered in a longer version of this paper ) .",
    "then , integrating eq.([dc2 ] ) between some @xmath37 and @xmath86 , instead of ( [ cd : lin ] ) we obtain    @xmath87    in contrast to the solution of eq.([cd : lin ] ) the length scale @xmath88 enters the solution of this equation .",
    "this is because it has a nonzero r.h.s .",
    "the solution of this equation changes rapidly on a scale @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the total scale height of the cr precursor .",
    "in addition to @xmath26 and @xmath35 , we introduce a fast ( internal ) variable @xmath91 as follows    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is some special curve on the @xmath77 plane which bounds the solution and will be specified later .",
    "we rewrite eq.([cd : int ] ) for @xmath94 which leads to the solution    @xmath95    where @xmath96 , @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "eq.([g : intern ] ) describes the transition in the particle distribution between its asymptotic value @xmath100 at @xmath101 and @xmath102 at @xmath103 as a result of particle losses caused by the lack of resonant waves towards the subshock .",
    "the position of the transition front ( @xmath104 ) is determined by the condition of non - secular behaviour of the next order asymptotic expansion and must coincide with one of the characteristics of the operator on the l.h.s . of eq.([wke3 ] ) ,    @xmath105 or    @xmath106 the reasonable choice of the concrete characteristic is based on the existence of the absolute maximum momentum @xmath107 beyond which there are neither particles nor waves .",
    "that means @xmath108",

    ". this would be the external solution @xmath112 introduced above .",
    "it is clear that    @xmath113 so that from eq.([cd : int ] ) we have the following equation    @xmath114    the most important information about @xmath112 is contained in @xmath115 for which from the last equation we obtain    @xmath116    where we have introduced @xmath117 by    @xmath118    eq.([g0:eq ] ) can be easily solved for @xmath119    @xmath120    ( where @xmath121 is a constant )",
    ". however , the function @xmath122 depends on the solution itself .",
    "nevertheless , it can be calculated prior to determining @xmath119 and therefore , this solution may be written in a closed form . in the case @xmath123one obtains ( the shape of the cut - off )    @xmath124    in the rest of the @xmath77-domain where @xmath125 and @xmath35 is not close to @xmath126 , we may assume that the cr diffusion coefficient is close to its bohm value since in contrast to the phase space region @xmath127 at each given @xmath128 there are waves generated along the entire characteristic of eq.([wke2 ] ) passing through this point of the phase space and occupying an extended region of the cr precursor , fig.1 .",
    "we may adopt then the asymptotic high mach number solution ( malkov and drury 2001 [ md ] and references therein )    @xmath129 using the linear approximation for @xmath39 [ md ] @xmath130 with @xmath131 , where it is implied that the maximum contribution to the particle pressure comes from some momentum @xmath132 , we can express @xmath122 in the form of an error function integral    @xmath133\\ ] ] the further algebra simplifies in two limiting cases leading to the following asymptotic expressions for the particle distribution    @xmath134 this result is valid for @xmath135 , whereas for @xmath136 one still has @xmath137 , where the detailed calculations of @xmath138 , @xmath121 and @xmath139 may be found in md .",
