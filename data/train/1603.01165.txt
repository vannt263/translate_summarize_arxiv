    "the gpe is equivalent to a hydrodynamic model with fluid density @xmath77 and velocity @xmath78 , and embodies a classical continuity equation and a modified euler equation ( the modification being the presence of a quantum pressure term , arising from zero - point motion of the particles and responsible for vortex nucleation and reconnections ) .    within the gpe model and assuming a homogeneous particle density @xmath14 , the vortex core size is characterised by the healing length @xmath79 .",
    "the natural speed , energy and time scales are provided by the speed of sound @xmath80 , the chemical potential @xmath81 and the unit @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "our results are based on simulations of the gpe over the entire afm surface , resolved down to a sub - core scale of @xmath82 . in @xmath1he",
    "the vortex core size is @xmath83 @xcite , such that the @xmath84 afm image has true core dimensions @xmath85 .",
    "it is not computationally feasible to model the corresponding range of scales directly within the gpe ; as such we map the afm image onto the largest practical healing length volume of @xmath86 .",
    "this is simulated in a box of size @xmath87 ( the numerical domain being twice as high as the highest mountain in the third dimension ) , on a @xmath88 spatial grid , which is periodic in @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "time evolution is performed with 4th order runge - kutta scheme with time step @xmath89 , and performed across 256 ( 2.6 ghz ) cores of a computer cluster .",
    "the rough surface is incorporated into the gpe by setting a potential barrier @xmath90 below the surface , heavily prohibiting density there ; above the surface the density recovers to the bulk value @xmath14 ( where @xmath91 ) over a lengthscale of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "we first obtain the stationary solution of the gpe in the presence of the rough boundary , with bulk density @xmath14 , by solving the gpe in imaginary time @xcite .",
    "the gpe is then transformed into a frame moving at speed @xmath92 in the @xmath17-direction ( corresponding to the imposed flow ) by the addition of a galilean boost term @xmath93 to the right - hand side of the gpe .",
    "the flow speed is ramped up smoothly from zero to the required final value .",
    "we estimate the effective kinematic viscosity in the following way .",
    "consider the volume @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the extension in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 direction and @xmath96 is approximately the height of the turbulent layer in the @xmath32 direction .",

    "@xmath97 , the energy difference @xmath101 is deposited into the turbulence .",
    "since we are dealing with a statistical steady state , this energy is also dissipated into sound waves when vortices accelerate around each other @xcite or reconnect @xcite ( including reconnections with images across the rough surface ) . for the sake of simplicity , we group the small vortex rings which are emitted by the turbulent layer with the sound waves .     in time",
    "@xmath97 , the energy ( per unit mass ) dissipated by the turbulence is thus @xmath102 . following walmsley and golov s @xcite analysis of their experiments in low - temperature he@xmath1 , we use the classical result that relates the rate of energy dissipation ( per unit mass ) , @xmath103 , to the kinematic viscosity @xmath53 and the vorticity @xmath104 of the fluid , @xmath105     we also make the identification @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the vortex line density , defined as the vortex length @xmath31 per unit volume @xmath108 ( for the sake of simplicity , we neglect the volume of the ` mountains ' and identify @xmath109 ) .",
    "the ` emergent kinematic viscosity ' @xmath53 of the superfluid s turbulent layer can therefore be estimated from the balance between the energy ( per unit mass per unit time ) , @xmath110 which is fed into the turbulence by the incoming flow , and the energy ( per unit mass per unit time ) @xmath111 which is dissipated into waves .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath53 in terms of the quantum of circulation @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain , @xmath112     in our dimensionless units based on @xmath3 and @xmath15 , the quantum of circulation is @xmath113 . at the three applied flow speeds we find that the saturated turbulent layer has length ( see fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath114 and @xmath115 corresponding to @xmath116 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "these values are larger than @xmath56 reported @xcite in experimental studies of the ` vinen ' ( or ` ultraquantum ' ) turbulent regime in he@xmath1 .",
    "we argue that the explanation of this difference is that in the helium experiments the vortex lines are relatively farther away from each other .",
    "since dissipation arises from sound emission from rapidly accelerating vortices and from vortex reconnections , we expect more dissipation in our problem .    to quantify the relative separation between the vortex lines , we compare the average intervortex distance @xmath57 to the vortex core radius @xmath58 , which is @xmath83 in helium and @xmath117 in our problem .",
    "clearly , at the smallest distance between two vortex lines , @xmath118 , the two vortices either rotate around each other with speed approaching the speed of sound , or undergo a vortex reconnection , turning kinetic into acoustic energy at the highest rate .",

    "<S> is the nature of turbulence in superfluids @xcite , a state consisting of an irregular tangle of quantised vortex lines . despite fundamental differences between superfluids and classical fluids , the observations of kolmogorov energy spectra ( famed from classical isotropic turbulence ) in superfluid turbulence @xcite are suggestive of a deep connection between them . </S>",
    "<S> superfluid turbulence is nowadays most commonly formed by moving obstacles , including grids @xcite , wires @xcite , forks @xcite , propellers @xcite , spheres @xcite and other objects @xcite . despite progress in visualizing the flow of superfluid helium in the bulk @xcite , including individual vortex reconnections @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the study of flow profiles @xcite is still in its infancy and there is no direct experimental evidence about what happens at boundaries . here , </S>",
    "<S> vortices are believed to be generated by two mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , vortices can nucleate at the boundary of the vessel or object @xcite . when the relative flow speed is sufficiently low , the flow is laminar ( potential ) and dissipationless . near curved boundaries </S>",
    "<S> , however , intrinsic vortex nucleation occurs if the local flow velocity exceeds a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the vortices can be procreated ( extrinsically generated ) by the ` vortex - mill ' mechanism@xcite from so - called ` remanent vortices ' which are present in the system since cooling the helium through the superfluid transition . </S>",
    "<S> remanent vortices can be avoided using judicious , slow experimental protocols @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nano - scale vortex core in superfluid helium is comparable in size to the typical roughness of the boundaries of the vessel or stirring object . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the lack of direct experimental information about vortex nucleation at the boundaries and the subsequent vortex - boundary interactions , limit the interpretation of experiments . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical progress is challenging and to date has focussed on smooth and idealised surfaces . in principle , the superfluid boundary conditions are straightforward : the superfluid velocity component which is perpendicular to the boundary must vanish at the boundary , whereas the tangential component ( in the absence of viscous stresses ) can slip . for the latter reason , in superfluids we do not expect boundary layers typical of viscous flows . implementing these superfluid boundary conditions , it was found@xcite that one or more vortices sliding along a smooth surface can become deflected or trapped by small hemispherical bumps . </S>",
    "<S> such bumps can also serve as nucleation sites for vortices ; the local superfluid velocity is raised at the pole of the bump and more readily breaks the critical velocity for vortex nucleation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our recent simulations@xcite have shown that , if the bump is elliptically shaped and elongated perpendicular to the imposed flow , the superfluid velocity @xmath6 at the pole is enhanced , reducing the critical mach number for vortex nucleation from @xmath7 to smaller values @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the ellipticity of the bump ) , and increasing the intrinsic vortex nucleation rate ( for a given super - critical imposed flow ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect therefore that microscopically - small surface roughness may promote the nucleation of vortices at a surface . </S>",
    "<S> for pre - existing vortex lines in the vicinity of the surface , there is also indirect experimental evidence of a ` vortex mill ' mechanism which continuously feeds vorticity into the flow by stretching any pre - existing vortex lines . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism only works if the spooling vortex , held by pinning sites at the surface , is aligned in the streamwise direction @xcite . in summary , boundary roughness potentially affects both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanism to create new vortices .    afm image of a section of the nbti wire rough surface , smoothed by a gaussian blur ( standard deviation 6 nm ) so as to remove discontinuities in the surface profile . ]    to shed light on the problem , we work with the 3d profile of a rough surface [ fig .  [ fig : afmsmooth ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a ( @xmath10m)@xmath11 region of the surface of a thin nbti wire used to generate quantum turbulence at lancaster university , as profiled via atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the surface is rough , with a height up to around 10 nm , and features sharp grooves and steep ridges , likely to have arisen during the etching phase of the wire preparation . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that such a ` mountain ' landscape is typical of the wires and similar objects used in experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the flow of superfluid helium over this surface through the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for a weakly - interacting bose superfluid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gpe describes a fluid , of density @xmath12 and velocity @xmath13 , which follows a classical continuity equation and a modified euler equation ( the modification being the presence of a quantum pressure term , arising from zero - point motion of the particles and responsible for vortex nucleation and reconnections ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the gpe provides only a qualitative model of the strongly - interacting superfluid helium ( for example , the gpe s excitation spectrum lacks helium s roton minimum ) , it nevertheless contains the key microscopic physical ingredients of our problem : finite - size vortex core , vortex interactions and vortex reconnections . </S>",
    "<S> the more traditional vortex filament model @xcite , used to model the motion of vortex lines in the presence of smooth spherical @xcite , hemispherical @xcite and cylindrical boundaries @xcite , is less appropriate for a number of reasons : it assumes that the vortex core is infinitesimal compared to any other length scale ( which is not the case if vortex core and wall roughness are comparable ) ; it does not contain vortex nucleation and kinetic energy losses due to sound emission ; and it is difficult to generalise from smooth , geometrically simple ( cylindrical or spherical ) boundaries to rough boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> the bulk fluid has uniform average density @xmath14 , with the surface imposed as an impenetrable region . </S>",

    "<S> most of the computational volume is below the average surface , and only the fluid in the valleys contributes to @xmath50 , which rapidly drops to near zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the energy which is fed into the turbulent layer by the incoming ( uniform ) flow profile and the energy removed by the ( approximately linear ) profile is the energy dissipated into sound waves @xcite . in classical turbulence </S>",

    "<S> boundary layers arise from viscous forces which are absent in low temperature superfluid helium . </S>",
    "<S> a classical fluid boundary layer is either laminar or turbulent , and it is natural to ask whether there is any transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer for our problem . in classical laminar flow , sheets of fluid slide past each other , smoothly exchanging momentum and energy only via molecular collisions at the microscopic scale ; in the turbulent case , eddies induce mixing across sheets which are macroscopically separated from each other . </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid analog of laminar flow is potential ( vortex - free ) flow . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show either vortex - free flow or turbulent flows past the rough surface , so they describe a transition from laminar flow to developed turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom region of fluid ( @xmath52 ) is a poor analog to a classical laminar viscous sub - layer because it contains irregular vortex lines which terminate at the boundary .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our findings illustrate a deep analogy between classical and quantum fluids in the presence of boundaries , besides the analogies already noticed@xcite in homogeneous isotropic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest that the walls which confine the flow of superfluid helium and the surfaces of moving objects used to generate turbulence ( wires , grids , propellers , spheres ) may be covered by a thin layer of tangled vortex lines . </S>",
