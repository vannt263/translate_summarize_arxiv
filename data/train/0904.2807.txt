    "it is well - known that entanglement of quantum state is a valuable physical resource in quantum information theories@xcite .",
    "it makes the quantum teleportation@xcite and superdense coding@xcite possible within the quantum mechanical law .",
    "furthermore , it is the physical resource which is responsible for the speed - up of the quantum computer@xcite . in this reason",
    "there has been a flurry of activity recently in the research of entanglement .",
    "many new properties for the entanglement of three- or higher - qubit pure states have been reported in the recent papers@xcite .",
    "however , it is in general much more difficult to understand the properties of entanglement for the mixed states except bipartite case .",
    "these difficulties are mainly originated from the fact that the mixed state entanglement is defined by a convex - roof extension@xcite of the pure state entanglement . in order to compute the entanglement defined by convex - roof method",
    "one should derive the optimal decomposition for the given mixed state . generally , however , it is highly non - trivial task to derive the optimal decomposition for the arbitrary mixed states .",
    "this computational difficulty makes it difficult to characterize the multipartite entanglement for the mixed states .    for the bipartite qubit states , fortunately ,",
    "wootters found how to derive the optimal decomposition for the concurrence , entanglement measure for the bipartite states , in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , one can compute the concurrence @xmath11 for the arbitrary mixed states @xmath12 by wootters formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 s are the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the hermitian matrix @xmath15    complete understanding on the bipartite concurrence makes it possible to derive the purely three - party entanglement , called three - tangle , for the three - qubit pure states@xcite .",
    "this arises from the observation that the three - qubit pure state @xmath16 satisfies the following inequality @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are concurrences for the reduced states @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a concurrence between a pair @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". therefore , @xmath22 represents an total entanglement of the qubit @xmath24 arising due to the remaining qubits . for pure state @xmath25 reduces to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and is called one - tangle . in this sense",
    ", the inequality ( [ ckw1 ] ) indicates that the total one - tangle is greater than sum of two - tangles .",
    "in addition , this observation naturally implies that @xmath28 , which is called three - tangle , represents the purely three - way entanglement . for three - qubit pure state @xmath29 ,",
    "the three - tangle @xmath30 becomes@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 the three - tangle defined by eq.([3-tangle-1 ] ) exactly coincides with the modulus of a cayley s hyperdeterminant@xcite and is an invariant quantity under the local @xmath33 transformation@xcite .",
    "the three - tangle ( [ 3-tangle-1 ] ) has following two important properties .",
    "firstly , for a completely separable ( @xmath34 ) and biseparable ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) states @xmath30 becomes zero .",
    "this means that the three - tangle is truly the pure three - party quantity related to the entanglement .",
    "secondly , the three - tangles for the greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz)@xcite and w@xcite states defined @xmath38 since the whole three - qubit pure states can be classified by completely separable , biseparable , ghz - type , and w - type states through stochastic local operation and classical communication(slocc)@xcite , eq.([ghzandw ] ) indicates that the three - tangle does not properly reflect the three - party entanglement of the w - type states .    for the mixed states",
    "the three - tangle is defined by a convex - roof method@xcite as follows : @xmath39 where the minimum is taken over all possible ensembles of pure states .",
    "the pure state ensemble corresponding to the minimum @xmath30 is called optimal decomposition .",
    "it is in general highly difficult to derive the optimal decomposition for the arbitrary mixed states .",
    "fortunately , lohmayer et al@xcite have derived recently the optimal decomposition when the mixed state @xmath12 is @xmath40 and have computed the three - tangle explicitly .",
    "they also have found that the coffman - kundu - wootters(ckw ) inequality ( [ ckw1 ] ) holds for mixed states as well as pure states .",
    "subsequently , the three - tangle for the rank-@xmath41 mixed state composed of the generalized ghz and generalized w states has been computed in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite furthermore , the optimal decompositions and the three - tangle for the rank-@xmath42 mixed state composed of ghz , w , and flipped w states are also explicitly derived .",
    "most recently , the three - tangle for the rank-@xmath43 mixed states composed of @xmath43-different ghz states are explicitly computed in ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , in order to reflect the three - party entanglement of the w - type states properly",
    "we need to define new three - party entanglement measure different from the three - tangle .",
    "one of the candidate is a @xmath0-tangle discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-tangle is defined in terms of the global negativities@xcite defined @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and the superscripts @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the partial transpositions for the @xmath24-qubit , @xmath49-qubit and @xmath50-qubit respectively . due to the separability criterion via partial transposition@xcite",
    "it is easy to show that the global negativities vanish for the separable states .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the computation of the global negativities is relatively simple compared to concurrence or three - tangle for the mixed states since it does not need the convex - roof extension .",
    "in addition , the negativities also satisfy the monogamy inequality @xmath51 like concurrence .",
    "then , the @xmath0-tangle is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 it is easy to show that the @xmath0-tangles for @xmath54 and @xmath55 become @xmath56 thus the @xmath0-tangle reflects the three - party entanglement of the w - type states unlike the three - tangle .    in this paper",
    "we would like to explore the physical role of the three - party entanglement in the real quantum information process . in order to discuss this issue",
    "we adopt the tripartite teleportation scheme discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "similar issue was discussed in ref.@xcite , where the physical role of the concurrence is discussed in the bipartite teleportation through noisy channels .",
    "ref.@xcite has shown that the concurrences of the mixed state quantum channels arising due to some noises vanish in the region of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an average fidelity between initial alice s unknown state and final bob s state .",
    "since @xmath59 corresponds to the best possible score when alice and bob communicate with each other through the classical channel@xcite , this result indicates that the entanglement of the quantum channel is a genuine physical resource for the teleportation process .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we re - formulate the tripartite teleportation process@xcite in terms of the density matrix .",
    "this re - description allows us to formulate the tripartite teleportation process when quantum channel is mixed state .",
    "the several basic quantities are calculated in this section , which are essential for the calculation of various fidelities in next sections . in section iii",
    "we compute the accomplice s fidelities and receiver s fidelities when the tripartite teleportation process is performed through noisy channels . in section",
    "iv we compute the @xmath0-tangles for the various noisy channels .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0-tangles for all noise channels decrease with increasing the decoherence parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this is in fact expected due to the fact that the decoherence in general disentangles the entanglement of quantum states like `` sudden death '' .",
    "the @xmath0-tangle for x- and z - noise channels vanish at the @xmath1 limit .",
    "however , the @xmath0-tangles for y- and isotropy - noise channels are found to be non - zero at the finite range of @xmath2 . in section",
    "v we compute the three - tangles for the x- and z - noise channels .",
    "it is shown that the three - tangle for the z - noise channel is exactly same with the corresponding @xmath0-tangle .",
    "the three - tangle for the x - noise channel is shown to have three different expressions depending on the range of @xmath2 . since the channels for the y- and isotropy - noises are rank-@xmath10 mixed states , there is no general method to compute the three - tangles .",
    "however , we derived the upper bound of these three - tangles . in section",
    "vi we analyze the @xmath0-tangle and three - tangle by making use of the receiver s fidelities .",
    "the @xmath0-tangle seems to be too large to have a nice physical interpretation .",
    "the three - tangle also seems to be too small by similar manner .",
    "this analysis strongly suggests that we may need different three - party entanglement measure whose value is between three - tangle and @xmath0-tangle .",
    "in this section we want to re - formulate the tripartite teleportation scheme in terms of the density matrices@xcite .",
    "it involves sender ( alice ) , accomplice ( bob ) and receiver ( charlie ) .",
    "initially they share each single qubit of the ghz state , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 .",
    "the purpose of the tripartite teleportation is as follows .",
    "firstly , alice at location @xmath41 should transport a single qubit state @xmath61 to the receiver , charlie , at location @xmath43 with fidelity @xmath62 as high as possible with the help of the accomplice , bob , at location @xmath42 . at the second time alice should transport @xmath63 to the accomplice , bob , with fidelity @xmath64 as high as possible",
    "of course , we can not make @xmath65 due to no - cloning / broadcast theorems@xcite .",
    "the task is accomplished if one can make @xmath64 and @xmath62 as high as possible . in this sense",
    "the tripartite teleportation scheme is similar to a quantum copier ( cloning device)@xcite .    from the postulate of quantum mechanics on composite systems the initial state of the tripartite teleportation process",
    "should be @xmath66 as will be discussed below @xmath67 will be changed into @xmath68 when noise is introduced when alice , bob and charlie prepare the ghz state initially , where @xmath69 is a quantum operation@xcite .    at the next stage alice performs a projective measurement by preparing a set of the measurement operators @xmath70 with @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 form a bell basis , the operators satisfy the completeness constraint @xmath74 from the quantum mechanical postulates the probability @xmath75 , probability that the result of the alice s measurement is @xmath76 , is given by @xmath77\\ ] ] and the state of the system after the alice s measurement reduces to @xmath78 for our case we have @xmath79 .",
    "after measurement , alice broadcasts her measurement outcome to bob and charlie via a classical channel .    next",
    ", our concern is moved to the subsystem of bob and charlie .",
    "this process can be performed by tracing out the alice s subsystem , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath80 after then , the accomplice , bob , performs a projective measurement again by preparing a set of measurement operators @xmath81 with @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 form a basis for the bob s qubit , the completeness condition @xmath85 is naturally satisfied . from the quantum mechanical postulates again the probability @xmath86 , probability",
    "that the result of the bob s measurement is @xmath87 on condition that the outcome of alice s measurement is @xmath76 , reduces to @xmath88\\ ] ] and the state of the system after the bob s measurement becomes @xmath89 for our case @xmath86 becomes @xmath90    after then , our concern is moved to the subsystem of charlie by tracing out the bob s subsystem , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath91 finally , charlie takes an appropriate unitary transformation to his own qubit @xmath92 the unitary operator @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is usual pauli matrices . at this stage",
    "the tripartite teleportation process is terminated .",
    "now , we want to discuss the tripartite teleportation process through a noisy channel .",
    "if noise is introduced at the initial stage when alice , bob , and charlie share their each single qubit of @xmath54 , @xmath67 is , in general , changed into the mixed state .",
    "the mixed state can be derived by solving a master equation in the lindblad form@xcite @xmath96 + \\sum_{i , \\alpha } \\left(l_{i,\\alpha } \\rho l_{i,\\alpha}^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2 }",

    "solutions of eq.([lindblad ] ) for the @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and isotropy noises were solved explicitly in ref.@xcite .",

    "in this section we would like to discuss the three - tangles for the various noisy channels expressed in eq.([summary1 ] ) .",

    "this fact is shown in appendix a.    now , let us consider a pure state @xmath145 where @xmath146 . then it is easy to show that the three - tangle of @xmath147 becomes @xmath148    the vectors @xmath149 has following properties .",

    "since eq.([tangle - x-4 ] ) is an optimal decomposition at @xmath162 , one can conjecture that it is also optimal in the region @xmath163 . as will be shown",
    "shortly , however , this is not true at the large-@xmath164 region .",
    "if we compute the three - tangle under the condition that eq.([tangle - x-4 ] ) is optimal at @xmath163 , its expression becomes @xmath165 however , one can show straightforwardly that @xmath166 is not a convex function in the region @xmath167 , where @xmath168 therefore , we need to convexify @xmath166 in the region @xmath169 to make the three - tangle to be convex function , where @xmath170 is some number between @xmath171 and @xmath172 . the number @xmath170 will be determined shortly .    in the large @xmath164-region",
