    "any two heegaard splittings of the same @xmath1-manifold have a common stabilization @xcite , @xcite .",
    "that is to say , there is a third heegaard splitting which is isotopic to a stabilization of each of the initial splittings .",
    "the _ stable genus _ of two heegaard splittings is the minimal genus of their common stabilizations .",
    "it had been conjectured that the stable genus of any two heegaard splittings is at most @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the larger of the two initial genera , which is called _ the stabilization conjecture_. this conjecture has been verified for many classes of @xmath1-manifolds , including seifert fibered spaces @xcite , most genus - two @xmath1-manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and most graph manifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "johnson @xcite gave a counterexample for this conjecture .",
    "for each @xmath0 , he constructed an irreducible toroidal @xmath1-manifold with heegaard splittings of genera @xmath3 and @xmath2 such that the stable genus of these two splittings is @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , we can see that the stable genus is at most @xmath4 by a simple observation , and the point is the bounding from below .",
    "his construction can be easily modified to produce an atoroidal @xmath1-manifold with heegaard splittings of genera @xmath18 and @xmath2 whose stable genus is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is larger than @xmath21 .",
    "however , the larger @xmath20 is , the closer the stable genus is to the genus of the original . if @xmath20 is larger than @xmath22 , it does not give a counterexample for the conjecture .",
    "we modify his construction to the opposite direction and refine the bounding for the stable genus from bellow as the following :    [ main ] for every @xmath0 , there exists a @xmath1-manifold with two heegaard splittings of genus @xmath2 whose stable genus is @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath1-manifold is reducible . actually , we get it by taking connected sum of two closed @xmath1-manifolds with heegaard splittings of genus @xmath23 with high hempel distance ( see section [ splittings ] )",
    ". it may be a strong point of this paper that we can construct a counterexample for the stabilization conjecture from genus - two @xmath1-manifolds by substituting @xmath24 for @xmath23 .",
    "there are fairly many studies on genus - two @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "for instance , kobayashi @xcite gave a complete list of genus - two @xmath1-manifolds admitting nontrivial torus decompositions .",
    "prior to johnson @xcite , a counterexample for the  oriented version \" of the stabilization conjecture was given by hass , thompson and thurston @xcite .",
    "in the  oriented version \" , two heegaard splittings are called isotopic only if the isotopy preserves the order of the handlebodies . for a heegaard splitting , the minimal genus of its stabilizations where the handlebodies can be interchanged by an isotopy is called the _",
    "flip genus_. they showed that there is a heegaard splitting whose flip genus is twice the initial genus .",
    "for the oriented version , johnson @xcite gave an estimate for general heegaard splittings .",
    "he showed that the flip genus of any heegaard splitting of genus @xmath23 with hempel distance @xmath25 is at least @xmath26 .",
    "his counterexample in @xcite and ours for the non - oriented version can be viewed as applications of this estimation .",
    "bachman @xcite also gave several counterexamples using different techniques .",
    "one is for the oriented version , and another is for the non - oriented version .",

    "i would also like to thank jesse johnson for helpful comments .",
    "to begin with , we will define heegaard splittings for compact @xmath1-manifolds possibly with boundaries . a _ compression body _ is a connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath27 which can be obtained from @xmath28 $ ] by attaching finitely many @xmath21-handles to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a closed , orientable , possibly disconnected surface .",
