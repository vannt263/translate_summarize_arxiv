    "neutron stars are highly compact stars of typical radius @xmath2 km and mass @xmath3 made mostly of degenerate neutron - rich matter at densities up to several times nuclear matter saturation density @xmath4 g / cc . by tracking their long - term thermal and rotational evolution",
    ", we can learn about the nature of matter under the crust .",
    "for example , @xcite have proposed that the thermal history of the neutron star in cas a may be indicating the recent onset of neutron superfluidity deep in its interior .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown how rotational evolution is linked to a reorganization of particle composition in the stellar interior , leading to switching on of exotic neutrino emission processes .",
    "a neutron star is a complex system with intertwined physical properties that can change on relatively short astrophysical timescales .    in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned with the rotational evolution of a highly magnetized isolated neutron star .",
    "the electromagnetic emissions of a neutron star derive from its rotational kinetic energy , and its spindown is usually measured in terms of a braking index , @xmath5 , which is dependent on the magnetic field configuration ( @xmath5=3 for a dipolar field ) .",
    "neutron stars can also spindown through gravitational wave emissions associated to the r - mode @xcite .",
    "in fact , the observational interest in r - modes comes from the fact that no neutron stars have been found to spin at rates near the maximum allowed frequency ( the `` break - up frequency '' ) .",
    "r - modes offer a possible explanation of this fact : in rotating neutron stars , these modes lose energy through gravitational waves , which carry away angular momentum from the star and act as braking radiation . as the star spins down , its central density increases .",
    "this increase could be sufficient to make baryonic matter undergo phase transitions to more exotic phases of strongly interacting matter , such as quark matter , with possible implications for gamma - ray bursts @xcite and the formation of quark stars , if theoretical conjectures about the absolute stability of strange quark matter are realized in nature @xcite . while it is almost certain that this quark phase , if it exists inside neutron stars , can not be a free gas of quarks @xcite , an interacting phase of quarks still appears to be consistent with the recent finding of a 2@xmath6 neutron star @xcite .",
    "the main questions we seek to answer are : given a few initial parameters of the newly born neutron star , such as its spin period , magnetic field and baryonic mass , can we determine which neutron stars are likely to eventually manifest a quark phase in their interior ?",
    "if so , how long before the transition to quark matter occurs ? in this work , we take a step towards answering these questions by taking a closer look at the rotational evolution of a newly - born hot neutron star as it spins down , and we focus on two main driving factors - magnetic braking and gravitational radiation from r - modes .",
    "we consider different equations of state ( eos ) for neutron stars , since the eos at high density is uncertain and lacking strong empirical constraints ( although a recent statistical analysis shows that the equation of state stiffens at high densities and is consistent with the expected range in certain nuclear parameters ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , second generation gravitational wave detectors such as advanced ligo will soon be operational , and our work provides an update for a similar theoretical study @xcite performed several years ago with regard to the ligo detector .",
    "we should note here that in contrast to the assumptions in @xcite , our work includes the effects of magnetic damping of r - modes in the spindown evolution , which leads to quantitatively different results .    in section [ theorymag ] , we outline the approach and main equations that describe the neutron star s spindown .",
    "the theoretical analysis follows in part the works of @xcite , as well as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section [ magresults ] collects our main conclusions from this analysis . in section [ gwevo ]",
    ", we analyze the evolution of the gravitational wave frequency associated to the growing r - mode , along the lines of @xcite , and present results in section [ gwresults ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclude ] with a preliminary calculation of the gravitational wave signal from an explosive deconfinement transition ( the  quark - nova \" ) .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite , we had determined birth parameters of a neutron star which would support the transition to deconfinement driven solely by magnetic braking .",
    "we found that neutron stars that are born with mass @xmath7 and spin - period @xmath8 ms are the best candidates to reach deconfinement density in their core ( assumed to be @xmath9 ) , given a range of neutron star magnetic fields @xmath10-@xmath11 gauss .",
    "this small value of the initial spin - period ( or large spin frequency ) is required since magnetic braking from a rotating magnetic dipole is itself proportional to the third power of the spin frequency .",
    "most of the increase in central density occurs soon after the rapidly rotating neutron star is born .    in that work",
    ", we neglected the role of gravitational radiation from r - modes in an adhoc way - by assuming that neutrons stars are born axisymmetric and remain so . in reality , non - axisymmetric perturbations are expected due to the violent process of a supernova , which leaves the new - born neutron star in a turbulent state @xcite .",
    "what is then the role of r - modes and gravitational braking in comparison to magnetic braking as far as the time to deconfinement is concerned ?",
    "previous studies on the interplay of r - modes and neutron star magnetic fields have focused on different questions - for example , @xcite has studied the r - mode in magnetized neutron stars with @xmath12 g with an aim to understand x - ray pulsations from local hot spots in accretion - powered pulsars . @xcite",
    "have shown that magnetic fields of @xmath13 g can make magnetic braking as important as r - mode spindown , specially for slowly rotating stars , and that alfvn wave driving of the r - mode can also play a role .",
    "0.2 cm    meanwhile , other works @xcite have focused on the evolution of toroidal magnetic fields generated by the secular r - mode .",
    "essentially , the toroidal field is generated by differential rotation of the stellar fluid associated with the r - mode .",
    "the differential rotation is a key feature of the r - mode instability in the non - linear regime @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that , for isolated neutron stars , this effect can amplify existing magnetic fields by two orders of magnitude within the time taken by the r - mode to saturate ( @xmath14 few hundred secs . ) .",
    "back - reaction on the r - mode due to this toroidal field implies that there is an associated magnetic damping , which has to be factored into the spin evolution . for neutron stars that are accreting from a binary companion ,",
    "the build - up of toroidal fields to sizeable values is rather slow , and according to @xcite , can take up to several hundred years .",
    "however , we are interested in this effect on isolated neutron stars .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic damping term @xmath15 is proportional to the integrated time evolution of @xmath16 @xcite , with @xmath17 being the r - mode amplitude .",
    "these authors obtained a strong damping effect by assuming that the background evolution of @xmath18 is identical to that given by the absence of any magnetic fields .",
    "however , we solve the evolution equations for the star s angular frequency @xmath19 and @xmath18 with magnetic fields and magnetic damping from the start .",
    "@xmath15 grows while the mode is unstable , and once it saturates @xmath15 remains constant .",
    "this consistent inclusion of @xmath15 leads to a slower evolutionary path for @xmath18 towards saturation , hence the magnetic damping is not as effective in suppressing the r - mode .",
    "consequently , for a range of magnetic fields and small r - mode saturation values , we find that this timescale can be much larger than the typical time taken by the neutron star to spindown to typical quark deconfinement density .",
    "therefore , our results clearly indicate that the r - mode , for realistic saturation values , quantitatively affects the spindown evolution of an isolated neutron star .",
    "we now discuss the relevant equations for the evolution of the star s rotation rate and r - mode evolution .",
    "the spindown @xmath20 of a neutron star ( mass @xmath21 , radius @xmath22 ) is accompanied by a loss of energy as well as angular momentum . for the radiating star , conservation of total angular momentum @xmath23 with @xmath24 a dimensionless constant and @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the moment of inertia about the rotation axis ) yields @xcite    @xmath27    @xmath28 is the canonical angular momentum of the r - mode to 1st order in @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 is the rate of gravitational radiation associated to the @xmath30=@xmath31=2 current multipole taken for an @xmath5=1 polytropic star from eqn.(65 ) of @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be a good approximation to a large part of the neutron star interior .",
    "@xmath32 is the accretion rate onto the star ( assumed zero for our case since we consider isolated stars only ) and @xmath33 is the magnetic braking rate @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath34 is defined from    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the density profile ( assumed radially symmetric ) of the star   significantly , which is the basis for our approximation of a symmetric profile . ] .",
    "@xmath37 evolves in time as a result of competing influences from gravitational damping ( which feeds the r - mode ) , viscosity ( which damps the r - mode ) and the magnetic damping term @xmath15 .",
    "both bulk and shear viscosities are included in our analysis although for simplicity we keep the star at a uniform temperature of @xmath38k for the duration of the evolution .",
    "although viscosities ( especially bulk viscosity ) is strongly temperature - dependent , our approximation is not as drastic as it may seem .",
    "a typical cooling profile of a neutron star , driven by neutrino emission from the modified urca process is given by @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the star s core temperature @xmath41 in units of @xmath38k , @xmath42 the initial temperature , and @xmath43 yr is the characteristic cooling time from the modified urca process .",
    "if we begin with birth temperatures @xmath44k , we see that within a few seconds , we have @xmath45k . since the r - mode does not have a large impact until @xmath46 seconds , we can approximate @xmath47 .",
    "subsequent cooling is on the timescale of years and is also a small perturbation on our results . using the evolution equation for @xmath37 ,",

    "we solve the two coupled equations above numerically .",
    "we use the rns code @xcite to construct 2-dimensional models of rapidly rotating neutron stars . for a given eos and for a fixed baryonic mass",
    ", the rns code outputs a sequence of neutron star models ( with specific gravitational mass , radius , spin frequency etc . )",
    "that have increasing central density and decreasing angular velocity .",
    "the fastest model in such a sequence spins at or near kepler frequency . note that the magnetic field does not appear in the rns code , and in any case , its effect on structure at the field values considered here is negligible .",
    "the magnetic field only determines the time to deconfinement , unless the spindown is completely r - mode dominated . as in @xcite",
    "we assume @xmath50 to be a critical density at which quarks in the interior of the neutron star become deconfined - this is not a well determined number , and may span a range from ( 4 - 8)@xmath51 if a mixed phase of quark and nuclear matter is favored @xcite . to counter this uncertainty ,",
    "we have checked our numerical results for a higher putative deconfinement density ( @xmath52 ) and found that it does not change any of our quantitative conclusions by a significant amount .    using the rns code",
    ", we construct sequences of stars ( for a given eos ) with constant baryonic mass and decreasing spin such that the non - rotating configuration has a central density equal to @xmath50 .",
    "we then calculate the time the rotating star takes until its central density is within @xmath53 of @xmath50 .",
    "this is a practical way of using eqn.([spinevo ] ) to obtain the minimum mass required ( for a given eos ) to support deconfinement , since the time taken to reach zero spin is infinite from the magnetic braking being proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "since we are interested in the time it takes for a star to spindown to the critical density for deconfinement , by choosing a sequence where the non - rotating model has a central density equal to the critical density , this time gives us the maximum time the star takes to reach the deconfinement density .",
    "we assume a very small initial amplitude of the r - mode for the fastest spinning star in a sequence , with typical initial @xmath54 , although our results for those cases where the r - mode saturates are insensitive to this initial value .",
    "for the case when the mode does not saturate , we do find mild sensitivity to the initial value of @xmath17 .",
    "from the first of eqn.([spinevo ] ) , we can calculate the time - step between two consecutive neutron star models in the spin - sequence output by rns code @xmath55 - \\omega(t_i ) f_{\\rm mag } } \\,\\,.\\ ] ]    the inverse dependence on @xmath17 implies that for small magnetic fields , where @xmath33 is small , @xmath56 is large when the mode amplitude is just starting to grow .",
    "the rns code then needs to generate two widely separated rotating configurations within a sequence , leading to low resolution in some parts of the @xmath57 vs @xmath58 curves for small magnetic fields ( eg . , the curve for @xmath59=@xmath10 g in fig.[pvst ] ) .",
    "however , this is only a problem initially and does not affect the total time to deconfinement .",
    "the above equation , along with the second of eqn.([spinevo ] ) is then used to determine the time evolution of @xmath17 . for our analysis",
    "we have used four different magnetic field strengths equally spaced on a logarithmic scale from @xmath10 g to @xmath11 g. we display results for three different equations of state : eos a which is composed of only neutrons@xcite and uses a variational principle to determine the minimum energy state ; eos bbb2 which includes muons and uses a field - theoretic many - body approach @xcite ; and finally eos apr which is relatively stiff and admits a mixed phase of quarks and nuclear matter for the heaviest stars @xcite .",
    "all three eos generate stable configurations for central densities exceeding 5@xmath51 and can go up to even @xmath60 .",
    "they differ in the details of the density profile , with the softest ( eos a ) having higher interior densities for the same mass ( more compact ) .",
    "the maximum gravitational mass exceeds @xmath61 only for the apr eos @xcite , with bbb2 providing a maximum mass of 1.92@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "eos a is too soft to generate a 2@xmath6 neutron star and may seem inadequate to explain recent observations of such massive compact stars @xcite .",
    "however , if such massive stars are really quark or hybrid stars , we can not rule out eos a in this way , and its inclusion is still useful simply to examine the trend of a relatively soft eos on the gravitational signal from r - mode driven spindown .",
    "the following results are obtained on solving eqns.(4 ) numerically . in fig .",
    "[ pvst ] , the curves show how the period , starting from the kepler rotation rate at birth , evolves as a function of magnetic field strength , for different equations of state .",
    "note that these curves correspond to structural parameters of that _ particular _ stellar configuration which _ just _ reaches the putative quark deconfinement density at zero angular velocity - we may call this the _",
    "critical configuration_. for any given eos , this is how we determine the minimum mass and spin period required for a quark phase to appear as a result of spindown . unlike fig . 4 of @xcite , spindown",
    "is no longer always magnetic - dominated for arbitrary magnetic fields .",
    "for example , for @xmath62 g , r - mode spindown takes over at a few hundred seconds .",
    "as the instability develops , magnetic damping @xmath15 grows and limits the growth of the r - mode .",
    "this leads to a plateau in the period that can last up to several years before magnetic damping once again becomes the dominant driver of spindown .",
    "it is noteworthy that for the critical configuration , there is no change in the time to deconfinement for any value of @xmath59 .",
    "however , if we choose a heavier mass at birth , the time to deconfinement would be shorter , and can occur while the star is still being spun down as a result of the r - mode . assuming that even the most massive neutron stars can be transformed to stable quark stars",
    "if they reach the deconfinement density ( that is , the quark matter eos should be sufficiently stiff to support such a mass ) , we may expect that several such neutron stars would have already spun down to the point where they underwent a quark - hadron phase transition , and now contain quark matter in their core .",
    "our findings here are different from the conclusions of @xcite who studied the r - mode of magnetized and slowly rotating neutron stars , and found that the r - mode alters the spindown if magnetic fields are less than @xmath63 g . due to the inclusion of the magnetic damping term , which was omitted in their work",
    ", we find that r - mode driven effects on spindown are pronounced only for @xmath62 g , since for higher @xmath59 fields , magnetic damping effectively kills the r - mode .",
    "we emphasize that the effects of magnetic damping for smaller @xmath59 fields are not as severe as might be expected from the work of @xcite due to the self - consistent evolution of @xmath17 in the presence of the magnetic damping term , as explained at the beginning of section [ theorymag ] .",
    "we also find that the r - mode driven spindown is more pronounced in a relatively stiff equation of state such as eos apr .",
    "this is because @xmath29 , the gravitational damping rate is larger for a stiffer eos   and for stars with the same baryonic mass and central density at zero angular frequency , this quantity is systematically larger for a stiffer eos . in other words , for a given baryonic mass , a stiffer eos can support a larger gravitational mass and radius , and has a slightly smaller kepler frequency since its average density is smaller ( less compact ) . for eg .",
    ", @xmath64 6 . ] , driving the r - mode unstable in a shorter amount of time ( effectively spinning the star down to deconfinement density quickly ) .",
    "the saturation amplitude @xmath1 of the r - mode assumed in the foregoing analysis is @xmath65 .",
    "such a large value is probably unrealistic due to multi - mode coupling and onset of non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "if we use a smaller saturation value , we find that our conclusions change quantitatively .",
    "the r - mode grows more slowly for a smaller @xmath1 , but continues to be important since the main damping agent @xmath15 , which is roughly proportional to @xmath66 , is also smaller . as a consequence ,",
    "the spindown due to the r - mode is weaker , but also lasts longer , as seen in fig.[pvst0.01 ] .",
    "this can lead to the star taking a shorter time to reach a given period in the case of smaller @xmath59 fields .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig.[pvslogalpha005 ] which compares the time taken by the star to spindown to a period @xmath57=3 ms , for @xmath1=0.01 and @xmath1=0.005 .",
    "as shown in the previous section , fairly large magnetic fields of @xmath67 g or more are required to make the r - mode irrelevant for spindown . for smaller magnetic fields",
    ", the r - mode evolution can be the main agent for spinning down rapidly rotating stars .",
    "following @xcite , we can obtain expressions for the growth of the mode amplitude ( @xmath17 ) and the corresponding evolution of the frequency of the gravitational wave ( @xmath68 ) under certain approximations .",
    "the r - mode amplitude grows rapidly until non - linear saturation occurs @xcite at which point @xmath69=0 .",
    "we can obtain a description of this saturated phase from eqns.([spinevo ] ) , which imply that the rotation rate evolves according to @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the saturation amplitude of the r - mode .",
    "note that @xmath15 does not appear since it can be eliminated using the second line of eqns.(4 ) .",
    "its effect will however show up in the growth phase discussed below .",
    "using the fact that @xmath72 for the @xmath73 r - mode , setting @xmath74 ( a typical value determined from eqn.([iandjbar ] ) ) , and using the frequency - dependent expression for the gravitational wave damping timescale @xmath75 , we find    @xmath76    where we have used the expression for @xmath77 from @xcite and neglected @xmath78 in the denominator of eqn.([sateqn ] ) . @xmath79 and @xmath26 are expressed in terms of reduced dimensionless units .",
    "0.5 cm      in the initial stages of the mode growth phase , the viscosity controls the evolution of the r - mode , but the instability to gravitational waves soon takes over .",
    "viscous damping from bulk viscosity can be large at @xmath80k , but as the neutron star cools rapidly on the order of seconds , our approximation of setting @xmath81 implies that viscosity does not affect the subsequent spindown behaviour or the gravitational waveform during the growth of the r - mode instability .",
    "it follows from eqns.([spinevo ] ) that during this phase , since @xmath17 is small    @xmath82    the angular velocity evolves according to the first line of eqns.(4 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath83 for the growth phase , which is tantamount to including fully the canonical angular momentum of the r - mode in the star s physical angular momentum .",
    "this is only justified if differential rotation is small @xcite , as is the case when the mode is still small but growing .",
    "then , as before , the proportionality between @xmath68 and @xmath19 implies    @xmath84    where we have used the expression for @xmath15 from eqn.(11 ) of @xcite .",
    "we can now use eqns.([ftsat ] ) and ( [ ftgrow ] ) to obtain the gravitational strain amplitudes and waveforms for the saturated phase and growth phase respectively .",
    "the strain amplitude @xmath85 corresponding to the @xmath30=@xmath31=2 mode is found by a standard multipole analysis @xcite .",

    "figure [ gwvst ] shows the time - evolution of the strain amplitude @xmath85 for various magnetic fields and for different eos for @xmath90 , while fig .",
    "[ gwvst0.01 ] shows this for @xmath91 . for magnetic fields @xmath13 g ,",

    "g , we notice a strong dependence on the equation of state .",
    "the soft eos a does not lead to a saturating r - mode while relatively stiffer eos do . for weaker magnetic fields around @xmath93 g , the r - mode saturates and displays the behaviour shown in fig .",

    "previous works @xcite indicate that the saturation amplitude @xmath1 may be quite small , around @xmath98 instead of order 1 .",

    "the einstein telescope is expected to gain about an order of magnitude in sensitivity compared to advanced ligo , and hence all of the above cases should be detectable in principle .",
    "our snr estimates only provide upper limits since matched filtering is probably impractical for such sources , where spin parameters can not be promptly measured , though the source location could be known if the supernova is observed .",

    "observations of the neutron star s spindown parameters may then be possible , making the matched filtering method more feasible . in the context of r - modes in newly - born neutron stars , methods other than matched filtering",
    "have been suggested  @xcite that would be less computationally intensive .      as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the sharp spike in the strain amplitude seen in certain cases only lasts for a brief period of time ( of the order of a minute ) and carries a small fraction of the total energy emitted in gravitational waves over the spindown epoch ( see fig .",
    "[ gwvst ] ) .",

    "[ htilde ] and [ htilde0.01 ] that @xmath111 remains relatively independent of @xmath1 , although both the @xmath112 g and @xmath113 g cases shows a flat segment corresponding to the saturated phase for @xmath91 . essentially , this is because the decrease in the peak value of @xmath85 for smaller @xmath1 is compensated by the corresponding decrease in @xmath114 ( eg .",
    ", as in eqn.([ftsat ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that we require a larger interval of time integration to validate the stationary phase approximation for a smaller @xmath1 ( eqn .",

    "we have studied the role of r - modes in spinning a rapidly rotating and magnetized neutron star down to typical quark deconfinement densities .",
    "apart from the usual spindown associated to magnetic braking , the magnetic damping of r - modes plays an important role in the period evolution of the star .",
    "we find that , for realistic ( small ) values of the r - mode saturation amplitude @xmath1 , the time to deconfinement is sped up by the r - mode instability when magnetic fields are of order @xmath10 g or less .",
    "this result reflects the strong dependence of the magnetic damping effect on @xmath59 and the evolution of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the result in @xcite , where the r - mode was seen to affect the spindown already for magnetic fields less than @xmath63 g , the inclusion of the magnetic damping term leads us to conclude that r - mode driven effects on spindown are pronounced only for @xmath62 g .",
    "we also explored the gravitational wave signal generated during the spindown phase as the r - mode first grows then saturates - we follow the signal continuously until the quark deconfinement threshold is reached . for realistic values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the r - mode saturates and leads to a strong signal in gravitational waves , except in case of very soft equations of state and very large magnetic field ( @xmath11 g or more ) .",
    "there could be a sizeable fraction of the total rotational kinetic energy emitted as gravitational waves in this epoch , which can last several years , making it detectable in upcoming second and third generation detectors .",
    "therefore , gravitational waves could be used in this manner to probe the equation of state inside neutron stars . as shown here , using r - modes",
    "is an alternate way in which the eos can be probed through gravitational waves     gravitational waves are going to open a new window of observation into our universe . among the many discoveries that will be made , we anticipate the exciting prospect that neutron star spindown will reveal signs of the elusive r - mode instability as well as signatures for the onset of quark matter in the core . in the appendix",
    "we outline a first preliminary estimate of what the gravitational wave signal from a `` quark - nova '' would look like .",
    "it would be interesting to examine this signal with detailed simulations , especially in cases when the quark - nova occurs very shortly after the neutron star is born in a supernova - the signature of this `` dual - explosion '' in gravitational wave detectors would be two very different signals coming from the same source but separated in time by a few days to few weeks , depending on the time delay between the two explosions .",
    "such a signature would be unmistakeable in upcoming gravitational wave detectors .    it remains an open question as to what happens to the neutron star when the deconfinement density is reached .",
    "one possibility is that the entire star is converted to a quark star due to the inherent stability of strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "if this conversion occurs in an explosive manner , a``quark - nova '' could result @xcite - what will the gravitational signal from such an event look like ?",
    "the conversion involves a two - stage process - neutrons in the core dissolve into a @xmath115 and @xmath116 quark fluid that is more compact , causing the core to shrink , followed by combustion to @xmath117 quarks through leptonic as well as non - leptonic processes .",
    "@xcite have studied the first stage with newtonian hydrodynamics and found that quadrupolar and quasi - radial modes are excited during the collapse , leading to gravitational wave emission with an energy output of  @xmath118 ergs . however",
    ", this work applies to a mixed phase of quarks and nuclear matter and does not consider an explosive transition that begins with non - premixed fluids .    0.2 cm    a full numerical treatment of the second stage , an explosive phase transition taking into account fluid motion in 3d is a complex task and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , preliminary steps have been taken in this direction .",
    "@xcite solved hydrodynamical flow equations for the combustion of neutron matter to strange quark matter in the laminar approximation , including weak equilibrating reactions and strange quark diffusion across the burning front .",
    "the numerical results suggest laminar speeds of @xmath119 times the speed of light , much faster than previous estimates derived using only a reactive - diffusive description  @xcite .",
    "turbulent combustion has been addressed in a recent work by @xcite who found that the combustion stops short of converting the entire star to quark matter ( the reaction is no longer exothermic ) .",
    "this was also the conclusion in @xcite , though for a different physical reason  .",
    "neither of these works continue on to estimate the gravitational signal from the explosive combustion . following the hydrodynamical approach of these studies ,",
    "we have estimated the gravitational wave signal @xmath85 from the following steps .    * starting from a mechanically stable configuration where quark matter constitutes a small fraction of the stellar core , we initiate combustion at the speeds obtained in @xcite .",
    "the quark fluid , described by a simple bag model equation of state is subsequently evolved using inviscid hydrodynamical equations for relativistic fluid flow ( relativistic euler equations ) coupled with newtonian gravity  , assuming an axisymmetric rotating configuration of the star about the @xmath120-axis . in",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the polar angle and @xmath123 is the azimuthal angle , the relevant equations are given by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are introduced solely for the purpose of writing the relativistic euler equations in a form analagous to the more familiar non - relativistic euler equations . in the natural units where",
    "@xmath129 , the fluid velocity , lorentz factor , gravitational vector field , and specific enthalpy are respectively given by @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the specific internal energy , @xmath135 is the pressure , and @xmath122 is the gravitational potential . in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath136 ) , we recover the non - relativistic euler equations . *",
    "the quark matter has a density @xmath137 and is described by the bag model ( bag constant @xmath138 mev ) while the nuclear fluid has density @xmath139 and is described by the perfect caloric eos with an adiabatic index of @xmath140 . at @xmath58=0 , we initiate combustion with a density discontinuity @xmath141 , which is situated at a radial coordinate @xmath142 inside the star , and choose an initial burning front speed of @xmath143=0.01@xmath144 , which is in the range of burn velocities obtained in @xcite .",
    "we then evolve the above equations using a weighted average flux relativistic hll ( harten , lax , and van leer ) solver on a cartesian grid with spatial resolution 0.5 km and a timestep determined by a courant number of @xmath145 .",
    "the solver is coupled with the poisson equation @xmath146 . * solving for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , we follow @xcite to compute the quadrupole wave amplitude @xmath149 for our axisymmetric configuration , and from there the signal @xmath85 as given by eqn.(21 ) of @xcite . + @xmath150 + we assume a source distance @xmath151 mpc to plot the maximal signal strength @xmath85 and the corresponding luminosity @xmath152 in fig.[qn - signal ] . the origin of the peak in @xmath85 is a balance between increasing mass outflow and a decreasing density gradient .",
    "the luminosity is proportional to the square of @xmath153 ( hence the sharp dip at the maximum of @xmath85 ) while the total emitted energy obtained from integrating the luminosity curve is @xmath154 ergs , which is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the binding energy of the neutron star ( @xmath155 ergs ) and 2 orders of magnitude less than the energy released in gravitational waves during the first stage of core - collapse , where the energy comes from coupling oscillations to rotational motion  @xcite .",
    "based on this result , the gravitational wave signal for this stage of the phase conversion would be hard to detect in advanced ligo , unless the source is galactic ( within few kpc ) . most of the energy released in the phase transition is in the form of latent heat and neutrinos .",
    "however , our results are only a preliminary estimate , designed to provide a guide to the expected signal from a quark - nova . simulations of gravitational wave signals from realistic core - collapse supernova models indicate that convective flows driven by neutrino heating @xcite can drive a strong gravitational wave signal .",
    "the typical time for neutrinos to diffuse out of the hot quark star ( @xmath14 0.1 - 1 sec according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is about an order of magnitude larger than the duration of the signal due to explosive combustion to strange quark matter , therefore , we can expect neutrino heating to be important in our context as well .",
    "we have not included such convective effects in our present simulation , nor the effect of magnetic fields , which can also modify rayleigh - taylor instabilities  @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee who pointed out the importance of magnetic damping on the r - modes .",
