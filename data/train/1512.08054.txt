    "the energy of the physical processes is very high , there is no firm knowledge of the physics of particles and fields during inflation .",

    "we have obtained the explicit form of several power - law type potentials , which could be relevant for the study of the inflationary epoch . in order to evaluate the cosmologically relevant parameters during inflation , the time evolution of the scalar field can be expressed in terms of the e - fold number @xmath296 , given by @xmath297 , where @xmath298 is the value of the scale factor at the end of the inflation .",
    "@xmath296 is related to the scalar field potential by the relation @xmath299d\\phi}$ ] @xcite . hence ,",
    "if an inflationary potential is given , one can find first find @xmath300 .",
    "once @xmath300 is known , one can immediately obtain another important cosmological parameters , like the scalar spectral index , and the tensor to - scalar ratio , respectively .",
    "therefore , once these parameters have been computed , one can compare the predictions of the inflationary potentials obtained via noether symmetry with the planck 2015 results .",
    "such a comparison may also fix the numerical values of the parameters ( constants of integration ) of the noether potentials .",
    "hence for all inflationary type noether models non trivial constraints on the parameters can be obtained from the cmb data .    to conclude , in the present paper we have presented some theoretical tools that could help in the mathematical analysis of the scalar - tensor theories , and in the investigation of their cosmological implications .",
