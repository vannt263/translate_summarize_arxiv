    "<S> for the single truncation case in a @xmath4-order icosahedron , there are @xmath15 single possible truncations ; the shape for any @xmath9st - i@xmath2@xmath6 is a decmon pyramid on one side and a pentagonal one in the opposite vertex .   </S>",

    "<S> but we can also vary ( @xmath18 ) as a function of the number of atoms ( n ) .   keeping @xmath7 constant in all the size range </S>",
    "<S> , it should be observed that the first truncation ( @xmath20 , blue triangles ) made to all the cluster sizes , begins with a positive high slope in the small - size region . </S>",
    "<S> after a given cluster size ( around @xmath21 nm ) , this truncation improves their stability significantly making it even more stable than the icosahedra near @xmath22 nm ( @xmath23 atoms ) .  </S>",
    "<S> this change in the curvature is size dependent and is only observed up to the truncation @xmath24 ( not shown ) .   </S>",
    "<S> after that , successive truncations only increase monotonically the energy stability of the @xmath9st - i@xmath2 .   </S>",
    "<S> this abrupt change in the curvature of the stability has been identified as a surface reconstruction in the st - i@xmath2  @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 , with @xmath26 atoms , and a particle diameter of @xmath27 the indexes ( @xmath18 ) would be changing ( keeping the relation @xmath28 ) and what is obtained is a transformation path from the m - i@xmath2 to the s - d@xmath2 symmetry structures ( green @xmath29 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> if truncations are made until they are exhausted , an irregular decahedron is obtained , which after relaxation turns into either a _ structure with the same energy for a perfect decahedra _ ( here shown the complete s - d@xmath2 family with red circles ) , or a _ surface reconstructed _ decahedra , _ </S>",
