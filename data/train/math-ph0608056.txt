    "_ continuous time tasep . _",
    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is one of the simplest interacting stochastic particle systems .",
    "its particles are on the lattice of integers , @xmath0 , with at most one particle at each site ( exclusion principle ) .",
    "the dynamics of the tasep is defined as follows .",
    "particles jump on the neighboring right site with rate @xmath1 provided that the site is empty .",
    "this means that jumps are independent of each other and take place after an exponential waiting time with mean @xmath1 , which is counted from the time instant when the right neighbor site is empty .    on the macroscopic level the particle density , @xmath2 , evolves deterministically according to the burgers equation @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore a natural question is to focus on fluctuation properties and on large deviations , which exhibit rather unexpected features .",
    "the fluctuations of the integrated particle current and in the positions of particles are two faces of the same coin as to be discussed later .",
    "the fluctuations of particle positions are sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "for example , one can consider particles initially positioned every second site , i.e. , on @xmath4 .",
    "another possibility would be to consider the stationary measure of the same density as initial condition , which is bernoulli with density @xmath5 .",
    "the scaling exponents for particle positions fluctuations are the same for the two initial conditions .",
    "however , the limiting distribution differ : as we will see , in the first case it is the goe tracy - widom of random matrices  @xcite which differs from the stationary case  @xcite .",
    "thus it is of interest to understand which class of initial conditions leads to the same limit distribution .",
    "the first result in this direction has been obtained for the step initial condition . to be precise ,",
    "denote by @xmath6 the position of particle @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , where the @xmath7 s are integers labelling the particles from right to left .",
    "the step initial condition is then @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "it has been studied by johansson  @xcite by means of a growth model . in terms of the tasep ,",
    "the quantity analyzed is the large time asymptotic fluctuations of the position of a given particle . for any fixed @xmath11 , the fluctuation of @xmath12}(t)$ ]",
    "are asymptotically governed by the gue tracy - widom distribution , @xmath13 , namely there are some @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath16}(t)\\leq v(\\alpha ) t+s \\ , b(\\alpha ) t^{1/3})=f_2(s).\\ ] ] the distribution @xmath13 first appeared in the context of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of random matrices as the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in the limit of large matrix dimension  @xcite .",
    "a natural question is to ask how the positions of different particles are correlated , i.e. , one considers for fixed but large time @xmath8 the process @xmath17 . to illustrate known results we focus at @xmath18 , but",
    "the same holds with different numerical coefficients for @xmath19 , @xmath11   because then the term linear in @xmath8 disappears in ( [ eq1.2 ] ) , ( [ eq : sas1 ] ) , and ( [ eqrescaling ] ) . ] .",
    "( [ eq : joh1 ] ) tells us that the fluctuations live on a @xmath20 scale and it turns out that the position of two particles are , on the @xmath20 scale , non - trivially correlated over a distance of order @xmath21 . the exponents @xmath22 and @xmath23 are indeed the ones of the kpz universality class  @xcite , to which the tasep belongs . indeed , johansson  @xcite proves a functional limit theorem in a discrete - time setting .",
    "its continuous - time version writes @xmath24}(t)-(-2u(t/2)^{2/3}+u^2(t/2)^{1/3})}{-(t/2)^{1/3}}={{\\cal a}_{\\rm 2}}(u)\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is known as the airy process , first discovered in the png model under droplet growth  @xcite .    besides the step initial condition explained above",
    ", at least two other situations are of particular interest .",
    "one is the _ stationary _ initial condition , for which the two - point function of the tasep is analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the second one has _",
    "deterministic _ initial conditions leading to a macroscopically uniform density , thus called _ flat _ initial conditions .",
    "the simplest realization is to set @xmath26 , @xmath27 .    in  @xcite an important new result",
    "has been obtained , making possible the asymptotic analysis for such initial conditions .",
    "first of all , as expected by universality , the position of a particle has fluctuations governed by the goe tracy - widom distribution , @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "this result is a combination of  @xcite and states @xmath29}(t)\\leq - s t^{1/3})=f_1(2s).\\ ] ] more importantly , in  @xcite the analogue of the airy process @xmath25 for flat initial conditions , which we denote by @xmath30 , is identified .",
    "it is a marginal of the signed determinantal point process with the extended kernel ( [ eqkernelcompact ] ) .",
    "here signed refers to the non - positiveness of the measure ( it does not define a probability measure ) .",
    "explicitly , let @xmath31 and let @xmath32 be the one - dimensional laplacian ; then @xmath33 or , equivalently as shown in appendix  [ appcompactkernel ] , @xmath34 this is in complete analogy with the airy process @xmath25 , which is a marginal of the determinantal point process defined by the extended airy kernel .",
    "in theorem  [ thmjointcorr ] we provide a derivation of the fact that the joint distribution of particle positions is given by the fredholm determinant of a kernel .",
    "this is a general result which is then applied to the flat initial conditions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , see theorem  [ thmkernel ] .",
    "the proper rescaling of particle positions is @xmath35}(t)+2ut^{2/3}\\big).\\ ] ] with this rescaling , in the limit of large time @xmath8 , the kernel converges to @xmath36 as shown in theorem  [ thmconvpt ] .",
    "there we show pointwise convergence . in a forthcoming paper",
    "@xcite we will analyze a discrete time version of the tasep and strengthen our result to the convergence of the fredholm determinants .",
    "such a stronger convergence would imply the convergence of ( [ eqrescaling ] ) to @xmath30 in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions .    as a remark we want to point out that , while periodic initial condition does not seem to be accessible by previously known techniques , with the new construction both step and periodic initial conditions can be analyzed .",
    "the technique used so far is the reduction of the model to a determinantal point process via the robinson - schensted - knuth correspondence .",
    "for further references and details on determinantal point processes we refer the reader to surveys  @xcite and the lecture notes  @xcite .",
    "_ reformulation of the result . _",
    "the tasep integrated current at position @xmath37 and time @xmath8 , @xmath38 , is the number of particles which jumped from site @xmath37 to site @xmath39 during the time interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "let us label by @xmath1 the right - most particle starting at position @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 .",
    "thus the result of this paper translates directly to the integrated currents .",
    "the tasep can be mapped to last passage percolation on @xmath43 with i.i.d .",
    "exponentially distributed random variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath44 is the waiting time of particle number @xmath46 to jump from position @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "there is a slight switch in the point of view . for the tasep one considers the particle positions at fixed time @xmath8 , while in last passage percolation",
    ", one studies the last passage time from the origin to points of a given lattice domain @xmath49 .",
    "these two points of view are closely connected .",
    "they can be regarded as taking different cross sections in the bernoulli cone  @xcite .",
    "the problem considered in  @xcite is the point - to - point last passage percolation , which corresponds to the step initial condition for the tasep .",
    "flat initial conditions correspond to the point - to - line percolation .",
    "finally , the same last passage percolation model can be seen as a one - dimensional growth model  @xcite , called discrete polynuclear growth model , which serves as a discretized model for kpz growth  @xcite .",
    "kpz growth is discussed in the books  @xcite but for a recent exposition of kpz universality see  @xcite .",
    "_ universality issue . _",
    "the tasep also has discrete time versions .",
    "one of these is the parallel update rule ( see the review  @xcite ) and it is given as follows . at each time step particles jump to the neighboring right site with probability @xmath50 , provided the target site is empty .",
    "the jumps occurs independently and simultaneously .",
    "there are two interesting limits of the discrete - time tasep , namely @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the continuous - time tasep is obtained by setting the time - unit to @xmath53 and then take .",
    "the limit @xmath52 yields the so - called polynuclear growth ( png ) model , see e.g.  section 2.1.5 of  @xcite .",
    "there , one has a height function @xmath54 on a one - dimensional substrate , and flat initial condition for the tasep translates to growth starting with , also called flat png .    by universality the process @xmath30 is expected to appear in the discrete - time tasep and the png model as well .",
    "universality has been confirmed for step initial conditions and the corresponding png model with droplet growth  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for flat initial conditions , the limit process should be independent on the initial particle spacing .",
    "results in a discrete - time version of the tasep with different initial spacing will be presented in  @xcite .    for the flat png model ,",
    "it is known  @xcite that the height at one fixed point is goe tracy - widom distributed in the limit of large time @xmath8 .",
    "thus , on the basis of the result for the tasep with alternating initial conditions , see theorem  [ thmconvpt ] , we can conjecture the behavior of the flat png model .",
    "[ cong1 ] the properly rescaled height function of the png model with flat initial conditions converges , in the large time limit , to the process @xmath30 .",
    "the scaling exponents are the same and the coefficients can be determined by matching with the png droplet case .",
    "finally , let us discuss the connection to random matrices . for the tasep with the step initial condition , the one - point asymptotic distribution is the gue tracy - widom distribution , @xmath13 , and the whole limit process is the airy process @xmath25 .",
    "the derivation uses an extension of the model to a multi - layer version .",
    "the airy process arises also for a gue matrix diffusion , the so - called @xmath55 dyson s brownian motion  @xcite .",
    "the motion of the properly rescaled largest eigenvalue converges to the airy process .",
    "the connection extends to finitely many of the largest eigenvalues which have the same limiting behavior as the first top layers in the multi - layer png model .    for the tasep with flat initial condition ,",
    "the one - point distribution is the goe tracy - widom distribution and the limit process is @xmath30 . at this point",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that the evolution of the largest eigenvalue of a matrix which follows @xmath56 dyson s brownian motion has the same limiting behavior as the surface height for flat png , namely the @xmath30 process .",
    "the correspondence at the level of top eigenvalues for goe and the top layers of the multi - layer flat png at a fixed position has been proven in  @xcite , making the conjecture even more plausible . knowing the analogue of the airy process for random growth with flat initial conditions one can guess the result for @xmath56 dyson s brownian motion  @xcite .    [ cong2 ] the evolution of the largest eigenvalue of @xmath57 matrices for @xmath56 dyson s brownian motion converges , in the limit @xmath58 and properly rescaled , to the process @xmath30 .",
    "again , the prefactors for the scaling can be easily calculated by matching the known one - point distributions and the behavior of joint distributions at short distances .",
    "this conjecture concerns only the largest eigenvalue and with this approach we are unable to make a conjecture for the other eigenvalues .    to make conjecture  [ cong2 ] more transparent , we explain it in the simpler case of the two - matrix model . there",
    ", one considers two real symmetric @xmath57 matrices , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with joint distribution @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath65 be the largest eigenvalues of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these eigenvalues fluctuate on a scale of order @xmath66 and are non - trivially correlated if one chooses @xmath67 .",
    "then conjecture  [ cong2 ] means that , properly rescaled , the joint distribution of @xmath64 and @xmath65 converges to the two - point joint distribution of the process @xmath30 in the @xmath58 limit .",
    "we also refer to the surveys on the question of universality in mathematics and physics  @xcite and on connections between different models , including random matrices  @xcite .",
