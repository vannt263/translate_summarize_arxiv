    "another approach is bohm s interpretation of quantum mechanics which expresses the schrdinger equation in polar form .",
    "it allows to introduce the concept of a particle trajectory and hence a quantum equivalent phase space .",
    "this approach has been used by schwengelbeck and faisal @xcite to describe chaos in the kicked rotor and later by other workers for the 2-d anisotropic harmonic oscillators @xcite , the hydrogen atom in an external electromagnetic field @xcite and coupled anharmonic oscillators @xcite . for the kicked rotor in 1-d , which is classically chaotic , it turns out that the quantum system is nonchaotic , i.e. the quantum kolmogorov - sinai entropy goes to zero @xcite ( rediscovered in @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to that , the 2-d anisotropic harmonic oscillator , being classically non - chaotic , has been reported to exhibit quantum chaos @xcite .    a comparison with respect to chaotic behavior of the classical system and the quantum system has been investigated also in field theoretic models .",

    "second , in bohm s approach , the mass of the particle occuring in the fluid dynamics picture is the same mass as in the original hamiltonian . in the quantum action ,",
    "the mass is renormalized and in general differs in value from the classical mass .",
    "finally , in contrast to bohm s approach , the quantum action is very close in functional form to the classical action , and hence allows a direct and detailed comparison of phase space , as will be shown below .",
    "the proof of existence of the quantum action in the limit of large imaginary time for hamiltonian systems has been given for 1-d in ref.@xcite . because we consider in this work a 2-d hamiltonian system , and for sake of self consistency we will outline the proof here for arbitrary dimension ( in particular @xmath12 ) .",

    ", right @xmath77.,title=\"fig : \" ] , right @xmath77.,title=\"fig : \" ]    how can we understand the observed behavior ?",
    "the distribution of lyapunov exponents approaching a gaussian with increasing energy is well known from hamiltonian systems with mixed dynamics @xcite .",
    "the shape of the curve and its decreasing width can be understood as a consequence of the central limit theorem , which predicts such behavior for an arithmetic mean of @xmath1 random variables for @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "regular islands in an otherwise chaotic phase space are known to give non - gaussian tails .",
    "what can we say about those tails ?",
    "in hamiltonian chaotic systems , when increasing the energy then phase space becomes more chaotic , i.e. regular islands become smaller or disappear .",
    "thus it is plausible that the non - gaussian tails of the distribution of positive lyaponov exponents , associated with the regular islands , diminish .",
    "we have estimated numerically the weight of non - gaussian tails using a fit of the data by a gaussian distribution .",
    "for example , in the distribution of classical lyapunov exponents corresponding to @xmath77 ( see left column of fig.[[fig : pos_lyap_4xe_l25 ] ] ) , the relative error @xmath121 of such fits is as follows : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , which diminishes with increasing energy .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior is found in the corresponding quantum lyapunov exponents as well as for the data corresponding the coupling parameter @xmath98 .",
    "second , quantum fluctuations which occur in the parameters of the quantum action can be viewed as renormalisation effects of the classical parameters @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath126 ( if sole term of potential would render the system integrable ) is increased , while @xmath118 ( term which drives the system away from integrability ) is decreased ( see tab.[[tab : paramaction ] ] .",
    "hence chaos is reduced in the quantum system .",
    "such increase of the quadratic term has been observed in other systems also and seems to occur more generally .",
    "what is the significance of our findings ?",
    "in particular , what is the physical significance of chaotic properties of trajectories for the quantum system ? ( i ) we found that the quantum action for large transition times allows to construct a quantum analogue phase space for hamiltonian systems with mixed chaotic dynamics .",
    "such phase space resembles the classical phase space , in particular , when the parameter driving chaos is small . for the mixed system considered ,",
    "the quantum analogue phase space , like classical phase space , shows islands of regular behavior interwoven with chaotic regions .",
    "moreover , hyperbolic fixed points occuring in classical phase space survive in the quantum phase space .",
    "we compared quantitatively the classical system with the quantum system and found that the latter is systematically less chaotic than the former .",
    "the reason for such behavior , in our opinion , is the tendency of quantum fluctuations to drive the quantum action nearer to a gaussian fixed point .",
    "moreover , we have investigated the quantum analogue phase space as a function of energy .",
    "we find that such phase space , like the classical phase space , becomes more chaotic when energy increases .",
    "thus introducing a quantum analogue phase space gives a detailed and quantitative measure reflecting how much chaos grows as a function of energy .",
    "\\(ii ) the significance of trajectories can be seen by drawing an analogy with the interpretation of scattering experiments . in a scattering experiment ,",
    "one usually measures counting rates in detectors , which when positioned at different angles give a differential cross section . using theoretical input , like the s - matrix , unitarity , and symmetries like rotational symmetry of the potential",
    ", one can obtain derived quantities , like scattering phase shifts @xmath127 .",
    "they give a picture of scattering as function of energy and indicate the existence of resonances in certain channels ( jumps of phase shift ) .",
    "the partial wave expansion in conjunction with phase shifts @xmath127 gives a representation of the s - matrix and of scattering cross sections .",
    "in analogy to this picture , we consider the quantum action and its trajectories as a parametrisation of the quantum mechanical transition amplitudes . the quantum action and its trajectories are derived quantities .",
    "these trajectories in conjunction with tools of nonlinear dynamics ( poincar sections , lyapunov exponents ) give a picture of ( makes `` visible '' ) the chaotic dynamics in the quantum system .",
    "one may view the lyapunov exponents computed from trajectories of the quantum action in analogy to scattering phase shifts computed from a partial wave analysis of scattering cross sections .",
    "\\(iii ) the trajectories of the quantum analogue phase space gain a particular importance in the interpretation of of the phenomenon of chaos assisted quantum dynamical tunneling .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to tunneling through a potential barrier , however , in this case the classical transition is forbidden by a dynamical law , the presence of a kam surface . the experiments with ultra cold atoms in an amplitude modulated optical standing wave reported by hensinger et al .",
    "@xcite and steck et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that such dynamical tunneling exists and its amplitude is enhanced by chaos .",
    "the tunneling occurs between regions which in classical phase space correspond to regions of stable motion ( fixed points ) . in the quantum system this region",
    "is associated with eigenstates of the floquet operator .",
    "hensinger et al .",
    "point out that `` floquet states do not necessarily overlap well with the regions of regular motion of the classical poincar map , except in the semi - classical limit '' .",
    "steck et al .",

    "we suggest that in order to better understand the mechanism of dynamical tunneling , the role of localized states , decoherence , and a higher number of floquet states , a quantum analogue phase space and its trajectories from the quantum action are a complementary tool and should give additional useful insight in the dynamics of the quantum system .",
