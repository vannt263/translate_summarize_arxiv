    "the solutions of linear elliptic and parabolic equations , with cauchy or dirichlet boundary conditions , have a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "these are classical results which may be traced back to the work of courant , friedrichs and lewy @xcite in the 1920 s and became a standard tool in potential theory@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "a simple example is provided by the heat equation    @xmath0    with solution written either as @xmath1 or as @xmath2 @xmath3 denoting the expectation value , starting from @xmath4 , of the process @xmath5 @xmath6 being the wiener process .",
    "eq.([1.1 ] ) is a _ specification _ of a problem whereas ( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) are _ solutions _ in the sense that they both provide algorithmic means to construct a function satisfying the specification .",
    "an important condition for ( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) to be considered as solutions is the fact that the algorithms are independent of the particular solution , in the first case an integration procedure and in the second the simulation of a solution - independent process . in both cases",
    "the algorithm is the same for all initial conditions .",
    "this should be contrasted with stochastic processes constructed from particular solutions , as has been done for example for the boltzman equation@xcite .",
    "in contrast with the linear problems , explicit solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations , in terms of elementary functions or integrals , are only known in very particular cases .",
    "hence it is in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations that the stochastic method might be most useful .",
    "whenever a solution - independent stochastic process is found that , for arbitrary initial conditions , generates the solution in the sense of eq.([1.3 ] ) , an exact stochastic solution is obtained . in this way the set of equations for which exact solutions are known might be considerably extended .",
    "the exit measures provided by diffusion plus branching processes@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite as well as the stochastic representations recently constructed for the navier - stokes@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , the poisson - vlasov@xcite @xcite , the euler@xcite and a nonlinear fractional differential equation@xcite define initial condition - independent processes for which the mean values of some functionals are solutions to these equations .",
    "therefore , they are exact * stochastic solutions*.    typically , in the stochastic solutions , one deals with a process that starts from the point where the solution is to be found , the solution being then obtained from a functional computed along the whole sample path or until the process hits the boundary .",
    "in addition to providing new exact results , the stochastic solutions are also a promising tool for numerical implementation . here",
    "the relevant question is to know when a stochastic algorithm is competitive with the existing deterministic algorithms .",
    "although there is no general answer to this question , there are a few considerations that suggest where and when stochastic algorithms might be useful , namely :    \\(i ) deterministic algorithms grow exponentially with the dimension @xmath7 of the space , roughly @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the linear size of the grid ) .",
    "this implies that to have reasonable computing times , the number of grid points may not be sufficient to obtain a good local resolution for the solution .",
    "in contrast a stochastic simulation only grows with the dimension of the process , typically of order @xmath7 .",
    "\\(ii ) in general , deterministic algorithms aim at obtaining the behavior of the solution in the whole domain .",
    "that means that , even if an efficient deterministic algorithm exists for the problem , a stochastic algorithm might still be competitive if only localized values of the solution are desired .",
    "this comes from the very nature of the stochastic representation processes that always starts from a definite point in the domain . according to what is desired ,",
    "configuration or fourier space representations should be used .",
    "for example by studying only a few high fourier modes one may obtain information on the small scale fluctuations that only a very fine grid would provide in a deterministic algorithm .",
    "\\(iii ) each time a sample path of the process is implemented , it is independent from any other sample paths that are used to obtain the expectation value .",
    "likewise , paths starting from different points are independent from each other .",
    "therefore the stochastic algorithms are a natural choice for parallel and distributed implementation . provided",
    "some differentiability conditions are satisfied , the process also handles equally well simple or complex boundary conditions .",
    "\\(iv ) stochastic algorithms may also be used for domain decomposition purposes @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "one may , for example , decompose the space in subdomains and then use in each one a deterministic algorithm with dirichlet boundary conditions , the values on the boundaries being determined by a stochastic algorithm .",
    "stochastic solutions also provide an intuitive characterization of the physical phenomena , relating nonlinear interactions to cascading processes . by the study of exit times from a domain",
    "they also provide access to quantities that can not be obtained by perturbative methods@xcite @xcite .",
    "one way to construct stochastic solutions is based on a probabilistic interpretation of the picard series .",
    "first , the differential equation is written as an integral equation .",
    "then there are two possibilities .    in the first case",
    "the series is rearranged in a such a way that the coefficients of the successive terms in the picard iteration , including the initial condition term , obey a normalization condition .",
    "the stochastic solution is then equivalent to importance sampling of the normalized picard series . in this case",
    "the stochastic process , that constructs the solution , is a branching process , the branching being controlled by the nonlinear part of the equation .",
    "the second possibility occurs when the initial condition term is not multiplied by a probability factor .",
    "then , the integral of the integral equation may still be given a probabilistic interpretation but the process that is used for the construction of the solution is more general tree - indexed stochastic process .    in this paper , pursuing the work on kinetic equations initiated in @xcite and @xcite , solutions are obtained for the maxwell - vlasov equation in the approximation where magnetic field fluctuations are neglected and the electrostatic potential is used to compute the electric field .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for plasmas in a strong external magnetic field .",
    "both fourier and configuration space solutions are constructed .    in sect.2.1 one",
    "discusses the formulation of the full maxwell - vlasov system as an integral equation for the charge densities . in sects .",
    "2.1 to 2.4 the solutions to the fourier - transformed equation are obtained both for a static uniform and a slowly varying magnetic field .",
    "the stochastic processes associated to the construction of these solutions are branching processes with the waiting time controlled by the velocity fourier component and the densities ( anti- ) evolved by the linear part of the equation .    in sect.3 one deals with the configuration space equation and in this case",
    "the most natural stochastic formulation involves a general tree - indexed stochastic process .",
    "consider a two - species maxwell - vlasov system in 3 + 1 space - time dimensions @xmath10 @xmath11 , with @xmath12 to study the vlasov - maxwell system as a nonlinear equation for the @xmath13 densities one has to obtain explicit expressions for the electromagnetic fields in terms of the charge densities .",
    "define scalar and vector potentials @xmath14 which , in the lorentz gauge ( @xmath15 ) , obey the equations @xmath16 using the ( retarded ) green s function for the wave equation , @xmath17 one obtains @xmath18 in writing ( [ 4.6 ] ) as a source term solution of ( [ 4.4 ] ) , one has assumed that the initial conditions for the equations ( [ 4.4 ] ) vanish together with their time derivatives or , alternatively , that the initial time is in the remote past so that there are no more contributions from the initial conditions . for a more general solution which should be used for transitory phenomena or plasma probing by short localized pulses see @xcite .",
    "use of ( [ 4.3 ] ) yields @xmath19 replacing now eq.([4.7 ] ) in ( [ 4.1 ] ) one sees that , as a function of the densities @xmath20 , maxwell - vlasov is a nonlinear and nonlocal ( in time ) differential equation .",
    "its full stochastic solution treatment will be dealt with elsewhere . here one deals with approximations of practical interest for fusion plasmas .",
    "first notice that for non - relativistic plasmas the last terms in ( [ 4.7 ] ) are small and in the quasi - static approximation one has @xmath21 furthermore , for microturbulence studies in fusion plasmas in strong magnetic fields , a reasonable approximation neglects magnetic field fluctuations and uses the electrostatic potential of the charges to compute the electric field .",
    "this is what will be called poisson - vlasov in a static ( external ) magnetic field .      in this approximation",
    "the equation is @xmath22 or , in the fourier transformed version @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26    the aim is to obtain stochastic solutions both for the equation in configuration space and for its fourier - transformed version . because of the localized nature of the stochastic solutions , as discussed in the introduction , both types of solutions are useful for the applications . if , in a plasma confinement device , one is interested in the behavior of the solution at a particular point ( for example at a point either in the core or in the scrape - off layer ) then it is the solution in configuration space that is useful . if however one is interested in the nature of the turbulent fluctuations it is probably the study of high fourier modes in the fourier - transformed equation that will be most useful .",
    "eqs.([3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) have linear and nonlinear parts .",
    "the linear evolutions are , respectively @xmath27 the operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 being @xmath30 from ( [ 3.4a ] ) and ( [ 3.4b ] ) it follows that the linear evolution of the function arguments @xmath4 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is ruled by the following equations @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36    one sees from ( [ 3.4d ] ) that the linear evolution of the densities @xmath37 in configuration space acts only on the arguments of the function .",
    "however , from ( [ 3.4e ] ) and ( [ 3.4f ] ) one also sees that , if the magnetic field @xmath38 is not constant in space , the linear evolution of the fourier transformed densities @xmath39 is more complex , involving derivatives of the fourier density . for the stochastic solutions , one associates a process to each function ,",
    "therefore it is not convenient to use the full linear part of the evolution operator in the fourier - transformed equation .",
    "such problem does not exist if the static magnetic field is also uniform in space .",
    "here one starts by studying this case , which is then extended to the case of a slowly varying magnetic field .",
    "consider a uniform magnetic field @xmath40 . in this case",
    "it is possible to obtain an explicit form for the evolution of the linear part , @xmath41 that is @xmath42 with solution @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 , the inverse relation being @xmath46    in integral form eq.([3.4 ] ) becomes    @xmath47    a stochastic solution is going to be written for the following function @xmath48 where @xmath49 if @xmath50 and @xmath51 otherwise .",
    "@xmath52 a positive function to be specified later on .",
    "the integral equation for @xmath53 is @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57    eq.([3.9 ] ) has a stochastic interpretation as an exponential plus a branching process .",
    "the survival probability up to time @xmath58 of the exponential process is @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the decay probability in time @xmath61 , with @xmath62 @xmath63 being a normalizing function @xmath64    in the branching process , @xmath65 is the probability that , from a @xmath32 mode , one obtains a @xmath66 branching with @xmath67 in the volume @xmath68 .    the stochastic interpretation of eq.([3.9 ] ) provides a way to compute the solution",
    "@xmath69 is computed from the expectation value of a multiplicative functional associated to the process .",
    "convergence of the multiplicative functional hinges on the fulfilling of the following conditions :    \\(a ) @xmath70    \\(b ) @xmath71    condition ( b ) is satisfied , for example , for @xmath72 indeed computing @xmath73 one obtains @xmath74 then @xmath75 is bounded by a constant for all @xmath76 , and choosing @xmath77 sufficiently small , condition ( b ) is satisfied .",
    "once @xmath52 consistent with ( b ) is found , condition ( a ) only puts restrictions on the initial conditions .",

    "qualitatively , what the process does is to replace the calculation of the integrals in ( [ 6.4 ] ) by the generation of a family of probability measures and each value of ( [ 6.10 ] ) is a sampling of the corresponding picard iteration .",

    "the algorithms would be quite similar , the main difference being the slightly more complex exponential process .",
    "however , this extra complexity pays off in allowing for solutions without upper time bounds .    for the tree - indexed processes , that construct the configuration space solutions , the implementation could lead to larger computer time requirements because , for each realization",

    "separation of the larmor time scale led to a beautiful body of theory that goes by the name of gyrokinetics@xcite .",
    "a practical motivation for the gyrokinetics reduction comes from the possibility to reduce the dimension of the numerical codes from 6 to 5 or 4 dimensions . with the present improvement of multiprocessor computer power",
    "this motivation has somehow become weaker , especially because of the additional complexity of the gyrokinetics equations if one wants to go beyond the leading order .",
    "that , to obtain any reasonable accuracy , higher gyrokinetic orders should be included in the numerical calculation , is indeed to be expected in view of the fact that the exact invariant associated to the gyrokinetics reduction may , at best , be obtained by a borel - summable infinite series@xcite    nevertheless , if a reduction of the larmor time scale is desired , the stochastic solution approach developed in this paper might also provide an appropriate framework for this reduction .",
    "notice in particular that , in the configuration space stochastic solutions , the magnetic field evolution acts only on the function arguments , that is , on the labels of the stochastic process not on the process itself .",
    "then , averaging techniques or scalar function mappings would provide an alternative formulation of gyrokinetics .",
    "\\3 ) in the stochastic solutions for the configuration space equation and for the non - uniform magnetic field case , operator labels associated to the particles generated in the tree are carried over and applied to the initial conditions when the process arrives to time zero .",
    "this entails some additional complexity in the calculation of the functionals and in the smoothness requirements to be imposed on the initial conditions .",
    "the need for these operator labels arises from the singular nature of the propagation kernels derivatives .",
