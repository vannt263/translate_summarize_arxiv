    "since the late 1980s emerges the idea that a global overview of the protein s energy surface is of paramount importance for a quantitative understanding of the relationships between structure , dynamics , stability , and functional behavior of proteins @xcite . thanks to the continuous increase of the computing power@xcite and of the reliability of empirical force fields @xcite , all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations become a widely employed computational technique to simulate the dynamics of complex systems such as proteins through discrete integration of the newton s equations of motions of each atom . under the assomption of ergodicity",
    "one can then derive the equilibrium properties of interest of a protein as time averages of the corresponding observables along the md trajectories and compute the associated free - energy .",
    "however in several cases all - atom md simulations are still not competitive to describe the protein conformational dynamics , due to the fact that using an atomistic model is computationally expensive , as sufficiently realistic potential energy functions are intrinsically complex .",
    "moreover , most phenomena of interest take place on time scales that are orders of magnitude larger than the accessible time that can be currently simulated with classical all - atom molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "this issue can be addressed either by reducing the dimension of the conformational space explored by the protein during the md simulations by using a coarse - grained representation of the protein structure , where each residue has only a few degrees of freedom and where the solvent surrounding the protein is implicit @xcite , or by accelerating the exploration of the conformational space in ( all - atom ) md simulations . in the latter case ,",
    "a large variety of methods referred to as _ enhanced sampling techniques _ have been proposed @xcite .",
    "they exploit a methodology aimed at accelerating rare events and based on constrained md .",
    "metadynamics ( metad ) @xcite belongs to this class of methods : it enhances the sampling of the conformational space of a system along a few selected degrees of freedom , named collective variables ( cvs ) and reconstructs the probability distribution as a function of these cvs . in a nutshell , the dynamics in the space of the chosen cvs",
    "is enhanced by disfavoring already visited regions through the use of a history - dependent potential , constructed as a sum of gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by the cvs .",
    "this sum of gaussians is then exploited to reconstruct iteratively an estimator of the free - energy surface spanned by the cvs in the region explored during the biased dynamics .",
    "well - tempered metadynamics @xcite ( wtmetad ) is the most recent variant of the method , which , because of its convergence properties , is the most widely adopted version of the metadynamics algorithm . in wtmetad , the bias deposition rate decreases over simulation time and the dynamics of all the microscopic variables becomes progressively closer to thermodynamic equilibrium as the simulation proceeds , making the bias to converge to its limiting value in a single run and avoiding the problem of overfilling , _",
    "i.e. _ when the height of the accumulated gaussians largely exceeds the true barrier height",
    ".    however , wtmetad suffers from the same limitation than standard metad , _",
    "i.e. _ its succes depends on the critical choice of a reasonable number of relevant cvs .",
    "all the relevant slow varying degrees of freedom must be catched by the cvs .",
    "in addition , the number of cvs must be small enough to avoid exceedingly long computational time , while being able to distinguish among the different conformational states of the system .",
    "consequently , identifying a set of cvs appropriate for describing complex processes involves a right understanding of the physics and chemistry of the process under study @xcite . choosing a correct set of cvs",
    "thus remains a challenge , as a whole , independently of the enhanced sampling technique one could consider .",
    "a way to overcome the difficulties to extract the functionally relevant motions from md simulations is to use collective coordinates identifying a low dimensional subspace in which the significant , functional protein motions are expected to take place . principal component analysis ( pca ) of the structure fluctuations of a protein , also called _ essential dynamics _",
    ", is a powerfull method to represent in a space of only a few collective coordinates ( typically between 1 and 3 ) both the functional modes of proteins in their native state @xcite and the folding pathways of certain proteins @xcite .",
    "therefore pca emerges in the last few years as a relevant candidate to reconstruct the protein free - energy landscape both with standard metad and wtmetad @xcite .",
    "these methods show the efficience of this particular class of cvs in terms of convergence time and free - energy reconstruction accuracy .",
    "however it is well known that the smooth appearance of the fes obtained with pca of the fluctuations of the cartesian coordinates of the atoms often represents an artifact of the mixing of the internal and overall motions of the protein @xcite . indeed , whereas the overall translation of a molecule can readily be separated from its internal deformations by requiring that the molecular center of mass is fixed , the elimination of overall rotation of the molecule from its internal motions is only possible for relatively rigid molecular structure , _",
    "i.e. _ for which the structural fluctuations can be described as small departures from a reference molecular structure . in this case , the separation can be achieved by superimposing the structures at the snapshots of a md trajectory to a reference structure , such that the root - mean - square deviations of the fluctuations of the atom positions is minimized @xcite .",
    "while this procedure correctly removes the overall rotation in the limit of small fluctuations , it breaks down in the case of large amplitude motions , where it is not possible to unambiguously define a single reference structure .",
    "it is then interesting to consider the use of linear correlation analysis for internal coordinates , for which the overall motion is safely eliminated without the use of any arbitrary reference structure .",
    "the dihedral angles are appropriate internal coordinates for biopolymers .",
    "however , attention has to be paid to the periodicity of such quantities as the arithmetic mean of dihedral angles can not be easily calculated as in cartesian coordinates .",
    "one can circumvent this problem by considering the method referred to as _",
    "dihedral principal component analysis _",
    "( dpca ) based on ( ramachadran ) dihedral angles @xcite . in dpca , one must perform a transformation from the space of dihedral angles to a metric coordinate space built up by the trigonometric functions of the dihedral angles .",
    "the resulting representation of the dihedral angles is unique and therefore allows us to readily calculate the mean and the covariance matrix .",
    "a constraint of using pca ( or dpca ) to select the relevant cvs representing the functional motions of a protein , is that some prior knowledge of the dynamics of the system under study is necessary",
    ". the structural fluctuations of the molecule must be determined from a preliminary short unbiased md simulation to which dpca is applied .    in the present paper",
    "we perform biased ( @xmath0 ns ) and unbiased ( @xmath1 ) simulations of a penta - peptide , met - enkephalin ( tyr - gly - gly - phe - met ) , which is one of the smallest neurotransmitter peptides @xcite .",
    "because of its important roles in physiological processes as for examples the mediation of pain and respiratory depression , this neuropeptide has been the subject of numerous studies both experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite .",
    "this small flexible peptide does not adopt a single conformation in aqueous solution , that is consistent with the requirement that met - enkephalin be sufficiently flexible to bind to different opioid receptors @xcite , and its free - energy surface is complex and well - structured .",
    "however many aspects of both the structure and dynamics of met - enkephalin in aqueous solution remain unsolved .",
    "we show that coupling wtmetad with the dpca of the ramachadran dihedral angles provides a rugged fel of met - enkephalin , which is very different from the result one can extract from the coupling of wtmetad with the pca of the cartesian coordinates of the atoms .",
    "we demonstrate that combining wtmetad with dpca speeds up the reconstruction of a free - energy surface of the peptide compared with the unbiased md simulations .",
    "finally , we underline a criterion to limit the number of cvs necessary to biased the metadynamics simulation in terms of the existence of the minima of the one - dimensional free - energy profiles associated to ramachandran dihedral angles along the amino - acid sequence .",
    "* md simulation . * all - atom md simulations in explicit water of met - enkephalin ( pdb i d : 1plw ) were carried out with the version 4.5.5 of the gromacs software package @xcite using tip3p water model @xcite and the amber99sb force field @xcite .",
    "biased simulations were performed using version 1.3 of the plugin for free - energy calculation , named plumed @xcite .",
    "the met - enkephalin was solvated in 892 tip3p water molecules enclosed in a cubic box of 27.7 @xmath2 under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the time step used in all simulations was 0.001 ps , and the list of neighbors was updated every 0.005 ps with the `` grid '' method and a cutoff radius of 1.4 nm .",
    "the coordinates of all the atoms in the simulation box were saved every 1 ps . the initial velocities were chosen randomly .",
    "we used the npt ensemble with the temperature and pressure kept to the desired value by using the beredsen method and an isotropic coupling for the pressure ( @xmath3k , @xmath4 fs ; @xmath5 bar , coupling time @xmath6 ps ) .",
    "the electrostatic interactions were computed by using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) algorithm @xcite ( with a radius of 1 nm ) with the fast fourier transform optimization .",
    "the cutoff algorithm was applied for the noncoulomb potentials with a radius of 1 nm . the energy of the model was first optimized with the `` steepest descent minimization '' algorithm and then by using the `` conjugate gradients '' algorithm .",

    "* the set of cvs used in wtmetad simulations were automatically generated from a dpca of the 8 backbone ramachadran dihedral angles @xcite of the unbiased md trajectory . in short , dpca consists in diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the cartesian components of the two - dimensional vectors @xmath8 representing the set of dihedral angles computed from a preliminary unbiased md run , say @xmath9 with @xmath10 in the case of met - enkephalin .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath11 of the covariance matrix are ordered by decreasing value and each collective mode @xmath12 is characterized by @xmath11 and by the corresponding eigenvector @xmath13 .",

    "it emerges from the analysis of [ hierarchicaldpca ] that information about the first five dpcs is necessary to discriminate uniquely the conformational states of the protein .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to analyse the two - dimensional free - energy map ( dpc@xmath77 , dpc@xmath80 ) to link the present analysis to the one obtained with a cartesian pca in sutto et al.@xcite , and to compare our sampled conformations to the litterature values .",
    "visual inspection of [ clustering ] mainly exhibits a quite rugged and complex free - energy landscape which contains numerous minima .",

    "this is however not surprising as the same kind of observations have already been stated by mu et al.@xcite in the case of penta - alanine who related this difference to the artifact of the unavoiding mixing of the internal and overall motion of the peptide in the cartesian pca of its trajectory .",

    "let us note that this is different from the cartesian pca of sutto et al.@xcite , who found a single basin in their fes calculation corresponding to the u - shaped conformations of met - enkephalin . as shown in [ clustering ] , the basin @xmath88 of the ( dpc@xmath77 , dpc@xmath80 ) fes corresponds to a u - shaped conformation in which the phenylalanine and tyrosine side chains are packed .",
    "a move from the @xmath88 basin to the @xmath89 and @xmath90 basins corresponds to torsional deformations of the peptide leading to the unpack of the phenylalanine and tyrosine side chains . in the torsional deformation from @xmath88 to @xmath90 ,",
    "the left and right arms of the u - shaped conformations become aligned causing the midsection of the backbone to untwist .",
    "the passage from one u - shape basin to another requires crossing the largest activation barriers ( of about @xmath91 kj / mol ) on the fes shown in [ clustering ] . except the basins",

    "1.0 cm     the relation between the dpc@xmath77 and dpc@xmath80 and the ramachandran dihedral angles along the sequence of the peptide is given by the value of their influence ( cf .",

    "the lack of uniqueness could have been expected as we show in [ hierarchicaldpca ] that the first 5 dpcs were usefull to describe uniquely all the different conformations of met - enkephalin .",

    "we see that in both cases , the well associated to the global minimum has been accuratly explored .",
    "however the unbiased simulation completely missed the local minimum associated to the ramachandran dihedral angle @xmath111 at @xmath112 rad .",
    "in this paper , we considered a well - tempered metadynamics approach coupled with biased collective variables generated from a dihedral principal component analysis to reconstruct the conformational free - energy landscape of a small and very diffusive pentapeptide .",
    "we compared the accuracy and computational efficiency of wtmetad with dpca with a long unbiased md simulation as well as with the previous study of sutto et al.@xcite that considered wtmetad using biased collective variables generated from cartesian pca .",
    "we reconstructed the expected free - energy surface accurately and quicker than unbiased md simulation , which exhibits a quite rugged and complex appearance different from the single - minima funnel - like shape observed with a cartesian pca .",
    "indeed the dpca differs from cartesian pca by the fact it takes advantage of appropriate internal coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ the ramachandran dihedral angles describing the backbone structure of the protein .",
    "this approach becomes particularly usefull when one considers complex systems as multi - domain proteins @xcite for which we observe diffusion motions of a domain around another one , or intrinsically disordered proteins @xcite characterized by a lack of stable tertiary structure due to high structural flexibility of the protein . in these cases , it is particularly impossible to unambiguously define a single reference structure associated to the cartesian pca procedure and necessary to eliminate the overall rotations of the molecules .",
    "moreover , we underline a new criterion to limit the number of collective variables necessary to biased the metadynamics simulation .",
    "we consider the projection of the cvs on the complete basis represented by the one - dimensional feps of the 8 ramachandran dihedral angles .",
    "the choice of the two first dpcs as cvs for the wtmetad is then related to the capture of the different wells when one considers structures extracted from the clustering analysis in the free - energy map ( dpc@xmath77 , dpc@xmath80 ) .",
    "this criterion is different from the one of sutto et al.@xcite , who justified their limitation to the two first pca eigenvectors , showing that increasing this number considerably slows the convergence of the simulation , performing worse than the unbiased run .",
    "let us now discuss the efficiency of the method in the particular case of the met - enkephalin pentapeptide .",
    "indeed , the dpca over the @xmath50 ns , corresponding to @xmath31 of the whole unbiased md simulation , must be linked to the convergence analysis of the unbiased md simulation based either on the distance measure of alonso and echenique ( cf .",
    "[ alonsoechenique ] ) , or the block analysis ( cf .",
    "[ bse_dpca ] ) .",
    "we notice actually that the unbiased md simulation converged at approximately @xmath0 ns , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the reference @xmath1 unbiased md trajectory .",
    "thus the dpca over the @xmath50 ns only corresponds to @xmath32 of the unbiased md trajectory containing information about the dynamics of the system .",
    "nevertheless , we reconstructed the fes associated to the met - enkephalin pentapeptide in approximately @xmath102 ns which is twice faster than the unbiased md simulation .",
    "this relative modest succes of wtmetad to accelerate the exploration of the conformational space could have been expected .",
    "indeed , the small height of the free - energy barriers and diffusive behavior of the dynamics of met - enkephalin is known to pose an additional challenge to free - energy - based methods like wtmetad that generally perform better in the presence of high free - energy barriers and ballistic dynamics .",
    "let us note that the same modest succes of wtmetad also emerged from the study of sutto et al.@xcite with the use of cartesian pca .",
    "it is thus interesting to extend this method over more complex systems that present more favorable characteristics to apply wtmetad .",
    "this work in progress sets out to demonstrate this approach on different well - know test proteins and more complex systems as multi - domain proteins that represent nowadays a real challenge for the biophysics community .",
    "the authors acknowledge y. cote , p. delarue and a. nicolai for useful discussions and advice concerning md simulations with the gromacs software package .",
    "thanks ludovico sutto for fruitful discussions concerning the plumed plugin for free - energy calculation .",
    "this research was conducted by using the computational resources of the `` centre de calcul de luniversit de bourgogne '' ( ccub ) .",
