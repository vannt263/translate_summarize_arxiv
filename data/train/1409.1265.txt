    "we started this work with the simple notion to explore the phases of variable stars , given the possibility of intentional modulation by some advanced intelligence @xcite .",
    "the essence of the original idea was that variable stars are a natural target of study for any civilization due to the fact of their correlation between period and total light output .",
    "this correlation has allowed them to become the first rung in the astronomical distance ladder , a fact noted in 1912 by henrietta leavitt @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such oscillators are sure to have a period of instability at which time they are sensitive to perturbations , and which can be triggered to flare earlier in their cycle than otherwise .",
    "if some intelligence can do this in a regular manner , they have the basis of a galactic semaphore for communicating not only within one galaxy , but in the instance of brighter cepheids with many galaxies .",
    "this would be a one - way communication , like a radio station broadcasting indiscriminately .",
    "one may speculate endlessly about the motivation for such communication ; we only aver that there are many possibilities and given our complete ignorance of any other intelligence in the universe , we can only hope we will recognize signs of artificiality when we see them",
    ".    we must be careful to acknowledge that we are fully aware that this is a mission seemingly highly unlikely to succeed , but the payoff could be so great it is exciting to try . in what we report below , we have begun such an investigation , and found some behaviour in a variable star that is , at first glance , very hard to understand as a natural phenomenon . a deeper analysis of simultaneous pulsations then shows its most likely natural origin .",
    "this opens the stage for a discussion of what kind of artificiality we should look for in future searches .    by way of more detailed introduction , astronomers who study variable stars in the past have had generally sparsely sampled data , and in earlier times even finding the periodicity was an accomplishment worth publishing .",
    "various analytical methods were used , such as the venerable string method , which involves folding the observed magnitudes to a common one cycle graph , phase ordering and connecting the points by a virtual string @xcite .",
    "editing of events which did not fit well was common .",
    "one moved the trial period until the string length was minimized .",
    "in more recent times with better computing ability , the use of lomb - scargle folding @xcite and fourier transforms @xcite has become prominent . for our purposes however , such transforms obliterate the cycle to cycle variations we seek , and so we have started afresh looking at the individual peak - to - peak periods and their modulation .",
    "the type of analysis we want to carry out could not have been done even a few years ago , since it requires many frequent observations on a single star , with good control over the photometry over time .",
    "this is very hard to do from earth  we seem to be , accidentally , on the wrong planet for the study of one major type of variables , the rr lyrae stars @xcite .",
    "typically , these stars pulsate with periods near 0.5 days ( a few have shorter or longer periods ) .",
    "this is unfortunately well - matched to the length of a night on earth . even in case of good weather , and when observing every night from the same location , still every second cycle is lost due to it occurring while the observation site is in daylight .",
    "this changed with the latest generation of space telescopes , such as _ kepler _ and _ corot_. the _ kepler _ satellite was launched in 2009 with a primary mission of detecting the photometric signatures of planets transiting stars .",
    "_ kepler _ had a duty cycle of up to 99% , and was pointed at the same sky location at all times .",
    "the high - quality , near uninterrupted data have also been used for other purposes , such as studying variable stars .",
    "one such finding was a remarkable , but previously completely undetected and unsuspected behavior : period - doubling .",
    "this is a two - cycle modulation of the light curve of blazhko - type rr lyrae stars . and",
    "it is not a small effect : in many cases , every other peak brightness is different from the previous one by up to 10% @xcite .",
    "this has escaped earth - bound astronomers for reasons explained above .",
    "our idea was to search for period variations in variable stars .",
    "we employed the database best suited for this today , nearly uninterrupted photometry from the _ kepler _ spacecraft , covering 4 years of observations with ultra - high precision @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we describe this process using rrc lyrae kic 5520878 as an example . for this star",
    ", we have found the most peculiar effects which are described in this paper . for comparison",
    ", we have also applied the same analysis for other variable stars , as will be described in the following sections .",
    "kic 5520878 is a rrc lyrae star with a period of @xmath1=0.26917082 days ( the number of digits giving a measure of the accuracy of the value @xcite ) .",
    "it lies in the field of view of the _ kepler _ spacecraft , together with 40 other rr lyrae stars , out of which 4 are of subtype rrc .",
    "only one cepheid is known in the area covered by _",
    "kepler _ @xcite . the brightness of kic5520878 , measured as the _ kepler magnitude _ , is _ _ kp__=14.214 .",
    "the _ kepler _ data were downloaded from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) in fits format and all files were merged with _",
    "( bristol university ) .",
    "the data come with adjustments for barycentering ( and the corrections applied ) , and flux data are available as raw simple aperture photometry ( called _ sap _ by the kepler team ) .",
    "there is also a pre - cleaned version available called _ pdcsap _ , which includes corrections for drift , discontinuities and events such as cosmic rays .",
    "the kepler data characteristics handbook @xcite points out that this cleaning process `` [ does not ] perfectly preserve general stellar variability '' and investigators should use their own cleaning routines where needed .",
    "for the period length analysis explained in the next sections , we have tried both _",
    "sap _ and _ pdcsap _ data , as well as applied our own correction obtained from nearby reference stars .",
    "all three data sets gave identical results .",
    "this is due to the corrections being much smaller than intrinsic stellar variations : while instrumental amplitude drifts are in the range of a few percent over the course of months , the star s amplitude changes by @xmath240% during its 0.269d ( 6.5hr ) cycle . for a detailed study of best - practice detrending in rr lyrae stars",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "most commonly , fourier decomposition is used to determine periodicity .",
    "other methods are phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) , fitting polynomials , or smoothing for peak / low detection .",
    "the fourier transformation ( ft ) and its relatives ( such as the least - squares spectral analysis used by lomb ",
    "scargle for reduction of noise caused by large gaps ) have their strength in showing the total spectrum .",
    "ft , however , can not deliver clear details about trends in or evolution of periodicity .",
    "this is also true for pdm , as it does not identify pure phase variations , since it uses the whole light curve to obtain the solution @xcite .",
    "the focus of our study was pulsation period length , and its trends .",
    "we have therefore tried different methods to detect individual peaks ( and lows for comparison ) .    in the short cadence data ( 1 minute integrations )",
    ", we found that many methods work equally well .",
    "as the average period length of kic 5520878 is @xmath20.269 days , we have @xmath2387 data points in one cycle .",
    "first of all , we tried eye - balling the time of the peaks and noted approximate times .",
    "as there is some jitter on the top of most peaks , we then employed a centered moving - average ( trying different lengths ) to smooth this out , and calculated the maxima of this smoothed curve .",
    "afterwards , we fitted n - th order polynomials , trying different numbers of terms .",
    "while this is computationally more expensive , it virtually gave the same results as eye - balling and smoothing .",
    "deviations between the methods are on the order of a few data points ( minutes ) .",
    "we judge these approaches to be robust and equally suitable .",
    "finally , we opted to proceed with the peak times derived with the smoothing approach as this is least susceptible for errors .",
    "in the long cadence data ( 30 minutes ) , there are only @xmath213 data points in one cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) . simply using the bin with the highest luminosity thus introduces large timing errors .",
    "we tried fitting templates to the curve , but found this very difficult due to considerable change in the shape of the light curve from cycle to cycle .",
    "this stems from two main effects : amplitude variations of @xmath23% cycle - to - cycle , and the seemingly random occurrence of a bump during luminosity increase , when luminosity rises steeply and then takes a short break before reaching its maximum .",
    "we found fitting polynomials to be more efficient , and tested the results for varying number of terms and number of data points involved .",
    "the benchmark we employed was the short cadence data , which gave us 1,810 cycles for comparison with the long cadence data .",
    "we found the best result to be a 5th - order - polynomial fitted to the 7 highest data points of each cycle , with new parameters for each cycle .",
    "this gave an average deviation of only 4.2 minutes , when compared to the short cadence data .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] shows a typical fit for short and long cadence data .",
    "both peak finding methods applied : square symbols show lc data points , with a @xmath3-order polynomial fitted to the 7 highest values .",
    "the right of the vertical lines indicates the lc peak from this method .",
    "the small dots below are the sc data points , shifted by @xmath4 downwards for better visibility .",
    "the peak of the sc data , derived with the smoothing method , is shown by the left of the vertical lines .",
    "the two times indicated by the two lines differ by 4 minutes .",
    "this is also the average deviation for sc versus lc data .",
    "times are in barycentric julian date ( mjd-2454833),scaledwidth=80.0% ]      during the 4 years of kepler data , 5,417 pulsation periods passed .",
    "we obtained the lengths of 4,707 of these periods ( 87% ) , while 707 cycles ( 13% ) were lost due to spacecraft downtimes and data glitches . out of the 4,707 periods we obtained , we had short cadence data for 1,810 periods ( 38% ) . for the other 62% of pulsations , we used long cadence data .",
    "the errors given by the kepler team for short integrations ( 1 minute ) for kic 5520878 are @xmath535e^-^/sec for the flux ( that is 0.1% of an average flux of 35,000e^-^/sec ) .",
    "these errors are smaller than the point size of fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] , which shows the complete data set .",
    "we have applied corrections for instrumental drift by matching to nearby stable stars .",
    "some instrumental residuals on the level of a few percent remain , which are very hard to clean out in such a strongly variable star .",
    "as explained above , these variations are irrelevant for our period length determination .",

    "kic 5520878 has been found to be metal - rich . when expressed as [ fe / h ] , which gives the logarithm of the ratio of a star s iron abundance compared to that of our sun ,",
    "kic 5520878 has a ratio of [ fe / h]=-0.36@xmath60.06 , that is about half of that of our sun .",
    "this information comes from a spectroscopic study with the keck - i 10 m hires echelle spectrograph for the 41 rr lyrae in the kepler field of view @xcite .",
    "the study also derived temperatures ( kic 5520878 : 7,250 k , the second hottest in the sample ) and radial velocity of -0.70@xmath60.29 km / s .    when compared to the other rr lyrae from kepler , or more generally in our solar neighborhood , it becomes clear that metal - rich rr lyrae are rare .",
    "most ( 95% ) rr lyrae seem to be old ( @xmath710gyr @xcite ) , metal - poor stars with high radial velocity @xcite .",
    "they belong to the halo population of the galaxy , orbiting around the galactic center with average velocities of @xmath2230km / s .",
    "there seems to exist , however , a second population of rr lyrae .",
    "their high metallicity is a strong indicator of their younger age , as heavy elements were not common in the early universe .",
    "small radial velocities point towards them co - moving with the galactic rotation and , thus , them belonging to the younger population of the galactic disk , sometimes divided into the very young thin disk and the somewhat older thick disk .",

    "black dots represent sub - type rrab , while gray squares represent sub - type rrc . ]",
    "rr lyrae stars are part of our cosmic distance ladder , due to the peculiar fact that their absolute luminosity is simply related to their period , and hence if one measures the period one gets the light output . by observing the apparent brightness , one",
    "can then derive the distance .",
    "the empirical relation is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the apparent magnitude and @xmath10 the absolute magnitude . if we take _ _",
    "kp__=14.214 for kic5520878 and @xmath11 for rr lyrae stars @xcite , the distance calculates to @xmath12kpc ( or @xmath216,000 ly ) , that is @xmath216% of the diameter of our galaxy  the star is not quite in our neighborhood .",
    "taking an empirical relation of pulsation period @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 of rr lyrae stars @xcite of @xmath15 , one can derive @xmath16 for kic 5520878 . the inclination angle",
    "@xmath17 is not derivable with the data available .",
    "thus , a corresponding minimum rotation period would be @xmath18 days at @xmath19 , or 47.8 days at @xmath20 .",
    "the minimum rotation period of 33.8 days is equivalent to @xmath2126 cycles ( of 0.269 days length ) , so that the rotation period is much slower than the pulsation period .",
    "kic5520878 has been studied in detail @xcite . in a fourier analysis , a secondary frequency @xmath21 days )",
    "was found .",
    "the author calculates a ratio @xmath22 , a rare but known ratio among rr lyrae stars .",
    "this rareness is probably caused by instrumental bias , as these secondary frequencies are low in amplitude , and were only detected with the rise of high - quality time - series photometry ( e.g. ogle ) and milli - mag precision space photometry .",
    "indeed , the @xmath20.6 period ratio was detected in six out of six randomly selected rrc stars observed with space telescopes @xcite .",
    "in addition , significant subharmonics were found with the strongest being @xmath23 days ) , that is at @xmath24 .",
    "their presence is described as `` a characteristic signature of a period doubling of the secondary mode , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "its origin can be traced to a half - integer resonance between the pulsation modes ( moskalik , buchler 1990 ) . ''",
    "the author also compares several rrc stars and finds `` the richest harvest of low amplitude modes ( @xmath26 ) in kic5520878 , where 15 such oscillations are detected .",
    "based on the period ratios , one of these modes can be identified with the second radial overtone , but all others must be nonradial .",
    "interestingly , several modes have frequencies significantly lower than the radial fundamental mode .",
    "this implies that these nonradial oscillations are not p - modes , but must be of either gravity or mixed mode character . ''",
    "these other frequencies are usually said to be non - radial , but could also be explained by `` pure radial pulsation combinations of the frequencies of radial fundamental and overtone modes '' @xcite . however , this explanation might only apply to fundamental - mode ( rrab ) stars .",
    "since rrab and rrc stars pulsate in different modes , period ratios in one class might tell little about the period ratios in the other class .",
    "the @xmath20.6 period ratio is close to the fundamental mode - second overtone period ratio , but there are no radial modes that fall to this value against the first overtone , and thus the @xmath27-mode is commonly identified as non - radial .    in section  [ sec : prime ]",
    "we explore the fourier spectrum in more detail .",
    "unusual frequencies might be contributed by an unresolved companion with a different variability . to check this ,",
    "we have obtained observations down to magnitude 19.6 with a privately owned telescope and a clear filter .",
    "using a resolution of 0.9px / arcsec , it can be easily seen that a faint ( 18.6mag ) companion is present at a distance of @xmath287 arcsec , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "the standard kepler aperture mask fully contains this companion , however the magnitude difference between this uncataloged companion and kic5520878 is larger than 4.4 magnitudes , so that the light contribution into our kepler photometry is very small . at a distance of 4.9kpc ,",
    "the projected distance of this companion is @xmath280.15 parsec , resulting in a potential circular orbit of @xmath29 years .",
    "the most likely case is , however , that this star is simply an unrelated , faint background ( or foreground ) star with negligible impact to kepler photometry .",
    "a second argument can be made against blending : with fourier transforms , linear combinations of frequencies can be found .",

    "peak - to - peak , the variation is in the range [ 0.24d to 0.30d ] , low - to - low in the range [ 0.26d to 0.28d ] . for any given cycle , the qualitative result of measuring through the lows and through the peaks is equivalent , meaning that a short ( long ) period is measured to be short ( long ) , no matter whether peaks or lows are used .",
    "as the peak - to - peak method gives larger nominal differences ( and thus better signal - to - noise ) , we focus on the peak times from here on .",
    "the variation seems to fluctuate in cycles of variable length .",
    "we estimate maxima at bjd@xmath2164 , 317 , 533 , 746 , 964 , 1328 and 1503 .",
    "their separation is then ( in days ) : 153 , 216 , 213 , 218 , 364 and 175 ( fig .  [ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "as some of these are near one earth ( kepler ) year , or half of it , we have to carefully judge the data regarding barycentering , which has been performed by the kepler team .",
    "we argue against a barycentering error for three reasons : first , the differences caused by barycentering between two subsequent cycles are negligible ( @xmath32s ) , while the cycle has an average length of @xmath2387 minutes .",
    "second , the cycles are of varying length , while a year is not . third , the large kepler community would most likely already have found such a major error .",

    "the function then gives values of close to 0 or close to 0.5 for odd numbers , while for even numbers it gives other values .",
    "when re - normalized to the usual acf range of [ -1 , + 1 ] , this gives high absolute autocorrelation for odd numbers , and less so for even numbers .",

    "one might raise the question whether some of the observed perturbations are caused by planetary influence , either through transits , or indirectly by gravitational influence of an orbiting planet , or massive companion . with regard to the observed secondary frequency @xmath48",
    ", it seems rather on the short side compared to the almost 2,000 planets discovered so far , but a few of these fall in the same period range @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of perturbations visible as non - radial modes , perhaps caused by gravitationally deforming the star elliptically .",
    "another possible mechanism observed in our own sun concerns the relation between the barycenter for the star and its convection pattern @xcite",
    ".    however , the evolutionary state of rr lyrae makes it unlikely for them to possess planets .",
    "these stars are old and after exhausting their core hydrogen , have gone through the red giant phase and possessed very extended envelopes ( up to 20 - 100 @xmath49@xcite ) .",
    "theoretical calculations by @xcite predicted that no planet of 1m@xmath50 could survive around a giant 2m@xmath51 star closer than 2.1 au .",
    "observational data loosens this limit , but the distance distribution of the @xmath250 planets known around giant stars shows a hard cut - off at 0.5 au @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the variable luminosity of rr lyrae must make the evolution of life as we know it on ( likely rare ) orbiting planets very difficult . during a star s evolution ,",
    "the habitable zone shifts dramatically , so that any lifeforms would need to accommodate , e.g. by moving to other planets or by moving their habitat . on the other hand ,",
    "rr lyrae are older than 10 gyr , giving potential life more time for evolution than on earth",
    ". a last speculative possibility would be that an advanced civilization would originate from some other nearby more average star and travel to an rr lyrae for a modulation mission .",
    "we provide two very simple dynamical models to elucidate the pulsations described above , especially with regard to the frequency content and the asymmetry of the light curve .",
    "while we hope that these phenomenological models capture some of the essence of the observed pulsation variations , they in no way substitute for well - developed , detailed hydrodynamics models , such as the warsaw or florida - budapest codes @xcite , which can properly follow the pulsations inside the star and , for example , naturally explain the bumps in the light curve by incorporating shockwaves in the stellar layers . like the descriptive formalism of benk and colleagues @xcite ,",
    "our models are intended as simple dynamical analogues , which aim to mathematically reproduce the radial motions of the star while remaining agnostic about the deep underlying physics , including the effects of factors like opacity and temperature variations .",

    "<S> learned et al . proposed that a sufficiently advanced extra - terrestrial civilization may tickle cepheid and rr lyrae variable stars with a neutrino beam at the right time , thus causing them to trigger early and jogging the otherwise very regular phase of their expansion and contraction </S>",
    "<S> this would turn these stars into beacons to transmit information throughout the galaxy and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to search for signs of phase modulation ( in the regime of short pulse duration ) and patterns , which could be indicative of intentional , omnidirectional signaling .    </S>",
    "<S> we have performed such a search among variable stars using photometric data from the kepler space telescope . in the rrc lyrae star kic 5520878 , </S>",
    "<S> we have found two such regimes of long and short pulse durations . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of period lengths , expressed as time series data , is strongly auto correlated , with correlation coefficients of prime numbers being significantly higher ( @xmath0% ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of this candidate star shows that the prime number oddity originates from two simultaneous pulsation periods and is likely of natural origin .    </S>",
    "<S> simple physical models elucidate the frequency content and asymmetries of the kic 5520878 light curve .    despite this seti null result , </S>",
    "<S> we encourage testing other archival and future time - series photometry for signs of modulated stars . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done as a by - product to the standard analysis , and even partly automated . </S>"
