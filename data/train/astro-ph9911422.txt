    "with the advent of the hubble space telescope and large optical telescopes , planetary nebulae ( pne ) came to be known to possess complex structures including multiple shells and collimated outflows , of which the origins still remain puzzling ( e.g. gurzadyan 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , pne display various nebular morphology ranging from elliptical to spherical , bipolar ( or of butterfly shape ) , point - symmetrical and irregular .",
    "however , the physical explanation for the morphological diversity is not found ( e.g. corradi & schwarz 1995 ) .    noting that symbiotic stars , widely known to be binary systems of a cool giant and a hot white dwarf or a main sequence star , exhibit bipolar emission nebulae , soker ( 1998 ) advocated the view that the bipolar morphology in planetary nebulae is attributed to the binarity in the central star system .",
    "evolutionary links between symbiotic stars and pne have been also proposed by a number of researchers ( e.g. corradi 1995 ) .",
    "currently one of the most controversial issues is the existence of an accretion disk in symbiotic stars and bipolar pne . according to the recent sph computations by mastrodemos & morris ( 1998 ) , in a detached binary system consisting of a mass losing giant and a companion star , the slow and dusty stellar wind from the giant may induce the formation of an accretion disk around the companion star ( see",
    "also theuns et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "circumstantial evidence supporting this scenario was provided by lee & park ( 1999 ) , who proposed that a disk type emission model can naturally explain the main characteristics of the profiles and the polarized fluxes of the raman - scattered 6830 and 7088   features in the symbiotic star rr tel .",
    "the raman scattering process by atomic hydrogen has been introduced by schmid ( 1989 ) , who identified the 6830 and 7088    bands in symbiotic stars as the raman scattered o  vi 1032 , 1038 doublet . a thick h  i component around the giant companion in a symbiotic star",
    "is believed to act as the raman - scatterer which converts the uv continuum around ly@xmath2 into the optical continuum .    the young and compact pn ic  4997 is particularly interesting in that it also displays a hint of bipolar morphology , as is revealed in the radio image presented by miranda & torrelles ( 1998 ) .",
    "miranda et al . ( 1996 ) presented spectroscopy of ic  4997 which shows very broad wings around h@xmath1 with fwhm @xmath6 .",
    "ic  4997 is not the only pn showing the broad h@xmath1 wings .",
    "the bipolar planetary nebula m  2 - 9 is also known to exhibit extremely broad wings with width @xmath7 in h@xmath1 ( balick 1989 , see also torres - peimbert & arrieta 1998 ) .",
    "patriarchi and perinotto ( 1991 ) used the iue data of 159 planetary nebulae to find that about 60 per cent of central stars have a stellar wind with a measured edge velocity ranging 600 to @xmath8 .",
    "feibelman ( 1982 ) presented iue spectroscopy of ic  4997 and found no evidence of p - cygni profile in c  iv 1550 doublet , which strongly implies the absence of strong stellar winds around the central star .",
    "this makes it difficult to attribute the broad wing around h@xmath1 in ic  4997 to the kinematics associated with the fast stellar wind .",
    "electron scattering has been often invoked to explain the wing formation in luminous blue variables ( bernat & lambert 1978 ) .",
    "however , it does not appear to be the case in ic 4997 since the thomson scattering cross section is independent of wavelength and therefore broad wings should be present around other emission lines .",
    "furthermore , in a planetary nebula , it is difficult to incorporate an electron scattering component with the electron temperature @xmath9 and a sufficient scattering optical depth .    an interesting observation of ic  4997 is provided by altschuler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who reported the detection of h  i in ic  4997 by observing the 21 cm absorption dip ( see also schneider et al .",
    "1987 ) . with a large amount of atomic hydrogen",
    ", the broad wings around h@xmath1 can be formed by rayleigh - raman scattering , where the incident radiation in the vicinity of ly@xmath2 converted to the radiation around h@xmath1 with a width broadened by a factor of @xmath10 due to the incoherency of the scattering process . in this letter",
    ", we investigate the broad h@xmath1 wing formation through the rayleigh - raman scattering process and discuss the implications on the astrophysics of bipolar planetary nebulae .",
    "in this work , we adopt a simple model to investigate the wing formation through the rayleigh - raman process .",
    "we assume that the scattering region is in the form of a finite slab with the column density @xmath11 with the solid angle @xmath12 with respect to the radiation source , which coincides with the central star of the planetary nebula .",
    "we discuss the ly@xmath2 line radiation source in the next subsection and now we assume that the scattering region is illuminated by a far uv radiation source with intensity @xmath13",
    ".    a uv photon around ly@xmath2 is incident on a hydrogen atom in the ground state @xmath14 , which subsequently de - excites either to the @xmath15 state re - emitting an optical photon around h@xmath1 ( raman scattering ) or to the @xmath14 state resulting in an outgoing uv photon with the same frequency ( rayleigh scattering ) .",
    "depending on the scattering optical depth , a uv photon may suffer a number of rayleigh scatterings followed by a raman scattering and escape the scattering region , because the @xmath15 state is usually populated negligibly compared with the ground state .",
    "the incident wavelength @xmath16 and the wavelength @xmath17 of the raman - scattered radiation are related by the energy conservation , @xmath18 which yields the conversion of the wavelength interval @xmath19 because of the factor @xmath20 , uv photons with a width @xmath21 centered at ly@xmath2 are spread around h@xmath1 with a broadened width @xmath22 .",
    "the number of uv photons incident on the scattering region per unit time per unit wavelength interval is given by @xmath23 .",
    "we introduce the parameter @xmath24 , which is the conversion factor from uv to optical through the rayleigh - raman scattering process .",
    "the conversion factor @xmath24 depends sensitively on the wavelength and the column density as well as the detailed geometry of the scattering region , and can be computed using a monte carlo technique ( see lee & yun 1998 ) .",
    "the number of raman - scattered photons coming out from the region per unit time per unit wavelength interval is given by @xmath25c_r(\\lambda )   \\lambda_i^2/\\lambda_o^2.\\ ] ] therefore , the raman - scattered flux is @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] is the flux that would be observed from the radiation source with a size @xmath28 located at a distance @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] is the effective raman conversion efficiency .      in fig .  1 , we present the raman conversion efficiency @xmath31 for h  i column densities @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , using the monte carlo code developed by lee & yun ( 1998 ) . in the optically thin regime ,",
    "the single scattering approximation holds so that @xmath34 in the optically thick limit , the conversion rate is investigated by lee & lee ( 1997 ) , who proposed an empirical relation @xmath35   f(n),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 .",
    "here , @xmath37 is the escape probability from the @xmath38th scattering site , and @xmath39 is the photon number flux scattered no less than @xmath38 times which is obtained recursively by @xmath40f(n).\\ ] ] a direct substitution with @xmath41 near the line center yields @xmath42 , which is in excellent agreement with the result shown in fig .  1 .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the ly@xmath2 flux that may enter the scattering region .",
    "hyung et al . (",
    "1994 ) performed a photoionization computation to conclude that the observed emission lines are reproduced approximately using a model consisting of a thin shell of density @xmath43 surrounded by a much larger shell with a much lower density @xmath44 .",
    "they also noted that the n  iii ] @xmath45 ratio may indicate the existence of a much denser region with @xmath46 ( e.g. see czyzak et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "we use the photoionization code ` cloudy 90.05 ' developed by ferland ( 1996 ) to obtain the ly@xmath2 flux that is expected around a central star of a pn .",
    "we fix the temperature and radius of the central star to be @xmath47 , @xmath48 and compute the hydrogen emission line fluxes for densities @xmath49 . according to hyung et al .",
    "( 1994 ) the observed h@xmath1 luminosity is @xmath50 assuming the distance @xmath51 to ic  4997 and the interstellar extinction parameter @xmath52 = log i(h@xmath2)/f(h@xmath2 ) = 0.8 where the observed flux f(h@xmath2 ) in h@xmath2 = 2.95@xmath53 ergs  s@xmath54  @xmath55 .    in table  1",
    ", we show the result .",
    "this shows that the observed h@xmath1 flux is obtained from a region of density @xmath43 , for which we get a much smaller ly@xmath2 flux .",
    "however , when @xmath56 , a much larger ly@xmath2 flux is obtained . therefore , if there exists an emission region of density @xmath57 , we may have a sufficient number of ly@xmath2 photons to fill the h@xmath1 wings .",
    "furthermore , this region is plausibly located much closer to the central star than other emission regions are . hence assuming that the distance is @xmath58",
    ", we may expect that there is a high velocity dispersion of order @xmath59 in the region .",
    "in fig .  2 , by the dotted lines we show the h@xmath1 wings expected from the rayleigh - raman processes . for the incident ly@xmath2 flux we use @xmath60 , which is expected to be obtained from an unresolved core of high density @xmath57 near the central star .",
    "we tested two types of profiles for the incident ly@xmath2 flux , that is , a top - hat profile with a width of @xmath61 and a gaussian with the same velocity width .",
    "we present the results for the best - fitting column density of the scattering region which is @xmath62 for the incident top - hat profile and @xmath63 for the gaussian profile . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate only on the wing parts farther than @xmath64 ( @xmath65 around h@xmath1 ) from the line center .    because the top - hat profile for the incident ly@xmath2 provides an excellent fit to the observed h@xmath1 wing profile",
    ", we expect that other types of input profiles can also produce a good fit except for some extreme cases .",
    "this is illustrated by another good fit using a gaussian profile shown in fig .",
    "however , we realize the much higher column density , i.e. by a factor of 2 , is required in the latter case .    in this work ,",
    "the incident ly@xmath2 flux was computed with a highly simplified assumption .",
    "an introduction of a velocity field in the emission region may alter drastically both the strength and the profile of the emergent line flux .",
    "furthermore the scattering region is complex and consists of a number of components differing in column density and geometrical shape .",
    "therefore , a better fit can be assured from composite scattering region models and more complicated radiative transfer , which are deferred to a future investigation .",
    "since the extreme wings are formed by the scatterers located in the equatorial region , we predict stronger polarization in these regions than in the near center regions that are formed by scatterers distributed nearly spherically .",
    "the exact location of the scattering region with @xmath66 is not well - constrained from this analysis .",
    "if the bipolar morphology has originated from a binary central star system as in symbiotic stars advocated by soker ( 1998 ) , the binary companion of ic  4997 may provide a scattering site in the form of an extended stellar atmosphere or a slow and probably dusty stellar wind .",
    "this situation is often met in symbiotic stars , where a slow and thick wind from a giant companion may act as a raman scattering site . in this picture , the column density of @xmath67 is more plausibly attributed to the slow stellar wind .    in the bipolar planetary nebula",
    "m2 - 9 , balick ( 1989 ) observed the spectrum similar to that of the symbiotic star rr tel .",
    "m2 - 9 might be the case of a binary central star system .",
    "since there exists a thick circumstellar region in m2 - 9 , the extremely wide h@xmath1 wings with a width @xmath68 are likely to be formed through the raman process in a scattering region of column density @xmath69 .",
    "broad h@xmath1 wings are found in a number of post - agb stars according to a recent report by van de steene et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who excluded several theoretical possibilities as the wing formation mechanism including thomson scattering and rayleigh scattering . considering that in post - agb stars much h  i can be found in the stellar wind region and/or in a dense torus surrounding the central star , it is very convincing that the broad h@xmath1 wings in these systems are also attributable to rayleigh - raman scattering .",
    "so far the raman - scattering is unique to symbiotic stars and the only exception appears to be the young planetary nebula ngc  7027 , from which a raman - scattered he  ii line has been identified ( pquignot et al .",
    "1997 ) . from this study",
    "broad h@xmath1 wings are expected to be found in a hot and dense h  ii region surrounded by an h  i region , where the conditions may be met in objects including symbiotic stars , supernova remnants , and galactic supershells .",
    "since the rayleigh - raman scattering provides a strong constraint on the amount of h  i in the nebula , it can be an important tool in studying the mass loss process in the late stage of agb evolution . through high quality spectra around balmer emission lines ,",
    "the physical parameters of the central star can be estimated , which is complementary to the information obtained by other methods such as the zanstra method .",
    "we also note that spectropolarimetry can provide more detailed structural information as mentioned in section 3 .",
