    "jellium model ( jm ) with spherical geometry is the simplest model used in theoretical study of simple metal clusters.@xcite in the spherical jm , the ions are smeared into a uniform positive charge background sphere of density @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath3 are the valence of the atom and the number of constituent atoms of the cluster , respectively . in the simple jm calculations the value of @xmath14 is taken to be the bulk value of the wigner - seitz ( ws ) radius of the metal . in some calculations involving metal surfaces , one may use diffuse jm to take account of the ion relaxations at the surface of that metal.@xcite however , it is a well - known fact@xcite that the simple jm yields negative surface energies at high electron densities ( @xmath15 ) , and negative bulk moduli for @xmath16 . also , using the simple jm , it is not possible to find a realistic size and energetics for metal clusters .",

    "have introduced the stabilized jellium@xcite model ( sjm ) by adding two corrections to the simple jm energy .",
    "the first correction subtracts the spurious self - energy of each ws cell from the jm energy , and the second correction adds to the energy the effect of difference in the potential an electron sees from the discrete pseudoions and from the jellium background . the second correction introduces the core radius parameter , @xmath18 , of the pseudopotential which can be adjusted in such a way that the stability of the bulk jellium system could be achieved at any observed @xmath14 value for the valence electrons . using the value @xmath19 for the core radius ( which stabilizes the unpolarized bulk system ) in the sjm energy functional of a spin - polarized bulk system or a cluster , it is possible to find the equilibrium @xmath14 value for",
    "any given spin polarization @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the changes in the equilibrium @xmath14 values due to polarization for bulk cs , k , na , li , ga , al , and for cs , na , al clusters using the sjm in the framework of local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",

    "the results show that in a closed - shell cluster with @xmath3 total electrons and polarization @xmath0 , the equilibrium ws radius @xmath20 is an increasing function of @xmath0 over the whole range @xmath4 whereas , for an open - shell cluster ( except for the two nearest neighbors of a closed - shell cluster ) , it has a decreasing behavior over @xmath5 , and an increasing behavior over @xmath21 . here",

    "also , the equilibrium @xmath14 values for a neutral cluster are found to be always smaller than that of the bulk metal with the same value of the polarization @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is due to the surface tension which is appreciable for small clusters . on the other hand , for an @xmath3 electron neutral cluster",
