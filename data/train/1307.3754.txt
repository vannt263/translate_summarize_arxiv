    "the venus atmosphere is a complex chemical system in permanent disequilibrium .",
    "some of the occurring reactions are exothermic and lead to excited - state products that radiate in the form of nightglow .",
    "the list of gases contributing to the venus nightglow includes o , o@xmath0 , no and oh , which produce emission features throughout the ultraviolet , visible and near - infrared spectrum @xcite .",
    "the herzberg ii system of o@xmath0 is one of such nightglow emissions , resulting from the radiative transition o@xmath0 @xmath2(0)@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath5)+@xmath6 between 350 and 700 nm .",
    "the emission was first detected at venus by the spectrometers on the venera 9 and 10 missions @xcite and assigned to the herzberg ii system soon after @xcite .",
    "typically , the emitting layer is @xmath71520 km thick and centered at 90100 km altitude .",
    "mean values for the overhead intensity are in the range of 23 kilorayleighs ( or about 50 times more in limb viewing through the layer center ) .",
    "the venera spectra did also contain the signature of the o@xmath0 chamberlain system , @xmath8(0)@xmath3@xmath9(@xmath10)+@xmath6 , the ratio of @xmath2@xmath4 to @xmath8@xmath9 intensities being about 15 to 1 @xcite .",
    "we refer to the joint emission from the @xmath2@xmath4 to @xmath8@xmath9 systems as the venus o@xmath0 visible nightglow .",
    "there is compelling evidence that the o@xmath0 nightglow @xcite , including the @xmath9(0)@xmath4(@xmath10= 0 , 1 ) bands at 1.27 and 1.58 @xmath1 m , respectively , arises from one or more o@xmath11 states excited in the three - body reaction : @xmath12 the oxygen atoms are produced by photodissociation of co@xmath0 on the planet s dayside and transported to the nightside by subsolar - to - antisolar winds in the upper atmosphere @xcite . in spite of decades of laboratory and planetary ( including earth and mars ) investigations , the understanding of the mechanisms that channel the o@xmath11 product(s ) from the reaction of eq .",
    "( [ termolecular_eq ] ) into the @xmath2(0 ) , @xmath8(0 ) and @xmath9(0 ) emitting states remains incomplete .",
    "indeed , it is remarkable that in the venus atmosphere the strong o@xmath0 @xmath9(0)@xmath4(0 ) emission at 1.27 @xmath1 m ( mean overhead intensity of about 1 mr at equatorial latitudes , dropping to @xmath70.2 mr at 6070@xmath13n , as reported by @xcite and supported in related work @xcite ) varies locally by more than an order of magnitude on time scales of hours ( especially in nadir viewing ) @xcite .",
    "however , reported intensities for the o@xmath0 visible nightglow ( mostly in limb viewing ) fall typically within a range of 23 from 150 kr @xcite .    in the current work ,",
    "we take a new look at the venus o@xmath0 visible nightglow by means of imagery of the planet s limb obtained with the venus monitoring camera ( vmc ) on venus express ( vex ) .",
    "the experiment is unique in that it provides snapshot observations over a baseline of nearly four years , longer than past space - based efforts ( namely , the venera 9 and 10 missions , and pioneer venus orbiter , pvo ) .",
    "unlike pvo , that used the on - board star tracker for monitoring the nightglow @xcite , vmc provides vertical resolution of the emitting layer .",
    "the emerging picture of the venus o@xmath0 visible nightglow resembles that of the o@xmath0 nightglow at 1.27 @xmath1 m .",
    "a few coincident observations of vmc and the visible and infrared thermal imaging spectrometer ( virtis , also on vex ) at 1.27 @xmath1 m support the conclusion .",
    "vmc sets a valuable reference for imaging the nightglow on planets other than earth .",
    "vmc is the wide - angle camera on vex @xcite",
    ". the vmc optical system projects a @xmath717.5@xmath13-field of view through four separate spectral channels onto the four quadrants of a ccd detector .",
    "the angular resolution is about 0.7 mrad / pixel , which translates into 2.3 - 5.5 km / pixel at the tangent point for limb viewing and spacecraft planetocentric distances of 7,00010,000 km .",
    "the visible filter is sensitive in the 500560 nm region , which means it is well suited for detection of the o@xmath0 @xmath2(0)@xmath4(@xmath10=9 , 10 ) bands .",
    "we considered the full public archive of vmc images in the visible channel , which goes from orbits 24 ( 15/05/2006 ) to 2099 ( 18/01/2012 ) .",
    "visual examination of the images including the planet s limb show a faint though distinct nightglow layer near 100 km altitude when the longest exposure times allowed for by the instrument ( 30 secs ) are utilized . from each image",
    ", we obtained 56 bins , each bin representing a local time / latitude region on the image , and the corresponding vertical emission profiles . for details on the navigation with the plia software @xcite and radiometric calibration , see the supplementary material .",
    "the vmc intensities quoted here refer to the full o@xmath0 @xmath2(0)@xmath4(@xmath10 ) progression in limb viewing .",
    "we produced a total of 515 bins from 117 images obtained over 38 orbits .",
    "the first and last orbits analyzed correspond to numbers 317 and 1716 in the vex numbering scheme , and date from 04/03/2007 and 01/01/2011 , respectively .",
    "solar activity in that period is low , with solar radio fluxes @xmath14=7090 .",
    "there are more images probing the northern hemisphere ( @xmath72/3 of the total ) , but overall both hemispheres are comparably well sampled . often , the images form sequences that probe significant areas of the planet s nightside in a single orbit . fig",
    "( i , top ) in the supplementary material displays six of those images , exploring the southern hemisphere before periapsis in orbit 1027 , whereas fig .",
    "( i , bottom ) shows the range of local times and latitudes probed over the sequence .",
    "figure ( ii ) in the supplementary material shows ( black symbols ) the local time and latitude at the tangent point for all bins .",
    "latitudes range from 60@xmath13s to 65@xmath13n and local times are largely ( but not exclusively ) within two hours from midnight .",
    "the red symbols are specific to instances of high nightglow emission .",
    "the green and blue symbols represent coincident vmc and virtis observations , respectively .",
    "these cases are discussed below .",
    "figure ( [ ivslati_fig ] ) shows vmc peak intensities against latitude at the tangent point .",
    "the mean limb - viewing intensity in the 20@xmath13s20@xmath13n range is @xmath7150 kr , which is reasonably consistent with the intensities found by the veneras ( @xmath7(1.53)@xmath1550=@xmath7(75150 ) kr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pvo ( @xmath7(1.55.7)@xmath1550=@xmath7(75285 ) kr , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and ground - based observations ( @xmath7(35)@xmath1550=@xmath7(150250 ) kr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for reference , the figure includes the average intensities from 90 to 100 km altitude for both the visible and near - infrared emissions as measured with virtis between january 2007 and may 2008 @xcite .",
    "the latter are scaled by an estimated ratio for the visible and near - infrared emissions of 1/200 .",
    "the virtis data conform to the canonical view that the o@xmath0 nightglow peaks near the antisolar point because the recombining oxygen atoms are transported from the dayside in the subsolar - to - antisolar circulation pattern @xcite .",
    "our interpretation of fig .",
    "( [ ivslati_fig ] ) is that the vmc intensities generally decay with latitude , a view that follows that for the averaged virtis data .",
    "the conclusion is more easily justified for the southern hemisphere , but is also consistent with a large number of the vmc measurements over the northern hemisphere .",
    "thus , the dispersion in the vmc intensities , particularly north of 40@xmath13n , likely reflects temporal and spatial variations , such as those known to occur at 1.27 @xmath1 m .",
    "a few brighter - than - average episodes are found in orbits 352 , 364 and 1286 ( see fig .",
    "ii , red symbols ) , having peak intensities that reach above 350 kr , which has an impact on the trend of vmc points in fig .",
    "( [ ivslati_fig ] ) .",
    "the lack of symmetry between the two hemispheres , even in the instances of moderate emission , may be caused by the different vertical resolution in the measurements north and south of the equator .",
    "the vex orbit imposes that the vmc spatial resolution at the limb improves as the spacecraft nears the northern polar latitudes , which leads to a progressive positive bias in the corresponding peak intensities .",
    "the optical axes of both the vmc and virtis instruments are aligned along the + z - axis of vex , which makes it possible to obtain simultaneous , co - located observations of the venus atmosphere .",
    "we identified four orbits ( 317 , 360 , 600 and 602 ) for which we can directly compare the o@xmath0 visible nightglow , as observed with vmc , and the o@xmath0 near - infrared nightglow , as observed with virtis .",
    "table ( [ virtis_table ] ) summarizes some relevant information about the vmc bins in those orbits .",
    "figure ( [ ipanel_fig ] ) shows the two sets of intensities against latitude , with green and blue symbols representing vmc and virtis data , respectively .",
    "local times and latitudes specific to the vmc and virtis observations in the four orbits are shown in fig .",
    "both sets of intensities appear reasonably consistent , especially where the two instruments probe overlapping regions ( i.e. , orbits 317 , 600 , 602 ) . orbit 602 exhibits moderate enhancements in the two emissions , when the vmc intensities reach 250300 kr .",
    "the comparison would obviously benefit from a longer record of simultaneous measurements , especially if conditions of high emission could be identified .",
    "figure ( [ profile_fig ] , left ) shows the emission vertical profiles for vmc and virtis data in a few selected examples from orbit 600 .",
    "the vmc profiles are visibly broader than the virtis ones , which likely results from three factors specific to vmc , namely its poorer spatial resolution ( the virtis instantaneous field of view is 2.5@xmath1510@xmath16 rad / pixel ) , the co - addition of vertical profiles obtained with relatively long exposure times , and a point spread function of a few pixels @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the accuracy in the absolute vertical scale of the vmc profiles and , thus , we have focused on the magnitudes of the emission peaks .",
    "uncertainty bars for the intensities are given for one vmc profile .",
    "they are calculated , at each altitude , as the standard deviation of the intensity from profiles that contribute to the bin .",
    "the uncertainty bars are affected by the three factors mentioned above , but they also provide a measure of the photon statistics and the spatial variability of the nightglow emission within the bin . the intensities and uncertainty bars shown in figs .",
    "( [ ivslati_fig])([ipanel_fig ] ) are specific to the altitude of peak emission .",
    "nightglow observations may be used for remotely sensing the atmospheric atomic oxygen . as a demonstration",
    ", we retrieved the atom number densities for the three vmc emission profiles in fig .",
    "( [ profile_fig ] , left ) with the energy - transfer parameters for excitation and quenching of the venus o@xmath0 visible nightglow derived by @xcite .",
    "the profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "( [ profile_fig ] , right ) , and show atomic oxygen number densities of 10@xmath1710@xmath18 @xmath19 at 100 km .",
    "such values are somewhat larger than , but in reasonable agreement with , the retrievals from the o@xmath0 nightglow at 1.27 @xmath1 m @xcite at the same altitude .",
    "the broad emission profiles lead to somewhat overestimated atomic oxygen number densities at the higher altitudes .",
    "the vmc observations analyzed here show that the o@xmath0 visible nightglow is a permanent feature of the venus nightside .",
    "the intensities seem to peak at low latitudes and drop polewards , which is consistent with past o@xmath0 visible and near - infrared nightglow observations with virtis @xcite .",
    "the nightglow is variable , as demonstrated by occasional high emission events .",
    "the main conclusion is that the o@xmath0 visible nightglow resembles the o@xmath0 nightglow at 1.27 @xmath1 m .",
    "this suggests , in turn , a direct correlation between the two , which is not unexpected since both emissions can ultimately be traced to the recombination reaction of eq .",
    "( [ termolecular_eq ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "we note the importance of the viewing geometry when comparing various measurements .",
    "most pre - vex observations of the o@xmath0 nightglow at 1.27 @xmath1 m came from nadir observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , pre - vex space - based observations of the o@xmath0 visible nightglow were typically conducted in limb viewing @xcite , which tends to smooth out localized features and therefore minimize changes .",
    "the tentative correlation may bear implications for the excitation of the atomic oxygen green line at 557.7 nm @xcite . by now , the green line has been detected several times , always from the ground @xcite , its intensity being permanently more than tenfold fainter than the 170 r of overhead intensity on the occasion of its discovery .",
    "we can not prove a connection between the o@xmath0 visible nightglow and the green line ( such a connection would hint at a mesospheric origin of the latter ) , and can not either explain why the overhead intensity for the o@xmath0 @xmath2@xmath4 system was relatively normal ( 5.1 kr , i.e. about 250 kr in limb viewing ) on the occasion of the venus green line discovery .",
    "however , it appears that the o@xmath0 visible nightglow may be as variable as the associated emission at 1.27 @xmath1 m .",
    "a usual objection for the green line originating in the mesosphere in the interaction with an energetic o@xmath0 precursor state is that the relatively energetic o@xmath0 @xmath2(0 ) state was considered to undergo little variability .",
    "the realisation that the o@xmath0 visible nightglow may be as variable as the near - infrared emission eliminates a fundamental impediment to a mesospheric origin of the atomic oxygen green line .",
    "the realisation , however , is not sufficient to prove a direct connection between the o@xmath0 and o nightglow emissions or to rule out the other mesospheric and ionospheric mechanisms for excitation of the green line proposed in recent years @xcite .",
