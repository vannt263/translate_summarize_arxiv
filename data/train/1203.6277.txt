    "during the last four decades there has been significant progress in our understanding of the world of elementary particles .",
    "the predictions of standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions developed in early 70 s are now confirmed by an enormous amount of experimental data . nowadays",
    ", highly sophisticated experiments like those performed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern intend to find the missing ingredient -the higgs field- to complete the anticipated picture of the sm .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , it was soon realised that the sm falls rather short for a complete and final theory of elementary particles and their fundamental forces . among other shortcomings ,",
    "the sm involves a large number of arbitrary parameters , while the gauge symmetry of the model is a product of gauge groups rather than a simple unified one .",
    "furthermore , gravity is not included , therefore the sm can not be considered a truly unified theory of all fundamental forces . however , from the extrapolation of the three sm gauge couplings there are hints indicating that they probably merge at a common mass scale at high energies and therefore it is expected that indeed , there is a larger symmetry , i.e. , a grand unified group ( for reviews see  @xcite ) with the sm gauge group incorporated in it .",
    "nevertheless , the sm alone can not account for this since it is plagued by quadratic divergences at large energies where the unification of couplings is expected .",
    "the large difference between the weak energy scale where the strong , and electroweak interactions are manifest ( of the order of 100 gev ) and the expected energy where they unify ( around @xmath1 gev ) , is known as the hierarchy problem .",
    "there is belief that these difficulties might be evaded if supersymmetry is introduced .",
    "there are significant theoretical reasons indicating that if supersymmetry ( for reviews see  @xcite ) is indeed the solution to the sm drawbacks , then it should be relevant at low scales accessible to present day experiments",
    ". the existence of superpartners will be checked at lhc in the forthcoming years .",
    "essential role in the theoretical developments and in particular the way supersymmetry is contributing to the solutions of the various theoretical issues , has been played by string theory according to which our world is  immersed \" in a ",
    "hyperspace \" consisting of ten space - time dimensions where six of them are compactified and extremely small to be observed .",
    "string theory reconciles in a nice way supersymmetry , grand unified symmetries and unification of gauge couplings at a high ( string ) scale . besides",
    ", quantization of gravity occurs naturally in the context of string theory since the ultraviolent infinities can be avoided .",
    "thus , one of the most important tasks is to embed the successful standard model of electroweak and strong interactions in a unified string derived model .",
    "the unification of all interactions can be realised in a quantum gravity theory free of anomalies . at present , the only candidate theory for this role is string theory .",
    "some two decades ago a major effort had been devoted to develop unified models in the context of heterotic string theory and there was a perception that it was the only one that includes the standard model .",
    "the great progress made in recent years has shown that other theories such as type i strings can also reproduce the standard model .",
    "one of the interesting features of type i string theory is that the scale where the theory leaves its trace could in principle be very low  @xcite , even at the order of a few tev , and therefore gives us the opportunity to solve the problem of hierarchy without requiring the existence of supersymmetry .",
    "additionally the low unification scenario allows the possibility to seek experimental evidence in appropriately designed experiments . in this scenario an important role is played by extensive solitonic - type objects that appear in the type i theory and are known as dp - branes  @xcite .",
    "our world could be localised on such a brane immersed in a higher dimensional space . in this scenario , known as brane - world scenario ,",
    "the interactions of the standard model are confined on the brane while the gravitational interactions are spread throughout the whole 10d space and this explains the fact that the gravitational interactions in four - dimensional world are weaker compared to other fundamental interactions .",
    "the last decade , considerable efforts were concentrated in model building and the fermion masses from intersecting d - brane configurations ( for related reviews see  @xcite ) embedded in a ten dimensional space . in effective field theory models emerging from intersecting d - branes , the matter fields",
    "are represented by strings attached on pairs of different d - brane stacks and they are localised at the intersections .",
    "the gauge symmetry of these constructions consists of gauge group factors @xmath2 , with matter accommodated in the various available bifundamental representations .",
    "hence , in this context , the standard model gauge group could naturally emerge from some appropriate d - brane configuration .",
    "since the various d - brane stacks span different dimensions of the ten dimensional space , the corresponding gauge couplings @xmath3 , depend on different world volumes and therefore they generally have different values .",
    "therefore , although there are many interesting features and success in the above approach , these models do not incorporate the anticipated gauge coupling unification in a natural way since there is no underlying symmetry that would force these couplings to be equal at the unification ( string ) scale .",
    "we note that it is possible to assume a d - brane set up with @xmath4 gauge group and @xmath5 type , whilst exceptional groups are absent .",
    "] , which contains all sm group factors in a single gauge symmetry and leads automatically to gauge coupling unification at the string scale .",
    "the main shortcoming of this possibility however , -in the context of intersecting d branes- is the absence of the tree level perturbative yukawa coupling @xmath6 to provide fermion masses .",
    "we will see how these issues are resolved in the context of f - theory models .",
    "work done during the last few years provides convincing evidence that the above drawbacks can be evaded when the desired grand unified theory symmetries ( guts ) are realised in f - theory@xcite compactified on calabi - yau fourfolds .",
    "recent progress in f - theory model building  @xcite-@xcite has shown that old successful guts including the su(5 ) , so(10 ) models etc , are naturally realised on the world - volume of non - perturbative seven branes wrapping appropriate compact surfaces .",
    "the rather interesting fact in f - theory constructions is that because they are defined on a compact elliptically fibered calabi - yau complex four dimensional manifold the exceptional groups @xmath7 , can be naturally incorporated into the theory too  @xcite .",
    "although exceptional gauge symmetries suffer from several drawbacks when realised in the context of four - dimensional grand unified theories , in the case of f - theory models they are more promising as new possibilities arise for the symmetry breaking mechanisms and the derivation of the desired massless spectrum .",
    "present studies have led to remarkable progress on model building in f - theory  @xcite-@xcite with a considerable amount of them focusing on three generation @xmath0-gut models .",
    "the vital issues of proton decay , the higgs mixing term and the fermion mass structure require the computation of yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "f - model building gave rise to some interesting mechanisms to generate yukawa hierarchy either with the use of fluxes  @xcite and the notion of t - branes  @xcite or with the implementation of the froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite . in  @xcite ( and further in  @xcite ) it is shown that when three - form fluxes are turned on in f - theory compactifications , rank - one fermion mass matrices receive corrections , leading to masses for lighter generations and ckm mixing .",
    "flipped @xmath0  @xcite , as well as some examples of @xmath8 f - theory models  @xcite were also considered .",
    "many of these models predict exotic states below the unification scale , and the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of gauge coupling unification including the effect of such states and flux effects has been discussed in a series of papers @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other phenomenological issues such as neutrinos from kk - modes@xcite , proton decay @xcite and the origin of cp violation  @xcite have also been discussed . a systematic classification of semi - local f - theory guts arising from a single @xmath9 point of local enhancement , leading to simple gut groups based on @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath0 on the del pezzo surface has been presented in  @xcite . here",
    "i focus on some phenomenological aspects of effective f - theory models mainly with @xmath0 symmetry . to make this presentation self - contained in the next section i review in brief the basics of f - theory and elliptic fibration .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the methodology of f - theory model building . in section 5",
    "the spectral cover approach is reviewed whilst the remaining sections deal with various phenomenological issues of specific examples in the context of @xmath0 models .",
    "we start with a short description of the salient features of f - theory and f - theory model building following mainly the works of  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "f - theory can be considered as a 12-dimensional theory which arises from the geometrization of the type iib 10-dimensional string theory .",
    "the effective theory is described by the type iib supergravity whose bosonic field content contains the metric @xmath11 the dilaton field @xmath12 and the @xmath13-form potentials @xmath14 which imply the corresponding field strengths @xmath15 .",
    "an important observation is that when @xmath13-form magnetic fluxes are turned on in the internal manifold , new string vacua may appear and a tree - level moduli potential will be generated .",
    "further , there are two scalars contained in the aforementioned bosonic spectrum , namely @xmath16 and @xmath12 which can be combined into a complex modulus = c_0+e^-c_0+[modulus ] in addition , it is convenient to define the field combinations g_3&=&f_3-h_3 + f_5&=&f_5 - 12 g_2h_3 - 12 b_2f_3[5f ] the 5-form field defined in ( [ 5f ] ) has to obey the selfduality condition @xmath17 where @xmath18 stands for the hodge star . with these ingredients",
    "one can write an action leading to the correct equations of motion  @xcite @xmath19 the action is invariant under the following @xmath20 duality transformations & & + (    ch + f    ) & & (    ccd&c + b&a    ) (    ch + f    ) together with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this action looks like it has been obtained from a compactified 12-dimensional theory on a torus with modulus @xmath23 defined in ( [ modulus ] ) .",
    "the @xmath24 fields appear in @xmath25 as if they have been obtained from a 12-d field strength @xmath26 reduced along the two radii of the torus . in f - theory @xmath23",
    "is interpreted as the complex structure modulus of an elliptic curve generating a complex fourfold which constitutes the elliptic fibration over the cy threefold .",
    "since the fibration relies on the @xmath27 , this means that the gauge coupling is not a constant and the resulting compactification is not perturbative .",
    "hence , according to the above picture , f - theory@xcite is defined on a background @xmath28 with @xmath29 our usual space - time and @xmath30 an elliptically fibered calabi - yau ( cy ) complex fourfold with a section over a complex three - fold base @xmath31 .    in  @xcite a specific example",
    "was presented where there is an equivalence between f - theory compactifications on a k3 surface and the heterotic theory compactification on @xmath32 .",
    "a k3 surface is a complex smooth regular manifold with trivial canonical bundle .",
    "the general elliptically fibered k3 is described by the weierstrass equation & = & x^3 + f(z , w ) xu^4+g(z , w)u^6[wei0 ] where @xmath33 are parameters of the fibration and @xmath34 homogeneous polynomials of degree 8 and 12 respectively .",
    "the equation is invariant under the following two rescalings @xmath35 indeed , for the first rescaling the left hand side becomes @xmath36 and the same weight emerges for the right hand side of ( [ wei0 ] ) .",
    "similarly , one finds that for the second rescaling from both terms of the equation a weight @xmath37 is factored out .",
    "there are five coordinates compared to two rescalings and one equation , thus the equation describes a two complex dimensional surface . for the first rescaling we observe that the sum of the weights is @xmath38 , i.e. equal to the weight 12 , and the second is @xmath39 is equal to the weight of the second equivalent equation .",
    "therefore , this is a cy manifold .    fixing @xmath40 the above equation becomes y^2&=&x^3+f(z)x+g(z)[wei1 ] we now observe that @xmath41 transform as sections @xmath42 .",
    "this can be understood if we assign the scalings @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 so that ( [ wei1 ] ) becomes @xmath45 implying @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the functions @xmath48 now are considered 8 and 12 degree polynomials in @xmath49 . for each point of the base , the equation describes a torus labeled by the coordinate @xmath49 .",
    "( to get an intuition , note that fixing @xmath41 to be real numbers , ( [ wei0 ] ) reduces to elliptic curves , see fig.[xxx ] ) .",
    "the modular parameter of the torus is related to the functions @xmath41 through the @xmath20 modular invariant function @xmath50 j()&=&[modf ] where j()&=&e^-2i+744+o(e^2i ) the curve described by ( [ wei0 ] ) is non - singular provided that the discriminant & = & 4 f^3 + 27 g^2[discr ] in non - zero . at the zero loci of the discriminant @xmath51 , (",
    "i.e. , at @xmath52 ) the elliptic curve becomes singular with one cycle shrinking to zero size and the fiber degenerates where @xmath53 are the divisors of @xmath31 and @xmath54 represent their multiplicities .",
    "the singularities of the cy 4-fold are developed along the divisors with @xmath55 . ] .",
    "there are 24 zeros @xmath56 of the discriminant which are in general distinct and different from the zeros of @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to 24 7-branes located at @xmath57 . in the vicinity of such a point using ( [ modf ] ) and ( [ discr ] ) we have j((z))~&&(z)(z - z_i ) up to @xmath20 transformations . in the limit @xmath58",
    ", we observe that @xmath59 and since @xmath60 this means that we are in the weak coupling regime since @xmath61 .",
    "further , since @xmath62 , performing a complete rotation around @xmath56 , @xmath23 undergoes a monodromy @xmath63 , or equivalently @xmath64 this implies the existence of a 7-brane at @xmath56 , while totally there are 24 such branes in the compact transverse space .",
    "however , since the space is compact the sum @xmath65 must vanish .",
    "further considerations along these lines lead to the conclusion that f - theory is strongly coupled .",
    "there are limiting cases however where f - theory has a perturbative expansion . indeed , suppose that @xmath66 is constant which can be satisfied by assuming that  @xcite @xmath67 substituting one finds @xmath68 which gives a weak coupling regime everywhere on the base for @xmath69 i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "we discuss now how this geometric picture is associated to the gauge group structure and the spectrum of an effective low energy theory model .",
    "recall first that in intersecting d - brane constructions non - abelian gauge symmetries emerge when more than one d - branes coincide . while a single d - brane is associated to a @xmath71 symmetry ,",
    "when @xmath72 of @xmath73 branes coincide the gauge group becomes @xmath74 . in f - theory",
    "when d7 branes coincide at certain point , then at this point there is a singularity of the elliptic fibration .",
    "the _ singularities _ of the manifold are classified with respect to the vanishing order of the polynomials @xmath75 and the zeros of the discriminant @xmath51 .",
    "they determine the _ gauge group _ and _ the matter content _ of the _ f - theory _ compactification . by adjusting the coefficients of the polynomials",
    "@xmath41 we can obtain @xmath76 types of gauge groups .",
    "( only two dimensions are shown ) .",
    "every point of @xmath31 is represented by a torus with modulus @xmath27 .",
    "red points represent 7-branes , orthogonal to @xmath31 .",
    "the torus degenerates at these ` points ' ( vanishing cycle ) .",
    "going around the non - trivial cycle , the vanishing cycle undergoes monodromy . ]      according to the interpretation above , in f - theory the gauge symmetry is associated to the singularities of the internal compact manifold .",
    "a systematic analysis of these singularities has started with the work of kodaira  @xcite .",
    "given the form of the weierstrass equation @xmath77 the kodaira classification relies on the vanishing order of the polynomials @xmath41 and the discriminant @xmath51 .",
    "this is summarised in table  [ t_k ] .",
    "a useful tool for the analysis of the gauge properties of an f - theory gut is tate s algorithm  @xcite  .",
    "tate s algorithm gives an algorithmic procedure to describe the singularities of the elliptic fiber and determine the local properties of the associated gauge group .",
    "we follow  @xcite to sketch how this analysis works for a few simple cases .",
    "we assume a small set @xmath78 of the base and that the restriction @xmath79 will have a defining equation @xmath80 . in this patch",
    "we expand the coefficients of the weierstrass equation in powers of @xmath49 @xmath81    .kodaira s classification of elliptic singularities [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model is consistent with a gauge coupling unification at a scale @xmath82 gev . in the simplest case ,",
    "the sm gauge symmetry is embedded in the @xmath0 gut with the sm matter content incorporated into @xmath0 multiplets . however , in a string derived @xmath0 model , one must confront the mismatch between @xmath83 and the natural gravitational scale @xmath84 gev .",
    "we have pointed out earlier , that in f - theory it is possible to decouple gauge dynamics from gravity by restricting to compact surfaces @xmath85 that are of del pezzo type .",
    "the exact determination of the gut scale however , may depend on the spectrum and other details of the chosen gauge symmetry and on the particular model . in f - theory @xmath0",
    "we are examining here , there are several sources of threshold effects that have to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "thus , we encounter thresholds related to the flux mechanism which induce splitting of the gauge couplings at the gut scale  @xcite . a second source concerns threshold corrections generated from heavy kk massive modes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , corrections to gauge coupling running arise due to the appearance of probe d3-branes generically present in f - theory compactifations and filling the @xmath86 non - compact dimensions while sitting at certain points of the internal manifold  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on two sources of thresholds , namely the ones induced by fluxes and those by kk - modes .",
    "thresholds induced by the flux mechanism have been extensively analysed in recent literature  @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the @xmath87-flux induced splitting is compatible with the gut embedding of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , provided that no extra matter other than color triplets is present in the spectrum .",
    "thresholds originating from kk - massive modes have been discussed in  @xcite and were found to be related to a topologically invariant quantity , the ray - singer analytic torsion  @xcite . in f - theory , kk - massive modes exist for both the gauge and the matter fields . taking also into account that several low energy effective models involve exotics in the light spectrum , it is possible that they might threaten the gauge coupling unification . here it will be argued that under reasonable assumptions for the matter curve bundle structure , in a class of @xmath0 models the kk - massive modes do not have any effect on the unification@xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may implement the requirement of unification to constrain thresholds from kk modes of @xmath0 gauge and matter field  @xcite .",
    "we start with the @xmath0 gauge multiplet under ( [ 24ri ] ) and recall the fact that the massless exotics @xmath88 have been eliminated by imposing the condition @xmath89 ( see eq .",
    "[ noexotic ] ) . at the one - loop level",
    "we write [ gauge ] = + b_a+_a^(g),a=3,2,yhere @xmath90 is the gauge theory cutoff scale , @xmath91 are the normalization coefficients for the usual embedding of the standard model into @xmath0 , @xmath92 is the value of the gauge coupling at the high scale , and @xmath93 the one - loop @xmath94-function coefficients . the massive modes in representations ( [ 24ri ] )",
    "induce threshold effects to the running of the gauge couplings denoted by @xmath95 .",
    "these can be written  @xcite in terms of the ray - singer torsion @xmath96 @xmath97 we absorb the term proportional to @xmath98 into a redefinition of @xmath99 while the remaining part suggests that we can define @xmath83 as  @xcite @xmath100 here we have associated the world volume factor @xmath101 with the characteristic f - theory compactification scale @xmath102 .",
    "next we will consider contributions arising from chiral matter and the higgs fields transforming under the standard @xmath103 and @xmath104 non - trivial representations .",
    "we should mention that the @xmath87-flux introduced in order to break @xmath0 might eventually lead to incomplete @xmath0 representations , spoiling thus the gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , in the previous sections we have already discussed realistic cases where the matter fields add up to complete @xmath0 multiplets , so that the @xmath105-functions contribute in proportion to the coefficients @xmath98 . under the above assumptions ,",
    "we may write threshold terms for the kk - states leaving in ( [ 105split ] ) representations as follows  @xcite s_a^|5&=&-_a(t_-1/2-t_1/3)+k_a ( 2_-1/2 ) [ tc5 ] + s_a^10&=&+_a(t_-2/3-t_1/6)+k_a(6_1/6 ) [ tc10]with @xmath106 while @xmath107 is the torsion and the indices refer to hypercharges .",
    "we now observe that the hypercharge differences not proportional to @xmath98 in both @xmath108 and @xmath109 satisfy the same condition @xmath110 . given this property and the fact that the torsion is a topologically invariant quantity",
    ", one could assume the existence of bundle structures for @xmath108 and @xmath109 so that the above differences vanish .",
    "then , only the terms proportional to @xmath98 remain which can be absorbed in a redefinition of the gauge coupling at @xmath83 .",
    "we will assume that matter resides on at most genus one ( @xmath111 ) matter curves ( see example discussed in section 4.1 as well as in  @xcite ) with chiral matter forming complete @xmath0 multiplets .",
    "for @xmath111 in particular , according to ray - singer@xcite , the analytic torsion is _ v_z = u - v&=&|| [ tr1 ] for @xmath112 , making use of known theta - function identities we observe _",
    "v-1_z = u-(v-1)&=&||= t_z = u - v[tr2 ] in order to use this result , we need to make a proper identification of the hypercharge @xmath113 .",
    "considering now two successive hypercharge values @xmath114 such that @xmath115 and using the association v_i&= & [ yv ] we get the identification @xmath116 with this embedding we can easily see that the differences @xmath117 and @xmath118 so that threshold corrections vanish and unification is retained .",
    "thus , adding matter contributions of complete @xmath0 representations to ( [ gauge ] ) , while assuming that the higgs - triplet pair decouples at @xmath119 we finally get @xmath120 where @xmath121 mssm beta functions with and without the triplet - pair contribution and the gut value of the gauge @xmath122 coupling is related to the string @xmath92 coupling by @xmath123",
    "in the previous sections we have presented techniques for the construction of f - theory @xmath0 models and analysed ways and novel mechanisms for symmetry breaking and doublet triplet splitting . in f - theory ,",
    "important properties of the effective field theory model depend on the specific geometry of the compact space and the internal fluxes .",
    "thus , we have investigated how the triplet - doublet splitting problem for example can be solved by judicious choice of fluxes in order to split the @xmath0 higgs fiveplets  @xcite .",
    "several other important issues of gut models have been successfully treated in their f - theory analogues .",
    "thus , it has been suggested  @xcite that unwanted proton decay operators can be avoided through the incorporation of an r - symmetry by invoking symmetries of the manifold and of the fluxes  @xcite .",
    "alternative ways have also been presented based on the abelian factors  @xcite and the extension of the @xmath0 gauge group to flipped @xmath124 discussed in the previous section .",
    "further progress has also been made towards the computation of the yukawa couplings and the determination of the fermion mass spectrum@xcite .",
    "we have already explained that in f - theory chiral matter is localised along the intersections of the surface @xmath85 with other 7-branes , while yukawa couplings are formed when three of these curves intersect at a single point on @xmath85 .",
    "their computation relies on the knowledge of the profile of the wavefunctions of the states participating in the intersection .",
    "when a specific geometry is chosen for the internal space ( and in particular for the gut surface ) these profiles are found by solving the corresponding equations of motion  @xcite . besides , the precise knowledge of the common gauge coupling value at the gut scale is crucial for the determination of the yukawa couplings involved in the calculation of the fermion mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "then , their values are obtained by computing the integral of the overlapping wavefunctions at the triple intersections . despite this important success towards a reliable computation of undetermined parameters of guts and the standard model , yet a lot of work",
    "is required to formulate a complete picture of an f - theory derived effective low energy model ; because a theory , no matter how beautiful it is , has to face the relentless test of the experimental proof .",
