    "the steady states of self gravitating fluid in three dimensions have been studied by a long list of illustrious mathematical physicists .",
    "( for an extensive list of references see [ 1,2,3 ] ) .",
    "the motivation for this research was due to the interest in the shape , stability and evolution of celestial bodies and systems[12 ] .",
    "we now know however that many celestial objects such as galaxies and our solar system exhibit ( effectively ) `` two dimensional structure '' [ 4,5,6,7 ] . furthermore recent discoveries are leading us to believe that systems similar to our solar system are `` abundant '' in the galaxy and their existence might be due to the collapse of a two dimensional interstellar cloud under gravitation ( this is the so called the `` nebular theory '' ) [ 8,9,10,11,17 ] .",
    "this data leads us to believe that there is a fundamental physical process which we do not understand fully as yet that leads to the formation of planetary systems throughout the galaxy ( and beyond ) .",
    "this background motivates us to investigate in this paper the steady states and time - dependent evolution of a self gravitating and rotating fluid in two dimensions .",
    "this problem has been explored by a large number of investigators using elaborate analytic methods and computer simulations which involve , in general , thermodynamic considerations , magnetohydrodynamics modeling and turbulence.(for a complete list of references see [ 8,9,10,13,16 ] ) . while these are important issues we still need , in our opinion , prototype analytic models that are able to capture the evolution of this process and lead to insights about its possible outcomes .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to develop such a model using the basic hydrodynamic equations that govern the time - dependent evolution of an isothermal , incompressible , stratified ( i.e non constant density ) and rotating fluid in two dimensions under gravity [ 1,2,3 ] .",
    "( the justification for the reduction from three to two dimensions has been discussed by many authors .",
    "a lucid treatment is given in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] pp.1 - 12).under these assumptions we show that the number of model equations can be reduced from five to a system of two equations for the steady states and three coupled equations for its evolution .",
    "the models contain some `` parameter functions '' which encode information about the asymptotic mass density distribution of the fluid and its momentum .",
    "the steady state model was investigated by us previously.[18,19,20 ] however in this paper we consider a more general model in which the `` gas cloud '' is rotating also with uniform angular velocity @xmath0 and study the impact of this rotation on the matter distribution in the steady state .",
    "to study the predictions of these models we use both analytical and numerical methods to solve their equations under a variety of conditions .",
    "in particular we consider radial solutions to these equations which represent the evolution of an interstellar cloud with isothermal equation of state [ 10 ] .",
    "it might be argued that the hydrodynamic assumptions we are making in this paper are not realistic from astrophysical point of view .",
    "however our main goal is to capture analytically , as far as possible , the nonlinear and time dependent aspects of the processes under consideration .",
    "accordingly our results might be useful to provide some analytic insights and guidelines for more elaborate work on this topic .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec 2 we present the basic hydrodynamic equations and show how one can reduce them to a coupled system of three equations .",
    "sec 3 presents further simplifications of these equations .",
    "the first is for the steady states of the model .",
    "the second is for the time dependent evolution of the gas cloud under the assumption of constant vorticity . in sec 4",
    "we present analytical and numerical radial solutions of these equations .",
    "we end up sec 5 with summary and conclusions .",
    "following the standard convention [ 1,14,15 ] we model the time dependent non - relativistic flow of an incompressible fluid in two dimensions @xmath1 by the hydrodynamic equations of inviscid and incompressible stratified fluid @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6    where subscripts indicate differentiation with respect to the indicated variable , @xmath7 is the fluid velocity , @xmath8 is its density , @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 is the gravitational field and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "the terms @xmath11 , @xmath12 represent the components of the apparent centrifugal force due to the rotation of the gas cloud with angular velocity @xmath0 .",
    "we can nondimensionalize these equations by introducing the following scalings @xmath13 where @xmath14 are some characteristic length , velocity and mass density respectively that characterize the problem at hand . substituting these scalings in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1])-([2.5 ] ) and dropping the tildes these equations remain unchanged ( but the quantities that appear in these equations become nondimensional ) while @xmath15 is replaced by @xmath16 .",
    "( once again we drop the tilde ) .    in view of eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) we can introduce a stream function @xmath17 so that @xmath18    using this stream function we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) as [ 13,15 ] @xmath19 where for any two ( smooth ) functions @xmath20 @xmath21    using @xmath17 the momentum equations ( [ 2.3]),([2.4 ] ) become @xmath22 @xmath23 to eliminate @xmath9 from these equations we differentiate eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ 2.11 ] ) with respect to @xmath24 respectively and subtract .",
    "this leads to @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the sum of the second and fourth terms in this equation can be rewritten as @xmath27    to reduce the first and third terms in ( [ 2.12 ] ) we use ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath28 combining the results of ( [ 2.13 ] ) and ( [ 2.14 ] ) eq .",
    "( [ 2.12 ] ) becomes @xmath29 thus we have reduced the original five equations ( [ 2.1])-([2.5 ] ) to three equations ( [ 2.5 ] ) , ( [ 2.8 ] ) and ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "although ( [ 2.15 ] ) is rather cumbersome in general , it can simplified further under some restrictions which are presented in the following section .",
    "equation ( [ 2.15 ] ) can be simplified further in two cases .",
    "the first is when we consider only steady states of the flow and the second is when the flow vorticity is constant .      when we consider only steady states of the flow ( [ 2.8 ] ) implies that @xmath30 and after some algebra [ 18 ] ( [ 2.15 ] ) reduces to @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is some function of @xmath8 .",
    "thus the equations governing the steady state are ( [ 4.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.5 ] ) and @xmath34 and @xmath33 are `` parameter functions '' which determine the nature of the steady state .",
    "the function @xmath34 is a parameter function which is determined by the momentum ( and angular momentum ) distribution in the fluid . from a practical point of view",
    "the choice of this function determines the structure of the steady state density distribution .",
    "the corresponding flow field can be computed then aposteriori ( that is after solving for @xmath8 ) from the following relations.[18 ] @xmath35    the function @xmath33 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) can be determined from the asymptotic values of @xmath8 and @xmath10 on the boundaries of the domain on which eqs ( [ 2.5]),([4.1 ] ) are solved .",
    "when these asymptotic values are imposed or known one can evaluate the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) on the domain boundaries and re - express it in terms of @xmath8 only to determine @xmath33 on the boundary of the domain . however , the resulting functional relationship of @xmath36 on @xmath8 must then hold also within the domain itself since @xmath36 does not depend on x , y directly .",
    "for example if we assume that on an infinite domain @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath39 then ( asymptotically ) ( [ 4.1 ] ) evaluates to @xmath40      to begin with we consider the case where the vorticity is zero and then generalize to the case where the flow vorticity is constant .    when the flow vorticity @xmath41 is zero then @xmath42 eq . (",
    "[ 2.15 ] ) becomes @xmath43 however when the vorticity is zero we can introduce the velocity potential @xmath44 which satisfies @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",

    "when we consider the special case where in polar coordinates @xmath64 and @xmath65 the system ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.5 ] ) with @xmath66 reduces to @xmath67 @xmath68 to solve this system of equations we let @xmath69 , solve ( [ 4.2 ] ) for @xmath10 and substitute the result in ( [ 4.3 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following fourth order equation for @xmath8 @xmath70 the general solution of this equation is @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are bessel functions of the first and second kind of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 assuming no singularity at the origin we set @xmath76 . to assess the impact of the rotation term on the steady state we solved this system for @xmath77 on a circular disk using the boundary conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the results of these computations for different values of @xmath0 are plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath82 . in this figure",
    "we see that the separation between the density peaks become more pronounced as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this might interpreted as leading to the creation of protoplanets around the central core .    a strong dependence on @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath83 which has the same parameters as fig .",
    "@xmath82 except that the boundary conditions on @xmath8 are : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this figure illustrate clearly the effect that rotation can have on the pattern of density fluctuations within the cloud .",
    "furthermore in this figure the magnitude of the density fluctuations reverses itself as @xmath0 becomes larger viz .",
    "the higher density peaks are placed at larger values of @xmath86 .",
    "( which is reminiscent of the situation in the solar system )",
    "the system ( [ 2.5]),([2.18 ] ) and ( [ 2.19 ] ) can be simplified further if we use polar coordinates and assume that @xmath87 are functions of @xmath86 and @xmath88 only .",
    "we obtain , @xmath89 where @xmath90 .      when we consider a steady state solutions of ( [ 2.28 ] )",
    "then @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "@xmath8 is constant and we can let @xmath95 without loss of generality .",

    "we consider these two cases separately .",

    "however we present here analytical solutions of this equation for two special cases .",
    "1 .   @xmath69 where @xmath105 is a constant .",
    "the solution to ( [ 2.29 ] ) in this case is @xmath106 it follows then that the nature of the steady state is determined by the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "a sample of the resulting @xmath8 profiles is presented in @xmath108 . to obtain this figure we considered a pinched disk with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting steady state has an increase in the material density towards the circumference of the disk .",
