    "recently , spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in optical potentials have received much attention in both experimental stenger , anderson , liu and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "spinor becs have internal degrees of freedom due to the hyperfine spin of the atoms which liberate a rich variety of phenomena such as spin domains @xcite and textures @xcite",
    ". when the potential valley is so deep that the individual sites are mutually independent , spinor becs at each lattice site behave like spin magnets and can interact with each other through both the light - induced and the static , magnetic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these site - to - site dipolar interactions can cause the ferromagnetic phase transition @xcite leading to a macroscopic  magnetization of the condensate array and the spin - wave like excitation @xcite analogous to the spin - wave in a ferromagnetic spin chain . for the real spin chain ,",
    "the site - to - site interaction is caused mainly by the exchange interaction , while the dipole - dipole interaction is negligibly small .",
    "for the spinor becs in the optical lattice , the exchange interaction is absent .",
    "the individual spin magnets are coupled by the magnetic and the light - induced dipole - dipole interactions @xcite which are no longer negligible due to the large number of atoms @xmath0 at each lattice site , typically of the order of 1000 or more .",
    "therefore , the spinor becs in an optical lattice offer a totally new environment to study spin dynamics in periodic structures .",
    "the magnetic soliton excited by the interaction between the spin waves @xcite is an important and interesting phenomenon in spinor becs . in this paper , we demonstrate that the magnetic soliton and elastic soliton collision are admitted for spinor becs in a one - dimensional optical lattice and are controllable by adjusting of the light - induced and the magnetic dipole - dipole interactions .    the heisenberg model of spin - spin interactions is considered as the starting point for understanding many complex magnetic structures in solids . in particular , it explains the existence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism at temperatures below the curie temperature .",
    "the magnetic soliton @xcite , which describes localized magnetization , is an important excitation in the heisenberg spin chain tjon , li , ablowitz , huang .",
    "the haldane gap @xcite of antiferromagnets has been reported in integer heisenberg spin chain . by means of the neutron inelastic scattering @xcite and electron spin resonance asano00 ,",
    "the magnetic soliton has already been probed experimentally in quasi - one dimensional magnetic systems .",
    "solitons can travel over long distances with neither attenuation nor change of shape , since the dispersion is compensated by nonlinear effects .",
    "the study of soliton has been conducted in as diverse fields as particle physics , molecular biology , geology , oceanography , astrophysics , and nonlinear optics .",
    "perhaps the most prominent application of solitons is in high - rate telecommunications with optical fibers .",
