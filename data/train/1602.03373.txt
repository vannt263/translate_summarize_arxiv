    "understanding the physical mechanisms leading to heating of the solar atmosphere is one of the primary questions in solar physics and a long - standing puzzle . in recent years , the importance of partial ionization for the processes in solar plasma is becoming clear .",
    "it has been shown that the current dissipation enhanced in the presence of neutrals in the plasma not entirely coupled by collisions can be essential for the energy balance of the chromosphere @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "it was shown how the dissipation of static currents in non - current - free solar magnetic flux tubes allows to release a large amount of energy into the chromosphere , potentially able to compensate its radiative losses , @xcite .",
    "solar atmosphere is far from stationary .",
    "it is filled with waves and rapidly varying flows , and pierced by dynamic magnetic structures , originating in the solar interior .",
    "as it has been demonstrated @xcite , the magnetized plasma motions in the solar photosphere create an electromagnetic ( poynting ) energy flux sufficient to heat the upper solar atmosphere .",
    "a significant part of this flux is produced in the form of alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "these waves are notoriously difficult to dissipate if an ideal plasma assumption is employed .    in the present study",
    "we extend the analysis by @xcite including time - dependent oscillatory perturbations . magnetic waves ( fast magneto - acoustic and alfvn waves )",
    "produce perturbations in the magnetic field .",
    "these perturbations create currents at all times and locations in the magnetised solar atmosphere . similarly to static currents , the currents produced by waves in a partially ionized magnetised chromosphere can be efficiently dissipated due to the presence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this would provide a constant and efficient influx of energy into the chromospheric layers .",
    "it was long known that the presence of neutral atoms in partially ionized plasmas significantly affects excitation and propagation of waves @xcite . the relative motion between the ionized and charged species causes an increase of collisional damping of mhd waves in the photosphere , chromosphere and prominence plasmas , in a similar way that any electro - magnetic wave is dissipated in a collisional medium .",
    "these mechanisms were investigated for high - frequency waves and were shown to be important for frequencies close to the collisional frequency between the different species @xcite . in the cited works the damping was analyzed in terms of the damping time of waves .",
    "here we study the energy input due to this damping .",
    "in the solar chromosphere the collisional coupling of the plasma is still strong @xcite . in this case , it is convenient to use a single - fluid quasi - mhd approach i.e , including non - ideal terms not taken into account by the ideal mhd approximation instead of solving full multi - fluid equations .",

    "this system of equations is closed by the generalized ohm s law , where we only include ohmic and ambipolar terms : @xmath5 =   \\eta\\vec{j }   - \\eta_a\\frac{[(\\vec{j } \\times \\vec{b } ) \\times \\vec{b}]}{|b|^2}\\ ] ] with resistivity coefficients ( in units of @xmath6 ) defined as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 in these equations the inter - species collision frequencies @xmath10 are those between electrons and ions of the specie @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , between electrons and neutrals of the specie @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and those between ions and neutrals of different species ( @xmath15 ) . these frequencies ,",

    "we do not include the rest of the terms in the generalized ohm s law as these terms either do not contribute to the energy balance , as hall term , or can be considered small for the solar atmospheric conditions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the battery term can potentially increase the current and , therefore , the dissipation , as it was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "finally , the induction equation reads as : @xmath19}{|b|^2 }   \\right].\\ ] ]    the physical magnitude of @xmath20 is too small to produce a measurable effect .",
    "we used a numerical analog of the @xmath20 , denoted as @xmath21 ( hyperdiffusion ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 is allowed to vary in space and time according to the structures developed in the simulations , so that it reaches larger values at places where the variations are small - scale @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 , together with the grid resolution , defines the maximum reynolds number of the simulations .",
    "the effective magnetic reynolds number due to @xmath21 in the simulation presented in this paper ( as computed directly from the derivatives of physical quantities entering its definition ) varies between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with the smallest values localised in narrow layers at the regions where the gradients are strongest , i.e. at the shocks .",
    "@xmath24 , however , can reach values significantly larger than @xmath21 decreasing the effective _ physical _ magnetic reynolds number to @xmath25 in the layers above 1200 km , where @xmath24 is large .    the equations above are solved by means of the code mancha @xcite .",
    "we evolve @xmath17 in time via the saha equation .",

    "this choice allows to avoid negative values of gas pressure within the magnetic flux tube , while keeping plasma-@xmath31 low .",

    "the bottom boundary of the simulation box is located in the deep photosphere .",
    "the parameters of the magnetic field are chosen such that the magnetic field strength at the axis of the magnetic flux tube is @xmath34 at the bottom ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 at the top ( @xmath37 ) of the domain .",
    "this leads to the plasma @xmath38 height of about @xmath39 at the axis of the tube .",
    "self - consistent periodic perturbations of the velocity vector , pressure , and density are introduced according to @xcite . for the simulations described here we used the driving frequency of @xmath40 mhz .",
    "the choice of the driving frequency was motivated by the results of @xcite who showed that alfvn waves with such periods can be generated in intergranular magnetic flux tubes by turbulent convective motions . to break the symmetry ,",
    "the acoustic pulse was placed at @xmath41 off the flux tube axis in the field - free atmosphere and was limited in horizontal extent by a gaussian of @xmath41 fwhm .",

    "the duration of the simulation was @xmath42 .        in order to understand the effect of plasma oscillations on chromospheric heating ,",

    ", we include the ambipolar term as a perturbation .",
    "this case is analogous to @xcite . in the second run ( denoted as @xmath44 ) , we include only the wave driving , with no ambipolar term . in the third run ( denoted as @xmath45 ) ,",
    "we include both the wave driving and the ambipolar diffusion term . in the @xmath43 run , the ambipolar term alone acting on a static flux tube produces dissipation of its static currents , which creates perturbations in all thermodynamical parameters and , in particular , in temperature . in the @xmath45 case ,",
    "both wave and ambipolar drivings produce variations of temperature and therefore it is difficult to separate the effects of waves from the effect of static current dissipation . for that we perform a flatfield - like procedure . in order to determine the heating caused by the current dissipation of the currents produced only by the waves , we subtract from @xmath45 case the heating produced in the @xmath43 case , as well as the variations due to waves produced in the @xmath44 case .",
    "the acoustic pulse set in the field - free atmosphere generates essentially acoustic ( fast ) waves .",
    "these waves gradually enter the flux tube , cross the @xmath46 level and generate fast and slow magneto - acoustic waves and alfvn waves via the mode transformation .",
    "the latter waves propagate in the magnetic flux tube and create perpendicular currents , which then dissipate due to ion - neutral friction ( see fig .  [ fig:3dview ] ) .",
    "this process is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ambiheating ] , where the logarithm of the ambipolar diffusion heating term @xmath47 is shown . in the first column ,",
    "the heating term is shown for @xmath48 of simulation time . at this time",
    ", the perturbation has not reached the upper layers of the domain above @xmath49 .",
    "the heating term values are below @xmath50 , with the location of the largest values at the top of the domain .",
    "the values of @xmath24 reach their maximum in the interior of the flux tube , while the static currents are largest at the flux tube boundaries . as a consequence ,",
    "the heating by dissipation of static currents is strongest at the tube walls .",
    "note that the wall heating is present at all heights , but is largest in the upper part of the domain , as a consequence of the strong increase of @xmath24 with height ( see similar case in * ? ? ?",
    "at @xmath51 the situation changes .",
    "the wave perturbations reach the upper part of the domain , and the maximum of the heating term is localised in the regions around the chromospheric shocks . further on , at @xmath52 ( third column of fig .  [",
    "fig : ambiheating ] ) , the ambipolar diffusion heating rate reaches @xmath53 , which is two orders of magnitude higher than for the case of dissipation of static currents ( first column of the figure ) .",
    "the high heating rate region is now not confined to the chromospheric shock anymore , and occupies the whole upper part of the domain above @xmath54 height .",
    "in order to separate the different modes in the atmosphere where @xmath55 , and study their behavior and relation to heating , we projected the velocities in the computational domain onto the three characteristic directions , defined by the following vectors @xcite : @xmath56 ;   \\label{eq : projections1}\\ ] ] @xmath57 ; \\label{eq : projections2}\\ ] ] @xmath58 .",

    "the first vector @xmath61 is directed along the magnetic field lines .",
    "the second vector @xmath62 gives the direction perpendicular to @xmath63 in the plane containing the field lines and gravity .",
    "the third vector is perpendicular to the first two .",
    "these projections allow to separate the fast wave in the @xmath64 projection and the alfvn wave in the @xmath62 projection .",
    "this was used to analyse the relative influence of slow and alfvn waves on the perpendicular current , and , subsequently , on the ambipolar heating in the simulation .",
    "[ fig : core ] shows the occurrence plots of the perpendicular current @xmath65 versus the magnetic field fluctuations along @xmath62 ( alfvn wave , left panel ) , and along @xmath64 ( fast wave , right panel ) .",
    "clearly , alfvn waves have a stronger effect on the chromospheric non - ideal plasma heating .",
    "furthermore , the perpendicular current increases with the increase of alfvn wave perturbation in the magnetic field , while the occurrence plot shows no significant dependence of the perpendicular current on the fast wave magnetic field perturbation amplitude .",
    "slow waves , aligned with @xmath61 , are also produced by the oscillatory source in our simulations .",
    "however , they do not perturb the magnetic field in the perpendicular to the field line direction , therefore have only a minor effect on the energy balance in the modelled chromosphere .    through the heating term in the energy equation eq .",
    "[ eq : energy - single - p ] associated with @xmath24 , the wave energy is converted into thermal energy . this process is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - in ] . in this plot , the time dependences of the volume - averaged thermal ( black curve ) , kinetic ( blue curve ) and magnetic ( red curve ) energy densities per unit volume are shown .",
    "the averaging of the energy density values is carried over the volume around the tube axis , extending in the simulated chromosphere between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the volume boundaries lie within the plasma @xmath68 surface , which also coincides with the region where @xmath24 is maximal . in the left panel of this figure ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that the thermal energy density in the @xmath43 simulation increases over time due to the dissipation of static currents in the initial non - current - free magnetic field configuration .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetic field energy density decreases over time .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - in ] shows the difference between the corresponding energy densities in the @xmath45 simulation and @xmath44 simulation .",
    "the energy densities from the @xmath43 run ( left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy - in ] ) were also subtracted .",
    "it is evident from the plot that the dissipation of the currents induced by the oscillatory source leads to the decrease of the kinetic and magnetic energy density , as the magnetic energy gain due to the source action is the same in the ambipolar and ideal simulations , while the additional dissipation present in the ambipolar simulation decreases the magnetic field energy and converts it into the thermal energy .",
    "the average thermal energy per unit volume being deposited to the low-@xmath31 chromospheric plasma due to wave dissipation is about 10 - 20 times greater than the one deposited due to the dissipation of static currents .",
    "the computed spatially - averaged thermal energy density difference due to dissipation of the perpendicular currents caused by waves corresponds to the additional temporally - averaged thermal energy flux of @xmath69 through the magnetised chromosphere , assuming uniform heating distribution for simplicity ( similar to @xcite ) . while this estimate is about one order of magnitude less than generally accepted value required to compensate the radiative energy losses ( @xmath70 , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the poynting flux in our simulations at the chromospheric level ( @xmath71 ) is equal to @xmath72 , which is also nearly an order of magnitude less than that value",
    ". therefore , our result suggests that waves , produced by photospheric motions , are an important energy source to provide heating of the solar chromosphere .",
    "further evidence is provided by the measurements of poynting flux absorption .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pf - ratio ] shows horizontally - averaged poynting flux in the simulations with the oscillatory source and with ( black curves ) and without ( red curves ) ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the averaging is carried out over a narrow region within @xmath73 range around the tube axis .",
    "the poynting flux in the @xmath44 simulation decreases with height due to the tube expansion out of the averaging region boundaries , and does not behave differently from the @xmath45 simulation in the lower solar atmosphere . starting from @xmath74 height , the ideal and non - ideal simulation curves diverge .",
    "the decrease in the poynting flux by the factor of up to 0.8 is produced by ambipolar diffusion only .",
    "the poynting flux absorption dependence on height is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pf - ratio ] .",
    "the spatially averaged absorption coefficient is @xmath75 for the tube axis region .",
    "in this paper we investigated chromospheric heating by oscillations in the chromospheric magnetic fields .",
    "an initial study was performed using a single magnetic flux tube , rooted in the photosphere in magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "a monochromatic oscillatory perturbation was placed off the tube axis in the deep photosphere to generate magneto - acoustic oscillations in the magnetic flux tube . the currents , corresponding to fast magneto - acoustic and alfvn waves , have been shown to be dissipated by the ambipolar diffusion mechanism in the simulated chromosphere .",
    "it has been shown that for a source amplitude of @xmath76 , which mimicks photospheric motions , the heating due to the perturbation is two orders of magnitude larger than that due to the static currents dissipation .",
    "the perturbation we used generates all types of mhd waves in the magnetic flux tube .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the alfvnic perturbation component has a stronger effect on the heating .",
    "generally , it is expected that oscillations with higher ( @xmath77 ) frequencies are more efficiently dissipated into heat compared to lower ( similar to the ones used in this paper ) frequency oscillations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , a power law is expected for the velocity power spectrum in the solar photosphere , including its high - frequency part , currently not observed @xcite , leading to less power at higher frequencies .",
    "consequently , it is currently difficult to draw a unique conclusion on a sole mechanism for the chromospheric heating based on a single simulation .",
    "nevertheless , this study should be understood as an initial proof of concept of the chromospheric energy balance based on mhd wave absorption in non - uniform three - dimensional magnetised chromospheric plasmas , with a more detailed study of the absorption on the source frequency , amplitude and simulation resolution to follow .",
    "furthermore , as the simulation has to resolve the smallest spatial and temporal scales in the system , which in the case of frequencies of the order of @xmath78 is defined by the oscillation wavelength and period , an extremely high spatial resolution of the order of few hundred meters would be necessary to directly test high - frequency currents dissipation .",
    "therefore , even with currently available computational resources some extrapolation would be required .",
