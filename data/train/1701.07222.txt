    "however , in practice many of these applications are challenged by optical losses occuring in the metallic components @xcite .",
    "so far , no viable alternatives to the noble metals have been found and the detrimental losses have appeared to be an unavoidable property of any conducting material .    optical losses in metals originate from electronic transitions between the occupied and unoccupied parts of the crystal band structure , see figure 1 . in the absence of any scattering mechanisms , absorption of photons",

    "however , scattering on crystal imperfections , phonons or other electrons , can provide the extra momentum required for light absorption via non - vertical electronic transitions , cf . transitions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "typically , losses increase significantly above the onset of interband transitions which sets a hard upper limit on the operating frequencies of a plasmonic material .",
    "the effect of intraband scattering ( transition ( ii ) ) on the optical properties of metals is often accounted for by a phenomenological relaxation time . as we show here , a key to describe and discover intrinsic low - loss metals",
    "is to move beyond the commonly used constant relaxation time approximation and include band structure effects in the scattering rate .",
    "previous searches for new plasmonic materials in the optical regime have explored the alkali - noble intermetallics@xcite and transition metal nitrides@xcite .",
    "some materials showed promise although their performance was still lower than that of the noble metals .",
    "because all optical losses ultimately depend on the existence of an initial occupied and final unoccupied electronic state , one strategy for reducing losses has been to reduce the number of states available for scattering . following this principle , doped semiconductors and transparent conducting oxides",
    "have been proposed for applications in the mid and near - infrared , respectively@xcite .",
    "recently , graphene plasmonics has been extensively studied due to its low density of states around the dirac cone and easily tuneable plasma frequency@xcite .",
    "the elusive loss - less metal@xcite represents the ideal plasmonic material where no states are available for scattering in a particular frequency range thus eliminating optical losses completely , cf .",

    "such a metal is obtained when the metallic , i.e. partially filled , band(s ) are separated from all higher and lower lying bands by sufficiently large energy gaps .",
    "metals with such isolated intermediate bands are very rare among the conventional bulk materials . on the other hand , low - dimensional materials , in particular layered materials , with a significant fraction of under - coordinated atoms and thus overall weaker hybridization ,",
    "might be more likely to exhibit such characteristic band structures .",
    "in this paper we test this hypothesis by examining the computed band structures of the metallic layered materials identified in ref .",
    "we discover that the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) tas@xmath0 and nbs@xmath0 as well as aluminum(ii ) chloride , alcl@xmath0 , have monolayer band structures that resemble that of the elusive loss - less metal , and confirm by first - principles calculations that the special electronic structure does entail lowered optical losses .",
    "the constant relaxation time approximation is shown to be insufficient for describing the optical permittivity of these materials and we propose a simple model of the scattering rate based on the joint density of states to remedy this deficiency . based on the promising results obtained for the tmds we propose a new class of bandstructure engineered layered materials composed of transition metal chalcogenide - halide layers that greatly suppress the optical losses , and demonstrate the improved performance of these materials for thin film waveguiding and transformation optics .    ) for silver ( green ) and alcl@xmath0 ( blue ) with a vacancy defect .",

    "figure [ bandstructure ] shows the atomic structures , band structures , and density of states ( dos ) for ( a ) 2h - tas@xmath0 , ( b ) 3r - nbs@xmath0 , and ( c ) 1t - alcl@xmath0 .",

    "the monolayer breaks the degeneracy of the highest valence band at the @xmath3 point and closes the gap to the metallic band , but the dos above and below the intermediate band remains fairly low .",
    "inter - layer hybridization plays a smaller role for 1t - alcl@xmath0 ; in particular , the band gaps are present for both the monolayer and bulk .",
    "the metallic band in alcl@xmath0 is formed by the al @xmath4-states , and the small band width of 1 ev is a consequence of the weak hybridization between the al atoms within the same atomic plane with the cl atoms acting mainly as spacers .",
    "we stress that alcl@xmath0 is thermodynamically unstable .",
    "although its calculated heat of formation is negative ( -0.89 ev / atom ) relative to the standard states of al and cl , it lies 0.7 ev above the convex hull when considering other competing phases ( see methods ) .",
    "in contrast , the layered compound alcl@xmath2 is stable and has been experimentally synthesised .",
    "starting from alcl@xmath2 it may be feasible to remove the loosely bound cl interstitial layer and thereby form metastable alcl@xmath0 .",
    "we verify that the gapped metallic band structures entail lowered optical losses by performing first - principles calculations to obtain the dielectric function of alcl@xmath0 with an al vacancy introduced in a 3x3x2 supercell .",
    "the introduction of a vacancy is necessary to probe the optical losses due to intraband transitions where the defect provides the required momentum , see figure 1 , transition ii .",
    "( qualitatively similar results would be expected from phonon or electron scattering , however , such processes are more complicated to describe from first principles . ) for comparison , a similar calculation was performed for a 3x3x3 supercell of ag with a single vacancy ( see methods ) .",
    "figure [ figdef ] ( full lines ) shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function which is directly related to the optical losses of the metal . optical losses at low frequencies due to the intraband transitions are indeed observed .",
    "the dielectric function of a metal can be divided into contributions from interband and intraband transitions , respectively .",
    "it is customary to approximate the latter by a drude response : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the plasma frequency and @xmath7 is the constant relaxation rate of the free carriers . in figure [ figdef ]",
    "we show the result of the drude model ( thick grey lines ) with @xmath7 fitted to obtain the best correspondence with the first - principles results using the bulk plasma frequency for @xmath6 .",
    "excellent agreement is found for silver all the way up to the onset of inter - band transitions demonstrating the validity of the constant relaxation time approximation for this material .",
    "in contrast , it is not possible to fit the dielectric function of alcl@xmath0 by the simple drude model below the onset of interband transitions at 1.5 ev .",
    "this is a result of the special band structure of alcl@xmath0 which introduces a strong energy dependence of the joint density of states ( jdos ) .",
    "the jdos gives the density of electron - hole pairs at a given frequency ( disregarding momentum conservation ) and thus represents the density of final states entering the expression for the scattering rate .",
    "in particular , the drude model is not able to capture the strong reduction of the losses in the range 1 - 1.5 ev . in this energy range",
    "there are essentially no states available for scattering because of ( i ) the finite band width of the partially filled metallic band and ( ii ) the presence of band gaps separating the metallic band from the rest of the bands .",
    "consequently , the jdos will vanish at energies above the intraband transitions and below the onset of inter band transitions . in the case of alcl@xmath0 ,",
    "the band gaps are not large enough to completely separate the interband transitions from the intraband transitions , and consequently neither the jdos nor @xmath8 become exactly zero",
    ". however , the jdos is strongly suppressed in the range 1 - 1.5 ev and this is the origin of the low - loss nature of alcl@xmath0 .    * relaxation rate model .",
    "* a more realistic description of the relaxation rate should include information about the number of available electron - hole transitions , i.e. the jdos . a simple way to incorporate such a dependence is via @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant controlling the scattering strength .",
    "the expression can be motivated in different ways , but here it suffices to observe that ( i ) it reduces to the constant relaxation time approximation for a metal with a constant dos in a region around fermi energy ( in which case the jdos @xmath11 ) and ( ii ) it correctly leads to a vanishing relaxation rate for energies where there are no final states for the scattering .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ figdef ] ( dashed lines ) the model provides an excellent description of the optical losses of both materials . in the rest of the paper we use eq .",
    "( [ eq.model ] ) to include scattering effects in a generic way setting the constant @xmath10 to the same value for all materials .",
    "this value is chosen to reproduce the experimental line width of the ag surface plasmon ( see figure [ plasdf]c ) .",
    "we note that the jdos model only accounts for first - order ( quasi-)elastic scattering processes .",
    "higher - order processes involving generation of several phonons or electron - hole pairs in one coherent photon - mediated event , could lead to absorption ( loss ) at energies between the intraband and interband transitions where the jdos model would otherwise predict @xmath8 to vanish .",
    "we expect losses due to higher - order processes to be small in the near - ir and therefore neglect them in the following .",

    "the single interface plasmonic waveguide silver shows significantly longer propagation lengths and lifetimes than any of the vdw metals .",
    "this is caused by the more efficient dielectric screening of ag compared to the vdw metals , which implies that only a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic energy is contained within the silver surface , see sup . mat .",
    "the downside of the strong screening is the accompanying large mode widths caused by the electric field being pushed into the dielectric .    as the thickness of the thin - film plasmonic waveguide",

    "the dependence of the plasmon lifetime on the intrinsic optical losses and the electric field distribution inside the metal is    @xmath19    from this it is clear that the relatively better performance of the layered metals in thin film waveguides as compared to ag must be due to lower intrinsic losses because the electric field fraction within the vdw metal is much larger than in silver ( sup . mat .",

    "it is well known that the pbe exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional underestimates both band gaps of semiconductors and interband transition energies in metals@xcite . to test the influence of the xc - functional we have computed the dielectric function of 2h - tas@xmath0 using the range separated hybrid functional ( hse06 ) which generally yield more reliable band energies@xcite .",
    "the primary effect of the hse is to increase the size of the two gaps around the intermediate metallic band by around 0.5 ev ( see fig .",

    "the lower electronegativity of the group 3 compared to group 4 transition metals and the higher electronegativity of the halides compared to chalcogens , should increase the gap between the bands below and above the intermediate metallic band , which are composed mainly of chalcogen @xmath20 and metal @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "this should blue shift the interband transitions and decrease optical losses .",
    "the calculated formation energies of the mxy compounds range from -2.53 ev to -0.92 ev per atom relative to the standard states . to check thermodynamic stability against other competing phases we compare the formation energies to the convex hull , see figure s5 .",
    "out of the 27 compounds , 19 are found to be stable while the rest are only weakly unstable with formation energies lying less than 50 mev above the convex hull .",
    "the structural stability of the chalo - halides was checked by performing relaxations of the monolayers in supercells containing @xmath22 primitive cells ( containing 12 atoms ) . with initial random distortions , the atoms relaxed back to restore the symmetry of the hexagonal lattice indicating that the structures are at least locally stable .",
    "the dft calculations were performed fully spin polarised , but all the materials converged to a non - magnetic ground state .",

    "reassuringly the best tmd turns out to be 2h - tas@xmath0 which is one of the metals with an intermediate metallic band . in general , the losses in the tmds increase from sulphides to selenides to tellurides due to a lowering of the onset of interband transition .",
    "a similar trend is known for the semi - conducting tmds where the band gaps decrease when progressing through the chalcogenide group towards higher atomic number@xcite .",
    "all the mxy compounds outperform both 2h - tas@xmath0 and the noble metals in the technologically important near - infrared frequency range .",
    "the improved performance is attributed to the larger gaps surrounding the intermediate metallic band which increases the plasma frequency and extends the loss - less regime between the intraband and interband transitions , see figure [ figfom](b ) .",

    "a critical issue for the layered metals considered in this work is stability .",
    "even though most of the chalco - halides were found to be thermodynamically stable relative to other competing phases involving the same elements , the materials could oxidize and disintegrate when exposed to air or moisture .",
    "whether this will happen is largely a matter of kinetics and a theoretical assessment requires calculation of reaction barriers which is beyond the present study .",
    "however , we note that encapsulation could be a way to protect the materials from reacting with other species . for example",
    ", it was recently demonstrated that encapsulation in hexagonal boron - nitride can protect and stabilize phosphorene in air , which in its free form is highly unstable and oxidizes quickly ( @xcite ) .",
    "airtight encapsulation of sensitive materials are routinely used in other fields such as organic light emitting diodes where the organic layer is sealed between glass plates .",
    "a potential problem that pervades all narrow band metals is the risk of a phase - transition to magnetic- , charge density wave- , or mott - insulating ground states .",
    "such phase - transitions are often driven by a high density of states at the fermi level .",
    "thus the ideal metallic band for plasmonics should be wide enough to avoid such phase transitions and narrow enough to separate the intraband transitions from the interband transitions .",
    "our calculations indicate that the chalco - halides are stable towards local structural distortions , but do not rule out the possibility of charge density wave - like distortions with larger periodicity .",
    "in fact , some of the metallic tmds are known to exhibit charge density waves at low temperatures . on the other hand , at room temperature the presence of these phases",
    "is not expected to influence the optical properties that are governed by the gross features of the electronic structure .",
    "moreover , the band width of the chalco - halides are comparable to those of the tmds ( see figure [ figfom](b ) ) which are known to behave as normal metals at room temperature , even for few layer samples@xcite .",
    "finally , we point to an added benefit of the vdw metals proposed in this work .",
    "namely , their 2d nature allow them to be stacked with other non - metallic 2d materials like mos@xmath0 or hexagonal boron - nitride , to produce van der waals metamaterials with ultra thin layer thickness and atomically well defined interfaces .",
