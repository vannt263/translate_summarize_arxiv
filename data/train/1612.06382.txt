    "non - symmorphic space groups force band degeneracies at high symmetry points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , which makes materials in these space groups ideal candidates for dirac semimetals ( dsms ) in two or three dimensions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to `` conventional '' dirac materials ( e.  g.  graphene ) , such specially protected band crossings can not be lifted by spin orbit coupling ( soc ) allowing for two dimensional ( 2d ) dsms without a gap @xcite . besides fourfold degeneracies , which result in normal dirac cones , non",
    "- symmorphic space groups can also force three- , six- , or eight fold degeneracies which has recently lead to the prediction of new quasiparticles , beyond dirac , weyl or majorana , in non - symmorphic materials @xcite .",
    "+ the problem in realizing such non - symmorphic dsms is their requirement of an odd band filling to locate the fermi level at the degenerate point .",
    "more specifically , to have a `` clean '' non - symmorphic dsm , an isolated half - filled band is required @xcite .",
    "this can be understood if one considers that the translational part of the non - symmorphic symmetry causes a folding of the bz , which results in the forced band degeneracies .",
    "hence , these degeneracies are located at half filling of the band . however , non - symmorphic degeneracies can be at the fermi level also in charge balanced systems , if they are stabilized by other pockets .",
    "it should be noted that here we are counting electrons per formula unit rather than per unit cell , as commonly done for non - symmorphic systems ( see si for further explanation ) @xcite .",
    "half - filled bands are very difficult to obtain in real materials , since compounds with such band fillings are commonly unstable , and typically undergo peierls transitions @xcite or become mott insulators @xcite .",
    "for example , compounds with @xmath0 filling , such as tas@xmath1 or tase@xmath1 , are well - known for forming charge density waves and undergoing peierls transitions @xcite .",
    "compounds with other partial @xmath2-fillings typically undergo mott transitions and/or localize antiferromagnetically to become insulating .",
    "typical examples are transition metal oxides such as mno , coo , nio @xcite , or the cuprates @xcite .",
    "isolated , half - filled _ s _ or _ p _ bands are even more difficult to stabilize",
    ". a famous example is babio@xmath3 with a formally half - filled _",
    "6s _ band .",
    "however in reality , in babio@xmath3 the unit cell is doubled with two distinct bismuth sites where the _ 6s _ band on one site is filled and on the other site it is empty @xcite .",
    "electron - doped babio@xmath3 has also recently been proposed to be a topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the same type of charge order also appears in many other compounds with formally half - filled _ s _ bands , examples being cstlcl@xmath3 @xcite , pb@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite or sn@xmath1s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another common way to avoid half - filling for @xmath5-block materials is to form polyanionic zintl compounds @xcite . here , metal - metal bonds cause localization of the electrons and thus semiconducting behavior . other materials that formally have half - filled bands and do not localize or distort are typically stabilized by another band that overlaps with the half - filled band .",
    "examples are the alkali metals or coppermonochalcogenides ( e.g. cus ) @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , there is currently no example of a real material that has a non - symmorphic dirac crossing located at the fermi level . in order to study the effect of band degeneracies forced by non - symmorphic symmetry on the transport behavior , it is crucial to find a material where such a band crossing is located at the fermi level . here",
    "we present an alternative route to achieve a material with a non - symmorphic band crossing at the fermi level , opening the possibility to study the transport behavior of these exotic dirac fermions .",
    "+ zrsis , a material that recently received attention for its dirac line node at the fermi level @xcite , was the first material that had been experimentally shown to exhibit a dirac cone protected by non - symmorphic symmetry @xcite .",
    "this fourfold degenerate point is located about 0.5ev below the fermi level .",
    "zrsis is a charge balanced system , so that a non - symmorphic crossing is expected to be above and/or below the fermi level .",
    "therefore , it is a good starting point to realize such a crossing at the fermi level .",
    "doping could be one way to achieve this , but doping not only introduces many defects and disorder , making transport experiments more obscure ; it also can be chemically challenging . a more promising way to alter the electronic structure",
    "is anisotropic strain that changes the hopping integrals between orbitals and , therefore , can shift features of the electronic structure to different energies .",
    "note , that due to zrsis s electronic structure , both ways would yield a material where the non - symmorphic degeneracy is stabilized by additional pockets at the fermi level , hence avoiding an unstable , isolated , half - filled band @xcite .",
    "+ zrsis could be a promising material for realizing 2d dirac fermions protected by non - symmoprhic symmetry , since it shows resemblance to the prediction of such fermions in a hypothetical 2d square net of atoms @xcite .",
    "it has been shown with transport studies , however , that zrsis has a rather 3d fermi surface @xcite .",
    "in contrast , analysis of de haas - van alphen oscillations revealed that the fermi surface of the isostructural and isoelectronic compound zrsite exhibits more 2d character @xcite . + here",
    ", we show with angular resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations that zrsite exhibits a dirac crossing protected by non - symmorphic symmetry very close to the fermi level that is stabilized by other pockets located at other parts in the bz , allowing the non - symmorphic degeneracy to be at the fermi level in a closed - shell system .",
    "since zrsite is isoelectronic to zrsis , this is an example of a charge balanced system with a forced degeneracy at the fermi level that is stabilized by other pockets .",
    "this is a result of the much larger @xmath6-ratio in zrsite as compared to zrsis @xcite .",
    "substituting te for s in zrsis is , therefore , equivalent to applying uniaxial tensile strain that shifts the fermi level , but does not pin it there like a half - filled band would .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy at the x point remains due to symmetry retention in zrsite , forming a non - dispersive dirac line node very close to the fermi level along the xr line .",
    "further , the interlayer forces of zrsite are very weak , indicating the possibility to create a 2d material with a non - symmorphic dirac line node at the fermi level .",
    "we report on the first real material that can be studied with transport measurements to investigate dirac fermions that originate from non - symmorphic symmetry .",
    "* sample synthesis and crystal structure characterization * + single crystals of zrsite were synthesized from the constituent elements by mixing stoichiometric amounts of zr , si and te and a small amount of iodine ( 2  wt% ) . the mixtures were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube , heated to 1100@xmath7c ( with a 100@xmath7c gradient ) at a rate of 2@xmath7c / min and kept at this temperature for three days . since zrsite is a high temperature phase , a cooling rate of at least 5@xmath7c / min was applied .",

    "it shows similarities to zrsis , as expected from a compound that is isostructral and isoelectronic . as in zrsis , the electronic structure features fourfold degeneracies as a result of non - symmorphic symmetry at x , r , a and m , as well as additional dirac crossings along the @xmath14x and @xmath14 m line .",
    "the fourfold degeneracies remain along the xr and ma line ( red highlight in fig .",

    "fig : zrsite_bands_calc]a ) .",
    "there are , however , also some striking differences in the electronic structures of the two compounds .",
    "the highly dispersed dirac crossings along @xmath14x and @xmath14 m that form a line node around the fermi level in zrsis , are more gapped in zrsite , which we attribute to the much larger soc of te compared to s. the effect of soc is highlighted in fig .",

    "soc also lifts the degeneracy along the xm and ra line to a larger extent in zrsite than in zrsis .",
    "further differences in the electronic structures are unrelated to the magnitude of soc .",
    "in contrast to zrsis , where the fourfold degeneracies resulting from non - symmophic symmetry at x are located roughly 0.5ev above and below the fermi level , they are much closer in energy in zrsite ( about 400mev apart ) . as a result ,",
    "one of the cones appears at the fermi level . in almost all other _ mxz_-phases ( _ m _ = zr , hf , _ x _ = si , ge , sn and _ z _ = s , se , te ) , the degeneracies at x are further away from the fermi level @xcite .",
    "zrsite differs from most other _",
    "mxz_-phases in the way that it has a much larger @xmath6-ratio @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : zrsite_bands_calc]d shows how the @xmath6-ratio of the different _ mxz_-phases relates to the energy position of the non - symmorphic dirac cones ( i.e. the fourfold degenerate points ) .",
    "the data has been extracted from the bulk band structures of other known _ mxz _ phases , calculated using the published lattice parameters @xcite ( see supplemental information fig .  3 and 4 for plots of all bulk band structures ) .",
    "note that the energy of the cones slightly deviates from measured values due to @xmath15 dependence .",
    "while in most phases the @xmath6-ratio has values between 2.2 and 2.3 with the two cones located around 0.6ev above and below the fermi level , the situation is very different for zrsite and hfsite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zrsite_bands_calc]e ) . both compounds have much larger @xmath6-ratios which causes the energy difference between the cones to decrease . in the case of hfsite",
    "both cones are located below the fermi level .",
    "zrsite , however , has exactly the right @xmath6-ratio to move one cone to the fermi level .",
    "the reason for the much higher @xmath6-ratio can be traced to the different sizes of the si and te atoms .",
    "while the _ a_-axis is related to the si - si distance in the si square net and hence similar to the one of zrsis , the te atoms need more space , which is why the _ c_-axis elongates .",
    "the resulting uni - axial strain seems to have a strong effect on the electronic structure moving the degeneracies at x towards each other , which results in one crossing being very close to the fermi level .",
    "additionally , it is noteworthy to investigate the dispersion of the bulk band structure perpendicular to the cleaving plane ( the @xmath15-direction ) . in comparison to zrsis",
    ", zrsite appears much more two dimensional .",
    "this observation is not only in line with previous de haas - van alphen measurements @xcite , but can also be related to the enlarged @xmath6-ratio of zrsite . since the te - te distance in zrsite is much larger than the s - s distance in zrsis , the forces connecting the layers are much weaker .",
    "in addition , the electronegativity of te is lower than the one of s , reducing the ionic bonding character between the layers .",
    "this effect can also easily be seen experimentally , since zrsite can be cleaved with adhesive tape while more force is needed to cleave zrsis .",
    "this enhanced two - dimensionality leads to a very flat dispersion along the xr line in the electronic structure .",
    "the r point is located above the x point in the bz and the four - fold degeneracy is maintained along the line between the two points .",
    "hence , zrsite features a very flat and non - dispersive , four - fold degenerate line node along xr , which is almost directly located at the fermi level .     [ fig : zrsite_bands_calc ]    * arpes measurements *    in order to demonstrate the connection between the @xmath6-ratio and the location of the non - symmophic dirac cones , we performed arpes measurements on zrsite .",

    ", we observe an ellipsoid rather than a point which indicates that the samples are slightly hole doped and the fermi level is slightly below the non - symmorphic cone .",
    "similarly , crystals of zrsis have also been shown to be hole doped @xcite . at an initial energy of about @xmath21mev",
    "the lower non - symmorphic crossing at the x point can be seen as a point ( fig .",

    "the energy dispersion along the @xmath14x@xmath14 direction is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zrsite_bands]a .",
    "when compared with the bulk band structure shown above , additional states appear in the arpes data . to test the effect of the surface , we performed calculations of a five unit cell thick slab .",
    "the calculations are displayed next to the measured data . both , the calculation and arpes data , show a rhombus - like feature of linear dispersion that is symmetric around the x point at @xmath22@xmath23 . the upper and",
    "the lower corner each represent one of the non - symmophic dirac cones , while the left and right corner represent the band crossings along the @xmath14x line that are gapped by soc .",
    "dashed lines indicate the rhombus - shaped feature in the measured data .",
    "we find the fermi velocities of these bands to be @xmath24ev   and @xmath25ev , which is comparable to zrsis @xcite .",
    "note , that in the slab calculation , the gap created by soc in the rhombus - like feature appears very small due to the dispersion along @xmath15 .",
    "it is , therefore , not possible to resolve this gap in arpes . in the measurement ,",
    "the top cone is slightly above the fermi level ( about @xmath26mev ) , while the lower cone is at around @xmath21mev .",
    "the observed slight shift in energy of the calculated and measured band structure likely originates from a slightly hole doped sample .",
    "the data prove the presence of a dirac crossing protected by non - symmorphic symmetry very close to the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , the arpes data show additional bands that can not be identified as bulk states , but rather as surface states .",
    "similar surface derived states have also been observed in other _ mxz _",
    "phases @xcite . by overlaying @xmath14xm and zra",

    "( see also fig .  6 in the supplemental information for a surface projection of the calculated band structure .",
    "the states originating from the surface te and zr atoms mostly contribute to the bands appearing with high intensity in the arpes measurements . ) as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : zrsite_bands]a , an intense surface band crosses the lower part of the rhombus .",
    "overall , the agreement between the calculated band structure of a slab and the measured data is very good .",
    "it is easier to identify surface derived states along the xm direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zrsite_bands]b ) , because along this direction there is a gap in the bulk band structure and hence , no bulk bands interfere with the surface derived bands .",
    "the upper band that is visible in the arpes data does not exist in the bulk band structure calculations and is , therefore , surface induced .",
    "the surface bands appear to cut the rhombus and then recombine 1ev above the fermi level .",
    "this hybridization between surface derived and bulk bands has been observed and discussed in zrsis as well and seems to be a typical phenomenon in these types of materials @xcite .",
    "further , if soc is not included , the bulk bands along the xm line are degenerate , but if soc is included in the calculation the degeneracy is also lifted , showing that the line along xm is not fully protected by the non - symmorphic symmetry , which is in agreement with the theoretical prediction for square net 2d non - symmorpic materials @xcite .",
    "in contrast to in zrsis where this lifting could not be resolved in arpes it is clearly visible here , due to the higher soc on te .",
    "a similar effect has been reported for hfsis , where this effect is even more pronounced @xcite .",
    "the arpes data are generally in very good agreement with the calculated band structure and clearly show that the non - symmorphic dirac cone is extremely close to the fermi level .",
    "the samples are slightly hole doped , which seems to be common in _ mxz _ type phases .",
    "since the compound hfsite has a non - symmorphic dirac cone slightly below the fermi level in the prediction , it might be located closer to the fermi level in an experiment due to doping . therefore , both phases , hfsite and zrsite are very promising candidates for investigating the transport behavior originating from bands that are affected by degeneracies forced by non - symmorphic symmetry .",
    "since zrsite can be easily cleaved with adhesive tape and it has already been shown that very thin layers of this compound can be created @xcite , it is also a promising material to create 2d devices of a non - symmorphic dirac semimetal . to emphasize this , dft calculations of a monolayer of zrsite",
    "were performed showing that the electronic structure of the monolayer is very similar to the bulk compound ( see supplemental information fig .",
    "[ fig : zrsite_bands ]",
    "in summary , we showed that zrsite features a dirac crossing protected by non - symmorphic symmetry that is located very close to the fermi level .",
    "the fourfold degeneracy at x remains along the xr - line due to the two - dimensionality of the crystal structure .",
    "zrsite is therefore the first material where dirac fermions that are a result of non - symmorphic symmetry can be studied with transport experiments . since it is difficult to synthesize materials that have half - filled bands , materials with non - symmorphic degeneracies at the fermi level are extremely rare .",
    "we showed that the energy location of the non - symmorphic dirac cones depends on the @xmath6-ratio of the unit cell and is , therefore , affected by uni - axial strain .",
    "externally applied or intrinsic chemical strain could be used to tune the energy of non - symmorphic degeneracies in other materials as well .",
    "for example , strain could be a way to create materials with three- , six- , or eightfold degeneracies at the fermi level , allowing for transport investigations of new predicted quasiparticles .",
