    "gravitation is a generic example of a selfgravitating interaction which is not able to effectively confine particles : it is always possible that some of them reach the sufficient energy for escaping from a putative system , so that the astrophysical systems undergo an evaporation process , and therefore , they will never be in a _ real _ thermodynamic equilibrium .",

    "the interest in such study is justified as follows .    as discussed elsewhere ,",

    ", we will perform in section [ nonhomogeneous ] a theoretical analysis of the effect of evaporation on the distribution function over the single particle six - dimensional @xmath1-phase space , @xmath2 .",
    "this analysis is carried out in the context of hamiltonian systems driven by a very strong chaotic dynamics , and our interest is the consideration of the nonhomogeneous character of the confining interaction .",

    "consequently , a given particle that gains sufficient velocity after a collision will evaporate , since the probability that this particle loses the excessive energy before escaping from container is very small .",
    "the third idealization is to suppose that the system is embedded in a bidimensional space .",
    "the following _ toy dynamics _ will be taken into account in order to perform a numerical study of the above model .",

    "since the stability of these tendencies can not be simultaneously satisfied , the system evolves towards certain intermediate distribution which is never stationary .",
    "it is well - known the difficulties to find an appropriate criterion leading to the theoretical prediction of quasi - stationary profiles .",
    "we only found an appropriate criterion when the system equilibration mechanism is effective in exploring all accessible configurations which are stable under the evaporation : the system practically reach the most probable one , being this configuration the quasi - stationary profile . in those cases",
    ", the contribution of the dissipative terms in the entropy dynamical evolution seems to be only comparable to the term @xmath168   $ ] for configurations close to the most likely because of the predominance of binary transitions which does not involve particle evaporation .",
    "however , the picture turns out to be considerably difficult in the general case with the reduction of the effectiveness of the equilibration mechanisms .",
    "as already stressed , during the dynamical evolution the system distribution functions will converge towards certain sequence which is identified with the quasi - stationary one .",
    "once settled at a given point of this sequence , the system will evolve along it .",
    "if we know some configuration belonging to this sequence , the progressive evolution of the system will reproduce the rest of the quasi - stationary profiles .",
    "it is not difficult to understand that this quasi - stationary sequence _ must contain _ the microscopic configuration with the maximum energy per particle @xmath30 , @xmath186 . since @xmath187 , the distribution function with maxima energy per particle is @xmath188",
    "thus , in our opinion , the problem of finding the quasi - stationary profiles can be reduced to the determination of the temporal dependence of the distribution function @xmath189 by using the dynamical equation ( [ gte ] ) with @xmath190 , but this problem does not have a general analytical solution because of the nonlinear nature of the dynamics .",

    "@xmath30 , which is shown in fig.[entropy ] by considering @xmath127 .",
    "we obtain the data from two dynamical experiments , as well as by the extrapolation to the low energies region .",
    "the first experiment was performed by considering @xmath192 in order to reduce the rhythm of the dynamical evolution when @xmath30 is close to @xmath0 , and the second one , by considering @xmath193 .",
    "the reader can recall that this parameter controls the temporal increase for each computational step , but it does not affect the dependence of distribution function on the energy per particle .",
    "both experiments were performed by considering @xmath194 and by dividing the range @xmath130 in @xmath195 intervals in order to build the distribution functions .",
    "the function @xmath186 was approximated by using a * dsic * with @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the second experiment starts from a * tbic * with @xmath198 , which  exhibits a fast convergence towards the quasi - stationary sequence of the first experiment .",
    "notice that in this figure there is a superposition of both experiments in the intermediate energetic range and no discrepancy is evidenced .",
    "the range @xmath199 was obtained from the extrapolation of the experimental data because of the evolution is extremely slow in this interval , and basically , the distribution functions do not differ significantly from the truncating boltzmann profile , yielding @xmath200 in this energetic range .",
    "the model system considered in the above sections disregards the effect of the nonhomogeneous character of the confining potential energy .",
    "we are interested in describing this effect , at least , in the extreme case where the system equilibration mechanism is very effective . as already observed in the numerical experiments , when the particles are able to explore in an effective fashion all those microscopic configurations which are stable under the evaporation , the progressive evolution of the system leads to the setting of the ordinary equilibrium conditions , as an example , the imposition of the detailed balance in the framework of the binary encounters .    in the context of hamiltonian systems ,",
    "the equilibration mechanisms relay on the strong chaoticity of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "this property usually leads to the ergodicity and the equilibrium conditions are ordinarily described by considering a microcanonical distribution @xcite .",
    "if evaporation is present , the above picture can be naturally generalized by considering a microcanonical distribution where it has been disregarded all those microscopic configurations where the particles are able to escape .",
    "the above argument was used in a very recent paper @xcite in the context of astrophysical systems in order to develop an alternative version of the isothermal model of antonov @xcite .    the stable configurations for a hamiltonian model of the form : @xmath201 is the subset of the n - body phase space where the particles satisfy the inequalities : @xmath202 , being @xmath203 the energy cutoff , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , the linear momentum and potential energy for the _ k - th _ particle : @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "we are interested in the specific form of the quasi - stationary distribution function @xmath208 in such conditions .",
    "this question was solved in ref.@xcite in the context of astrophysical systems by considering the mean field approximation appearing when @xmath4 tends to infinity .",

    "this expression differs from the truncating isothermal profile only because of the presence of the self - consistent function @xmath217 , which appears as an additional consequence of the particle evaporation due to the nonhomogeneous character of the global interaction .",
    "although the @xmath109 _ versus _ @xmath224 dependence ( [ ro ] ) unifies the isothermal with the polytropic dependencies : @xmath225 when @xmath226 is large enough , while @xmath227 when @xmath228 , the presence of the function @xmath229 introduces a sensitive modification to the features of the solutions .",

    "profiles b and d correspond respectively to an isothermal and polytropic configurations with polytropic index @xmath232  @xcite ( characterized by the dependence @xmath233 ) .",
    "the presence of the function @xmath234 leads to a significant concentration of the particles toward the inner regions which goes beyond what the isothermal or the polytropic models predict .",
    "[ t ]    com_prof.eps    it is easy to understand that the function @xmath229 depends in a self - consistent way on the energy function @xmath235 .",
    "therefore , the distribution function @xmath208 , as a whole , depends only on the function @xmath236 , that is , @xmath237   $ ] .",
    "needless to say that this is a requirement of the well - known jeans theorem  @xcite .",
    "however , the consideration of such effect only starting from this last theorem is very unlikely .",
    "the present analysis suggests that the simple generalization of the homogeneous distribution functions @xmath238 , by substituting @xmath239 may be extremely naive , and probably , most of these simple extensions are disregarding important effects of the nonhomogeneous character of the global interaction in presence of particle evaporation .",
    "thus , the consideration of a weaker chaoticity  of the microscopic dynamics and the nonhomogeneous character of the interactions involve serious difficulties in the theoretical prediction of the quasi - stationary profiles .",
    "the reader may notice that the approach developed in ref.@xcite and the standard treatment of some astrophysical structures , such as globular clusters and elliptical galaxies , by using the michie - king profile @xcite , are extreme alternatives to consider the effect of the evaporation in such a framework .",
    "the applicability of such models depends crucially on how effective is the equilibration mechanism in an actual astrophysical systems .",
    "it is well - established that the picture of the binary encounters provide a nice justification for the use of the king s models .",
    "the basic explanation is found in the fact that the long - range character of the gravitational interaction favors much more the small energy interchange among those distant particles in comparison to the large energy interchanges occurring during the close encounters @xcite .    nevertheless , the binary encounter is not the only equilibration mechanism appearing in this context .",
    "in fact , it has been also shown the existence of a very strong chaoticity in gravitational n - body systems @xcite , which acts in time scales much smaller than the characteristic time for the close binary collisions , as well as it operates for every bound energy . in the viewpoint of the author of such work , this result not only confirms that \" ... _ bound collisionless selfgravitating systems are characterized by a dynamical instability proceeding at a very fast rate , but also suggests that they possess the strongest statistical properties , in analogy with those of standard dynamical systems in the regime of fully developed stochasticity ... \" _ @xcite .",
    "as expected , this argument supports the consideration of the ergodic hypothesis in this context , and therefore , the consideration of a suitably regularized microcanonical description for actual astrophysical systems @xcite .    despite the differences concerning to the specific form of the above energy profiles",
    ", the question is that the features of their corresponding spatial particle distributions possess more similarities than differences : both distributions lead to finite configurations with isothermal cores and polytropic haloes , even purely polytropic configurations are  also possible , where the system size is determined from the tidals interactions .    in the remarkable paper @xcite ,",
    "king performed a numerical comparison of the michie - king model with the isothermal distribution truncated at the escape energy , without the consideration of self - consistent function @xmath229 , which is shown in fig.2 and fig.7 of this reference .",
    "while the king model provides an excellent fit for the data corresponding to a high concentrate globular cluster , the truncated distribution is unable to fit an observational data where a larger concentration of particles appears towards the inner region . in our view , this could be the very effect introduced by taking into consideration the self - consistent function @xmath229 , but this last observation deserves a further analysis .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to distinguish the origin of such effect since there exist other physical backgrounds modifying the form of the particles distribution in the space , such as the mass segregation @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent development ) .",
    "the numerical experiments carried out for the gas of binary encounters clearly show the robustness of the quasi - stationary character of the dynamical evolution of this model system .",
    "the specific form of the quasi - stationary distribution functions will depend crucially on the effectiveness of the microscopic dynamics in exploring all those microscopic configurations which are stable under the particle evaporation .",
    "an efficient microscopic dynamics leads to the imposition of the detailed balance for all those binary transitions which do not involve particle evaporation , while a decreasing of this effectivity leads to quasi - equilibrium profiles whose specific form depends on the details of the dynamical equations .",
    "the analysis , developed in section [ nonhomogeneous ] , in order to take into account the effect of the nonhomogeneous character of the confining interactions for those hamiltonian systems driven by a strong chaotic dynamics , suggests the appearance of nontrivial effects of the evaporation in the spatial particles distribution .",
    "the contribution of such nontrivial effects cause a significant modification of the quasi - stationary profiles , as already shown in the context of the gravitational interaction .",
    "the above results show how difficult could be the theoretical study of the evaporation effect in a general physical background , mainly , when the equilibration mechanisms are not so effective and the dynamics is driven by the presence of long - range forces .",
