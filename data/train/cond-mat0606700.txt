    "in the last few years , a lot of effort has been invested to understand the physical properties of mnas - based thin films and multilayers .",
    "bulk manganese arsenide is ferromagnetic at room temperature with a nias hexagonal structure ( @xmath2-phase ) .",
    "@xcite at @xmath3313 k however , mnas displays a first - order phase transition that drives the system to a paramagnetic state . at this temperature ,",
    "a structural transition occurs from the low - temperature @xmath2-phase to an orthorhombically - distorted ( mnp ) @xmath1-phase . at @xmath4398",
    "k , a second structural transition takes place and the system regains a nias hexagonal structure .",
    "mnas grows epitaxially on various standard semiconductor substrates such as gaas(100 ) , @xcite gaas(111)b , @xcite gaas(110 ) , @xcite inp(100 ) , @xcite si(100 ) @xcite and si(111 ) .",
    "@xcite the excellent quality of mnas / gaas heterostructures makes this compound particularly interesting for hybrid metal / semiconductor spintronics .",
    "@xcite    the epitaxy introduces strain and defects in mnas thin films that significatively modify their structural and magnetic properties with repect to the bulk .",
    "when mnas is grown on gaas(100 ) or gaas(111)b , epitaxial strain induces an @xmath5-phases coexistence in a wide range of temperature .",
    "@xcite in addition , the @xmath6 of the thin films can be enhanced when they are grown on gaas(111)b substrates .",
    "@xcite the orientation of the gaas substrate determines the growth behavior and epilayer orientation . when grown on gaas(111)b substrate , mnas lies with the hexagonal c axis aligned with the growth direction [ fig . [ figure1](b ) ] ; @xcite while for the growth on gaas(100 ) substrate , two orientations of the epilayer have been described .",
    "@xcite by correctly adjusting the growth conditions , it becomes possible to obtain one single phase @xcite with the mnas @xmath7-axis parallel to the gaas [ 110 ] that lies inside the surface plane [ fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) ] .",
    "due to the important misfit between the thin film and the substrate ( 7@xmath8 ) , the epilayer relaxes its strain from the very beginning of the growth .",
    "above a certain thickness , the epilayer is expected to be fully relaxed at the growth temperature . however , during the after - growth cooling cycle , a residual strain is introduced due to the large dilatation coefficients difference between mnas and gaas .",
    "@xcite in fact , as the @xmath9 phase transition proceeds mainly by a 1@xmath8 lattice parameter contraction in the hexagonal plane , strain will accommodate differently for mnas / gaas(100 ) or mnas / gaas(111)b .",
    "another particularity of mnas epilayers grown on gaas(100 ) substrates is that , within the phase coexistence region , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images show the presence of stripes along the [ 0001 ] direction with two different heights , arranged alternated within the @xmath10 $ ] direction .",
    "@xcite magnetic force magnetometry ( mfm ) studies indicate that the higher stripes are ferromagnetic ( @xmath2-phase ) while the shallower are paramagnetic ( @xmath1-phase ) .",
    "@xcite x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns also agree with the @xmath2-@xmath1 phase coexistence in the 280- 314 k temperature range .",

    "instead , the surface morphology shows triangular and sticks features depending on the growth parameters like substrate temperature , as overpressure , etc . @xcite",
    "even if no stripes are visible , the phase coexistence has been unambiguously observed between 296 and 328 k by xrd for this orientation .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we perform a detailed study of the magnetism of mnas epilayers , grown on both gaas(100 ) and gaas(111)b substrate orientations .",
    "the anisotropy of the films is analyzed in terms of magneto - crystalline and substrate - induced anisotropy terms .",
    "the temperature dependence of the coercivity of the films is measured and explained in terms of thermally activated domain - wall movements and the appearance of new pinning centers .",
    "mnas epilayers are grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) with a substrate temperature of about @xmath11c on previously prepared gaas buffer layers .",
    "after removal of the native oxide , a very thin buffer layer is grown on gaas(111)b substrates @xcite while a standard 100 nm thick buffer layer is grown on gaas(100 ) .",
    "each mnas growth begins under as rich conditions on the gaas buffer layer .",
    "different epilayer thicknesses , @xmath12 , ranging from 30 nm to 200 nm , are grown on both ( 100 ) and ( 111 ) substrate orientations .",

    "magnetization vs. temperature and magnetic field curves are measured in a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) and a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( squid ) .",
    "the temperature is varied from 5 k to 300 k and the magnetic fields swept up to 5 t. the magnetization loops are measured with the magnetic field rotating in the plane of the film ( ip ) @xmath14 and in the out - of - plane geometry ( oop ) , keeping the azimuthal angle @xmath15 fixed [ fig .

    "the first term in each equation accounts for the zeeman energy and the second term includes a uniaxial anisotropy oriented in the plane of the film or out of the plane , depending on the samples substrate orientation .",
    "the last term represents the magnetostatic energy . to describe the experimental results we have included an extra anisotropy term in the m100 energy expression , @xmath25 , that favors an in - plane magnetization .",

    "das and coworkers already reported that the ferromagnetic phase is orthorhombically distorted at the coexistence region of @xmath2-mnas and @xmath1-mnas .",

    "[ figure3](b ) ] the magnetization reversal is smooth , the magnetization in m100 ones [ fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) ] shows a sharp jump at the coercive field where a partial inversion of the magnetization occurs , while higher magnetic fields are necessary to completely saturate the magnetization of the sample .",
    "the shapes of the curves are associated with domains movements and are affected both by defects and other inhomogeneities and by the anisotropy of the samples .",
    "@xcite the coercivity increases as the thickness of the films decreases , indicating that the magnetization reversal is affected by substrate - induced strains and topographic defects .    in m100 samples , the coercivity of the loops measured along the easy - axis , @xmath32 follows the condition : @xmath33 indicating that the magnetization reversal is mainly driven by domain wall movement .    in m111 samples , the in - plane anisotropy terms are much smaller and condition ( 3 ) is no longer valid .",
    "the direction perpendicular to the film surface is a very strong hard - axis due to the superposition of the magneto - crystalline anisotropy and the demagnetizing field resulting in large domain walls .",
    "for this reason we suggest that the walls in this system are nel - like , i.e. , the magnetization within the walls rotates in the film plane .",
    "a simple calculation of domain wall widths , @xmath34 , in m111 films based on the effective anisotropy of the system results in @xmath35 values . according to the nel criteria , in this case the wall mode using an in - plane rotation has a lower energy than the classical bloch mode.@xcite",
    "the in - plane angular dependence of the magnetization loops has been carefully measured by vsm .",

    "the magnetic remanence vs. the azimuthal angle , @xmath36 curves underlines the symmetry of the magnetic anisotropy of the films .",
    "m100 samples show a strong uniaxial anisotropy with a hard - axis oriented along [ 0001 ] direction .",
    "m111 samples , on the other hand , present a much weaker anisotropy contribution with different symmetries , depending on the growth conditions .",

    "as the uniaxial in - plane anisotropy is much larger than the demagnetizing term , the walls are bloch - like , i.e. the magnetization in the walls rotates out - of - the - plane of the films .",
    "even if mfm measurements have been performed at room temperature where the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 phases coexist , these results are a strong indication of the domain configuration in these samples .",
    "the @xmath36 dependence of the @xmath37 is much weaker for m111 samples and has a four - fold anisotropy in the case of the m111 - 66 film shown in fig . [",
    "figure4](b ) .",
    "the symmetry of the in - plane anisotropy in these samples can be three - fold and even two - fold and is strongly dependent on the sample growth parameters : substrate temperature during sample growth , surface stoichiometry , etc .",
    "the origin of this term may be associated to surface - induced strains and/or surface reconstruction symmetries .",
    "a study of the anisotropy of m111 ultrathin films is under progress to clarify this point .    the oop angular dependence of m100 and m111 coercive fields is shown in fig .",

    "the temperature dependence of the coercive field , extracted from loops measured with the applied field oriented along the in - plane easy - axis was examined ( fig . [ figure6 ] ) . at low temperatures , t@xmath44200 k ,",

    "@xcite at @xmath45200 k , this tendency is reversed and an increase of the @xmath37 is observed , up to @xmath46300 k. this anomalous behavior is associated to the appearance of new pinning centers .",
    "these new pinning sites would progressively appear as the temperature increases at nucleation points of the @xmath1-phase or strained regions of the @xmath2-phase .",
    "previous papers report the @xmath2-@xmath1 phase coexistence in both type of samples but at higher temperatures .",
    "@xcite    the magnetization vs. temperature curves do not show any particular feature in the t@xmath47 - t@xmath48 range ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the magneto - crystalline anisotropy decreases with temperature as the system approaches the curie temperature , t@xmath49 , @xcite without showing noticeable signatures around 200 k. therefore , the magneto - crystalline anisotropy of mnas can not be the origin of the observed effect .",
    "the m vs. t curve saturates at low temperatures to the bulk moment @xcite but an important increase of the curie temperature , t@xmath49 , from 314 k to 330 k ( m100 ) and 350 k ( m111 ) , is observed .",
    "this result suggests that the strains induced by the gaas stabilize the @xmath2-hexagonal phase up to this high temperature .",
    "in fact , x - ray @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction patterns show a @xmath2-@xmath1 coexistence in the 314 k- t@xmath49 temperature range for m111 samples . thus , in this temperature range",
    ", the magnetization would be given by the addition of an unsaturated ferromagnetic component that corresponds to the @xmath2-phase and a paramagnetic contribution , arising from the @xmath1 phase .",
    "finally , above room temperature the thermal energy overcomes the effect of the new pinning centers and induces a strong reduction of the coercive field as the temperature approaches t@xmath49 .",
    "data shown in fig . [ figure6 ] evidence that the reentrant effect is independent of the substrate orientation . the observed behavior in the coercivity",

    "the authors claim that the temperature dependence of the coercivity allows them to distinguish between homogeneous and stripes domains of @xmath2-mnas .",
    "however , stm images show that m111 samples do not form ferromagnetic stripes at room temperature .",
    "@xcite our finding of a similar behavior in both types of samples suggests that the origin of this effect does not reside in the appearance of the @xmath2-phase in the form of stripes but in the phase coexistence phenomena , beyond the epitaxy between mnas and gaas .",
    "the number of pinning centers is temperature dependent due to the progressive nucleation of @xmath1-phase regions and/or the strain evolution in the @xmath2 phase towards the phase transformation .",

    "the increase of the @xmath37 with temperature , in the t@xmath47 - t@xmath48 zone is more pronounced for thinner films .",
    "however , the functional form of the temperature variation of the coercivity does not depend on thickness .",
    "the results indicate , in summary , that even though the coercivity in this case is essentially given by extrinsic properties , the reentrant behavior seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of the magnetism of mnas thin films .",
    "we have shown that the magnetization reversal in mnas films depends on the substrate orientation and is strongly affected by the magneto - crystalline anisotropy of the compound .    on one hand , the angular dependence of the coercive field of films grown on gaas(100 ) shows that the in - plane magnetization reversal occurs by 180@xmath50 domain wall movements .",
    "moreover , the shape of the hysteresis loops indicates that the magnetization alignment with the magnetic field is driven in two - steps .",
    "this is explained by the existence of a distribution of potential barriers for domain movement , that have a very sharp threshold at the coercive field where more than 70% of the magnetization turns into the direction of the applied field .",
    "the magnetization alignment is strongly affected by the in - plane hard uniaxial anisotropy of the system , that induces the formation of bloch walls along the films .",
    "on the other hand the uniaxial anisotropy of samples grown on gaas(111)b is oriented perpendicular to the film surface , leading to the creation of nel domain walls and a smooth reversal of the magnetization in a low - field range .",
    "summarizing , we have demonstrated that the coercivity of the films presents a general anomalous behavior as a function of temperature , independent of the substrate orientation and films thicknesses .",
    "this effect is associated to the appearance of new pinning centers as a consequence of the progressive growth of a @xmath1-phase or distortion of the @xmath2-phase as the temperature is increased above 200 k.",
