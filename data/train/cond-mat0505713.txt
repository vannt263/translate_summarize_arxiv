    "the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity covers quite different situations . in the past decade , the novelty comes with the discovery of new materials where the electronic correlations are strong : organic conductor @xcite , high @xmath3 oxides @xcite , or heavy fermion systems @xcite .",
    "the localisation or the motion of the quasiparticles leads often to competing ground states with transitions from insulator to metal or from well ordered magnetic phases to a paramagnetic ( pm ) state associated or not with the appearance of superconductivity ( s ) @xcite . in these strongly correlated electronic systems ( sces ) quite different facets can be stressed : for example for superconductivity the pairing mechanism , the stability of superconductivity , the nature of the order parameter , the consequences on the low energy excitations , and the feedback on the vortex matter @xcite . here",
    "we will focus mainly on the experimental determination of the temperature ( @xmath4 ) , pressure ( @xmath5 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) phase diagram of heavy fermion compounds ( hfc ) .",
    "a new type of matter may occur at the boundary between two ground states which can be tuned under @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "in the conventional case with weak correlations between the itinerant quasiparticles , two different baths exist : the magnetism is carried by localised moments which interact weakly with the other electronic bath formed by the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "the peaceful coexistence of antiferromagnetism ( af ) and superconductivity were discovered in 1975 at the university of geneva in ternary compounds of rare earth ( re ) elements and molybdenum sulfide ( remo@xmath7s@xmath8 ) @xcite later in a serie of rhodium boride alloys ( rerh@xmath9b@xmath9 ) @xcite and more recently in re borocarbide @xcite .",
    "often most of these compounds are superconducting below a critical temperature @xmath10 k to 10 k and undergo phase transition to an antiferromagnetically ordered state at @xmath11 .",
    "the simple argument is that at the scale of the superconducting coherence length @xmath12 the cooper pair will feel an average zero magnetic field so far @xmath12 will be larger than the magnetic period @xmath13 .",
    "this length @xmath13 extends usually only to few atomic distances with also short magnetic correlation @xmath14 .",
    "the superconducting pairing leads to the so called s - wave pairing : the spin up and spin down paired electrons have zero orbital angular momentum and the mechanism of attraction is due to the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "a magnetic field can destroy singlet superconductivity in two ways .",
    "the orbital effect is simply the manifestation of the lorentz force ; the corresponding orbital limit @xmath15 at @xmath16 0 k varies as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the effective mass of the quasiparticle .",
    "the paramagnetic limitation ( @xmath19 ) occurs when a strong magnetic field attempts to align the spins of both the electrons : @xmath20 in t. in conventional superconductors , as @xmath21 due to the weakness of @xmath18 , the pauli limit is often irrelevant .",
    "however in hfc with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 the free electron mass ) , a competition will occur between the two mechanisms at least for singlet pairing .",
    "however , for triplet superconductivity with equal spin pairing between up up or down down spins , there will be no pauli limitation and superconductivity can only be destroyed by the orbital effect .    in conventional superconductors as observed in errh@xmath9b@xmath9 and homo@xmath7s@xmath8 , the superconductivity is destroyed by the onset of a first order ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the energy gained by the atoms carrying the ferromagnetic moment below @xmath24 exceeds the energy gained by the electrons as they form cooper pairs at @xmath3 .",
    "superconductivity can not prevent the magnetic transition but can only modify it slightly in a narrow temperature range .",
    "furthermore , it is very unlikely for singlet superconductivity to also survive in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state because the exchange interaction @xmath25 often forbids the formation of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion compounds are inter - metallic compounds of 4f or 5f electrons where on cooling , very large effective masses often 100 m@xmath26 appears due to the weak delocalisation of the 4f or 5f particle from its site produced by the hybridisation with the other initial light itinerant electrons ( s , p , d ) @xcite . basically on cooling below 10 k the remaining large magnetic entropy ( @xmath27 for a doublet crystal field ground state )",
    "is transferred for the formation of heavy quasiparticle with an effective low fermi temperature ( 10 k instead of 10.000 k for noble metals ) .",
    "however the duality between the localised and itinerant character leads to the competition between long range magnetic order ( af or fm ) and pm .",
    "the popular picture is that the switch at @xmath28 k will appear at a magnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) via a smooth second order phase transition .",
    "for example under pressure , that will occur at @xmath29 ( figure [ figure1 ] ) .",

    "we will not enter in the present debate on hfc descriptions .",
    "qualitatively , at least on the pm site , their properties are rather well described by an itinerant spin fluctuation approach with vanishing crossover temperatures @xmath31 and t@xmath32 where respectively fermi liquid properties are well obeyed below @xmath31 and the usual high temperature behaviour of kondo impurities is recovered above t@xmath32 . in the temperature window t@xmath33 - @xmath31 the so called non fermi liquid properties are observed .",
    "the underlining question is the location of @xmath29 by respect to the pressure @xmath34 where the 4f electrons participate ( @xmath35 ) or not ( @xmath36 ) to the fermi sea and to the pressure @xmath37 where for @xmath38 the 4f electron looses their orbital sensitivity to the local environment ( the crystal field effect ) due to the hybridisation with the other electrons .",
    "at least @xmath29 must be between @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "the physical image of hfc is that , through strong local fluctuations reminiscent of the kondo effect of a single impurity characterised by its kondo temperature ( @xmath39 ) , the renormalised band corresponds already to a heavy particle with a band mass near @xmath40 .",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations produced by the intersite coupling give only an extra factor of 2 .",
    "a strong support for this statement is that a self - consistent fit of the superconducting upper critical field @xmath41 including orbital , pauli plus strong coupling limits with @xmath42 coefficient @xmath43 indicates a moderate value of @xmath44 ie a ratio of @xmath45 .    for different cerium hfc - af",

    "a huge electronic thermal expansion occurs basically @xmath55 for @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the combined effects of large spin and density fluctuations can induce a cooper pairing with an unconventional order parameter @xcite ( at least different from the previous s wave case ) since the local strong coulomb repulsion precludes the simultaneous presence of the cooper pair on a given site : singlet d wave or triplet pairing have been reported .",

    "in this very narrow band an extra effect may occur due to the field variation of the ground state itself but also in the nature of the magnetic fluctuation .",
    "in the ( @xmath6 , @xmath5 ) phase diagram at 0 k ( figure [ figure2 ] ) , the superconducting upper critical field @xmath41 must be located by comparison to characteristic fields for the magnetism : @xmath57 for the transition from af to pm states below @xmath29 , @xmath66 inside the pm phase for the entrance in the polarised pm state ( ppm ) . above @xmath66 , the static ferromagnetic component increases continuously but the @xmath67 dependence of the dynamical response is flat .",

    "the thermodynamics of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity was often neglected for the debate on the mechanism for the superconducting pairing and on the prediction and observation of the order parameter . very often , the superconducting boundary in @xmath74 phase diagram is mainly determined by resistivity measurements .",
    "however recent specific heat @xcite and nmr experiments under pressure @xcite show clearly that the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is not a general rule whatever is the values of @xmath52 or @xmath3 . as it was done in the past @xcite and recently @xcite , the simplest approach is to consider two coupled order parameters for af and s via a coupling term of strength @xmath75 for the landau free energy . if @xmath76 , superconductivity and af compete . as indicated in figure ( figure [ figure4 ] ) , with the intensive @xmath5 variable , a bicritical point exists with a first order transition from af to s phases . if @xmath77 , a tetracritical point will occurs ( figure [ figure5 ] ) and each phase enhances the other .",

    "the intuitive idea is that if superconductivity appears first on cooling , a large gap will be open in the main part of the fs and the drop of the density of states at the fermi level is disadvantaging for af . in hfc , as the characteristic energies are low and the corresponding magnetic field ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath79 ) in the 10 t range , it may be possible to move the domain of the stability of one phase for @xmath76",

    "after the unexpected discovery of superconductivity in cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 at ambient pressure with @xmath85 k @xcite , the main steps were :    * the unusual @xmath5 dependence of @xmath3 @xcite in cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 followed by the clear evidence in cecu@xmath2ge@xmath2 that the superconductivity appearance is coupled to @xmath29 @xcite , * the discovery of the superconducting domain in cepd@xmath2si@xmath2 and cein@xmath0 centered on @xmath29 @xcite , * the high @xmath3 reached in 115 ce compounds which have a low dimensional character @xcite @xcite .",
