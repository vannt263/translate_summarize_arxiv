    "impurity - limited conductivity of a quasi - two - dimensional electron gas ( quasi-2deg ) is usually calculated by means of a quasi - classical 2d boltzmann equation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and references therein ) .",
    "quantum corrections to the 2d conductivity are assumed to be only due to the weak localization or interaction mechanisms .",
    "the starting point of the quasi - classical approach is the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 here @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a random scattering potential ; the subscript 2 denotes here and below the 2d in - plane vectors .",
    "@xmath4 is the @xmath5-th eigenenergy of the quantum well , @xmath6 , which confines the motion of the electrons in the z direction .",
    "@xmath7 is the corresponding eigenfunction .    in order to derive a quasi - classical boltzmann equation",
    "one assumes that only the highest occupied level , @xmath8 , of the potential @xmath6 is of importance and all transitions , both real and virtual , to lower or higher levels can be discarded . if @xmath9 characterizes the width of the wave function @xmath10 , then the characteristic energy interval between the state @xmath11 and the neighboring states can be estimated as @xmath12 .",
    "then the above assumption for the real transitions is justified if the channel is narrow enough and the temperature is low enough , @xmath13 .",
    "virtual transitions to other states may be caused by the random scattering potential @xmath14 .",
    "its off - diagonal matrix elements ( [ matr1 ] ) are negligible if the scattering potential is smooth , i.e. it is characterized by a large correlation radius , @xmath15 .",
    "then the scattering is responsible only for an in - plane relaxation of the electron momentum of the non - equilibrium 2deg .",
    "one may then discard any possible renormalization of the current due to an admixture of states with @xmath16 and retain only the diagonal matrix elements @xmath17 in eq .",
    ". then a quasi - classical 2d boltzmann equation follows straightforwardly .",
    "if one is interested in the profile of the current flow density along the @xmath18 coordinate , it coincides in this case with the electron density profile , determined by the wave function of the @xmath8 level , i.e. , @xmath19 , to be called below the quantum limit .",
    "the scattering potential @xmath14 induces strong transitions to other levels @xmath16 of the quantum well .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath20 with @xmath21 can not be discarded , and the conventional approach based on a quasi - classical 2d boltzmann equation is not applicable .",
    "an admixture of other states with the wave functions , localized in much wider regions than that of @xmath22 , may lead to a much broader @xmath18 profile of the current density .",

    "it may essentially exceed the width @xmath9",
    ".    the conductivity of a quasi-2deg may be now sensitive to an external in - plane magnetic field , which may influence the @xmath9 value and lead to a corresponding increase of the effective width of the channel , which carries the current flow . as a result ,",

    "it is worthwhile to distinguish this mechanism of the longitudinal magnetoresistivity from the other mechanism recently proposed in ref .",

    "the magnetic field polarizes electron spins and causes a change of the fermi energy and , hence , of the scattering time .",
    "it is emphasized that the mechanism , we propose here , does not consider electron spins or their polarization at all .",
    "it is of a crucial importance below that the system is _ quasi two - dimensional _ rather than really _ two - dimensional_.",
    "a calculation of the conductivity of a quasi-2deg in the quantum limit @xmath24 can not be carried out within the framework of a conventional quasiclassical 2d boltzmann equation .",

    "the confinement potential is harmonic , @xmath25 with the frequency @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the electron mass .",
    "we simplify the problem by assuming that only the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is occupied , @xmath28 , then @xmath29 ; @xmath30 is the amplitude of the zero - point oscillations .",
    "we assume also that electrons can move freely in the xy - plane and are scattered by a potential , which is on the average homogeneous and isotropic in the whole three dimensional space .",
    "its fluctuations are characterized by a certain correlation radius @xmath31 .",
    "this radius can be neglected as compared to any scales important for the motion in the xy plane . however , following the above discussion we shall keep a finite value of @xmath31 when considering the @xmath18 motion of the electrons . then @xmath32 here",

    "we restrict ourselves by the @xmath38- scattering in the xy - plane , which implies that the equations for the kinetic moment are decoupled from the equations for higher powers of the electron momentum . in order to receive these three equations",

    "to shorten the notations their dependencies on the variables @xmath53 and @xmath39 were suppressed .",
    "the mass operator accounting for the @xmath38 ( in the xy plane ) scattering by the potential ( [ 2 ] ) reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fourier transform of the correlation function ( [ corr1 ] ) .",
    "eq.([kineq1 ] ) is solved in the linear , with respect to the driving electric field @xmath56 , approximation .",
    "then the @xmath38 scattering means that the mass operators ( [ inter ] ) are at equilibrium .",
    "it is important now to distinguish the @xmath44 and @xmath57 dependencies of the quantities in eq.([kineq1 ] ) .",
    "we consider the case when the fermi level lies in the lowest subband of the confinement potential @xmath58 , then at equilibrium @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the equilibrium two dimensional green functions , and @xmath62 ( see discussion of the shape of the wigner quasi - distribution function of a harmonic oscillator in @xcite ) .",
    "the time @xmath63 of the electron scattering in the xy plane at equilibrium does not depend on the variables @xmath44 or @xmath53 and is defined as @xmath64 with @xmath65 .    from the principle of the detailed balance for the quantum collision integral @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that the nonequilibrium parts of the two above green functions coincide , i.e. @xmath66",
    ". however , their @xmath44 and @xmath57 dependencies do not necessarily coincide with those of the equilibrium green functions ( [ equil1 ] ) .",
    "these dependencies can be found from the integral equation , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ kineq1 ] ) .",
    "a gaussian dependence of the nonequlibrium part of the green function solves this equation .",
    "we look for a solution in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is described by eq .",
    "( [ density2 ] ) , in which the length @xmath30 is substituted for an unknown length @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath69 is the ( yet unknown ) nonequilibrium correction to the 2d green functions , eq .",
    "( [ equil1 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce all the above assumptions into the collision integral ( [ coll1 ] ) , and after some tedious but straightforward calculations arrive at the expression @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a result the kinetic equation ( [ kineq1 ] ) acquires the form @xmath73 now we compare the @xmath44 dependence of the right hand side of the kinetic equation ( [ kineq2 ] ) , determined by eq .",
    "( [ coll6 ] ) , and that of the left hand side , determined by the distribution @xmath74 .",
    "the requirement that these dependencies coincide , leads to the value @xmath75 which determines the scale of the @xmath44 dependence of the nonequilibrium green function ( [ nonequil1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath23 is now the effective width of the channel which does not necessarily coincide with the width @xmath30 of the electron density profile .",
    "one can readily see that @xmath76 only in the limit of the large correlation radius @xmath77 .",
    "however , it may become very large , @xmath78 , in the quantum limit , @xmath79 .",
    "( [ kineq2 ] ) allows one to find directly the first conditional moment of the nonequilibrium correction to the 2d - green function @xmath80 and , hence , the density of the electric current in the quasi-2deg becomes ( see eq .",
    "( 45 ) in @xcite ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the 2d - drude conductivity .    integrating eq.([current1 ] ) over @xmath44 one gets the conductivity of the quasi-2deg , @xmath83 , which strongly depends on the ratio of the width of the channel @xmath30 and the correlation length @xmath31 of the scattering potential .",
    "the drude formula is applicable , if only long range fluctuations are characteristic of the scattering potential , i.e. , @xmath77 , then @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "however , in the quantum limit , @xmath79 , when the scattering potential fluctuates in the range smaller than the width of the channel , a strong deviation from the drude formula is expected .",
    "the effective width of the channel , where the current actually flows , @xmath86 , may become much larger than the width @xmath30 of the electron density profile . as a result ,",
    "the conductivity may also become much larger @xmath87 .",
    "the above results are obtained within the linear response approximation . in order to probe the applicability limits of this approximation ,",
    "one considers the @xmath44 profile of the drift velocity .",
    "it can be found using the conditional moment ( [ green2d ] ) ( see eq .",
    "( 43 ) in @xcite ) @xmath88 this definition corresponds also to the conventional equation @xmath89 , in which @xmath90 is the electron density at equilibrium .",
    "one can readily see that differing @xmath44 dependencies of the current and the electron densities lead to a growth of the drift velocity with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "this fact indicates that at however small electric field @xmath91 , there are large enough distances @xmath44 , at which conditions can be achieved , when the linear approximation in @xmath91 is violated .",
    "the detailed analysis requires extremely cumbersome and lengthy calculations , which can not be presented here .",
    "however , the most important conclusions can be made in a simpler way .",
    "we obtain a rough but sufficient ( upper limit ) criterion of the applicability of the linear approximation by requiring that the additional energy acquired by an electron due to the current flow does not exceed the temperature , i.e. @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the fermi momentum .",
    "hence , the linear approximation is violated if @xmath94 where @xmath95 it is important to emphasize that although this condition is obtained for the harmonic potential well , considered here , its meaning is more general . for any potential",
    "well exists a value @xmath96 so that at larger distances the linear approximation does not hold . at @xmath94",
    "one has to consider a nonlinear problem involving contributions of various inelastic scattering mechanism ( say , electron - phonon interaction ) .",
    "however , without making detailed calculations one can understand that in this region the scattering becomes much stronger and the current flow profile is actually much lower , than that obtained in the linear approximation , hence , its contribution to the total current can be neglected .",
    "when integrating over @xmath44 one may just cut the integration at @xmath97 which provides reasonable estimates for the nonlinear corrections to the 2d conductivity , @xmath98 @xmath96 increases with the decreasing electric field , and at @xmath99 these corrections are hardly observable .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss here the influence of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath100 on the conductivity . according to the intuition based on the classical ideas about the electron motion",
    ", we do not expect any influence of an in - plane magnetic field , especially if it is directed _ parallel _ to the electric field . nevertheless , as we demonstrate below , such an influence exists and a positive longitudinal magnetoresistivity is expected .",
    "we have to start again from eq .",
    "( 31 ) of our paper @xcite and carry out the same procedure as described above .",
    "first , one can readily check that eq .",
    "( [ kineq1 ] ) retains its form in the case of @xmath101 and the magnetic field @xmath100 does not appear explicitly .",
    "however , it influences the shape of the equilibrium wigner function @xcite , which becomes now @xmath102 ^ 2\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is the magnetic length .",
    "we use this function in order to repeat the calculations carried above for the case of @xmath105 .",
    "the solution @xmath106 of the quantum kinetic equation will be again looked in the form ( [ nonequil1 ] ) where the function ( [ density3 ] ) with @xmath23 substituted for @xmath30 is used instead of @xmath68 .",
    "then we get an equation determining the parameter @xmath23 as a function of the magnetic field @xmath107 as a result the density of the magnetic field dependent electric current ( [ current1 ] ) in the quasi-2deg becomes @xmath108 where @xmath109 integrating eq.([current4 ] ) over @xmath44 the magnetic field dependent conductivity of the quasi-2deg is , @xmath110      figure 1 shows the relative variation of the resistivity @xmath112 as a function of the magnetic field in units @xmath113 for four values of the parameter @xmath111 : 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 .",
    "the curves for @xmath114 and 0.5 are indistinguishable in this plot .",
    "two other curves for the higher values of the parameter @xmath111 also nearly collapse . in the high magnetic field",
    "limit the resistivity rapidly decreases .",
    "it happens when the magnetic length @xmath115 becomes much smaller than the width of the channel .",
    "then the dynamics of electrons is controlled by the magnetic field and the confining potential well becomes actually irrelevant .",
    "experimentally this limit can hardly be achieved .",
    "if we take a typical width of the channel to be 100  then the high magnetic field limit is reached only in the field measured in hundreds or even thousands of tesla .",
    "it is much more realistic to expect some measurements carried out in the low field limit ( @xmath116 ) where a negative magnetoresistivity can be expected .",
    "we can write the low field expansion of the relative magnetoresisitvity as @xmath117 where @xmath118 the dependence of this coefficient on the parameter @xmath119 is nearly linear as shown in figure 2 and starts from @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "all the above data indicate that the resistivity may increase by a factor of 2 if the magnetic length @xmath115 becomes comparable with the width of the channel @xmath30 .",
    "a positive longitudinal magnetoresistivity was observed in sige layers @xcite .",
    "the authors attributed the effect to the electron spin polarization ( a theory is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "this explanation seems to be quite reasonable since the electron concentrations in these experiments are so low that a complete spin polarization is possible .",
    "the mechanism proposed in this paper may become more important at higher electron concentration .",
    "we do not know currently about any relevant experimental data and the question remains open .",
    "the results of this paper emphasize that the difference between the 2deg and quasi-2deg , however subtle it is , may be of an utter importance .",
    "if the scattering potential comprises fluctuations with a small enough correlation radius , the profile of the electron current may become broader than the profile of the electron density .",
    "a longitudinal negative magnetoresistivity is proposed as an experimentally observable consequence ."
