    "the experimental realization of graphene in 2004@xcite opened the gates to a whole scientific field of quasi - twodimensional materials with the promise of novel applications and peculiar physical phenomena by virtue of their reduced dimensionality . among these ,",
    "the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) of molybdenum and tungsten are an interesting addition due to their intrinsic semiconducting nature and high chemical stability both in bulk and few - layer phases .",
    "analogously to graphite , these materials assume a hexagonal crystal structure with stacked layers of quasi - twodimensional atomic layers that are bound together through van - der - waals forces .",
    "the strong spin - orbit interaction and missing inversion symmetry in the monolayer materials cause a significant split of the valence band edge with an associated valley pseudospin and magnetic moment .",
    "this gives rise to coupled spin- and valley physics in these materials@xcite that manifest , for instance , in optically induced spin and valley polarizations due to valley - dependent circular dichroism and a combination of the spin and valley hall effects .",
    "at the same time , being indirect semiconductors in their bulk forms , the attenuation of interlayer interaction causes a transition from indirect to direct band gap materials between bi- and monolayer tmd structures and a strong enhancement of photoluminescence quantum yield for decreasing material thickness@xcite .",
    "these findings suggest a strong light - matter interaction in these low - dimensional materials , which , apart from the insights from the scientific point - of - view , suggest possible novel applications of two - dimensional tmds in thin and flexible optoelectronic devices , such as photodiodes@xcite and photodetectors@xcite , single - photon emitters or in spin- and valleytronic devices@xcite .",
    "however , their quasi-2d nature is a double - edged sword in the sense that the low thickness limits the absorption efficiency and optical quantum yields of the tmd materials .",
    "a number of strategies have thus recently been reported to increase the light - matter interaction and thus the absorption and emission efficiency by placing tmd materials in optical microcavities and enhancing the coupling of light to excitonic@xcite or trionic@xcite dipoles through formation of cavity polaritons .",
    "another approach is tuning the light - matter interaction through resonant exciton - plasmon coupling in hybrid systems of tmds in plasmonic lattices , _",
    "e.g. _ gold nanoantennas@xcite or silver nanodisk arrays@xcite .",
    "at the heart of these interesting physics are the excited states in the form of excitons and trions .",
    "the low - dimensionality of the tmd systems allows for long - range coulomb interaction channels through the adjacent environment of reduced electric field screening and gives rise to tightly bound exciton and trion states that dominate experimental optical spectra of doped@xcite and undoped@xcite few - layer tmds and have binding energies that are an order of magnitude higher than in conventional bulk systems . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding excitonic wavefunctions are fairly extended , with radii on the order of several nm , and can be well described in the framework of mott - wannier theory@xcite .",
    "this mixed wannier - mott and frenkel character of excitons is well - known for carbon nanotubes@xcite and other two - dimensional materials@xcite .",
    "however , the low thickness renders the materials highly sensitive to the environment .",
    "another problem arises from peak broadening from the strong electron - phonon coupling@xcite and makes determination of the exciton binding energy as difference between exciton peak energy and the band edge difficult .",
    "correspondingly , the derived binding energies for the prominent sub - gap excitons in molybdenum and tungsten tmds depend highly on the details of the experimental setup and , to the best of our knowledge , experimental studies of the exciton binding energy have been so far limited to monolayer tmds . a variety of strategies for the measurement of the excitonic binding energies have been reported , including _",
    "( i ) _ application of a modified , nonhydrogenic , rydberg model to one - photon photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) spectra@xcite , and determination of the electronic band edge through _ ( ii ) _ scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts)@xcite , _ ( iii ) _",
    "photocurrent spectroscopy@xcite and _ ( iv ) _ two - photon ple@xcite spectroscopy . for monolayer mos@xmath1 ,",
    "this yielded experimental binding energies of the lowest - energy exciton between 220 and 570mev@xcite , while the reported binding energies for other monolayer mo and w dichalcogenides are typically in the range of 0.3 - 1.0ev@xcite . beyond the exciton binding energy ,",
    "several groups have reported experimental studies on the peculiar exciton and trion dynamics and the photocarrier relaxation pathways@xcite , that provide insights into the interplay of excited quasiparticles with the underlying electronic band structure .",
    "this is beneficial for understanding , _",
    "e.g. _ , the mechanism of charge separation of interlayer excitons in photodevices based on heterostructures of stacked tmd materials@xcite .    on the theoretical side , a variety of studies of the optical properties of quasi-2d tmds",
    "have been reported based on _ ab initio _ calculations employing the excitonic bethe - salpeter equation and various analytical approaches . here , a main focus was the interpretation of experimental optical spectra and the theoretical derivation of relevant exciton binding energies , bohr radii , and quasi - particle band gaps . in a similar fashion to experiments ,",
    "the reported values show a significant dependence on the computational details : the obtained binding energies of the lowest - energy exciton in mos@xmath1 and similar systems are in the range of 0.2 - 1.0ev@xcite , with the absolute peak positions moving accordingly .",
    "one cause of this significant scattering is the peculiar anisotropic screening of the coulomb interaction in two - dimensional systems that obtains a distinct dependence on the in - plane momentum transfer _ q _ in the vicinity of the _ @xmath3 _ point and requires sufficiently dense _",
    "q_-point grids or analytical modeling to yield reliable results@xcite . based on this",
    ", recent _ ab initio _ studies investigated the exciton radiative lifetimes in mos@xmath1/ws@xmath1 and mose@xmath1/wse@xmath1 heterobilayer structures@xcite and the temperature - dependent effect of electron - phonon coupling on the simulated optical spectra and obtained good quantitative agreement with experiments . on the other hand , analytic methods based on tight - binding or parametrized hamiltonians",
    "lack the flexibility of first principles approaches , but possess the necessary computational simplicity to go beyond static descriptions of isolated excitons and to study higher charge carrier complexes , such as trions@xcite and biexcitons@xcite , exciton dynamics@xcite , carrier density dependent optical spectra@xcite or the excitonic bandstructure@xcite .",
    "however , while the nature of the strongest excitonic transitions has been established for monolayer mos@xmath1 , possible effects of the changed electronic dispersions compared to monolayer mos@xmath1 from different chalcogen species ( as in mose@xmath1 and mote@xmath1 ) or interlayer interactions have so far not been addressed , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "insights into the spatial distribution of the exciton wavefunctions in monolayer and few - layer materials and the differences compared to the well - studied monolayer mos@xmath1 could contribute to the understanding of interlayer excitons in tmd heterostructures and few - layer systems and related experimental results , such as recently discovered interlayer resonant raman modes in few - layer mos@xmath1@xcite .",
    "based on theoretical simulations , we thus analyse in this paper the contribution of excitonic states to the absorption spectra in mono- and bilayer mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , and mote@xmath1 and their distributions in real and reciprocal space . we show that the changes in electronic dispersion due to interlayer interactions and different chalcogen atoms move the dominant region of band nesting between valence and conduction band and affect the composition of the dominant transitions close to the electronic band gap .",
    "further , we confirm the existence of interlayer excitons in all three bilayer materials due to the out - of - plane character of the conduction band orbitals at the band nesting points .",
    "( color online ) photoluminescence spectra of mono- and bilayer mos@xmath1 on si / sio@xmath1 substrates at an excitation energy of 2.33ev .",
    "the sharp peaks just below 2.3ev are the raman modes .",
    "the shown experimental data has been published previously in ref .  .",
    "we calculated the groundstate properties of all considered materials from density functional theory ( dft ) within the common perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) approximation .",
    "a 13x13x1 k - point sampling and normconserving pseudopotentials , including semicore states for molydenum , together with a cutoff energy of 1200ev were employed on this stage .",
    "the dft electronic bandstructure and wavefunctions served as input for the solution of the excitonic bethe - salpeter equation ( bse)@xcite on discrete 30x30 k - point samplings of the brillouin zone to obtain the dielectric functions including electron - hole effects for the studied dichalcogenides . a sufficient amount of valence and conduction bands to converge the derived optical spectra was included in the calculations .",
    "the electronic eigenvalues from dft were shifted by oneshot g@xmath0w@xmath0 quasiparticle corrections , using 24x24 k - point grids , a cutoff energy of 300ev , and 500/800 bands for the monolayer / bilayer systems .",
    "the dielectric functions and bandstructures of the monolayer systems were corrected _ a posteriori _ for spin - orbit effects following the approach in ref .  .",
    "supercells of 20x20x1 unit cells were used for the plots of the excitonic wavefunctions in real space and the position of the hole was fixed at the mo atoms in the center of this unit cell .",
    "further details and parameters for trilayer mos@xmath1 can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "while a number of groups have studied mos@xmath1 in both its mono- and bilayer forms , simulations that include electron - hole effects are to date scarce for mose@xmath1@xcite and mote@xmath1@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : absorption ] shows the obtained imaginary parts of the dielectric functions from our calculations .",
    "the spectrum of 1l - mos@xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : absorption ]  ( a ) agrees well with recent reports@xcite in both shape and energies supports our approach for the other materials as well .",
    "inclusion of electron - hole effects induces a number of prominent excitonic peaks that dominate the low - energy imaginary part of the dielectric function : the direct band gap at the _ k _ point in the brillouin zone gives rise to two peaks , _ a _ and _ b _ , that are split from the local spin - orbit coupling and form the fundamental transitions in experimental optical spectra , see fig .",
    "[ fig : expspectrum ] . we calculate a binding energy of the _ a _ exciton of 0.51ev relative to the fundamental electronic band gap of 2.69ev from our g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations , which fits well into the range of reported values for the _ a _ exciton of 0.2 - 0.57ev from experiments@xcite and to recent theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "apart from the transition forming the absorption onset , the dielectric function features a prominent peak at an energy of 2.9ev , which has been previously linked to the prominent _c_ feature in photoluminescence spectra at 2.8ev@xcite and consists of a number of strong optical excitations that we will analyse in sec .",
    "[ sec : decomposition ] .    while the obtained binding energies of the _ a _ ( and _ b _ )",
    "excitons show a good agreement with experiment , our calculations systematically overestimate the absolute peak positions , a fact that our calculations share with previous reports .",
    "we attribute parts of this overestimation to the employed g@xmath0w@xmath0 approximation ( we refer to the supplementary material for details ) and the neglect of temperature effects in our calculations .",
    "the latter have been shown recently@xcite to red - shift the predicted a and b peak positions in mos@xmath1 by about 0.1ev .",
    "the dielectric functions of 1l - mose@xmath1 and 1l - mote@xmath1 appear qualitatively similar to that of 1l - mos@xmath1 , but show more structure , with the main _c_ peak being split into a number of subpeaks of similar height , _ ca _ and _",
    "cb_. for mose@xmath1 , these two dominant subpeaks appear at energies of 2.45ev and 2.55ev , above the electronic band gap , while in case of mote@xmath1 the _ ca _ transition moves below the electronic band gap .",
    "this is accompanied by a decrease of the fundamental ( direct ) band gap along the series s@xmath2se@xmath2te due to the increase of the in - plane lattice constants .",
    "this increase weakens the hybridization of mo @xmath4 orbitals with chalcogen @xmath5 orbitals that is responsible for opening of the fundamental band gap@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the optical band gap decreases along the series as well .",
    "our g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations predict a direct band gap of 2.33ev for 1l - mose@xmath1 , resulting in a binding energy of the _ a _ exciton of 0.48ev , which is slightly decreased compared to mos@xmath1 and in good agreement with recent studies based on keldysh electrostatic potentials@xcite .",
    "the _ a _ peak appears at an energy of 1.86ev with a spin - orbit - splitting of the _ b _ peak by 166mev .",
    "these values can be compared to the recent report by ugeda _ _ et .",
    "al__@xcite , who studied layers of mose@xmath1 on bilayer graphene by sts and photoluminescence spectroscopy and bse@gw calculations .",
    "experimentally , they obtained an electronic band gap of e@xmath6=2.18ev , and an exciton binding energy of e@xmath7=0.55ev , which places the _ a_-peak position at 1.63ev .",
    "as for mos@xmath1 , our calculated exciton binding energy is thus close to experimental values , while the error in the predicted peak position appears to be contained in an overestimated g@xmath0w@xmath0 band gap compared to experiment . on the other hand , the theoretical calculations in@xcite yielded a larger exciton binding energy of 0.63ev , which compensated for the overestimated band gap ( e@xmath6=2.26ev ) and restored the experimental peak position .",
    "substrate screening was identified to be the main cause of error between theoretical and experimental values in that case and we expect this to add to previously mentioned inaccuracies due to coarse _ k_-point samplings .    for mote@xmath1 , we obtain a g@xmath0w@xmath0 band gap of 1.78ev and an _ a _ peak at 1.36ev , which , again , is about 0.2ev higher than the _ a_-peak energy of 1.1ev from photoluminescence experiments reported in a recent study@xcite . while the theoretical calculations in@xcite yielded a g@xmath0w@xmath0 band gap very similar to ours , they predicted a significantly higher exciton binding energy of about 0.6ev that led to a good agreement of the simulated and predicted a peak energies and resembles the earlier results by komsa _ _ et .",
    "the available theoretical and experimental data thus suggest a binding energy of the a exciton between 0.4 and 0.65ev .    for the bilayer materials , it is well established that stacking two layers of mos@xmath1 leads to a transition from direct to indirect semiconductor due to the additional interlayer interactions . at the same time , the direct electronic band gap decreases relative to the monolayer forms due to weaker quantum confinement of the electronic wavefunctions . for bilayer mos@xmath1 ,",
    "our g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations predict a reduction of the direct band gap to a value of 2.37ev .",
    "we note that we did not include corrections for spin - orbit interactions in the bilayer systems .",
    "this causes an underestimation of the splitting of the _ a _ and _ b _ peaks in our calculations , which arises solely from band splitting by virtue of interlayer interactions of 100mev and introduces an additional error on the band gap of order 50mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the binding energy of the _ a _ peak significantly decreases compared to monolayer mos@xmath1 to a value of 0.13ev .",
    "this places the _ a _ peak at an energy of 2.24ev , _",
    "i.e. _ slightly blue - shifted compared to the _ a _ peak in monolayer mos@xmath1 , compare to the simulated absorption spectrum of monolayer mos@xmath1 in absence of spin - orbit corrections in fig .",
    "[ fig : mos2 - 1l - a ] .",
    "this is in good agreement with a recent theoretical study@xcite and matches the slight blueshift in the experimental spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : expspectrum ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative positions of the _ a _ peaks of mono- and bilayer systems appears to depend on the sample and both spectra with blue - shifted@xcite and red - shifted@xcite bilayer _ a _ peak have been reported .",
    "we attribute the reduced binding energies of the _ a _ exciton to the proximity of the adjacent layer , which increases the screening of the coulomb interaction between the electron - hole pair .    at the same time , changes in the electronic structure due to the second layer split the high _ c _ peak from monolayer mos@xmath1 into two dominant peaks , _ c _ and _ e _ , at energies of 2.7 and 2.9ev in 2l - mos@xmath1 .",
    "we note that our calculations can only account for direct transitions and thus do not include the low - energy peak _i_ that is observed in photoluminescence spectra due to the fundamental indirect band gap in few - layer mos@xmath1 , refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : expspectrum ] .",
    "inclusion of such indirect transitions would lead to a shift of oscillation strength from the _ a _ exciton to the _i_ transition compared to our simulations .",
    "we find similar results for 2l - mose@xmath1 and 2l - mote@xmath1 .",
    "the binding energy of the _ a _ peak of 2l - mose@xmath1 greatly decreases to a value of e@xmath7=0.14ev compared to the electronic band gap of e@xmath6=2.11ev and the a peak position of 1.97ev is slightly above that of the monolayer form .",
    "the dominant _ c _ peaks from 1l - mose@xmath1 contain a significantly lower oscillation strength in 2l - mose@xmath1 in our calculations , while most of the spectral weight is shifted to a tall peak at higher energies . in 2l - mote@xmath1",
    ", the binding energy of the _ a _ exciton of e@xmath7=0.17ev continues the trend and is slightly larger than for the other two bilayer materials .",
    "a possible reason might be the increasing layer separation along the series 2l - mox@xmath1 with x = s , se , te , that is mirrored in the increase of out - of - plane lattice constants in the bulk materials .",
    "the larger layer separation might weaken the effect of an adjacent layer on the screening that counteracts and cancels the binding energy trend observed for the monolayers . in the following sections we will have a closer look on the detailed compositions of the peaks in the calculated dielectric functions .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we will start with the dielectric function in the absence of spin - orbit effects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mos2 - 1l - a ]  ( a ) . in agreement with expectations , we find that the _ a _ peak is caused by excitations from the valence band maxima at the _ k _ and _ k _ points in the brillouin zone to the lowest conduction band , see fig .  [",
