    "@xmath2 searches for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) of particle physics are ongoing at high energy and high intensity , high precision experiments , and much theoretical effort is devoted to computing the rates expected in the standard model ( sm ) or to bsm scenarios accommodating whatever anomalies exist at the time and also dark matter and neutrino masses / mixing .",
    "many  anomalies \" arose over the last decades , but no single clear conflict with the sm presently exists ( and this includes the discovery of the higgs particle at the lhc ) . some anomalies such as the high energy @xmath3 asymmetry at fermi - lab were not supported by the higher energy lhc and by further calculations of the sm expected values . in this context",
    "the excess in semitaunic @xmath4 meson decays seems to be rather unique .",
    "it has been seen in @xmath5 by both high intensity babar@xcite and belle@xcite electron positron colliders , and the @xmath6 excess was recently confirmed by lhcb@xcite in a @xmath7 times higher energy proton collider .",
    "also the heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) developed over the last decades@xcite reliably predicts the differential rates for these and other @xmath4 decays in the ( qcd corrected ) sm .",
    "in particular the @xmath8 form factors can be extracted from the measured @xmath9 with @xmath10 or @xmath11 to predict the tauonic decay rates with the hqeft fixing the form factors in terms of few model parameters@xcite .    the above and",
    "the prospect of more lhcb results for decays of non-@xmath12 meson @xmath13 flavored hadrons prompt us to further consider this anomaly .",
    "recently we became aware of the paper @xcite that addresses the issues with greater precision depth and detail and also provides an extensive bibliography and we will keep referring to this paper as we go along . in view of the importance of the general subject , the simpler version of the inclusive decay rates that we present and the different bsm model involving a charged uncolored new exchange ( rather than a leptoquark exchange ) that we emphasize , our present paper may still be useful .",
    "in the next section we present a crude yet transparent estimate suggesting that the sm is unlikely to reproduce the large measured ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the semitaunic and semileptonic modes . in sec .",
    "iii we comment on explanations of the anomaly using new particles exchanged in the various channels of the semitaunic process . in sec .",
    "iv we focus on a charged uncolored @xmath16 particle mediating only @xmath17 generation mixing .",
    "@xmath2 we do not attempt to reproduce the accurate sm calculations of the ratios of semitauonic and semileptonic @xmath4 decays @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "we believe that these calculations , building on the hqeft , are correct , though further verification by using presently much advanced lattice calculations would clearly be of great importance .",
    "it is easy to see why at the nonrecoil point the @xmath20 semileptonic transition becomes universal if the @xmath13 and @xmath21 quarks were infinitely heavy . for @xmath22 = 0 $ ]",
    ", the @xmath23 transition changes nothing for the  spectator quark \" or other light degrees of freedom of qcd which still see the same static color charge at the origin , possibly with a flipped spin .",
    "this does not change energies in this limit and the relevant form factor becomes 1 .",
    "however , to extend beyond this special point using a systematic expansion in @xmath24 , one needs the complete machinery of hqeft . while briefly described in particle data group ( pdg ) minireviews , most high energy physicists may find the actual calculations of @xmath25 shrouded in technical details and , like other monumental calculations of lattice qcd , simply take them on faith .",
    "because of their extreme importance , the following crude yet easy to follow estimate of the @xmath26 ratios may be of some use . rather than addressing separately the @xmath27 and @xmath28 cases",
    ", we will consider the ratio of the sum of the two modes in the semileptonic and semitauonic cases : @xmath29 + [ \\gamma(b\\rightarrow d^ { * } + l + \\bar{\\nu}_{l})]}.\\ ] ]    consistent values of the ckm matrix element@xmath30 were obtained by analyzing the exclusive @xmath27 and @xmath28 decay channels and independently via the inclusive semileptonic decay .",
    "the latter calculation used quark hadron duality formally referred to as the short distance expansion .",
    "it is based on the separation of time scales between the fast quark level @xmath31 transition of duration @xmath32 and the longer stage lasting @xmath33 during which the charmed quark combines with the spectator @xmath34 to form the final hadronic state .",
    "the hadronization does not affect the total inclusive decay rate which is modified , however from the zeroth order , partonic calculation by qcd corrections .",
    "these were computed to various orders and included in the above - mentioned work of freytsis - ligeti and ruderman @xcite . while these authors also used the inclusive calculation as further and less model dependent evidence , for the tension between sm calculation and the experimental measured @xmath35 and @xmath36 , our approach is simpler and different .",
    "the idea is that the inclusive @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is a charmed hadron ) or rather the ratio @xmath39 can provide an upper bound on @xmath40 .",
    "the bound is obtained by assuming that , in the @xmath41 case , the complete inclusive decay is channeled into the @xmath27 and @xmath28 final states only .",
    "the main factor fixing @xmath42(inclusive ) , where the zero index denotes the zeroth order partonic calculation of @xmath43 , is phase space which is significantly smaller for the semitauonic decay .",
    "@xmath44 or @xmath45 $ ] is the only kinematic variable relevant for the hadronization .",
    "lower @xmath44 i.e. smaller @xmath21 recoil momenta favors the formation of the ground states @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as evident from fig .",
    "[ 1b ] , the distribution of @xmath46 in the decays to final states with the heavier @xmath41 , peaks at lower values than in the @xmath47 case .",
    "this suggests a larger fraction of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the inclusive tauonic decays ( we have used the values of @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev taken from ref.@xcite ) .",
    "quark as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the color orange represents the leptonic @xmath47 cases and the blue one represents the tauonic decays.,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ] +    the ratio between inclusive semitauonic and semileptonic @xmath51 decays for the above @xmath52 and @xmath53 was very small , @xmath54 .",
    "motivated by the comments at the end of the previous paragraph , we make the extreme assumption that the semitauonic inclusive decay goes _ only _ into the @xmath27 and @xmath28 final states .",
    "this _ is not _ the case for the other semileptonic @xmath4 decays where from the pdg we find that only @xmath55 70% of the decays are into @xmath27 or @xmath28 . with the remaining 30% corresponding to higher",
    "@xmath56 , nonresonant @xmath57 or even baryonic @xmath58 states .",
    "since 100% of all the inclusive semitauonic decays go into @xmath27 or @xmath28 , this enhances @xmath40 to @xmath59 which is still much less than @xmath60 . to test for the sensitivity of the results to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we varied @xmath52 between @xmath61 and @xmath62 gev and @xmath53 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 gev .",
    "we obtained @xmath65 values ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and corresponding maximal @xmath68 between @xmath69 and @xmath70 . except for the last case ,",
    "all the @xmath68 are in disagreement with the experimental values .",
    "we note a certain part of the @xmath71 corrections is particularly pertinent to the present approach , further decreases @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath72 process , we have the distinct four body perturbative final state , where an extra gluon has been radiated , @xmath73 .",
    "we estimate that this enhancement is @xmath74 of the total inclusive decay . due to the much more dramatic decrease of the four body @xmath75 phase space with increasing lepton masses",
    ", we expect that the latter part is almost completely absent in the inclusive @xmath76 decay to charm and the massive @xmath41 lepton . thereby decreasing @xmath43 and also the maximal @xmath68 by up to an extra 10% .",
    "@xmath2 a new anomaly which appear only when all the quarks and leptons involved are members of the third generation is attractive in the framework of extradimensional theories allowing partial compositeness but only for third generation fermions@xcite .",
    "the present anomaly involves beside the @xmath13 , @xmath41 , and @xmath77 also the @xmath21 quark which up to the @xmath78 mixing is a member of the second generation .",
    "still it comes closer to the ideal third generation fermions only than all previously studied cases , in particular the @xmath79 decay involving a first generation @xmath80 quark and in which no anomaly was reported .",
    "existing and forthcoming lower bounds on masses of new particles and/or on deviations from the sm in other processes , constrain new physics interpretations of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 anomaly .",
    "we next proceed with a general phenomenological discussion ( which is less detailed and somewhat different from that of ref .",
    "the anomaly can be due to a new particle @xmath81 which interacts with the @xmath13 and @xmath21 quarks , @xmath41 and @xmath82 leptons . _",
    "a priori _ this can happen in three distinct ways :    * the @xmath81 particle could be color and charge neutral and exchanged between the @xmath13 and @xmath21 quarks and between the @xmath83 and @xmath41 ( case a ) .",
    "* the @xmath81 particle could be a leptoquark exchanging between the @xmath84 and a @xmath85 vertex or between a @xmath86 and a @xmath87 vertex ( case b ) . *",
    "the @xmath16 particle could be exchanged just like the ordinary sm @xmath88 in the @xmath89 or @xmath90 , i.e. the @xmath91 channel ( case c ) .    in case",
    "a the @xmath81 particle exchange is a new radiative correction of the ordinary weak current hadronic vertex and of the weak leptonic vertex . to explain the big @xmath35 and @xmath36 , these radiative corrections should be large , exceeding the strong qcd corrections of the hadronic vertex due to a gluon exchange .",
    "this new exchange should not occur between the first family generation .",
    "this scenario is strongly constrained by the well - established lepton universality in @xmath92 decays .",
    "a modified @xmath93 vertex will also change the rate of tau decays .",
    "thus , attributing the observed anomaly a diagonal @xmath81 coupling , which otherwise minimally affects the flavor structure of the theory , is practically excluded .",
    "case b , with the leptoquark @xmath94 particle , was discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite which found it to be the most likely explanation . as correctly pointed by the authors",
    ", this would require relatively light -o(tev ) @xmath95 and the discovery of such particles in future lhc experiments would be sensational .",
    "gev leptoquarks first arose in the framework of grand unified theories .",
    "it will be very remarkable if the eventual discovery of a far lighter leptoquark will be motivated by the much more humble @xmath13 flavor physics . ]    here we consider case c , namely the possibility of a @xmath91 channel exchange of a new charged , uncolored @xmath81 particle .",
    "this was addressed before in particular by e.g. refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that a charged scalar particle in the two higgs doublet ( 2hdm ) type ii extensions of the sm fails to reproduce _ both _ @xmath35 and @xmath96 for any combination of masses and couplings . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that it is possible to fit @xmath35 and @xmath96 with to the 2hdm type iii with some set of parameters .",
    "reference @xcite suggested that the aligned 2hdm can fit both @xmath35 and @xmath96 , but the ranges of parameters used to do this fit are in conflict with the constraints from leptonic charm decays , so they analyze the predictions of the model for observables ( @xmath41 spin asymmetry , forward - backward asymmetries , and differential decay rates ) sensitive to the charged - scalar contributions .",
    "here we focus on a vector @xmath81 particle with @xmath97 couplings to quarks and leptons .",
    "as noted by ref.@xcite this simplifies the analysis since the new bsm amplitude has the same form as the ordinary @xmath98 exchange and generates the same four - fermi effective lagrangian with a new fermi constant , @xmath99 the large electron positron collier ( lep ) bound ( @xmath100 gev from pair productions ) is likely to be improved by the lhc .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath101 pair production rates are smaller than those of pairs of leptoquarks ( @xmath102 ) by a factor of @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , we expect that the new bounds on @xmath104 which at present are of order 200 gev will be significantly weaker than those for leptoquarks .",
    "this may allow such particles to play the large role required to explain @xmath68 and is an important motivation to consider the following toy model .",
    "@xmath2 we next proceed to discus a toy model involving second and third generations only , which is based on the exchange of a charged , color neutral , vector @xmath105 particle in the @xmath91 ( @xmath106 ) channel .",
    "many bsm extensions modifying the flavor structure lead to excessive fcnc transitions and in particular to large @xmath107 and @xmath108 mixing . to avoid an @xmath81 particle tree - level exchange from generating this most acute mixing problem",
    ", we endow our @xmath109 particles with conserved generation numbers .",
    "specifically we denote the required @xmath81 boson as @xmath110 .",
    "this refers to the second and third generations each including a quark and lepton @xmath111 doublets .",
    "thus , we denote @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 and also @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119",
    ". our proposed @xmath81 particle can generate the quark @xmath120 transition and its conjugate can generate the leptonic @xmath121 transitions .",
    "thus , in our model the new bsm contribution involves a different final state @xmath122 rather than @xmath123 which is emitted in standard model @xmath98 exchange .",
    "clearly the experiments where the @xmath124 anomalies were discovered can not distinguish neutrinos with different flavors .",
    "however , an important consequence is that in the present approach the sm and bsm amplitudes do not interfere and the ratio of their contributions is @xmath125^{4},\\ ] ]    so that @xmath126^{4}$ ] . in order to explain the observed anomaly",
    ", the last ratio should be about @xmath127 , and finally we obtain the condition @xmath128 the fact that the present lower bounds on @xmath104 are very low is very helpful in satisfying this constraint , e.g by choosing @xmath129 gev and @xmath130 .",
    "the weak @xmath131 symmetry that should be respected implies that our charged @xmath110 is accompanied by a neutral @xmath132 .",
    "this neutral @xmath133 particle is the middle member of an @xmath134 triplet .",
    "its third member is @xmath110 , @xmath135 the linear combination @xmath136 is orthogonal to the middle member of the triplet and is a singlet of weak isospin .",
    "a key point is that the neutral @xmath133 do not mediate @xmath137 mixing as can be readily verified by following the 2,3 generation indices .",
    "however , they do generate fcnc transitions .",
    "in particular the neutral member of the triplet @xmath138 will generate both @xmath139 and the dramatic flavor changing @xmath140 transitions which will be @xmath141 . using the pdg upper bound @xmath142 on the branching of @xmath143 and of @xmath144",
    ", we estimate the inclusive @xmath145 to be less than @xmath146 .",
    "this implies the constraint @xmath147 notice that once @xmath148 , the last condition is satisfied .",
    "further , if the bound on @xmath139 is saturated we expect a similar slightly smaller rate due to the phase space reduction for the inclusive @xmath140 which should be experimentally looked for .",
    "thus we predict an inclusive decay rate @xmath149 which is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "weak isospin symmetry implies the same @xmath151 as in the previous equations .    up to now",
    "we have considered the minimal set of extra particles that @xmath152 requires once we have the @xmath153 boson mediating the bsm contribution explaining the observed excess of the @xmath154 . while we imposed the necessary equality of the couplings of these we had to assume a mass ratio of @xmath155 the neutral to charged member of the resulting @xmath156 triplet .",
    "one may want to extend the set of new particles by imposing a @xmath157 family symmetry and use the @xmath158 generator operating on our @xmath153 boson to predict two new particles of the form @xmath159 @xmath160 . these generation diagonal bosons of mass @xmath161 do not generate new fcnc transitions . however , they add a coherent contribution to the charged @xmath162 of size @xmath163 with @xmath164 the sm , @xmath88 exchange contribution . by assumption",
    "there is no analog contribution to the leptonic @xmath41 decay to electron and neutrinos . using the ratio @xmath165 required to fit the @xmath26 anomaly",
    ", we find that a ratio of @xmath166 of the masses is enough to avoid violation of the relatively well experimentally verified lepton universality of the @xmath41 decay in the first and second generation of families .    for completeness",
    "we indicate in fig [ fd1 ] the set of 16 bosons of the form @xmath167 that are generated by repeating operations like the above and which form a @xmath168 @xmath169 representation . as indicated no new types of transitions",
    "are then generated except for the completely ( generation and weak isospin ) diagonal transition due to the 4 mesons , which we refer to as @xmath170 , in the center of our figure .",
    "since the latter are of the same type as those considered in case a , we need to impose on their masses an even stronger constraint than above namely @xmath171 tev .",
    "so far we have only addressed possible difficulties associated with the newly introduced @xmath81 particle sector on its own . to avoid difficulties with other precision measurements we had to impose a 1:3:6:10 hierarch between the masses of the required @xmath105 , its weak isospin @xmath172 partner , the generation neutral @xmath173 and the completely generation and @xmath111 diagonal @xmath174 .",
    "it seems difficult to explain the large @xmath156 breaking manifest via the @xmath175 mass difference mass difference does not violate @xmath156 because it originates from higgs coupling between left and right quarks where the latter are @xmath156 singlets . to have a remotely related scenario here",
    "we should involve also right - handed @xmath81 particles as well . ] .",
    "we also need to address the all important issue of the breaking of flavor symmetries by the higgs couplings .",
    "these were reflected in the quark and lepton spurions in the paper of ref.@xcite .",
    "while it is conceivable that our model when fully implemented with its own new higgs sector will be able to generate the magic of gim - like mechanism avoiding _ all _ the possible dangerous resulting fcnc , this seems rather unlikely . discussing this alternative , less dramatic than the leptoquark explanation , is still very useful @xcite",
    ".     combinations .",
    "the particle at the upper left corner of mass @xmath176 is the one we need to mediate the extra incoherent contribution @xmath177 .",
    "the @xmath172 particle of mass @xmath178 at the middle of the left edge is obtained from the initial @xmath105 by a weak isospin lowering operation .",
    "to each particle corresponds a conjugate particle mediating the reverse reaction obtained by a @xmath179 and @xmath180 reflection through the origin of the square .",
