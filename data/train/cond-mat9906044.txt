    "the nonlinearity ( power dependence ) of the microwave ( rf ) surface impedance @xmath4 of the high-@xmath5 superconductors is important for both practical applications and fundamental materials understanding .",
    "nonlinearity in the surface impedance not only degrades the power handling ability of devices but also causes intermodulation and harmonic generation problems at moderate power levels . there has been a large amount of effort to investigate the nonlinear @xmath4 , but the origins of these phenomena are still not understood . since most of the measurements have been performed on photolithographically patterned stripline or coplanar waveguide devices , one of the suggested explanations for the nonlinearity is defects and damage caused by patterning .",
    "all patterned devices have some current crowding near their edges . for example",
    ", stripline and microstrip devices have current distributions that peak sharply near their edges , where the patterning processes have a relatively large influence .    a sem picture focusing on the edge of a patterned ybco thin film is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the edge is not straight as can be seen in the picture and the roughness of the edge is of the order of a superconducting penetration depth .",
    "this edge roughness results from the initial imperfections of the photoresist pattern and from nonuniformities of the etching process .",
    "the edge roughness led to the speculation that the condition of the ybco line edge was influencing the power dependence , and this was the initial motivation for this work .",
    "the bright particles on the surface of the ybco film are the well - known copper oxide outgrowths that are present in all films whose stoichiometry is not exact@xcite .",
    "we have found that outgrowths do not adversely affect the microwave properties and therefore it is unnecessary to make large efforts to deposit films with exactly the correct stoichiometry .",
    "we have also observed that improvement of the surface morphology to make smoother films than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] does not improve their microwave properties either with regard to their residual @xmath0 or their power dependence .",
    "in the present work , we used both a sapphire dielectric resonator and a stripline resonator to directly compare the power dependence of the microwave surface resistance @xmath0 of the _ same ybco thin films , first unpatterned in the dielectric resonator and then patterned in the stripline resonator .",
    "experimental procedures and results are shown in the following sections . to help understand our experimental results better ,",
    "we have also modeled the @xmath0 as measured in the dielectric resonator and in the stripline resonator using the following simple phenomenological assumption , @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the real part of the complex local resistivity and penetration depth , @xmath10 is the local current density in the film , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the corresponding nonlinear coefficients . _",
    "in order to study the effects of defects and damage introduced in the patterning process on the power dependence of the microwave surface resistance of ybco thin films , we measured the nonlinear microwave frequency surface resistance at 10.7ghz of unpatterned , 2-inch - diameter , ybco films using a specially designed sapphire dielectric resonator .",
    "the unpatterned films were then patterned using standard photolithography and wet chemical etching with 0.1% phosphoric acid to make stripline resonators with resonant frequencies @xmath13 = @xmath14@xmath15 , where @xmath16 , ... and @xmath15 = 1.5ghz .",
    "the patterning and dicing procedures are described in fig .",
    "the microwave surface resistance was then measured as a function of rf power for the patterned striplines .",
    "comparing our results `` before '' and `` after '' the patterning process , directly clarifies whether the patterning contributes to the power dependence of the microwave surface resistance observed for ybco thin films .",
    "we have designed a sapphire dielectric resonator shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] to measure the microwave surface resistance and especially the power dependence of unpatterned ybco thin films .",
    "the resonator incorporates some unique features described below that allow high - power measurements to be carried out without heating the sample via dissipated power .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] is a cut - away view of the dielectric resonator .",
    "the resonator was made from a @xmath17-inch - diameter and @xmath18-inch - high cylindrical sapphire puck that is grounded by two 2-inch - diameter ybco wafers ( see left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the resonator has fixed output coupling and in - situ - adjustable input coupling to ensure critical input coupling ( no reflection at the input end ) for high - power measurements .",
    "the resonator is packaged in an oxygen - free copper case , as shown in fig .",
    "special thermal contacts were designed to avoid heating problems for high - power experiments .",
    "a copper pressure plate was employed on top of the upper ybco wafer .",
    "springs were used ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) to ensure that the pressure on the ybco is independent of temperature .",
    "a gold - plated copper foil was soldered onto the copper pressure plate to enhance thermal conduction to the copper case from the top ybco film which was more likely to be affected by heating than the bottom wafer that was anchored to the copper base plate .",
    "thermal - conducting grease was applied between the sapphire puck and the two grounding wafers .",
    "the whole package was operated in a vacuum environment in a cryocooler with the bottom plate bolted to the cold finger with an indium foil for thermal contact .",
    "a temperature sensor and a 25-@xmath19 heater were mounted on the copper case of the resonator with indium foil to monitor and control the temperature .",
    "the sapphire dielectric resonator was operated at the @xmath20 mode for which the center frequency was 10.7ghz .",
    "the loaded quality factor @xmath21 , reflection ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and transmission ( @xmath24 ) coefficients were measured as a function of input power and temperature .",
    "the input coupling loop was tuned in - situ to maintain critical coupling at each temperature and input power level .",
    "critical coupling on the input maximizes the circulating power and rf magnetic field in the resonator .",
    "the output coupling loop was fixed and weakly coupled during each measurement .",
    "the unloaded quality factor @xmath25 was obtained from the measured @xmath26 parameters and @xmath21 , and the surface resistance was deduced from @xmath0 = @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the calculated geometric factor of the resonator.@xcite the results for @xmath0 are presented as a function of peak magnetic field in the resonator . the @xmath0 measured by this method is the average of @xmath0 in the top and bottom ybco films .",
    "the @xmath21 was measured using a standard frequency - domain 3-db bandwidth method at a low input power where the @xmath29 is independent of power . at higher input power levels ,",
    "a time - domain method was employed to reduce heating effects . in this method , a cw microwave pulse with enough duration to fully charge the resonator was sent into the resonator . after the input pulse is turned off , we can calculate @xmath21 from the decay rate of the output signal that is proportional to @xmath30 $ ] . by use of the time - domain method with this special thermal design , the @xmath0",
    "could be measured without heating problems for input powers up to 40dbm , which corresponds to a rf peak magnetic field of @xmath31100oe .",
    "surface resistance measurements on two pairs of unpatterned ybco films were carried out for temperatures in the range 30 to 80k .    in the analysis of the experimental data",
    ", we have , as is usual , treated the losses of the ybco superconducting ground planes as a perturbation that does not affect the field or current distribution , while ignoring the losses due to the sapphire puck itself and to the copper case . the assumption that only the ybco films contribute to the power loss is expected to be valid for the following reasons .",
    "a good - quality sapphire crystal is almost lossless at the cryogenic temperature where we operated , since the @xmath32(loss tangent ) is estimated@xcite to be on the order of @xmath33 . for ybco films ,",
    "a @xmath25 of about @xmath34 is observed at low temperatures .",
    "a pair of 2-inch - diameter nb films have yielded @xmath25 values greater than @xmath35 . that the nb films gave a higher @xmath29 than those of ybco indicates that the loss in the sapphire puck is negligible compared to that of the ybco films .",
    "we estimated that the loss in the copper case is very small and yields a @xmath29 greater than @xmath36 , much higher than that of the ybco films .",
    "after the microwave surface resistance of the unpatterned ybco films was measured with the sapphire dielectric resonator , the films were patterned and stripline resonators were made .",
    "a standard patterning process with wet chemical etching was employed . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , each 2-inch wafer was made into four striplines and four ground planes .",
    "one piece from each of the top and the bottom ybco wafers used with the dielectric resonator in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] was measured .",
    "a description of the stripline resonator used here can be found in detail elsewhere.@xcite similar to the dielectric resonator method , the loaded quality factor @xmath21 was measured for the stripline as a function of microwave input power up to 35dbm , corresponding to a rf peak magnetic field of 1000oe in the resonator .",
    "one advantage of the stripline resonator is that the @xmath0 at different overtone frequencies can be easily measured . by measuring overtones",
    ", we could measure the @xmath29 at frequencies close to that of the dielectric resonator even though the fundamental resonance of the stripline resonator is 1.5ghz .",
    "the @xmath0 as a function of rf peak magnetic field @xmath37 at different temperatures was measured for two pairs of unpatterned ybco films , denoted as pair 1 and 2 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for pair 1 , no nonlinearity in @xmath0 of the unpatterned wafers",
    "was observed up to 80k even at + 40dbm , the maximum available power , and corresponding to @xmath38 values up to 200oe . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath0 obtained for the unpatterned wafers is an average surface resistance of the pair of films .",
    "figure  [ fig6](a ) compares @xmath0 of the unpatterned and patterned films at 35k for pair 1 .",
    "the open circles represent the @xmath0 of the patterned film from the top wafer measured in the dielectric resonator , and the crosses denote the @xmath0 of the patterned film from the bottom wafer .",
    "the average of those two curves ( dashed line ) agrees with the @xmath0 of the unpatterned wafers very well and suggests that there is no nonlinearity for @xmath37 up to 500oe .",
    "figure  [ fig6](b ) shows the results at 75k for pair 1 . for the case of stripline resonators , because of package modes interfering with some of the overtone modes , the @xmath0 could not be measured at the mode closest in frequency to that of the dielectric resonator",
    ". therefore @xmath0 was measured at the closest frequencies possible .",
    "the results for @xmath0 were then scaled assuming @xmath0 @xmath39 @xmath40 . for pair 1 the @xmath0 of the unpatterned films",
    "was measured at 10.7ghz , and the @xmath0 of the two patterned films was measured at 12ghz and 7.5ghz .    from the results in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we conclude that for pair 1 , no degradation in the residual surface resistance was observed in the patterned stripline films up to a @xmath37 of @xmath41 200oe .",
    "no power dependence was observed up to the maximum input power available for the unpatterned films , and no effects of patterning on the power handling of ybco films could be found either at 35k or at 75k for pair 1 .",
    "we grew another pair of 2-inch - diameter ybco wafers pair 2 , under a different deposition temperature with the intention to decrease the power handling of the microwave surface resistance .",
    "for pair 2 at 35k no power dependence of the @xmath0 was observed in the dielectric resonator up to the maximum input power , similar to the results obtained for pair 1 .",
    "however , at @xmath42 75k , a nonlinearity in the @xmath0 was observed above @xmath37 @xmath41 100oe .",
    "results for the patterned films are shown together with that of the unpatterned films in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 was measured at 7.5 ghz for both patterned films in the stripline resonator .",
    "the measured residual surface resistance of the unpatterned and patterned films agrees to within 10@xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 for the unpatterned films actually turns up at a somewhat lower @xmath37 than for the patterned films in the stripline resonator .",
    "the apparently better power handling of the stripline resonator can be explained using the same surface impedance by a simple model introduced below .",
    "the @xmath45 is the rf peak magnetic field in the two types of resonators , but the two types of resonators have very different field distributions . in the next section ,",
    "we use the different current / field profiles for both the sapphire dielectric and stripline resonators to model the measured power dependence of the unpatterned and patterned films .",
    "the current profiles in the films for the dielectric and stripline resonators are different , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for the dielectric resonator with a film diameter much larger than the diameter of the sapphire puck so that the edge effects can be ignored , the current density @xmath46 is in the @xmath47 direction and has a dependence on radius given by@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are various bessel functions , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants determined by the geometry of the resonator , _ a is the radius of the sapphire puck and @xmath56 is the radius of the superconducting films . the current density",
    "thus peaks near the center of the film as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . for the stripline resonator",
    ", the current density @xmath46 has been calculated numerically in ref . for the purpose of simplicity in the calculation",

    "this analytical approximation agrees with the numerically calculated current distribution to within 5@xmath43 in our case .",
    "thus @xmath57 peaks sharply at the edges of the patterned film for the stripline resonator . for the dielectric resonator ,",
    "as is obvious in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.3 ] ) , @xmath57 is related directly to the rf peak magnetic field @xmath37 . for the stripline resonator",
    ", @xmath37 can be calculated numerically from the current distribution in the stripline.@xcite for the same maximum field @xmath37 in the dielectric and stripline resonators , the portion of the film carrying a high current density is larger for the dielectric resonator due to the broader peak in the @xmath61 distribution of the dielectric resonator .",
    "therefore an apparently better power handling in the stripline resonator is not surprising . _",
    "the quality factors @xmath25(@xmath37 ) and in turn @xmath0(@xmath37 ) of both resonators have been modeled as a function of rf peak magnetic field using the current distributions given above , with the assumption for the impedance is given by eqs .",

    "these parameters were taken to fit the @xmath0 obtained from the dielectric resonator measurements . the unloaded quality factor for the stripline resonator",
    "was then calculated with the same set of parameters . at low rf field ,",
    "calculated values of @xmath25 of @xmath72 and 6000 , respectively , were obtained for the dielectric and stripline resonators , and these values are consistent with the measured values .",
    "the modeled results also show that the power dependence of @xmath0 for both the dielectric and stripline resonators is quantitatively consistent with the measured power dependence for both resonators .",
