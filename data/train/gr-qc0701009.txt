    "scalar  tensor gravity ( stg ) has become a major area of activity in the last thirty years .",
    "this is due mainly to the discovery of several shortcomings of general relativity ( gr ) in cosmology and quantum field theory .",
    "in fact , the presence of a big bang singularity , the flatness and horizon problems , led to the realization that the  standard \" model for cosmology @xcite , based on gr and the standard model of particle physics , is not able to describe the universe in extreme regimes . on the other hand , gr is a _ classical _ theory which has so far eluded every attempt to be quantized , making the description of gravity on microscopic scales very difficult .",
    "this has led many authors to believe that the standard einstein scheme is inadequate to fully describe the gravitational interaction at a fundamental level @xcite and has stimulated the proposal and the study of alternative theories of gravity that might be able to solve these problems and at the same time reduce to gr in the weak field regime .",
    "one of the most fruitful theories of this type is stg , in which scalar field(s ) that are non  minimally coupled to gravity are introduced .",
    "these type of theories were proposed nearly half a century ago by jordan @xcite and later refined by brans and dicke @xcite . the original motivation behind brans - dicke theory ( bd ) came from mach s principle , but over the years , bd and stg have gained interest in a wide number of scenarios . for example , in unification schemes such as superstrings , supergravity or grand unified theories , the one  loop or higher  loop corrections in the high  curvature regime take the form of non  minimal couplings to the geometry or higher  order curvature invariants in their low energy effective actions @xcite .",
    "in cosmology , stg acquired considerable interest because they introduce naturally scalar fields and scalar fields which are capable , among other things , of giving rise to inflationary behaviour @xcite . in gr the introduction of this type of field",
    "has the drawback of raising the issue of explaining its origin .",
    "instead , in stg this problem finds a natural solution , because the scalar field can be considered an additional degree of freedom of the gravitational interaction . for these reasons , among others , inflationary models based on stg have been widely studied @xcite .",
    "recently , stg has also been used to model dark energy , because scalar fields are also the natural candidates for phantom and quintessence fields ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this suggests that both inflation and dark energy could be the result of the action of the same scalar field .",
    "stg offers , in this sense , the ideal framework to implement this intriguing idea and might even allow us to overcome the problems due to the energy scale difference between the dark energy scalar fields and the inflaton @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the problem of determining the global dynamics of friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) cosmologies of stg .",
    "we will study a generic class of stg theories , where quadratic non ",
    "minimal couplings to gravity and self  interaction power ",
    "law potentials are assumed .",
    "this class of models is strictly related to the string dilaton action and naturally exhibit duality in the cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can be obtained from generic non  minimally coupled scalar ",
    "tensor lagrangians if noether symmetries are found in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "several exact solutions of these models have been found , but the stability and global behaviour is still not well understood .",
    "our aim is to give a full description of the global dynamics of this class of stg and determine if cosmic histories are possible that ( i ) present a transient matter ",
    "dominated friedmann phase and then evolve towards an accelerated ( dark energy  dominated or @xmath3cdm ) regime or ( ii ) present a first unstable inflationary phase and a second inflationary attractor .",
    "the dynamical systems approach has been already used with great success in bd @xcite , in specific models of stg @xcite and in other contexts @xcite allowing the derivation of new exact solutions and making possible a qualitative global description of the dynamics .",
    "the geometric structure and dimensionality of the phase  space of general couplings and potentials has recently been investigated by faraoni @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the field equations and discuss the non  minimal coupling and the self  interacting potential .",
    "the cosmological equations for a flrw metric are derived in section 3 .",
    "we convert them into an autonomous dynamical system in order to pursue a phase  space investigation .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are respectively devoted to the analysis of this system in the absence and presence of a perfect fluid source .",
    "we study the stability of the fixed points with the aim of identifying physically interesting cosmological behaviours . in section 6 ,",
    "the results are discussed and some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the following conventions are adopted : the metric signature is @xmath4 ; latin indices run from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the covariant derivative ; physical units @xmath8 are used .",
    "in four dimensions , a general action in which gravity is non  minimally coupled to a scalar field @xmath9 , reads @xcite : @xmath10 , \\label{action : f(phi)}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a generic coupling , @xmath2 is the self  interaction potential and @xmath12 is the matter lagrangian .    by varying the action ( [ action : f(phi ) ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath13 , we obtain the field equations @xmath14 and the variation with respect to @xmath9 gives the klein - gordon equation @xmath15 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "the field equations can be recast in the standard form @xmath16 where the effective stress - energy momentum tensor @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{stress_energy : effective}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form of the equations shows clearly one of the most interesting features of scalar tensor gravity : the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath19 , intended as the coupling of gravity with standard matter , has to be replaced by an effective gravitational `` constant '' @xmath20 that depends on the non  minimal coupling @xmath21 ( and , as a consequence , on @xmath9 ) and _ varies _ in time .",
    "the bianchi identities @xmath22 give the conservation laws for both the matter and the scalar field .",
    "as a general result @xcite , it is possible to show that the conservation law for the scalar field is the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the action ( [ action : f(phi ) ] ) is very general and contains several interesting physical cases .",
    "for example , considering the transformation @xmath23,\\quad f(\\phi ) \\,\\rightarrow",
    "\\,\\frac{1}{2}\\exp[-2\\psi],\\quad v(\\phi ) \\,\\rightarrow \\,\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda\\exp[-2\\psi],\\ ] ] which specifies a particular form of coupling and potential , leads to the 4d - string - dilaton effective action @xmath24 , \\label{action : string}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the string charge . in this context , such a theory is nothing else but a particular stg @xcite .",
    "this means that the considerations and results for the action ( [ action : f(phi ) ] ) , and the related dynamics , also hold for string - dilaton cosmology .",
    "on the other hand , the set of transformations @xmath25 give rise to the action @xmath26 , \\label{action : bd}\\ ] ] which is nothing else but the bd action constant . ]",
    "in addition to the ones above other interesting kind of transformations are possible @xcite .    in this paper , we will focus on models where the non  minimal coupling has the form @xmath0 and the self - interaction potential is taken to be an arbitrary power law of the form @xmath1 .",
    "this choice is general and motivated by several mathematical and physical reasons . in particular , beside the string - dilaton and bd actions , several effective quantum field theories , in low energy physics , can be related to such couplings and self  interacting potentials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this coupling and potential satisfy the requirement of noether symmetries for the lagrangian in ( [ action : f(phi ) ] ) , giving rise to general exact solutions of physical interest @xcite .",
    "a final remark concerns the parameters of the theory .",
    "very different models can be parameterized by the set @xmath27 , but not all the combinations of these parameters are necessarily physical .",
    "for example , attractive gravity is achieved for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , although physically interesting situation can also be achieved for @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider only the physical case @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the discussion of the other interesting combinations of parameters can be found in @xcite .",
    "in order to analyze the phase - space of the scalar tensor flrw cosmologies , the field equations need to be recast in a dynamical system form . in the flrw metric and with our choice of coupling and potential",
    "the the above einstein - klein - gordon equations reduce to : @xmath32 where the first is the cosmological equation for the acceleration , the second is the hamiltonian constraint , i.e. the @xmath33 equation , and the third is the klein - gordon equation .",
    "@xmath34 is the hubble parameter and @xmath35 is the spatial curvature constant .",
    "we have also assumed standard matter to be a perfect fluid with a barotropic index @xmath36 , so that the conservation equation yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the the matter - energy density . in",
    "what follows , since we want to stress the role of a non minimally coupled scalar field in the modelling of dark energy , we will consider only @xmath39 .",
    "other values of these parameters , which can be associated with more exotic forms of matter energy densities , although interesting , will not be considered here .    the equations above can be converted into an autonomous system of first - order differential equations by defining the following set of expansion normalised variables : @xmath40 from which we obtain @xmath41 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\fl y'=\\frac{2y}{12\\xi-1}\\left[24\\xi-1 + 12\\xi k + 4x+(12\\xi-1)(n-2)x\\right .",

    "the task is now to study the structure of such a space : this means finding the stability of the fixed points , and then to analyze the evolution of trajectories @xcite .",
    "we will consider two cases : the vacuum case ( @xmath44 ) and the matter case ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "when we consider the vacuum case ( @xmath44 ) , the set of dynamical equations reduces to @xmath46 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace{-15 mm}y'=\\frac{2y}{12\\xi-1}\\left[24\\xi-1 + 12\\xi k + 4x+(12\\xi-1)(n-2)x\\right .",

    "the fixed points can be obtained by setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the system",
    "we obtain five fixed points ( see table [ t : fixed_vac ] ) .",

    "the stability of the fixed points can be determined by evaluating the eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix associated with the system ( see table  [ t : eigenvalues_vac ] ) , as prescribed by the hartman - grobman theorem @xcite .",
    "the fixed point @xmath53 is a saddle for every value of the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the point @xmath56 can either be a stable node or a saddle node whereas @xmath57 is either an unstable node or a saddle node , depending on the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath58 and @xmath60 are both dependent on @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that the stability varies over the different ranges of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "the possibility that scalar tensor gravity could converge to gr has been proposed within the context of extended inflation first using numerical techniques @xcite and than with a more formal proof @xcite .",
    "the dynamical system approach allows one to see this phenomenon in a very clear way , even in the more general case of a non - zero potential .",

    "in fact , a quick look to the table above reveals that there is no value of the parameters for which any of the finite fixed points are stable .",
    "this means that the only non - vacuum attractors for this class of theories are the asymptotic fixed points and their associated lematre solution .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the class of cosmologies we treated are doomed either to approach an effectively vacuum state ( probably corresponding to thermal death ) that corresponds to one of the vacuum attractors or to recollapses towards a big crunch .",
    "the most interesting orbits are the ones that  travel \" between point @xmath60 and @xmath209 .",

    "the second ones are interesting because they potentially unify  dark \" scalar fields and the inflaton within a single scheme .",
    "since the phase space is three dimensional it is not easy to check if such orbits actually exist without the use of numerical techniques .",
    "however , our results allow one to give some necessary condition for these orbits to exist and to rule out some of them .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that there is no value of the parameters for which @xmath60 can represent an unstable friedmann solution and @xmath209 an inflationary phase .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath358 and @xmath359 we have that @xmath209 corresponds to an unstable decelerated expansion , @xmath60 correspond to a stable power law inflation and these points are not separated by any invariant submanifold .",
    "this means that , in principle cosmic histories exist for which a transient friedmann evolution approaches to a power law inflationary phase in a natural way .    if @xmath360 and @xmath359 another interesting set of cosmic histories is possible in which we have two inflationary phases , a first one which is unstable associated with @xmath209 and a second one which is stable associated with @xmath60 .",
    "although only a detailed analysis of these cosmic histories can reveal if this last group of cosmic histories also include the deceleration phase necessary for the realization of standard cosmology , this scenario is interesting because it shows that in stg the non  minimally coupled scalar field can act as _ both _ the inflaton and dark energy . such a behavior has been also found in a class of higher order gravity models @xcite and definitely deserves a more careful investigation .",
    "such a study , will be the topic of a a forthcoming paper .    as final comment , it is worth stressing the connection between the model presented above and the string - dilaton action . using the transformation ( [ trasf : string ] ) , which is only a reparametrization for the scalar field , we can pass from the action to .",

    "therefore , our analysis also allows us to give details of the dynamics of low - energy string cosmology which could be of great interest in the quest for finding observational constraints for this theory .",
