    "one of the most remarkable phenomena observed in high-@xmath4 cuprates is the opening of a pseudo gap above the superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature ( @xmath4 ) in excitations of charge as well as spin . to elucidate the basis of this effect ,",

    "nevertheless , the microscopic origin of the pseudo gap remains controversial .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed based on preformed cooper pairs or sc pairing fluctuations [ 9 ] , the rvb state [ 10,11 ] , a precursor to a spin - density - wave - state [ 12 ] and the formation of dynamical charge stripes . to reduce the considerable theoretical and experimental confusion regarding the basis of the spin pseudo gap , further experimental studies are required .    in principle ,",

    "especially , neutron scattering spectroscopy has the unique benefit of being able to detect directly the energy gap as well as the momentum dependence of spin fluctuation .",
    "in fact , neutron scattering measurements on the @xmath8 ( ybco ) system observed for the first time a gap - like structure in the energy spectrum of dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath9 near the ( @xmath10 ) position in the normal state [ 8 ] . for underdoped @xmath0 ( lsco ) , however , no evidence for the existence of a pseudo gap in the normal state nor for a spin gap in the sc state has been obtained [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "in contrast , recent neutron scattering studies of optimally or slightly overdoped lsco have revealed a well - defined energy gap in the incommensurate spin fluctuations below @xmath4 [ 14 - 17 ] .",
