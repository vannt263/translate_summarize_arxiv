    "the increase of the solubility of nonpolar compounds in water on lowering the temperature , @xmath0 , is a well known phenomenon @xcite which recently received attention from the molecular simulation community @xcite .",
    "the existence of closed demixing regions in the temperature - concentration phase diagrams characterized by the presence of a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) below which the components mix in all proportions is also well known for aqueous solutions of polymers and large organic molecules @xcite and is explained by the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of solvent and solute @xcite .",
    "the same effect , increase of solubility of the hydrophobic side chains on lowering t , may be relevant for understanding the remarkable phenomenon of cold denaturation,@xcite a subject of considerable current theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "the thermodynamic framework of the solubility is well established @xcite .",
    "the excess gibbs free energy @xmath1 of dissolving one mole of solute in @xmath2 moles of solvent is defined as the difference between the gibbs free energies of the solution and the sum of the gibbs free energies of the pure solvent and the pure solute at constant pressure @xmath3 and temperature @xmath0 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the differences between the molar enthalpy molar potential energy , molar volume and molar entropy of the solution and pure substances .",
    "the main contribution to the entropic term @xmath9 , is the entropy of mixing @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mole fraction of solute , @xmath12 is the universal gas constant , @xmath13 is the avogadro number and @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the term t@xmath15 dominates at high temperatures and thus favors mixing , but at low temperatures it becomes insignificant .",
    "however , the entropic term is not responsible for the solubility minimum as function of temperature .",
    "according to le chatelier s principle , if solvation is exothermic ( @xmath16 ) the solubility increases upon cooling at constant pressure .",
    "conversely , if @xmath17 , the solubility increases upon heating .",
    "thus the condition @xmath18 corresponds to the solubility extreme . since @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , the maximum in @xmath21 corresponds to the point at which @xmath18 , changing its sign from positive to negative upon cooling .",
    "these thermodynamic arguments were applied by paschek et al .",
    ", @xcite who showed that for the solution of lennard - jones polymer - chains in tip5p water the enthalpic term @xmath22 becomes increasingly negative at low temperatures and thus stabilizes the solution .",
    "the phenomenon of a solubility minimum has been discussed in terms of hydrogen bond restructuring in water at low temperature , which leads to the formation of water cages around small nonpolar molecules , monomers , or protein residues @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath23 term becomes negative at low temperatures since , because the distances between water molecules increases upon cooling , there is more space for small solutes to penetrate the solvent .",
    "the @xmath6 term may also become negative , because introducing small nonpolar solutes inside water separates water molecules further apart and thus helps water molecules to form stronger hydrogen bonds . without nonpolar particles ,",
    "5-coordinated molecules with weaker hydrogen bonds would be observed .    in this paper , we attempt to elucidate the connection of the increase of solubility upon cooling with the anomalous thermodynamic properties of pure water .",
    "recently it was shown that the spherically - symmetric jagla ramp potential ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla ] ) explains anomalous _ thermodynamic _ and _ dynamic _ properties of water in terms of the presence of two length scales : a `` hard core , '' corresponding to the first rigid tetrahedral shell of the nearest neighbors in water , and a wider `` soft core , '' corresponding to the second ( more flexible ) shell of neighbors @xcite .",
    "we will see that the jagla potential is capable of reproducing the _ solubility _ properties of water , and based on this result we will propose a mechanism for the solubility increase of nonpolar compounds in water on cooling",
    ".    using discrete molecular dynamic ( dmd ) simulations described in section ii , we show in section iii that the solubility of hard sphere solutes in the jagla solvent has a characteristic minimum as a function of temperature similar to the minimum of the solubility of small nonpolar compounds in water .",
    "hard spheres can be used to describe nonpolar compounds , since the van der waals interactions among nonpolar compounds are an order of magnitude weaker than the hydrogen bond interactions between water molecules and thus can be neglected in assessing the effect largely caused by the restructuring of hydrogen bonds . in section",
    "iv we relate the solubility increase to the behavior of the excess thermodynamic functions . in section",
    "v , we study the behavior of the beads - on - a - string homopolymer composed of hard sphere monomers immersed in the same jagla solvent . we show that the radius of gyration @xmath24 of the polymer has a sharp minimum as a function of temperature at low constant pressures , indicating that the system may display a lcst at low pressure . at higher pressure , the @xmath24 minimum becomes less pronounced , indicating the increase of solubility at intermediate temperatures and decrease of solubility at low temperatures .",
    "the interaction potential of the jagla solvent particles @xmath25 is characterized by five parameters : the hard core diameter @xmath26 , the soft core diameter @xmath27 , the range of attractive interactions @xmath28 , the depth of the attractive ramp @xmath29 , and the height of repulsive ramp @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla ] ) @xcite , of which three are independent : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the most important of these parameters is the ratio of the soft core and hard core diameters , @xmath31 , which must be selected close to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the positions of the first and the second peaks of the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function for water .",
    "following @xcite we select @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "this choice of parameters produces a phase diagram which qualitatively resembles the water phase diagram with two stable critical points and a wide region of density anomaly bounded by the locus of the temperature of maximum density @xmath40 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla](b ) ] .",
    "the slope of the coexistence line between the high density liquid ( hdl ) and the low density liquid ( ldl ) in this model is positive  unlike water , for which this slope is negative . in order to use the dmd algorithm @xcite",
    ", we replace the repulsive and attractive ramps with 40 and 8 equal steps , respectively , as described in @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla ] ) .",
    "we measure length in units of @xmath26 , time in units of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the particle mass , density in units of @xmath43 , pressure in units of @xmath44 , and temperature in units of @xmath45 .",
    "this realization of the jagla model displays a liquid - gas critical point at @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xmath48 , and a liquid - liquid critical point at @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "we model solute particles by hard spheres of diameter @xmath52 , which we select to be equal to the hard core diameter of the jagla solvent @xmath53 .",
    "the dependence of the solubility on @xmath52 is an important question and will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we first study the effect of pressure and temperature on the solubility of hard - sphere solutes in the jagla solvent . in order to do this ,",
    "we create a system of n=1400 jagla particles and 2800 hard spheres in a box @xmath54 with periodic boundaries .",
    "we fix @xmath55 , and vary @xmath56 [ fig .  [ fig : jagla](c ) ] to maintain constant pressure and temperature using berendsen thermostat and barostat . for @xmath57 , the mixture of jagla particles and hard spheres segregates and the jagla particles form a slab of liquid crossing the system perpendicular to the @xmath58-axis . for each pressure and temperature , we equilibrate the system for 500 time units and measure the mole fraction of hard spheres in the narrow slabs perpendicular to the @xmath58 axis for another 500 time units . we find that this equilibration time is sufficient if the temperature for the two successive simulations is changed by less then 10% .",
    "in each slab we count the numbers @xmath59 of jagla solvent particles and @xmath60 of hard sphere solute particles .",
    "we define a slab as a liquid slab if @xmath61 and as a vapor slab if @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a temperature and pressure dependent threshold , such that the liquid and vapor slabs form two continuous regions covering the entire system with the exception of a few slabs representing the boundary . to minimize the boundary effects ,",
    "we exclude from the liquid phase the slabs whose distance to the closest vapor slab is less than @xmath64 .",
    "the analogous criterion is applied to determine the vapor phase . finally , we find the mole fraction @xmath65 of hard spheres in the liquid and vapor phases and compute the henry constant @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the average mole fractions of hard spheres in the vapor and liquid phases respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : henry](a ) shows the inverse henry constant as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the behavior of the solubility follows the behavior of the inverse henry constant [ fig .",
    "[ fig : henry](b ) ] , since for @xmath72 the partial vapor pressure of solvent is very low and , therefore , @xmath73 .",
    "hence the solubility @xmath74 is inversely proportional to the henry constant and thus the solubility minimum as function of temperature practically coincides with the maximum of @xmath75 .",
    "one can see that henry s law @xmath76 is approximately correct since @xmath77 increases by less than 30% when the pressure increases by 200% from 0.1 to 0.3 .",
    "the most interesting feature of the behavior of the henry constant is that it has a maximum as function of temperature at @xmath78 , indicating that the solubility of hard sphere solutes in a jagla solvent has a minimum at this temperature and increases upon cooling below @xmath79 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the behavior of the henry constant of alkanes ( c@xmath80h@xmath81 ) in water , which increases upon cooling below t=@xmath82k @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath79 is much larger than the temperature of maximum density , @xmath83k , for both water and for the jagla model ( for which @xmath84 at @xmath69 ) @xcite .",
    "to relate the behavior of the henry constant to thermodynamic state functions , we must express the henry constant in terms of @xmath1 . at low solute mole fraction @xmath85 in the liquid phase , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the number of moles of solvent and solute respectively",
    ", the gibbs potential @xmath88 of the solution can be approximated by the first two terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath88 around @xmath89 @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the molar gibbs potential of pure liquid and @xmath92 is the chemical potential of solute in liquid . at low pressures",
    ", the analogous approximation can be made for the vapor phase @xmath93 minimization of the sum of the gibbs potentials of the two phases with respect to @xmath87 at constant @xmath94 gives the equilibrium condition : @xmath95 the chemical potential of solute in vapor is approximately equal to the molar gibbs potential of the pure solute .",
    "thus @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath1 is given by eq .  (",

    "thus the henry constant has a maximum at the same temperature as @xmath103 .",

    "( [ eq:6x ] ) , maximal henry constant .",
    "we find @xmath122 and @xmath123 thus only weakly depending on @xmath105 and @xmath3 . for both @xmath3 values ,",
    "@xmath7 becomes negative as the temperature drops below the liquid - gas critical temperature @xmath124 .",
    "since @xmath6 decreases with decreasing temperature in this region , @xmath5 becomes negative at sufficiently low @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the fact that the solute particles enter relatively large free spaces between the solvent particles which are kept apart not by the hard core but rather by the repulsive ramps , thus creating large negative @xmath7 [ figs .",
    "[ fig : jagla](b ) and [ fig : jagla](c ) ] .",
    "however at high temperatures , the entropic contribution to the free energy is important and the solvent particles in the solute are spread further apart than in the pure sovent .",
    "thus the number of solute particles in the attractive range of the jagla potential is reduced , leading to @xmath125 .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the potential energy of the solution approaches its ground state , which is the same as that of the pure solvent , because the solute particles are small enough to remain in the area unavailable for the solvent particles at low temperatures due to their repulsive ramp interactions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : jagla](b ) ] .",
    "at sufficiently low @xmath0 , the excess enthalpy @xmath5 of the solution becomes negative , indicating the increase of solubility upon further cooling .",
    "close to @xmath40 , the behavior at low and high pressure becomes different . for @xmath126 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag](b ) ] , the pure solvent starts to expand upon cooling , thus increasing the free space for the solute particles , and further increasing the solubility .",
    "this is clearly indicated by the sharp decrease in @xmath7 . for @xmath127 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag](a ) ] , there is no @xmath40 and the pure solvent collapses upon crossing the widom line @xcite into an hdl - like liquid on the lower side of the widom line . thus @xmath7 starts to increase upon cooling , and eventually @xmath7 becomes positive . on the other hand",
    "@xmath6 keeps decreasing on decreasing @xmath0 and becomes negative because the solute particles prevent the solvent particles from `` climbing the repulsive ramps '' upon compression and therefore help them remain near the minimum of the pair potential .    to test this explanation directly ,",
    "we compute for @xmath128 and @xmath129 the solvent - solvent density correlation function , @xmath130 , in the pure solvent and in the solution with solute mole fraction @xmath131 , [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gr](a ) ] .",
    "we see that the first peak in @xmath130 , corresponding to the solvent particles staying at the hard core distance in the pure solvent , significantly decreases in the solution .",
    "in contrast , the second peak , corresponding to the solvent particles staying at the soft core distance , increases . the behavior of the cross - correlation function @xmath132 of the solute and solvent [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gr](c ) ] indicates that indeed the solute particles prefer to remain very close to the solvent particles in the region unavailable for solvent particles due to their repulsive ramp interactions .",
    "the behavior of the solute - solute correlation function @xmath133 indicates a small decrease in the first peak and an increase in the second peak upon cooling [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gr](d ) ] , corresponding to the increase of solubility . overall , the structure of the solution is more pronounced than in the pure solvent case , indicated by negative @xmath134 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : deltag](b ) ] .",
    "this behavior of the jagla solvent with hard sphere solutes is analogous to the behavior of water molecules in the presence of nonpolar compounds .",
    "the hard core of the jagla model corresponds to the rigid tetrahedron ( first shell ) of water molecules linked by hydrogen bonds to a central molecule .",
    "a particle at the hard core distance in the jagla model corresponds to an extra ( fifth ) water molecule entering the first shell .",
    "this molecule may cause the formation of a bifurcated hydrogen bond @xcite of higher potential energy than the normal hydrogen bond .",
    "the nonpolar solute molecules in water remain close to the first shell of water molecules , and thus prevent extra water molecules entering into the first shell and forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds .",
    "thus in water , solute particles help stabilize hydrogen bonds .",
    "the second shell of water becomes more structured by forming cages around the solute molecules without breaking any hydrogen bonds .    for @xmath135 ,",
    "the @xmath130 for pure solvent and solution are practically indistinguishable ( not shown ) , with only slight decrease of the overall number of solvent particles within the attractive range in the solution compared to the pure solvent , corresponding to small @xmath125 .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath132 and @xmath133 at low pressures ( not shown ) are practically the same as at high pressures .",
    "this means that for low pressures the increase of the solubility upon cooling is mainly because of the decrease of @xmath7 due to the small and even negative thermal expansion coefficient of the pure solvent .",
    "we expect that the relative strength of the two contributions , energetic and volumetric , to @xmath5 strongly depends on the size of the solute particles . accordingly , in water one might expect both mechanisms to be present , depending on @xmath3 , and on the nature of the solute .    to check the validity of our calculations of the henry constant @xmath136 and the thermodynamic excess quantities , we compare @xmath137 obtained directly by measuring the mole fraction of hard spheres in the slabs of sec .",
    "iii with @xmath137 computed using eq .",
    "( [ eq:6x ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : henry ] shows that although the individual contributions of different terms to @xmath1 behave in a complex way , the resulting behavior of the henry constant is in good agreement with the direct simulations near the solubility minimum .",
    "note the failure of thermodynamic predictions at high and low temperatures .",
    "the dramatic solubility drop predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq:6x ] ) at @xmath128 is because at fixed mole fraction , the amount of solute particles become insufficient to prevent the solute from collapse , and eventually @xmath6 also starts to increase upon cooling making @xmath138 at low temperatures .",
    "this predicted decrease of the solubility upon cooling is not observed in the direct simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : henry ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the thermodynamic predictions and actual behavior of the henry constant is due to the fact that at low temperatures the mole fraction @xmath139 is so high , that the linear taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) is no longer valid .",
    "thus , in reality , there are still enough solute particles to prevent the solution from collapsing into an hdl - like liquid . in the next section , concerning polymer solution , we observe the decrease of solvent quality upon cooling at @xmath140 because the polymer monomers do not have sufficient local mole fraction to keep the solution from collapse .",
    "in order to relate the maximum of solubility of nonpolar compounds to the polymer lcst and protein denaturation , we next study the behavior of a polymer composed of @xmath141 monomers modeled by hard spheres of diameter @xmath53 .",
    "we model covalent bonds by linking the hard spheres with the potential @xmath142 where the minimal extent of the bond is @xmath143 and the maximal extent is @xmath144 .",
    "we simulate for @xmath145 time units the trajectory of the polymer at constant @xmath0 and @xmath3 in a cubic box containing @xmath146 jagla solvent particles with periodic boundaries .",
    "we calculate the polymer radius of gyration @xmath147 , where @xmath148 at equidistant times @xmath149 , where @xmath150 , and we calculate the rms radius of gyration @xmath24 , where @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "figure [ rg ] shows the behavior of the radius of gyration of a polymer as a function of temperature for six values of pressure .",
    "also shown for the @xmath153 case is the inverse henry constant .",
    "one can see that for small pressures , @xmath24 reaches a deep minimum at @xmath154 , which occurs above the maximum of the henry constant @xmath155 . as pressure increases , the minimum becomes less pronounced and @xmath156 shifts to higher temperatures and eventually , at @xmath157 , almost disappears . according to the de  gennes - flory - huggins theory @xcite ,",
    "the radius of gyration is a function of polymer length and the solvent quality @xmath158 : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the flory exponent for @xmath24 .",
    "values of @xmath163 correspond to a `` poor '' solvent , in which the polymer chain is collapsed and @xmath164 .",
    "values of @xmath165 correspond to a `` good '' solvent where the polymer swells and @xmath166 .",
    "the value @xmath167 corresponds to the `` theta condition '' with @xmath168 .",
    "thus for a polymer of a given length , the radius of gyration monotonically increases with solvent quality and can be used to calculate lines of the equal solvent quality in the @xmath169 plane .",
    "we tested numerically that near the minimum of @xmath24 for @xmath170 , @xmath171 , so the solvent quality is poor . for @xmath172 ,",
    "@xmath24 is comparable with @xmath173 in a vacuum , and hence the solvent quality is good .",
    "thus the theta condition corresponds to some temperature between @xmath129 and the value of @xmath0 at which @xmath24 has a minimum .",
    "accordingly , the lcst which differs from the theta point by a term of the order of @xmath174 @xcite is also located in this region .",
    "assuming that @xmath175 for @xmath176 corresponds to the theta point , we construct a region in the @xmath169 plane of approximate location of the lcst which merges with the upper critical solution temperature ( ucst ) at @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( fig .",
    "[ rg35 ] ) .",
    "the region of the @xmath169 plane below this line corresponds to the poor solvent in which sufficiently long polymer chains segregate from the sufficiently concentrated solution .",
    "this region lies below @xmath179 and significantly above the @xmath40 line in the @xmath169 plane . on the high temperature side , the region where",
    "@xmath180 is bounded by the liquid - gas critical point .",
    "since the driving force of the folding of globular proteins is the formation of the hydrophobic core , one can imagine that the regions in the @xmath169 plane in which the various proteins can fold into their native states must have similar shapes .",
    "our work suggests a physical mechanism for the increase of solubility of nonpolar solvents upon cooling ( fig .  [",
    "fig : henry ] ) connecting the cold denaturation of a polymer to the lcst .",
    "these phenomena are related to thermodynamic anomalies of pure water because both thermodynamic and solubility properties are reproduced in the simple jagla solvent model .",
    "both of these are caused by the existence of two repulsive scales in the effective model potential , the hard core corresponding to the first tetrahedral shell of water molecules and the soft core corresponding to the second shell of water molecules .",
    "however , the temperature range in which cold denaturation and the solubility minimum occur does not directly coincide with the regions of other water anomalies , which are generally placed at lower temperatures .",
    "interestingly , the region of poor solvent , corresponding to the sharp minimum in @xmath24 lies below the critical pressure of the second critical point . above this pressure , the behavior of the solvent quality changes , being almost constant in the wide range of temperatures much above @xmath181 , but dramatically decreasing as we approach @xmath181 , indicating that the hdl in the jagla model is a poor solvent , while the ldl is a good solvent .",
    "this behavior is in accord with the thermodynamic studies of section iv where a sharp increase in @xmath1 upon cooling near the widom line is found .",
    "the physical reason for this is that ldl in the jagla model has a larger free volume for the hard spheres to enter and is also less ordered than hdl , so entering of the hard spheres does not destroy this order .",
    "whether this situation for water is the same as or the opposite is not clear , since ldl in water , although having larger volume , is more ordered than hdl .",
