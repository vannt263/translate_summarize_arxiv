    "multiply imaged quasars are among the most promising objects for measuring distances and hence cosmological parameters ( refsdal 1964 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ) .",
    "that promise is finally starting to be realized after time delays have been measured in several systems in recent years ( e.g. , schechter et al .",
    "1997 ; kundi et al .",
    "1997c ; hjorth et al .",
    "contrary to local estimates of the hubble parameter , multiply imaged quasars with time delays can be used to measure the hubble parameter on a _ cosmological _ scale and hence are insensitive to local bulk flows .    until recently ,",
    "simple mass distributions have been used to model multiply imaged qsos .",
    "however , the rapid development of observing techniques , and the availability of powerful observatories like the _ hubble space telescope _ and the 810 m class telescopes have shown that most of the image configurations are more complex than allowed by simple models . as an example , the famous double qso  0957 + 561 , first thought to be produced by a single galaxy , is now known to be a complex system involving a massive lens plus one or more galaxy clusters ( bernstein & fisher 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "in parallel to the surge in observational efforts , the modeling of galaxies and their surroundings has greatly improved and is starting to provide very important insights into the distribution of dark matter in galaxies ( e.g.  hjorth & kneib 2000 ; maller et al .",
    "2000 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a major uncertainty in the mass models comes from the surroundings of the lens , in the form of `` external shear '' , e.g. , due to either nearby galaxies , a galaxy group or a cluster close to the line of sight to the qso ( keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 , kundic et al .",
    "it is important to underline that a reliable mass model requires not only @xmath4 , the gravitational external shear , but also the external surface mass density @xmath5 , producing the measured external shear .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the mass distribution in the vicinity of the lensed quasar is _ mandatory _ in putting stringent constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the quadruple lens system rx  j0911 + 05 , is potentially one of the most valuable systems for cosmological studies .",
    "it was identified by bade et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as a multiply imaged radio quiet qso at @xmath6 , selected as an agn candidate from the rosat all - sky survey . in high - resolution not and ntt images ( burud et al .",
    "1998 ) , rx  j0911 + 05 was soon found to consist of four qso components and an elongated lensing galaxy , confirmed by subsequent _",
    "hst _ imaging .",
    "regular monitoring of rx  j0911 + 05 with the nordic optical telescope is expected to give a time - delay to about 10 percent ( hjorth et al .",
    "2000 ) moreover , recently , the redshift of the main lens was measured at @xmath7 with the keck telescope ( falco , davis & stern , 1999 , private communication ) . the unusual image configuration of rx  j0911",
    "+ 05 requires a large external shear ( @xmath8 ) to be included in the lensing potential in order to reproduce the complex geometry observed in rx  j0911 + 05 .",
    "the probable source of this shear is a galaxy cluster located about 38 from rx  j0911 + 05 as suggested by burud et al .",
    "such a cluster may contribute to the x - ray emission observed by rosat .",
    "the color of the presumed cluster galaxies indicates a redshift in the range of 0.60.8 , consistent with the determined spectroscopic redshift of the main lens galaxy .    in this letter we present the results of spectroscopic observations of rx j0911 + 05 conducted at the keck observatory using the lris instrument .",
    "section 2 summarizes the photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "section 3 presents the constraints on the mass model of the high - redshift cluster of galaxies detected near the quadruple lens",
    ". a discussion of the results is presented in section 4 . throughout this paper",
    "we use a hubble parameter @xmath9 km  @xmath10  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which gives a physical scale of @xmath13 kpc arcsec@xmath2 at the cluster redshift ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we observed rx  j0911 + 05 during the december 78 , 1999 and march 67 , 2000 nights with the lris instrument ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) mounted on keck ii .",
    "imaging was done in b , r and i and calibrated using photometric standards pg2213 - 006 and other stars in the sa92 field ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observation were conducted with the 400/8500 grating blazed at 7200    which gives a dispersion of 1.84   / pixel . standard _",
    "figaro _ and _ iraf _ pipeline reduction packages where used to reduce the photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the journal of these observations is given in table [ tab : journal ] . a color image made of the b , r and i images",
    "is presented in figure [ fig : color ] .",
    "we exposed 2 mos masks , the first mask had 24 slitlets , and the second 30 slitlets .",
    "object selection was limited in magnitude to @xmath14 and generally followed the color selection of burud et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in the first mask ,",
    "a total of 25 objects were observed ( there were two objects in one slitlet ) ; 3 stars and 2 bright galaxies were used to allow a correct alignment of the mask on the objects .",
    "similarly for the second mask , we targeted 30 galaxies , and used 3 stars for the mask alignment .",
    "redshifts were estimated independently by jpk and jgc , by simple line fitting techniques , as well as using the cross - correlation package @xmath15 in @xmath16 ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "redshift identifications are displayed on figure [ fig : color ] .",
    "table [ tab : redshift ] summarizes the photometry and the redshift of the cluster members .",
    "figure [ fig : zhist ] shows the redshift histogram of the entire sample and the cluster sample .",
    "the majority of the cluster member spectra are typical of an old stellar population .",
    "only 3 out of 23 spectra show a strong [ ] emission line ( one of them being an agn ) , and 4 others show a weak [ ] line .",
    "although our target selection was clearly biased to have a large number of early type galaxies , it clearly shows that these galaxies belong to an evolved cluster . note that the small group of apparently redder objects detected some 10 sw from the lens ( burud et al .",
    "1998 ) is found at the same redshift as the cluster .",
    "including the redshift of the lensing galaxy ( falco , davis & stern   1999 , private communication ) we have redshift measurements of 24 cluster members with a mean redshift @xmath17 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the 24 galaxies is @xmath18  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "if one keeps only the 14 high quality spectra , we estimate the mean redshift of @xmath19 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath20  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the two estimates are in good agreement , so we will retain the first one in the following discussion .",
    "we used the biweight estimator to measure the cluster redshift and its dispersion .",
    "the errors were estimated by using the bootstrap algorithm for the mean redshift and the jacknife algorithm for the velocity dispersion ( beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "we computed the harmonic radius @xmath21 ( e.g. , nolthenius & white 1987 ) from our spectroscopic cluster members as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular distance between galaxies @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the number of cluster members , and @xmath27 is the angular diameter distance at the mean cluster redshift @xmath28 .",
    "the cluster virial mass can then be estimated as @xmath29 we found an harmonic radius of @xmath30 kpc and a mass @xmath31 m@xmath32 .",
    "assuming that the cluster follows the @xmath33@xmath34 relation ( _ e.g. _ girardi et al .",
    "1996 ) , we derive an x - ray temperature of @xmath35 kev .",
    "we have thus identified a new massive cluster at high redshift .",
    "this cluster is not as massive as the cluster ms1054@xmath3603 ( tran et al .",
    "1998 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2000 ) but is similar to ms1137.5 + 6625 ( @xmath37  km  @xmath10 as measured by donahue et al .",
    "2000 ) . assuming a singular isothermal sphere centered on the brightest galaxy of the cluster",
    ", the computed velocity dispersion translates into a gravitational shear of @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 at the location of the multiple quasar .",
    "this quick estimate of the external shear is close to the value found in the modeling of the lens plus an external shear ( burud et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "having identified the cluster redshift and derived an estimate of the galaxy velocity dispersion , we can go a step further and try to model the system modeling mass distribution of the cluster and its galaxies in a similar way as for abell 2218 ( kneib et al .",
    "the cluster galaxies are modeled as truncated isothermal spheres , with a velocity dispersion and truncation radius scaled with the galaxy luminosity .",
    "the center position of the cluster is set to the position of the brightest galaxy and the velocity dispersion as given by our spectroscopic survey .",
    "the constraints are the quasar positions and flux ratios ( although we only give a relatively small weight to the flux ratio constraints due to possible microlensing ( burud et al .  1998 ) , the position , orientation , and ellipticity of the main lens system as measured on the hst / nicmos-2 image ( pi : falco ) .",
    "the fiducial best - fitting model found is displayed in figure [ fig : model ] , where we show the surface mass density of the model .",
    "note that the lens model favors an elongated mass distribution of the cluster aligned with the cluster light distribution .",
    "the time delay expected between images @xmath42 and @xmath43 is strongly dependent on the exact morphology and mass distribution of the cluster ; we found that @xmath44 .",
    "the lower time - delay value corresponds to a more massive cluster",
    ". clearly it would be very important to further constrain the mass distribution of the cluster before trying to get a constraint on the hubble parameter .",
    "we have identified a massive high - redshift cluster of galaxies at @xmath45 responsible for the very large external shear ( @xmath46 ) , affecting the lens potential of the quadrupole quasar rx  j0911 + 05 .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion based on 24 members leads to a velocity dispersion of @xmath47  km  @xmath10 . using these results we present a new mass model for this lens which includes the contribution of a cluster and the cluster galaxies in a similar way as kneib et al .",
    "the predicted time delay is estimated to be @xmath44 , depending on the exact mass distribution of the cluster .",
    "further observations using the wfpc2 on board hst will allow us to directly measure the predicted cluster weak shear from the distortions of faint background galaxies ; x - ray observations conducted with the new x - ray satellites ( _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ ) will permit to study the gas properties of this distant cluster in detail .",
    "such complementary data will be essential in producing a reliable mass model of the system which , in combination with the foreseen measurement of the time delay , may provide the best constrained mass model for a multiple qso , hence leading to an accurate cosmological estimate of the hubble parameter .",
    "this serendipitous cluster discovery is very interesting because it demonstrates that multiple quasars with large separation are efficient in revealing high - redshift collapsed structure .",
    "indeed , there is a growing number of such multiple quasars where a cluster or group as been detected ( e.g. , q0957 : bernstein & fischer 1999 ; the cloverleaf : kneib et al .  1998a , 1998b , mg2016 + 116 hattori et al .",

    "soucail et al .",
    "2000 , pg1115 + 080 : schechter et al .",
    "1997 , kundic et al .",
    "therefore , multiple qso system , constitute a useful way to discover and study high - redshift groups and clusters along their line of sight .",
    "part of the work presented is based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained from the data archive at the space telescope science institute .",
    "stsci is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . under nasa contract",
    "nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation , and particularly its late president , howard keck , for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory . + it is a pleasure to acknowledge the efficient and friendly support of the keck observatory staff .",
    "we also acknowledge useful discussions with c. kochanek , f. courbin , and i. burud .",
