    "existence and uniqueness of the solution for - in a smooth domain were proved by chen et al .",
    "@xcite , where equivalence of - to the ginzburg ",
    "landau equations under the temporal gauge was proved .",
    "various numerical methods for solving the tdgl were reviewed in @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the many numerical approximation schemes , numerical analysis of the model seems very limited so far .",
    "error analysis of a galerkin finite element method ( fem ) with an implicit backward euler time - stepping scheme was presented in @xcite , where optimal - order convergence rate of the numerical solution was proved for sufficiently regular solution . a linearized crank  nicolson scheme was proposed in @xcite for a regularized tdgl under the temporal gauge without error analysis .",
    "an alternating crank  nicolson scheme was proposed in @xcite and error estimates were presented for a regularized tdgl under the grid - ratio restriction @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the time - step size and spatial mesh size . although convergence of the numerical solutions has been proved in @xcite in smooth domains , these error estimates may not hold in a domain with corners , where the regularity of the solution may not satisfy the conditions required in the analysis .",
    "it has been reported in @xcite that the numerical solution of the magnetic potential by the fem often exhibits undesired singularities around a corner . to resolve this problem ,",
    "a mixed fem was proposed in @xcite to approximate the triple @xmath16 , @xmath17 in a finite element subspace of @xmath18 , which requires less regularity of @xmath19 intuitively , and error estimates of the finite element solution were presented under the assumption that @xmath19 is in @xmath20 .",
    "recently , an optimal - order error estimate of the fem with a linearized crank  nicolson scheme was presented in @xcite without restriction on the grid ratio , but the analysis requires stronger regularity of the solution and the domain . on one hand , existing theoretical and numerical analysis of the model all require the magnetic potential to be in @xmath21 . in a domain with reentrant corners , however , the magnetic potential may not be in @xmath21 and well - posedness of the tdgl remains open . on the other hand , numerical approximations of the tdgl in domains with reentrant corners",

    "we shall prove that the system - is well - posed , with @xmath22 for some @xmath23 which depends on the interior angles of the reentrant corners .",
    "as shown in the numerical examples , with such low - regularity , the fem may give an incorrect solution for the magnetic potential @xmath19 , which further pollutes the numerical solution of @xmath5 due to the coupling of equations .",
