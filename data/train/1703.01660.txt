    "the underlined coefficient is closest to the bound @xmath62 in proposition [ prop : bigintegers ] .    to construct our list of @xmath18 representatives",
    ", we relied on the following three methodologies .",
    "first , we employed geometric constructions that are described in the literature on topology of real algebraic curves .",
    "such constructions are found in many of the articles , from harnack and hilbert to gudkov and viro . for larger numbers of ovals",
    ", these constructions led to polynomials whose integer coefficients were too big . in those cases , we needed to improve the coefficients .",
    "this was done using techniques described in section 4 .",
    "a third approach is to start with especially nice , but possibly singular , ternary sextics seen in the literature .",
    "the last method is exemplified by the _",
    "robinson curve_. this is the symmetric sextic @xmath63 where @xmath64 is any point in @xmath4 . for @xmath65 ,",
    "this degree six curve is smooth and its real locus consists of ten non - nested ovals .",
    "this is a sextic we like , and we therefore included @xmath66 in the list above as our representative for the type 10 nd .",
    "the discriminant divides the robinson net ( [ eq : robinson ] ) into @xmath67 components that realize four topological types .",
    "the green region represents smooth sextics with @xmath68 non - nested ovals.,height=253 ]    we named this net of sextics after r.m .",
    "robinson , who showed in 1973 that the special sextic @xmath69 is non - negative but is not a sum of squares .",
    "the reason is geometric : its real locus consists of @xmath70 isolated singular points in @xmath4 , given by the columns of the matrix @xmath71 to understand how the topology of @xmath72 varies with @xmath73 , we examine the complement of the discriminant in @xmath4 .",
    "this is the following reducible polynomial of degree  @xmath16 : @xmath74 the complement of the discriminant in @xmath4 has 15 connected components .",
    "these realize the following topological types of smooth sextics : 10 , 4 , 3 and 0 .",
    "these types are found in 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 connected components respectively .",
    "the most interesting part of the partition is shown in figure [ fig : zwei ] .",
    "the green region is the component corresponding to curves with 10 ovals .",
    "smooth curves in the orange , red and blue region have 0 , 3 and 4 ovals respectively .",
    "the robinson net serves as a cartoon for the geometric object studied in this paper : the partition of a @xmath75-dimensional real projective space into @xmath18 connected components by an irreducible hypersurface of degree @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : zwei ] is a two - dimensional slice of that partition .",
    "deriving the topology of a real plane curve from its equation is a well - studied problem in computational geometry .",
    "the main idea is to ascertain the topology of plane curves by constructing isotopic graphs whose nodes are the critical points ( singular and extreme ) .",
    "authors who studied this problem include jinsan cheng , sylvain lazard , luis pearanda , marc pouget , fabrice rouillier , elias tsigaridas , laureano gonzlez - vega , ioana necula , mhammed el kahoui , hoon hong , raimund seidel , and nicola wolpert .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the algorithm in @xcite is called isotop .",
    "it is implemented in maple using certain packages written in c. we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 , page 28 ) for comparisons between isotop and top , as well as with insulate , alcix @xcite , and cad2d @xcite .",
    "the latter two are implemented in c++ .",
    "after first experiments with these packages , we came to the conclusion that it is preferable for us to have our own specialized implementation for curves of degree six in @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , all of the mentioned packages compute the topology of the curve in the affine chart @xmath76 .",
    "it was not obvious how to extract the topological type of the curve in the projective plane from the output with a reasonable amount of coding effort .",
    "developers and users of the packages above may wish to experiment with our representatives for @xmath68 and @xmath20 ovals .",
    "we wrote a program in mathematica called sexticclassifier .",
    "it relies heavily on the built - in quantifier elimination techniques of mathematica",
    ". the code can be obtained from our supplementary materials website ( [ eq : url ] ) .",
    "the input to sexticclassifier is a ternary sextic with integer coefficients , @xmath77_6 $ ] .",
    "the code checks whether @xmath78 defines a non - singular curve in @xmath79 .",
    "if not , then the output is `` singular '' . otherwise , our program identifies which of the @xmath0 topological types the real curve @xmath80 belongs to",
    "we next explain how it works .",
    "first we compute a _ cylindrical algebraic decomposition _ ( cad ; see e.g.  @xcite ) of the curve @xmath80 in the affine chart @xmath81 . from this",
    "we build a graph whose nodes are the critical points of the projection along the @xmath82-axis .",
    "two nodes are connected by an edge if an arc of the curve connects the corresponding points .",
    "we also keep track of the relative positions of these arcs . in order to get the correct topology in @xmath4 , we add further edges corresponding to arcs crossing the line at infinity .",
    "we end up with a graph whose connected components are in one - to - one correspondence with the connected components of the curve .",
    "finally , for each pair of connected components of the graph , we have to check whether one of the corresponding ovals lies inside one of the other .",
    "this is done by first deciding whether the center of projection lies inside the ovals or not . knowing this , detecting a nesting of two ovals only amounts to looking at the parity of the number of branches of one oval lying above the other oval .",
    "the program terminates correctly in less than four seconds for all sextics in section 2 .",
    "if the coefficients are between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then it takes less than one second .",
    "[ ex : emptyavoidancelocus ] here is an instance that will be of interest in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the sextic @xmath85 after checking that the complex curve @xmath86 is smooth , our code reveals that the real curve @xmath80 consists of three separate non - nested ovals .",
    "thus , the input to sexticclassifier is the polynomial @xmath78 and the output is the label 3 . in particular",
    ", @xmath80 is non - dividing .    the sextic @xmath78 has the property that every real line in @xmath87 meets @xmath86 in at least one real point .",
    "thus , @xmath80 is not compact in any affine chart of @xmath4 , regardless of which line serves as the line at infinity .",
    "while such non - compact curves may cause difficulties in some of the approaches discussed above , sexticclassifier has been designed to handle them well .",
    "@xmath88    forty - eight of the fifty - six topological types determine whether the curve is dividing or not .",
    "however , the remaining eight were found by nikulin @xcite to split into two rigid isotopy types .",
    "suppose that the output of sexticclassifier is one of the eight labels in  ( [ eq:8areboth ] ) .",
    "at present , we have no easy tool for deciding whether the given @xmath78 is dividing or non - dividing .",
    "that decision requires us to build a model of the riemann surface @xmath86 in order to ascertain whether @xmath89 has one or two connected components .",
    "a method for making that decision was developed and implemented by kalla and klein @xcite , but presently their code is not suitable for curves of genus @xmath68 .",
    "one of our goals for the future is to extend sexticclassifier so that it decides rapidly between ` d ' and ` nd ' when the output is in ( [ eq:8areboth ] ) .    as a first application of sexticclassifier , we computed the empirical distributions of the topological types over the space of ternary sextics .",
    "in other words , we ask : what is the probability that a particular topological type arises when we pick a sextic curve at random ?",
    "of course , the answer will depend on the choice of a probability distribution on the sextics @xmath90 a theoretical study for curves of large degree was carried out recently by lerario and lundberg @xcite , who employed the real fubini - study ensemble and the kostlan distribution .",
    "our experiments below are meant to inform this line of inquiry with some empirical numbers .",
    "the first distribution we consider is @xmath91-invariant .",
    "the @xmath92 coefficients @xmath93 are  chosen independently from a univariate normal distribution , centered at @xmath19 , with variance equal to the multinomial coefficient @xmath94 . according to @xcite , this is the unique @xmath91-invariant probability measure on @xmath42_6 $ ] .",
    "we selected @xmath95 samples , we ran sexticclassifer on these sextics , and we tallied the topological types .",
    "the result is shown in table  [ tab : u3invariant ] .",
    "@xmath96    we see that the empirical distribution is very skewed .",
    "only @xmath36 of the @xmath0 types were observed at all .",
    "only six types had an empirical probability of @xmath97 .",
    "no curve with more than six ovals was observed . in our sample ,",
    "the average number of connected components is approximately @xmath98 .",
    "another numerical invariant of the topological type of a smooth real plane curve introduced in @xcite is the _ energy_.",
    "this nonnegative integer measures the nesting of the ovals . for sextics ,",
    "the maximal energy is @xmath99 and attained by the harnack - type curve @xmath25 .",
    "the average energy of the sextics in the sample above is approximately @xmath100 .",
    "we experimented with several other distributions on @xmath42_6 $ ] , each time drawing 500,000 samples and running sexticclassifier . in the following tables , we report percentages , and we only list topological types with empirical probability at least 0.01% .",
    "@xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    if we naively sample our sextics having uniformly distributed integer coefficients , then the empirical distribution is even more skewed ( table [ tab : uniform ] ) . in table",
    "[ tab : symmetric ] we see the empirical distribution obtained from sampling symmetric sextic polynomials .",
    "we do this by taking linear combinations of the monomial symmetric polynomials with coefficients being uniformly distributed integers between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we see that the distribution now looks rather different from the two distributions considered before .",
    "for example , type 7 appears with probability @xmath107 whereas it did not appear among the @xmath95 samples from the @xmath108-invariant distribution .",
    "the largest variety of types is observed when we sample sextics of the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath6 are symmetric @xmath111-matrices whose entries are uniformly distributed random integers between @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( table [ tab : detrep ] ) .",
    "this is also the only distribution we considered where the type with only one oval is not the most common type .",
    "several types appear that did not show up among the @xmath95 samples in table [ tab : u3invariant ] .",
    "our most skewed distribution was from sampling signed sums ( with the signs chosen uniformly at random ) of ten sixth powers of linear forms whose coefficients are uniformly distributed integers between @xmath112 and @xmath113 . thus here",
    "we are restricting to sextics of real rank @xmath68 , the case considered in @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : rank10 ] reveals that more than @xmath114 of the samples have one oval .",
    "after passing to eleven summands , we observe more curves of type @xmath115 than empty curves .",
    "going to sums of twelve sixth powers of linear forms increases this effect .",
    "our experiments demonstrate that it is extremely rare to observe many ovals when sextic curves are generated at random .",
    "we never encountered a sextic with 8 , 9 , 10 or 11 ovals . only few types occurred in our samples .",
    "this underscores the importance of having the explicit polynomials in @xmath41_6 $ ] that are listed above , to serve as seeds for local sampling .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of representative sextics , such as those listed in section  2 .",
    "we also present a method for sampling from any of the @xmath18 rigid isotopy classes .",
    "small coefficient size is a natural criterion for desirable representatives .",
    "we say that a sextic @xmath78 as in ( [ eq : sextic ] ) is _ optimal _ if its coefficients @xmath93 are integers , its complex curve @xmath86 is smooth , and the largest absolute value @xmath116 is minimal among all such sextics in the same rigid isotopy class .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the fermat sextics @xmath117 are optimal .",
    "one approach to finding optimal sextics is to sample at random from sextics with @xmath118 with @xmath119 very small .",
    "one might also do a brute force search that progressively increases the sum of the absolute values @xmath116 .",
    "such strategies work for some of the types seen with highest frequency in table [ tab : u3invariant ] .",
    "for instance , sampling with @xmath120 yields these four optimal sextics : @xmath121 however , this approach is not useful for constructing the vast majority of types , since these are extremely rare when we sample at random , and they will never appear for small @xmath119 .    for all systematic constructions , it is imperative to work with the _ discriminant _ @xmath11 .",

    "namely , we start with a representative @xmath78 with @xmath146 , like one of the @xmath18 sextics in section  2 .",

    "we now come to the punchline of section 4 , namely , how the polynomials in section  2 were created .",
    "let us begin by mentioning a technique that was challenging to use .",
    "_ viro s patchworking method _",
    "@xcite is a construction for real varieties in the tropical limit .",
    "it is known that all @xmath0 topological types of smooth sextics can be realized by patchworking . in that guise ,",
    "one records the signs of the @xmath92 coefficients @xmath93 and represents their magnitudes by a regular unimodular triangulation of the newton polygon .",
    "transitioning from that representation to actual polynomials in @xmath41_6 $ ] yields integer coefficients @xmath93 whose absolute values are extremely large .",
    "we experimented with some of these sextics , but in the end we abandoned them for all but three types , because symbolic computation became prohibitively slow .",
    "instead , for deriving proposition  [ prop : bigintegers ] , we used that many types , especially the sextics with @xmath190 to @xmath51 ovals , can be found by perturbing the union of three quadrics intersecting transversally .",
    "this process is shown in figure [ fig : construction ] .",
    "some of the types with 8 and 9 components could also be constructed in a similar fashion .",
    "this is reflected in our representatives in section 2 .",
    "a sextic of type @xmath191 is constructed by perturbing the union of three quadrics.,width=453 ]    for most other types , we carried out the classical constructions of harnack and hilbert , as explained by gudkov @xcite .",
    "we start with two quadrics intersecting in four real points , pick eight points on the curves , and perturb the reducible quartic with the product of four lines through these points .",
    "the smooth quartic is intersected with one of the original quadrics and perturbed again to get a smooth sextic .",
    "the different ways in which the original curves and the points on them are selected give the different types .",
    "this method worked for almost all types . for the construction of type ( 51)5 , we tried gudkov s method but found it too complicated to carry out explicitly .",
    "we used @xcite and built a ( 51)5 curve using patchworking on three touching ellipses . note that the largest coefficient in the list in section 2 appears in the types constructed using patchworking and small perturbations thereof .",
    "these constructions enabled us to find representatives for the @xmath0 topological types .",
    "what remained was the issue of distinguishing between dividing and non - dividing curves .",
    "in particular , we needed to find two representatives for the pairs of rigid isotopy types in the eight nikulin cases ( [ eq:8areboth ] ) . to construct those",
    ", we considered dividing curves of degree @xmath192 and @xmath193 , with prescribed orientations , that intersect in @xmath194 real points .",
    "the singular points of the reducible curve can be made smooth in two ways , shown in red in figure [ fig : drei ] . according to fiedler @xcite , if _ all _ intersections are perturbed either using only a or using only b then it is dividing . however ,",
    "if the smoothening is done via a at some crossings and via b at other crossings , then the resulting smooth curve does not divide its riemann surface .",
    "in particular , for the construction of types ( 41)4d and ( 41)4nd we followed @xcite .     using local perturbations to create sextics that are dividing or non - dividing , height=302 ]    at this point , we had @xmath18 representative sextics , and each of them was certified by our code sexticclassifier",
    ". however , the coefficient size for most of them was still unsatisfactory . to improve the representatives , and to arrive at the list that is displayed in section 2 , sylvester s formula for the discriminant ( proposition [ prop : sylvester ] ) proved again to be very helpful .",
    "there are basically two heuristical methods that we used .",
    "one is to shrink the absolute value of each coefficient of a given representative separately as far as possible without crossing the discriminant locus .",
    "the other way is to choose a prime number @xmath151 and vary the polynomial without crossing the discriminant locus so that every coefficient of the resulting polynomial is divisible by @xmath151 . in our experience",
    ", a combination of the two methods yields the best results .",
    "many software packages for plane curves , such as those discussed at the beginning of section  3 , work with affine coordinates .",
    "they often assume that the given curve is compact , so its closure in @xmath4 is disjoint from a distinguished line , namely , the line at infinity .",
    "we saw in example  [ ex : emptyavoidancelocus ] that no such line exists for some sextics .",
    "this motivates the concept of the avoidance locus , to be introduced and studied in this section .",
    "this will lead us naturally to computing dual curves and bitangent lines , and to investigating the reality of these objects .",

    "this shows that @xmath255 and @xmath257 are both contained in the bitangent discriminant .",

    "for any integer @xmath119 between @xmath19 and @xmath3 , there exists a smooth sextic @xmath6 in @xmath4 whose avoidance locus @xmath47 comprises exactly @xmath119 convex connected components .    let @xmath269 be a sextic of type 10nd whose avoidance locus has @xmath3 components , as in example [ ex : scheiderer ] .",

    "indeed , at a point where that number drops by one , exactly three relevant bitangents come together , giving a sextic with a single tritangent in @xmath274 .",

    "certified samples were drawn in the vicinity of each of our current @xmath18 representatives , using the local exploration method that is described after proposition [ prop : sylvester ] .    each row of table [ tab : flexetc ] has five entries : the name of the rigid isotopy type , numbers of real inflection points , numbers of real eigenvectors , numbers of real bitangents , and one real rank .",
    "the numbers are ranges of integers that were observed in our experiments . for instance , for type @xmath285",
    ", we found numbers ranging between @xmath286 and @xmath287 of real bitangents among @xmath2 complex ones . in some cases ,",
    "all samples gave the same number of real solutions .",
    "for instance , all our type @xmath288 sextics had @xmath289 real bitangents .",
    "each entry in table  [ tab : flexetc ] can be regarded as a * conjecture*. for example , we conjecture that every smooth sextic of type @xmath288 has exactly @xmath289 real bitangents . for real inflection points and real eigenvectors we performed exact computations .",
    "that means that we are sure that all numbers listed in the table actually occur .",
    "however , we do not know whether there are more possible numbers",
    ". for bitangents the calculations are more involved and we applied numerical methods .",
    "this means that , for some instances , the number of real solutions might be undercounted .",
    "this can happen when two or more real bitangents lie very close to each other .",
    "the computations for estimating the real rank are even more delicate and were also accomplished numerically .",
    "the second column concerns _ inflection points _ of a smooth sextic @xmath290 .",
    "there are @xmath291 complex inflection points .",
    "they are computed as the solutions of the equations @xmath292 a curve of degree @xmath5 has @xmath249 complex inflection points . a classical result due to",
    "felix klein states that the number of real inflection points is at most @xmath250 .",
    "brugall and lpez de medrano @xcite showed that this upper bound is tight for all degrees @xmath5 .",

    "the column labeled `` flex '' shows the empirical distribution on the @xmath18 rigid isotopy types .",
    "the third and fifth column pertain to the study of tensors in multilinear algebra .",
    "here we identify the space @xmath294_6 $ ] of ternary sextics with the space of symmetric tensors of format @xmath295 .",
    "such a symmetric tensor @xmath78 has @xmath92 distinct entries , and these are the coefficients @xmath93 of the sextic .",
    "a vector @xmath296 is an _ eigenvector _ of @xmath78 if @xmath297 is parallel to the gradient of @xmath78 at @xmath297 .",

    "* theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "the eigenvectors are the critical points of the optimization problem of maximizing @xmath78 on the unit sphere @xmath300 .",
    "since @xmath78 attains a minimum and a maximum on @xmath301 , the number of real eigenvectors is at least @xmath115 .",
    "we note that the upper bound @xmath302 is attained over @xmath126 .",

    "for many rigid isotopy types we found instances that attain the maximal number @xmath303 of real eigenvectors . among them",
    "are the @xmath50 types that have unions of six real lines in general position in their closure .",
    "these types are marked with an asterisk next to the number @xmath303 .",
    "we found these by perturbing each of the four combinatorial types of arrangements of six lines in general position in  @xmath304 .",
    "this search process resulted in @xmath50 of the rigid isotopy types .",
    "a theoretical study of real eigenvectors was undertaken by maccioni in @xcite .",
    "he proved that the number of real eigenvectors of a ternary form is bounded below by @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the number of ovals .",
    "our findings in the third column of table  [ tab : flexetc ] confirm this theorem .",

    "the smallest number of summands needed in such a representation is the _ rank _ of that tensor .",
    "this notion depends on the underlying field .",
    "symmetric tensors of rank @xmath168 are powers of linear forms ( times a constant ) .",
    "hence , the rank @xmath308 of a ternary form @xmath78 of degree @xmath5 is the minimum number of summands in a representation @xmath309 the exact determination of the real rank of a sextic @xmath78 is very difficult . the task is to decide the solvability over @xmath126 of the equations in the unknowns @xmath310 obtained by equating coefficients in ( [ eq : frank ] ) .",
    "this computation is a challenge for both symbolic and numerical methods .",
    "there is no known method that is guaranteed to succeed in practice .",
    "if @xmath78 is a generic sextic in @xmath42_6 $ ] then the complex rank of @xmath78 is @xmath68 , and the real rank of @xmath78 is an integer between @xmath68 and @xmath311 .",

    "* proposition 6.3 ) .",
    "this upper bound is probably not tight .",
    "we experimented with the software tensorlab @xcite .",
    "this is a standard package for tensors , used in the engineering community .",
    "this program furnishes a local optimization method for the following problem : given @xmath78 and @xmath308 , find a sextic @xmath312 of rank @xmath308 that is closest to @xmath78 , with respect to the euclidean distance on the tensor space @xmath313 .",
    "if the output @xmath312 is very close to the input @xmath78 , we can be confident that @xmath78 has real rank @xmath314 .",
    "if @xmath312 is far from @xmath78 , even after many tries with different starting parameters , then we believe that @xmath78 has real rank @xmath315 .",
    "however , tensorlab does not furnish any guarantees .",
    "one needs to rerun the same instance many times to achieve a lower bound on the real rank with high confidence .",
    "the last column of table [ tab : flexetc ] suggests the real rank for each of the @xmath18 sextics listed in section  2 . in each case",
    ", we report our best guess on the lower bound , based on numerical experiments with that instance .",
    "obtaining these numbers with high confidence proved to be difficult .",
    "we had considerable help from anna seigal and emanuele ventura in carrying this out .",
    "most puzzling is the real rank @xmath316 we found for our representative of type @xmath317 , as this seems to contradict ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.3 ) . this is either an error arising in our numerical method , or the sextic lies on some exceptional locus .",
    "clearly , some further study is needed .",
    "we did not yet attempt the same calculation for a larger sample of sextics in each rigid isotopy class . this would be a very interesting future project at the interface of numerics and real algebraic geometry .",
    "the guiding problem is to find the maximal generic real rank among sextics .",
    "to underscore the challenge , here is another open question : the real rank of the monomial @xmath318 is presently unknown .",
    "it is either @xmath20 , @xmath56 or @xmath236 , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 6.7 ) .",
    "we now shift gears and turn to the construction of real k3 surfaces .",
    "two basic models of algebraic k3 surfaces are quartic surfaces in @xmath319 and double - covers of @xmath87 branched at a sextic curve .",
    "thus , each of our ternary sextics in section 2 represents a k3 surface over @xmath320 .",
    "suppose we can write @xmath321 where @xmath322 is a form of degree @xmath323 in @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath324 is a quartic in four variables that realizes the k3 surface with one singular point at @xmath325 . blowing up that singular point gives the k3 surface encoded by @xmath78 .",
    "perturbing the coefficients of @xmath326 gives a smooth quartic surface with similar properties .",
    "the topology of the real surface @xmath327 is determined by the topological type of the real curve @xmath80 and its sign behavior . by perturbing @xmath326 to a polynomial @xmath328",
    ", we can obtain a smooth quartic surface whose real part @xmath329 has the desired topology .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the construction methods in section [ sec : construct ] reveal that many of the @xmath18 types can be realized by adding a positive sextic to the product of a quartic and a conic . for such types , the sextic has the desired form @xmath321 .",
    "the resulting quartic @xmath326 has nice coefficients in @xmath320 .",
    "the real part of a smooth k3 surface is always an orientable surface .",
    "it has at most one connected component with nonpositive euler characteristic  and therefore is determined ( up to homeomorphism ) by its total betti number and its euler characteristic  except when it is the union of two tori .",
    "if it is nonempty , its total betti number ranges between @xmath115 and @xmath252 , and its euler characteristic ranges between @xmath330 and @xmath286 .",

    "further information we refer to silhol s book ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section viii.4 ) .",
    "we conclude by presenting two explicit quartic surfaces that realize the minimal and the maximal euler characteristic .",
    "consider the smooth quartic surface @xmath331 defined by the polynomial @xmath332 its real locus @xmath333 is a connected orientable surface of genus @xmath68 .",
    "the euler characteristic of that surface is @xmath330 .",
    "this is the smallest possible euler characteristic for a real k3 surface .",
