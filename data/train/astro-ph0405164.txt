    "the central parsec of the galaxy contains a cluster of very young stars , including @xmath1 very luminous he  i emission line stars ( krabbe et al .",
    "1995 ; paumard et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as many o and b stars ( eckart , ott , & genzel 1999 ) .",
    "krabbe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that the properties of these stars can be accounted for by a burst of star formation between 3 and 7  myr ago .",
    "the he  i stars appear to be evolved massive ( @xmath2 ) stars with stellar ages of @xmath3  myr ( paumard et al .",
    "krabbe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimate that the number of ob stars with @xmath4 and wolf - rayet stars ( wnl , wcl , & he  i stars ) in the central parsec is @xmath5 .",
    "we define these objects as young massive stars ( ymss ) , and estimate their progenitor masses to be @xmath6 . despite their very young ages , _ in situ _ formation of these stars",
    "may be inhibited by the strong tidal forces in the central parsec .",
    "it is not clear that the maximum density of gas currently in the central parsec can be as high as the roche density required for a cloud to remain bound , @xmath7 for galactocentric radius @xmath8 .",
    "jackson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) report a density of a few times @xmath9 at a distance of @xmath10  pc , while christopher et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that densities approaching the limiting roche density can be found at a distance of @xmath11  pc ; ( see the discussion in   [ sec : results ] below )    one possibility is that the gravitational collapse leading to the formation of the present cluster of young stars in the central parsec was triggered by infall of a particularly dense gas cloud , which experienced compression by shocks involving cloud - cloud collisions , self - intersecting gas streams , or violent explosions near or at the central black hole ( morris 1993 ; sanders 1998 ; morris , ghez & becklin 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , the star cluster could have formed outside the central parsec , where tidal forces are relatively weaker and star formation is consequently less problematic , and later migrated into the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "gerhard ( 2001 ) proposes that dynamical friction can bring a massive young star cluster , initially embedded in its parent molecular cloud , into the central parsec during the lifetime of its most massive stars , depending on the initial location and mass of the cluster .",
    "the drag force represented by dynamical friction , acting in the direction opposite to the cluster motion , is owed to the induced `` wake '' of background stars .",
    "if the star cluster is massive enough , the resulting deceleration can in principle be large enough to cause the cluster to spiral into the gc .",
    "kim & morris ( 2003 ; paper i hereafter ) performed numerical simulations of dynamical friction suffered by star clusters near the galactic center , and found that dynamical friction can indeed bring star clusters formed outside the central parsec into the central parsec .",
    "however , this is only possible if the cluster is either very massive ( @xmath12 ) or is formed near the central parsec ( @xmath13  pc ) . in both cases ,",
    "the cluster should have an initally very dense core ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these extreme requirements make the dynamical friction scenario rather implausible .",
    "clusters with smaller masses , larger galactocentric radii , and/or smaller core densities either 1 ) completely evaporate before reaching the central parsec due to increasingly strong tidal forces that the cluster must endure during the inward migration , or 2 ) do not reach the central parsec within the lifetime of young , massive stars .",
    "mcmillan & portegies zwart ( 2003 ) presented semianalytic calculations of the inspiral of star clusters near the gc to study the parameter space in which the cluster can reach the central parsec of the galaxy within a few million years . while they performed simplified semianalytic calculations to explore a wide range of parameter space , paper i implemented a numerical treatment that models both the cluster and the inner part of the galaxy with a large number of particles to accurately model the final dissolution phase of the cluster .",
    "the amount of mass deposited in the central parsec can be estimated more accurately in this way , and this estimation was the main goal of paper i.    recently , hansen & milosavljevi ( 2003 ) suggested that if a cluster formed outside the central parsec harbors an intermediate - mass ( @xmath15@xmath16 ) black hole ( imbh ) , the dynamical friction scenario may work with more plausible initial cluster conditions .",
    "the idea is that the deep potential well induced by the imbh at the center of the cluster may be able to keep the cluster core intact against tidal disruption for a longer time during the inward migration by dynamical friction so that the cluster core can reach the central parsec .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine with the ( semi)analytic approach of hansen & milosavljevi ( 2003 ) 1 ) how long the imbh can hold the cluster core intact , and 2 ) how much stellar mass would ultimately be deposited into the central parsec after cluster dissolution .",
    "the present study carries out numerical simulations of dynamical friction on gc star clusters having an imbh using the same numerical method as in paper i in order to answer these questions .",
    "we use the same numerical models as in paper i , except that the clusters in the present study harbor an imbh at the center . here",
    "we briefly describe our models , and readers are referred to paper i for a detailed model description .",
    "we use a parallelized n - body / sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) code named gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) , which computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm and represents fluids by means of sph .",
    "we implement only the gravitational part of the code .    to model the potential of the central region of the galaxy , we adopt a truncated , softened , spherical , power - law density profile : @xmath17 this is a density model from genzel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with an added exponential truncation , scaled by @xmath18  pc .",
    "the outer boundary of the galaxy is set to be 25  pc .",
    "the net angular momentum of the galaxy is assumed to be zero .",
    "we use @xmath19 particles to model the galaxy , and the total galaxy mass represented in our model is @xmath20 . for models 2 & 3 in table 1 of paper",
    "i are erroneous and should read @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . ]",
    "thus the mass represented by a single galaxy particle is @xmath23 .    for the initial stellar density profile of the cluster",
    ", we adopt the plummer density profile , @xmath24 clusters in our simulations initially have a total cluster mass @xmath25 of @xmath26 , galactocentric radius @xmath8 of 5  pc , core radius @xmath27 of 0.13  pc , and tidal radius @xmath28 of 0.77  pc ( thus @xmath29 )",
    ". the number of particles for the cluster is @xmath30 , making the mass of each cluster particle @xmath31 ( this number is not exactly @xmath32 because @xmath25 includes the mass of the imbh , which is represented by a single particle ) .",
    "ccccc 1 & 0.5 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & 0.00 2 & 0.5 & @xmath35 & @xmath36 & 0.06 3 & 0.5 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & 0.05 4 & 0.5 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & 0.04 5 & 0.2 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & 0.05    the plummer density profile we adopted above is only for the stellar component , and we place an imbh at the center of this profile .",
    "however , an equilibrium configuration may not always be achievable when an imbh is added to this profile ( a part of the distribution function @xmath41 may become negative if the imbh mass added is too large ; see binney & tremaine 1987 for details ) .",
    "it turns out that for the mass range of the imbhs we consider in the present study , equilibrium is not available without modifying the adopted stellar density profiles .",
    "we find that equilibrium is achievable when stars inside a certain small radius from the cluster center , @xmath42 , are removed ( once the simulation begins , the initial void of stars near the imbh will be quickly filled by stars that are deflected into the void by two - body interactions , and the cluster will try to reach the new equilibrium ) .",
    "the values of @xmath42 that we choose are the minimum radii that allow equilibrium for the system , and are shown in table  [ table : sim ] .",
    "each simulation has a different initial central density ( @xmath43 ) because of different @xmath42 values .",
    "the initial orbital eccentricity is expressed in terms of the initial orbital velocity , @xmath44 , relative to the circular velocity at a given @xmath8 , @xmath45 , and our clusters initially have a tangential velocity only .",
    "our simulations have @xmath46 of either 0.5 or 0.2 .",
    "such significantly non - circular initial orbits might result from cloud - cloud collisions , which is one of the possible mechanisms for forming a relatively massive cluster near the central parsec .",
    "such highly eccentric initial orbits will make the dynamical friction more effective , as the cluster will experience its largest tidal forces near its periapse position .",
    "since this assumption favors the process we are investigating , it strengthens our conclusion in what follows that the process is unlikely to be operating in the gc .",
    "as discussed in paper i , clusters with @xmath47 would initially contain more than a thousand ymss , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than currently observed in the central parsec ( there are very few ymss outside this region except for two very young star clusters at least 30  pc from the gc with a mass of order of @xmath16 , the arches cluster and the quintuplet cluster ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath25 is less than @xmath16 , the number of ymss in the cluster would be only a fraction of what is currently observed in the central parsec , and one would need successive inspirals of several clusters to explain the observed number of ymss .",
    "thus we choose @xmath25 = @xmath26 for our clusters .",
    "= 8.0 cm    figure  [ fig : compare ] compares the evolution of the radial distribution of cluster particles of simulation  1 ( simulation 8 of paper i ) and simulation  2 , which have the same initial conditions except that the former does not have an imbh .",
    "the orbital evolution shows a periodic oscillation simply because the clusters initially have elliptical orbits .",
    "this plot dramatically shows the role of the imbh in making the cluster core more stable against tidal disruption and prolonging its inward migration to smaller galactocentric radius . while the whole cluster of simulation  1 completely disrupts when reaching @xmath48  pc and is spread over the region between 0.8 and 3.5  pc , in the case of simulation  2 , where the cluster harbors an imbh at its center , only the halo of the cluster disrupts outside the central parsec and the core continues to spiral in to the central parsec .",
    "although the location of the imbh is not plotted in this figure , we find that the imbh and the core are tightly bound to each other until the core is dissolved inside the central parsec at @xmath49  myr .",
    "paper i showed that without the imbh , a @xmath26 cluster must have @xmath43 of at least @xmath14 to deliver its core to the central parsec within the lifetime of the ymss , but simulation  2 lowers this requirement by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "the initial @xmath43 of simulation 2 , @xmath50 , can often be observed in the cores of dense globular clusters , and is close to the density estimated for the early phase of the arches cluster ( kim et al .",
    "2000 ) .      figure  [ fig : main]b shows the location of the imbh and the mass of the cluster stars ( not including the imbh ) located inside the central parsec , @xmath51 , as a function of time for simulation  2 .",
    "@xmath52 increases as the imbh enters the central parsec , and reaches its asymptotic value when the cluster core is completely dissolved .",
    "the stellar mass deposited in the central parsec is @xmath53 for simulation  2 , which is approximately three times larger than that of simulation  1 ( figure  [ fig : main]a ) .",
    "clusters formed near the gc are expected to undergo very rapid dynamical mass segregation during the first few @xmath54  yr ( kim , morris , & lee 1999 ) .",
    "thus by the time the core sinks to the central parsec and dissolves therein , the core will be largely dominated by the most massive stars . if we assume that the typical mass of a yms is @xmath55 and the number of central parsec stars presumed to be ymss is 50 , then the total mass of ymss in the central parsec is @xmath56 .",
    "this value is sufficiently less than @xmath52 at the end of the simulation that , allowing for a reasonable initial mass function , we expect that almost all ymss formed in the cluster of simulation  2 are transported into the central parsec .",
    "@xmath52 at the end of simulation  1 is @xmath57 , which equals the estimated mass of ymss in the central parsec .",
    "but only a few stars of simulation  1 are located inside @xmath58  pc , while most of the observed ymss are located inside @xmath58  pc .",
    "the presence of the imbh in simulation  2 not only increases @xmath52 , but also transports the core stars deeper into the gc , as shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "it may appear that simulation  2 is a good scenario to explain the presence of ymss in the central parsec , but there is nonetheless a rather serious problem with it : the imbh in simulation  2 is too massive compared to the total cluster mass ( 20  % of the cluster mass ) .",
    "the typical core mass in a cluster is @xmath10  % of the cluster mass , so even if all the stars in the cluster core turn into an imbh , it is still far smaller than the imbh of simulation  2 . furthermore , portegies zwart & mcmillan ( 2002 ) estimate that an object resulting from the runaway growth through stellar collisions can grow only up to @xmath59  % of the cluster mass .",
    "the imbh could grow further by accreting remnant gaseous material left over from the cluster formation before the gas gets blown away by massive stars , but it seems highly unlikely that there would be enough gaseous material for the imbh mass to grow by a factor of 10 to 100 by accretion in just a few million years .",
    "clusters having imbhs smaller than that of simulation  2 would be more realistic , but then the stabilization of the cluster core by the imbh would be less effective . by comparing simulations 2 , 3 , and 4 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : main]b , c , & d ) , which have the same initial conditions except for the imbh mass , we find that the minimum imbh mass fraction required to bring the core of the @xmath26 cluster to the central parsec is @xmath0  % ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "@xmath52 at the end of simulation  4 is almost the same as that of simulation  1 , where there is no imbh .",
    "it takes more than 6  myr for the core of simulation  3 to migrate to the central parsec and dump the stars there , and this time is close to the upper limit of the estimated age of the ymss in the central parsec",
    ".    a more eccentric initial cluster orbit could be more effective for the inward migration of the cluster core because the cluster would experience higher galactic stellar densities at earlier times . however , simulation  5 ( figure  [ fig : main]e ) , which has @xmath61 , shows that @xmath52 is not sensitively dependent on the initial eccentricity of the cluster orbit .",
    "we also performed a couple of simulations with an initial density profile from the king model ( king 1966 ) with a concentration parameter @xmath62 , which represents a highly concentrated profile for a cluster , but found that the results are nearly identical to the simulations with the plummer initial profiles .",
    "this shows that our results are probably not sensitive to the choice of the initial density profile .",
    "initial @xmath8 values other than 5  pc were not tried in the present study , but as found in paper i , survival of the cluster depends on the initial @xmath43 , but not sensitively on the initial @xmath8 .    after trying and considering various different initial conditions for the cluster ,",
    "we conclude that the presence of an imbh that occupies less than @xmath0  % of the total cluster does not greatly increase the amount of stars deposited in the central parsec .",
    "the simulation method adopted in the present study properly describes dynamical friction , but may not accurately follow internal dynamical evolution of star clusters due to the use of a rather large softening parameter ( see paper i ) , as well as to the uniformity of the model stellar masses , which can not therefore reproduce mass segregation in the cluster .",
    "the two - body relaxation times at the core of our clusters are of order of @xmath54  yr , so some cluster cores may experience significant dynamical evolution during our simulation periods . in star clusters with a black hole of a considerable mass , the core density gradually decreases by the loss of stars to the black hole and the expansion of the core ( rauch 1999 , freitag & benz 2002 ) . this density decrease is probably underestimated in our simulations , thus the actual initial core densities and black hole mass fraction required to explain the ymss in the central parsec are probably even higher than implied by our results .",
    "we note that from high spatial resolution millimeter line observations of the inner four parsecs of the gc , christopher et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that some of the molecular clumps in the circumnuclear disk ( @xmath63 ) appear to be dense enough to surpass the roche limit in the central parsec .",
    "the virial densities of their clumps range between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the virial masses range between @xmath15 and @xmath26 .",
    "simulations in paper i suggest that a cluster formed from the heaviest clump in the christopher et al .",
    "observations ( an inferred @xmath66 ) may be able to spiral into the central parsec within the lifetime of the ymss , even without an imbh .",
