    "computing the volume and/or integrating on a subset @xmath0 is a challenging problem with many important applications .",
    "one possibility is to use basic monte carlo techniques that generate points uniformly in a box containing @xmath1 and then count the proportion of points falling into @xmath1 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all other approximate ( deterministic or randomized ) or exact techniques deal with polytopes or convex bodies only . similarly , powerful cubature formulas exist for numerical integration against a weight function on simple sets ( like e.g. simplex , box ) , but not for arbitrary semi - algebraic sets .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce a deterministic technique that potentially applies to any basic compact semi - algebraic set @xmath0 .",
    "it is deterministic ( no randomization ) and differs from previous ones in the literature essentially dedicated to _",
    "convex _ bodies ( and more particularly , convex polytopes ) . indeed , one treats the original problem as an infinite dimensional optimization ( and even linear programming ( lp ) ) problem whose unknown is the lebesgue measure on @xmath1 .",
    "next , by restricting to finitely many of its moments , and using a certain characterization on the @xmath1-moment problem , one ends up in solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problems whose size is parametrized by the number of moments considered ; the dual lp has a simple interpretation and from this viewpoint , convexity of @xmath1 does not help much . for a certain choice of the criterion to optimize , one obtains a monotone non increasing sequence of upper bounds on the volume of @xmath1 .",
    "convergence to the exact value invokes results on the @xmath1-moment problem by putinar @xcite .",
    "importantly , there is _ no _ convexity and not even connectedness assumption on @xmath1 , as this plays no role in the @xmath1-moment problem . alternatively , using a different characterization of the @xmath1-moment problem due to krivine @xcite , one may solve a hierarchy of lp ( instead of sdp ) problems whose size is also parametrized by the number of moments .",
    "our contribution is a new addition to the already very long list of applications of the moment approach ( some of them described in e.g. landau @xcite and lasserre @xcite ) and semidefinite programming @xcite . in principle",
    ", the method also permits to approximate any finite number of moments of the uniform distribution on @xmath1 , and so provides a means to approximate the integral of a polynomial on @xmath1 . extension to integration against a weight function",

    "* background .",
    "* computing or even approximating the volume of a convex body is hard theoretically and in practice as well .",
    "even if @xmath0 is a convex polytope , exact computation of its volume or integration over @xmath1 is a computational challenge .",
    "computational complexity of these problems is discussed in e.g. bollobs @xcite and dyer and frieze @xcite . any deterministic algorithm with polynomial time complexity that would compute an upper bound @xmath2 and a lower bound @xmath3 on @xmath4",
    "can not yield an upper bound on the ratio @xmath5 better than polynomial in the dimension @xmath6 .",
    "methods for exact volume computation use either triangulations or simplicial decompositions depending on whether the polytope has a half - space description or a vertex description .",
    "see e.g. cohen and hickey , @xcite , lasserre @xcite , lawrence @xcite and see beler et al .",
    "@xcite for a comparison .",
    "another set of methods which use generating functions are described in e.g. barvinok @xcite and lasserre and zeron @xcite . concerning integration on simple sets ( e.g. simplex , box ) via cubature formulas ,",

    "however , lovsz @xcite proved that there is a polynomial - time algorithm that produces @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfying @xmath13 , whereas elekes @xcite proved that for @xmath14 there is no polynomial - time algorithm that produces @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "if one accepts randomized algorithms that fail with small probability , then the situation is more favorable .",
    "indeed , the celebrated dyer , frieze and kanan probabilistic approximation algorithm @xcite computes the volume to fixed arbitrary relative precision @xmath16 , in time polynomial in @xmath17 .",
    "the latter algorithm uses approximation schemes based on rapidly mixing markov chains and isoperimetric inequalities .",

    "hence @xmath1 is possibly non - convex and non - connected .",
    "therefore , in view of the above discussion , this is quite a challenging problem .",
    "\\(a ) we present a numerical scheme that depends on a parameter @xmath20 , a polynomial that is nonnegative on @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath21 ) . for each parameter @xmath20",
    ", it provides converging approximations of moments of the measure uniformly supported on @xmath1 ( with mass equal to @xmath4 ) . for the choice @xmath21 one obtains a _ monotone _ non - increasing sequence of upper bounds that converges to @xmath4 .",
    "\\(b ) the way we see the problem dates back to the 19th century pioneer work in the one - dimensional case by chebyshev @xcite , markov @xcite and stieltjes @xcite , where given @xmath6 moments @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , one wishes to approximate the integral @xmath25 and analyzes asymptotics as @xmath26 ; characterizing feasible sequence @xmath27 is referred to as the markov moment problem ( and @xmath28-moment problem if in addition one requires @xmath29 for some scalar @xmath28 ) . for an historical account on this problem as well as other developments ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to e.g. krein @xcite , krein and nuldelman @xcite , karlin and studden @xcite and putinar @xcite .",
    "our method combines a simple idea , easy to describe , with relatively recent powerful results on the @xmath1-moment problem described in e.g. @xcite .",
    "it only requires knowledge of a set @xmath30 ( containing @xmath1 ) simple enough so that the moments of the lebesgue measure on @xmath30 can be obtained easily .",
    "for instance @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( the scaled @xmath6-dimensional ball ) or @xmath33 ( the scaled @xmath6-dimensional box ) and @xmath34 a given constant . then computing @xmath4 is equivalent to computing the mass of the borel measure @xmath35 which is the restriction to @xmath1 of the lebesgue measure on @xmath30 . this in turn is translated into an infinite dimensional lp problem @xmath36 with parameter @xmath20 ( some polynomial nonnegative on @xmath1 ) and with the borel measure @xmath35 as unknown .",
    "then , from certain results on the @xmath1-moment problem and its dual theory of the representation of polynomials positive on @xmath1 , problem @xmath36 can be approximated by an appropriate hierarchy of semidefinite programs ( sdp ) whose size depends on the number @xmath37 of moments of @xmath35 considered .",
    "one obtains approximations of the moments of @xmath35 which converge to the exact value as @xmath38 . for the choice @xmath21 of the parameter @xmath20 , one even obtains an non - increasing sequence of upper bounds converging to @xmath4 .",
    "asymptotic convergence is ensured by invoking results of putinar @xcite on the @xmath1-moment problem .",
    "alternatively , one may replace the sdp hierarchy with an lp hierarchy and now invoke results of krivine @xcite for convergence .",
    "interestingly , the dual of each sdp relaxation defines a strenghtening of @xmath39 , the lp dual of @xmath36 , and highlights why the problem of computing the volume is difficult .",
    "indeed , one has to approximate from above the function @xmath40 ( @xmath41 on @xmath1 and @xmath42 on @xmath43 ) by a polynomial @xmath44 of bounded degree , so as to minimize the integral @xmath45",
    ". from this viewpoint , convexity of @xmath1 plays no particular role and so , does not help much .",
    "\\(c ) let @xmath46 be fixed , arbitrary .",
    "one obtains an approximation of the moments of degree up to @xmath37 of the measure @xmath35 on @xmath1 , as closely as desired .",
    "therefore , this technique also provides a sequence of approximations that converges to @xmath47 for _ any _ polynomial @xmath48 of degree at most @xmath37 ( in contrast , monte carlo simulation is for a given @xmath48 ) .",
    "finally , we also propose a similar approximation scheme for integrating a polynomial on @xmath1 against a nonnegative weight function @xmath49 .",
    "the only required data are moments of the measure @xmath50 on a simple set @xmath30 ( e.g. box or simplex ) containing @xmath1 , which can be obtained by usual cubature formulas for integration .",
    "+ on the practical side , at each step @xmath37 of the hierarchy , the computational workload is that of solving an sdp problem of increasing size . in principle , this can be done in time polynomial in the input size of the sdp problem , at given relative accuracy .",
    "however , in view of the present status and limitations of current sdp solvers , so far the method is restricted to problems of small dimension @xmath6 if one wishes to obtain good approximations .",
    "the alternative lp hierarchy might be preferable for larger size problems , even if proved to be less efficient when used in other contexts where the moment approach applies , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "preliminary results on simple problems for which @xmath4 is known show that indeed convexity plays no particular role .",
    "in addition , as for interpolation problems , the choice of the basis of polynomials is crucial from the viewpoint of numerical precision .",
    "this is illustrated on a trival example on the real line where , as expected , the basis of chebyshev polynomials is far better than the usual monomial basis .",
    "in fact , it is conjectured that trigonometric polynomials would be probably the best choice .",
    "finally , the choice of the parameter @xmath20 is also very important and unfortunately , the choice of @xmath21 which guarantees a monotone convergence to @xmath4 is not the best choice at all .",
    "best results are obtained when @xmath20 is negative outside @xmath1 .",
    "so far , for convex polytopes , this method is certainly not competitive with exact specific methods as those described in e.g. @xcite .",
    "it rather should be viewed as a relatively simple deterministic methodology that applies to a very general context for which even getting good bounds on @xmath4 is very difficult , and for which the only alternative presently available seems to be brute force monte carlo .",
