    "quantum metrology is a research field that examines the characteristic fundamental properties of measurements under the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of this is to achieve measurements at the information theoretical bounds allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics , far beyond their classical counterparts . for optical system",
    "the classic and extremely well studied example are noon states @xcite whose performance allows them to measure linear phase shifts at the heisenberg limit .",
    "several theoretical studies have recently investigated the role of non - linearity to help improve the limits of phase enhancement in linear systems @xcite and the first demonstration of this so - called super - heisenberg scaling has been shown @xcite .",
    "the particle - loss and decoherence mechanisms are , however , not fully explored in combined linear and non - linear interferometers , even theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is not only noon states that allow linear phase measurements at the heisenberg limit .",
    "entangled coherent states ( ecss ) @xcite are also able to do this @xcite and can outperform that of noon states in the region of very modest particle numbers with a linear phase operation @xcite .",
    "an important case of entangled coherent states are the two - mode path entangled states , a state analogous to a noon state , but with one of two modes containing a coherent state rather than a fock state @xcite .",
    "this particular ecs can be represented as a superposition of noon states with different photon numbers @xcite . using linear optical elements",
    ", the phase sensitivity of ecss outperforms that of noon and bat states @xcite , both without@xcite and with losses @xcite , because coherent states maintain their properties in the presence of loss .",
    "given all this recent work , a natural question arises regarding comparison of the phase enhancement for ecss , compared to noon and other states , in the case of non - linear phase shifts @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to investigate the non - linear phase enhancement resulting from a generalized non - linearity characterized by an exponent @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) on four quantum states : noon , even and odd ecss and an approximated ecs ( aecs ) .",
    "the aecs is created from a photon subtracted squeezed state and experimentally feasible to realize @xcite .",
    "potential enhancements will be quantified with the quantum fisher information @xcite . to begin we will consider a two - mode pure state @xmath3 and a generalized non - linear phase shifter @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator in spatial mode @xmath8 @xcite ( see the details in section [ sec2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 represents the order of the non - linearity .",
    "for example , @xmath9 corresponds to a linear phase shift on the state , @xmath10 a kerr phase shift and @xmath11 gives a more general non - linear effect in a phase operation .",
    "when the generalized phase operation @xmath4 is applied to mode 2 of @xmath3 , the resultant state is equal to @xmath12 where the value of @xmath13 for pure states is simply given by @xmath14 = 4 ( \\delta n^k)^2 ,   \\label{eq : fisher02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath18 denotes an average ( or mean ) photon number .    to allow a fair comparison of the phase sensitivity among the various different quantum states under consideration",
    ", we will use the same average photon number in one of two modes as the physical resource count for the states @xcite . for pure states",
    ", we shall demonstrate an inequality for the sensitivity among the three states : noon ( least sensitive ) , odd ecs and even ecs ( most sensitive ) .",
    "furthermore we will show that in the limit of large @xmath18 the aecs slightly better than the other three states .",
    "we shall also consider a small amount of loss for the dispersive and non - linear interferometer arm , because the non - linear medium providing the phase operation will generally also provide a scattering effect ( e.g. , particle losses ) @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate that , analogous to the linear case ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , the phase enhancement of ecss still outperforms that of noon states , even for non - linear cases ( @xmath20 ) .    for a physical realization",
    ", it is known that the ideal ecs can be generated by mixing through a 50:50 beam - splitter ( bs ) a coherent state and a coherent state superposition ( css ) @xcite , given by @xmath21 is a coherent state with amplitude @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since the css with small @xmath22 has been already demonstrated in experiments @xcite , the scheme of building aecss with a modest photon number may be experimentally feasible with very high fidelity in the near future @xcite .",
    "several experiments have demonstrated that non - linear phase operations can be realized in various set - ups .",
    "for example , self - kerr phase modulation ( @xmath24 ) has been measured as a function of electric field amplitudes in waters , fibers , nitrobenzene , rydberg states , etc . @xcite .",
    "notably , the phase shift dependent upon the applied field clearly follows theoretical predictions in the case of a rydberg electro - magnetically induced transparency medium ( see in fig .  3 in ref .",

    "the generation of squeezed vacuum states can be given by degenerate parametric down - conversion utilizing non - linearity @xcite and a series of experimental results shows that modest strengths of squeezing through second - harmonic generation is achievable with the current technology @xcite .",
    "the scheme of single - photon subtraction through an unbalanced bs from a squeezed vacuum has been already demonstrated @xcite .",
    "finally , generation of the odd ecs follows from the well known technique of mixing a traveling css with a controlled coherent state through a 50:50 beam - splitter ( bs ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : prepare01 ] , the schematics shows how to generate @xmath68 from a squeezed vacuum @xmath69 and a coherent state @xmath70 ( @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 is a squeezing parameter ) .",

    "we begin by preparing a squeezed vacuum @xmath69 and then performing single - photon subtraction by using @xmath76 ( @xmath77 : transmission rate ) and a single - photon detector .",
    "the resultant state is called an acss possessing a very high fidelity compared with the ideal odd css . in detail ,",
    "when a single photon is detected , the resultant state @xmath78 ( @xmath79 $ ] ) is given by @xmath80 for @xmath81 with the maximized fidelity between @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "fig : ideal01 ] ) .",
    "this is because the detailed shape of the aecs is slightly different from the ideal odd ecs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noonf ] , this advantage of phase enhancement can be explained by the fact that the distribution of @xmath104 is narrower but has a longer tail in the aecs , compared to a coherent state @xmath105 , indicating the photon distribution of @xmath106 , for the same average photon number .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 states might provide a minor contribution of phase enhancement in the aecs .",
    "for @xmath107 and that of coherent state @xmath105 with respect to photon number @xmath94 .",

    "it implies that the aecs reaches the peak amplitude in smaller @xmath94 and has a longer tail than the coherent state .",

    "in summary , we have analyzed phase enhancement of ecss for non - linear phase shifts , using quantum fisher information to quantify the results .",
    "as shown in linear optical elements @xcite , the phase sensitivity of ecss outperforms that of noon states for modest average photon numbers , converging to the limit of noon states for large average photon numbers .",
    "we have presented the form of generalized ( non - linear ) phase operations , in terms of the power of number operators , and obtained an inequality for the phase enhancement of noon states and odd and even ecss , all with respect to the same average photon number as a physical resource .",
    "we have also investigated the feasibility of creating aecs in optical set - ups based on current technology , and examined its phase sensitivity .",
    "finally , we have shown that the behavior of the phase sensitivity for ecss significantly outperforms that for noon states , for the @xmath24 non - linear example in the presence of small losses .",
    "the fidelity between the odd ecs @xmath90 and aecs @xmath89 is very high , but in general the aecs has more degrees of freedom with @xmath72 and @xmath22 ( see fig . [",
