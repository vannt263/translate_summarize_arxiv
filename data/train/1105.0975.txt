    "the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) is a nasa medium - class explorer mission designed to survey the entire sky in four infrared wavelengths , 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath2 m ( denoted @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 respectively ) @xcite .",
    "the final mission data products are a multi - epoch image atlas and source catalogs that will serve as an important legacy for future research . while wise s primary science goals are to find the most luminous galaxies in the entire universe and to find the closest and coolest stars , the survey has yielded observations of over 157,000 minor planets , including near - earth objects ( neos ) , main belt asteroids ( mbas ) , comets , hildas , trojans , centaurs , and scattered disk objects @xcite .",
    "this represents an improvement of nearly two orders of magnitude more objects observed than wise s predecessor mission , the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wise survey began on 14 january , 2010 , and the mission exhausted its primary tank cryogen on 5 august , 2010 .",
    "exhaustion of the secondary tank and the start of the neowise post - cryogenic mission occurred on 1 october , 2010 , and the survey ended on 31 january , 2011 .",
    "infrared observations of all classes of minor planets are useful for determining size and albedo distributions , as well as thermophysical properties such as thermal inertia , the magnitude of non - gravitational forces , and surface roughness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of the more than 157,000 objects detected by neowise , some have physical properties such as diameter , albedo , and subsolar temperature measured by independent means such as radar observations , _ in situ _ spacecraft visits , or stellar occultations .",
    "we can obtain diameters and albedos for the full sample of minor planets observed by wise , but this requires characterization of the systematic errors associated with using thermal models ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work",
    ", we have used a set of objects with well - known , independently measured diameters and @xmath0 magnitudes to test the ability of thermal models created using wise data to accurately compute diameter and albedo .",
    "figure [ fig : bandpasses ] shows model spectral energy distributions for minor planets with different effective temperatures with the wise bandpasses overplotted .",
    "the color corrections given by @xcite allow the zero points to be corrected to account for the effect of flux generated by objects with varying effective temperature being observed through non - monochromatic bandpasses .",
    "the absolute zero points and isophotal wavelengths of the wise passbands @xcite are calibrated using the particular kurucz photospheric spectrum for vega detailed by @xcite and validated absolutely to 1.1% by @xcite .",
    "the width of the wise passbands ( particularly @xmath5 ) means that it is necessary to apply a color correction for sources with a different spectrum than vega . for the vast majority of wise extra - solar sources ,",
    "these color correction terms are small ( only a few percent for a k2v star in @xmath5 , for example ) .",
    "however , for objects such as minor planets with effective temperatures as low as 100 k , the flux correction factor for @xmath5 exceeds a magnitude @xcite , and readers are strongly encouraged to consult the wise explanatory supplement and @xcite for precise values .",
    "@xcite also find a discrepancy between red and blue calibrators in bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 that require a -8% and + 4% adjustment to the zero point magnitudes in each band , respectively .",
    "the color corrections derived in @xcite were produced by integrating over the system s relative spectral response throughput , which was measured during ground - based tests prior to launch @xcite .",
    "we have compared the measured wise magnitudes to magnitudes derived from spherical thermal models created for 117 objects , all of which have diameters and/or albedos measured via _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements , radar studies , or stellar occultations . by comparing the predicted magnitudes to the as - measured magnitudes reported by the wise pipeline",
    ", we have verified that the color corrections derived in @xcite as a function of an object s effective temperature correctly reproduce observed physical parameters .",
    "we have used these objects to set limits on the systematic errors for diameters and albedos derived from wise observations of minor planets when using a spherical thermal model and the @xcite color corrections .",
    "finally , we have determined an empirical relationship between an object s subsolar temperature and its effective temperature , which is necessary for selecting the appropriate color correction for solar system objects from @xcite .",
    "we have assembled a list of objects with well - measured diameters and @xmath0 magnitudes that wise observed during the fully cryogenic portion of its mission ( table 1 ) .",
    "these objects were chosen because their physical measurements were obtained using methods largely independent of infrared model parameters , such as radar imaging , direct measurements from spacecraft visits or flybys , or stellar occultations .",
    "diameters and albedos derived from other infrared observatories such as iras , the _ spitzer space telescope _ , and ground - based observations were not used to verify the color corrections of @xcite due to the desire to produce an independent calibration without reference to other infrared observers model parameter assumptions . however , for some objects , such as those observed by @xcite , the radar diameter measurements were compared with iras diameters and were found to be consistent . of the @xmath1400 radar - observed asteroids ( _ http://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/index.html_ ) , a dozen or so spacecraft targets , and hundreds of occultation targets",
    ", we identified wise observations for 117 objects . in order to reduce the potential difficulties associated with applying a spherical thermal model to non - spherical objects ,",
    "we eliminated from further consideration all objects with peak - to - peak magnitude differences larger than 0.3 magnitudes in @xmath5 ; this reduced the sample to the 50 objects listed in table 1 .",
    "the observations of these objects were retrieved by querying the minor planet center s ( mpc ) observation files to look for all instances of individual wise detections of the desired objects that were reported using the wise moving object processing system ( wmops ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting set of position / time pairs were used as the basis of a query of wise source detections in individual exposures ( also known as  level 1b \" images ) using the infrared science archive ( irsa ) . in order to ensure that only observations of the desired moving object were returned from the query ,",
    "the search radius was restricted to 0.3 arcsec from the position listed in the mpc observation file .",
    "additionally , since wise collected a single exposure every 11 seconds and observes each part of the sky an average of 10 times , the modified julian date was required to be within 2 seconds of the time specified by the mpc .",
    "artifacts were minimized by setting the following flags : cc_flags = 0 or p and ph_qual = a , b , or c ( this flag indicates that the source is likely to have been a valid detection ) .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath7 and @xmath8 magnitudes were assumed to have flux errors equivalent to 0.2 magnitudes due to changes to the shape of the point spread function as the objects became saturated , and a linear correction was applied to the @xmath5 magnitudes in this brightness regime ( the wise explanatory supplement contains a more detailed explanation ) . per the explanatory supplement , objects brighter than @xmath9 and @xmath10 were not used .",
    "each object had to be observed a minimum of three times in at least one wise band , and it had to be detected at least 40% of the time when compared to the band with the maximum number of detections ( usually , though not always , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the wmops system is designed to reject inertially fixed objects such as stars and galaxies in bands @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "nonetheless , the individual images at all wavelengths were compared with wise atlas coadd and daily coadd source lists to ensure that inertially - fixed sources such as stars and galaxies were not coincident with the moving object detections . this check is particularly important in bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the density of background objects ( and hence the probability of a blended source ) is higher than at longer wavelengths .",
    "any remaining blended sources in bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 were removed .",
    "some objects were observed at multiple epochs , and observations separated by more than three days were modeled separately .",
    "the thermal flux from an airless sphere is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the object - to - observer distance , @xmath13 is the emissivity , @xmath14 is the object s radius , @xmath15 is the planck function , @xmath16 is the angle from the sub - observer point to a point on the asteroid such that @xmath16 is equal to the solar phase angle @xmath17 at the sub - solar point , and @xmath18 is an angle measured around the sub - observer point such that @xmath19 at the sub - solar point ( e.g , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to compute this flux , the temperature distribution across the body must be computed . in the standard thermal model ( stm ) of @xcite , the temperature of an asteroid is assumed to be maximum at the subsolar point and zero on the point opposite of this ; this is the case of an object with zero thermal inertia .",
    "in contrast , in the fast rotating model ( frm ) @xcite , the asteroid is assumed to be rotating much faster than its cooling time ( i.e. high thermal inertia ) , resulting in a constant surface temperature across all longitudes .",
    "the so - called  beaming parameter \" was introduced by @xcite in the stm to account for the enhancement of thermal radiation observed at small phase angles .",
    "the near - earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm ) of @xcite also uses the beaming parameter @xmath20 to account for cases intermediate between the stm and frm models , such that @xmath21^{1/4}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 the solar phase angle , and the sub - solar temperature @xmath22 is given by : @xmath23^{0.25}.\\ ] ]    the emissivity , @xmath13 , is assumed to be 0.9 for all wavelengths ( c.f .",

    "each object was modeled as a set of triangular facets covering a spherical surface with diameter equal to the ground - truth measurement ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "model magnitudes were computed for each wise measurement , ensuring that the correct sun - observer - object distances were used for each one .",
    "the temperature for each facet was computed , and the @xcite color corrections were applied to each facet .",
    "the emitted thermal flux for each facet was calculated using neatm along with the bandcenters and zero points given in @xcite ; the temperature at the anti - subsolar point was set to 3 k , so the facets closest to this point contribute little flux .",
    "the objects absolute magnitudes ( @xmath0 ) were taken from @xcite and @xcite when available ; otherwise , the values were taken from the mpc s orbital element files .",
    "although @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have applied a 0.3 magnitude offset to the @xmath0 values for objects in their respective works , we did not apply the offset to the @xmath0 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the offset was caused by the dominance of unfiltered ccd photometry in the mpc datafiles , largely from the linear survey ; as more filtered measurements have become available from other surveys in recent years , the offset is no longer appropriate to use .",
    "we will revisit these @xmath0 values as improved measurements become available .",
    "diameters and albedos computed from the combination of diameter and @xmath0 from the radar , spacecraft , or occultation measurements are given in table 1 .",
    "in addition , the saturnian moon phoebe had a measurement of subsolar temperature @xcite that was also used in the thermal model .",
    "@xmath0 value was taken from @xcite , and its @xmath28 value from @xcite .",
    "if an object had no prior independent measurement of geometric albedo ( @xmath29 ) from an _ in situ _ measurement , it was computed using the relationship @xmath30^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the object s absolute magnitude and @xmath31 is its diameter @xcite . for objects with three valid measurements in two or more wise bands dominated by thermal emission , @xmath20 was determined using a least squares minimization .    in general , minor planets detected by neowise in bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 contain a mix of reflected sunlight and thermal emission .",
    "thus , it was necessary to incorporate an estimate of reflected sunlight into the thermal model in order to use data from bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to compute the fraction of reflected sunlight in bands @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 , it was also necessary to compute the ratio of the infrared albedo @xmath32 to the visible albedo @xmath33 .",
    "we make the simplifying assumption that the reflectivity is the same in both bands @xmath3 and @xmath4 , such that @xmath34 ; the validity of this assumption is discussed below .",
    "the geometric albedo @xmath33 is defined as the ratio of the brightness of an object observed at zero phase angle ( @xmath17 ) to that of a perfectly diffusing lambertian disk of the same radius located at the same distance .",
    "the bond albedo ( @xmath24 ) is related to the visible geometric albedo @xmath33 by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the phase integral and is defined such that @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the phase curve , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath28 is the slope parameter that describes the shape of the phase curve in the @xmath41 model of @xcite that describes the relationship between an asteroid s brightness and the solar phase angle . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath36 is never larger than about 2/3 for any observed value of @xmath28 , the geometric albedo @xmath33 is not limited to @xmath441.0 ; it is possible to have a value as large as @xmath11.5 without violating conservation of energy .",
    "conversely , values of @xmath33 approaching 1.0 still amount to integral reflectivity ( bond albedo ) of @xmath160% , less than newly fallen snow , or other analogs of very high albedo .",
    "we make the assumption that @xmath32 obeys these same relationships , although it is possible that the phase integral described above varies with wavelength , so what we denote here as @xmath32 for convenience may not be exactly analogous to @xmath33 .",
    "the flux from reflected sunlight was computed for each wise band using the iau phase curve correction @xcite : @xmath45,\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the predicted apparent magnitude ; @xmath14 is the heliocentric distance in au ; @xmath12 is the geocentric distance in au ; @xmath17 is the sun - observer - object angle ; @xmath28 is slope parameter for the magnitude - phase relationship ; and @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48    unless a direct measurement of @xmath28 was available from @xcite or @xcite , we assumed a @xmath28 value of 0.15 .",
    "finally , the weighted averages of the model magnitude , measured wise magnitude and @xmath22 were computed for each object by grouping together observations no more than a three day gap between them .",
    "this was done to ensure that neos , which can have significant changes in distance over short times , were modeled accurately .",
    "error bars on the model magnitudes and subsolar temperatures were determined for each object by running 100 monte carlo trials that varied the objects @xmath0 values by the error bars given in table 1 , their diameters by the error bars specified in table 1 , and the wise magnitudes by their error bars using gaussian probability distributions .",
    "the minimum magnitude error for all wise measurements fainter than @xmath7 and @xmath49 magnitudes was 0.03 magnitudes , per the in - band repeatability measured in @xcite . for objects brighter than @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the error bars were increased to 0.2 magnitudes , as these magnitudes represent the onset of saturation . additionally , a linear correction was applied to objects with @xmath50 .",
    "the effect is thought to be caused by changes in the point spread function observed when images start to enter saturation ( see the wise explanatory supplement for a discussion of the effects of saturation on photometry ) .",
    "we have set the error bars to 0.2 magnitudes right at these limits in order to conservatively capture residual errors not fixed by the simple linear correction applied .",
    "objects with @xmath51 and @xmath52 were too bright to be used .",
    "the error bar for each object s model magnitude was equal to the standard deviation of all the monte carlo trial values .",
    "if a measurement of @xmath0 was not available from @xcite or @xcite , the error in @xmath0 was taken to be 0.3 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows an example of an asteroid s wise magnitudes as well as the resulting thermal model fit",
    ". figures [ fig : calibrators ] show the difference between the average measured wise magnitudes and the model magnitudes for bands @xmath3 through @xmath6 using the color corrections given in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we adjusted the @xmath5 effective wavelength blueward by 4% from 11.5608@xmath2 m to 11.0984 @xmath2 m , the @xmath6 effective wavelength redward by 2.5% from 22.0883 @xmath2 m to 22.6405 @xmath2 m , and we included the -8% and + 4% offsets to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 magnitude zeropoints ( respectively ) due to the red - blue calibrator discrepancy reported by @xcite .",
    "the weighted means of the differences between observed and model magnitudes shown in figure [ fig : calibrators ] are given in table 2 , and they are near zero for most objects .",
    "the apparent trend below zero for the objects with @xmath22 larger than @xmath1300 k could be due to any of the following causes : 1 ) imperfect knowledge of the system relative spectral response curves , particularly in @xmath6 ; 2 ) inaccuracies in either @xmath0 values or diameters for some of the objects ; 3 ) the temperature distribution may not precisely follow that given in equation 2 .",
    "this is less important for objects observed at low phase angles .",
    "the warmer objects observed by wise tend to be neos observed at higher phase angles , which could lead to the subsolar point contributing significantly more flux in the shorter wavelengths and the nightside of the object more flux at longer wavelengths .",
    "nevertheless , most of the predicted magnitudes are in good agreement with the observed magnitudes , indicating that the procedure given in @xcite for color correction is adequate .",
    "although many of the calibrator objects are known to be non - spherical ( e.g. from radar shape modeling or optical lightcurves ) , the wise observations generally consisted of @xmath110 - 12 observations per object uniformly distributed over @xmath136 hours @xcite , so on average , a wide range of rotational phases was sampled .",
    "although the variation in effective spherical diameter resulting from rotational effects tends to be averaged out , caution must be exercised when interpreting effective diameter results using spherical models for objects that are known to have large - amplitude lightcurve variations .",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurve_amplitudes ] shows the distribution of peak - to - peak @xmath5 amplitudes for the entire sample of 117 objects .",
    "we have compared the mean differences between observed and model magnitudes for the entire sample of 117 objects to the sample of only those 50 objects with peak - to - peak @xmath5 amplitudes @xmath53 magnitudes , and there is no significant difference in the result given in table 2 .",
    "nevertheless , to avoid any potential difficulties associated with applying spherical models to elongated objects , we excluded objects with peak - to - peak @xmath5 amplitudes from further analysis .",
    "( figure [ fig : calibrators ] shows the difference between observed and model magnitudes for only the 50 low - amplitude objects ) . for the objects in table 1 for which pole orientations could be found in the lightcurve database of @xcite , we computed the visible lightcurve amplitude at the aspect observed by wise and found that for these objects , the apparent amplitudes were @xmath540.3 magnitudes .",
    "the offsets and errors given in table 2 can be regarded as the minimum systematic errors in magnitude for minor planets observed by wise / neowise . since diameter is proportional to the square root of the thermal flux ( equation 1 ) , the minimum systematic diameter error due to uncertainties in the color correction is proportional to one - half the error in flux .",
    "these magnitude errors result in a minimum systematic error of @xmath15 - 10% for diameters derived from wise data ; they are of similar magnitude to the diameter uncertainties of most of the underlying radar and spacecraft measurements , which are @xmath110% ( references are given in table 1 ) .",
    "albedo is proportional to @xmath55 ( equation 4 ) , and so it is linearly proportional to flux to first order .",
    "therefore , minimum systematic errors on albedos computed from wise observations are @xmath110 - 20% , subject to the assumption that spherical effective diameters can be computed for non - spherical shapes ( future work will model the objects as non - spherical shapes and will use shape models and rotational information produced by lightcurve and radar studies ) .",
    "these should be regarded as minimum errors in cases of good signal - to - noise detections when the beaming parameter and the infrared albedo can be fit .",
    "it should also be noted that these error estimates apply only to objects as distant as saturn , as the most distant object we have considered herein is saturn s moon phoebe .",
    "objects observed by wise at greater distances ( and therefore lower temperatures ) may be subject to additional errors .",
    "the color corrections specified in @xcite are given as a function of input spectra that are assumed to blackbodies of different effective temperatures ( @xmath56 ) . in order to use the @xcite color corrections by computing only the subsolar temperature rather than a faceted thermophysical model for each object ,",
    "we have computed the relationship between @xmath22 and ( @xmath56 ) . the total flux ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 ) was computed using neatm by applying a color correction to each facet on the sphere based on the facet s blackbody temperature .",
    "the equivalent flux at the center wavelength of each bandpass is computed , @xmath59 ; since this is a monochromatic flux , the color corrections are unity .",
    "we then derive an effective flux correction ( @xmath60 ) which is given by @xmath61 the final step is to find the @xmath56 that gives the blackbody flux correction @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : tss_vs_teff ] shows the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath56 ; a least - squares fit to these points yields the relationship @xmath63 we excluded objects with more than 20% reflected sunlight in a given band because their color corrections will be dominated by the small corrections needed for a g star @xcite",
    ". a single object can contribute up to four points on this plot , one for each band it is detected in with less than 20% reflected sunlight .",
    "equation 9 provides a shortcut method to flux correct the wise magnitudes in lieu of performing the facet - by - facet correction described above with negligible additional error .",
    "for objects that were detected according to the criteria described above in either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , we computed the albedo at these wavelengths ( @xmath32 , assuming @xmath64 ) in addition to @xmath33 .",
    "although @xcite and @xcite assume that the albedo at 3.4 @xmath2 m is 1.4 times higher than @xmath33 , this result is based on seven s - type main belt asteroids observed at 3 @xmath2 m by @xcite .",
    "@xcite use observations of a number of neos observed by _ spitzer _ and find @xmath65 consistent with 1.4 , using the relationship between @xmath20 and @xmath17 defined by @xcite .",
    "we have not used the @xcite relationship to derive @xmath20 and instead have allowed it to vary .",
    "since we know the diameter and can derive @xmath33 from equation 4 , we fit @xmath20 independently for each object in table 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : beaming_hist ] shows the histogram of beaming parameters , and figure [ fig : phase_v_eta ] shows @xmath20 as a function of solar phase angle for the objects described in table 1 ; however , we expect to significantly improve upon this result in a future work by using the general population of asteroids observed by wise over a wide range of phase angles .",
    "figure [ fig : pvpir ] shows @xmath65 for the objects detected in @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; as shown in table 1 , they represent a mix of neos , mbas , and irregular satellites . the weighted average of the ratio of @xmath65 is @xmath66 . in computing @xmath65 , we have made the simplifying assumption that @xmath28 does not vary with wavelength , although it is known that @xmath28 increases slightly , from 0.15 to 0.20 , when going from @xmath15 to @xmath14 bands @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases , the variation in albedo with wavelength could be due to material and/or chemical properties ( c.f .",

    "a future work comparing both the infrared and visible albedos with known taxonomic classifications is in progress .",
    "the calibration methodology described in this work is not unique to the wise infrared data ; however , the uniquely large set of minor planet observations afforded by wise / neowise has permitted characterization of the systematic errors produced when applying spherical neatm models to a number of objects with previously measured diameters that span a wide range of populations .",
    "we have studied neos , main belt asteroids , and irregular satellites . in particular , the selection of an effective temperature to use when applying a literature color correction can cause large changes in the resultant best - fit diameter unless the relation between @xmath22 and @xmath56 is well - understood or a complete faceted model is employed .",
    "the color corrections described in @xcite have been used to produce an estimate of the minimum systematic errors in magnitudes for minor planets detected by wise / neowise @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the minimum diameter errors resulting from residual uncertainties in the color corrections and assumptions regarding @xmath28 , @xmath0 , and albedo are comparable to the uncertainties in the diameters measured by radar or _ in situ _ spacecraft imaging ( i.e. @xmath110% ) ; albedos can be determined to @xmath120% when good signal - to - noise multi - band wise measurements and visible data are available . however , we note that objects more distant than the trojan asteroids may be subject to increased systematic errors , as the most distant object studied in this work was saturn s moon phoebe .",
    "our model includes an estimate of reflected sunlight computed in all four bands , and we have computed albedos at 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath2 m as well as at visible wavelengths , which should yield interesting compositional insights when compared with spectroscopic taxonomic data .",
    "areas for future improvement of thermal models include studying the effects of observing at high phase angles , modeling non - spherical shapes , and allowing both @xmath28 and albedo to vary as a function of wavelength .",
    "all observations were processed with the pass 1 ( preliminary ) version of the wise data processing pipeline ; as the final version of the pipeline becomes available , which incorporates many improvements to instrumental calibration , we will revisit the thermal models for these objects .",
    "we have also derived a simple linear relationship between subsolar temperature and the effective temperature used in @xcite , which should facilitate appropriate choices of color corrections for the wise bandpasses .",
    "the thermal models computed herein are not intended to supplant the diameters measured by radar , in situ imaging or occultations , but rather they provide insight into the ability of spherical neatm thermal models to accurately determine diameter and albedo when applied to the general population of wise - observed minor planets for which these parameters have not been previously determined .",
    "this demonstrates that the wise dataset offers a powerful new means of characterizing physical parameters of minor planets with great accuracy .",
