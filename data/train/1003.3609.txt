    "a measurement of the decay @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) has been performed using the e787 apparatus @xcite at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) of brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "this decay is due to radiative effects in the semi - leptonic transition of @xmath9 decay ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the decay @xmath8 can proceed via inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) in which a photon is emitted from the charged particle in the initial or final state , and structure - dependent radiative decay ( sd ) which involves the emission of a photon from the intermediate states in the hadronic transition from @xmath7 to @xmath11 . for hadron",
    "decays in the energy region below 1 gev , the effective - field approach based on chiral symmetry , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , is applicable @xcite . at @xmath12 in chpt , a partial branching ratio @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 , where @xmath5 is the energy of the emitted photon and @xmath6 is the angle between the muon and the photon in the @xmath7 rest frame , is predicted to be @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the relative size of sd contribution is around 8 % .",
    "the first search for @xmath8 , which was performed in 1973 @xcite with @xmath7 decays at rest in a heavy - liquid bubble chamber , obtained @xmath13 mev@xmath16 at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "the @xmath17 decay in flight was studied by the istr+ spectrometer ; the ratio @xmath18 for the region @xmath19 mev was found to be @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "based on this value , the particle data group cited @xmath21 mev@xmath22 as @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay at rest was studied with the toroidal spectrometer of the e246 and e470 experiments at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron ; the @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 was found to be @xmath24 @xcite .    in this paper , we present results from the e787 experiment at the ags .",
    "we describe the analysis we have performed to observe the @xmath0 decay and the measurement of the partial branching ratio @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 .",
    "we compare our results to the predictions of chpt at @xmath12 . the @xmath21 mev@xmath22 was also determined and can be compared with the previous result .",
    "the spectra of @xmath8 observables based on chpt at @xmath12 @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_theory ] and are consistent with the spectra given in @xcite .",
    "e787 was a rare kaon - decay experiment studying @xmath25 @xcite and related decays @xcite using @xmath7 decays at rest .",
    "the data for the @xmath8 measurement were acquired during the 1998 run @xcite of the ags , using kaons of 710 mev/@xmath26 incident on the e787 apparatus at a rate of about 4 mhz .",
    "two stages of electrostatic particle separation in the beam line @xcite reduced the pion contamination at the e787 apparatus to 25% .",
    "the incident kaons were detected and identified by a erenkov counter , multi - wire proportional chambers and a beam counter . after being slowed by a beo degrader , 27% of the kaons came to rest in an active stopping target located at the center of the detector system @xcite in a 1.0 tesla solenoidal magnet ( fig .",
    "[ fig_detector ] ) .",
    "the 12-cm diameter target , which consisted of 0.5-cm square plastic scintillating fibers , provided initial tracking of the stopping kaon as well as the charged decay products .",
    "they passed through a 0.64-cm thick layer of plastic scintillation counters surrounding the target ( i - counters ) . a @xmath27 radiation length ( @xmath28 ) thick cylindrical drift - chamber @xcite provided tracking information for momentum determination",
    "the charged particles lost energy in an array of plastic scintillation counters called the range stack ( rs ) , which provided a measurement of kinetic energy and range ( equivalent cm of plastic scintillator ) of the charged track .",
    "the rs was segmented into 24 azimuthal sectors and 21 radial layers , totaling one @xmath28 .",
    "the rs counters in the first layer ( t - counters ) , which were 0.635-cm thick and 52-cm long , defined the solid angle acceptance for the charged track in the rs .",
    "the subsequent rs counters in the second layer ( l2-counters ) and beyond were 1.905-cm thick and 182-cm long .",
    "the rs counter in the sector and layer where the track came to rest was called the `` stopping counter '' .",
    "the rs counters were read out by phototubes attached to the upstream and downstream ends ; the output pulse shapes were recorded by 500-mhz sampling transient digitizers ( tds ) @xcite , which provided precise time and energy information for the hits in each counter .",
    "photons from kaon decays at rest in the target were detected by a hermetic calorimeter system surrounding the central region . the cylindrical barrel ( bl ) calorimeter , which was located immediately outside the rs and covered two thirds of the solid angle ,",
    "was used to reconstruct and measure the three photons from the @xmath8 decay ( i.e. two photons from the @xmath29 and the radiative photon ) .",
    "the bl calorimeter consisted of alternating layers of lead ( 0.1-cm thick ) and plastic scintillator ( 0.5-cm thick ) sheets , and about 29% of the electromagnetic shower energy was deposited in the scintillators .",
    "the bl was segmented azimuthally into 48 sectors and , in each sector , four radial groups of 16 , 18 , 20 and 21 lead - scintillator layers , respectively with increasing radius , formed bl modules totaling 14.3 @xmath28 .",
    "the modules were 190-cm in length along the beam axis .",
    "they were read out by phototubes attached to the upstream and downstream ends , and the outputs were recorded by time - to - digital converters ( tdcs ) and analogue - to - digital converters ( adcs ) .",
    "the two endcap calorimeters @xcite , additional  collar \" calorimeters for filling minor openings along the beam direction , and any active parts of the detector not hit by the charged track were used for detecting extra particles .",
    "the signature of the @xmath8 decay was a kaon decay at rest with a charged track in the rs and three electromagnetic showers in the bl calorimeter .",
    "the kinetic energy of most of the muons from @xmath8 after requiring @xmath30 mev and @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_theory ] ) is less than 85 mev ; thus , we used the rs counters in the first six layers for the muon measurement .",
    "the rs counters in the 7th layer and beyond were used to detect extra particles or reject photons whose showers started before reaching the bl .    in the trigger for the @xmath8 decay ,",
    "the `` 3@xmath31 trigger '' , a kaon was identified by a coincidence of hits from the erenkov counter , beam counter and target . to guarantee that the kaon actually decayed at rest",
    ", the timing of the outgoing particle ( via the i - counters ) was required to be at least 1.5 nsec later than the timing of the incoming kaon ( via the erenkov counter ) .",
    "a positively charged track was required to have a coincidence of the hits from the i - counters , a t - counter and an l2-counter in the same rs sector ( t@xmath322 sector ) , and from the counters in the 3rd or 4th rs layer in the t@xmath322 sector or in either of the next two clockwise sectors .",
    "the tracks reaching the 7th or 8th layer were rejected . with such trigger conditions , only tracks for which the rs stopping counter was located in the 3rd to the 6th layer , corresponding to the muons with momentum 100 - 160 mev/@xmath26 , were accepted .    in order to count the number of showers in the bl calorimeter online ,",
    "the analog sum of the outputs from 8 modules in two adjacent sectors , separately for the upstream and downstream ends , were accepted with a threshold corresponding to about 5 mev of visible energy per end .",
    "the discriminator outputs were or - ed for either end , and then fed into a logic unit .",
    "the number of showers was required to be equal to three or larger .",
    "an event was rejected online if the visible energy in the endcap calorimeters was more than 20 mev , the energy in the rs sectors outside the region of the charged track was more than 10 mev , or the energy in the rs counters from the 9th to 21st layers in any sector was larger than the level for minimum ionizing particles .",
    "the 3@xmath31 trigger was prescaled by five for taking data simultaneously with the trigger for @xmath25 .",
    "approximately 6 events per slow - extracted beam ( 2.2-sec duration ) from the ags in every 4.2 sec were recorded . a total exposure of kaons entering the target available for the @xmath8 measurement was @xmath33 .",
    "a total of @xmath34 triggered events were collected .",
    "monte carlo simulation was performed to generate samples of @xmath8 as well as other kaon decays at rest in the e787 detector system .",
    "the simulation package developed for e787 was comprised of the electromagnetic - shower simulation routines from egs4  @xcite , the routines to model other physics processes such as particle decays and charged - particle interactions in the detector elements , and the routines to simulate the trigger conditions .",
    "the events in the monte carlo samples can be analyzed with the same analysis codes for real data , except that the information on the pulse shapes in the digitizers and the information on the outputs from most of the beam instrumentation were not stored .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of e787 is described in @xcite .",
    "the charged track was reconstructed and measured with a standard algorithm used in the @xmath25 analysis of e787 described in @xcite , except that the charged particle was assumed to be a muon and all the energy deposited in the rs stopping counter was attributed to the muon track coming to rest   track reconstruction , the presence of the additional 4 mev deposit in the rs stopping counter due to the @xmath35 decay at rest was assumed and was subtracted from the observed energy . ] .",
    "the initial momentum was determined by correcting the momentum measured in the drift chamber for the energy loss suffered by the muon based on the observed track length in the target .",
    "the kinetic energy was determined by adding up the energy deposits of the muon track in the scintillators of the target and the rs , taking account of the energy loss in inactive materials such as wrapping and chamber materials .",
    "the range was calculated from the track length in the target and in the rs , and was used for muon identification in the @xmath36 analysis .",
    "events were discarded if the momentum of the charged particle was larger than 190 mev/@xmath26 .",
    "many of the triggered events were due to the @xmath37 decay for which the @xmath38 had interactions within the rs counters before coming to rest ; these events were easily rejected because the @xmath38 momentum ( 205 mev/@xmath26 ) was measured with the drift chamber .",
    "the isolated showers in the bl calorimeter were reconstructed and the timing , energy and direction of the photons were measured with the same algorithm used in the analysis of e787 and e949 ( the successor experiment to e787 ) @xcite for kaon decays with photons in the final states @xcite .",
    "the muon track in the rs defined the event time reference , and adjacent bl modules whose timing was within @xmath39 nsec of the track time and whose visible energy was more than 0.2 mev were grouped into a  cluster \" . in each module , the energy was measured as the geometrical mean of the visible energies divided by the calibrated visible fraction ( @xmath40 ) in the upstream and downstream ends .",
    "the hit position in the end view of the detector was determined by the segmentation of the modules ; the hit position along the beam axis ( @xmath41 ) was measured from the end - to - end time and energy differences .",
    "the location of the shower in the bl was obtained by taking an energy - weighted average of the hit positions in the same cluster and , in conjunction with the kaon decay vertex position in the target , the azimuthal angle and the polar angle with respect to the beam axis were determined for each photon . in the @xmath36 analysis ,",
    "if two showers were separated by less than 55 cm and the energy of one of them was less than 25 mev , they were combined to a single shower in order to avoid misidentifying a part of an electromagnetic shower to be a separate one .",
    "events were discarded unless three or four showers were observed in the bl calorimeter .",
    "selection criteria (  cuts \" ) were imposed to make sure that the trigger conditions were satisfied and the kaon in the initial state and the muon and photons in the final state were reconstructed within the fiducial volume of the detector system .",
    "furthermore , cuts on the timing and energy of the hits recorded in the erenkov counter , proportional chambers , beam counter and the target , including an offline delayed - coincidence cut which required @xmath42 nsec between the muon time and the kaon time measured in the target , were imposed to remove the events triggered by kaon decays in flight or by multiple beam particles into the detector . from the triggered events",
    ", @xmath43 events survived and were used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "kaon decays with a single charged track in the region 100 - 160 mev/@xmath26 and at least one @xmath29 in the final state , i.e. , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , are potential background sources .",
    "they are classified as follows :    @xmath10 decays associated with an extra cluster in the bl due to accidental hits .",
    "@xmath10 decays associated with an extra cluster in the bl when the showers due to the two photons from @xmath29 were reconstructed as three showers .",
    "@xmath46 decay events in which the @xmath38 was misidentified as a muon or decayed in flight before it came to rest in the rs .",
    "@xmath50 decays for which the @xmath53 was misidentified as a muon , or @xmath48 decays with the @xmath54 misidentification and an extra cluster in the bl or a photon due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "@xmath52 decays in which the @xmath38 was misidentified as a muon or decayed in flight before it came to rest in the rs , and at the same time one of the four photons from two @xmath29 s was undetected .",
    "background due to multiple beam particles scattering into the detector simultaneously was found to be negligible .    in the subsequent two sections ,",
    "the cuts to improve the signal - to - background and measure the background are described .",
    "the cuts were developed with the sample of real data prescaled by three and the monte carlo samples .",
    "the studies of these samples confirmed that the expected number of candidate events in the signal region was larger than the background expectation .",
    "the cuts were then imposed to the entire dataset .",
    "for muon identification , a cut based on the measured range compared to that expected given the measured muon momentum was imposed .",
    "the measured range was also compared to the measured kinetic energy .",
    "furthermore , to reject @xmath54 tracks in the rs , a set of cuts that checked the consistency between the measured energy and range in each of the rs counters , the @xmath55 cuts , were employed .    for the @xmath36 decay , events were discarded unless exactly three showers with @xmath56 mev were observed in the bl calorimeter within @xmath57 nsec of the muon track time in the rs .",
    "the photon energy should also be sufficiently larger than the online energy threshold ; since the threshold had been applied to the analog - sum signals separately for the upstream and downstream ends ( section  [ sec - trigger ] ) , the threshold level depended on the @xmath41 position of the shower in the bl .",
    "thus the photon energy was required to be greater than 23 ( 66 ) mev for the showers located at the edge ( center ) of the bl .    in order to remove the events with the photon due to bremsstrahlung of the @xmath54 track from the @xmath48 or @xmath50 decay within the rs , we calculated the angle between the direction of the hit position of the charged track at the rs t - counter from the center of the detector system and the direction of each of the photons from the kaon decay vertex position .",
    "the minimum of the angles should be larger than @xmath58 (  @xmath54 bremsstrahlung \" cut ) .",
    "an extra photon could disappear through inefficiency due to very narrow gaps between counters or inactive material .",
    "tight photon - detection requirements , the  photon veto \" cuts , were imposed on the detector subsystems ; hits in coincidence with the track time within a few nsec and with the energy above a threshold of typically 1 mev were identified as the activity due to an extra photon .",
    "the photon veto cuts also ensured that only those events in which the total photon energy from the @xmath36 decay was deposited in the bl ( and a part of the showers was not recorded in any other subsystem ) were accepted .",
    "an extra photon could also go undetected when two electromagnetic showers in the bl overlapped each other and were reconstructed as a single cluster (  fused cluster \" ) . in the monte carlo studies of @xmath52 , it was confirmed that the case with the overlap of two photons originated from the same @xmath29 was negligible ; thus the other case , with the overlap of two photons from different @xmath29 s (  odd combination \" ) , should be considered .",
    "we designed two variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 , described below , in which the fused cluster from @xmath52 was characterized .",
    "suppose that one of the three reconstructed photons @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , e.g. @xmath61 , was the fused cluster and consisted of two photons @xmath64 and @xmath65 with the same azimuthal and polar angles and with the energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 was a parameter that varied from 0 to @xmath69 . a pair of invariant masses @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the nominal mass of @xmath29 , were calculated as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath74 should be small when @xmath68 agreed with the correct value .",
    "in the same way , @xmath75 and @xmath76 were calculated supposing that @xmath62 and @xmath63 were the fused cluster , respectively . finally , the minimum of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 with all the possible values of @xmath68 in each hypothesis , called @xmath59 in this analysis , was obtained .",

    "the invariant masses of two out of the three reconstructed photons : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 were calculated , and the minimum of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , called @xmath60 in this analysis , was obtained .",
    "if an event was from @xmath52 with odd combination , the invariant mass of other two photons should not be close to @xmath73 and thereby @xmath60 would be large .",
    "figure  [ fig_chkspz ] shows the @xmath59 vs. @xmath60 plots for the @xmath8 events and the @xmath52 background events ( after imposing the bl cuts and the photon veto cuts ) generated by the monte carlo simulation . to suppress the background , @xmath59 was required to be more than 30 mev/@xmath83 and @xmath60 was required to be less than 21 mev/@xmath83 .",
    "vs. @xmath60 for the @xmath8 events ( left ) and the @xmath52 background events ( right ) generated by the monte carlo simulation . ]    after imposing the cuts in this subsection , 4553 events survived .",
    "a least - squares fit was used to improve the resolution of the measured @xmath36 quantities .",
    "we assumed just one undetected particle ( neutrino ) in the final state .",
    "the kinematic fit was applied to thirteen observables with three constraints .",
    "the observables were the kinetic energy of the charged particle , the momentum vector of the charged particle , and the momentum vectors of three photons .",
    "the directions of momentum vectors were defined to be from the kaon decay vertex position .",
    "the constraints were :    * the invariant mass of the total energy and momentum should be equal to the nominal mass of @xmath7 , * the kinetic energy and momentum of the charged particle should be consistent with a muon hypothesis , and * the invariant mass of one pair of photons should be equal to @xmath73 .",
    "there are three possible pairings of the three photons to form the @xmath29 ; the combination which minimized the @xmath84 of the global kinematic fit was chosen among the possible event topologies . in simulated @xmath36 decays ,",
