    "one of the exciting new discoveries in solid state physics in the last few years has been the experimental observation of the extrinsic spin hall effect@xcite in gaas heterostructures .",
    "the mechanism of this effect relies on the spin - orbit coupling between the spin of electrons with the perturbing potential of impurities .",
    "another example of similar coupling is the rashba - bytchkov interaction in asymmetrically doped gaas quantum wells containing two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) where the coupled potential comes from the internal electrostatic electric field induced by the structural asymmetry of the well . in modeling both of these situations ,",
    "the atomic potential of the ideal bulk semiconductor enters only through the renormalization of the effective mass and the spin - orbit interaction strength .",
    "interestingly , the rashba - bytchkov interaction has been also suggested as a source of spin hall - like phenomenology@xcite for a clean 2deg . while the effect has been shown to disappear",
    "in extended 2d systems with arbitrarily weak disorder@xcite , it is now known that finite size of the sample in combination with rashba - bytchkov coupling results in the transverse spin current and accumulation of opposite spin densities at the edges of the sample@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that boundaries might directly influence the spin polarization due to the rashba - bytchov coupling either in very wide 2d electronic systems with an edge@xcite or narrow rashba strips@xcite .",
    "however , the physical origin of the latter is quite different from the former : whereas the bulk rashba - bytchkov effect arises from accelerations of electrons in the external electric field , the latter result from the reflection of electrons from the sample s boundary .",
    "motivated by this development , it is natural to explore further alterations of the perfectly periodic bulk potential and its consequences on the spin polarization in the presence of the current .",
    "several authors have considered such a situation in quantum wires with a parabolic confining potential@xcite , wider strips with parabolic@xcite or abrupt@xcite confinement edge .",
    "these alterations in the potential landscape can be also viewed as the `` impurity '' which leads to nonzero spin polarization induced by the flow of the electric current .",
    "recently , experimental evidence of this effect of the in - plane field on spin polarization has been reported@xcite .",
    "further enhancement of this kind of spin - polarization has been suggested using a transport through chaotic quantum dot@xcite or resonant tunable scattering center@xcite .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we have compared the magnitude of the spin polarization induced by the latter mechanism with the one induced by the rashba - bytchkov coupling and scattering of the edge@xcite .",
    "it turns out that for a typical 2deg with an edge , it is about three orders of magnitude larger than the one caused by the edge and the rashba - bytchkov interaction .",
    "this substantial difference is mostly due to the fact that the parameter characterizing spin - orbit coupling appears in second order in the case of the rashba - bytchov - based mechanism@xcite whereas for the edge - induced spin - orbit coupling it comes already in the first order .    in this paper",
    "we consider the edge of the 2deg in si doped gaas quantum well , a system for which the spin hall effect has been experimentally observed .",
    "this allows us to estimate the values of all the parameters entering and we can compare the importance of this edge - effect to the contribution of other mechanisms leading to current - induced spin polarization .",
    "the models considered here are reasonably realistic yet simple enough to be solved almost analytically .",
    "we derive a generally valid simple analytical formula for the induced number of electrons with un - compensated spin per unit length of the edge , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electrical current density in the 2deg , @xmath3 is the parameter giving the strength of the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the effective mass and the charge of electron respectively . noticeably , this result is independent of the density of the 2deg and the details of the edge potential as long as the electrons are confined within the sample .",
    "let us consider a sample with 2deg created within a gaas - based quantum well .",
    "the electrical current in the plane of the 2deg will be driven along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "we will be interested in the physics close to one of the two edges of the sample along which the current flows .",
    "the coordinate in the direction perpendicular to the edge will be @xmath7 , @xmath8 corresponding to the region where the 2deg is present ( see fig .  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "we will describe the electronic states for electrons in the 2deg within the effective mass approximation , treating the electrons as noninteracting quasiparticles .",
    "qualitative changes in our results introduced within a self - consistent mean - field treatment will be studied afterwards .",
    "the length scale characterizing the electrons is given by their fermi wavelength .",
    "it typically attains valuesnm , energy in the effective hartrees , _",
    "ha_@xmath9mev , both numerical values are given for gaas where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the effective mass of the electron and the relative permittivity . ]",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the two - dimensional electronic density and @xmath14 nm is the effective bohr radius in gaas . since this is about two orders of magnitude larger than the inter - atomic distances , we can employ the effective mass theory and approximate the form of the confining potential with a simple functional form .    in our work",
    "will assume that the confining edge potential , @xmath15 , is independent of the coordinate @xmath6 , directed along the edge .",
    "within our analytical derivations we model @xmath15 as an abrupt step of height @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unit step function .",
    "the actual value of the step is much larger than the fermi energy of the 2deg .",
    "this is frequently used to set the potential step to infinity . however , here it is essential that the step is finite as the whole spin - orbit coupling is nonzero only in the region of the nonzero gradient of the confining potential .",
    "since this value should be of the order of the work function of the electrons in the 2deg , we fix this value to @xmath19ev@xmath20ha@xmath21 .",
    "one of the results of our work is the demonstration that the current induced spin polarization is rather independent of this value so that we do not need to be concerned with its precise numerical value , as long as it is large ( @xmath22 ) but finite value .",
    "once we establish the analytical result for this model of abrupt potential step , we will also consider more general forms : step with a linear slope on a distance @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( used in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) , and a partially self - consistent , density - dependent model with a small triangular - shaped dip , @xmath25 , close to the edge . in the absence of this dip ,",
    "the decrease in the density to zero at the edge in the 2deg results in a slight local depletion of electrons there . a small negative value of the depth of the dip , @xmath26 , that is found self - consistently results in a charge neutral edge which is the physically expected situation .    the essential part of our model is the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling term in the electrons hamiltonian . in general , several different types of",
    "so interactions can be similar in magnitude : the rashba - bytchkov , the dresselhaus or the impurity - induced so coupling .",
    "however , since they are all small perturbations to the effective hamiltonian , we can consider them separably and superpose their outcomes in the sense of first order perturbation theory in terms of so parameter appearing in the so interaction . in our paper",
    "we will consider a special case of the impurity - induced so coupling for the special case when the `` impurity '' is the edge potential only .",
    "in general , the so contribution to the hamiltonian takes the form@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath3 characterizes the strength of the so coupling , @xmath28 are pauli matrices , @xmath29 is the operator of electron s momentum and @xmath15 is the effective one - electron potential energy . within our study",
    "the latter corresponds to various models of the edge potential : @xmath30 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "the strength of the so coupling in gaas is known to be approximately @xmath31a@xmath32 which is @xmath33 times larger than the strength of the so coupling in vacuum@xcite .    within the framework of this model",
    "it is very easy to understand the origin of the current - induced spin polarization .",
    "the gradient of the potential energy is directed only in the @xmath7 direction , the momentum is confined only within the @xmath34 plane so that the only nonzero component of the spin operator comes from its @xmath35 component due to the mixed product form in eq .",
    "[ eq - so - vector ] .",
    "specifically , the so interaction is simply a spin - dependent potential @xmath36 with a well defined quantum number for the projection of the spin in the @xmath35 direction , @xmath37 , attaining values @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the @xmath6 component of the electron s momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) . hence , the spin - orbit term is a potential energy which , for states with positive momentum in the @xmath40 direction ( the current ) , is smaller ( larger ) in the spatial region of negative derivative of the edge potential , @xmath41 , for electrons with their spin down ( up ) .",
    "since close to @xmath42 we have @xmath43 , we expect that close to the edge we will find majority of spin - down electrons .",
    "of course , in equilibrium for zero total current density there will be equal number of electron with @xmath44 and @xmath45 so that in this special case zero total spin polarization will be observed .",
    "leads , via the so coupling ( eq .  [ eq - v - so-2d ] ) to attractive potential ( @xmath46 , in green ) for electrons with spin down in the vicinity of the edge .",
    "the initially compensated spins of electrons approaching the edge becomes locally un - compensated due to the difference in the scattering shift @xmath47 . ]",
    "in our previous work  @xcite , we have given estimates for the total induced spin per unit length of the edge using arguments based on wavepacket propagation .",
    "we considered a single - electron wavepacket state , @xmath48 , for a specific momentum in the @xmath6 direction @xmath39 , spin @xmath49 , with momentum @xmath50 of uncertainty @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the reflection amplitude of the eigenstate with energy @xmath54 . for large negative times only the incoming part ( moving from the right in the fig .",

    "for large positive times only the reflected wave will give nonzero contribution . the position and form of the reflected wavepacket",
    "will depend on the spin of the incoming wavepacket since the reflection amplitude , @xmath53 will be different for the two possible spin orientations .",
    "specifically , it is shown in the appendix a that the reflection amplitude has the form @xmath55 where the phase shift up to 3rd order in @xmath3 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 . assuming the width @xmath51 of the wavepacket @xmath48 small",

    "[ eq - phase - shift ] for large times will take a form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , i.e. the maximum of the probability is at @xmath60 . from this",
    "it is evident that the electron with spin down will be lagging behind that with spin up by a distance @xmath61 ( indicated for the reflected right - going wavepackets in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "this behavior of the scattering of single electron in the wavepacket can be directly extended to many - electrons in view of the stroboscopic wavepacket basis@xcite .",
    "namely , the above wavepackets for times @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is arbitrary moment of physical time , form orthogonal set of states which are all occupied with electrons . hence the product of the length @xmath65 times",
