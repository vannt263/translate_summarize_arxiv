    "the nominal p - pb  and pb - pb  luminosities are low enough to keep the number of simultaneous collisions well below one , and one can take their full integrated luminosity as usable for the exclusive measurement . in p - p , pileup is very high and we consider that only 1  fb@xmath60/year can be collected under conditions that preserve the rapidity gaps adjacent to the central @xmath8 system .",

    ". however , the resulting lbyl / cep  @xmath78  1/20 ratio is still too large to make feasible the lbyl observation with proton beams . the situation is more advantageous for p - pb , where the lbyl cross section is only about 6 times smaller than the cep one , obtained scaling by a  =  208 the p - p  cross section at 8.8  tev ( @xmath79  =  16@xmath72  pb ) , multiplied by the square of the pb gluon shadowing , @xmath80  0.7 according to the eps09 nuclear pdf  @xcite .",
    "a final lbyl / cep  @xmath78  1 ratio is reachable applying the aforementioned p@xmath70 and @xmath74 cuts . yet , given the low p - pb  rates expected at the lhc ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) , a 5-@xmath81 observation of lbyl scattering requires an increase of the luminosity from its conservative nominal value  @xcite . + in the pb - pb  case , the situation is more favourable given that parton - mediated exclusive or diffractive cross sections ( which scale as a@xmath14 compared to p - p ) play a comparatively smaller role than in p - p  thanks to the z@xmath82-enhancement of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the pb - pb  cep cross section , as obtained by a@xmath14-scaling the @xmath71  =  13@xmath83  pb cross section in p - p  at 5.5  tev , multiplied by @xmath84  0.25 , is comparable to @xmath49 . adding a simple p@xmath85  0.2  gev condition , reduces the cep background by @xmath8695% without removing any signal event , resulting in a final lbyl / cep  @xmath78  10 ratio .",
