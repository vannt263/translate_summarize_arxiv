    "the celebrated navier  stokes system for homogeneous incompressible newtonian fluids in the vorticity  streamfunction formulation in two dimensions takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the vorticity , @xmath4 is the streamfunction , and @xmath5 represents ( given ) external forcing . for simplicity",
    "we will assume periodic boundary condition , i.e. , the domain is a two dimensional torus @xmath6 , and that all functions have mean zero over the torus .",
    "it is well - known that two dimensional incompressible flows could be extremely complicated with possible chaos and turbulent behavior @xcite .",
    "although some of the features of this turbulent or chaotic behavior may be deduced via analytic means , it is widely believed that numerical methods are indispensable for obtaining a better understanding of these complicated phenomena . for analytic forcing",
    ", it is known that the solution is analytic in space ( in fact gevrey class regular @xcite ) , and hence fourier spectral is the obvious choice for spatial discretization . as for time discretization , one of the popular schemes @xcite is the following semi - implicit algorithm , which treats the viscous term implicitly and the nonlinear advection term explicitly    @xmath7    ere @xmath8 is the time step , and @xmath9 are the approximations of the vorticity at the discrete times @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the convergence of this scheme on any fixed time interval is standard and well - known @xcite .",
    "there are many off - the - shelf efficient solvers of ( [ scheme ] ) , since it essentially reduces to a poisson solver at each time step .",
    "it is also well - known that the nse ( [ nse ] ) is long time enstrophy stable in the sense that the enstrophy @xmath11 is bounded uniformly in time , and it possesses a global attractor @xmath12 and invariant measures @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is the long time dynamics characterized by the global attractor and invariant measure that are central to the understanding of turbulence . therefore a natural question is if numerical schemes such as ( [ scheme ] ) can capture the long time dynamics of the nse ( [ nse ] ) in the sense of convergence of global attractors and invariant measures .",
    "to say the least , we would require that the scheme inherit the long time stability of the nse .",
    "there is a long list of works on time discretization of the nse and related dissipative systems that preserve the dissipativity in various forms @xcite .",
    "it has also been discovered recently that if the dissipativity of a dissipative system is preserved appropriately , then the numerical scheme would be able to capture the long time statistical property of the underlying dissipative system asymptotically , in the sense that the invariant measures of the scheme would converge to those of the continuous - in - time system @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this manuscript is to show that the classical scheme ( [ scheme ] ) is long time stable in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and that the global attractor as well as the invariant measures of the scheme , converge to those of the nse at vanishing time step .",
    "we first recall the well - known periodic sobolev spaces on @xmath13 with average zero : @xmath14 @xmath15 is defined as the dual space of @xmath16 with the duality induced by the @xmath0 inner product .",
    "the adoption of @xmath16 is well - known @xcite since this space is invariant under the navier  stokes dynamics ( [ nse ] ) , provided that the initial data and the forcing term belong to the same space .",

    "now we derive the long time stability of the scheme ( [ scheme ] ) both in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 .",
    "our proof relies on a wente type estimate on the nonlinear term ( see appendix  [ s : wente ] ) , which may be of independent interest .",
    "we first show that the scheme ( [ scheme ] ) is uniformly bounded in @xmath0 , provided that the time step is sufficiently small . to this end , we take the scalar product of ( [ scheme ] ) with @xmath24 and using the relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the @xmath0 norm , we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 the last equality obtaining upon integration by parts . using the cauchy  schwarz and the poincar inequalities , we majorize the right - hand side of ( [ 1 ] ) by @xmath29 using the wente type estimate ( [ q : wente2 ] ) , we bound the nonlinear term as @xmath30 relations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) imply @xmath31 here and in what follows , @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote generic constants whose value may not be the same each time they appear .",

    "in addition , the nonlinear term in ( [ est - coll - l2 - 6 - 2 ] ) can be controlled in a similar way : @xmath287 with a discrete sobolev imbedding inequality applied in the second step .",
    "therefore , a substitution of ( [ est - coll - l2 - 6 - 9])([est - coll - l2 - 6 - 10 ] ) into ( [ est - coll - l2 - 4 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - l2 - 5 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - l2 - 6 - 1])([est - coll - l2 - 6 - 2 ] ) results in @xmath288 its combination with ( [ est - coll - l2 - 2 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - l2 - 4 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - l2 - 5 ] ) and ( [ est - coll - l2 - 1 ] ) leads to @xmath289 under a constraint for the time step @xmath290 we arrive at @xmath291 with @xmath292 . furthermore , an application of the poincar inequality ( [ est - coll - l2 - 3 ] ) implies that @xmath293 applying an induction argument to the above estimate yields @xmath294 note that @xmath295 is a time dependent value ; however , its time dependence is in exponential decay so that a global in time bound is available .",
    "in addition , we also have the @xmath296 bound for the numerical solution : @xmath297    however , it is observed that the a - priori estimate ( [ est - coll - l2 - 11 ] ) is not sufficient to bound the @xmath257 norm ( [ est - coll - a priori ] ) of the vorticity field . in turn , we perform a higher order energy estimate @xmath298 for the numerical solution of the vorticity field .      taking the inner product of ( [ scheme - coll-1st-1 ] ) with @xmath300",
    "gives @xmath301 the cauchy inequality can be applied to bound the outer force term : @xmath302 for the nonlinear terms , we first make the following decomposition : @xmath303 for the first term , the a - priori assumption ( [ est - coll - a priori ] ) gives @xmath304 in which we applied the discrete sobolev inequality in 2-d : @xmath305 .",
    "this in turn leads to @xmath306 the conservative nonlinear term @xmath307 can be analyzed as in ( [ est - coll - l2 - 6 - 3])([est - coll - l2 - 6 - 10 ] ) : @xmath308 with the help of the elliptic regularity ( [ est - coll - prelim-1 ] ) , poincar s inequality and 2-d sobolev embedding .",
    "consequently , we see that the first part of the nonlinear term ( [ est - coll - h1 - 3 - 2 ] ) has the same bound as ( [ est - coll - h1 - 4 ] ) : @xmath309 which in turn leads to an estimate similar to ( [ est - coll - h1 - 5 ] ) : @xmath310    for the second term in ( [ est - coll - h1 - 3 - 1 ] ) , we start with the following sobolev inequality : @xmath311 in which an elliptic regularity @xmath312 was utilized in the second step and the leading @xmath0 estimate ( [ est - coll - l2 - 11 ] ) was used in the last step .",
    "similarly , we also observe that the kinematic relationships @xmath313 indicate the following sobolev estimates : @xmath314 in which estimate ( [ est - coll - l2 - 11 ] ) was used in the last step .",
    "consequently , a combination of ( [ est - coll - h1 - 6 ] ) and ( [ est - coll - h1 - 8 ] ) indicates that @xmath315 due to the fact that @xmath316 . in turn , the following estimate is obtained @xmath317 meanwhile , the second conservative nonlinear term in ( [ est - coll - h1 - 3 - 2 ] ) , @xmath318 , can be expanded and analyzed in a similar way : @xmath319 again , the elliptic regularity ( [ est - coll - prelim-1 ] ) , poincar s inequality and 2-d sobolev embedding were repeatedly used in the analysis . as a result , its combination with ( [ est - coll - h1 - 10 ] ) leads to @xmath320 we can always choose @xmath321 , so that an application of young s inequality ( @xmath322 with @xmath323 ) gives @xmath324 furthermore , since @xmath325 , we can apply young s inequality to @xmath326 and obtain @xmath327 in which @xmath328 depends on @xmath295 , @xmath329 , @xmath330 and @xmath331 . as a result , substituting ( [ est - coll - h1 - 11])([est - coll - h1 - 12 ] ) into ( [ est - coll - h1 - 10 ] )",
    "gives an estimate for the second nonlinear term : @xmath332 with @xmath333    the third nonlinear term in ( [ est - coll - h1 - 3 - 1 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - h1 - 3 - 2 ] ) can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "we first look at @xmath334 . a bound for @xmath335",
    "can be obtained in the same fashion as ( [ est - coll - h1 - 8 ] ) : @xmath336 its combination with ( [ est - coll - h1 - 6 ] ) shows that @xmath337 this analysis can be applied to the term @xmath338 in the same way : @xmath339 as a result , we arrive at the following estimate : @xmath340 again , since @xmath341 , we can apply young s inequality and obtain @xmath342 in which @xmath343 depends on @xmath295 , @xmath344 and @xmath331 .",
    "going back to ( [ est - coll - h1 - 15 - 5 ] ) , we have an estimate for the third nonlinear term : @xmath345 with @xmath346 .",
    "finally , a combination of ( [ est - coll - h1 - 1])([est - coll - h1 - 3 - 2 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - h1 - 5 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - h1 - 5 - 2 ] ) , ( [ est - coll - h1 - 13 ] ) and ( [ est - coll - h1 - 17 ] ) results in @xmath347 under a constraint similar to ( [ constraint - coll - dt-1 ] ) and a trivial constraint @xmath348 for the time step : @xmath349 we have @xmath350 furthermore , an application of elliptic regularity @xmath351 implies that @xmath352 applying an induction argument to the above estimate yields @xmath353 again , @xmath354 is a time dependent value ; however , its time dependence is in exponential decay so that a global in time bound is available .",
    "in addition , we also have the @xmath355 bound for the numerical solution : @xmath356      with the @xmath357 and @xmath358 estimate for the numerical vorticity solution , namely ( [ est - coll - l2 - 11 ] ) and ( [ est - coll - h1 - 21 ] ) , we are able to recover the @xmath257 assumption ( [ est - coll - a priori ] ) : @xmath359 for simplicity , by taking @xmath360 , we see that ( [ est - coll - a priori ] ) is also valid at time step @xmath262 if we set @xmath361 note that @xmath295 and @xmath354 are independent of @xmath258 in the derivation .",
    "the constant @xmath258 is only used in the time step constraint ( [ constraint - coll - dt-1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , an induction can be applied so that the a - priori @xmath257 assumption ( [ est - coll - a priori ] ) is valid at any time step under a global time step constraint @xmath362 again , note that both @xmath295 and @xmath354 contain an exponential decay in time and therefore are bounded by a given constant in time .    in other words , under ( [ a priori - coll-3 ] ) , a global in time constant constraint for the time step , the proposed semi - implicit scheme ( [ scheme - coll-1st-1])([scheme - coll-1st-3 ] ) is unconditionally stable ( in terms of spatial grid size and final time ) .",
    "in addition , an asymptotic decay for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 norm for the vorticity ( equivalent to @xmath1 and @xmath363 norms for the velocity ) can be derived .",
    "lemma  [ collocation ] is proven .",
