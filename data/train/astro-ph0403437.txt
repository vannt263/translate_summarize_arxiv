    "our results allow the testing of the prediction of @xcite on the alignment of the spin axes of pulsars with their proper motion vector .",
    "the spin axis can be derived from the high resolution images from chandra .",
    "these allow the symmetry , and thus presumably the spin , axes to be directly discerned .",
    "only two cases have been accurately tested so far , the crab ( @xcite ) and vela . the extra accuracy we can provide refines the conclusion reached by pavlov et al ( 2000 ) and helfand et al ( 2001 ) for the vela alignment .",
    "if the model of @xcite is correct any misalignment of the axes allows the us to estimate the timescale of the impulse in terms of the initial rotation period , a value of great importance to understanding the core collapse .",
    "the rotations of the pulsar average out the off - axis acceleration of the pulsar , bringing the proper motion and the spin axis into alignment .",
    "the data , and its reduction are full described in dodson et al ( 2003 ) we find a pulsar position of @xmath1 , @xmath2 for a reference epoch of 2000.0 .",
    "the proper motion is @xmath3 @xmath4  and a parallax of @xmath5 mas , or @xmath6 pc .",
    "two corrections need to be applied to our results to calculate the motion of the vela pulsar in its local environment .",
    "our observations are directly tied to the icrf , therefore the solar peculiar motion and the galactic rotation contribute to the observed proper motion , and need to be removed .",
    "the dominant source of error is from the uncertainties in the solar peculiar motion parameters .",
    "we have used the measured uncertainties in our observations and combined those with the models .",
    "this gives us an angular motion , at vela s local standard of rest , of @xmath7 @xmath4 , @xmath8 @xmath4  or @xmath9",
    "@xmath4  at a position angle of @xmath10 .",
    "the pulsars transverse space velocity is therefore @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the pa does not lie exactly along the spin axis ( e.g. @xmath13 ( helfand et al 2001 ) , or @xmath14 ( pavlov et al 2001 ) ) , which implies that the impulse timescale was not quite long enough to average the off - axis component to zero .",
    "recent communications with caraveo _",
    "et al _ has found that the published hst position angle ( caraveo etal 2001 ) has an arithmetic error and is in fact @xmath15 , in excellent agreement with our own result .",
    "thus we consider the implications of this offset .",
    "firstly if the impulse is equal along and across the spin axis , i.e. at @xmath16 , after only two rotations it is no longer possible to achieve an offset of @xmath0 . if the acceleration vector was at @xmath17 to the spin axis it is still possible to generate such an offset until the seventh rotation .",
    "this limits either the initial rotation period , or the timescale of the sn event .",
    "we have measured the proper motion and parallax of the vela pulsar to an unprecedented accuracy ( @xmath18 @xmath4  , @xmath19 mas ) , and have been able to convert these back to the space velocity and position angle of the pulsar in its local environment with greater precision that previously possible ( @xmath11 @xmath12at @xmath20 ) , because of the unambiguity in the radio reference frame .",
    "this allows the precise comparison of the vela x - ray nebula symmetry axis and the proper motion of the vela pulsar , opening insights into the timescale of the core collapse processes .",
    "we estimate that the collapse must have taken less than seven rotations to occur ."
