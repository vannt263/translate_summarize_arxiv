    "[ sec : db ] , we will review the dynamical @xmath0-brane solutions , which have dilaton coupling constants with the same value as static @xmath0-brane backgrounds @xcite .",
    "this is a good illustration to describe @xmath0-branes in an expanding universe and also an important example to see the naked singularity of a particular type .",
    "these singularities also appear in a variety of d@xmath0-brane configurations of string theory .",

    "we verify that the dynamical @xmath0-brane backgrounds generically possess a timelike curvature singularity whose location is far away from the origin of the @xmath0-brane .",

    "we will discuss that the presence of a @xmath0-brane drastically changes the causal structure of the dynamical solution .",

    "there is a possibility of smearing out some dimensions of y space .",
    "the function @xmath26 in ( [ pv : h1:eq ] ) can be expressed as @xcite where @xmath27 is the smeared dimensions in y space .",
    "now we will study the spacetime structure of the dynamical @xmath0-brane backgrounds . the scalar curvature of the metric ( [ p : metric : eq ] )",
    "becomes where the function @xmath28 is given by ( [ pv : warp : eq ] ) . since the ricci scalar diverges at @xmath29 , there are curvature singularities at these spacetime points .",
    "the singularity is timelike and its effects can propagate into the background spacetime .",
    "the naked singularity thus appears at @xmath30 , and moves in toward @xmath31 , in the @xmath0-brane background ( [ p : ansatz : eq ] ) . setting @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , the region of regular spacetime eventually splits , and surrounds each of the @xmath0-branes separately as @xmath34 increases .",

    "although the former appears in the static @xmath0-brane solution as well as dynamical one , the latter is the singularities caused by the gravitational collapse in the dynamical @xmath0-brane background .",
    "first we comment about causal structure and a curvature singularity at @xmath36 .",

    "although the singularity at @xmath36 is not hidden by an event horizon , this will be removed in the non - extremal solution @xcite , or string theory @xcite .",
    "hence , the curvature singularity at @xmath36 is not so physically significant because of the expectation of the singularity resolutions . in this paper",
    ", we will set the `` regular and smooth '' initial data and focus on the behavior of curvature singularities at @xmath29 , even if the initial data at @xmath36 describes a singularity . here",

    "the `` regular and smooth '' initial data in the dynamical @xmath0-brane background ( [ p : metric : eq ] ) evolves into a spacetime with a naked singularity .",
    "if the dilaton is trivial or vanishing , we can find the horizon at @xmath36 for the dynamical brane solution @xcite .",
    "for example , we obtain a black hole geometry for d3-brane , m - brane system in the ten- , or eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "although the near horizon geometries of these black holes in the expanding universe are the same as the static solutions , the asymptotic structures are completely different , giving the flrw universe with scale factors same as the universe filled by stiff matter @xcite . in this case , we will be able to set a perfectly smooth initial data .",

    "let us study the null geodesic in order to discuss the property of the singularity in the dynamical @xmath0-brane background ( [ pv : warp : eq ] ) .",
    "we set the constant vector @xmath37 after rotating the spatial part of worldvolume coordinates on @xmath38constant surface .",
    "if we boost in the @xmath39-direction , then the function @xmath40 depends on the coordinate of ( i ) time  ( @xmath41 ) , ( ii ) null  ( @xmath42 ) , ( iii ) spatial part of worldvolume  ( @xmath43 ) . in the following ,",
    "we will discuss two cases ( i ) in sec .",

    "it is useful to comment about the killing symmetries of the solution .",

    "since the killing vectors @xmath47 of the dynamical @xmath0-brane background satisfy @xmath48 , there are only @xmath0 independent vectors for @xmath49 .",
    "now we discuss the causal structure of a dynamical @xmath0-brane background where the function @xmath40 depends only on the time .",
    "the solution can be expressed as where we assume @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , are the metrics of @xmath16-dimensional minkowski spacetime , @xmath54-dimensional sphere , respectively , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath23 are constant parameters , and the constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 are given by ( [ p : parameter : eq ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath23 can always be removed by shifting time as @xmath57 , up to the redefinition of @xmath34 .",
    "so , we will set @xmath58 henceforth .",
    "we discuss that future null geodesics arrive at the singularity in the finite affine parameter @xmath59 .",
    "now we consider the null geodesics with @xmath60 , where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to an affine parameter .",
    "then the geodesics in the @xmath1-dimensional spacetime ( [ g : metric : eq ] ) have to obey where the @xmath61 denotes for future , past directed outgoing null geodesics , respectively .",
    "the geodesic equations for @xmath34 and @xmath62 give    since it is not easy to solve analytically , we first discuss the radial null geodesics without @xmath0-brane .",
    "it turns out that the collapsing universe ( [ ge : bg : eq ] ) does not create any naked singularities .",
    "when @xmath63 , the metric ( [ ge : bg : eq ] ) becomes if we define a new coordinate the metric now takes the form where the metric @xmath64 is the spatial part of the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski metric @xmath15 .",
    "since this is simply a collapsing or an expanding flrw universe , there is curvature singularity at @xmath65 .",
    "we next consider the time evolution of universe near the singularity .",
    "the behavior of singularity can be analyzed by recalling that the solution of null geodesic equation for @xmath63 case .    from ( [ ge : ge - t : eq ] )",
    ", we find where the parameter @xmath66 satisfies the inequality @xmath67 because of @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "then we find where @xmath70 denote constants , and @xmath71 is defined by by eq .",
    "( [ ge : t0:eq ] ) , the null geodesics hit the curvature singularity at @xmath72 in finite affine parameter .",
    "hence , the background geometry is geodesically incomplete .",
    "the solution of radial null geodesic equation can be also expressed as where @xmath70 is given in ( [ ge : t0:eq ] ) , @xmath73 is constant , and @xmath71 is defined by ( [ ge : beta : eq ] ) .",

    "[ fig : p ] .",
    "the angular coordinates on @xmath74 and also @xmath0-dimensional worldvolume coordinates have been suppressed .",
    "the spacetime is geodesically incomplete , since radial null geodesics reach singularities at a finite affine parameter value .",
    "although there is a curvature singularity at @xmath72 , the singularity in this solution is spacelike .",
    "one way to see this is to note that outgoing radial light rays satisfy ( [ ge : r1:eq ] ) , so that as @xmath75 , @xmath62 approaches @xmath73 , as @xmath76 .",
    "finally we calculate the radial null geodesics numerically in a dynamical @xmath0-brane background with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we show the motion of radial null geodesics for a 1-brane ( fig [ fig : p=1 ] ) , 2-brane ( fig [ fig : p=2 ] ) , 3-brane ( fig [ fig : p=3 ] ) , and m5-brane ( fig [ fig : p=5 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the left panels ( a ) in figs .  [ fig : p=1 ] - [ fig : p=5 ] show that past directed null geodesics reach the naked singularity in finite affine parameter .",
    "the `` nonsingular '' initial data evolves into a timelike singularity .",
    "since we can set a `` regular and smooth '' initial data for the m5-brane , this leads to be a violation of cosmic censorship . on the other hand",

    "[ fig : tp ] .",
    "although the red ( dotted ) curve hits the naked singularity in finite affine parameter , the orange ( bold ) line can avoid the singularity .",

    "the null geodesics outside of it hit the timelike singularity while the past directed radial null geodesics inside of this hypersurface can reach past null infinity .",
    "there is a cauchy horizon ( dot - dash line ) in the dynamical @xmath0-brane solution ( [ ge : bg : eq ] ) . in the domain @xmath80(s ) which is inside of a cauchy horizon h@xmath81(s ) , the null geodesics can pass through the initial surface s and evolves far into the past infinitely .",
    "we will see that the @xmath0-brane background changes the causal structure of the dynamical solution without @xmath0-brane .",
    "when one adds a single @xmath0-brane , the spacelike singularity is replaced by a timelike one which is visible to observers in the spacetime .",
