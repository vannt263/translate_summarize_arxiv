    "during the nucleate boiling , separate gas bubbles form at the heater surface .",
    "the liquid phase of the fluid is thus in the direct contact with the heater and the heat transfer rate is very large .",
    "this feature explains the high technological importance of boiling in the applications where the high rate cooling of the heater surface is required .",
    "besides the nucleate boiling , another regime of boiling exists : film boiling . during the film boiling",
    ", the heater is covered by a quasi - continuous gas film .",
    "this film thermally insulates the heater from the liquid and the heat transfer rate is much smaller than in nucleate boiling regime .",
    "the transition from nucleate to film boiling thus causes a sharp loss of the heat transfer and the heater can melt down if the heating power is not controlled .",
    "this transition is called  boiling crisis \" ( bc ) , or  chf phenomenon \" since it occurs when the heat flux @xmath0 from the heater attains a threshold value @xmath1 called  critical heat flux \" ( chf ) @xcite . in spite of the considerable amount of studies devoted to this important phenomenon ,",
    "its mechanism is not well understood .",
    "this difficulty originates from the violence of the fluid motion during the conventional boiling that on the one hand conceals the mechanisms of bubble growth from detailed observation , and on the other hand hugely complicates direct numerical simulations .",
    "most still unanswered questions concern close vicinity of the heating surface , down to the scale of the foot of a bubble growing at the surface of the heater .",
    "the recent revival of the interest to the microgravity boiling in general and to bc in particular is related to the development of the engine @xcite of the upper stage of ariane 5 launcher that will need to be restarted under microgravity conditions .",
    "the boiling can be very different since it is dependent on many parameters like system pressure , presence of the externally imposed fluid flow , temperature in the fluid bulk that can be at saturation or below , thermophysical properties of the fluid and the heater etc . in all cases ,",
    "bc begins in a very thin fluid layer ( adjacent to the heater ) , the thickness of which is small in comparison with the bubble size .",
    "the phenomena at this scale  feel \" only the averaged values of macroscopic flow variables and thus do not depend on details of the flow regime which should not thus change the bc mechanism .",
    "however the contribution of the microscale hydrodynamic motion ( that can change in magnitude with the system pressure , see below ) to the bc triggering is still unclear .    for the reasons of industrial importance",
    ", boiling is mostly studied at low pressures comparing to the critical pressure @xmath2 ( the pressure of the gas - liquid critical point ) of the fluid under study , e.g. for water or freon at atmospheric pressure .",
    "@xmath1 is then large ( of the order of several mw / m@xmath3 for water ) and the boiling close to it is indeed extremely violent .",
    "however , it is well known @xcite that @xmath1 decreases at high pressures where bc can thus be observed at a smaller heat flux .",
    "in addition , the thermal diffusivity is smaller in this regime , the bubble growth slows down , and the optical distortions disappear due to the slowness of the fluid motion . from the point of view of the modelling , this slowness permits to simplify the problem by neglecting the hydrodynamic stresses at the bubble interface , the shape of which can then be calculated in the quasi - static approximation .",
    "several groups @xcite proposed the vapor recoil instability @xcite as a reason for bc .",
    "although they did not make clear why and how this instability can induce the spreading of a dry spot , these authors show that the vapor recoil can be an important factor .",
    "every fluid molecule evaporated from the liquid interface causes a recoil force analogous to that created by the gas emitted by a rocket engine .",
    "it pushes the interface towards the liquid side in the normal direction .",
    "this force appears because the fluid necessarily expands while transforming from liquid to gas phase .",
    "obviously , the stronger the evaporation rate @xmath4 ( mass per time and interface area ) , the larger the vapor recoil force .",
    "the vapor recoil force per unit interface area reads @xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6(@xmath7 ) signifies liquid ( gas ) density .     of the belt on the bubble surface , in which the vapor recoil force is important ,",
    "is exaggerated with respect to the bubble size.,width=226 ]    let us now consider a growing vapor bubble attached to the heater surface ( fig .  [ brec ] ) . while the temperature of the vapor - liquid interface is constant and equal to the saturation temperature for the given system pressure for the pure fluid ( see the discussion in @xcite and references therein ) , a strong temperature gradient forms near the heating surface .",
    "the liquid is overheated in a thermal boundary layer , and the heat flux @xmath8 at the bubble surface is thus elevated in a  belt \" of the bubble surface adjacent to the bubble foot . as a matter of fact , most of the evaporation into the vapor bubble",
    "is produced in this belt , whose thickness @xmath9 is much smaller than the bubble radius . since @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the latent heat , the vapor recoil near the contact line is much larger than at the other part of the bubble surface .",
    "consequently , the bubble should deform as if the triple contact line were pulled apart from the bubble center as shown in fig .",
    "[ brec ] . therefore , under the action of the vapor recoil the dry spot under the vapor bubble should spread so that the bubble will cover the heater surface .",
    "a numerical simulation @xcite of such a process requires solving of coupled thermal conduction ( both in solid and liquid ) and capillary problems .",
    "the capillary problem includes a solution for the bubble shape in the quasi - static approximation in which the local bubble curvature @xmath12 is defined by the modified laplace equation @xmath13 .",
    "the bubble shape can be determined from the function @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ appangle ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 is the constant difference of the pressures in the bubble and in the rest of the fluid and @xmath16 is the surface tension .",
    "@xmath17 and then @xmath12 vary along the interface and attain their maxima near the line of the triple contact liquid - gas - solid .",
    "since curvature is the first derivative of the angle formed by the tangent to the bubble interface and the horizon , the large @xmath12 means that this angle varies strongly near the contact line .",
    "the apparent contact angle @xmath18 measured at some distance from the contact line can thus deviate strongly from its actual value @xmath19 imposed at the contact line , see fig .",
    "[ appangle ] .     and actual @xmath20 contact angles .",
    "the solid circle indicates the contact line , the zero point for the curvilinear coordinate @xmath21 measured along the bubble contour .",
    "the arrows show the directions of the vapor recoil force in the vicinity of the contact line and its vertical component that creates an additional adhesion of the bubble to the heater.,width=321 ]    the time of residence of a vapor bubble on the heater is an important parameter since the bubble might simply depart from the heater before having time to spread .",
    "the determination of the residence time requires the forces acting on the bubble to be analyzed .",
    "such an analysis @xcite shows that the vapor recoil creates an additional adhesion that prevents the bubble departure as soon as the bubble spreading begins , i.e. when the vapor recoil becomes important .",
    "this adhesion force can be obtained by integrating the vertical component @xmath22 of @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ appangle ] ) over the bubble interface .",
    "the thermal problem is extremely delicate since most of heat transfer occurs at a scale @xmath9 much smaller than the bubble size .",
    "extremely fine meshing is thus needed to obtain the correct values of the fluxes near the contact line .",
    "another difficulty appears since the position of one of the solution domain boundaries , that is of the bubble interface , is not known in advance and depends ( trough @xmath17 ) on the solution of the thermal problem itself .",
    "the solution of the full problem thus needs to be found by time - consuming iterations .",
    "c ; @xmath24  mw / m@xmath3.,width=264 ]    the simulated bubble growth is presented in fig .",
    "[ simul ] .",
    "it can be seen that the dry spot is initially very small and remains so during the initial growth stage . at about 180  ms",
    "the dry spot begins to grow suddenly , i.e. the bubble spreads .",
    "such a spreading represents the beginning of formation of the gas film characteristic for bc .",
    "the apparent contact angle grows sharply while @xmath19 is maintained to be zero throughout the simulation .",
    "zero value was chosen because the wetting case is most common .",
    "the effect is even stronger for larger contact angles where the dry spot exists from the very beginning .",
    "[ simul ] also shows the formation of a hot spot at the heater surface in the middle of the dry area .",
    "this temperature rise illustrates the already discussed blocking of the heat transfer by vapor .",
    "to overcome the experimental difficulties encountered during the observations of bc at low pressures , we carry out our experiments at very high pressures , in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "we take advantage of the so - called  critical slowing down \" observed near the critical point . in fact , due to the smallness of the thermal diffusivity , the growing process of a single vapor bubble could be observed during tens of minutes thus allowing for a very detailed analysis .",
    "the chf value is also vanishing at the critical point @xcite so that bc can be examined at a small heat flux @xmath0 that does not necessarily induce a strong fluid motion which might hinder the optical observations .",
    "however , near - critical bubble growth experiments have an important drawback .",
    "since the surface tension becomes very low near the critical point , gravity completely flattens the liquid interface .",
    "weightlessness conditions are thus necessary to preserve the usual convex bubble shape .    in our already performed experiments ,",
    "the cells are closed and only pure fluid is present in them so that its total mass and volume remains constant . unlike the conventional boiling experiments , the gas bubble is not nucleated but exists already before the cell heating begins . the bubble growth is then observed .",
    "another particularity of the near - critical systems consists in the symmetry of the co - existence curve ( temperature dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) with respect to the critical density @xmath25 : @xmath26 . when the average cell density is equal to @xmath25 , the gas volume remains constant and equal to one half of the cell volume throughout the heating",
    ". the gas mass however increases ( and the liquid mass decreases ) during the heating because of the density change .",
    "this makes the optical observations even more convenient .    .",
    "the zero value of the actual contact angle is imposed while the apparent contact angle attains a large value.,width=302 ]    two series of experiments were carried out up to now .",
    "the first @xcite used sf@xmath27 fluid on board of the mir space station in the alice-2 apparatus designed by the french cnes agency .",
    "the choice of sf@xmath27 is made for practical reasons : the critical point of this fluid is @xmath28c , @xmath29  bar and requires much less severe conditions for the experiment than for example water ( @xmath30c , 220  bar ) .",
    "some of the results of this experiment are presented in fig .",
    "[ cell_exp - theor]a .",
    "the sequential photos of the growing vapor bubble are taken through the transparent bases of the cylindrical cell , the lateral copper walls of which are being heated .",
    "spreading of the dry spot under the bubble similar to that in fig .",
    "[ simul ] can be seen .",
    "the bubble shapes calculated for different values of the vapor recoil strength @xmath31 ( where the integration is performed along the bubble contour ) are presented for comparison in fig .",
    "[ cell_exp - theor]b .",
    "only the capillary problem was solved using @xmath32 as a boundary condition .",
    "the @xmath33 expression used was that of @xcite .    however , the cells in alice-2 were not suitable to control the heat supply or to measure it",
    ". it did not permit to change the bubble position with respect to the cell either .",
    "these limitations have been overcome in the experimental h@xmath34 setup that makes use of the magnetic levitation facility @xcite at cea - grenoble .",
    "a cylindrical cell of 8  mm diameter and 5  mm height is filled with h@xmath34 at critical density .",
    "the sapphire transparent bases of the cell are good heat conductors in the cryogenic temperature range ( @xmath35k for h@xmath34 ) .",
    "the lateral cell wall is made of stainless steel which is on the contrary the thermal insulator .",
    "the fluid is heated by one of the windows while the temperature of the other is maintained by the temperature regulation system which permits us to measure the heat flux removed from the cell .",
    "the earth gravity is compensated by magnetic forces within 2% in the cell volume .",
    "the position of the cell with respect to the magnetic field is chosen so that the residual force positions the bubble against the heating window .",
    "the growth of the dry spot can thus be directly observed and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dry_spot ] .",
    "small vapor bubbles grow and depart from the heater under the action of the residual magnetic forces .",
    "the bubble spreading begins however for the unique ( largest ) vapor bubble .",
    "one can see that the same mechanism of the dry spot spreading works also relatively far from the critical point .",
    "indeed , the experiments were performed for up to 3% deviation from @xmath2 .",
    "this paper deals with the vapor recoil model which describes the triggering of the boiling crisis .",
    "the results of both simulations and experiments in low gravity confirm this model .",
    "however , further studies are necessary",
    ". the simulations of the bubble departure under the influence of gravity or / and externally imposed flow should be performed to determine @xmath1 , the heat flux necessary to trigger the boiling crisis .",
    "this is a complex problem because of two reasons .",
    "first , the heat transfer singularity at the contact line needs to be resolved .",
    "second , the bubble surface position ( including the contact line ) needs to be determined rigorously , without employing any hypotheses on the interface shape like  liquid microlayer \" hypothesis used conventionally @xcite to describe the contact line heat transfer .",
    "the experiments are also needed to be carried on .",
    "the drop spreading will be studied quantitatively , both under magnetic levitation and in microgravity on board of the international space station in the cnes declic apparatus .",
