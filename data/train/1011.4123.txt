    ". these conditions can be satisfied for a superfluid at zero temperature where only the super fluid component exists , but a sharper description is with the dimensionless ratios @xmath0 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , the entropy density , vanishes for the superfluid component as well .  while @xmath11 can still be zero for scaling invariant systems , the situation for @xmath0 is more subtle .",
    "in general , stronger interactions implies a smaller @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a perfect fluid with the smallest @xmath0 is likely to be strongly interacting which requires non - perturbative tools to compute it .",
    "the anti - de - sitter space / conformal field theory correspondence ( ads / cft ) maldacena:1997re , gubser:1998bc , witten:1998qj allows the @xmath0  of strongly interacting cft s to be computed in weakly interaction gravitational theories .",
    "a universal number @xmath14 is found for every cft with a gravity dual in the large @xmath15 , with @xmath15 the size of the gauge group , and infinite thooft coupling limit buchel:2003tz , kovtun:2004de , buchel:2004qq . with this result , together with the connection to the uncertainty principle through the relation @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the mean energy and life time of quasiparticles , kovtun , son , and starinets  ( kss ) kovtun:2004de conjectured that the strongly interacting cft value @xmath19 is the minimum bound for @xmath0  for all physical systems .",
    "theoretically , there are several attempts to evade this bound .",
    "it is found that @xmath0 can be as small as possible ( but still non - negative ) in a carefully engineered meson system @xcite , although the system is meta - stable .",
    "also , in strongly interacting cfts , @xmath20 corrections can be negative @xcite  and can modify the @xmath0 bound slightly @xcite .    experimentally , there are intensive interests to find the most perfect fluid ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the smallest @xmath21 known so far is realized in a system of hot and dense matter thought to be quark gluon plasma just above the phase transition temperature produced at rhic @xcite with @xmath22 luzum:2008cw .",
    "a robust upper limit @xmath23 was extracted by another group @xcite and a lattice computation of gluon plasma yields @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "progress has been made in cold unitary fermi gases as well .",
    "an analysis of the damping of collective oscillations gives @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "even smaller values of @xmath0 are indicated by recent data on the expansion of rotating clouds @xcite but more careful analyses are needed @xcite .",
    "even if the @xmath26 bound for @xmath0 turns out to be invalid , it is still interesting to use it as a bench mark value for the perfectness of fluids .",
    "it was found that based on the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) analysis of arnold , moore and yaffe ( amy ) @xcite , the measured @xmath0 at rhic can not be explained by pqcd ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly interacting qgp picture is very different from the conventional picture of weakly interacting qgp  and is considered as one of the most surprising discoveries at the rhic .",
    "however , a recent perturbative qcd calculation  of @xmath0 of a gluon plasma by xu and greiner ( xg ) @xcite shows that the dominant contribution comes from the inelastic @xmath2 ( 23 ) process instead of the elastic @xmath27  ( 22 ) process .",
    "in particular , the 23 process is 7 times more important than 22 .",
    "thus , @xmath28 can be achieved when the strong coupling constant @xmath29 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , xg and their collaborators improve their calculation using the kubo relation and give smaller contribution from the 23 process : about 5 times ( 2@xmath309 times ) the 22 process .",
    "thus , the conventional weakly interacting qgp could still be valid .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to amy s result where the 23 process only gives @xmath31 correction to the 22 process .",
    "both xg and amy  use kinetic theory for their calculations .",
    "the main differences are ( i ) xg uses a parton cascade model @xcite to solve the boltzmann equation and , for technical reasons , gluons are treated as a classical gas instead of a bosonic gas . on the other hand , amy solves the boltzmann equation for a bosonic gas .",
    "( ii ) amy approximates the @xmath32 processes , @xmath33 , by the @xmath34 splitting in the collinear limit where the two gluon splitting angle is higher order .",
    "xg uses the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit where one of the gluon momenta in the final state of @xmath35 is soft but it can have a large splitting angle with its mother gluon .    in an earlier attempt to resolve the discrepancy between xg s and",
    "amy s results @xcite , a boltzmann equation computation of @xmath13 is carried out without taking the classical gluon approximation ( like amy s approach ) but the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit is applied to the 23 matrix element ( like xg s approach , modulo a factor 2 in the 23 matrix element squared ; see @xcite for details ) . it was found that the classical gas approximation does not cause a significant error in @xmath0 ( although the individual errors on @xmath13 and @xmath12 are larger ) .",
    "however , the result is sensitive to whether the soft gluon bremsstrahlung limit is imposed on the phase space or not . if this limit is imposed , the result is closer to amy s ; if not , the result is closer to xg s .",
    "this raises the concern whether this approximation is good for computing @xmath13 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to settle this issue by removing both the soft gluon bremsstrahlung approximation and the collinear approximation to the 23 process .",
    "the leading order [ @xmath36 contribution to @xmath13 only involves the 22 and 23 processes @xcite ( the power counting for 22 , 23 and other processes are reproduced in @xcite ) . in this paper , the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) treatment",
    "is used for the 22 matrix element , while the exact matrix element in vacuum is supplemented by the gluon debye mass insertion for the 23 process .",
    "also , the debye mass is used for the external gluon mass in the kinetic theory as well .",
    "the errors from not implementing htl and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in the 23 process , and from the uncalculated higher order corrections , are also estimated .",

    "we will try to estimate the error from neglecting the lpm effect .",
    "an intuitive explanation of this effect was given in ref .",
    "gyulassy:1991xb : for the soft bremsstrahlung gluon with transverse momentum @xmath209 , the mother gluon has a transverse momentum uncertainty @xmath210 and a size uncertainty @xmath211 .",
    "it takes the bremsstrahlung gluon the formation time @xmath212 to fly far enough from the mother gluon to be resolved as a radiation .",
    "but if the formation time is longer than the mean free path @xmath213 , then the radiation is incomplete and it would be resolved as @xmath27 instead of @xmath214 .",
    "thus , the resolution scale is set by @xmath215 .",
    "this yields an ir cut - off @xmath216 on the phase space @xcite .",
    "thus , the lpm effect reduces the 23 collision rate and will increase @xmath188 .",
    "our previous calculation using the gunion - bertsch formula shows that implementing the @xmath99regulator gives a very close result to the lpm effect @xcite .",
    "thus , we will estimate the size of the lpm effect by increasing the external gluon mass @xmath104 from @xmath91 to @xmath99 .",
    "\\(c ) higher order effect .",
    "the higher order effect is parametrically suppressed by @xmath217 , but the size is unknown . computing this effect requires a treatment beyond the boltzmann equation hidaka:2010gh and the inclusion of the 33 and 24 processes .",
    "we just estimate the effect to be @xmath4 times the leading order which is @xmath218 at @xmath167 .    combining the above analyses , we consider errors from ( a ) to ( c ) . to compute a recommended range for @xmath0",

    "the errors are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated , the total rate is @xmath227 and the recommended upper ( @xmath228 ) and lower ( @xmath229 ) range for @xmath230 are @xmath231 the @xmath232 values are shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we have only carried out the leading order [ @xmath36 @xmath0 in the @xmath4 expansion . without computing the higher order contribution ,",
    "it is hard to tell at what value of @xmath4 the perturbation starts to break down . in the above section , we have naively assumed the higher order contribution to be the leading order times @xmath192 , i.e. the expansion breaks down at @xmath243 .",
    "however , explicit computations of thermal dynamical quantities and transport coefficients showed that the break down might happen at smaller @xmath4 @xcite ( the screening mass computation breaks down at @xmath196 @xcite and the heavy quark diffusion constant computation breaks down at @xmath244@xcite ) .    looking more closely to our leading order @xmath0 shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "2 , the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath0 changes qualitatively at @xmath196 . this could be a sign that higher order @xmath192 dependence has become as important as the leading order one .",
    "thus , the higher order corrections could be bigger than our previous estimation , and our result might be only reliable when @xmath7 .",
    "having said that , it is interesting that our @xmath0 bends slightly upward at @xmath197 as if @xmath0 is trying to avoid going below the conjectured @xmath245 bound .",

    "the errors from not implementing htl and the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in the 23 process , and from the uncalculated higher order [ @xmath248 corrections , have been estimated .",
