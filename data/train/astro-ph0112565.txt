    "the recent distance measurements of type ia supernovae suggest an accelerating expansion of the present universe @xcite . in many of the current cosmological models ,",
    "the present accelerating expansion is driven by an energy source called `` dark energy '' , with a positive cosmological constant @xcite or the so - called `` quintessence '' ( a slowly evolving scalar field @xcite ) as a possible candidate . instead of attributing this acceleration to the mysterious dark energy , we consider in this paper the possible existence of extra spatial dimensions and",
    "explore the feasibility of producing the present accelerating expansion via the evolution of these extra dimensions .",
    "the application of extra dimensions is a general feature in theories beyond the standard model , especially in theories for unifying gravity and other forces , such as superstring theory .",
    "these extra dimensions should be `` hidden '' for consistency with observations .",
    "various scenarios for `` hidden '' extra dimensions have been proposed , for example , a brane world with large compact extra dimensions in factorizable geometry proposed by arkani - hamed _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and a brane world with noncompact extra dimensions in nonfactorizable geometry proposed by randall and sundrum . in this paper , we employ the simplest scenario : small compact extra dimensions in factorizable geometry , as introduced in the kaluza - klein theories .",

    "we analyze the einstein equations to show qualitatively the behavior of this evolution and obtain numerical solutions which illustrate explicitly the accelerating expansion of the ordinary three - space along with the collapse of the extra space .",
    "we note that , while the kaluza - klein cosmology and inflation in higher dimensional space - time in connection with the early universe were discussed widely in the 1980s @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ; for recent work , see @xcite ) , the focus of this paper has to do with the present accelerating matter - dominated universe .",
    "we consider a metric of a ( 3+n+1)-dimensional space - time , in which both the ordinary three - space and the extra ( or `` hidden '' ) space are homogeneous and isotropic : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are scale factors , and the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related to the curvatures of the ordinary three - space and the extra space , respectively . assuming that the matter content in this higher - dimensional space is taken to be a perfect fluid , we can write the einstein equations , which govern the evolution of the ordinary three - space and the extra space , as @xmath7 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b}\\right)^2 + \\frac{k_b}{b^2 } \\right ] + 3n\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a } \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b } = 8 \\pi \\bar{g } \\bar{\\rho } \\ , , \\label{g00 eq with extra dim}\\ ] ] @xmath8 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b}\\right)^2 + \\frac{k_b}{b^2 } \\right ] + 2n \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a } \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b } \\right ) = - 8 \\pi \\bar{g } \\bar{p}_a \\ , , \\label{gii eq with extra dim}\\ ] ] @xmath9 + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b}\\right)^2 + \\frac{k_b}{b^2 } \\right ] & & \\nonumber \\\\ + 3(n-1)\\left ( \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a }",

    "first of all , we consider a radiation - dominated universe with @xmath20 for such a universe , we can read off , from eqs .",

    "( [ g00 eq with extra dim const b ] ) and ( [ gii eq with extra dim const b ] ) , the latter being the equations that describe the evolution of a four - dimensional radiation - dominated universe in the standard cosmology .",
    "in addition , the constant @xmath21 solution is stable under small perturbations of scale factors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a fact that can be shown straightforwardly .",
    "in other words , we can retrieve the ordinary evolution path of a radiation - dominated universe within a higher - dimensional space - time with static extra dimensions . on the other hand , for a matter - dominated universe with @xmath25 ,",
    "there is no solution corresponding to constant @xmath21 ( unless @xmath26 ) .    as a parenthetical remark ,",
    "if we wish to obtain a solution with the same evolution path as a four - dimensional matter - dominated universe in the standard cosmology , that is , @xmath27 const and @xmath3 satisfies @xmath28 @xmath29 the matter in the extra space needs to provide negative pressure @xmath30 although it provides negligible pressure in the ordinary three - space .",
    "it seems unusual to provide pressure in such a strange manner .",
    "nevertheless , it is in fact still possible that , if the nonrelativistic `` particles '' in the ordinary three - space are in fact extended objects ( like strings ) in the extra space , they may provide pressure in this manner .",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ alpha - volume relation ] ) that the difference @xmath35 will either decrease or grow as the volume @xmath36 of the higher - dimensional world grows or decreases .",
    "for a radiation - dominated universe with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 accordingly , if @xmath36 [ the volume of overall ( 3+n)-dimensional space ] is growing , the expansion rate of the extra space will drop and approach zero .",
    "we note that this feature also indicates the stability of the constant-@xmath21 solution mentioned above in a radiation - dominated universe . on the other hand , for a matter - dominated universe with @xmath41 or for a more general case with @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 accordingly , if the volume @xmath36 is growing , the expansion rates of the ordinary three - space and the extra space will tend to approach each other .",
    "if the volume @xmath36 is decreasing , on the other hand , with one expanding space and one collapsing space , then either @xmath44 or @xmath45 will become larger and larger .",
    "we note that an increasing positive expansion rate represents an accelerating expansion .",
    "thus , the accelerating expansion of our universe ( the ordinary three - space ) may be generated along with the collapse of the extra space , as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider a ( 1 + 3+n)-dimensional matter - dominated universe and wish to explore , both analytically and numerically , the possibility of generating the accelerating expansion of the ordinary three - space via the the evolution of the extra space .",

    "we can see that the fraction @xmath58[@xmath59 is the key quantity in the above conditions for swaying the acceleration status of the ordinary three - space .",
    "therefore it is essential to investigate possible evolution paths of the fraction @xmath58 , i.e. , to see the behavior of @xmath60 in different regions of @xmath61 .    using eqs .",

    "[ accel - decel plot ] , we can see that there are two `` attractors '' at @xmath71 and at @xmath72 , and one `` repeller '' at @xmath73 .",
    "the higher - dimensional world will approach the state at @xmath74 for the class of initial conditions satisfying @xmath75 , while it will approach @xmath76 for the other initial - condition class @xmath77 .",
    "accordingly , the higher - dimensional world possesses four kinds of evolution path corresponding to different @xmath78 ( the initial value of @xmath61 ) :    @xmath79    consequently , we can see that the situation in eq.([decelerate - accelerate ] ) may properly describe our universe .",
    "in this situation , the universe is in the region @xmath80 initially and the ordinary three - space expands in a decelerating manner during the period when @xmath61 evolves within this region , while the extra space always collapses . after some time",
    "the ordinary three - space will start to accelerate as @xmath61 passes @xmath68 in the collapsing process of the extra space .",

    "( [ ddot - a ] ) and ( [ ddot - b ] ) numerically for the case of @xmath81 .",
    "we consider the initial time to be the moment when the nonrelativistic matter starts to take over and dominate the universe , which is usually denoted by @xmath82 ( where eq means `` matter - radiation equality '' ) .",
    "the results are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ln - a & dot - b plot ] and fig .  [ ln - a - combine ] , in which five evolution paths corresponding to various initial conditions are drawn .",

    "we can see that the evolution path is very sensitive to the initial value of @xmath61 and , more importantly , there exists a critical value @xmath95 , which is indeed the parameter @xmath64 and is about @xmath96 for @xmath81 , such that the ordinary three - space will either expand in a decelerating manner for @xmath97 or accelerate eventually for @xmath98 .    to sum up , the analysis of the matter - dominated case with @xmath46 leads to fig .",
    "[ accel - decel plot ] .",
    "four classes of evolution path , as described in eqs .",
    "( [ path class 4])([path class 1 ] ) , can be read off from fig.[accel - decel plot ] .",
    "the situation that may appropriately describe our universe is the one suggested by eq.([decelerate - accelerate ] ) , in which the ordinary three - space decelerates first and then accelerates along with the collapse of the extra space .",
    "figures [ ln - a & dot - b plot ] and [ ln - a - combine ] show five evolution path corresponding to five different initial conditions , where paths ( a ) and ( b ) illustrate the situation in eq .",

    "there exists a critical value @xmath95 , which is exactly the parameter @xmath64 , dividing these two classes of evolution paths . for the case with @xmath98 corresponding to the situation in eq .",
    "( [ decelerate - accelerate ] ) , the period before the acceleration starts is sensitive to the the initial value of @xmath61 , @xmath78 .",
    "if we require the expansion of our universe to decelerate for a long enough period before the acceleration starts in order to conserve the concordance between observations and theories regarding the early universe , the initial value of @xmath61 has to be chosen in a delicate way such that it is close enough to @xmath95 .",
    "therefore this scenario so far has a fine - tuning problem .",
    "we have investigated the scenario of producing the accelerating expansion of the present universe via evolving small extra dimensions . for a radiation - dominated universe , such as our early universe",
    ", we obtain a stable solution with static extra dimensions .",
    "accordingly , the existence of extra dimensions may have no significant influence on the evolution of the ordinary three - space .",
    "this is a good feature which we need for preserving the concordance between observations and current theories regarding the early ( radiation - dominated ) universe , especially for primordial nucleosynthesis . on the contrary ,",
    "such a solution with static extra dimensions does not exist for the present matter - dominated universe .",
    "the features of the evolution can also be read off from eq.([alpha - volume relation ] ) , or eqs .",
    "( [ alpha - volume for rd ] ) and ( [ alpha - volume for md ] ) , which are derived from eq.([alpha - volume relation ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ alpha - volume for rd ] ) shows the decreasing expansion rate of the extra space along with the increase of the @xmath37-dimensional volume @xmath36 .",
    "this implies the stability of the solution with static extra dimensions in the radiation - dominated universe for the case of @xmath46 as already mentioned above . on the other hand , eq.([alpha - volume for md ] )",
    "shows two possible evolution patterns of the matter - dominated universe : ( i ) the expansion rates of the ordinary three - space and the extra space tend to catch up with each other along with the increase of the ( 3+n)-dimensional volume @xmath36 .",
    "( ii ) one of these two expansion rates is positive and increasing , while the other is negative and decreasing , along with the decrease of the ( 3+n)-dimensional volume @xmath36 .",

    "a quantitative analysis of the matter - dominated case with @xmath46 leads to fig .",
    "[ accel - decel plot ] , which indicates four classes of evolution path .",
    "a universe that decelerates first and then accelerates is included in one of them .",
    "therefore the accelerating expansion of the present universe may be appropriately described in this scenario .",
    "in addition , the case with two extra dimensions is analyzed in detail .",
    "the five resultant evolution paths we draw demonstrate the existence of a critical value for the initial condition @xmath78 , which divides two classes of path : the one in which the universe decelerates first and then accelerates and the other in which the universe always decelerates .",
    "we note that the critical value @xmath95 is exactly the parameter @xmath64 , a `` repeller '' in the flow diagram .",
    "however , the existence of the critical value ( or the `` repeller '' ) also implies a fine - tuning problem , i.e. , the initial value of @xmath61 has to be chosen delicately so that it is close enough to the critical value @xmath95 in order to possess a long enough decelerating epoch followed by an accelerating epoch .",
    "the existence of extra dimensions is a general feature in theories beyond the standard model in particle physics .",
    "it may manifest itself as a source of energy in the ordinary three - space , such as `` effective '' dark energy or even `` effective '' dark matter .",
    "the geometrical structure and the evolution pattern of extra dimensions therefore may play an important role in cosmology . in this work we study a simple scenario of extra dimensions that is subject to a fine - tuning problem .",
    "nevertheless , other scenarios with richer structures , such as those in @xcite and , may also provide suitable evolution patterns and are worthy of being further investigated .",
    "_ note added_. for the sake of simplicity , we have in this paper considered only the case with @xmath46 , i.e. , both our ordinary three - space and the extra space are flat .",
