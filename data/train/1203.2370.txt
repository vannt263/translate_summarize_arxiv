    "the strain engineering has already become an important technological approach which enables to enhance the properties of many electronic materials . in ferroelectrics , due to the large strain  polarization coupling , the strain effects are especially important .",
    "for example , in ferroelectric thin films and superlattices , the biaxial strain can be used to finely tune the ferroelectric , dielectric , and piezoelectric properties of these materials .  @xcite    the influence of hydrostatic pressure on displacive phase transitions was first analyzed by samara _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite who explained why an increase in pressure usually decreases the temperature of phase transitions associated with soft optical phonons at the center of the brillouin zone and increases the temperature of phase transitions associated with soft phonons at the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "recently , a very different behavior of the ferroelectric properties was discovered in pbtio@xmath1 at high pressures ; the observed enhancement of the ferroelectric instability with increasing pressure was explained by the original electronic mechanism of ferroelectricity .",
    "@xcite the enhancement of ferroelectricity at high pressures was predicted for many oxides with the perovskite structure .",
    "@xcite these interesting findings necessitate further studies of the pressure effects on the ferroelectric properties .    despite limited experimental data on mercury titanate , this",
    "material exhibits interesting but contradictory ferroelectric properties .",
    "mercury titanate hgtio@xmath1 can be prepared from hgo and tio@xmath5 at pressures of 6065  kbar .",
    "@xcite the obtained crystals have a rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure .",
    "the observation of second harmonic generation ( shg ) in hgtio@xmath1 at 300  k  @xcite enabled to propose that mercury titanate is non - centrosymmetric and its space group is @xmath0 .",
    "however , because of limited accuracy , the atomic coordinates in ref .",
    "were determined only for centrosymmetric structure @xmath6 .",
    "subsequent studies of dielectric properties of mercury titanate  @xcite did not found sharp dielectric anomalies : a strongly asymmetric broad peak with a maximum dielectric constant of @xmath7800 at about 220  k and a noticeable hysteresis in the heating  cooling cycle as well as weak narrow peak at about 515  k were observed . at 300  k",
    "no dielectric hysteresis loops were observed in electric fields up to 10@xmath8  v / m .",

    "x - ray diffraction studies of hgtio@xmath1 under hydrostatic pressure  @xcite revealed non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath9 interplanar distance and of the ( 104)(110 ) doublet splitting at @xmath10  kbar , which was explained by a phase transition from the rhombohedral to the cubic phase .",
    "studies of the electronic structure  @xcite of rhombohedral and cubic modifications of hgtio@xmath1 using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method showed that the rhombohedral @xmath6 phase is a direct - gap semiconductor with the band gap energy of @xmath71.6  ev , whereas the cubic phase is a metal .    to resolve the inconsistency of the ferroelectric properties of hgtio@xmath1 and predict other properties of this material , first - principles calculations of the ground - state structure , phonon spectra , optical and elastic properties of mercury titanate at hydrostatic pressures up to 210  kbar were performed in this paper .",

    "the calculations show that with increasing pressure , the contribution of the @xmath45 term gives about 95% of the change in @xmath46 in our crystals , and so at high pressures the phase with a minimum specific volume becomes more stable . as follows from table  [ table2 ] , at @xmath3",

    "moreover , with increasing pressure , the suppression of ferroelectricity should be observed ( the @xmath50 phase transition ) .    , @xmath0 , @xmath47 , and @xmath13 phases and the @xmath6 phase of hgtio@xmath1 as a function of hydrostatic pressure .",
    "]    the enthalpy differences between the phases under consideration and the @xmath6 phase as a function of pressure are plotted in fig .",
    "it is seen that hgtio@xmath1 should undergo the @xmath51 phase transition at @xmath52  kbar and the @xmath53 one at 141  kbar .",
    "as both phase transitions are accompanied by abrupt changes in the volume of the unit cell at the transition pressure ( 6% and 0.71% , respectively ) , they should be of the first order . the @xmath47 phase , whose enthalpy at @xmath3 is lower than that of the @xmath13 phase , at higher pressure becomes thermodynamically less stable and so can be excluded from consideration .",
    "similar behavior , when stable @xmath12 phase transformed under high pressure and temperature to the pressure - stabilized @xmath13 phase , from which the metastable @xmath6 phase appeared after releasing the pressure , was observed in mntio@xmath1 ,  @xcite fetio@xmath1 ,  @xcite and zngeo@xmath1 .",

    "@xcite     mode frequency in the @xmath6 phase of hgtio@xmath1 as a function of hydrostatic pressure . ]    to determine the pressure of the @xmath50 phase transition accurately , the square of the @xmath54 phonon frequency in the @xmath6 phase was plotted as a function of hydrostatic pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it turned out that this dependence is non - monotonic and the pressure of the phase transition is @xmath7152  kbar .",
    "this means that in the whole pressure range before the phase transformation to the @xmath13 phase at 141  kbar the ground state at @xmath55 is ferroelectric ( the @xmath0 phase ) . in the @xmath13 phase ,",
    "the ferroelectric instability is absent .",
    "an interesting feature which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is the reentrance of the ferroelectric instability in the @xmath6 phase at pressures above 290  kbar .",
    "similar behavior of the ferroelectric mode frequency with increasing pressure was predicted for a number of oxides with the cubic perovskite structure  @xcite and explained by an increased mixing of the ti @xmath56 and the o @xmath57 orbitals at high pressures .",
    "the effect observed in hgtio@xmath1 needs further investigation , but it should be noted that it is observed in a crystal in which the oxygen environment around the ti atom is different from that in cubic perovskites .",
    "the obtained results enable to propose new interpretation of the phase transition observed in high - pressure x - ray experiments .",
    "@xcite the specific energy of the cubic ( @xmath58 ) phase , which was considered in refs .   as a high - pressure phase , is about 1  ev higher than the specific energy of the @xmath6 phase , and its specific volume is higher than that of the @xmath6 phase ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this means that the large difference in enthalpies of these phases will only increase with increasing pressure .",
    "therefore , the @xmath58 phase should not be considered as a high - pressure phase . according to our calculations , the pressure coefficient of the rhombohedral angle in the @xmath6 phase is @xmath59@xmath60/kbar , and so at @xmath61  kbar the structure remains strongly distorted , with a relative decrease of interplanar distance of about @xmath62% .",
    "this value is several times smaller than the relative decrease of interplanar distance observed at the transition pressure .",
    "however , if one assumes that in refs .   the pressure was measured incorrectly ( according to our estimates , it was underestimated by 57  times ) , and one takes the relative change of the @xmath9 interplanar distance at @xmath3 shown in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "disagree with the lattice parameters given in this paper for the same pressure ( the deviation is about 5% ) .",
    "] as a measure of pressure , the agreement between our calculations and experiment becomes satisfactory .",
    "indeed , at the @xmath63 phase - transition pressure ( 141  kbar ) the calculated decrease of the @xmath9 interplanar distance ( compared to @xmath3 ) is 2.0% , whereas in experiment it is 2.3% . the calculated drop in mean interplanar distance phase transition the ( 012 ) peak splits into two components with ( 110 ) and ( 002 ) indices . ] at the phase transition ( 0.054% ) is also close to that observed in the experiment ( @xmath70.05% ) .",
    "and @xmath13 phases of hgtio@xmath1 at @xmath64  kbar ( for cu @xmath65-radiation ) . ]",
    "the lattice parameters and atomic coordinates for the @xmath13 structure at 141  kbar are given in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "the calculated diffraction patterns for the @xmath6 and @xmath13 phases at 141  kbar are shown in fig .",
    "the pattern for the @xmath13 phase is really close to that observed in the high - pressure experiment .",
    "@xcite when transforming to the high - pressure phase , the ( 012 ) line becomes broader because in the orthorhombic phase a pair of close lines with indices ( 002 ) and ( 110 ) appears .",
    "the ( 021 ) line characteristic for the orthorhombic phase is clearly seen in experimental diffraction patterns obtained during releasing the pressure .",
    "@xcite the most serious disagreement between our calculation and experiment consists in the absence of ( 111 ) line of the orthorhombic phase in the diffraction patterns at high pressure .",
    "possibly , this is due to the incompleteness of structural transformation .",
    "we think that new high - pressure experiments are needed to check the proposed interpretation of the high - pressure phase transition in hgtio@xmath1 .      as was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec3c ] , the inconsistency between the observation of sgh signal and the absence of dielectric hysteresis loops in hgtio@xmath1 at 300  k can be explained by easiness of the defect formation .",
    "indeed , according to ref .  ,",
    "the samples darkened when exposed to light .",
    "the absence of a sharp peak on the temperature dependence of dielectric constant at the curie temperature can also be explained by the existence of defects . to clarify why the defect formation in hgtio@xmath1",
    "is so easy , first - principles calculations of the thermodynamic stability of mercury titanate were performed .    to check the thermodynamic stability of hgtio@xmath1 ,",
    "the enthalpy of the @xmath6 phase was compared with that of the mixture of starting components , orthorhombic hgo and rutile tio@xmath5 .",
    "the calculations showed that at @xmath3 the enthalpy of mercury titanate is 150  mev ( per formula unit ) higher than the sum of enthalpies of hgo and tio@xmath5 .",
    "this means that at @xmath3 mercury titanate is thermodynamically unstable against its decomposition into starting components .",
    "however , because the specific volume of the hgtio@xmath1 unit cell is significantly lower than the sum of specific volumes of hgo and tio@xmath5 , the stability of hgtio@xmath1 increases with increasing pressure .",
    "for example , at 58.8  kbar the enthalpy of hgtio@xmath1 is 75  mev lower than the sum of enthalpies of hgo and tio@xmath5 .",
    "this explains why the synthesis of mercury titanate is possible only at high pressures .",
    "first - principles calculations within the density functional theory have revealed that the @xmath0 structure experimentally observed in hgtio@xmath1 is metastable at ambient pressure . with increasing hydrostatic pressure , the ground - state structure changes following the @xmath2 sequence , and so a new interpretation of the phase transition observed at high pressure is proposed .",
    "it is shown that the appearance of ferroelectricity in hgtio@xmath1 at @xmath3 is associated with an unstable phonon mode .",
    "optical and elastic properties of different phases of mercury titanate are calculated .",
    "the band gap obtained in the _ gw _ approximation ( @xmath4  ev ) agrees with the experimental data better than the value obtained in the lda approximation ( 1.49  ev ) .",
