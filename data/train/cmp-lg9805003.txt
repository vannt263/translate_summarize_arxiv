    "most methods for estimating translation models from parallel texts ( bitexts ) start with the following intuition : words that are translations of each other are more likely to appear in corresponding bitext regions than other pairs of words .",
    "the intuition is simple , but its correct exploitation turns out to be rather subtle .",
    "most of the literature on translation model estimation presumes that corresponding regions of the input bitexts are represented by neatly aligned segments . as discovered by @xcite ,",
    "most of the bitexts available today are not easy to align . moreover ,",
    "imposing an alignment relation on such bitexts is inefficient , because alignments can not capture crossing correspondences among text segments .",
    "@xcite proposed methods for producing general bitext maps for arbitrary bitexts .",
    "the present report shows how to use bitext maps and other information to construct a model of co - occurrence .",
    "a * model of co - occurrence * is a boolean predicate , which indicates whether a given pair of word _ tokens _ co - occur in corresponding regions of the bitext space .",
    "co - occurrence is a precondition for the possibility that two tokens might be mutual translations .",
    "models of co - occurrence are the glue that binds methods for mapping bitext correspondence with methods for estimating translation models into an integrated system for exploiting parallel texts . when the model of co - occurrence is modularized away from the translation model , it also becomes easier to study translation model estimation methods _ per se_.    different models of co -",
    "occurrence are possible , depending on the kind of bitext map that is available , the language - specific information that is available , and the assumptions made about the nature of translational equivalence .",
    "the following three sections explore these three variables .",
    "by definition of `` mutual translations , '' corresponding regions of a text and its translation will contain word token pairs that are mutual translations .",
    "therefore , a general representation of bitext correspondence is the natural concept on which to build a model of where mutual translations co - occur .",
    "the most general representation of bitext correspondence is a bitext map @xcite .",
    "token pairs whose co - ordinates are part of the true bitext map ( tbm ) are mutual translations , by definition of the tbm .",
    "the likelihood that two tokens are mutual translations is inversely correlated with the distance between the tokens co - ordinate in the bitext space and the interpolated tbm .",
    "it may be possible to develop translation model estimation methods that take into account a probabilistic model of co - occurrence . however , all the models in the literature are based on a boolean co - occurrence model  they want to know either that two tokens co - occur or that they do not",
    ". a boolean co - occurrence predicate can be defined by setting a threshold @xmath0 on the distance from the interpolated bitext map .",
    "any token pair whose co - ordinate is closer than @xmath0 to the bitext map would be considered to co - occur by this predicate .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath0 varies with the language pair , the bitext genre and the application .",
    "figure  [ dcooc ] illustrates what i will call the * distance - based model of co - occurrence*. @xcite were the first to use a distance - based model of co - occurrence , although they measured the distance in words rather than in characters .",
    "general bitext mapping algorithms are a recent invention .",
    "so far , most researchers interested in co - occurrence of mutual translations have relied on bitexts where sentence boundaries ( or other text unit boundaries ) were easy to find @xcite .",
    "aligned text segments suggest a * boundary - based model of co - occurrence * , illustrated in figure  [ scooc ] .    for bitexts involving languages with similar word order , a more accurate * combined model of co - occurrence *",
    "can be built using both segment boundary information and the map - distance threshold .",
    "as shown in figure  [ bcooc ] , each of these constraints eliminates the noise from a characteristic region of the bitext space .",
    "both the boundary - based and distance - based constraints restrict the region of the bitext space where tokens may be considered to co - occur . yet , these constraints do not answer the question of how to count co - occurrences within the restricted regions .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that this is a question at all , and most authors ignore it .",
    "however , when authors specify their algorithms in sufficient detail to answer this question , the most common answer ( given , , by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) turns out to be unsound .",
    "the problem is easiest to illustrate under the boundary - based model of co - occurrence .",
    "given two aligned text segments , the naive way to count co - occurrences is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the frequencies of occurrence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in their respective segments . for",
    "many * u * and * v * , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are either 0 or 1 , and equation  [ naivecooc ] returns 1 just in case both words occur .",
    "the problem arises when @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 , then according to equation  [ naivecooc ] , @xmath9 ! if the two aligned segments are really translations of each other , then it is most likely that each of the occurrences of @xmath4 is a translation of just one of the occurrences of @xmath5 .",
    "although it may not be known which of the 3 @xmath10 s each @xmath11 corresponds to , the number of times that @xmath12 and @xmath5 co - occur as possible translations of each other in that segment pair must be 3 .",
    "there are various ways to arrive at @xmath13 .",
    "two of the simplest ways are @xmath14\\ ] ] and @xmath15 .\\ ] ] equation  [ mincount ] is based on the simplifying assumption that each word is translated to at most one other word . equation  [ maxcount ] is based on the simplifying assumption that each word is translated to at least one other word . either simplifying assumption results in more plausible co - occurrence counts than the naive method in equation  [ naivecooc ] .    counting co - occurrences is more difficult under a distance - based co - occurrence model , because there are no aligned segments and consequently no useful definition for @xmath16 and @xmath17 . furthermore , under a distance - based co - occurrence model , the co - occurrence relation is not transitive . _",
    "e.g. _ , it is possible that @xmath18 co - occurs with @xmath19 , @xmath19 co - occurs with @xmath20 , @xmath20 co - occurs with @xmath21 , but @xmath18 does not co - occur with @xmath21 .",
    "the correct counting method becomes clearer if the problem is recast in graph - theoretic terms .",
    "let the words in each half of the bitext represent the vertices on one side of a bipartite graph .",
    "let there be edges between each pair of words whose co - ordinates are closer than @xmath0 to the bitext map .",
    "now , under the `` at most one '' assumption of equation  [ mincount ] , each co - occurrence is represented by an edge in the graph s maximum matching . under the `` at least one '' assumption of equation  [ maxcount ] , each co - occurrence is represented by an edge in the graph s smallest vertex cover .",
    "maximum matching can be computed in polynomial time for any graph @xcite .",
    "vertex cover can be solved in polynomial time for bipartite graphs .",
    "it is of no importance that maximum matchings and minimum vertex covers may be non - unique  by definition , all solutions have the same number of edges , and this number is the correct co - occurrence count .",
    "co - occurrence is a universal precondition for translational equivalence among word tokens in bitexts .",
    "other preconditions may be imposed if certain language - specific resources are available @xcite .",
    "for example , parts of speech tend to be preserved in translation @xcite . if part - of - speech taggers are available for both languages in a bitext , and if cases where one part of speech is translated to another are not important for the intended application , then we can rule out the possibility of translational equivalence for all token pairs involving different parts of speech",
    ". a more obvious source of language - specific information is a machine - readable bilingual dictionary ( mrbd ) .",
    "if token @xmath22 in one half of the bitext is found to co - occur with token @xmath23 in the other half , and @xmath24 is an entry in the mrbd , then it is highly likely that the tokens @xmath22 and @xmath23 are indeed mutual translations . in this case",
    ", there is no point considering the co - occurrence of @xmath22 or @xmath23 with any other token .",
    "similarly exclusive candidacy can be granted to cognate token pairs @xcite .",
    "most published translation models treat co - occurrence counts as counts of potential link tokens @xcite .",
    "more accurate models may result if the co - occurrence counts are biased with language - specific knowledge . without loss of generality , whenever translation models refer to co - occurrence counts , they can refer to co - occurrence counts that have been filtered using whatever language - specific resources happen to be available .",
    "it does not matter if there are dependencies among the different knowledge sources , as long as each is used as a simple filter on the co - occurrence relation @xcite .",
    "in this short report , i have investigated methods for modeling word token co - occurrence in parallel texts ( bitexts ) .",
    "models of co - occurrence are a precursor to all the most accurate translation models in the literature .",
    "so far , most researchers have relied on only a restricted form of co - occurrence , based on a restricted kind of bitext map , applicable to only a limited class of bitexts .",
    "a more general co - occurrence model can be based on any bitext map , and thus on any bitext .    the correct method for counting the number of times that two words co - occur turns out to be rather subtle , especially for more general co - occurrence models . as noted in section  [ countmethod ] , many published translation models have been based on flawed models of co - occurrence .",
