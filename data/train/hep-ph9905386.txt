    "we present results for the hadronic production of a vector boson pair , including all spin correlations in the decay of the final state bosons , @xmath7 where @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the calculations are performed in next - to - leading order in @xmath10 .",
    "we implement the helicity amplitudes of  @xcite and thus extend previous treatments of vector boson pair production ( @xcite@xcite and @xcite@xcite ) to include spin correlations in all the partonic matrix elements . by including the decay products in this way it is possible to impose experimental cuts , necessary to compare theory with experiment .",
    "some cuts are experimentally necessary and more stringent cuts are often useful in order to reduce backgrounds in the search for new physics . although phenomenological predictions including the _ complete _ one loop predictions are presented here for the first time , this may be a matter of theoretical correctness rather than practical importance .",
    "the early predictions were performed at @xmath11 and to a limited extent at @xmath12 , so an update of the phenomenological results is in any case appropriate .",
    "we have therefore provided predictions for @xmath3 collisions at @xmath13 ( tevatron run ii ) and for @xmath5 collisions at @xmath14  ( lhc ) .",
    "since the early predictions were made , there have been changes in @xmath15 and the determination of the gluon distribution , especially at small @xmath16 .",
    "we include this information by using modern parton distributions .",
    "our results are obtained using a monte carlo program @xmath17 which allows the calculation of any infra - red finite quantity through order @xmath15 .",
    "the monte carlo program is constructed using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the subtraction technique of ref .",
    "we hope to provide further details in a subsequent publication .",
    "as already noted , there is a substantial existing literature on vector boson pair production in hadronic collisions . as a cross - check of our results",
    ", we will compare the values of the total cross section obtained using our monte carlo ( @xmath17 ) with those of frixione , nason , mele and ridolfi  @xcite .",
    "since the earlier predictions were made at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath18  tev and @xmath19  tev , we will also provide up - to - date values for @xmath20 collisions at @xmath21  tev and @xmath5 collisions at @xmath22  tev .",
    "these run ii tevatron and lhc predictions contain the latest parton distribution sets  @xcite as well as more recent electroweak input .",
    "we will first present a comparison with older results on the total cross section .",
    "we use the structure function set hmrsb  @xcite , which is common amongst the calculations of  @xcite .",
    "this set corresponds to a four - flavour value of @xmath23  mev . for the purposes of comparison we use the standard two loop expression  @xcite @xmath24,\\ ] ] and match to five flavors at @xmath25 .",
    "this yields a strong coupling at the @xmath26-mass of , @xmath27 the renormalization and factorization scales are chosen to be equal to the average mass of the produced boson pair ( namely , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .    finally , since the early calculations present results for the production of two on - shell vector bosons , we need to ensure that in our monte carlo ( in which we produce 4 final - state leptons ) we use the narrow - width approximation where only doubly - resonant diagrams are included .",
    "the on - shell boson cross sections can be obtained by dividing out by the relevant branching ratios . a full discussion of the other diagrams included in our approach is given in section  [ beyondzw ] .",
    "the comparison of the results for a @xmath5 collider at centre of mass energies of @xmath18  tev and @xmath19  tev is shown in tables  [ comp16 ] and  [ comp40 ] respectively .",
    "for the cases of @xmath31 and @xmath32 pair production , the values for comparison are taken directly from  @xcite and  @xcite . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the results are slightly different from those published in  @xcite since the contribution from processes of the type @xmath34 with the top quark taken massless ( which it is no longer appropriate to include ) have been removed .",
    "the comparison between our results and the results of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite is satisfactory .",
    "apart from their role as a check of our programs the results in tables  [ comp16 ] and [ comp40 ] should be considered obsolete .",
    ".total cross section for the various di - boson processes at @xmath18  tev . for the cases of @xmath35 and @xmath36 production the electroweak parameters are , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40@xcite . for @xmath26 pairs",
    "the input is instead , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath39@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented a monte carlo program for vector - boson pair production at hadron colliders , including for the first time the complete @xmath43 corrections with leptonic decay correlations .",
    "we have employed this program to calculate the total di - boson cross - sections , first as a cross - check with existing results in the literature and secondly in order to provide an update of predictions for run ii at the tevatron and for the lhc , including the latest structure functions and strong coupling .",
    "the cross sections are larger than previous estimates in the literature .",
    "the advantage of this monte carlo is only realized when cuts are applied to the final - state leptons .",
    "this is primarily of importance when estimating standard model backgrounds to new physics , which is especially crucial at the tevatron . for this reason we have provided two examples of such uses in run ii , tri - lepton production as a susy signal and a di - lepton analysis for an intermediate - mass higgs search .",
    "we first introduce a separation of the total @xmath44-particle tree - level amplitude into its doubly- and singly - resonant components , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an overall coupling factor depending on the di - boson process under consideration .",
    "the contributions @xmath47 were first calculated in  @xcite although we will closely follow the more recent notation and approach of  @xcite . in particular , the amplitudes are presented in terms of particle momenta @xmath48 that are all outgoing , so that momentum conservation implies @xmath49 .      for this process",
    "we label the particles as , @xmath50 where the leptons are not necessarily of the same flavour , and we write the process in this manner to remind the reader that @xmath51 represents an outgoing quark ( so that when we cross to obtain the desired result , it becomes an incoming anti - quark ) .",
    "then from  @xcite we see that the non - vanishing doubly - resonant helicity amplitudes for up - quark annihilation are ( with labels suppressed where possible ) , @xmath52 with the sub - amplitudes @xmath53 given by equations ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) of  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 are propagator factors given by , @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the couplings that appear in these amplitudes are , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electric charge in units of the positron charge . for the additional singly - resonant diagrams we find , @xmath60 where we have introduced a further set of scaled couplings  @xcite , @xmath61 note that here the sub - amplitudes needed for the singly - resonant diagrams are exactly those introduced in  @xcite to describe the doubly - resonant diagrams .",
    "this is because the diagrams are topologically equivalent and ( modulo couplings ) we can obtain the singly resonant amplitudes by simply re - labelling the external legs .",
    "the down - quark amplitudes may be obtained simply by symmetry , @xmath62 as described in  @xcite , the doubly - resonant amplitudes for the process with an additional gluon radiated from the quark line are exactly analogous to  ( [ wwdr ] ) and require the introduction of functions @xmath63 . however , unlike the 6-particle amplitudes , these functions are not sufficient to describe the singly - resonant diagrams . in this case",
    ", initial state gluon radiation in the singly - resonant diagrams would correspond to final - state radiation in the equivalent doubly - resonant diagrams and thus we need to introduce a new set of sub - amplitudes . for a positive helicity gluon of momentum @xmath64",
    "we find , @xmath65 where the new functions are defined by , @xmath66 and , @xmath67   \\over{\\spa1.7 \\spa2.7    s_{34 }   t_{127 }   t_{345}}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our definition of the spinor products follows ref .  @xcite .",
    "the remaining amplitudes are obtained as above , with the additional ( negative helicity ) gluon corresponding , as in the doubly - resonant case , to the operation @xmath68 defined in  @xcite .",
    "as will be the case for all the amplitudes in this appendix , the loop contributions for the singly - resonant diagrams may be simply obtained by following the prescription  ( 3.20 ) of  @xcite .      here",
    "we label the two processes slightly differently , @xmath69 in order to simplify the form of the amplitudes and the overall coupling ( c.f .",
    "[ overall ] ) is , @xmath70 the doubly - resonant amplitude for a left - handed decay of the @xmath26 is , @xmath71 where the masses in the propagators are now @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for @xmath74 production",
    "we have @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the third line has a positive contribution , whilst @xmath77 corresponds to @xmath78 , @xmath79 and a negative sign .",
    "this reduces to the form given in  @xcite if we set @xmath80 to neglect the virtual photon diagrams .",
    "the right - handed amplitude is obtained by a symmetry transformation , @xmath81    the singly resonant diagrams are somewhat more complicated . with a @xmath26 propagator",
    "we can couple both electrons and neutrinos , while @xmath9 may only couple directly to the electrons .",
    "in addition , if the final state electrons are both left - handed , there is a contribution from a diagram containing two @xmath82 propagators . in total",
    "we obtain , @xmath83 where the newly introduced couplings @xmath84 and @xmath85 depend upon the process under consideration and are given by , @xmath86 the right - handed contribution is similar , but does not contain the corresponding final term , @xmath87 we now turn to the graphs including gluon radiation . for the doubly resonant contribution with a positive helicity gluon we find a similar structure , @xmath88 whilst the singly resonant pieces again require the new amplitudes , @xmath89 @xmath90 the remaining amplitudes , with the helicity of the gluon reversed , can be obtained by the transformation , @xmath91 , b_7^{\\tree , a } \\leftrightarrow b_7^{\\tree , b } \\right).\\ ] ]          f.e .",
