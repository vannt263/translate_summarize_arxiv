    "there is growing interest and activity in transfer reaction studies using radioactive beams , driven by increased secondary beam intensities and motivated by the search for new physics at the edge of nuclear stability @xcite and by the need for low - energy reaction rates for astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction , measured in inverse kinematics , is well suited for these purposes",
    ". it can provide spin - parity assignments for nuclear states , allow determination of spectroscopic strengths of single - particle configurations , and give asymptotic normalization coefficients in the tail of overlap functions .",
    "the reliability of this deduced nuclear structure information depends on the existence of a reaction theory that describes adequately the mechanism of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "this paper uses a formulation of the @xmath4 reaction amplitude that emphasizes the components of the total neutron+proton+target scattering wave function where the spatial separations between the incoming neutron and proton are confined by the range of the @xmath1-@xmath2 interaction , @xmath3 .",
    "these components contain both the bound and continuum states of the @xmath1-@xmath2 system .",
    "since the @xmath1-@xmath2 binding energy in the deuteron is small and the optical potentials that generate the tidal break - up forces are smooth functions of position , the strength of inelastic excitations to the @xmath1-@xmath2 continuum is expected to be concentrated at low @xmath1-@xmath2 relative energies .",
    "this suggests that the coupling effects between different @xmath1-@xmath2 states can be treated adiabatically and leads to a simple prescription for calculating the scattering wave function at small @xmath1-@xmath2 separations @xcite .",
    "in the adiabatic model the @xmath4 transition amplitude has exactly the same structure as that of the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) , for which many computer codes are available , which has led to its widespread use @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic model frequently provides significant improvements over the dwba for @xmath4 angular distributions and giving consistent results for nuclear structure information @xcite .",
    "there are two key ingredients in the adiabatic model : + ( i ) the assumption that only components of the three - body scattering wave function with small @xmath1-@xmath2 separation are needed for the @xmath4 transition amplitude and ( ii ) the validity of the adiabatic treatment of deuteron break - up at the nuclear surface .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to show that assumption ( i ) is justified for a useful range of reaction energies when it is implemented in terms of a precisely defined projection of the three - body scattering wave function .",
    "this projection will be shown to involve the first weinberg state component of the full wave function .",
    "investigations of how assumption ( ii ) influences the predicted @xmath0 cross sections were carried out using the quasi - adiabatic model @xcite , the weinberg states expansion ( wse ) method @xcite , the continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) method , and also faddeev equation methods @xcite .",
    "the importance of nonadiabatic effects has been found to depend on the target and incident energy and , in the worst cases , these affected both the shapes and the magnitudes of the calculated differential cross sections @xcite .",
    "there is therefore an important need to provide a practical way of introducing corrections to the adiabatic approximation .",
    "our aim here is to provide a suitable definition of the projection of the full scattering wave function implied by assumption ( i ) , which we call the first weinberg projection .",
    "we show that this projection , which is a function of only a single vector coordinate , dominates the calculation of the @xmath4 transition amplitude .",
    "this result implies that to include effects beyond the adiabatic approximation one can focus on improvements to the calculation of this projection only .    the cdcc method for solving the three - body problem",
    "does not use the adiabatic approximation ( ii ) . from a practical point of view",
    "it is well adapted to the study of deuteron breakup effects on @xmath4 reactions . in principle in the cdcc method one attempts to calculate the three - body scattering wave function in the whole six - dimensional coordinate space of the neutron+proton+target ( @xmath5 ) three - body system .",
    "our approach is to compare calculations of the @xmath0 transition amplitude made using a complete cdcc wave function with calculations which retain only the first few weinberg components of the full cdcc wave function .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe how the projection procedure mentioned above is related to the weinberg state and cdcc expansion methods and we connect these . in sec .",
    "iii we construct the weinberg components using the cdcc wave functions and in sec .",
    "iv we compare calculations of the @xmath0 transition amplitudes using the first few weinberg components .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "in the absence of inelastic excitations of the target and residual nuclei @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the incident and outgoing channels , the transition amplitude of the @xmath4 reaction can be written as @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the outgoing proton distorted wave ( where we neglect certain @xmath10 corrections @xcite ) , @xmath11 is the overlap function between the wave functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath3 is the neutron - proton interaction , and @xmath12 is the projection of the full many - body wave function onto the three - body , @xmath5 , channel with @xmath6 in its ground state . the effect of coupling to excited states of @xmath6 is implicitly taken into account through the use of complex nucleon optical potentials , but contributions from transitions that explicitly excite components of @xmath6 in the initial state and @xmath7 in the final state are ignored .",

    "these superscripts are omitted in the following text .    in the next two sections we describe two expansion schemes for the total wave function @xmath33 .      for @xmath1-@xmath2 separations",
    "@xmath27 within the range of @xmath3 , the wave function @xmath33 has the expansion @xcite @xmath34 where the weinberg states , @xmath35 , are solutions of the equation @xmath36\\phi_i^{w}({{\\bm r}})=0 , \\ \\ i=1,2,\\ldots\\ ] ] with fixed energy @xmath37 and eigenvalues @xmath38 . for radii @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is such that @xmath41 is negligible , all of the weinberg states decay exponentially , like the deuteron ground state wave function . for @xmath42 , they oscillate with a wavelength that varies with @xmath43 , becoming increasingly oscillatory with increasing @xmath43 ( see the examples given in @xcite for the case of a hulthn form for @xmath3 ) .",

    "they are therefore well adapted to expanding @xmath45 in this region .",
    "they do not satisfy the usual orthonormality relation but instead satisfy @xmath46 where the value @xmath47 for @xmath48 has been chosen for convenience .",
    "this form of orthonormality , with a weight factor @xmath3 , means that if one wishes to represent an arbitrary state @xmath49 as a linear superposition of weinberg states then the unique choice of coefficients @xmath50 which minimizes the difference @xmath51 is @xmath52 use of a factor @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , which weights @xmath44 values according to @xmath3 , provides a natural scheme for constructing the expansion coefficients for states of @xmath1-@xmath2 relative motion for use in the @xmath0 transition amplitude .",
    "the cdcc method involves the expansion of @xmath33 in terms of a complete set of @xmath1-@xmath2 continuum bin states @xmath53 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , written @xmath54 the bin states are linear superpositions of continuum eigenfunctions of @xmath55 , on chosen intervals @xmath56 of @xmath1-@xmath2 continuum wave numbers , and are orthogonal in the usual sense .",

    "these cdcc equations can be solved numerically and their convergence properties have been intensively studied .",
    "it is known from experience with cdcc calculations that the energy range of @xmath1-@xmath2 continuum states that are coupled to the incident deuteron channel is limited to tens of mev .",
    "thus , we expect that inside the range of @xmath3 the wave function @xmath33 will not be a strongly oscillatory function of @xmath44 and only a few terms of the weinberg expansion will be needed to evaluate the @xmath0 matrix element .",
    "note that this has nothing to do with the strength of the coupling between weinberg components in @xmath33 or how rapidly the weinberg expansion for @xmath33 itself converges , but rather it relates to how rapid the convergence of the sequence of contributions to the @xmath0 amplitude is from the different weinberg components .",
    "we do not obtain the latter from a set of coupled equations , as , e.g. , was done successfully in ref .",
    "@xcite , but rather from the cdcc expansion of @xmath33 . the quantitative issues arising from a comparison with the approach of ref .",

    "<S> we use the @xmath0 reaction at 30 and 100 mev as examples of contemporary interest . </S>",
    "<S> the generality of this observed dominance and its implications for future theoretical developments are discussed . </S>"
