    "tiling properties of polyominoes have been studied by many authors using various methods ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we will assume that a polyomino @xmath0 is a map from @xmath1 to @xmath2 that takes the values 0 and 1 .",
    "we associate a value 1 of @xmath3 at @xmath4with the unit square @xmath5\\times \\lbrack m , m+1]$ ] .",
    "this allows us to envision polyominoes in the usual way as tiles in the plane .",
    "we assume @xmath0  has finitely many occupied squares .",
    "( several authors including s. golomb refer to these objects as quasi - polyominoes ( @xcite , pg .",
    "85 ) , and reserve the term polyomino for rookwise connected figures .",
    "a figure is rookwise connected if it can be constructed by placing squares in a way that each square except for the first shares an edge with a previously placed square .",
    "we will not assume rookwise connectedness or topological connectedness unless declared . )",
    "let @xmath0 be any map @xmath6  ( not necessarily a polyomino map ) .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is nonzero for finitely many pairs @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 , and let @xmath10 be the number of pairs @xmath8 such that @xmath7 is not zero",
    ". both of these are norms in the usual sense .",
    "the assumption implies that both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are finite , and we say that @xmath0 has finite area . if @xmath0 is a polyomino , the two norms are equal , and we use the notation @xmath12 .    for any map @xmath0 as above , of finite area ,",
    "let diam@xmath13 denote the maximum of the distances between pairs of points of support of @xmath0 under the taxicab metric .",
    "the taxicab distance between two points is the minimum number of grid steps from one point to the other ( a grid step is a move from @xmath14 to @xmath15 where @xmath16 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath0 and @xmath17 are two maps @xmath6 such that at least one of them has finite area .",
    "define @xmath18 as : @xmath19    @xmath20 counts the number of intersections of @xmath0 with an @xmath8 translate of the reflection of @xmath17 across the origin .",
    "it is clear that the sum in the definition is finite for a fixed @xmath8 , and @xmath21 has finite area if both @xmath0 and @xmath17 do .",
    "we call @xmath21 the convolution of @xmath0 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to see that diam@xmath22diam@xmath23diam@xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath17 are polyominoes , then their convolution @xmath18 is not a polyomino in general since @xmath21 may assume values other than @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "but one may obtain a polyomino from @xmath21 by reducing each @xmath20 to @xmath25 or @xmath26 depending on its congruence class modulo 2 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a convolution operation on the set of polyominoes .",
    "this operation inherits the associativity and bilinearity properties of the usual convolution , since reduction modulo 2 commutes with the operations of addition and multiplication that constitute the convolution .",
    "denote the composition of convolution and the reduction modulo 2 by @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , denote the composition of convolution and reduction modulo @xmath28 for an arbitrary modulus @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "here is our main observation :    [ thm : main ] suppose that @xmath0 is a polyomino symmetric under rotations of @xmath30 degrees .",
    "suppose @xmath17 is a polyomino .",
    "then if @xmath31 , or if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the unique integer among @xmath34 congruent to @xmath12 modulo @xmath28 , then copies of @xmath17 can not tile the plane ( i.e. cover it without overlaps )  , translations and rotations being allowed.(here we are thinking of @xmath17 s as tiles )    * proof : * say that copies of @xmath17 tile the plane .",
    "this is another way to say that the full plane is a sum of non overlapping translates of copies of @xmath17 and its rotations . since @xmath0 is rotationally symmetric , @xmath0 convolved with @xmath17 has the same norms as @xmath0 convolved with a rotation of @xmath17 .",
    "consider a minimal pattern of @xmath17 s in this tiling that contains a full @xmath35 by @xmath35 square . call this figure @xmath36 for reference .",
    "@xmath36 is certainly contained in a @xmath37diam@xmath24 by @xmath37diam@xmath24 square , otherwise it would nt be minimal . since @xmath36 is obtained as a disjoint sum of @xmath17 s , its norm is simply the sum of the norms of its constituents .",
    "we are going to estimate norms of @xmath38 from two directions .",
    "first of all , @xmath39 has at least @xmath40diam@xmath41 points of value @xmath12 , since at least that many translates of @xmath0 fall completely into the @xmath42 by @xmath35 square . reducing modulo @xmath28",
    ", we obtain @xmath43diam@xmath44 and @xmath45diam@xmath41sgn@xmath46 . on the other hand @xmath36",
    "is made up of at most @xmath47 copies of @xmath17 . if we assume to the contrary that the inequalities in the hypothesis may hold , by the triangle inequality we obtain that @xmath48 or latexmath:[\\[(n+2\\mathrm{diam}(g))^{2}\\frac{\\mathrm{sgn}(\\bar{|f|})|g|-1}{|g|}\\geq    both inequalities fail to hold asymptotically for large values of @xmath35 , since the coefficients of @xmath50 on the left hand sides of the equations are strictly less than those on the right hand sides .",
    "this contradiction finishes the proof .",
    "we remark that the theorem remains valid if we replace @xmath17 by a finite collection of prototiles @xmath52 such that the inequalities hold for each of them separately .",
    "we would like to show some applications of the criterion .",
    "our first example is a certain sequence of disconnected polyominoes .",
    "we define a sequence @xmath53 of polyominoes as follows : @xmath53 is obtained by aligning @xmath28 dominoes horizontally along their longer sides , leaving a spacing of one square between any two consecutive dominoes ( see figure [ fig : dn ] ) . for instance",
    ", an accordingly positioned @xmath53 would occupy the squares @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is a domino itself .",
    "therefore it tiles the plane in many ways .",
    "the question for @xmath56 has the following answer :    @xmath53 tiles the plane iff @xmath57 , translations and rotations allowed .",
    "* proof : * examples of tilings for @xmath58 and @xmath59 are shown in figures [ fig : d2 ] and [ fig : d3 ] respectively .",
    "both tilings are doubly periodic , thus only one fundamental region is shown in either case .",
    "we must remark that a tiling pattern for @xmath58 or @xmath59 needs to obey severe restrictions , and our guess is that the @xmath59 tiling is essentially unique .",
    "next we prove the impossibility part of the assertion .",
    "suppose that @xmath60 represents the @xmath61 by @xmath61 square polyomino .",
    "it is not hard to check that @xmath62 for any value of @xmath28 ( see figure [ fig : sd3 ] ) .",
    "this happens since all but 6 translates of @xmath60 meet @xmath53 in an even number of squares .",
    "the 6 are those where @xmath63 meets the first or last square of @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , by theorem [ thm : main ] , @xmath53 can not tile the plane if @xmath65 :    let @xmath66 represent the polyomino obtained by aligning @xmath28 horizontal bars of length @xmath67 , leaving a spacing of @xmath68 blank squares between any two consecutive bars ( therefore , the @xmath53 above are @xmath69 with this notation ) . then , if @xmath70 is not divisible by @xmath67 , @xmath66 can not tile the plane if @xmath71 .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath72 represent the square polyomino of side length @xmath73",
    ". then @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "thus the inequality follows from the theorem unless @xmath76 is @xmath25 modulo @xmath67 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath51    next , we consider some rookwise connected polyominoes .",
    "all such polyominoes of area 6 or less tile the plane ( @xcite ) , so we have to consider larger polyominoes .",
    "the first polyomino in figure [ fig : tile1 ] is a 9-omino that clearly does nt tile .",
    "this is provable by our criterion as well , as demonstrated in the same figure .",
    "figure [ fig : tile4 ] shows another non - tiler , and this is also easy to prove directly .",
    "we will call a polyomino @xmath78 a `` log '' if it is an @xmath67 by @xmath68 rectangle with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the @xmath82 by @xmath83 rectangle containing @xmath78 in the middle .",
    "we define a `` log with spikes '' ( or a `` spiky log '' ) to be a polyomino obtainable from such an @xmath78 by adjoining a number of 1 by 1 squares directly to @xmath78 ( each sharing an edge with a square of @xmath78 ) so that there are at least two blank squares between any two of them ( around corners , count along the squares of @xmath84 ) .",
    "we call the 1 by 1 squares `` spikes '' .",
    "no log with more than four spikes ( moreover , no finite collection of such prototiles ) can tile the plane .",
    "* proof : * convolve the polyomino with the x pentomino modulo 2 .",
    "one may verify that convolving an @xmath67 by @xmath68 rectangle with the x pentomino gives a polyomino of norm @xmath85 , and each spike placed on the log reduces the norm of the result by 1 , while increasing the norm of the initial object by 1 .",
    "therefore , if 5 or more spikes are placed , the convolution is norm decreasing .",
    "( see the example in figure [ fig : tile3])@xmath86    we call a polyomino a `` snake '' if no subset of its squares is a t tetromino or a square tetromino .",
    "we say that the snake makes @xmath28 `` u - turns '' if it has @xmath28 distinct subsets forming u - pentominoes .",
    "no snake making 3 or more u - turns ( moreover , no finite collection of such prototiles ) can tile the plane .",
    "* proof : * convolve the polyomino with the x pentomino modulo 3 and look at the @xmath87 norm . except for the two squares at the ends ,",
    "each square of the snake has three neighbors ( counting the square itself ) , so these do not contribute .",
    "the squares at the ends may contribute 4 in total at most .",
    "any square not on the snake makes a contribution only if it shares an edge with the snake .",
    "if the snake has @xmath28 squares , the maximum possible total contribution of this type is the number of edges , @xmath88 . every u - turn costs 3 , therefore if there are more than 2 u - turns , the norm of the convolution is less than @xmath89 , and the criterion gives the result .",
    "@xmath86    golomb defines a `` reptile '' to be a polyomino that tiles a larger copy of itself @xcite .",
    "all reptiles tile the plane",
    ". therefore snakes making 3 u - turns ( actually even 2 u - turns ) can not be reptiles !",
    "there are several other sufficient criteria to prove the impossibility of tiling a given figure by another . of these ,",
    "perhaps the best known are coloring and generalized coloring arguments .",
    "one may ask where our criterion stands .",
    "we show that there exist tiling problems such that the impossibility is detected by our criterion whereas no generalized coloring argument can do so .",
    "we follow the method in @xcite .",
    "if a generalized coloring argument proves impossibility of tiling @xmath90 with @xmath0 , then it also proves impossibility of a `` signed tiling '' of @xmath90 with @xmath0 . a signed tiling permits using the map @xmath91 as well as @xmath0 , and",
    "of course , overlaps allowed .",
    "\\(i ) it is not possible to tile a torus by @xmath92 s .",
    "\\(ii ) there exist signed tilings of a @xmath93 by @xmath94 torus by @xmath92 s .",
    "* proof : * ( i ) is clear . if @xmath92 tiled a torus , it would tile the plane in a doubly periodic way .",
    "but this was shown not to happen .",
    "\\(ii ) notice that @xmath0 superposed with @xmath91 shifted @xmath61 squares to the right gives a map @xmath17 such that @xmath95 , and @xmath25 otherwise . horizontally , stack @xmath96 @xmath17 s , with a shift of two squares between consecutive @xmath17 s .",
    "we obtain a new map @xmath21 such that @xmath97 for @xmath98 , @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and @xmath25 otherwise .",
    "rotate @xmath21 @xmath101 degrees clockwise .",
    "next , stack @xmath94 @xmath92 s vertically .",
    "we get a figure of @xmath102 rectangles of dimensions @xmath94 by @xmath103 , longer sides vertical , with one horizontal separation between neighboring rectangles . using copies of @xmath21",
    ", we can shift the @xmath103nd and @xmath102th rectangles up by @xmath94 spaces while leaving the other two untouched .",
    "a horizontal stack of three copies of this final figure gives a torus tiling . @xmath86",
