    "a jacobi diagram is a uni - trivalent graph with some extra structure .",
    "such diagrams play a leading role in the theory of vassiliev invariants and kontsevich invariants of knots .",
    "vassiliev invariants are defined by a filtration of the vector space spanned by knots , whose graded spaces are identified with vector spaces spanned by jacobi diagrams subject to certain defining relations .",
    "the kontsevich invariant of a knot is defined as an infinite linear sum of jacobi diagrams .",
    "the physical background of these invariants is in the perturbative expansion of the chern ",
    "simons path integral , which is formulated in terms of uni - trivalent graphs ; this is one explanation why jacobi diagrams appear in this theory .",
    "the kontsevich invariant is expected to classify knots , and from this point of view it is important to identify the vector space spanned by jacobi diagrams subject to the defining relations .",
    "it is conjectured that the space of jacobi diagrams with an odd number of legs vanishes ; @xcite .",
    "this would imply the claim that no vassiliev invariant can distinguish a knot from its inverse , where the _ inverse _ of an oriented knot is the knot with the opposite orientation .",
    "in general , a knot and its inverse are not isotopic , the simplest counter - example being the knot @xmath1 with its two possible orientations .",
    "the consequences of the possibility that vassiliev invariants can not make this distinction are discussed in @xcite . for the lie algebra version of this claim , see remark [ rem.q_inv ] .",
    "dasbach claimed to have proved the vanishing of @xmath2loop jacobi diagrams with an odd number of legs for @xmath3 , but his proof has a gap for @xmath4 ; see remark [ rem.dasbach_gap ] .    in the present paper ,",
    "we prove the vanishing of @xmath0loop jacobi diagrams with an odd number of legs ( theorem [ thm.main ] ) . in our proof , we consider the internal graph of a jacobi diagram , which is the trivalent graph obtained from the jacobi diagram by removing its legs , where a leg of a jacobi diagram is an edge adjacent to a univalent vertex .",
    "then , following nakatsuru @xcite , we identify each jacobi diagram with a polynomial whose variables correspond to the edges of the internal graph of the jacobi diagram , and present the space of @xmath0loop jacobi diagrams as a quotient space of a direct sum of polynomial algebras corresponding to @xmath0loop internal graphs . here",
    ", the quotient is derived from the defining relations of jacobi diagrams and from the symmetries of the internal graphs .",
    "thus , the proof is reduced to calculating the image of the relations by the ( skew ) symmetrizer corresponding to the internal graph s symmetry .",
    "this approach provides in passing an alternative proof of ( * ? ? ?",
