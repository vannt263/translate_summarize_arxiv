    "the criterion used to isolate c  binaries involves the difference between the star s absolute magnitude derived from the _ hipparcos _ parallax and the johnson @xmath4  magnitude , @xmath5 , and the absolute magnitude computed from the dereddened  color index @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( the computation of @xmath7 utilizes the algorithm based on moon 1985 , moon &  dworetsky 1985 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig - knm ] compares tangential velocity dispersion of the single f  stars , known unresolved binaries , and c binaries , revealing a dramatic difference between the three populations .",
    "first , the known binary f  stars have significantly smaller velocity dispersions at all distances from the sun .",
    "the latter fact rules out a possible selection bias against distant binaries as a cause of the kinematic differences between the three populations . as seen in table  1 ,",
    "the difference in spatial velocity dispersion is even more dramatic .",
    "we have checked if the sample color selection criterion , @xmath25 , introduces a bias favoring hotter binaries and/or cooler single stars , which could make the sample binary stars younger just because of different age sampling at different effective temperatures . such a bias can arise if , for whatever reasons , binaries are hotter than single stars at the same @xmath26 color",
    ". if this is the case , the relationship between the effective temperature , @xmath27 ( derived from spectroscopic analysis ) , and @xmath26 must be different for the binaries and the single stars .",
    "this is tested in figure  [ fig - tef ] , where @xmath27 is from cayrel de strobel et al .",
    "comparison of the upper and lower panels shows that within the uncertainties the two relationships are identical , which rules out any age bias associated with the color selection criterion . among other",
    "known selection effects none was found to introduce a bias favoring low - velocity binary stars .",
    "so , the kinematic discrepancy between the known binaries and the single stars in figure  [ fig - knm ] must be intrinsic .    for the stellar populations in the solar neighborhood",
    ", smaller velocity dispersion implies younger age .",
    "therefore , the above result means that the known binary f  stars are , on average , younger than single f  stars .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by the respective discrepancy in the mean metallicity of the two populations .",
    "figure  [ fig - feh ] shows that the binary stars are , on average , more metal rich , implying that they are statistically younger than single stars . as with the kinematics ,",
    "the difference in metallicity is present at all distances , and none of the known selection effects was found to introduce a bias favoring metal rich binary stars .",
    "this argues that the metallicity difference and the corresponding age discrepancy between the known binaries and the single stars are real .",
    "if the population of known binaries is indeed younger than that of single f  stars , the questions is : why ?",
    "an obvious place to look for an answer is the interaction of the binary components .",
    "depending on separation , the components of close binaries can strongly interact with each other , including mass loss and/or mass transfer , which drastically changes their evolution .",
    "the interaction effects are believed to make the cm diagrams of star clusters look much different from what is expected on the basis of the standard stellar evolution theory as applied to a coeval population of single stars ( see , e.g. , pols &  marinus 1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "so , it would be natural to associate the younger , on average , age of the binary f  stars with the interaction of binary components in tight pairs , which somehow reduces the main sequence lifetime of the primary component .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by figure  [ fig - i1i2mh ] , which provides evidence that component separation is relevant to how long the primary star may live on the ms .",
    "figure  [ fig - i1i2mh ] compares the velocity dispersions of the spatially resolved binary f  stars ( in fact , these are the binary components having individual entries in the _ hipparcos _ catalog ) with those of the unresolved double stars .",
    "statistically , the spatially resolved binary pairs have obviously wider separations than the unresolved binaries . therefore ,",
    "if there is any impact of component interaction on stellar evolution , it must be less significant among the resolved binaries , so the populations of resolved and unresolved binaries must exhibit statistical differences arising from different stellar evolution in wide and tight binary pairs .",
    "figure  [ fig - i1i2mh ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "the kinematics of the unresolved binaries turns out to be younger ( smaller velocity dispersion ) than that of the resolved binaries at any distance from the sun , indicating that binary pairs with smaller component have shorter lifetimes .",
    "a crude estimate of the age difference between the binary and single f  stars can be obtained using age ",
    "velocity relation ( avr ) . to illustrate this , we have derived the avr for the subsample of f  stars constrained to the range of @xmath12 shown by the best known single stars within 25  pc , @xmath28 , and metallicity range @xmath29}$}\\ } \\leq 0.01 $ ] .",
    "the isochrones for isochrone fitting are from demarque et al .",
    "1996 , for the composition matching the metallicity range of the selected stars : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "this avr is shown in figure  [ fig - avr ] .",
    "the slope of the linear regression in figure  [ fig - avr ] indicates that a 1  difference in tangential velocity dispersion , @xmath32 , corresponds to a @xmath33  gyr difference in average age .",
    "the unresolved binaries have @xmath32 about @xmath34  smaller than @xmath32 of the single stars ( table  1 ) , which means that they are statistically _ younger _ by at least @xmath35  gyr .",
    "in contrast to the known binaries , the c  binaries turn out to be kinematically _ older _ than the single f  stars . one can infer this from figure  [ fig - knm ] and table  1 , where higher velocity dispersions of the c  binaries indicate older age . from the slope of the avr in figure  [ fig - avr ] and the average difference in tangential velocity dispersions of @xmath35  ( table  1 )",
    ", we conclude , that the age difference between the two population is @xmath35  gyr .",
    "there is evidence that the older age of c  binaries is associated with retarded stellar evolution of a primary f  star in a binary system , with @xmath12 being a measure of retardation ( suchkov 1999 ) ; the retardation probably results from component interaction in tight binary pairs , which is suggested by a strong correlation between @xmath12 and binary components separation found for known binaries .",
    "however , if c  binaries are double star systems similar to known binaries , the question is , why they evolve differently .",
    "we believe that the solution to this puzzle will eventually be found in the details of interaction in tight binary pairs",
    ". the outcome of the binary components interaction in terms of its impact on stellar evolution should depend on the combination of the binary system parameters , such as the component mass ratio , separation , orbit eccentricity , etc .",
    "it seems plausible that depending on that combination , the interaction of binary components can alter the standard evolution of the main sequence primary either by affecting the hydrogen - burning core and prolonging the star s main sequence lifetime , as implied in some scenarios of blue straggler formation ( cf .",
    "wheeler 1979 ; see also livio 1991 ) , or by various mass loss / transfer events that interrupt the normal main sequence evolution ( e.g. , pols &  marinus 1994 ) or both .",
    "the old age of c  binaries suggests that the former mechanism statistically dominates the evolution of these stars .",
    "one can speculate that this is because the secondary in many of these systems is probably too small ( substellar ) to evoke appreciable mass loss / transfer but is very close to the primary to tidally induce instabilities leading to enhanced internal mixing , which provides a fresh supply of hydrogen to the core .",
    "in the case of known binaries , both components are stellar , so both of the above mechanisms can operate in these systems .",
    "this means that although stellar evolution in a tight pair can be slower , the primary can prematurely cease to exist as a main sequence f  star because of a strong mass loss occurring at some point in the evolution of the binary .",
    "in fact , the latter scenario predicts that the known binaries with far evolved primaries should be , on average , older than expected from the standard stellar evolution models .",
    "this prediction can be verified by comparing velocity dispersions of binaries with different @xmath12 . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath12 appears to provide a measure of stellar evolution retardation .",
    "the larger @xmath12 the larger amount of extra time spent by the star on the main sequence , so the stars with large @xmath12 must be statistically older than those with small @xmath12 .",
    "this seems to be indeed the case .",
    "based on the age ",
    "velocity relation in figure  [ fig - avr ] , the difference in tangential velocity dispersion of @xmath36  between the two groups of known binaries ( see table  1 ) implies that those with a strong signature of retardation , @xmath10 , are older ( statistically ) by @xmath35  gyr , this discrepancy is an indicator that such a primary evolves at a much slower pace than expected , so the standard isochrones underestimate its age . ] .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the populations of binary and single f  stars do not belong to the same statistical ensemble .",
    "the main difference is in the mean age of the populations , which has important implications for the modeling of both stellar evolution and galactic evolution ."
