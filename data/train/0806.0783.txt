    "the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability is a fluid - mixing mechanism occurring when a heavy , denser , fluid is pushed into a lighter one . for a fluid in a gravitational field",
    ", such a mechanism was first discovered by lord rayleigh in the 1880s @xcite and later applied to all accelerated fluids by sir geoffrey taylor in 1950 @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this mixing mechanism embraces many different phenomena occurring in completely different contexts .",
    "we just mention , among the many , astrophysical supernova explosions and geophysical formations like salt domes and volcanic islands @xcite , continental magmatism caused by lithospheric gravitational instability @xcite , inertial confinement fusion @xcite and cloud formation in atmospheric sciences @xcite .",
    "+ back to classical fluids applications , rt instability is the first step eventually leading to a fully developed turbulent regime .",
    "a deeper understanding of the mechanism of flows driven by rt instability thus would shed light on the many processes that underpin fully developed turbulence .",
    "the difficulty inherent in sustaining an unstable density stratification has challenged experimentalists for over half a century .",
    "several innovative approaches have been recently developed ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ with the advent of supercomputers , high - resolution numerical simulations of rt at high reynolds numbers have become a reality .",
    "however , simulations using many different benchmark codes and experiments disagree already on apparently innocent observables like , for instance , the value of the growth constant , @xmath0 , associated to the spread of the turbulent mixing zone ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the differences can be as high as @xmath1 .    despite the long history of rt turbulence",
    ", a consistent phenomenological theory has been presented only very recently by @xcite for the miscible case .",
    "the theoretical predictions by chertkov have been verified by @xcite exploiting numerical simulations in two spatial dimensions .",
    "for the three - dimensional miscible case we refer , e.g , to @xcite . in many of the aforementioned situations where the rt instability has an important role , the two fluids are immiscible owing to a non negligible surface tension . at level of linear analysis the role played by a non zero surface tension was addressed by @xcite .",
    "the successive dynamics falling in a turbulent regime has been recently analyzed by @xcite . using a phenomenological approach , the authors suggest the existence of a kolmogorov cascade between the integral scale and a time - dependent scale related to the typical drop size .",
    "below the latter scale , associated to an emulsion - like region , a wave energy cascade takes in .",
    "this is mediated by weakly interacting capillary waves propagating on top of the drop surface .",
    "eventually , the energy is dissipated by viscous forces .",
    "+ rt instability and rt turbulence of immiscible fluids thus appear richer than the corresponding miscible situations .",
    "the existence of two different cascades poses a serious challenge to numerical investigations of the immiscible rt problems .",
    "the emulsion - like phase indeed occurs at very small scales and the energy transfer takes place on the interfaces .",
    "these are geometrical objects close to singularities and thus difficult to describe appropriately in a numerical scheme .",
    "accuracy and efficiency are thus fundamental requirements to reproduce the correct statistical features characterizing immiscible rt turbulence .",
    "our aim here is to perform a first step along this direction by focusing on direct numerical simulations of immiscible rt instability .",
    "the numerical strategy we exploit here is known as phase - field model @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the method is to treat the interface between two immiscible fluids as a thin mixing layer across which physical properties vary steeply but continuously .",
    "the evolution of the mixing layer is ruled by an order parameter ( the phase field ) that obeys a cahn - hilliard equation @xcite .",
    "the method permits to avoid a direct tracking of the interface and easily produces the correct interfacial tension from the mixing layer free energy .",
    "we present here an accurate numerical study that validates the phase ",
    "field approach by testing known results of immiscible rt instability both at level of linear and weakly nonlinear analysis . from our results",
    ", it turns out that this strategy is a valuable option for a quantitative treatment of the turbulent regime characterized by the interplay between hydrodynamic and interface degrees of freedom .",

    "[ pfm ] we introduce the rayleigh  taylor problem and discuss the related phase - field approach .",
    "a detailed analysis of the energy balance between purely hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and interface degrees of freedom is presented .",

    "[ num ] the results from the direct numerical simulations are presented and compared with known results for the linear analysis .",

    "finally , the weakly nonlinear regime is considered and the resulting terminal velocity of bubbles / spikes compared with existing theoretical predictions .",
    "[ conclu ] is devoted to some conclusions and perspectives .",
    "our system consists of two immiscible , incompressible fluids ( labeled by 1 and 2 ) having different densities , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the denser fluid placed , e.g. , above the less dense one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluids ] ) .",

    ", surface tension may be able to keep the system in equilibrium , provided the density contrast is not too large .",
    "+ let us start by describe the equilibrium configuration and then pass to the evolution ( rt instability ) that occurs when a perturbation is imposed to the interface separating the two fluids .",
    "let us consider an equilibrium state where fluid 1 is placed below fluid 2 and they are separated by a sharp interface .",
    "the fact that the interface is sharp ( i.e. a discontinuity in the fluid properties ) poses a serious challenge to numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , for sharp interfaces , the evolution equations are obtained by following fluid 1 and 2 separately with the appropriate boundary condition at interface ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other approaches follow the interface alone . in this latter case ,",
    "the movement of the interface is naturally amenable to a lagrangian description , while the bulk flow is conventionally solved in an eulerian framework .",
    "these approaches employ a mesh that has grid points on the interfaces and deforms according to the flow .",
    "a major shortcoming of these approaches is in that they can not handle properly topological changes such as breakup , coalescence and reconnections ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this respect ,",
    "the phase ",
    "field method is , by far and large , more effective , at the expense of a larger number of grid points required .",
    "the idea of the phase ",
    "field method is to replace the sharp interface with a diffuse one in such a way that the numerical computation of interface movement and deformation can be carried out on fixed grids @xcite .",

    "+ the equilibrium state is the minimizer of the free energy @xmath6 .",
    "the mechanism which keeps the system in this configuration is the competition between two effects due to the two addends in .",
    "the first term favours a perfect mixing ( i.e. @xmath14 in @xmath6 , this term being the interface energy contribution ) whereas the second one one drives the system towards demixing ( the associated term in @xmath6 , the bulk contribution , has indeed a minimum for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the nontrivial final equilibrium state is just the results of this competition .",
    "more quantitatively , the final state is obtained by minimizing the free - energy functional with respect to variations of the function @xmath7 ,",

    "one immediately realizes that the sharp - interface limit is obtained for @xmath20 : in this case @xmath21 .",
