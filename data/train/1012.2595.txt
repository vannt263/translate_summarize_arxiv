    "the skyrme - faddeev model is a @xmath0-dimension modified @xmath4-sigma model @xcite .",
    "this theory has finite - energy string - like solutions and has a potential application as a low energy effective theory of qcd @xcite .",
    "the theory usually has two components , a sigma term which is a quadratic of derivatives and a skyrme term which is quartic in derivatives .",
    "these are the minimum terms required to provide a scale for derricks theorem , @xcite , in @xmath0-dimensional flat space .",
    "the theory is described by the lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a three component unit vector , @xmath7 . at fixed time @xmath6",
    "is the map @xmath8 .",
    "a condition for finite energy solutions of is that the field must tend to a constant value at spatial infinity , which we select to be @xmath9 for all time , @xmath10 .",
    "this allows a one - point compactification of the domain , @xmath11 .",
    "so static , finite - energy , solutions are a map @xmath12 this map , , belongs to an equivalence class characterised by the homotopy group @xmath13 .",
    "this shows that there is an integer topological invariant associated with @xmath6 , known as the hopf invariant . in this case",
    "we will refer to the hopf invariant as the topological charge @xmath14 .",
    "+ the topological charge can be found by firstly defining an area form @xmath15 on @xmath16 .",
    "then we can define @xmath17 , which is the pull - back of @xmath15 by @xmath6 . due to the second cohomology group of the three sphere being trivial , @xmath18 ,",
    "all closed forms on @xmath19 are exact forms .",
    "therefore , we can now re - define the exact form @xmath20 by the @xmath21-form @xmath22 as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore we can express the topological charge , @xmath14 , as @xmath24 this non - local definition of the topological charge , , is not particularly useful in this context .",
    "instead the topological charge of can be found as the linking number of loops in the domain .",
    "these loops are formed as preimages of two distinct points on the target space .",
    "for example if we define the two curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the preimages of the points @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if we then choose a smooth surface @xmath29 , with a boundary @xmath25 , the linking is defined as @xmath30 where the @xmath31 refers to the relative orientations of @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",
    "this definition of the topological invariant can be shown to be the same as , @xcite . + there is a well known lower bound on the energy , @xcite , which is based on an involved argument using sobolev - type inequalities , @xmath32 the fractional power of",
    "is proven to be optimal , but the value of @xmath33 might not be .",
    "ward , @xcite , was motivated by his study of the skyrme - faddeev theory on a unit three - sphere to propose that @xmath34 might be a more optimal value .",
    "+ the hopfion location is commonly defined as the curve @xmath35 , which is the antipodal value to the boundary vacuum value .",
    "+ for @xmath2 there have been many extensive and detailed investigations into the static minimum energy solutions of , @xcite . for charges",
    "one to seven it is believed their respective global minimum energy solutions have all been identified .",
    "it is known @xcite for topological charges one to three that the minimum energy solutions have a planar loop location curve .",
    "topological charges five and six have the minimum energy solutions of two linked hopfions @xcite . for topological charge seven",
    "the minimum energy location curve is a trefoil knot @xcite . in @xcite sutcliffe",
    "devised a new knotted rational map ansatz as initial conditions .",
    "these initial conditions were then energetically minimised to give new minimum energy solution candidates for a large class of topological charges .",
    "we shall describe and make use of this technique later .",
    "the actual model of interest here is a modification of the usual skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "it is modified by an additional potential term , so @xmath36 in and @xmath37 this choice of potential , , is not general but is one of the simplest choices",
    ". a potential term , which breaks global @xmath1 symmetry , is also generated on derivation of the theory as an infrared limit of @xmath0-dimensional @xmath38 yang - mills theory @xcite . if we restrict ourself to the plane this model reduces to the old baby skyrmion model .",
    "also this potential , , meets the finite energy criteria for the chosen boundary condition ; where the single vacuum of @xmath39 is also the chosen boundary value .",
    "the potential , , increases the energy density along the location of the hopfion .",
    "this is because the location curve , @xmath40 , corresponds to the maximum of the potential .",
    "therefore , we expect the hopfion location curve to become smaller in length for increasing @xmath41 .",
    "we also expect the hopfion string to become finer with increasing @xmath41 ; as it is analogous with the baby skyrmion model .",
    "this is best understood by an asymptotic analysis where we approximate the field for large @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 . for large @xmath42",
    "we know that , due to finite energy criteria , @xmath45 therefore the energy density associated with becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a solution of the partial differential equation @xmath48 separating @xmath47 into radial and angular components as @xmath49 . where @xmath50 is a purely radial function , @xmath51 is a spherical harmonic @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the usual spherical polar coordinates . then solving we gain an asymptotic approximation for @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a constant of integration .",
    "this shows that hopfions become increasingly exponentially located as @xmath41 increases .",
    "hence the hopfions in this massive theory will have yukawa type asymptotic tails .",
    "it is already well known that charged hopfions can be knotted objects , @xcite .",
    "one of the most effective ways to create non - trivial knotted initial conditions , to be minimised , is to use the rational map ansatz technique described in @xcite . here",
    "the author used a degree one spherically equivariant map to compactifiy @xmath57 by @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 using these complex coordinates an @xmath62-torus knot can be described as the intersection of a complex curve @xmath63 with a unit three - sphere @xcite . hence we can formulate the rational map ansatz @xmath64 the inverse stereographic projection of the curve @xmath65 produces a @xmath66 closed curve in @xmath67 .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath68 in the rational map ansatz is used to fix the boundary conditions of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we need @xmath69 so the inverse stereographic projection gives @xmath70 at the spacial boundary of @xmath67 .",
    "+ we can now formulate an axially symmetric hopfion initial condition as @xmath71 which has charge @xmath72 .",
    "these types of unlinked hopfion are labelled @xmath73 .",
    "also a hopfion , with a position curve of an @xmath62-torus knot , can be formed by the rational map ansatz @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this gives a closed curve that wraps @xmath22 and @xmath77 times about the two circumferences of a torus , @xcite , and has topological charge @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "these tours knot configurations are labelled @xmath79 . a torus knot with a reducible denominator",
    "can produce linked hopfions .",
    "for example a rational map @xmath80 forms two charged @xmath81 hopfions linked once .",
    "we label this type of configuration as @xmath82 . + this",
    "approach not only produces a non - trivial knotted location curve with an analytically known topological charge , it also gives a smooth field with the correct boundary conditions .",
    "+ to find static hopf solitons we set @xmath83 in the skyrme term of .",
    "this gives a non - relativistic theory which has the same static equations of motions as the those derived from .",
    "this greatly simplifies the corresponding equations of motion by removing a numerically cumbersome matrix inversion .",
    "it also still facilitates time evolution by the second order dynamics derived from the sigma term .",
    "the non - relativistic equation of motion can then be numerically evolved on a discrete lattice using a fourth - order derivative approximation .",
    "we also need an additional lagrangian multiplier , @xmath84 , to constrain @xmath6 to take its value on @xmath16 .",
    "if we periodically remove kinetic energy the potential energy will also become minimised ; this will yield minimum energy static solutions .",
    "this minimisation technique produces static solutions and uses much less cpu time when compared to other similar minimisation algorithms . a numerical grid of @xmath85 points , with @xmath86 ,",
    "was found to be large enough to contain the exponentially located hopfion . on this lattice",
    "the hopfion can smoothly attain the vacuum value at the boundary without a noticeable expense of energy .",
    "this lattice is also fine enough not to lose the fundamental topology .",
    "the definition of the position of a hopf soliton is sensible , but not useful for display purposes",
    ". therefore , all the images of hopf solitons in this paper are plots of an isosurface of the preimage of the curve @xmath87 in the domain .",
    "this gives a surface that is a fine tube in the physical space and produces much clearer images . to show the linking number we also need to plot the preimage of a second loop , but there is no unique loop to choose . in all the plots shown we generate general loops on the target space by choosing a point , @xmath88 , on @xmath16 .",
    "we then find the distance on the surface of @xmath16 between @xmath89 and @xmath6 .",
    "this distance is then normalised by the distance between @xmath89 and the south pole of @xmath16 , @xmath90 , as @xmath91 this gives many loops of constant radius on @xmath16 .",
    "the preimages , of these loops , are tubes of varying thickness in the domain . also , an isosurface of unitary value is known to intersect with the position curve of a hopf soliton . throughout this paper",
    "we choose @xmath92 which is an arbitrary choice for aesthetics .",
    "a hopfion initial condition , where the position curve is contained completely on a plane , can be formed by the rational map ansatz .",
    "so if we set @xmath94 in this gives the initial condition of a topological charge one hopf soliton which is located along a planar loop . using this initial condition , and the above minimisation procedure",
    ", we can find the minimum energy configurations for @xmath95 , as shown in figure [ q1-m=0to5 ] .",
    ".minimum energies for @xmath95 topological charge one hopfions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab - energy - inf - m ] shows that in this @xmath96 model the initial and final minimised location curves rarely differ .",
    "a good example of this is the @xmath97 @xmath98 trefoil knot which under minimization remains as a @xmath98 trefoil knot , but in the @xmath99 and @xmath2 models minimises to a @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath97 , @xmath101 , is also a lower energy solution for this @xmath96 model .",
    "this reluctance to deform from one location curve to another is due to the reduced self interaction of this compact hopfion model .",
    "+    we have also found a topological charge seven trefoil knot , in the @xmath96 model , which is shown in figure [ hopf - q=7-m = inf ] .",
    "for the range of topological charges we have investigated , in this @xmath96 model , we have found that the charge - specific lowest energy solutions are similar to the @xmath2 and @xmath99 models .",
    "but as in the @xmath99 model we have discovered more local minima or saddle point solutions .",
    "again , as shown in figure [ eoverevsq ] , the energy per - unit charge scales with a similar @xmath3 grows as the @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath99 models .",
    "we have explored the skyrme - faddeev model with a potential term included . we found that including a potential in the model makes the hopf solitons exponentially decay to their vacuum value .",
    "increasing the mass makes the hopf solitons string cross - section increasingly exponentially localized .",
    "we found for @xmath99 the minimum energy solutions are described by similar linking curves as the @xmath2 skyrme - faddeev model @xcite .",
    "+ using a spatial rescaling we were able to formulate an infinite mass model .",
    "this infinite mass model is known to yield compact hopfions @xcite . for this infinite mass compact model",
    "we have presented a number of topologically charged solutions .",
    "we showed that the minimum energy compact solutions have similar location curves as in the usual , @xmath2 , skyrme - faddeev model and the @xmath99 massive model . in both the @xmath99 and @xmath96 models we found new local minimum , or stationary point energetic solutions .",
    "the increasing localization of the strings in the two massive models reduces the string self interaction .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that these models possess solutions stabilised by symmetry .",
    "+ in figure [ eoverevsq ] we showed that the @xmath99 and the @xmath96 models charge - specific energies seem to grow with a similar @xmath3 trend as the @xmath2 case .",
    "therefore , approximating hopfions as kirchhoff rods @xcite could also be successful in the massive model",
