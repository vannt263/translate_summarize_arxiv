    ", the spirals can be classified into three types : excitable , oscillatory , and bistable spirals .",
    "the excitable spirals originate from the excitability of media , which have been studied widely in the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction @xcite , the cardiac tissue @xcite , and the catalytic reactions on platinum surface @xcite .",
    "the oscillatory spirals originate from the hopf bifurcation and are formed by the coupling of phase in spatial .",

    "dense and sparse spirals result from different excitabilities of media . in bistable media",
    ", dense and sparse spirals can transit each other via a subcritical bifurcation .",
    "so far , the dynamics of 1-armed spirals have been well understood .",
    "recently major progress on the spirals has involved the interaction of multi - armed spirals @xcite .",
    "this is inspired especially by the experimental observation of multi - armed spirals in a two - dimensional cardiac substrate @xcite .",
    "the behaviors of persistent multi - armed spirals are different from that of 1-armed spirals .",
    "multi - armed spirals can be formed due to attraction of several 1-armed spirals if their tips are less than one wavelength apart @xcite . in an asymmetric bound state of spiral pairs ,",
    "the faster spiral becomes the master one , and the other ( slave spiral ) can rotate around it @xcite .",
    "although the study on the interaction of multi - armed spirals has rose in the past years , it has mainly focused on the sparse spirals in excitable media .",
    "the interaction of multi - armed spirals in bistable media , for both dense and sparse configurations , is still an open question . in this work ,",
    "we first give the evolution of both dense and sparse 1-armed spirals .",

    "the front and the back correspond to the two bloch interfaces with opposite velocities .",

    "as is well known pattern formations in bistable media are related to the initial conditions besides the control parameters . in our work , we generated the multi - armed spirals by designing appropriate initial conditions and then studied their interactions .",
    "many real chemical experiments , such as the ferroin- , ru(bpy)@xmath113- , and cerium - catalyzed belousov - zhabotinsky and/or iodate - sulfite reactions , are sensitive to visible and/or ultraviolet light @xcite .",
    "therefore , light illumination has been widely used to excite desired initial conditions .",
    "for example , a couple of spirals can be generated by shadowing a small part of the propagating wave front with a mask .",
    "multi - armed spirals with corotation and independent rotation have been observed experimentally by steinbock @xcite and krinsky @xcite in excitable media .",
    "light - sensitive catalyst even makes it possible to study the image processing and the effective computational procedure for finding paths in labyrinth based on reaction - diffusion mechanisms @xcite . at present ,",
    "bistable patterns , such as the 1-armed spirals , the labyrinthine , and the breathing spots , have been studied well in iodate - sulfite reactions experimentally @xcite and in fitzhugh - nagumo model theoretically @xcite .",
    "we believe this work provide information to understand the interaction of multi - armed spiral , and hope that our results about the interaction of multi - armed spirals in bistable media can be verified in one of these light - sensitive reactions .",
