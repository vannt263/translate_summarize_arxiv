    "accurate measurement of the distances to the magellanic clouds is an important current issue as it provides a basic step toward determining the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "paczynski ( 1997 , 2000 ) has argued that eclipsing binaries now provide the most direct and accurate distances to the magellanic clouds , and examples are already in the literature ( e.g. guinan et al .",
    "1998 ; fitzpatrick et al .",
    "recently , thousands of variable stars including eclipsing binaries have been discovered by the ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) , macho ( alcock et al . 1997 ) and eros ( grison et al . 1995 ) collaborations as a by - product of galactic microlensing searches .",
    "these catalogs motivate a systematic , quantitative search for close to ideal systems for distance determination .",
    "the method of measuring distances by means of eclipsing binaries has been known for decades , and its basis has been clearly explained by paczynski ( 1997 ) and guinan , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , among others .",
    "in essence , light curves provide relative star dimensions ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is mean radius and @xmath3 is orbit size ) and radial velocities establish the absolute scale by providing the orbit size , so that one can find the @xmath2 s in physical units by combining the two kinds of information .",
    "fine effects , such as departures from sphericity , etc .",
    ", can be modeled by modern eclipsing binary light curve programs . with absolute radii known , luminosities in physical units follow if emission per unit surface area ( energy per unit area per unit time per wavelength interval ) becomes known .",
    "some persons favor calibrated relations based on interferometrically resolved , un - complicated stars for the emission measure while others favor the predictions of stellar atmosphere models that are fitted to spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of eclipsing binary distance estimation targets .",
    "emission for plane - parallel atmospheres is determined , in principle , if effective temperature , @xmath4 @xmath5 , and chemical composition are specified . for a well observed eclipsing binary ,",
    "@xmath5 is computed to better than adequate accuracy as @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be estimated by fitting a theoretical sed to an observed sed , as in fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ) . in usual practice ,",
    "surface chemical composition would be assumed normal , but that is the _ only _ normalcy assumption . the reasonableness of that assumption for _ sd _ binaries will be discussed below .",
    "the overall method is mainly geometrical , with only the emission measure involving radiative physics . it does not require knowledge of distances to calibration stars , as opposed to other standard candle methods such as by cepheid variables or supernovae , and therein lies one of the primary advantages .",
    "empirical calibration errors are bypassed if surface emission is computed from a stellar atmosphere model .",
    "although conventional wisdom holds that well - detached eclipsing binaries yield the most reliable light curve solutions , the basis for that conjecture may not extend beyond the scientific instinct that simpler is better .",
    "in fact there are real advantages to solutions of semi - detached ( hereafter _ sd _ ) and overcontact ( _ oc _ ) binary light curves , partly in the exploitation of lobe - filling configurations and partly through proximity effects , which provide information that is lacking in well - detached binaries . actually , many factors influence the relative reliability of detached , _ sd _ , and _ oc _ light curve solutions .",
    "accordingly , searches for standard candle binaries should examine all relevant considerations , including ones that argue for or against _ sd _ and _ oc _ systems . here",
    "we consider _ sd _ binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and will take up the _ oc _ case in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our aims are to discuss the main considerations that bear upon the potential usefulness of _ sd _ binaries as standard candles , to identify good _ sd _ candidates for smc distance determination via future observations with large telescopes , and to derive preliminary dimensional , radiative , and mass ratio properties of the candidates . of course , _ sd _ binaries are fascinating objects in their own right , and we expect that their identification will also lead to investigations of _ sd _ properties unrelated to distance determination .",
    "smc detached binaries were treated in wyithe & wilson  ( 2001 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is in four parts .",
    "section 2 considers potential advantages of _ sd _ binaries as standard candles .",
    "[ fit_scheme ] discusses our automated fitting scheme and differences from the scheme described in paper i for detached binaries . quite apart from the logical arguments of section 2",
    ", simulations can show statistically how well _ sd _ and detached solutions recover known parameters .",
    "this topic is discussed in sec .",
    "[ mocksec ] .",
    "we also show how in some cases the issue of whether a binary is detached or _",
    "sd _ can be determined from photometry with reasonable reliability .",
    "[ oglefits ] has solutions to the ogle catalog of eclipsing binary stars and discusses candidate _",
    "sd _ binaries .",
    "discussion of the measurement of distances to eclipsing binaries and their use as standard candles has traditionally centered around well detached systems .",
    "measurements of distances to detached binaries in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have combined a stellar surface area ( in absolute units ) computed from photometric light and radial velocity curves with a surface brightness described by a model atmosphere to compute system luminosity ( _ e.g. _ guinan , _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; fitzpatrick , _ et al .",
    "however surface brightnesses at all points over a stellar surface can be computed for nearly all classes of eclipsing binaries by combined use of modern eclipsing binary light - curve and model atmosphere programs .",
    "therefore , it is not obvious that detached systems make the best eclipsing binaries for the purpose of distance determination . indeed , as part of analyses of the fundamental parameters of _ sd _ binaries in the magellanic clouds , ostrov , lapasset , and morrell ( 2000 ; 2001 ) and ostrov ( 2001 ) have already obtained preliminary values for the distance moduli . in this section",
    "we provide a general discussion of why we believe that many _",
    "s will turn out to be excellent standard candles .",
    "of course , the use of _ sd _",
    "s for this purpose will need to be demonstrated for binaries with known distances , much as has been done in the case of detached binaries ( semeniuk 2000 ) .",
    "this discussion also motivates our work on identification of _ sd _ systems in the ogle eclipsing binary catalog in the sections that follow .",
    "one can ask if it is a problem that most _ sd _ binaries have at least one significantly evolved star . the classical algol _ sd _ binaries are abundant in the milky way and have other favorable characteristics , so we consider the question in the context of algols .",
    "an algol consists of a hot main sequence star that now is rather normal despite a history of growth by accretion , and a lobe - filling sub - giant that shows magnetic star spots and other magnetic and prominence activity , but is so dim as to contribute very little to system light .",
    "basically the sub - giant acts as a moving mask that probes the primary via eclipses ( although eclipses of the secondary by the primary also have some importance ) .",
    "the primary has regained nuclear and thermal equilibrium , following the accretion episode , and is now essentially a normal main sequence star .",
    "its composition usually is normal because the transferred gas came from the donor star s chemically normal envelope , not from it s chemically altered core",
    ". however there could be composition abnormalities in _ sd _ binaries that are not algols , and these must be dealt with in individual cases .",
    "typically there is some on - going mass transfer and emission line activity , but usually at a low level .",
    "actually it may be difficult to see the emission lines , and they usually occupy only a minute fraction of an optical bandpass . due to tidal circularization , algols and other",
    "_ sd _ s almost invariably have sensibly circular orbits , so evolution actually simplifies the standard candle problem in that regard .",
    "accordingly , the evolved status of typical algols does not disqualify them from serving as standard candles .",
    "some algols have disturbed light and radial velocity curves , but we seek only the best candidates and can discard questionable ones .",
    "_ sd _ light curves are sensitive to mass ratio , @xmath8 , thereby leading to the concept of a _ photometric mass ratio _ , @xmath9 , in contrast with well detached binaries , whose light curves can be represented by a very wide range of @xmath10 .",
    "the idea of a photometric mass ratio derives from that of limiting lobes and originated , in the _ sd _ case , with kopal ( 1954 ; 1955 ) .",
    "it works for both _",
    "s and _ oc _",
    "s , but _ does not _",
    "work for detached binaries .",
    "the history of @xmath9 for _ oc _ s is more complicated and will be discussed in our forthcoming paper on _ oc _ s .",
    "the basic explanation for _ sd _ @xmath9 begins with the concept of a limiting ( or critical ) lobe as the volume within the largest closed equipotential that surrounds a member of a binary star system .",
    "the _ sd _ condition has the photosphere of one star accurately coincident with the surface of its limiting lobe , while the other star lies within its lobe . in algols ,",
    "the condition is maintained by continual slow expansion , accompanied by loss of matter through a nozzle around the null point of effective gravity that faces the companion star .",
    "a consideration that favors _ sd _ light curve solutions is that the lobe filling condition , when correctly recognized , mathematically eliminates a parameter , as it ties the nozzle location to mass ratio .",
    "that is , _ sd _ light curves contain information as to the location of star ( and thus lobe ) surface , so the lobe filling condition connects star size with mass ratio .",
    "writing @xmath11 for ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) critical potential is a traditional dimensionless quantity that has the essential character of a potential , but differs from a true potential by an additive constant .",
    "it is defined so as not to depend on the absolute masses . ]",
    ", we have a definite relation @xmath12 . the functionality can involve more parameters in unusual cases ( _ viz_. wilson , 1979 ) , but we limit our remarks to common synchronously rotating binaries with circular orbits .",
    "naturally @xmath13 specifies the lobe filling star s size and figure .",
    "thus @xmath13 and @xmath10 become functionally related in a known way and the _ sd _ condition compresses the parameter space by an entire dimension . of course elimination of a parameter",
    "will strengthen a solution by simplifying the parameter correlation matrix .",
    "the corresponding intuitive explanation for _ oc _ s is best given somewhat differently , but formally is the same - a functional relation eliminates one parameter dimension ( _ viz .",
    "_ wilson , 1994 for fuller explanations of the _ sd _ and _ oc _ cases ) .",
    "we mention a common mis - understanding , that @xmath9 mainly derives from ellipsoidal variation ( brightness undulation due to tidal distortion ) - a notion that is essentially entirely wrong .",
    "it is the _ size _ of the lobe filling star , not its figure , that leads to @xmath14 actually very little ellipsoidal variation is seen in most algol light curves because the tidally distorted secondaries are very dim , yet @xmath9 s are found routinely and accurately for algols .",
    "in addition to overall solidification of solutions by the lobe filling condition , absolute star dimensions and masses can be found for _ sd _",
    "s having only single - lined spectra .",
    "armed with knowledge of @xmath10 from one or more light curves and of orbital semi - major axis @xmath15 from star 1 velocities , we trivially compute @xmath16 without need for velocities of star 2 .",
    "that point is particularly important for algols , most of which have dim secondaries and therefore have spectra that are usually single - lined .",
    "although not often available , a velocity curve for star 2 provides a check on @xmath9 . a simultaneous light and double - lined velocity solution can extract consensus information ( wilson 1979 ) and solidify the solution .",
    "systems with double - lined spectra may provide the best results , but the existence of @xmath9 means that we are _ not dependent _ on double - lined spectroscopy .    as mentioned in the introduction the surface brightness , needed to compute luminosity and hence distance ,",
    "can be computed either from calibrated relations ( based on interferometrically resolved , un - complicated stars ) or from the predictions of stellar atmosphere models that are fitted to binary sed s .",
    "an important distinction is that if one requires empirically calibrated stellar surface brightnesses , then attention must be limited to cases of well detached binaries containing undistorted _ normal _ stars .",
    "however , the use of stellar atmosphere models removes this restriction , and enables the use of binaries containing evolved and/or tidally distorted stars , and hence the harnessing of the better constrained solutions offered by _ sd",
    "_ binaries .",
    "evidence of the applicability of stellar atmosphere models was provided by ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who simultaneously solved for component temperatures , metalicity and surface gravities as well as interstellar reddening ( using the scheme of fitzpatrick & massa , 1999 ) as part of a measurement of the distance to hv  2274 in the lmc .",
    "ribas , _ et al .",
    "_ found a surface gravity in good agreement with that from their simultaneous light - velocity solution with the wilson - devinney model , and metalicities in good agreement with those for the lmc , which lends confidence that the method is working correctly .",
    "another point to be taken into account is that completely eclipsing ( _ i.e_. total - annular ) systems give much better results than partially eclipsing ones , basically because there is little tradeoff between inclination and other parameters for complete eclipses .",
    "also , a _ moderate luminosity ratio _ helps in two ways - by improving the quality of ( and chances for ) secondary star velocities and by making the secondary eclipse reasonably deep . _ moderate mass ratios _ are good in that they produce reasonably large primary star velocity amplitudes .    in summary , this section discussed the value of _ sd _ binaries as standard candles , where important advantages are that a light curve can tell the mass ratio , that light curve solutions involve one fewer parameter than do detached solutions , and that circular orbits are the rule .",
    "knowledge of @xmath9 allows full absolute dimensions ( and masses ) to be derived for a binary with _ single - lined _ spectra , in contrast with the detached case , where double - lined spectra are necessary . in cases",
    "where the spectra are double - lined , redundancy in the determination of the mass ratio will further strengthen solutions .",
    "there is a downside in the case of common algols : although velocity curves for the primaries should be measurable ( it is by far the brighter component ) , the curves will have small amplitude because star 1 is much the more massive component .",
    "thus the principal observational need is outstandingly accurate radial velocities . for the smc ,",
    "that requirement involves large telescope aperture and an excellent radial velocity spectrograph but it can be done , especially if _ large numbers _ of velocities are measured so as to average out the noise .",
    "the problem of small primary velocities does not apply to all _ sd _ s , and not even to all algols , but does apply to most of the common algols .",
    "the advantages mentioned above relate to the potential improvement of light - curve solutions and corresponding distance determinations from _ sd _ binaries relative to detached binaries .",
    "_ sd _ s usually have comparatively robust solutions with smaller parameter uncertainties , an outcome that should lead to more accurate distance estimates and provide motivation to identify candidates in survey data - the subject of the remainder of this paper .",
    "we shall learn about other advantages from the simulations of sec .",
    "[ mocksec ] that relate to the _ identification _ of candidates for detailed follow up observation .",
    "these include reduced incidence of false solutions with reversed primary and secondary radii that lead to incorrect initial estimates of luminosity ratios ( thereby wrongly predicting whether spectra are double or single - lined ) , and improved identification of complete eclipses .",
    "furthermore , we shall show that observation of _ sd _ binaries will be a relatively efficient use of resources due to reliable initial determination of system properties .",
    "in the interest of completeness , we outline the automation procedure that was fully described in paper i and is built around public light curve ( _ lc _ ) and differential corrections ( _ dc _ ) fortran programs ( wilson and devinney , 1971 ; wilson , 1979 , 1990 , 1998 ; hereafter wd program or wd model ) .",
    "_ lc _ computes light and radial velocity curves and also spectral line profiles and images of binary stars , including effects of tides , mutual irradiation , spots , eccentric orbits , and other effects .",
    "star surfaces are specified in terms of equipotentials .",
    "_ dc _ accepts observed data and parameter estimates and computes corrections to the estimates according to the least squares criterion .",
    "the distributed version of _ dc _ does only one iteration per submission so as to ensure human interaction in the progress of a solution .",
    "the automation shell that renders processing of thousands of binaries practical is a perl script that loops the _ dc _ iterations , tests for proper convergence , and generates light curves with _ lc_. the _ lc _ and _ dc _ programs work in eight operational modes that mainly relate to morphology , with detached , _ sd _ , _ oc _ , etc .",
    "configurations represented by corresponding modes . here",
    "we use only mode 2 ( detached ) , where there is no constraint on the surface potentials , and mode 5 ( _ sd _ ) , where the secondary star potential is required to be exactly that of the lobe .",
    "initial parameter estimates are those of the best match in a pre - computed library of light curves , with separate libraries for modes 2 and 5 .",
    "naturally the actual time scale is likely to need some shifting to optimize a match with a given binary , whether it be synthesized or real ( from ogle ) . as in paper",
    "i , we begin by adjusting the reference epoch ( @xmath17 ) while keeping the udalski et al . period .",
    "we then compare a given observed light curve with each one in the appropriate library of simulated systems to find the closest least squares match .",
    "the flux scale is controlled by @xmath18 , the bandpass luminosity of star 1 , which acts only as a scaling factor because fluxes are not on an absolute scale at this stage of analysis .    our basic strategy for _ sd _ s differs from that for detached binaries : instead of entering a _ fixed _ @xmath10 and relying on the fact that detached light - curves are insensitive to @xmath10 , we _ solve _ for @xmath10 in the _ sd _ case",
    ". converged parameters for _ sd _ binaries are @xmath19 (  potential  ) , @xmath20 ( mean surface temperature ) , @xmath21 ( inclination ) , @xmath10 , and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath22 ( orbital eccentricity ) are adjusted but convergence of these parameters is not a solution requirement .",
    "@xmath22 is expected to be 0 for _ sd _ systems , and is adjusted in the interest of experimentation . @xmath23 ( the argument of periastron ) is distributed between 0 and @xmath24 , but is fixed at the value of the initial guess .",
    "of course , @xmath25 is set by @xmath10 for _ sd _ systems .",
    "for detached solutions , which we need for comparison purposes , @xmath25 is a parameter but @xmath10 is not , as @xmath10 can not ordinarily be found for detached solutions ( _ viz .",
    "_ paper i for remarks on experiences with convergence of mode 2 solutions ) .",
    "detached systems can have larger @xmath22 s , and we found that more accurate solution parameters were obtained where @xmath23 was restricted to 0 or @xmath24 .    _",
    "dc _ convergence is improved by application of the well known levenberg - marquardt scheme ( levenberg , 1944 ; marquardt , 1963 ) with factor @xmath26 , and also by the method of multiple subsets ( mms , wilson and biermann , 1976 ) .",
    "iterations ended when all corrections to parameters for which convergence was required were below 0.2 times the standard errors from auxiliary solutions of the full parameter set .",
    "there were two _ groupings _ of subsets , with the second grouping as back - up in case the first grouping failed to converge or led to an unphysical solution .",
    "s , where eccentric orbits are a rarity , another two subset groupings were used as back up . using this second pair @xmath22 was fixed at the value of the initial guess in addition to fixing @xmath23 .",
    "the subset groups are summarized in tab .",
    "[ t1 ] for both _ sd _ and detached systems .",
    "the method for finding _ sd _",
    "solutions for eclipsing binaries in the smc is similar to that for the detached binaries of paper i , but with some differences . by far",
    "the most important difference is that we constrain one star to be in accurate contact with its limiting lobe , and accordingly can learn @xmath10 from a well conditioned light curve . phasing , weighting , limb darkening , and radiative physics",
    "are handled in the way of paper i , while the manner of treating mass ratio is changed , as is that of handling the lobe configuration .",
    "briefly , phasing has star 1 eclipsed near phase zero ( where we ordinarily find the deeper eclipse ) , weighting assumes that scatter scales with the square root of light level , and limb darkening has @xmath27 with @xmath28 the cosine of the angle from the surface normal .",
    "intensities @xmath29 are averages over the photometric",
    "_ i_-band ( the most extensive ogle light - curves were observed in _",
    "i_-band ) .",
    "limb darkening coefficients @xmath30 were fitted to kurucz  ( 1991 ) model stellar atmospheres by van hamme ( 1993 ) .",
    "colors reported by udalski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) indicate typical spectral types of o and b. however only relative temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath32 matter for single band light curves so we assumed fixed @xmath32 s of @xmath33 ( with the black body radiation law ) and allowed the program to find the @xmath31 s .",
    "limb darkening is demonstrably unimportant for noisy light curves so we assumed @xmath34 and @xmath35 for all binaries , with the numbers from van hamme  ( 1993 ) for @xmath36 and the _ i _ band .",
    "the model can do either a simple or a detailed reflection computation ( wilson  1990 ) . to reduce computing time , we chose the simple law ( mref=1 ) , which should be thoroughly adequate here .",
    "bolometric albedos were unity and the stars were assumed to rotate synchronously and had no spots .",
    "although low temperature algol type secondaries will have convective envelopes and consequently have low albedos of @xmath37 ( rucinski , 1969 ) , assignment of albedos on a case by case basis can be done later , for solutions of accurate future light curves .",
    "the treatment of orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron is somewhat problematic and was discussed in paper i for the detached case .",
    "all _ sd _ solutions for ogle binaries that were finally accepted have @xmath22 s consistent with zero .",
    "tests of a representative sample of ogle light curves showed that the light of any hypothetical third star was typically not detectable , so we fixed third light ( @xmath38 ) at zero .",
    "however the issue of third light can be important and the possibility of its existence will have to be examined for individual distance modulus candidates when accurate photometry and spectroscopy is carried out .",
    "candidates suspected of having a significantly bright third star will probably have to be rejected .",
    "note that algol itself has such a third star .",
    "the parameters and control integers described above that govern the operation of _ lc _ and _ dc _ are summarized in tabs .",
    "[ t2 ] and [ t3 ] .",
    "our testing procedure simulated and solved not only _ sd _",
    "s but also detached binaries , so that proper comparisons could be made .",
    "we tried two configurations for every detached binary , each with its own pre - computed library .",
    "the simulated systems in one of these libraries are like main sequence binaries , with the hotter star ( star 1 ) larger and more massive .",
    "the second library shows differential evolution , with the higher mass star having expanded and cooled so as to have a lower temperature than its companion .",
    "however , although evolution has switched the stars roles in terms of temperature , it has not ( yet ) led to lobe filling , so we still have a detached binary that has not experienced mass reversal . in terms of real evolution , the lower mass star may also be significantly evolved if the masses are nearly equal , or may be essentially unevolved if the masses are substantially unequal .",
    "the condition with nearly equal masses and ",
    "double evolution  can be identified with the rs cvn type binaries that populate eclipsing binary catalogs in large numbers ( morgan and eggleton , 1979 ) .",
    "we adopt the better of the two solutions in the least squares sense , at the stage of the initial guess for each binary . in terms of rejecting aliased solutions ,",
    "this approach was found to be as successful as one where a fully converged solution was computed in each case .",
    "classification of the solution at the stage of the initial guess halves the computation time .",
    "we applied our fitting algorithm to simulated catalogs of _ sd _ and detached binaries .",
    "the objectives were to check _ dc _ s error estimates , assess systematic error due to assumptions of fixed parameter values , and investigate the success rate in distinguishing _ sd _ from detached binaries .",
    "we simulated 120 _ sd _ eclipsing binaries .",
    "each binary had 150 randomly spaced synthetic observations ( typical of ogle binaries ) , and gaussian noise that scales as the square root of light level , referenced to 5 percent noise at mean light .",
    "each system has @xmath31 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "notice that the t s may not be representative of the most common algols , being rather high and insufficiently different .",
    "the resulting moderate surface brightness ratios produce deep secondary eclipses , and relatively strong solutions .",
    "it turns out ( sec .",
    "[ oglefits ] ) that most of the _ sd _ s that we find are _ not _ typical of the common variety of algol , such that the simulation catalog temperatures are reasonably representative .",
    "limb darkening coefficients are from van hamme ( 1993 ) for the adopted temperatures .",
    "the simulation catalog had @xmath10 s between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "while algols typically have @xmath10 s of a few tenths , this larger range allows for the possibility of selecting objects in a different stage of evolution .",

    "clearly the problem is considerably less serious for _ sd _",

    "this is because , while the relative star sizes may appear equally well determined in the correct and aliased solutions , the luminosity ratio can be very different for systems with unequal radii and temperatures .",

    "notice that although the members of a well - detached binary may differ in surface brightness , _ they are twins in figure _ ( both nearly spheres ) and , with regard to the solution , _ mass ratio is irrelevant_. in particular , contributions to ellipsoidal variation in a well - detached binary are small and comparable for the two stars , so interchanging the radii has nil effect on ellipsoidal variation . in _ sd _ s , however , the contact component has practically all of the tidal distortion , so the ratio of radii ( which controls the ratio of luminosities ) can have some importance .",
    "for example , if we make the contact star larger , it will necessarily be more luminous and impress more ellipsoidal variation on the light curve .",

    "a distinction is made among classical algols , short - period algols , and ",
    "pseudo - algols ",
    "( our term ) .",
    "classical algols are understood to have experienced an episode of rapid and large scale matter transfer that has now ended , followed by a long - lived _ sd _ state of slow transfer . compared to many other categories of extrinsic and intrinsic variable stars",
    ", they form a category with very good evolutionary coherence .",
    "these are the only  algols  for which one can assume an _ sd _ state with confidence .",
    "the short period algols ( @xmath74 day ) are a mixed bag of uncertain status , containing some classical algols , some slightly detached main sequence binaries , and even some erstwhile _ oc _ systems that have temporarily broken contact . the third category , pseudo - algols , is primarily composed of main sequence detached binaries with very unequal ( primary vs. secondary ) temperatures , although a minority are bizarre products of moderately advanced evolution .",
    "that is , pseudo - algols are simply mis - typed , although some catalogs of algols have them in large numbers , as their light curves superficially resemble those of ( classical ) algols",
    ". evolved pseudo - algols are likely to be _ sd _ , but with more complicated histories than classical algols .",
    "the signature light curves , by which all of these categories are assigned the name _ algol type , _ have deep primary and shallow ( in extreme cases , nearly undetectable ) secondary eclipses .",
    "there usually is some variation between eclipses due to the `` reflection '' effect and tidal deformation , but typically with @xmath75 amplitude . among",
    "the three `` algol '' categories , classical algols conform best to the above light curve description and can thereby be rather reliably recognized , provided that the inclination is high ( say @xmath76 ) and the period is longer than a day or so .",
    "curiously , remarkably few ogle light curves resemble those of the common classical algols , which should be abundant according to experience with milky way binaries .",
    "typically , the ogle secondary eclipses are comparatively deep or there is too much variation between eclipses , or both conditions occur . reasons to consider",
    "are :    @xmath77 could milky way binary statistics be biased in favor of finding  normal  algols , perhaps observationally or according to the interests of observers ? might there even be a bias according to what becomes published ?",
    "unfortunately , existing statistical compilations do not reliably distinguish classical algols from algol look - alikes .",
    "resolution of these issues would be an interesting project , but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "@xmath77 could ogle smc statistics be biased against finding  normal  algols ? certainly there is no bias against period , as algol periods lie well within ogle limits",
    ". algols with primaries of spectral types middle a and later might be too faint for the ogle limiting magnitudes , but b - types should be readily observable .",
    "detection of the deep eclipses of algols is assured , given ogle s precision .",
    "therefore , although this possibility might explain a substantial deficiency of algols , it would not seem to explain their near absence in ogle .",
    "by eye we see only about 20 of the 1459 light curves that might resemble those of common algols , and only about 5 appear entirely normal .",
    "@xmath77 could we be misled by the printed ogle light curves being for the _ i _ band , while most light curves in journals are for _ v _ or _ b _ ? indeed , _",
    "i _ band curves will have deeper secondary and shallower primary eclipses , as well as increased ellipsoidal variation , compared to shorter wavelength bands .",
    "although these effects are in the right sense , one can make approximate allowances , and they seem insufficient to account for ogle s apparent shortfall in normal algol light curves .",
    "@xmath77 could algols be far less abundant in the smc than in the milky way ? at first sight",
    "this seems unlikely , but it must be considered , given that several other kinds of objects differ statistically between the smc and milky way .",
    "for example , algol formation could be sensitive to chemical composition , given that a proper physical and quantitative theory of algol formation does not exist .",
    "@xmath77 a minor point is that what appear to be alternating eclipses of equal depth may in some cases be successive primary eclipses , with undetectable secondaries in between and the period being half of that assumed .",
    "however that possibility could add only a few algols , at most .",
    "note that we do not require that our _ sd _ s be algols , and certainly not necessarily algols of the most ordinary kind .",
    "it is just that one expects ordinary algols to be the most abundant _ sd _ s , yet very few ogle light curves resemble those of the familiar classical algols .",
    "strong tidal dissipation associated with lobe filling causes the vast majority of _ sd _ s to have circular orbits , so eccentricity is a very useful practical discriminant by which to filter out non-_sd _",

    "several advantages of _ sd _ binaries , in particular the exploitation of lobe - filling configurations lead to accurate light - curve solutions and may therefore lead to accurate distances .",
    "however before investing the considerable effort to make the observations required for a distance determination , it is helpful to have confidence that the binary is appropriate for the purpose .",
    "we have found several advantages for _ sd _ systems that relate to the selection of candidates from the large catalogs of light - curves now becoming available .",
    "we find that aliased solutions ( where the radii are interchanged ) are significantly less of a problem for _ sd _ than detached systems .",

    "sd _ distance determination systems can therefore be selected for the desirable properties of having double - lined spectra and complete eclipses more reliably than can detached systems .",
    "we have computed both _ sd _ and detached solutions to the 1459 eclipsing binary stars identified in the smc by the ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .  1998 ) .",
    "this work follows our earlier paper on detached systems . by fitting simulated catalogs",
    "we estimate a success rate of 98 percent for finding acceptable converged solutions to _ sd _ configurations .",
    "acceptance of an _ sd _ solution does not establish that a system surely is _ sd _ , as detached systems can mimic _ sd _ light - curves and vice - versa .",
    "however , we show that the system condition ( detached or _ sd _ ) can often ( for about 1/3 of our simulated binaries ) be determined from the ratio of residuals ( _ ss _ ratio ) . of the ogle systems with both kinds of solution ,",
    "36 percent have _ ss _ ratios significantly different from unity , allowing morphological categorization .",
    "in particular , also requiring eccentricity consistent with zero , we find 36 systems that can be identified as being of the _ sd _ morphological type with reasonable reliability ( although 7 of these are doubtful due to very large mass ratios or periods ) , such that future observations with large scale optics should lead to accurate distance determinations . as emphasized in section 4 , we anticipate a coming time when several tests will better sift through high quality light curves and velocities from large optics .",
    "comparison of photometric and spectroscopic mass ratios will then settle most of the otherwise unclear decisions between detached and _ sd _ assignments .",
    "although we expected that most binaries selected as _",
    "sd _ would be common normal algols , the result is that only a small minority of our _ sd _ s have light curves like those of common algols .",
    "indeed , inspection of the ogle catalog reveals that systems with light - curves resembling those of classical algols are virtually absent .",
    "only two of our _ sd _ candidate binaries have solutions consistent with normal algols .",
    "basically the secondary stars have high surface brightnesses ( _ i.e. _ are hot compared to those of normal algols ) .",
    "this outcome could be a strongly positive one , as _ sd _ s with bright secondaries will have stronger light curve solutions ( with information from _ two _ deep eclipses ) than ordinary algols , while they may retain all the _ sd _ advantages mentioned in the introduction .",
    "they also have moderate luminosity ratios , and therefore greatly increased likelihood of their spectra being double - lined .",
    "it could be that some of the 36 _ sd _ binaries actually are _ oc _ , as testing for the _ oc _ condition is beyond the scope of this paper and will be treated in future work .",
    "that outcome also could be advantageous , as _ oc _ configurations can have very well conditioned light curve solutions , perhaps even better than _ sd _ s . _ oc",
    "_ binaries are rare at the high luminosities detectable by ogle ( although very common at much lower luminosity ) , yet discovery of just a few would be valuable help in finding the distance to the magellanic clouds .",

    "<S> estimation of distances to nearby galaxies by the use of eclipsing binaries as standard candles has recently become feasible because of new large scale instruments and the discovery of thousands of eclipsing binaries as spinoff from galactic microlensing surveys . published measurements of distances to detached eclipsing binaries in the large magellanic cloud combine stellar surface areas ( in absolute units ) determined from photometric light and radial velocity curves with surface brightnesses from model atmospheres and observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the method does not require the stars to be normal or undistorted , and is not limited in its applicability to the well detached systems that have traditionally been considered . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the potential usefulness of semi - detached vis  vis detached eclipsing binaries for distance determination , and examine and quantify criteria for their selection from large catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> following our earlier paper on detached binaries in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , we carry out semi - detached light curve solutions for smc binaries discovered by the ogle collaboration , identify candidates for smc distance estimation that can be targets of future high quality observations , and tabulate results of ogle light curve solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that semi - detached binaries have important advantages over well - detached systems as standard candles , although this idea runs counter to the usual view that the latter are optimal distance indicators . </S>",
    "<S> potential advantages are that ( 1 ) light curve solutions can be strengthened by exploiting lobe - filling configurations , ( 2 ) only single - lined spectra may be needed for radial velocities because the mass ratio can be determined from photometry in the case of complete eclipses , and ( 3 ) nearly all semi - detached binaries have sensibly circular orbits , which is not true for detached binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out simulations with synthetic data to see if semi - detached binaries can be reliably identified and to quantify the accuracy of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were done for detached as well as semi - detached binaries so as to constitute a proper controlled study . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations demonstrate two additional advantages for semi - detached distance determination candidates ; ( 4 ) the well - known difficulty in distinguishing solutions with interchanged radii ( aliasing ) is much less severe for semi - detached than for detached binaries , and ( 5 ) the condition of complete eclipse ( which removes a near degeneracy between inclination and the ratio of the radii ) is identified with improved reliability . in many cases </S>",
    "<S> we find that parameters are accurately determined ( _ e.g. _ relative errors in radii smaller than 10% ) , and that detached and semi - detached systems can be distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> we select 36 candidate semi - detached systems ( although 7 of these are doubtful due to large mass ratios or periods ) from the ogle smc eclipsing binary catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we expected that most semi - detached candidates would have light curves similar to those of common algol binaries but that turned out not to be the case , and we note that fully algol - like light curves are nearly absent in the ogle sample . we discuss possible explanations for the near absence of obvious algols in ogle , including whether their paucity is real or apparent . </S>"
