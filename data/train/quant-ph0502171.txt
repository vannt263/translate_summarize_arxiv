    "high - precision control of cold atoms in optical lattices has found many potential applications in recent years , especially in the implementation of quantum information processing and the modelling of strongly correlated condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "these applications have been fuelled by experimental techniques which enable engineering of lattice models with sensitive control over lattice parameters @xcite , independent control for different internal spin states @xcite , and control of interactions between atoms via feshbach resonances @xcite .    for high precision applications , initial state preparation will play a key role in addition to such control of hamiltonian parameters @xcite .",
    "quantum computing applications generally require an initial register with exactly one atom per lattice site @xcite , and observation of interesting effects in strongly correlated systems often requires the initial spatial patterns of atoms or states with precisely chosen filling factors @xcite .",
    "the first step in preparation of such states is often adiabatically increasing the lattice potential , making use of repulsive onsite interactions for bosons @xcite or pauli blocking for fermions @xcite to load essentially one atom on each lattice site .",
    "however , experimental imperfections will generally lead to non - negligible errors in the resulting states .",
    "this can be improved upon by coherently filtering a state with a filling factor initially greater than one @xcite , or potentially by schemes involving individual addressing and precise measurement of the occupation in individual lattice sites @xcite .",
    "whilst these methods can , in principle , produce high fidelity initial states , each of them relies either on the perfect experimental implementation of a single - shot coherent process or on perfect measurements to avoid defects in the final state . in this article",
    "we propose a _",
    "fault - tolerant _ loading scheme in which the state being prepared always improves in time .",
    "the key idea is the addition of a dissipative element to the loading process , in contrast to previous schemes , which rely on coherent transfer or perfect measurements .",
    "as we will see below , this dissipative element plays a similar role in our scheme to that of spontaneous emissions in optical pumping .    motivated by advances in experiments with cold fermions @xcite , our scheme is designed to produce a regular patterned array of fermions in an optical lattice .",
    "fermions have a natural advantage in initialising atomic qubit registers because pauli - blocking prevents doubly - occupied sites , and most of the techniques illustrated using bosons in quantum computing proposals apply equally to fermions .",
    "fermionic species are also of special interest in the simulation of condensed matter systems @xcite .    ) into an excited motional state in the lattice ( internal state @xmath0 via a raman process ; ( b ) these atoms are cooled to the ground motional level via collisional interaction with the reservoir atoms , and doubly - occupied sites in the ground level are prevented by pauli blocking ; ( c ) remaining atoms in the excited motional levels are removed by carefully detuning the raman coupling above the fermi energy . ]",
    "the setup for our scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . atoms in an internal state @xmath1 do not couple to the lattice lasers , and form a cold fermi reservoir , which will play the dual role of a source for atoms to transfer into the lattice , and a bath for cooling lattice atoms .",
    "atoms in the reservoir are coupled into an excited motional level in the lattice ( in internal state @xmath0 ) via a coherent laser - induced raman process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]a ) @xcite .",
    "these atoms are then cooled sympathetically by the reservoir atoms via collisional interactions , and will decay to the motional ground state together with creation of a particle - hole pair in the reservoir ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]b ) .",
    "this is analogous to the sympathetic cooling process previously presented for a bosonic reservoir in @xcite .",
    "double occupancy in the ground state is prevented by pauli blocking ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]b ) , and atoms in the ground state are not coupled back to the reservoir because the raman process is far off resonance , so the occupation of the lowest motional level always increases in time .",
    "additional atoms remaining in excited states at the end of the process can then be removed by a careful adiabatic detuning and switching off of the coupling lasers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]c ) .",
    "such dissipative transfer of atoms into a desired dark state is strongly reminiscent of optical pumping , in which atoms are excited by a laser , and undergo spontaneous emissions into a desired state which does not couple to the laser field .",
    "the net result of this is to transfer entropy from the atomic system into the `` reservoir '' ( the vacuum modes of the radiation field ) in order to produce a single pure electronic state from an initial mixed state . here",
    "the creation of an excitation in the reservoir replaces the spontaneous emission event , placing the atom in a state where it is not coupled by the raman process , and leading to the production of our final pure state , namely a high fidelity array of one atom in each lattice site ( or a pattern of occupied and unoccupied sites ) .",
    "we note , in addition , that the purely coherent laser - assisted loading could be used as a stand - alone technique to load the lattice , and could produce high fidelity states if used iteratively , together with cooling of the fermi reservoir .",
    "such cooling would fill holes produced in the previous loading step , so that pauli blocking would prevent a net transfer of atoms from the lattice to the reservoir , thus ensuring that the filling factor in the lattice is improved in each step .",
    "the detailed analysis of this dissipative loading process is divided into two parts .",
    "coherent laser - assisted loading of atoms into the entire lattice in a single addressed motional band is discussed in section [ section : coherent ] , and the dissipative transfer of atoms to the lowest motional band is analysed in section [ section : incoherent ] .",
    "the combination of these two elements into the overall scheme is then detailed in section [ section : combined ] .",
    "we begin by studying the coupling of the atoms forming the reservoir into the optical lattice via a raman process , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "the atoms in the reservoir are in an internal state @xmath1 , which does not couple to the lasers producing the optical lattice .",
    "they form a fermi gas containing @xmath2 atoms with a density @xmath3 in a volume @xmath4 , with fermi energy ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the atoms .",
    "the internal state @xmath1 is coupled to a different internal state @xmath0 , which is trapped by a deep three dimensional optical lattice potential @xmath8 via a raman transition .",
    "our goal is to couple atoms @xmath9 into the lattice and to achieve an average occupation of fermions close to one in all lattice sites in one chosen motional band , without coupling to other motional levels .",
    "this should be achieved in a time , where no atoms are allowed to tunnel between different lattice sites and no loss of atoms occurs ( due to , e.g. , spontaneous emission events leading to additional internal states etc . ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this system is given by @xmath10 where the hamiltonians for the atoms @xmath11 in the optical lattice and for the atoms @xmath9 forming the reservoir are @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , in which the anticommuting field operators @xmath14 create a fermion in the internal state @xmath15 at the position @xmath16 .",
    "are resonantly coupled to the first excited bloch band of the lattice via a raman laser with two photon rabi frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the resonant energy @xmath18 is experimentally tunable via the raman detuning , and the energy separation of the two bloch bands is denoted by @xmath19 . ]",
    "the two internal states are coupled via a raman process described by the hamiltonian @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the raman detuning @xmath21 and the effective ( two photon ) rabi frequency @xmath22 , where we have assumed running waves with the same wave vectors for two lasers producing the raman coupling .",
    "we expand the field operators for the free fermions in the reservoir as plane waves and the field operators for the lattice atoms in terms of wannier functions , @xmath23 where , @xmath24 creates a reservoir atom with momentum @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the creation operator for an atom in lattice site @xmath27 and motional state with @xmath28 in the deep three dimensional optical lattice , for which @xmath29 , denotes the corresponding wannier function .    inserting into eqs .",
    "( [ ha0])-([hcoh_fieldops ] ) we obtain @xmath30 where the single particle energy of a reservoir atom with momentum @xmath25 is @xmath31 and the energy of a lattice atom in the motional state @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 as we are dealing with very deep optical lattices , tunneling between different lattices sites is strongly suppressed and has thus been neglected .",
    "the raman coupling parameter @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35    for our deep optical lattices without tunneling between different sites , the periodic lattice is equivalent to an array of independent microtraps , where each individual trap is well approximated by a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the wannier functions @xmath29 can then be approximated by harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions @xmath36 of the @xmath32-th oscillator level in lattice site @xmath27 .",
    "this approximation allows us to calculate the coupling parameters @xmath34 from the fermi reservoir to the optical lattice explicitly . for an isotropic three dimensional lattice ( where the frequency @xmath19 of each oscillator is given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) the couplings to the lowest and first three ( degenerate ) excited motional states",
    "are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the size of the harmonic oscillator ground state , and the index @xmath41 labels the coupling to the three degenerate states of the first excited oscillator level .",
    "the characteristics of the coherent loading procedure strongly depend on the interplay between the ( experimentally adjustable ) parameters : the detuning @xmath21 and two photon rabi frequency @xmath22 of the lasers producing the raman coupling , the fermi energy @xmath42 and the separation @xmath19 of the oscillator levels .",
    "the raman detuning can be adjusted to address different states in the fermi sea and different motional states in the lattice . in the following we write @xmath43 to indicate the resonant coupling of reservoir atoms with energy @xmath18 to the @xmath44 motional states of each lattice site .",
    "we note that it is straightforward to address other motional states in the lattice ( e.g. to directly load the lowest level ) by adjusting the detuning @xmath21 .",
    "however , as we will later use the transfer of the atoms from the reservoir to the lattice as a first step of an indirect loading of the lowest motional states as described in the introduction , we choose the transfer to the first excited motional state here . to be able to selectively fill the first excited oscillator levels , the conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( and consequently @xmath47 ) have to be fulfilled , in order to avoid unwanted coupling to higher excited and to the lowest motional state , respectively .",
    "the physics of the loading process allows us to identify two different loading limits : ( 1 ) the `` fast loading regime '' , where @xmath48 and ( 2 ) the `` slow regime '' , where @xmath49 below we will see that our goal to selectively fill a certain motional state without coupling to other states can only be achieved in the slow loading regime , but to obtain more insight into the physics of the loading dynamics it is instructive to discuss both regimes .    in the fast loading regime , where the rabi frequency @xmath22 is the largest frequency scale in the system , the loading is performed in a very short time @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the fermi velocity , where atoms in the fermi reservoir do not move significantly during the loading on a lengthscale given by the size @xmath52 of the harmonic oscillator ground state .",
    "the wannier modes in the lattice then couple to localized reservoir fermions at each site , and thus the dynamics for different sites decouple .",
    "given there is at least one fermion in the reservoir per size @xmath52 of the ground state in each lattice site during the loading , i.e. , given the density of the reservoir atoms @xmath53 each @xmath44 motional state in each lattice site can be filled with at least one atom from the reservoir by applying a @xmath54-pulse @xmath55 . for an optical lattice with @xmath56khz",
    "the required densities of the fermi gas are @xmath57@xmath58 for @xmath59k and for deeper lattices the required densities are even higher .",
    "the condition ( [ denscondfast ] ) for the density of the reservoir can be expressed in terms of energies as @xmath60 this inequality violates the condition @xmath47 , which is necessary to be able to selectively address individual motional states .",
    "consequently , unwanted population will be transferred to additional motional states in this loading limit , which would have to be carefully removed after the loading process .    in the slow loading regime , where condition ( [ slowomegacond ] ) is fulfilled , the atoms in the fermi reservoir are no longer frozen during the loading process , but are allowed to move with respect to the lattice during the loading .",
    "this is now performed in a time @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the lattice spacing .",
    "consequently , the density condition ( [ denscondfast ] ) can be relaxed to @xmath63 i.e. , we only need one atom in the reservoir per lattice site to be able to efficiently fill the lattice .",
    "for typical experimental parameters @xmath64 nm for @xmath59k this results in the condition @xmath65@xmath58 , which has already been achieved in current experiments ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the density condition ( [ denscondslow ] ) expressed in terms of energies now reads @xmath66 with @xmath67 the recoil frequency .",
    "as @xmath68 for a deep optical lattice , the condition @xmath47 can be fulfilled in this loading limit , and as @xmath69 , individual motional states in each site can be addressed . in the following",
    "we will investigate these two extreme limits and the intermediate regime in detail .        in this regime , where the motion of the atoms in the reservoir is frozen on the scale @xmath52 during the transfer , the physics is essentially an on - site coupling and transfer .",
    "we thus find it useful to expand the modes in the reservoir in terms of localized wannier functions corresponding to the lattice .",
    "such an expansion of the reservoir modes arises naturally from the definition of the matrix elements @xmath70 ( eq .",
    "( [ rkal ] ) ) and allows us to write @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mode corresponding to the wannier function @xmath29 .",
    "note that these collective modes fulfill @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 denotes the kronecker delta ) , i.e. , modes corresponding to different lattice sites or to different motional states are orthogonal .",
    "furthermore , in the fast regime we can neglect the first two terms @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the hamiltonian ( [ htot_coh ] ) due to the condition eq .",
    "( [ fastomegacond ] ) during the loading time @xmath77 and the total hamiltonian can be approximated by @xmath78 .",
    "the sites thus decouple , and the loading process at each site proceeds independently , but with the same rabi frequency @xmath22 for the coupling .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of the matrix elements of the single particle density matrix , i.e. , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the fast loading regime ,",
    "where @xmath82 , the respective matrix elements can be calculated analytically from the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hrcwannier ] ) , and we find for states , where @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the time evolution of the occupation of the modes in the lattice and in the fermi sea , respectively .",
    "these expressions assume that the lattice modes are initially empty and the corresponding modes in the fermi sea are initially filled .",
    "if the fermi sea is initially filled up to @xmath42 , then this assumption is fulfilled for any @xmath27 and @xmath32 for which that each mode @xmath87 contains contributions only from states with energy below @xmath42 .",
    "thus , in the fast loading regime the occupation in the lowest and first excited motional state undergoes rabi - oscillations at a rabi frequency @xmath22 , and provided the density is sufficiently high , the lattice can be efficiently filled by applying a @xmath54-pulse , @xmath88 with loading time @xmath89 .",

    "we only consider the lowest two motional states for simplicity , but all results are easily extended to more motional states .",
    "also , the simulations are one dimensional , which means that the excited oscillator state with @xmath44 is no longer degenerate . because couplings to motional excitations in different spatial directions are independent , such simulations are representative for loading into each of the three 3d modes .    in fig .",

    "these numerical simulations show that the bloch bands still can not be individually addressed , and the fidelity becomes worse if the rabi frequency is decreased .",
    "thus , our chosen motional state can , in principle , be efficiently filled in this regime on sufficiently fast timescales .",

    "in this limit these problems do not exist and we are able to selectively load a single energy level efficiently .      in this regime , transport is significant during the loading , and the system dynamics are described by the complete hamiltonian  ( [ htot_coh ] ) . as the reservoir atoms move between wannier modes during the loading process , it is now more convenient to directly use the momentum representation eq .",

    "we must sweep the resonant frequency @xmath18 through a range of at least @xmath122 , scanning through many modes .",
    "such a procedure also has the advantage that as we only couple to a narrow range in the fermi sea at any one time , the reverse process of transferring particles from the lattice to the fermi sea will be suppressed by pauli blocking . in our numerical simulations",

    "this loading mechanism gives us the significant advantage over simple loading techniques such as adiabatically increasing the lattice depth that we can address a particular energy level in the lattice , whilst not coupling to levels that are sufficiently far detuned .",

    "note again that as with the full dissipative loading scheme , a single sweep would also not need to completely fill the upper band .",
    "the dissipative element discussed in the next section allows for the production of an arbitrarily high - fidelity state without the requirement of iteratively cooling the fermi reservoir .",

    "as described in the previous section we obtain @xmath160 which is local in each lattice site because of the small overlap between wannier functions for neighboring sites in a deep lattice , with @xmath161 each @xmath162 describes a scattering process in which a particle - hole pair is created in the reservoir by scattering an atom from momentum state @xmath163 , combined with the transition of an atom at site @xmath27 from motional state @xmath164 .",
    "if the transition in the lattice is from a higher energy mode to a lower energy mode , this corresponds to a cooling transition , whereas the reverse process constitutes heating .",
    "as the initial temperature of the reservoir @xmath165 , the heating processes will be , at least initially , insignificant , as few reservoir atoms will exist with sufficient energy to excite an atom in the lattice .",
    "if the number of atoms in the reservoir is large compared to the number of sites in the lattice ( @xmath166 ) , then the rate of heating processes due to interaction with previously excited atoms will be small compared to cooling processes due to interaction with atoms remaining below the fermi energy @xmath42 .",
    "because the cooling processes in different lattice sites couple to different modes , and therefore are incoherent , the reservoir can then be treated throughout the process approximately as a @xmath153 bath .",
    "this can be further enhanced in two ways .",
    "firstly , in an experiment in which the reservoir gas is confined in a weak harmonic trap , particles with sufficiently large energies can be allowed to escape from the trap .",
    "the large separation of the bloch band @xmath19 , and corresponding excitation energy will then cause many excited reservoir atoms to leave the trap , providing effective evaporative cooling during the process .",
    "secondly , the lattice depth could be modulated during the experiment , so that the excitation energy changes , decreasing the probability that atoms are heated by previously excited reservoir atoms .",
    "the cooling dynamics are then described in the born - markov approximation by a master equation for the reduced density operator @xmath167 for the atoms in the lattice .",
    "if we consider coupling of atoms from the first excited motional levels @xmath168 to the ground state , the resulting master equation ( derived in appendix [ me ] ) is @xmath169 with @xmath170 here , the jump operator @xmath171 describes the cooling of a lattice atom in site @xmath27 from the first excited motional level @xmath32 to the ground state .",
    "these results are obtained by calculating the integral over momenta in the fermi sea to lowest order in @xmath172 .",
    "the approximation in the second line of eq .  ( [ gamma ] ) , in which neglect off diagonal terms @xmath173 amounts to the approximation that the coherence length of the fermi reservoir is much shorter than the lattice spacing .",
    "this is true provided that the wavelength of the emitted particle excitation , @xmath174 , is much shorter than the lattice spacing , i.e. , @xmath175 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous approximation that the lattice is so deep that we can neglect tunnelling between neighbouring sites .",
    "this can be seen directly when these off - diagonal terms are calculated , as for large @xmath176 they decay ( to lowest order in @xmath47 ) as @xmath177 and @xmath178 , for @xmath59k as given in @xcite , with the bohr radius @xmath179 and a deep optical lattice with @xmath180khz , we find a decay rate @xmath181khz .",
    "thus , cooling can again be achieved fast enough , as this rate is much faster than typical loss rates of the lattice atoms .",
    "note , that this value of the decay rate can be made even larger e.g. by tuning the scattering length @xmath158 via a feshbach resonance , as @xmath182 , by increasing the density of the external gas or by increasing the lattice depth .",
    "in summary we have shown that for a cold reservoir gas with sufficiently many atoms fast ground state cooling of lattice atoms can be achieved with the dissipative coupling of the lattice to the reservoir .",
    "the necessary experimental parameters have already been achieved in real experiments , and the cooling rates are tunable via the scattering length and the density of the reservoir gas .",
    "the combination of the cooling process with laser - assisted loading in the limit @xmath183 will give a final high - fidelity state in the lowest motional level .",
    "the primary role of the dissipative element is to transfer atoms into a state in which they are not coupled back to the fermi reservoir , which is made possible because of the selective addressing of the @xmath44 motional levels in this regime .",
    "multiple occupation of a single site in the lowest motional state is forbidden due to pauli - blocking , and thus the lowest motional state is monotonically filled ; the filling factor and hence the fidelity of the state being prepared always improving in time .",
    "again , patterns of atoms may be loaded in the lowest state by using a superlattice to shift the energy of the @xmath44 motional level out of resonance with the raman process in particular sites , preventing atoms from being coupled from the fermi reservoir into those sites .",
    "this energy shift will also further suppress tunnelling of atoms from neighbouring sites .",
    "if the laser - assisted loading and the cooling are carried out separately , each being performed after the other in iterative steps , then from the analysis of sections [ section : coherent ] and [ section : incoherent ] we see that an arbitrarily high fidelity final state can be obtained .",
    "this _ pulsed _ scheme gives us an upper bound on the timescale for loading a state of given fidelity , which corresponds to the combination of the two individual timescales for laser - assisted loading and cooling .",
    "provided that the number of atoms in the reservoir is much larger than the number of lattice sites to be filled ( @xmath166 ) , and the markov approximation made in describing the cooling dynamics is valid , then there will be no adverse effects arising from the loading and cooling processes sharing the same reservoir .",
    "thus , we can combine the two processes into a _ continuous _",
    "scheme , which in practice will proceed much faster , as the continuous evacuation of the excited band due to cooling will also speed up the loading process .    at the end of the loading process",
    "we must still ensure that the finite occupation of the excited motional levels is properly removed .",
    "this can be achieved by detuning the resonant frequency for the raman coupling above the fermi energy after the loading sweep , coupling the remaining atoms to empty states above the fermi sea , and then switching off the coupling adiabatically .",
    "the dynamics of the pulsed process are already well understood from the analysis of sections [ section : coherent ] and [ section : incoherent ] . to illustrate the dynamics of the combined continuous process",
    ", we again perform numerical simulations , in which we compute the matrix elements of the reduced system density operator .",
    "the dynamics of the total system including both the laser coupling and the collisional interaction between the optical lattice and the fermi reservoir are described by the full hamiltonian @xmath184 and in the markov approximation with respect to the cooling process , the matrix elements of the system density operator can now be calculated from the master equation ( [ mealbet ] ) as shown in appendix [ tecombined ] . in order to obtain a closed set of differential equations which can be integrated numerically",
    ", we use an approximation based on wick s theorem to factorize fourth order correlation functions into second order correlation functions ( see appendix [ tecombined ] ) @xcite .    ) and ( b ) first excited ( @xmath44 ) motional level for the continuous combination of coherent loading in the slow regime and dissipative cooling .",
    "the resonant frequency is swept from @xmath123 to @xmath185 and the raman coupling is switched off adiabatically .",
    "parameters used : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined ] we plot the time evolution of the occupation of the two motional levels in the continuous regime as a function of time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined]a we see that we indeed achieve a high occupation of the lowest motional level from the combination of laser - assisted coupling to the excited motional level in the regime @xmath190 and cooling to the ground state . for the typical values given in the figure caption ,",
    "the loading time @xmath89 for a state with @xmath191 is again on the order of a few milliseconds .",
    "this required loading time can be further decreased by tuning @xmath192 via the density of the external gas or the strength of the collisional interaction between atoms in the lattice and atoms in the reservoir .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : combined]b we see that as we fill the lower motional level , the filling in the upper level is depleted , and as we continue to tune the lasers so that this level is coupled to states in the reservoir above the fermi energy @xmath193 , the remaining population in this level is removed .    as a final remark",
    "we note that such a procedure could , in principle , also be applied to bosons .",
    "however , without pauli blocking to prevent double - occupation of the ground motional level , we rely on the onsite collisional shift @xmath194 to make the raman coupling of an atom from the reservoir into an excited state off - resonant if an atom already exists in the ground motional state .",
    "second order processes occurring at a rate @xmath195 can still create double occupation , so we require @xmath196 , and the advantage of true fault tolerance is not present as it is for fermions .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the combination of laser - assisted loading of atoms into an excited motional state and the cooling of atoms from this motional state to the ground level gives a fault - tolerant loading scheme to produce high fidelity registers of fermions in an optical lattices with one atom per lattice site .",
    "application of a superlattice allows this to be extended to generalised patterns of atoms , and all of these processes can be completed on timescales much faster than those on which atoms can be lost from the lattice .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is that the dissipative transitions in the lattice , similar to optical pumping , gives us a process in which the fidelity of the final state ( in the lowest motional level ) improves monotonically in time .",
