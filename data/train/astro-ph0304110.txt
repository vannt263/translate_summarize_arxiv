    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been profoundly understood since the discovery of afterglows in 1997 ( wijers 1997 ; piran 1999 ; van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers 2000 ; mszros 2002 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution of a grb remnant is well described by an ultra - relativistic forward shock that sweeps into an interstellar medium ( ism ) and slows down to the non - relativistic phase while the resulting afterglow is due to synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated by the shock .    however , the emission from a reverse shock propagating into the shell of the grb ejecta , was also predicted ( mszros @xmath2 rees 1997 ; sari @xmath2 piran 1999a ) . before the reverse shock crosses the shell , the shocked shell matter carries an amount of energy comparable to that of the forward shocked interstellar medium .",
    "the prompt optical flash of grb @xmath0 ( akerlof et al . 1999 ) motivates investigations of emission from the reverse shock ( mszros @xmath2 rees 1999 ; sari @xmath2 piran 1999b ; kobayashi @xmath2 sari 2000 ; kobayashi 2000 ) .",
    "the light curve of an optical flash in a uniform ism has been well studied in both thin shell and thick shell cases ( kobayashi 2000 ) and it is found that the optical flash of grb @xmath0 is due to the radiation from a mildly relativistic reverse shock ( kobayashi @xmath2 sari 2000 ) .",
    "recently , the contribution of reverse shocks to early radio afterglows was also discussed by soderberg @xmath2 ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 )",
    ".    there is increasing evidence for the association between some grbs and type ib / c supernovae .",
    "the most direct evidence is the association of grb @xmath3 with sn @xmath4bw ( galama et al .",
    "this association is strengthed by its radio emission after the burst ( li @xmath2 chevalier 1999 ) . up to date",
    "several grb afterglows , e.g. , grbs @xmath5 ( reichart 1999 ) , @xmath6 ( sokolov 2001 ) , @xmath7 ( bloom et al 1999 ) , @xmath8 ( sahu et al . 2000 ) , @xmath9 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "2001 ) , @xmath10 ( lazzati et al .",
    "2001 ) , and @xmath11 ( bloom et al .",
    "2002 ) , show a supernova component in their light curves peaking at @xmath12 , with @xmath13 15 days for sn ic .",
    "one of the most popular central engines of grbs now is believed to be the collapse of massive stars ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "this collapsar / hypernova scenario naturally explains the broad and shifted iron - group emission lines in grbs ( mclaughlin , wijers @xmath2 brown 2002 ) .",
    "the iron line emission can be attributed in the envelope models either from the irradiated shallower layers on the funnel wall along the rotation axis by a continuing but decaying relativistic outflow ( rees @xmath2 mszros 2000 ) or from the dissipation of the magnetized thermal bubble expanding into h envelope of the progenitor , which results from the interaction between the jet with continuing energy injection and the stellar envelope ( mszros @xmath2 rees 2001 ) .",
    "the place of the iron line emission in the envelope models is at h envelope radius @xmath14 cm , where a small amount of iron , @xmath15 m@xmath16 and @xmath17 m@xmath16 , can meet the requirement .",
    "other iron line emission models require a large line emission radius , @xmath18 cm , and much larger iron mass @xmath19 m@xmath16 ( vietri et al .",
    "2001 ; bttcher @xmath2 fryer 2001 ) .",
    "the measured emission lines in the x - ray afterglow of grb 011211 favors the latter ( reeves et al .",
    "the pre - explosion wind structure can survive in envelope models but may be destroyed in the other models due to either the ejection of sn prior to grb or the common envelope evolution in the binary system .",
    "detailed calculations and more sensitive data on x - ray afterglow spectral features will distinguish between the various line emission models ( ballantyne @xmath2 ramirez - ruiz 2001 ) .",
    "the light curve steepening of some well - observed grb afterglows deviates from the predictions of the standard model ( sari , piran @xmath2 narayan 1998 ) .",
    "this deviation leads to discussions of the environment and geometry effects .",
    "previous studies have discussed the afterglow from a spherical blast wave in a wind ( dai @xmath2 lu 1998 ; chevalier @xmath2 li 1999 , 2000 ) and from a jet in a wind ( livio @xmath2 waxman 2000 ; dai @xmath2 gou 2001 ; gou et al .",
    "the wind environments of grbs @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are recognized in the spherical - wind model ( chevalier @xmath2 li 2000 ; li @xmath2 chevalier 2001 ) . in the jet model , ten broadband grb afterglows ( i.e. , grbs 970508 , 980519 , 990123 , 990510 , 991208 , 991216 , 000301c , 000418 , 000926 , and 010222 ) have been well fitted ( panaitescu 2001 ; panaitescu @xmath2 kumar 2001 , 2002 ) . among them , only grbs @xmath22 , @xmath0 and @xmath23 are inconsistent with wind environments .",
    "however , we also noticed that frail et al .",
    "( 2000 ) gave a better fit for their first 63 days observations of the radio afterglow of grb @xmath22 in the spherical - wind model .",
    "information on the surrounding environment of a grb can also be obtained by considering the evolution of the soft x - ray absorption property according to the surrounding density distribution ( lazzati @xmath2 perna 2002 ) .",
    "the expected absorption of a wind environment will quickly drop to the undetectable level in no more than 1 second .",
    "it conflicts with the evidence of variable soft x - ray absorption in three grbs detected by",
    "_ _ beppo__sax .",
    "nonetheless , the wind environments can not be excluded by this method due to the limited samples .",
    "it may give some evidence for another type of grbs environments , such as dense clouds .",
    "superbubbles which are proposed as the sites of grbs have been expected to explain the obtained low densities @xmath24 @xmath25 ( scalo @xmath2 wheeler 2001 ) .",
    "it requires a very weak stellar wind at least 6 orders weaker than that of the progenitor of sn @xmath4bw to insure non - contamination of the supperbubble by the wind at a typical afterglow radius .",
    "the wind profile @xmath26 may be terminated at some radius @xmath27 cm , where the wind sweeps up a mass of ism comparable to that of the wind and leads to a quasi - homogeneous dense shell with the mean density @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath25 - @xmath30 @xmath25 and the thickness @xmath28 @xmath31 cm ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "this termination of the wind profile will not affect our analysis of the dynamic evolution of very early afterglows , but has the potential reduction of the optical flash . in this paper",
    "we perform a more detailed calculation of the very early afterglows of grbs in wind environments including the reverse shock effect . in ",
    "2 we give the hydrodynamics of forward and reverse shocks . in",
    " 3 early afterglow light curves at optical and radio bands are calculated .",
    "we discuss some observational implications of our results in  4 .",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption of electrons with a broken power law energy distribution is discussed in the appendix .",
    "we consider a uniform and cold relativistic coasting shell with rest mass @xmath32 , the energy @xmath33 , the initial lorentz factor @xmath34 , and the observed width @xmath35 , which sweeps up a wind with the particle number density @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( chevalier @xmath2 li 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "two shocks develop : a forward shock propagating into the wind and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "there are four regions separated by the two shocks : ( 1 ) the unshocked wind , ( 2 ) the shocked wind , ( 3 ) the shocked shell material , ( 4 ) the unshocked shell material . from the shock jump conditions and equality of pressures and velocities along the contact discontinuity , the lorentz factor @xmath40 , the pressure @xmath41 , and the number density @xmath42 in both shocked regions can be determined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( blandford @xmath2 mckee 1976 , hereafter bm ) .",
    "we define the sedov radius , at which the swept - up wind s rest - mass energy equals the initial energy @xmath33 of the shell , i.e. , @xmath46 . assuming that the shell does nt enter the spreading stage , the width @xmath35 is a constant , and @xmath47 .",
    "the property of the reverse shock is largely determined by a parameter defined as @xmath48 ( sari @xmath2 piran 1995 ) , which can be further given by @xmath49    as shown by sari @xmath2 piran ( 1995 ) , if @xmath50 , or the baryon loading @xmath51 , the reverse shock will be a newtonian reverse shock ( nrs ) , and the reverse shock will be a relativistic reverse shock ( rrs ) if @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "for rrs , the lorentz factor of the shocked shell relative to the unshocked shell is @xmath54 , and the lorentz factors of shocked matter are @xmath55 .",
    "the time for the reverse shock to cross the shell in the fixed frame is @xmath56 where @xmath57 for rrs and @xmath58 for nrs ( sari @xmath2 piran 1995 ) .",
    "the shock expands to the radius @xmath59 when the reverse shock is just over .",
    "in addition to @xmath60 there are two other characteristic radii involved here : the deceleration radius @xmath61 , at which the swept - up mass is @xmath62 , and the shell spreading radius @xmath63 .",
    "they have different dependences on @xmath64 , @xmath35 and @xmath45 for the wind and ism cases ( sari @xmath2 piran 1995 ) .",
    "a parameter @xmath65 is introduced to compare these three radii . according to equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 describes rrs : @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , while @xmath71 describes nrs : @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . for rrs ,",
    "the previous assumption of @xmath74const is always satisfied , and deceleration of the shell happens before the reverse shock crosses it . for nrs we must consider the spreading effect of the shell , and @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the comoving density ratio @xmath77 decreases with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "the reverse shock becomes trans - relativistic at @xmath79(=@xmath80 ) when @xmath81 .",
    "a similar correction on @xmath82 and @xmath60 must be done since @xmath35 and @xmath83 vary with @xmath78 .",
    "we are most interested in rrs because of both a large energy output and a constant width .",
    "before rrs crosses the shell , the distance that the shell travels when rrs crosses a length @xmath84 in the unshocked shell frame can be given by ( kobayashi 2000 ) , @xmath85 the shocked electron number is proportional to @xmath86 . in the observer",
    "s frame we have @xmath87 , so the hydrodynamic variables are @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the total electron number of the shell and @xmath91 is the observer s time at which the rrs crosses the shell , which is one half of the crossing time adopted by kobayashi ( 2000 ) .",
    "after rrs crosses the shell , the temperature of the shocked shell is very high and it will expands adiabatically and enters the spreading stage .",
    "since it locates not far away from the forward shocked wind , we take the bm self - similar adiabatic solution with impulsive energy injection for the evolution of the shocked shell ( kabayashi @xmath2 sari 2000 ) . with @xmath92 , we get @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables are therefore given by @xmath95 @xmath96    the hydrodynamic evolution of a relativistic forward shock in a wind has already been discussed in some details ( dai @xmath2 lu 1998 ; chevalier @xmath2 li 2000 ; panaitescu @xmath2 kumar 2000 ) . before rrs crosses the shell , the lorentz factor of forward shock @xmath97 is a constant and equals @xmath98 .",
    "the forward shock radius is @xmath99 .",
    "note that there is a difference of a factor of 2 between the reverse shock radius and the forward shock radius , which arises from the fact that the forward shock moves with @xmath100 at any time although the photon emitter travels with @xmath101 ( chevalier @xmath2 li 2000 ) .",
    "so the time when the reverse shock is finished becomes @xmath102 . for @xmath103 @xmath104 with @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic variables evolve as @xmath107 the above analytical hydrodynamic evolution for both the reverse shock and forward shock is valid only in the relativistic phase .",
    "however , a late - time afterglow may be produced by a non - relativistic forward shock ( huang , dai @xmath2 lu 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "thus , our results are applied only for early or very early afterglows in wind environments , including the reverse shock emission .",
    "the shock accelerates electrons to a power - law energy distribution with an index @xmath41 and with a minimum lorentz factor @xmath108 m_p / m_e$ ] , where @xmath109 is a fraction of the internal energy density carried by the electrons .",
    "the standard radiation mechanism for grb afterglows is synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons in the magnetic field whose energy density is another fraction ( @xmath110 ) of the internal energy density .",
    "we also consider synchrotron self - absorbtion at the radio band .",
    "thus , the spectrum as discussed by sari , piran @xmath2 narayan ( 1998 ) in the ism case can be used to discuss an afterglow in the wind case .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by three break frequencies : the typical frequency @xmath111 , the cooling frequency @xmath112 , and the self - absorption frequency @xmath113 .",
    "a detailed derivation of @xmath113 for fast - cooling and slow - cooling regimes is given in the appendix . since @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 . the peak flux @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the distance from the grb site to the observer .",
    "before rrs crosses the shell ( @xmath120 ) , @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 where @xmath124 ergs , @xmath125 , @xmath126 cm , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 cm .",
    "the time for the reverse shock to cross the shell is @xmath131 s. for @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 which is consistent with eq . ( 18 ) of dai @xmath2 lu ( 2001 ) . for @xmath134",
    ", we have @xmath135 the cooling lorentz factor ( @xmath136 ) is determined by the dynamical timescale . at very early times",
    ", @xmath137 may be less than unity , which is impossible in physics .",
    "in fact the radiation power of such electrons with @xmath138 will be cyclotron power , instead of synchrotron power . according to dai & lu ( 2001 )",
    ", we neglect the radiation before @xmath139 ( same as @xmath140 in dai @xmath2 lu 2001 ) when @xmath141 , @xmath142 which is the beginning for our calculation .",
    "when rrs crosses the shell ( @xmath143 ) , the shock - accelerated electrons will be in the slow cooling regime if @xmath144",
    ". however , there will be no radiation if @xmath145 , because all the previously shocked electrons have cooled and no newly - shocked electrons are in the shell when @xmath146 .",
    "the break frequencies and peak flux for @xmath144 are @xmath147 we have also derived the self - absorption frequency : in the slow cooling phase , @xmath148 for @xmath149 , and @xmath150 for @xmath151 .",
    "the time for the reverse shocked shell to become non - relativistic , i.e. , when @xmath152 , is @xmath153      before rrs crosses the shell , the forward shocked wind matter moves with the same lorentz factor as the reverse shocked shell matter . whilst most of the initial kinetic energy of the shell has been transferred to the forward shocked matter , as shown in eq .",
    "the forward shock decelerates at a slower rate than the shocked shell does after the crossing time .",
    "we can consider the shocked shell as a tail of the forward shock based on the bm solution with its self - similar parameter @xmath154 , which describes inward motion of the shocked shell relative to the shock front as the shock radius increases .    before rrs crosses the shell ( @xmath103 ) ,",
    "the radiation from the forward shock can be described by @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath157 for @xmath132 , we have the self - absorption frequency @xmath158 and for @xmath134 we have @xmath159 the time for @xmath160 is @xmath161 which is the beginning of our calculation .",
    "since the peak flux of the forward shock emission is comparable to that of the rrs emission , a very early afterglow may be dominated by both of the two regions .",
    "an optical flash may even be dominated by the rrs emission if @xmath33 is very large and @xmath162 is small , which can be estimated by comparing eq .",
    "( 13 ) with eq .",
    "( 21 ) .",
    "the break frequencies and peak flux for @xmath163 are @xmath164 the self - absorption frequency is : ( 1 ) in the fast cooling phase , @xmath165 for @xmath132 , and @xmath166 for @xmath134 ; ( 2 ) in the slow cooling phase , @xmath167 for @xmath168 .",
    "the case of @xmath169 seems impossible before @xmath170 .",
    "the above subsections give the spectral profiles and the decaying laws of the break frequencies .",
    "in this subsection , we will discuss the light curves at some observed frequencies such as @xmath171 hz and @xmath172 ghz .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the flux densities at these two frequencies with fixed parameters of @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 but with @xmath176 varying between 1.0 and @xmath29 , and @xmath162 varying between @xmath177 and 1 , to investigate the effects of energy and wind intensity .",
    "the values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 are consistent with the afterglow of grb @xmath6 ( wijers @xmath2 galama 1999 ; granot , piran @xmath2 sari 1999 ) and the optical flash and afterglow of grb @xmath0 ( wang , dai @xmath2 lu 2000 ) , and @xmath175 is consistent with @xmath180 sec , which is the peak time of the optical flash of grb @xmath0 .",
    "the light curves in six cases and at two frequencies are shown in figures 1 - 6 .",
    "the emission from rrs is nearly comparable or dominant over that from the forward shock at optical frequency .",
    "this is naturally estimated from the ratio of the reversely shocked electron number of the shell to the forward shocked electron number , @xmath181 before rrs crosses the shell , compared with eq.(58 ) of chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) . in detail",
    ", the maximum optical flux in rrs reaches at @xmath182 , @xmath183 when rrs is still in the fast cooling regime , as emphasized by chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) .",
    "the above equation is not suitable for the case of @xmath184 , where rrs enters the slow cooling regime before it crosses the shell , because we can use eqs.(11 ) and ( 12 ) to get the transition time @xmath185 by @xmath186 , @xmath187 for @xmath184 .",
    "the optical flux contributed by the forward shock reaches its maximum at @xmath188 , @xmath189 except in the two cases of @xmath190 and @xmath184 . for these two cases , the optical flux by the forward shock reaches the maximum before rrs has crossed the shell and decays to @xmath191 for more energetic fireball and weaker stellar wind , the emission from rrs becomes more stronger than that from the forward shock .",
    "the weakest rrs case is for @xmath192 ergs , @xmath193 , where the forward shock dominates rrs at @xmath194 by about one order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "the peak flux @xmath195 increases with both @xmath33 and @xmath162 and varies from @xmath196 jy to @xmath197 jy .",
    "an optical flash occurs in all cases , although its properties such as the brightening and decaying timescales and the light curve index may be different from each other .",
    "the time scale of emission with flux above 1 jy ranges from 10 to @xmath198 seconds .",
    "none of the six cases discussed here is consistent with the rapid brightening ( @xmath199 ) and fast decaying ( @xmath200 ) of the optical flash of grb @xmath0 .",
    "this further confirms the result of chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) that the optical flash of grb @xmath0 originates from a homogeneous ism .",
    "the radio afterglow is mainly attributed to radiation from the forward shock and we can neglect the contribution of the emission from rrs .",
    "the light curve indices of the forward shock are @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 from low- to high - frequencies in figs . 1 , 4 and 6 , as shown in chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) .",
    "we also get an index @xmath205 , which does not equal to @xmath206 of chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) at very early times .",
    "indices of 2 , 1 , and 0 in fig . 2 . and fig .",
    "are consistent with the results of chevalier @xmath2 li ( 2000 ) . the peak flux at radio band varies by two orders of magnitude , from @xmath30 to @xmath207 @xmath208jy .",
    "there is a long lasting platform in the radio flux before the forward shock enters the non - relativistic phase ( also see fig . 3 of panaitescu @xmath2 kumar 2000 ) .",
    "it might be used to distinguish the wind environment from the uniform ism environment of grbs and give further hints on the central engine .",
    "we have analyzed very early afterglows in wind environments by considering the radiation from both a relativistic reverse shock and a relativistic forward shock .",
    "the resulting optical flash in the wind case is mainly attributed to rrs because of reduction of the flux from the forward shock by synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "fo more energetic fireball and weaker stellar wind , the optical emission from rrs becomes more stronger than that from the forward shock .",
    "the resulting radio flare is largely produced by the forward shock emission .",
    "theoretically , the peak flux of the optical flash ranges from 1 jy to @xmath29 jy , and the peak time since the grb trigger is tens of seconds , which is determined by the shell width . in our cases",
    "we choose the width according to the typical time scales of long gamma - ray bursts , i.e. , @xmath28 a few tens of seconds .",
    "such a large optical flux at very early times is due to the dense wind at small radius .",
    "if optical observations could be done in a few seconds after the grb trigger , then one can discriminate the wind environment from the uniform ism environment .",
    "it is a challenge for current observational instruments .",
    "while strong optical flashes have been predicted theoretically in this research as well as by many other authors , in realistic observations optical flash has been observed only from grb @xmath0 till now .",
    "the missing of a significant number of strong optical flashes has been interpreted as due to dust obscuration ( soderberg @xmath2 ramirez - ruiz 2002 ) .",
    "we propose that further contribution to the reduction of the optical flash may come from the dense shell around the stellar wind with the column density about @xmath209 @xmath210 ( ramirez - ruiz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "another characteristic of wind environment which might be easier for observations is a long lasting platform in radio flux , which arises from the interaction of the forward shock with the wind matter .",
    "however , dust extinction could not darken a 4th magnitude ( @xmath28 100 jy ) optical flash significantly to be immune to the optical survey .",
    "the non - detections of optical flashes brighter than @xmath28 9th magnitude would eventually constrain the isotropic energies of grbs to be no more than a few @xmath1 ergs and result in relatively weak circum - burst wind intensities with @xmath211 , according to eqs . ( 13 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 27 ) .",

    "<S> the interaction of a relativistic fireball with its ambient medium is described through two shocks : a reverse shock that propagates into the fireball , and a forward shock that propagates into the medium . the observed optical flash of grb @xmath0 has been considered to be the emission from such a reverse shock . </S>",
    "<S> the observational properties of afterglows suggest that the progenitors of some grbs may be massive stars and their surrounding media may be stellar winds . </S>",
    "<S> we here study very early afterglows from the reverse and forward shocks in winds . </S>",
    "<S> an optical flash mainly arises from the relativistic reverse shock while a radio flare is produced by the forward shock . </S>",
    "<S> the peak flux densities of optical flashes are larger than 1 jy for typical parameters , if we do not take into account some appropriate dust obscuration along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the radio flare always has a long lasting constant flux , which will not be covered up by interstellar scintillation . </S>",
