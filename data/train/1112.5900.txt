    "we present in this paper a general approach to study the ricci flow on homogeneous manifolds .",
    "our main tool is a dynamical system defined on a space @xmath0 parameterizing the space of all simply connected homogeneous spaces of dimension @xmath2 with a @xmath3-dimensional isotropy , which is proved to be equivalent in a precise sense to the ricci flow . among some other advantages ,",
    "this setting helps us to better visualize the possible ( nonflat ) pointed limits of ricci flow solutions , under diverse normalizations , as well as to find ancient solutions and determine the type of the singularities .",
    "@xmath0 is a subset of the variety of @xmath1-dimensional lie algebras .",
    "given a homogeneous riemannian manifold @xmath8 , consider the unique homogeneous ricci flow solution @xmath9 starting at @xmath10 , that is , @xmath11 as the ricci flow preserves isometries , any transitive lie group @xmath12 provides , for all @xmath13 , a presentation as a homogeneous space @xmath14 we denote by @xmath15 the @xmath16-invariant metric on @xmath17 determined by its value at the origin @xmath18 , which is an @xmath19-invariant inner product on @xmath20 .",
    "the family @xmath21 is the solution to the ode @xmath22 and thus the maximal interval of time where @xmath9 exists is of the form @xmath23 for some @xmath24 .",
    "this approach seems not to be quite the appropriate one to study certain questions on the ricci flow of homogeneous manifolds , as it confines ourselves to the universe of @xmath16-invariant metrics on @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , the possible limits of normalized ricci flow solutions @xmath26 , as @xmath27 , that we may directly get for different rescalings @xmath28 must all necessarily be @xmath16-invariant metrics of the form @xmath29 for some @xmath30 .",
    "the reason for a family @xmath31 to diverge as @xmath27 can therefore be that it is actually converging to a @xmath32-invariant metric on some other homogeneous space @xmath33 , which might be even non - homeomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "the notion of convergence we mainly use in this paper is the so called pointed or cheeger - gromov convergence .    in order to avoid this restriction",
    ", we propose the following point of view , which can be roughly described as evolving the algebraic side of a homogeneous space rather than its metric .",
    "given @xmath34 as above , we consider for a family @xmath35 of lie brackets the evolution equation , called the _ bracket flow _ ( see section [ lbflow ] ) , defined by @xmath36\\right)\\lb_t , \\qquad \\lb_0=\\;\\mbox{lie bracket of}\\ ; g,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the canonical representation of @xmath38 on @xmath39 given by @xmath40-[\\cdot , a\\cdot ] = \\dds|_0 e^{sa}[e^{-sa}\\cdot , e^{-sa}\\cdot],\\ ] ] and @xmath41 denotes the ricci operator of a homogeneous space @xmath42 which is determined by @xmath43 ( the space @xmath0 mentioned above turns out to be bracket flow invariant ) . here",
    "@xmath44 is the simply connected lie group with lie algebra @xmath45 , the reductive decomposition is always @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the @xmath44-invariant metric on @xmath48 such that @xmath49 ( see section [ varhs ] ) .",
    "we first prove ( see theorem [ eqfl ] ) that there exists a time - dependent family of diffeomorphisms @xmath50 such that @xmath51 moreover , @xmath52 can be chosen as the equivariant diffeomorphism determined by a lie group isomorphism between @xmath16 and @xmath44 with derivative @xmath53:\\ggo\\longrightarrow\\ggo$ ] ( i.e. @xmath54 ) , and the curve @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56_0 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath43 is isomorphic to @xmath57 for all @xmath13 and both the lie bracket on @xmath58 and the isotropy representation remain constant in time ( i.e. @xmath59 ) , so that only @xmath60 is really evolving .",
    "the ricci flow @xmath9 therefore differs from the bracket flow @xmath47 only by pullback by time - dependent diffeomorphisms , and hence the behavior of the curvature is exactly the same along any of them .",
    "as the maximal interval of time where a solution exists also coincides for both flows , it follows that the types of the singularities @xmath61 of the ricci flow solution @xmath9 can be determined by analyzing the bracket flow solution @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , one can for instance find ancient solutions to the ricci flow ( i.e. @xmath62 ) by just showing that @xmath43 ( or its derivative ) remains bounded in the vector space @xmath39 backward in time .",
    "the right rescaling here is given by @xmath63 where the superscripts denote the components on @xmath58 and @xmath64 of @xmath65 , respectively ( see section [ varhs ] ) .",
    "concerning the limit behavior , if @xmath66 , as @xmath67 , then we can apply the results given in @xcite translating this convergence of lie brackets into more geometric notions of convergence , including the pointed topology ( see section [ convergence ] ) .",
    "the new ingredient now is that the limit lie bracket @xmath68 may be non - isomorphic to @xmath43 , providing an explicit limit @xmath69 with a different algebraic presentation and which can often be non - diffeomorphic and even non - homeomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "this approach has been applied to the study of the ricci flow on nilmanifolds in @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for other studies of the ricci flow on nilmanifolds via the bracket flow ( [ bfint ] ) . in the case of @xmath6-dimensional unimodular lie groups , a global picture of the qualitative behavior of the ricci flow",
    "is given in @xcite by using the approach proposed in this paper : to vary lie brackets instead of inner products .",
    "in @xcite , the bracket flow is applied to study the ricci flow for homogeneous manifolds of dimension @xmath70 , and in @xcite to study homogeneous ricci solitons . on the other hand , since the pioneer work @xcite , the ricci flow for homogeneous manifolds has extensively been studied from the standard point of view in dimension @xmath6 ( see @xcite , and for the backward case see @xcite ) and dimension @xmath70 ( see @xcite ) , on lie groups ( see @xcite ) , on flag manifolds ( see @xcite ) and in particular on the @xmath71-dimensional example @xmath72 ( see @xcite ) , where the ricci flow evolves certain positively curved metrics into metrics with mixed ricci curvature .",
    "we give , in propositions [ eqs ] and [ eqsrn ] , the evolution equations the different parts of the ricci curvature obey along the ricci flow and its possible normalizations , which provide a very useful tool in the qualitative analysis of the bracket flow solutions .    in order to illustrate all the aspects of the approach described above , we develop two examples in detail . in section [ exdim3 ]",
    ", we consider a @xmath4-parameter subspace of @xmath5 , which is invariant by the bracket flow and reaches the @xmath6-dimensional geometries @xmath73 , nil , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and some homogeneous spaces isometric to left - invariant invariant metrics on @xmath76 and @xmath77 . a particularly interesting feature in this example is the pointed convergence of the solution on @xmath77 normalized by scalar curvature @xmath78 towards @xmath75 , which can never appear on @xmath79 , the space of all @xmath6-dimensional lie algebras , as @xmath75 is not a unimodular lie group and this is a closed condition on @xmath79 .",
    "secondly , a @xmath4-parameter family in @xmath7 of left - invariant metrics on @xmath2-dimensional semisimple lie groups is studied in section [ exss ] . as a result",
    "we find non - einstein ancient ricci flow solutions on each compact simple lie group different from @xmath80 , and show that the einstein metric which is not bi - invariant represents an unstable point in both the volume and scalar curvature normalized bracket flow systems .",
