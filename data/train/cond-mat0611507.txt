    "under excessive load a rigid body will buckle . a classic analysis of buckling dates to euler who considered a thin rod under compressive stress along its axis . above a critical stress the rod deforms with a wavelength",
    "twice as long as the rod , as the system relieves compressive energy at the expense of bending energy",
    ". variations of euler buckling appear in a range of geometries ; however , under certain constraints , deviations from this behavior occur , and shorter wavelength patterns emerge .",
    "for example , rods subjected to a sudden compression buckle dynamically with a wavelength that scales inversely with the impacting stress  @xcite .",
    "a second example is the buckling of microtubules in biological cells for which the wavelength is reduced due to mechanical coupling to the surrounding cytoskeleton that energetically penalizes large amplitude deviations  @xcite .",
    "a related , well studied phenomenon occurs in the wrinkling of stiff elastic membranes attached to thick soft substrates  @xcite .",
    "stretching of the substrate makes large amplitude , and hence long wavelength , deformations prohibitive , and the membrane wrinkles with a wavelength set by a compromise between the bending and stretching energies .",
    "a number of applications have been advanced that exploit the resulting periodic modulation such as in diffraction gratings  @xcite , stretchable electronics  @xcite and metrological tools  @xcite , indicating the potential of membrane wrinkling as an approach for patterning materials .",
    "( color online ) experimental model of the bilayer membrane , which is comprised of a stiff strip of paint circumscribing an inflated rubber balloon .",
    "( a ) initially , the strip is free of stress and undeformed .",
    "( b ) when the balloon is partially deflated , the strip wrinkles with a uniform wavelength . ]    in order to explore the variety of contexts in which one can controllably wrinkle membranes , we present a model of a bilayer membrane with a constraint that similarly prohibits long wavelength deformations .",
    "the membrane is composed of an inner layer that is a flexible spherical shell and an outer layer that is a stiff strip circumscribing the sphere .",
    "initially , the sphere is stretched under an isotropic tension , while the strip layer is free of stress . when the tension on the sphere is reduced sufficiently , its radius decreases , and",
    "the strip buckles with a well defined wavelength .",
    "we have investigated this bilayer system in simple experiments by applying thin strips of paint around the equator of inflated rubber balloons , as shown in the photograph in fig .",
    "1(a ) . when the air pressure in the balloon is reduced , the strip wrinkles with a wavelength @xmath3 that is much smaller than the radius of the balloon , as illustrated in fig .",
    "comparing measurements of this wavelength with quantitative analytic results , we determine the dependence of @xmath3 on other measurable parameters .",
    "notably , we find that @xmath3 depends on the stiffness of the strip but is independent of the elastic properties of the spherical membrane to lowest order , giving this geometry a potential advantage as a metrological approach for determining the bending modulus of thin stiff films .",
    "we further show how defects in the wrinkling pattern form when the pressure is reduced rapidly .",
    "we also introduce a numerical model for the system , which we employ to explore hierarchical structures that can emerge with large reductions in pressure .",
    "in considering the energetics of the system , we approximate the sphere to be perfectly flexible , so that no bending energy is associated with its deformation , while assuming the strip is inextensible so that its length is conserved .",
    "we further parameterize the distance from the center of the sphere to the strip @xmath4 in polar coordinates , @xmath5 , and assume that the wrinkling instability forms a sinusoidal deformation in the strip , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 specifies the wavenumber .",
    "the objective of the calculation is to determine the wavenumber at the initial instability , where @xmath8 grow infinitesimally from @xmath9 . in particular , we assume @xmath10 for any finite @xmath7 , where @xmath11 is the initial radius of the balloon . in order to find the wavenumber , we need to calculate the total energy of the system to @xmath12 .",
    "the inextensibility of the strip implies that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the element of strip length , @xmath15 , and we make use of the infinitesimal nature of @xmath8 to expand the integrand .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath16    upon reduction of the air pressure in the balloon , the relevant mechanical energy of the bilayer has three separable contributions .",
    "the first is the energy associated with bending the strip , which has the form @xmath17 where @xmath0 is the strip s bending modulus and @xmath18 is the local curvature , @xmath19 inputting eq .",
    "( [ dadl ] ) in ( [ e1 ] ) and again expanding in powers of @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath20 we note that the first harmonic ( @xmath21 ) has zero bending energy because it amounts to a mere shift of the strip in space as long as @xmath22 , and the lowest harmonic affecting the shape of the strip is @xmath23 .",
    "the second contribution to the energy arises from the inward force that the rubber at the edges of the strip applies as the sphere deflates and its equilibrium radius decreases .",
    "this force per unit length ( two - dimensional analog of pressure ) is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the strip and the rubber membrane at the edge of the strip , as illustrated in the inset to fig .",
    "2(a ) , and @xmath1 is the tension of the balloon .",
    "the associated energy is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the area enclosed by the strip .",
    "again , the first harmonic costs no energy because it does not affect the shape of the strip . we note that this expression is strictly correct only prior to the initial instability . after the instability",
    "@xmath28 should acquire an dependence on @xmath29 that could affect the subsequent development of the instability but should not impact the instability wavenumber at the onset .",
    "if the total energy of the bilayer were only @xmath30 , then the minimum energy solution for buckling would correspond to the lowest available harmonic , @xmath23 , and the instability would follow the analog of the euler result for a circle : the strip would buckle into an ellipse .",
    "however , the elastic nature of the sphere changes this situation in a dramatic way because the additional stretching of the membrane introduced by a sinusoidal deformation penalizes large amplitude , long - wavelength deformations . to evaluate this elastic contribution",
    ", we consider the limit where the radius of the balloon is much larger than the width of the strip , so that the region of the rubber membrane affected by the strip can be treated essentially as a cylindrically symmetric system of radius @xmath31 .",
    "the solution we will reach is consistent with this approximation .",
    "as long as the deformations of the membrane are small compared to the radius , the shape of the elastic membrane near the strip will obey laplace s equation @xmath32  @xcite . in cylindrical",
    "coordinates this is @xmath33 where @xmath34 specifies the direction along the balloon perpendicular to the strip and @xmath35 is the local deviation of the distance from the center to the surface of the membrane away from the average radius .",
    "the energy associated with the elastic deformation of the rubber is @xmath36 , % \\ ] ] where @xmath1 is again the tension of the sphere . using the ansatz @xmath37 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ radius ] ) ( with @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , laplace s equation becomes @xmath40 hence @xmath41 .",
    "that is , the deformation of the balloon decays exponentially as a function of distance from the paint strip with decay length @xmath42 , and this result justifies the cylindrical approximation as long as the instability wavenumber @xmath7 is sufficiently large using this solution in the energy of eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) gives @xmath43    therefore , the total energy we must consider is @xmath44 . anticipating that the instability occurs at a high wavenumber we neglect the difference between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this approximation the total energy of the strip to @xmath12 is @xmath47 as a function of @xmath7 , this energy has a minimum at @xmath48 given by the condition @xmath49 .",
    "the instability occurs when @xmath50 .",
    "thus , we obtain the set of equations @xmath51 solving these , we find that the instability occurs at the wavenumber @xmath52 the balloon pulls on the strip at an angle @xmath25 such that @xmath53 the angle is small if @xmath54 .",
    "to compare the wavenumber of the instability predicted by eq .",
    "( [ n0 ] ) with that produced experimentally , we fabricated a set of bilayer membranes like those shown in fig .  1 .",
    "nominally spherical balloons were inflated to an initial pressure of approximately @xmath55 pa , corresponding to an initial radius of approximately 0.15 m. paint ( krylon , `` fusion for plastic '' ) was applied to each balloon in a strip about the equator .",
    "the strip width @xmath56 was kept sufficiently narrow , @xmath57 mm , to neglect the curvature of the balloon across the width . to assure uniform application of the paint ,",
    "each balloon was mounted on a turntable , and the paint was applied with an aerosol spray can positioned 0.3 m from the balloon , while the balloon rotated at an angular velocity of 60 rpm .",
    "paper shields taped to the balloons exposed the 5 mm wide region around the balloons equator to the paint . to tune the thickness and hence the bending rigidity of the strip , the paint was applied in multiple thin coats , with a delay of approximately 2 minutes between each coat for the paint to set .",
    "the final thickness of the paint layers for different balloons was varied between 25 @xmath58 m and 160 @xmath58 m , while the variability in thickness of any individual strip was less than 10% .",
    "after the painting , the balloons were left undisturbed for 18 hours to allow the paint to dry fully . to investigate the wrinkling instability ,",
    "we measured the circumference of the strip to obtain @xmath11 and then slowly released air from each balloon until deformations in the strip appeared like those in fig .",
    "the final air pressure @xmath59 in the balloon was then measured .",
    "a measuring tape was carefully fastened to the balloon parallel to the wrinkled strip , and we determined the final balloon radius @xmath60 , which was typically about 5% smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "digital photographs of the strips were taken , and image analysis was performed to extract the wavelength @xmath3 of the undulations .",
    "measurements of @xmath3 were made at several points around the circumference of each balloon . from these results an average @xmath3 as a function of thickness was obtained .",
    "the bending modulus of a paint strip can be related to its thickness @xmath61 by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the young s modulus and @xmath64 is the poisson ratio  @xcite , which through eq .",

    "the error bars associated with the abscissa in fig",

    "observations of the onset of the instability indicated that the assumption of inextensibility of the strip was not valid at these smallest values of @xmath61 .",
    "specifically , we observed that the wrinkles annealed away moments after their formation , indicating that the thinnest paint layers are able to contract to relieve the stress .",

    "( [ lambda ] ) , labeled @xmath78 , the pattern displays regions with distinctly longer wavelength , such as @xmath79 .",
    "similar defects appear commonly in wrinkling phenomena  @xcite .",
    "their appearance in the strip following rapid deflation suggests that they are a consequence of non - simultaneity of wrinkle nucleation in different regions around the circumference .",
    "when the incommensurate modulations in such different regions meet , the adjoining segments must adopt non - optimal wavelengths to match the regions smoothly .",
    "unfortunately , difficulty in controlling quantitatively the deflation rate at high rates prevented us from investigating this effect in detail .",
    "as the pressure in the balloon is further reduced beyond the onset of the instability , the experiments display one of two effects on the wrinkling pattern . for large paint thickness and hence for large @xmath0 , a uniform pattern persists , and the amplitude of the wrinkles grows until the pattern becomes highly corrugated , as shown in fig .",

    "hence small bending modulus , the deformation remains uniform and becomes highly corrugated , as in ( a ) .",
    "for thick layers and large modulus , a second , longer wavelength instability forms , as in ( b ) . ]    to investigate the emergence of this second generation of wrinkles , we simulate the bilayer with a discrete model similar to one introduced previously to study membrane elasticity  @xcite .",
    "the membrane is approximated by two concentric circular chains of particles .",
    "each chain has @xmath81 particles , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 specifying the position of the @xmath84 particle in the outer and inner chains , respectively .",
    "the bending of the membrane is specified through unit vectors @xmath85 for each particle on the outer chain , where the vector orientation is defined as normal to the line connecting the particle s two nearest neighbors on the chain .",
    "the membrane energy is defined as @xmath86 where the first term sets the bending energy , with @xmath87 determining the bending modulus , and the second term specifies the stretching energy , with spring constants @xmath88 and @xmath89 determining the compression modulus of the inner and outer chains , respectively .",
    "the third term couples each particle to its neighbor in the other chain through a spring force with constant @xmath90 , and the equilibrium bond length @xmath91 sets the thickness of the membrane .",
    "the simulations begin with both chains forming undistorted circles , which minimizes both the bending and stretching energies , and with the inner circle having a radius @xmath92 .",
    "the initial equilibrium bond lengths @xmath93 and @xmath94 are set at values determined by @xmath92 and @xmath91 such that the initial stretching energy is zero . to simulate the shrinkage of the inner layer , we decrease the equilibrium bond length in the inner chain in small steps @xmath95 keeping all other variables constant .",
    "typically , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the initial bond length .",
    "after each step , the particle positions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , are adjusted to minimize the energy , eq .",
    "( [ sim ] ) , using the conjugate gradient method  @xcite .",
    "after a certain number of steps , the circular symmetry is suddenly broken and the membrane deforms with a small amplitude , small wavelength pattern .",
    "this wrinkling is preferred energetically over deformation into an euler - like ellipse because the small wavelength pattern enables the two chains to maintain a larger length difference , thus reducing their respective stretching energies , while avoiding a large separation between chains that would contribute a large energy from the term coupling the chains together .",
    "thus , in the simulations the coupling between the inner and outer chains provides the constraint that prohibits large amplitude deformations .",
    "we find the wrinkling of the simulated membranes displays many of the salient features observed experimentally .",
    "for example , defects like those in fig .",
    "3(b ) develop when the step size for the shrinkage @xmath98 is made large .",
    "the wavelength in the simulations is observed to scale with bending constant as @xmath99 , in contrast to the scaling predicted by eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) and observed in fig .",
    "we ascribe this difference to the extensibility of the outer chain in the simulations , which as described above is expected to alter the scaling .",
    "a detailed description of these findings will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . here , we focus on the behavior as the equilibrium radius of the inner chain is further reduced beyond the onset of the instability . in agreement with experiment ,",
    "the amplitude of the wrinkles grows , and eventually a second generation of longer - wavelength wrinkles suddenly appears only if the bending constant is sufficiently small .",
    "the onsets of the first and second generation instabilities are easily identified by the sudden appearance of pronounced peaks in the fourier power spectrum of the particle displacements .",

    "5 shows examples of such fourier spectra shortly before and immediately after the formation of second generation wrinkles in a simulation .",
    "simulation results for the onset of the wrinkling instability",
    ". the relative strain @xmath100 at which the first generation ( solid ) and second generation ( open ) instabilities occur are displayed as a function of bending constant @xmath87 .",

    "the inset shows the fourier power spectrum of the particle displacements shortly before and immediately after the formation of second generation wrinkles in a simulation using the same parameters except @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the first generation power - spectrum peak ( @xmath108 ) has been scaled by @xmath109 for clarity . ]",
    "figure [ fig5 ] displays the total change in @xmath94 normalized by @xmath97 at which the first and second generation wrinkle patterns appear in a series of simulations with varying bending constant @xmath87 . above a certain value of @xmath87 ,",
    "the second generation of wrinkles never appears , and instead the amplitude of the first generation continues to grow until the simulations break down .",
    "( breakdown occurs when the inner chain passes through the outer chain , reminiscent of the experimental situation at large @xmath0 in which the first generation modulation grows to the point that @xmath5 is no longer single valued . )",
    "strikingly , the strain amplitudes at which the first and second generation wrinkles appear display very similar quasi - power - law dependence on @xmath87 . as suggested previously  @xcite , the membrane with first generation wrinkles can be viewed as a membrane with a larger effective thickness and larger effective bending modulus , which in turn wrinkles with a larger wavelength to create the hierarchical pattern .",
    "the similarity between the curves in fig .",
    "5 lends support to this picture , suggesting that the second generation instability can be mapped to the first through a simple renormalization of @xmath87 that would lead naturally to self - similar structures .",
    "in summary , this simple system of a stiff strip on a spherical membrane has allowed us to investigate in detail a buckling instability in which a constraint enforces a small wavelength deformation . in this case , the constraint derived from the large energy cost of membrane stretching that would accompany an euler - like , large amplitude buckling deformation . as a final perspective on the consequences of this constraint , we note briefly that one can formulate this contribution to the energy in terms of a long - range interaction between local deformations of the different parts of the strip .",
    "specifically , above we analyzed the energy of small fluctuations of the local strip radius @xmath110 for a given harmonic @xmath111 . in a more general case the total energy ( [ e ] )",
    "can be written in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath112 : @xmath113 = 2\\pi r \\int \\frac{\\mathrm d k}{2\\pi } \\left ( b k^4/2 + k^2 -r \\sigma \\sin{\\alpha } + \\sigma |k|\\right)|u_k|^2.\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the position measured along the strip .",
    "the first two terms  the bending and pressure energies  have regular fourier transforms , whereas the elastic term has a kink singularity at @xmath115 . returning to real space",
    "we find that the bending and pressure energies become local terms containing spatial derivatives .",
    "the singular elastic term translates into a long - range interaction : @xmath113 = \\int \\mathrm d l \\left [ \\frac{b}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\mathrm d^2 u}{dl^2 } \\right)^2   - r \\sigma \\sin{\\alpha } \\left ( \\frac{\\mathrm d u}{dl } \\right)^2 \\right ]   + \\sigma \\int dl_1 \\int   dl_2 \\",
    "u(l_1 ) v(l_1 - l_2 ) u(l_2),\\ ] ] where the interaction kernel is @xmath116 and the parameter @xmath117 is an ultraviolet cutoff regularizing the short - distance behavior of the interaction .",
    "this identification of the constraint with an effective long - range interaction suggests a method for mapping such wrinkling phenomena onto other condensed matter systems where competition between long - range and short - range interactions lead to pattern formation , such as for example in the creation of stripe domains in thin ferromagnetic films  @xcite . an interesting direction for further study would be to investigate whether such an approach can aid in understanding and predicting wrinkling behavior in less simple situations and further whether it might lend insight into cases in nature , such as the buckling of biological membranes during growth  @xcite , in which the membranes are observed to wrinkle ."
