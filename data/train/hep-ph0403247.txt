    "what is the connection between the data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from wmap  @xcite and searches for @xmath0 and other charged - lepton flavour - violating ( lfv ) processes ?",
    "one may be provided by sneutrino inflation , an idea first proposed by murayama - san , suzuki - san , yanagida - san and yokoyama - san  @xcite .",
    "this appealing idea languished in obscurity for over a decade , for reasons that are unknown to me .",
    "personally , although i have always been attracted towards inflationary cosmology , i have been reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly , largely because of the absence of a convincing candidate for the inflaton field .",
    "only recently did it dawn upon me that the supersymmetric spin - zero partner of one of the heavy singlet neutrinos in the seesaw might be a suitable candidate .",
    "my interest was then stimulated by the first release of data from the wmap satellite  @xcite , which were consistent with many key inflationary predictions , such as the gaussian nature and almost scale invariance of the primordial density perturbations .",
    "moreover , the wmap data excluded many rival inflationary models , such as those with a simple quartic potential , for example .",
    "last year , raidal , yanagida - san and i  @xcite revived the sneutrino inflation idea , calculated several inflationary observables such as the scalar spectral index ( tilt ) and the magnitude of the tensor perturbations relative to the scalar modes , showed they were consistent with the wmap data , used the model to constrain the seesaw parameters , and finally calculated lfv processes showing , for example , that @xmath0 might occur not far below the present experimental limit .",
    "more recently , chankowski , pokorski , raidal , turzynski and i  @xcite have explored in more detail the sneutrino inflation predictions for lfv processes .",
    "this talk is based on these two papers .    first , however , i summarize the basic features of inflation  @xcite",
    ". then i recall the 18 parameters of the minimal three - generation seesaw model  @xcite , and how they appear in low - energy lfv observables as well as neutrino oscillations and leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "then i compare the predictions of sneutrino inflation  @xcite with wmap data  @xcite and recall that the gravitino problem  @xcite favours non - thermal scenarios for leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "finally , i dissect  @xcite the predictions of sneutrino inflation for various lfv processes  @xcite , showing how they follow from the ( near ) decoupling of the sneutrino inflaton , which is motivated by the gravitino problem and some approaches to neutrino masses within the seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of cosmological inflation  @xcite is that , at some early epoch in the history of the universe , its energy density may have been dominated by an almost constant term :    @xmath4    leading to a phase of near - exponential de sitter expansion .",
    "it is easy to see that the second ( curvature ) term in ( [ infv ] ) rapidly becomes negligible , and that @xmath5 during this inflationary expansion , if @xmath6 is really constant .    in this case , the _ horizon _ would also have expanded ( near- ) exponentially , so that the entire visible universe might have been within our pre - inflationary horizon : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of e - foldings during inflation .",
    "this would have enabled our observable universe to appear ( almost ) homogeneous .",
    "since the @xmath9 term in ( [ infv ] ) becomes negligible , the universe may now appear almost _ flat _ with @xmath10 .",
    "however , as we see later , perturbations during inflation generate a small deviation from unity : @xmath11 . following inflation",
    ", the conversion of the inflationary vacuum energy into particles reheats the universe , filling it with the required entropy .",
    "finally , the closest pre - inflationary monopole or gravitino is pushed away , further than the origin of the cmb , by the exponential expansion of the universe .",
    "the above description is quite classical .",
    "in fact , one should expect quantum fluctuations in the initial value of the inflaton field @xmath12 , which would cause the inflationary expansion to be slightly inhomogeneous  @xcite , with different parts of the universe expanding at slightly different rates .",
    "these quantum fluctuations would give rise to a gaussian random field of density perturbations with similar magnitudes on different scale sizes , just as the astrophysicists have long wanted  @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of these perturbations would be linked to the value of the effective potential during inflation , and would be visible in the cmb as adiabatic temperature fluctuations  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a typical vacuum energy scale during inflation .",
    "consistency with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from cobe _",
    "et al_. , that find @xmath15 , is obtained if @xmath16 comparable with the gut scale .",
    "one example of such a scenario is chaotic inflation  @xcite , according to which there is no special structure in the effective potential @xmath17 , which might be a simple power @xmath18 or exponential @xmath19 . in this scenario ,",
    "any given region of the universe is assumed to start with some random value of the inflaton field @xmath12 and hence the potential @xmath17 , which decreases monotonically to zero .",
    "the equation of motion of the inflaton field is @xmath20 and ( our part of ) the universe undergoes sufficient expansion if the initial value of @xmath17 is large enough , and the potential flat enough . the first term in ( [ motion ] ) is assumed to be negligible , in which case the equation of motion is dominated by the second ( hubble drag ) term , and one has @xmath21 in this slow - roll approximation , @xmath12 rolls slowly down the potential if @xmath22 are all @xmath23 , where @xmath24  gev .",
    "various observable quantities can then be expressed in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath26  @xcite , including the spectral index for scalar density perturbations : @xmath27 the ratio of scalar and tensor perturbations at the quadrupole scale : @xmath28 the spectral index of the tensor perturbations : @xmath29 and the running parameter for the scalar spectral index : @xmath30 + 2 \\xi . \\label{running}\\ ] ] the amount @xmath31 by which the universe expanded during inflation is also controlled  @xcite by the slow - roll parameter @xmath32 : @xmath33 in order to explain the size of a feature in the observed universe , one needs : @xmath34 where @xmath35 characterizes the size of the feature , @xmath36 is the magnitude of the inflaton potential when the feature left the horizon , @xmath37 is the magnitude of the inflaton potential at the end of inflation , and @xmath38 is the density of the universe immediately following reheating after inflation .    as an example of the above general slow - roll theory , let us consider chaotic inflation  @xcite with a @xmath39 potential , as appears in the sneutrino inflation model  @xcite discussed later . in this model ,",
    "the conventional slow - roll inflationary parameters are @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the _ a priori _ unknown inflaton field value during inflation at a typical cmb scale @xmath35 .",
    "the overall scale of the inflationary potential is normalized by the wmap data on density fluctuations : @xmath42 yielding @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 in any simple chaotic @xmath45 inflationary model .",
    "the above expression ( [ amount ] ) for the number of e - foldings after the generation of the cmb density fluctuations observed by cobe could be as low as @xmath46 for a reheating temperature @xmath47 as low as @xmath48  gev . in the @xmath45 inflationary model ,",
    "this value of @xmath49 would imply @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath51 inserting this requirement into the wmap normalization condition ( [ wmap ] ) , we find  @xcite the following required mass for any inflaton with a simple quadratic potential : @xmath52 this is comfortably within the range of heavy singlet ( s)neutrino masses usually considered , namely @xmath53 to @xmath54  gev , motivating the sneutrino inflation model discussed below",
    ".    is this simple @xmath45 model compatible with the wmap data ? it predicts the following values for the primary cmb observables  @xcite : the scalar spectral index @xmath55 the tensor - to scalar ratio @xmath56 and the running parameter for the scalar spectral index : @xmath57 the value of @xmath58 extracted from wmap data depends whether , for example , one combines them with other cmb and/or large - scale structure data .",
    "however , the @xmath45 model value @xmath59 appears to be compatible with the data at the 1-@xmath60 level  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 model value @xmath61 for the relative tensor strength is also compatible with the wmap data .",
    "in fact , we note that the favoured individual values for @xmath62 and @xmath63 reported in an independent analysis  @xcite all coincide with the @xmath45 model values , within the latter s errors !    one of the most interesting features of the wmap analysis is the possibility that @xmath63 might differ from zero  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 model value @xmath64 derived above is negligible compared with the wmap preferred value and its uncertainties .",
    "however , @xmath65 still appears to be compatible with the wmap analysis at the 2-@xmath60 level or better , so we do not regard this as a death - knell for the @xmath45 model .",
    "on the other hand , all higher - order power - law potentials @xmath66 do seem to be excluded by the wmap data  @xcite .",
    "a generic seesaw model has a mass matrix  @xcite : @xmath67 where each of the entries should be understood as a matrix in generation space . in order to provide",
    "the two measured differences in neutrino masses - squared , there must be at least two non - zero masses , and hence at least two heavy singlet neutrinos @xmath68  @xcite . presumably , all three light neutrino masses are non - zero , in which case there must be at least three @xmath68 .",
    "this is indeed what happens in simple gut models such as so(10 ) , but some models  @xcite have more singlet neutrinos  @xcite . here ,",
    "for simplicity we consider just three @xmath68 .",
    "the effective mass matrix for light neutrinos in the seesaw model may be written as : @xmath69 where we have used the relation @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "taking @xmath72 or @xmath73 and requiring light neutrino masses @xmath74 to @xmath75  ev , we find that heavy singlet neutrinos weighing @xmath76 to @xmath54  gev seem to be favoured , comparable with the @xmath45 inflaton mass inferred above cmb data .",
    "it is convenient to work in the field basis where the charged - lepton masses @xmath77 and the heavy singlet - neutrino mases @xmath78 are real and diagonal .",
    "the seesaw neutrino mass matrix @xmath79 ( [ seesawmass ] ) may then be diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xmath80 : @xmath81 this diagonalization is reminiscent of that required for the quark mass matrices in the standard model . in that case , it is well known that one can redefine the phases of the quark fields  @xcite so that the mixing matrix @xmath82 has just one cp - violating phase  @xcite . however , in the neutrino case , there are fewer independent field phases , and one is left with 3 physical cp - violating parameters : @xmath83 here @xmath84 is the light - neutrino mixing matrix first considered by maki , nakagawa and sakata ( mns )  @xcite , and @xmath85 contains 2 cp - violating phases @xmath86 that are in principle observable at low energies , e.g. , in neutrinoless double-@xmath87 decay .",
    "the mns matrix describing neutrino oscillations may be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "the cp - violating phase @xmath90 could in principle be measured by comparing the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos and computing the cp - violating asymmetry  @xcite : @xmath91 the measurement of @xmath90 is the holy grail of neutrino - oscillation physics , but does it have anything to do with leptogenesis , as has often been hoped ?",
    "the answer is ` no ' , unless one makes some supplementary hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "we have seen above that the effective low - energy mass matrix for the light neutrinos contains 9 parameters , 3 mass eigenvalues , 3 real mixing angles and 3 cp - violating phases . however , these are not all the parameters in the minimal seesaw model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , this model has a total of 18 parameters  @xcite .",
    "the additional 9 parameters comprise the 3 masses of the heavy singlet ` right - handed ' neutrinos @xmath92 , 3 more real mixing angles and 3 more cp - violating phases .    to see how the extra 9 parameters appear  @xcite , we reconsider the full lepton sector , assuming that we have diagonalized the charged - lepton mass matrix : @xmath93 as well as that of the heavy singlet neutrinos : @xmath94 we can then parametrize the neutrino dirac coupling matrix @xmath95 in terms of its real and diagonal eigenvalues and unitary rotation matrices : @xmath96 where @xmath97 has 3 mixing angles and one cp - violating phase , just like the ckm matrix , and we can write @xmath98 in the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 also resembles the ckm matrix , with 3 mixing angles and one cp - violating phase , and the diagonal matrices @xmath101 each have two cp - violating phases : @xmath102 in this parametrization",

    "the extra seesaw parameters contribute to the renormalization of soft supersymmetry - breaking masses , via a combination which depends on just 1 cp - violating phase .",
    "however , two more phases appear in higher orders , when one allows the heavy singlet neutrinos to be non - degenerate  @xcite . some of these extra parameters may also have controlled the generation of matter in the universe via leptogenesis  @xcite .",
