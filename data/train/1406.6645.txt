    "* ) performed an all - sky survey in the thermal infrared , imaging each field of view simultaneously in four infrared wavelengths during the fully cryogenic portion of the mission and in the two shortest wavelengths when the mission continued as the near - earth object wise survey ( neowise , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the four wise bandpasses are referred to as w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , and cover the wavelength ranges of @xmath6 m , @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , and @xmath9 m respectively , with photometric central wavelengths of @xmath4 m , @xmath5 m , @xmath10 m , and @xmath11 m respectively @xcite .",
    "the single - frame wise / neowise data allow us to investigate the thermal emission and reflectance properties of the minor planets of the solar system .",
    "due to their proximity to the sun , near - earth objects ( objects with perihelia @xmath12au ) are typically dominated by thermal emission in w2 ( and occasionally even in w1 ) , while for more distant objects w2 measures a combination of reflected and emitted light and w1 is dominated by reflected light . for all minor planets observed by neowise , bands w3 and w4 are dominated by thermal emission .",
    "measurements of the thermal emission from asteroids can be used to determine the diameter of these bodies through the application of thermal models such as the near earth asteroid thermal model ( neatm , * ? ? ?",
    "neatm assumes that the asteroid is a non - rotating sphere with no emission from the night side , and a variable beaming parameter ( @xmath13 ) is used to account for variability in thermophysical properties and phase effects .",
    "neatm provides a rapid method of determining diameter from thermal emission data that is reliable to @xmath14 when the beaming parameter can be fit @xcite .",
    "visible light measurements available from the minor planet center ( mpc ) can then be combined with these models to constrain the geometric albedo at visible wavelengths ( @xmath15 ) . however , as these data are not simultaneous with the thermal infrared measurements , uncertainties due to rotation phase , observing geometry , and photometric phase behavior instill significant systematic errors in @xmath15 determinations .",
    "the preliminary asteroid thermal fits presented in @xcite for the near - earth objects , main belt asteroids , hildas , and jupiter trojans account for these uncertainties in the determination of the optical @xmath16 magnitude resulting in a larger relative error on albedo than is found for diameter .    for objects that were observed by neowise in both thermal emission and near - infrared ( nir ) reflected light",
    ", we can simultaneously constrain the diameter as well as the nir albedo . as these data were taken at the same time and observing conditions as the thermal data used to model the diameter , no assumptions are needed regarding the photometric phase behavior of these objects , and light curve changes from rotation or viewing geometry do not contribute to the uncertainty .",
    "these nir albedos will thus be a more precise indicator of the surface properties than the visible albedos .",
    "the behavior of the nir region of an asteroid s reflectance spectrum can be used as a probe of the composition of the surface .",
    "spectra of asteroids in the nir have been used for taxonomic classification @xcite , to constrain surface mineralogy @xcite , and to search for water in the solar system @xcite .",
    "near - infrared albedo measurements have also been used to identify candidate metal - rich objects in the neo population @xcite .",
    "@xcite use the ratio of the nir and visible albedos as a proxy for spectral slope , and show a correspondence between this ratio and various taxonomic classifications .",
    "this relation was used by @xcite to determine preliminary classifications for neos , while @xcite and @xcite expanded upon this technique to taxonomically classify hilda and jupiter trojan asteroids .",
    "@xcite presented nir albedo measurements of main belt asteroids assuming that the albedos at the w1 and w2 wavelengths were identical .",
    "however , for objects that have a sufficient number of detections of reflected light in multiple nir bands we can independently constrain each albedo ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the w1 and w2 bandpasses respectively ) . in this work ,",
    "we present new thermal model fits of the nir albedos of main belt asteroids ( mbas ) , allowing @xmath17 and @xmath18 to vary independently .",
    "these albedos allow us to better distinguish different mba compositional classes .",
    "they are also particularly useful for investigations of collisional families seen in the main belt , which show strongly correlated physical properties within each family .",
    "to fit for nir albedos of main belt asteroids , we use data from wise / neowise all - sky single exposure source table , which are available for download from the infrared science archive ( irsa * ? ? ?",

    "we follow the fitting technique described in @xcite to independently determine the albedos in bands w1 and w2 .",
    "this technique uses a faceted sphere with a temperature distribution drawn from the neatm model to calculate the predicted visible and infrared magnitudes for each object .",

    "monte carlo simulations of the data using the measurement errors then provide a constraint on the uncertainty of each parameter .",
    "we require at least three detections in each band above snr=4 to use that band in our fit .",
    "main belt asteroids are typically closer to the sun at the time of observation than the trojans and hildas discussed in @xcite , and thus the measured w2 flux can have a larger contribution of thermal emission for mbas .",
    "flux in the w1 band is typically dominated by reflected light for mbas observed by wise , although low albedo objects ( @xmath19 ) at heliocentric distances of @xmath20au can be thermally dominated in w1 as well .    in order to ensure reliable fits for w2 albedos ( @xmath18 )",
    ", we require that the beaming parameter be fit by the model .",
    "the beaming parameter is a variable in the neatm fit that consolidates uncertainties in the model due to viewing geometries and surface thermophysical parameters , and can be characterized as an enhancement of the thermal emission in the direction of the sun .",
    "changes in thermal properties or phase angles will lead to a range of possible beaming parameters for mbas . in order to fit the beaming parameter",
    ", our model requires detections of thermal emission in two bands .",
    "we also require that the fraction of flux in w2 from reflected light be at least @xmath21 of the total flux measured to fit @xmath18 .",
    "while this should be sufficient to constrain the w2 albedo in most cases , uncertainty in the beaming parameter can lead to large uncertainties in @xmath18 . to fit w1 albedo ( @xmath17 )",
    ", we followed the same procedure for @xmath18 , except now requiring the w1 reflected light to be at least @xmath22 of the total flux .",
    "all objects that fulfilled the above requirements had optically measured magnitudes available in the literature , and thus allowed us to fit a visible albedo as well .",
    "we present our updated thermal model fits for all objects satisfying the above constraints in table  [ tab.fits ] , where we give the object s name in mpc - packed format , absolute @xmath23 magnitude and @xmath24 photometric slope parameter from the mpc orbit file , associated family from @xcite ( or `` ...

    "these objects are either too small to reflect a detectable amount of light in w2 , may be dominated by thermal emission in w2 ( common for low albedo objects , @xmath39 ) , or may have a blue spectral slope over the @xmath40 m range and thus `` drop out '' of w2 .",
    "each of these scenarios will have a different implication for interpreting the distribution of w2 albedos , most notably that our data are least sensitive to smaller , lower albedo objects , as well as objects with blue @xmath15-@xmath18 or @xmath17-@xmath18 spectral slopes .",
    "interpretation of the distribution of nir albedos or spectral slopes , particularly as a function of taxonomy or size , must thus be made with the appropriate caveats .",

    "visible albedos for over @xmath47 main belt asteroids were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these measurements were based on the conversion of apparent visible magnitudes from a wide range of predominantly ground - based surveys to absolute @xmath23 magnitudes when the orbit was determined by the mpc .",
    "absolute magnitude is then converted to a predicted apparent magnitude during the epoch of the wise / neowise observations , often after assuming a photometric @xmath24 parameter ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and assuming rotational variations are averaged over during the set of thermal infrared observations .",
    "these conversions and assumptions will instill additional uncertainty in the @xmath15 determinations beyond what would be expected from uncertainties in the flux measurements and from thermal modeling . as a result ,",
    "the fractional error on @xmath15 is typically @xmath48 larger than the fractional error on diameter from thermal model fits .",

    ", we see that our sample contains significantly fewer low albedo objects than would be expected from a random sample of all main belt asteroids .",

    "following @xcite , we can use our albedo measurements as a proxy for spectral slope from visible wavelengths through the nir .",
    "objects that fall above the 1-to-1 relationship in the top portion of figure  [ fig.scatalb ] will have a red spectral slope across the wavelengths plotted , while objects below this relation will have a blue spectral slope . as @xmath18 is the most poorly probed of the three parameters",
    ", there will be inherent detection biases against blue spectral slopes from objects that `` drop out '' and fall below our w2 detection threshold .",
    "for this reason objects with the bluest slopes , particularly low - albedo objects , will be under - represented in our fits of @xmath18 .    to better compare the spectral slope information , in figure  [ fig.slopecomp ] we show the difference in albedo between @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 normalized to the measured @xmath17 value .",
    "objects with positive values have a red spectral slope , while objects with negative values have a blue slope .",
    "high albedo objects ( @xmath49 ) tend to show red slopes from visible to w1 wavelengths , and then blue slopes between w1 and w2 .",
    "this behavior is similar to what is observed for eucrite meteorites at these wavelengths @xcite , and what would be expected from extrapolating a typical s - type asteroid spectrum @xcite .",

    "from @xcite we find that the majority of our blue sloped objects that have bus - demeo taxonomic classifications are identified as b or ch class objects , the latter of which represents a fraction of the spectroscopic sample comparable to the fraction of our sample in this group .",

    "the diameter and albedo fits from @xcite rely on the same model and assumptions as we use here , and so comparisons between the two populations should only depend on the random error associated with the fits .",

    "one object , ( 1755 ) lorbach , is identified as an s - type in @xcite , but this classification relies on only two optical colors .",
    "for the outer main belt , we do not see a significant population of d - type objects like what is observed in the hildas and trojans @xcite , but this is expected from the lower efficiency of dynamical implantation compared with the hilda and trojan populations @xcite .",

    "there are occasional objects with other classifications such as x- , f- and s- , or dual classifications , although often in these cases the designation is based on only 2 color indices and so is of low reliability .",
    "it is possible that this group could represent a different class of objects that is not found in the more distant solar system populations , or instead could be a failure of the thermal model to converge for certain objects with low albedos .",
    "in order to test if these objects are a result of a failure of the fitting routine , we take all objects in our fitted population with @xmath39 and compare the set with @xmath58 to the set with @xmath59 ( referred to as `` low - high '' and `` low - low '' respectively ) .",

    "the primary difference between these two groups is that the low - high objects have significantly smaller heliocentric distances at the time of observation than the low - low objects , resulting in higher subsolar temperatures .",
    "the diameters of the low - high objects are also characteristically smaller than those of the low - low group , however we can not distinguish if this is an actual difference between the groups or is a change in sensitivity as a result of the low - high objects being closer to the sun and telescope at the time of observation , and thus warmer and brighter .",
    "the asteroid ( 656 ) beagle is a particularly interesting case for testing the differences between these two sets of objects .",

    "one epoch of observations results in a neatm best - fit that falls into the low - low group , while the other epoch falls into the low - high group .",
    "the low - high epoch data were taken when beagle was @xmath60 au closer to the sun ( @xmath61au vs @xmath62au for the low - low case ) , following the trend seen for the overall population .",
    "the best - fit for neatm in the low - high epoch has a beaming parameter of @xmath63 and a diameter of @xmath64 km while the low - low epoch has best - fit values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 km which is the reverse of the diameter trend mentioned above .",
    "this large disagreement in diameter is not unexpected given the difference in best - fit beaming parameter which is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the subsolar temperature used in the neatm model , and thus will change the model s emitted flux .",
    "the observations used for our fits were visually inspected , as well as compared to the wise all - sky atlas of stationary sources , and show no significant contamination by background stars or galaxies .",
    "we note that ( 656 ) beagle has a large amplitude lightcurve ( a@xmath67mag ) and a period of @xmath68hours @xcite .",
    "although large amplitudes can increase uncertainty in the fits , our data consist of 12 data points over @xmath69 day and 15 data points over @xmath70 days , so both epochs cover multiple rotations .",
    "as such , light curve variations should be averaged over by our fits , and should only contribute a small amount to the total uncertainty in the fit .",
    "as a test of our model , we perform a neatm fit using only bands w1 , w2 , and w3 as constraints , assuming the w4 measurements are anomalously high , and a fixed beaming parameter of @xmath71 .",
    "when using a fixed beaming parameter we can not adequately constrain @xmath18 , and so assume it is equal to @xmath17 . for these restricted fits ,",
    "both epochs converge to diameters that agree to within @xmath21 , but they can not reproduce the measured magnitudes as well as the full - fit case .",
    "as we are using one fewer constraint but two fewer variables , this is not surprising .",
    "the fits for ( 656 ) beagle given by @xcite are nearly identical to these restricted fits , but also can not fully reproduce the measured magnitudes , particularly for the low - high epoch . restricting our model further and only fitting w1 and w3 , we find that both epochs converge to nearly identical diameters , and visible and infrared albedos .",
    "we can understand these results by looking at where the best - fit model deviates from the data .",
    "for the low - high epoch , the full neatm fit can not reproduce the w2 , w3 , and w4 fluxes simultaneously , with the w2 and w4 measurements showing excesses not observed in w3 .",
    "our full model finds a best fit solution allowing w3 and w4 to determine the diameter and beaming which under - produces flux in w2 , but corrects that by increasing @xmath18 .",
    "if we ignore the w4 measurements , the w2 and w3 fluxes still can not be reproduced in the low - high epoch solely with thermal emission and reflected light without resorting to extreme changes in @xmath18 .",
    "one possible explanation for the disagreement between epochs is that we are observing significant differences between the thermal emission in the morning and afternoon hemispheres of the asteroid .",
    "if ( 656 ) beagle has a relatively high thermal inertia , there may be a significant lag to the thermal re - emission of incident light which is not accounted for in the neatm model .",
    "our two epochs of observation are at phase angles of @xmath72 , but on opposite sides of the body .",
    "( 656 ) beagle is on a low - inclination orbit , so if we assume the rotation pole is oriented perpendicular to the orbital and ecliptic planes and that the rotation is prograde , then the data from the low - high epoch would correspond to the afternoon hemisphere and the data from the low - low epoch would correspond to the morning hemisphere .",
    "future work will implement a full thermophysical model of this object to test if the w2 and w4 excesses can be explained by a morning / afternoon dichotomy . for all other objects in the low - high group which were only observed at a single epoch",
    ", we can not currently differentiate between poor fits to the beaming parameter and actual excesses in the w2 and/or w4 bands .",
    "an alternate possibility is that these fits are indicative of problems with the flux measurement of partially saturated sources in the wise data . @xcite",
    "discuss the process by which fluxes are measured for saturated sources through psf - fitting photometry .",
    "flux measurements are available for sources many magnitudes above the brightness where the central pixel saturates through fitting of the psf wings , however for very bright sources in bands w2 and w3 , there appears to be a slight over - estimation of the fluxes .",
    "none of the objects we fit here had w2 magnitudes in this saturated regime , however the majority of objects with @xmath39 had w3 magnitudes in this problematic region .",
    "we correct for saturation estimation issues in our thermal model , however there is the potential that the error for asteroidal sources can not be adequately described by this correction , which was calibrated for stars .",
    "the difference in the spectral energy distributions through the w3 bandpass of hot , blue stars and cooler , red asteroids potentially could result in differences deep in the wings of the psf for each type of source that are not fully encompassed by the color correction .",
    "these subtle changes can have a significant impact on saturated sources where only the wings are available for profile - fitting , however there are an insufficient number of well - calibrated , w3-bright sources with the appropriate spectral energy distribution to correct for this effect .",
    "although this error may only have a small effect on other physical parameters within our modeled systematic uncertainties , due to w2 s position on the wien s side of main belt asteroid thermal emission for some of our objects , a small change in w3 can result in a large change in w2 flux , and thus our interpretation of the w2 albedo .",
    "as such , caution is strongly encouraged in interpreting fits for objects with very bright w3 magnitudes ( w3@xmath73mag ) .",
    "the distributions of visible albedos for members of each asteroid family have much narrower spread than the albedo distribution of the main belt as a whole @xcite as is expected from a population resulting from the collisional breakup of a single parent body . as the ( 4 )",
    "vesta family shows a narrow albedo distribution but originated from a differentiated body , we do not expect the albedo distributions of other cratering - event families that may have been partially- or fully - melted to differ significantly from non - differentiated families .",
    "it is possible that families formed from the complete disruption of a differentiated parent body may show a broader albedo distribution , though we do not see any evidence for a case like this in our data .",
    "visible albedo can also be used to improve family membership lists by rejecting outlier objects that are dynamically similar to the family @xcite . using the refined family lists from @xcite we investigate the distribution of @xmath17 for families as a more accurate tracer of the surface properties of these asteroids .",

    "asteroid families break into three clear groupings , following the three peaks in the albedo distribution shown in figure  [ fig.scatalb ] .",
    "our dataset depends on reflected light measurements , so high - albedo families are over - represented in the distribution compared with the population of all known families , which is dominated by low - albedo families .",
    "the only low nir - albedo family with more than @xmath75 measured objects was ( 24 ) themis , however other families such as ( 10 ) hygiea , ( 145 ) adeona , ( 276 ) adelheid , ( 511 ) davida , ( 554 ) peraga ( equivalent to other lists polana family ) , and ( 1306 ) scythia also show low nir albedos , but these families contain only a small number of objects with measured @xmath17 .",
    "the families ( 4 ) vesta , ( 8) flora , ( 15 ) eunomia , ( 208 ) lacrimosa , ( 472 ) roma , and ( 2595 ) gudiachvili all have high @xmath17 and show only a small spread in mean albedo , while ( 135 ) hertha ( equivalent to other lists nysa family ) and ( 254 ) augusta join them at a lower significance level .",
    "the ( 221 ) eos family is the only one of the large families to have a moderate nir albedo , in between the high- and low - albedo populations , indicating that this family has surface properties that are rare among the large main belt asteroids .",
    "the @xmath17 values for this family confirm the observed moderate visible albedo as a separate grouping that could not be conclusively distinguished from the high @xmath15 population by @xcite .",
    "the eos family parent has a k - type spectral taxonomy in the bus - demeo system @xcite .",
    "k - type objects are considered ` end - members ' of the classification scheme , and have a @xmath76 m absorption feature typically associated with silicates such as olivine , but are distinct in spectroscopic principal component space from the majority of s - class objects . @xcite and @xcite associate k - type objects with the parent body of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites , specifically co chondrites , while @xcite show evidence that ( 221 ) eos may have been partially differentiated .",
    "@xcite calculate the time since the breakup of the ( 221 ) eos family as @xmath77gyr , making it one of the oldest main belt families with a measured age .",
    "these observed properties , when taken together , paint the eos family as having a unique evolutionary history that can be studied using remote observations in combination with hand samples from the meteorite record to trace the early history of the solar system .     asteroid families with more than @xmath75 measured nir albedos , identified by the family i d given in @xcite and table  [ tab.famprop ] .",
    "families show narrow distributions of albedos correlating with one of three major albedo groupings . ]",
    "we note that approximately half of the objects fit for the ( 298 ) baptistina family had albedos similar to the eos family , while the remainder appear to be drawn from the high - albedo group .",
    "this result is based on only a small number of measured baptistina members , and thus is not conclusive , however if confirmed would further impede attempts to assign a unique composition to this family ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or determine its age and evolution ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig.eifamback ] shows the proper orbital eccentricity and inclination of all objects with measured @xmath17 .",
    "the main belt is split into three regions by proper semi - major axis ( @xmath78 ) : the inner - main belt ( imb , @xmath79au@xmath80au ) , the middle - main belt ( mmb , @xmath81au@xmath82au ) , and the outer - main belt ( omb , @xmath61au@xmath83au ) .",
    "we show separately the objects that were associated with an asteroid family by @xcite and those that are members of the background population .",
    "the ( 221 ) eos family stands out distinctly in the belt , although objects with similar @xmath17 are present in the background population in all three regions .",
    "these plots show the clear trend of albedo decreasing with distance from the sun , however our observational bias against small , low albedo objects amplifies this effect .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observe halos of objects beyond the limits of typical family - identification techniques , however we do not see evidence for these halos in the background population in our dataset .",
    "halos are typically associated with asteroids that have dispersed a large distance from the family center via yarkovsky and gravitational forces , which will have smaller diameters than objects that were above our sensitivity limit for @xmath17 determination .",
    "our significantly smaller sample size than what is typically used in surveys investigating family halos may also contribute to their absence in our data .    ) , following figure  [ fig.w1alb]a . ]    in table  [ tab.famprop ] we present the orbital and physical properties for all families identified in @xcite that had at least one member with a fitted nir albedo .",
    "we list the name of the family , average proper orbital elements , largest ( d@xmath84 ) and smallest diameter ( d@xmath85 ) represented in our sample , w1 albedos with standard deviations , and number of family members with data sufficient to fit .",
    "we also provide for reference the mean @xmath15 and standard deviation from @xcite . for cases where only a single body had a measured @xmath17 ( often but not always the parent body of the family ) ,",
    "d@xmath85 is marked with a ` ... ' entry and no standard deviation is given for the mean w1 albedo for families with less than 10 members .",
    "asteroids that have been incorrectly associated with families may have very different mineralogies and thus spectral behavior in the nir , which could make those objects more likely to fulfill the selection requirements for measured @xmath17 .",
    "thus , particular caution is necessary when dealing with families suffering small number statistics , especially families with only a single @xmath17-fit object .",
    "we note that the mean @xmath15 albedos presented in @xcite are based on larger numbers of objects and so will generally be more accurate than the mean @xmath17 values given here .",
    "it is also possible to use the w1 albedo to further refine family memberships , particularly for confused cases such as the nysa - polana complex .",
    "@xcite divided this complex into a high albedo component with largest body ( 135 ) hertha and a low albedo component with largest body ( 554 ) peraga which is nearly twice the diameter of ( 142 ) polana .",
    "we use nir albedo to reject objects from the low - albedo family that had moderate visible albedos but w1 albedos characteristic of the high - albedo family .",
    "asteroids ( 261 ) , ( 1823 ) , ( 2717 ) , and ( 15112 ) can thus be rejected as members of the ( 554 ) peraga group based on w1 albedo .",
    "we note that because of a typo in @xcite ( 135 ) hertha was mistakenly listed as associated with ( 554 ) peraga instead of with its own family , which we correct here .",
    "@xcite present dynamical arguments to divide the ( 554 ) peraga family into two sub - families , however we are unable to see any distinction between these groups in visible or w1 albedo .    [ tab.famprop ]",
    "we present revised thermal model fits for main belt asteroids , allowing for the albedo in each of the near - infrared reflected wavelengths to be fit independently .",
    "the @xmath4 m and @xmath5 m spectral regions covered by the wise / neowise w1 and w2 bandpasses are poorly probed in ground - based spectroscopy but can be used to provide insight into asteroid mineralogical composition by constraining spectral slope . in total",
    "we present @xmath26 fits of @xmath17 and/or @xmath18 for @xmath0 unique main belt objects .",
    "the mba population has three distinct peaks in our observed @xmath17 distribution at @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the high and low @xmath17 peaks correspond to the high and low visible albedo groups observed previously , while the moderate @xmath17 peak corresponds to an intermediate visible albedo that is blended with the high @xmath15 objects in visible albedo distributions .",
    "the distribution of albedos we measure have a larger fraction of high - albedo objects than what was observed for the mba visible albedo distribution , however this is an effect of the biases in our sample selection .",
    "asteroid families have narrow @xmath17 distributions corresponding to one of the three observed @xmath17 peaks .",
    "the ( 221 ) eos family represents the only significant concentration of objects near the peak at @xmath45 , although other objects with this albedo that are not related to asteroid families are scattered throughout the entire main belt region .",
    "this family also corresponds to an unusual ` end member ' taxonomic classification , k - type , that has been suggested to correspond to a partially differentiated parent or olivine - rich mineralogy .",
    "nir albedo measurements provide a way to rapidly search the known population for candidate k - type objects in the main belt , and are a powerful tool that acts as a proxy for asteroid taxonomic type .",
    "our results show that the majority of high albedo objects , believed to have surface compositions dominated by silicates and similar to ordinary chondrite meteorites , show an overall reddening from visible to w1 wavelengths similar to what is seen in the nir .",
    "the spectra become blue from w1 to w2 , which is also seen in some meteorite populations , particularly the eucrites .",
    "this overall picture is consistent with a primarily - silicate dominated composition .",
    "objects with moderate infrared albedos show similar behavior across the wavelengths probed here , although the lower albedo value at w1 may indicate subtle differences in composition from the high albedo population or even a mix of different mineralogies .",
    "the low albedo objects in our sample show a much wider range of behavior in these spectral regions . many object show red slopes across all wavelengths consistent with the nir spectral behavior of c / d / p - type objects .",
    "however approximately @xmath21 of our population show a blue slope from visible to w1 , even in spite of the biases against blue - sloped , low - albedo objects in our sample .",
    "these objects are associated with b and ch spectral taxonomies .",
    "the blue visible - to - w1 spectral slope in the ch class objects may be indicative of a significant absorption feature at w1 wavelengths from minerals such as carbonates .",
    "the fits presented here are based on reflected light , and thus our sample will not accurately represent the true distribution of @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "small , low albedo asteroids as well as objects with blue nir spectral slopes are more likely to be undetected in the w1 and/or w2 wavelengths and thus underrepresented in our population distributions . a larger survey with greater sensitivity in these spectral regions",
    "is required to extend these results to a population comparable to the one with measured diameters and visible albedos .",

    "<S> these fits are derived from reflected - light near - infrared images taken simultaneously with thermal emission measurements , allowing for more accurate measurements of the near - infrared albedos than is possible for visible albedo measurements . as our sample requires reflected light measurements , it undersamples small , low albedo asteroids , as well as those with blue spectral slopes across the wavelengths investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the main belt separates into three distinct groups of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 reflectance at @xmath4 m . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the @xmath5 m albedo distribution spans the full range of possible values with no clear grouping . </S>",
    "<S> asteroid families show a narrow distribution of @xmath4 m albedos within each family that map to one of the three observed groupings , with the ( 221 ) eos family being the sole family associated with the @xmath2 reflectance @xmath4 m albedo group . </S>",
    "<S> we show that near - infrared albedos derived from simultaneous thermal emission and reflected light measurements are an important indicator of asteroid taxonomy and can identify interesting targets for spectroscopic followup . </S>"
