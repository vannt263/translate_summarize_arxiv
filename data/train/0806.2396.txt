    "it is interesting to compare the results for tiobr and tiocl with typical examples of bandwidth - controlled mott transitions under external pressure , which are discussed in literature .",
    "one finds the general observation that the mott transition coincides with volume discontinuities or even changes of the crystal symmetry .",
    "this applies , for example , to the canonical mott - hubbard systems vo@xmath13 ( ref .  ) and vanadium sesquioxide doped with chromium , ( v@xmath56cr@xmath57)@xmath13o@xmath58,@xcite and also to mno,@xcite ynio@xmath58,@xcite fe@xmath13o@xmath58,@xcite or fei@xmath13.@xcite it was even suggested that as a rule the mott transition coincides with a structural phase transition and volume collapse.@xcite our finding of a pressure - induced structural phase transition in tiobr and tiocl at the same pressure where the mott - hubbard gap closes , is in agreement with such an interpretation of the mott - hubbard transition .    the importance of electronic correlations for the underlying mechanism of the observed gap closure in tio@xmath1 is suggested by the effective mass of the charge carriers , as estimated from the spectral weight analysis . as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ transmittance ] , for both tiobr and tiocl the spectral weight becomes pressure - independent above a certain pressure [ see inset of fig . [ fig : cond - all ] and fig .",
    "4(b ) in ref . ] . from the high - pressure value of the spectral weight one can estimate an effective density of charge carriers according to eq .",
    "( [ carrierdensity]),@xcite averaged over the two studied crystal directions , to @xmath26=@xmath59@xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 for tiobr and @xmath26=@xmath63@xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 for tiocl for the same frequency range.@xcite based on these values the effective number of charge carriers per ti atom , @xmath64 , can in principle be calculated , if the unit cell volume and the number of formula units per unit cell are known . for an estimate of @xmath64 we assumed a high - pressure volume of 93 @xmath48 ( 82 @xmath48 ) and a number of formula units per unit cell of @xmath65=2 ( @xmath65=2 ) for tiobr ( tiocl ) .",
    "hereby , we neglected the change of the crystal symmetry and a possible collapse of the unit cell volume at the insulator - to - metal transition ; the latter effect usually ranges between 1 and 10 % .",
    "@xcite under these assumptions we obtained @xmath64=0.03 @xmath510.01 for tiobr and @xmath64=0.05 @xmath510.01 in the case of tiocl .",
    "i. e. , @xmath64 is much lower than the expected value of 1 .    one possible explanation for the reduced value of @xmath64 could be that the charge carriers only partly contribute to the excitations in the specified frequency range .",
    "in addition , the reduction might be related to an enhanced effective mass of the charge carriers , typically found in materials with strong electronic correlations .",
    "the mass enhancement in tio@xmath1 might get stronger when the system approaches the mott insulating state , as suggested by the suppressed carrier density with decreasing pressure [ see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cond - all ] and fig .",
    "4(b ) in ref . ] .",
    "a mass enhancement in the vicinity of a transition to a mott insulator was theoretically predicted @xcite and observed in some cases .",
    "@xcite    in order to understand the main mechanism driving the observed closure of the mott - hubbard gap , the crystal structure of the high - pressure phase might be an important piece of information .",
    "however , up to now we could not resolve the symmetry of the crystal structure at high pressures . in this",
    "regard , density - functional calculations @xcite might provide predictions which could then be tested on our x - ray diffraction data .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the possibility of the metallic character of the high - pressure phase in tio@xmath1 . based on our data",
    "we can not prove the existence of a drude term in the optical response related to coherent quasiparticles at high pressures.@xcite it was , however , demonstrated theoretically and experimentally in various cases , that above a certain temperature the absence of a drude term in a correlated system located on the metallic side of the mott transition is to be expected : a lot of theoretical work has been devoted to the transport properties of systems close to the first - order mott transition at low temperatures and in the crossover regime at elevated temperatures .",
    "optical conductivity spectra for different interaction strengths and different temperatures were obtained in a dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) treatment of the hubbard model.@xcite it was shown that only below a certain temperature @xmath66 a quasiparticle peak involving coherent excitations appears at the fermi energy and the fermi liquid description applies .",
    "as a result , only at low temperatures ( @xmath21@xmath4@xmath66 ) a drude term should be present in the optical conductivity spectrum . with increasing temperature , the quasiparticle peak is gradually destroyed and disappears above the temperature @xmath66 .",
    "such a behavior was demonstrated for the two - dimensional organic charge - transfer salts @xmath67-(bedt - ttf)@xmath13cu[n(cn)@xmath13]br@xmath69cl@xmath70:@xcite even for a high br content , i.e. , on the metallic side of the mott transition , no drude - like peak is present down to approx .  50  k. only below this temperature a drude - like feature appears , which can be described with an extended drude model , with a frequency - dependent scattering rate and effective mass .",
    "the optical conductivity spectra of tio@xmath1 as a function of pressure were obtained at room temperature . according to the findings for organic salts",
    "mentioned above and in other cases , @xcite the seeming absence of a drude - like contribution in the optical response of tio@xmath1 at high pressures could be explained by the elevated measurement temperature .",
    "still , the metallic state appears to be the most plausible high - pressure phase for tio@xmath1 based on our experimental results .",
    "the shape of the optical conductivity spectra at high pressures is , however , an open issue .",
    "furthermore , a direct proof of the drude response might be obtainable by pressure - dependent reflectance measurements carried out at low temperatures .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the pressure - dependent optical response of tiobr and tiocl at room temperature by transmittance and reflectance measurements in combination with pressure - dependent x - ray powder diffraction experiments . for both compounds",
    "the infrared transmittance is suppressed above a critical pressure .",
    "the pressure - dependent reflectance and corresponding optical conductivity spectra reveal additional electronic excitations at high pressures extending down to the far - infrared range .",
    "these findings suggest the closure of the mott - hubbard gap under pressure .",
    "for tiobr the pressure - induced suppression of the infrared transmittance also occurs at 23  k , where the compounds is in the spin - peierls phase at ambient pressure .",
    "the orbital excitations in tiobr shift linearly to higher frequency with increasing pressure .",
    "the shifts are not completely reversible upon pressure release , especially at low temperatures .",
    "the pressure - induced changes occur at somewhat lower pressure in the case of tiobr compared to tiocl .",
    "this difference can not be attributed to the more two - dimensional character of tiobr , since according to the ratio of the crystal parameters @xmath9 and @xmath3 the system becomes more one - dimensional under pressure , i.e. , the high - pressure state seems to be rather of one - dimenisonal than of two - dimensional character .",
    "the closure of the mott - hubbard gap coincides with a structural phase transition . from the results of our pressure - dependent x - ray powder diffraction measurements on tiobr and tiocl",
    "we could furthermore extract the pressure - dependence of the lattice parameters and of the unit cell volume .",
    "the latter can be well described by the murnaghan equation .",
    "the enhancement of the effective mass of the charge carriers around the critical pressure suggests the importance of electronic correlations for the mechanism driving the transition .",
    "however , the lattice degree of freedom seems to play in important role as well , since the crystal symmetry changes at the transition pressure .",
