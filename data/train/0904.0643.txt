    "sensory devices often receive signals from multiple physical stimuli that evolve simultaneously but are unrelated to one another . in many of these situations ,",
    "it is necessary to create separate representations of one or more of these stimuli by blindly processing the observed signals ( i.e. , by processing them without prior knowledge of the nature of the stimuli ) . in recent years , there has be considerable progress in the solution of this  blind source separation \" ( bss ) problem for the special case in which the signals and source variables are linearly related .",
    "however , although nonlinear bss is often performed effortlessly by humans , computational methods for doing this are quite limited  @xcite .    consider a time series of data @xmath0 , where @xmath3 is a multiplet of @xmath5 measurements ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the usual objectives of nonlinear bss are : 1 ) determine if these data are instantaneous mixtures of @xmath5 statistically independent source components @xmath1 @xmath7 , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a possibly nonlinear , invertible @xmath9 mixing function ; 2 ) if this is the case , compute the mixing function .",
    "in other words , the problem is to find a coordinate transformation @xmath10 that transforms the observed data @xmath0 from the measurement - defined coordinate system ( @xmath3 ) on state space to a special source coordinate system ( @xmath11 ) in which the components of the transformed data are statistically independent .",
    "let @xmath12 be the state space probability density function ( pdf ) in the source coordinate system , defined so that @xmath13 is the fraction of total time that the source trajectory @xmath1 is located within the volume element @xmath14 at location @xmath11 . in the usual formulation of the bss problem ,",
    "the source components are required to be statistically independent in the sense that their state space pdf is the product of the density functions of the individual components @xmath15 in every formulation of bss , multiple solutions can be created by permutations and component - wise transformations of any one solution .",
    "however , it is well known that the criterion in ( [ state space factorization ] ) is so weak that it suffers from a much worse non - uniqueness problem : namely , in this form of the bss problem , multiple solutions can be created by transformations that mix the source variables ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the issue of non - uniqueness can be circumvented by considering the data s trajectory in @xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) instead of @xmath17 ( i.e. , state space ) .",
    "first , let @xmath18 be the pdf in this space , defined so that @xmath19 is the fraction of total time that the location and velocity of the source trajectory are within the volume element @xmath20 at location @xmath21 .",
    "an earlier paper  @xcite described a formulation of the bss problem in which this pdf was required to be the product of the density functions of the individual components @xmath22 separability in @xmath2 is a stronger requirement than separability in state space . to see this , note",
    "that ( [ state space factorization ] ) can be recovered by integrating both sides of ( [ phase space factorization ] ) over all velocities , but the latter equation can not be deduced from the former one .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that ( [ phase space factorization ] ) is strong enough to guarantee that the bss problem in @xmath2 has a unique solution , up to permutations and component - wise transformations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this type of statistical independence has the virtue of being satisfied by almost all classical physical systems that are composed of non - interacting subsystems , which are the generators of most signals of interest .",
    "the author previously demonstrated  @xcite that the @xmath2 pdf of a time series induces a riemannian geometry on the state space , with the metric equal to the local second - order correlation matrix of the data s velocity .",
    "nonlinear bss can be performed by computing this metric in the @xmath3 coordinate system ( i.e. , by computing the second - order correlation of @xmath4 at each point @xmath3 ) , as well as its first and second derivatives with respect to @xmath3 . however , although this is a mathematically correct and complete method of solving the nonlinear bss problem , it suffers from a practical difficulty : namely , if the dimensionality of state space is high , a great deal of data is required to cover it densely enough in order to calculate these derivatives accurately .",
    "the current paper  @xcite shows how to perform nonlinear bss by computing higher - order local correlations of the data s velocity , instead of computing derivatives of its second - order correlation .",
    "this approach is advantageous because it requires much less data for an accurate computation .",
    "for example , in the synthetic speech separation experiment in section iii , the new method can separate two synthetic utterances recorded with a single microphone after minutes of observation , rather than the hours of observation required by the differential geometric method .",
    "the method described in this paper differs significantly from the methods proposed by other investigators because it uses a criterion of statistical independence in @xmath2 , instead of state space .",
    "in addition , there are technical differences between the proposed method and conventional ones .",
    "first of all , the technique in this paper exploits statistical constraints on the data that are _ locally _ defined in state space , in contrast to the usual criteria for statistical independence that are _ global _ conditions on the data time series or its time derivatives  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , unlike many other methods  @xcite , the mixing function is derived in a constructive , deterministic , and non - parametric manner , without employing iterative algorithms , without using probabilistic learning methods , and without parameterizing it with a neural network architecture or other means .",
    "in addition , the proposed method can handle any differentiable mixing function , unlike some other techniques that only apply to a restricted class of mixing functions  @xcite .",
    "the next section describes how to separate two - dimensional data into two one - dimensional source variables .",
    "section iii illustrates the method by using it to separate two simultaneous speech - like sounds that are recorded with a single microphone .",
    "the implications of this work are discussed in the last section .",
    "the appendix describes how the method can be generalized to separate data of arbitrary dimensionality into possibly multidimensional source variables .",
    "the bss procedure , which is described in this section , is initiated by constructing scalar functions on the data space from combinations of local velocity correlations .",
    "the values of these scalars are invariant under any nonlinear transformations of coordinates on the data space .",
    "it is relatively easy to show that separability imposes necessary conditions on these scalar functions in the source coordinate system . because of their scalarity",
    ", these conditions can readily be transferred to the measurement - defined coordinate system ( @xmath3 ) , where they can be tested with the data .",
    "if the data do not satisfy these necessary conditions , the data are simply not separable .",
    "if the data do satisfy these conditions , we show that there is only one possible source coordinate system , and it can be explicitly constructed .",
    "the data can then be transformed into this putative source coordinate system to see if their pdf and/or correlations factorize there .",
    "the data are separable if and only if this factorization occurs .",
    "the first step is to construct local correlations of the data s velocity , such as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , where the bracket denotes the time average over the trajectory s segments in a small neighborhood of @xmath3 , where @xmath25 , and where  @xmath26 \" denotes possible additional indices on the left side and corresponding factors of @xmath27 on the right side .",
    "the definition of the pdf implies that this velocity correlation is one of its moments @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pdf in the @xmath3 coordinate system .",
    "incidentally , although ( [ pdf moment ] ) is useful in a formal sense , in practical applications , all required correlation functions can be computed directly from local time averages of the data ( ( [ c definition ] ) ) , without explicitly computing the data s pdf . also , note that velocity  correlations \" with a single subscript vanish identically .    next , let @xmath30 be a local @xmath31 matrix , and use it to define @xmath32 velocity correlations @xmath33 where ",
    "@xmath26 \" denotes possible additional indices of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as well as corresponding factors of @xmath30 .",
    "because @xmath36 is positive definite at any point @xmath3 , it is always possible to find an @xmath30 such that @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a diagonal @xmath31 matrix .",
    "such an @xmath30 can always be constructed from the product of three matrices : 1 ) a rotation that diagonalizes @xmath36 , 2 ) a diagonal rescaling matrix that transforms this diagonalized correlation into the identity matrix , 3 ) another rotation that diagonalizes @xmath40 after the fourth - order correlation has been transformed by the first rotation and the rescaling matrix . as long as the last - diagonalized matrix is not degenerate",
    ", @xmath30 is unique , up to arbitrary _ local _ permutations and reflections . in almost all realistic applications , the velocity correlations will be continuous functions of the state space coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , in any neighborhood of state space , there will always be a continuous solution for @xmath30 , and this solution is unique , up to arbitrary _",
    "global _ reflections and permutations .    in order to show that the @xmath32 velocity correlations ( i.e. , the @xmath41 ) transform like scalars , imagine constructing these quantities in some other coordinate system @xmath42 .",
    "an @xmath43 that satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath42 coordinate system is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a matrix that satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) in the @xmath3 coordinate system . to prove this , substitute this equation into the definition of @xmath46 . because velocity correlations transform as contravariant tensors , the partial derivative factors within @xmath47 transform correlations from the @xmath42 coordinate system to the @xmath3 coordinate system , leading to @xmath48 therefore , because @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfy ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) , so do @xmath51 and @xmath52 , thereby proving that ( [ m ] ) is one of the solutions for @xmath53 in the @xmath42 coordinate system .",
    "all other solutions for @xmath53 differ from this one by global reflections and permutations .",
    "similar reasoning shows that , for any choice of @xmath47 and @xmath45 , each of the functions @xmath46 equals the corresponding function @xmath54 , up to possible global permutations and reflections . in other words , @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes an element of a product of permutation , reflection , and identity matrices . in other words , the functions @xmath54",
    "transform as scalar functions on the state space , except for possible reflections and index permutations .",
    "we now assume that the system is separable and derive some necessary conditions on these scalar functions in the source coordinate system ( @xmath11 ) . because these separability conditions involve scalar functions , they",
    "can then be transferred to the measurement - defined coordinate system ( @xmath3 ) , where they can be tested with the data . in order to make the notation simple",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath57 in the following .",
    "however , the appendix describes how the methodology can be generalized in order to separate higher - dimensional data into possibly multidimensional source variables .",
    "separability implies that there is a transformation @xmath10 from the @xmath3 coordinate system to a source coordinate system ( @xmath11 ) in which ( [ phase space factorization ] ) is true .",
    "because of ( [ pdf moment ] ) , the velocity correlation functions in the @xmath11 coordinate system are products of correlations of the independent sources @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote arbitrary numbers of indices equal to 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "it follows from this equation and from the vanishing of all velocity  correlations \" with one index that the source variable correlations @xmath61 and @xmath62 are diagonal .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath11 coordinate system , ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) are satisfied by a diagonal matrix @xmath63 of the form @xmath64 it follows from ( [ c = c1 c2 ] ) and ( [ diagonal ms ] ) that the scalar functions @xmath65 with all subscripts @xmath66 equal to 1 ( 2 ) must equal the corresponding functions derived for subsystem 1 ( 2 ) , and these latter functions depend on @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) alone .",
    "although these constraints were derived in the @xmath11 coordinate system , scalarity ( ( [ i = pi ] ) ) implies that these separability conditions are true in all coordinate systems , except for possible permutations and reflections .",
    "therefore , in the measurement - defined coordinate system ( @xmath3 ) , the functions @xmath54 with all subscripts equal to 1 must be functions of either @xmath69 _ or _ @xmath70 .",
    "likewise , the functions @xmath54 with all subscripts equal to 2 must be functions of the other source variable ( @xmath70 or @xmath69 , respectively ) .",
    "this coordinate - system - independent consequence of separability can be used to perform nonlinear bss in the following manner :    1 .",
    "use ( [ c definition ] ) to compute velocity correlations @xmath71 from the data @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   use linear algebra to find a continuous matrix @xmath30 that satisfies ( [ m definition 1 ] ) and ( [ m definition 2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   use ( [ i definition ] ) to compute the functions @xmath54 .",
    "4 .   plot the values of the triplets @xmath72 @xmath73 as @xmath3 varies over the measurement - defined coordinate system .",
    "if the plotted values of @xmath74 and/or @xmath75 _ do not _ lie in one - dimensional subspaces within the three - dimensional space of the plots , @xmath76 and/or @xmath77 can not be functions of single source components ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) as required by separability , and the data are not separable .",
    "if the plotted values of both @xmath74 and @xmath75 _ do _ lie on one - dimensional manifolds , define one - dimensional coordinates ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively ) on those subspaces .",
    "then , compute the function @xmath80 that maps each coordinate @xmath3 onto the value of @xmath81 , which parameterizes the point @xmath82 . notice that , because of the takens embedding theorem  @xcite , @xmath3 is invertibly related to the six components of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and , therefore , it is invertibly related to @xmath81 .",
    "transform the pdf ( or correlations ) of the measurements from the @xmath3 coordinate system to the @xmath81 coordinate system .",
    "the data are separable if and only if the pdf factorizes ( the correlations factorize ) in the @xmath81 coordinate system .",
    "the last statement can be understood in the following manner . as shown above",
    ", separability implies that @xmath76 must be a function of a single source variable ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) , and the takens theorem implies that this function is invertible .",
    "because @xmath74 is also an invertible function of @xmath78 , it follows that @xmath78 must be invertibly related to one of the source variables , and , in a similar manner , @xmath79 must be invertibly related to the other source variable .",
    "thus , separability implies that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are themselves source variables .",
    "it follows that the data are separable if and only if the pdf factorizes in the @xmath81 coordinate system .    although the above - described procedure will perform bss for any mixing function , it is interesting to consider the special case in which source variables exist that are linearly related to the measurements ; namely , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant @xmath85 matrix .",
    "in general , the above bss procedure will construct source variables @xmath81 that are related to these  linear \" source variables by @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are some invertible nonlinear transformations determined by the choice of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 coordinates , respectively .",
    "therefore , at each point @xmath3 the partial derivatives @xmath91 will be proportional to constant ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) vectors ( denoted by @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) , which are themselves proportional to the first and second rows of @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , these vectors can be used to construct other linearly - related source variables @xmath95 that are just rescaled versions of the ones in ( [ s = wx ] ) . consequently ,",
    "given the source variables @xmath96 produced by the bss procedure , the following process can be used to determine whether these can be transformed into source variables that are linearly related to the measurements : 1 ) compute the above - mentioned partial derivatives and determine if each is proportional to an @xmath92 vector ; 2 ) if the partial derivatives do not satisfy this condition , there are no linearly - related source variables ; 3 ) if the partial derivative do satisfy condition 1 , transform the data into the @xmath97 coordinate system in order to see if the data s pdf factorizes there .",
    "there are linearly - related source variables if and only if this factorization occurs .",
    "this section describes a numerical experiment in which two speech - like sounds were synthesized and then summed , as if they were simultaneously recorded with a single microphone .",
    "each sound simulated an  utterance \" of a vocal tract resembling a human vocal tract , except that : 1 ) it had one degree of freedom , instead of the 3 - 5 degrees of freedom of the human vocal tract ; 2 ) its impulse response was characterized by one pole pair , instead of the 4 - 6 pole pairs characteristic of the human vocal tract .",
    "the methodology of section ii was blindly applied to a time series of two features extracted from the synthetic recording , in order to recover the time dependence of the state variable of each vocal tract ( up to an unknown transformation on each voice s state space ) .",
    "bss was performed with only 16 minutes of data , instead of the hours of data required to separate similar sounds using a differential geometric method  @xcite .",
    "each speaker was simulated by having a simulated glottis drive a simulated resonant cavity that represented the vocal tract .",
    "the glottal waveform of the each  voice \" was a series of spikes separated by a pitch interval ( 100 hz and 160 hz ) .",
    "the impulse response of each  vocal tract \" was taken to be a characteristic damped sinusoid , whose amplitude , resonant frequency , and damping were linear functions of a single state variable . for each voice ,",
    "a 16 minute utterance was produced by convolving its glottal waveform with the impulse response of its vocal tract , which was a function of a slowly - varying state variable .",
    "the state variable time series of each voice was synthesized by smoothly interpolating among successive states .",
    "the latter were chosen at 100 - 120 msec intervals so that the state variable time series of the two voices were statistically independent of each other .",
    "the resulting utterances had energies differing by 2.4 db , and they were summed and sampled at 16 khz with 16-bit depth .",
    "then , this ",
    "recorded \" waveform was pre - emphasized and subjected to a short - term fourier transform ( using frames with 25 msec length and 5 msec spacing ) .",
    "the log energies of a bank of 12 mel - frequency filters between 0 - 8000 hz were computed for each frame , and these were then averaged over pairs of consecutive frames .",
    "these log filterbank outputs were nonlinear functions of the two vocal tract state variables .    in order to blindly analyze these data , we first determined if any data components were redundant in the sense that they were simply functions of other components .",
    "[ figure1]a shows the first three principal components of the log filterbank outputs during a typical short recording of the simultaneous utterances .",
    "inspection showed that these data lay on a curved two - dimensional surface within the ambient 12-d space , making it apparent that they were produced by a  hidden \" dynamical system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the redundant components were eliminated by using dimensional reduction ( principal components analysis in small overlapping neighborhoods of the data ) to establish a coordinate system @xmath3 on this surface and to find @xmath0 , the trajectory of the recorded sound in that coordinate system .",
    "next , the bss procedure in section ii was used to determine if @xmath0 was a nonlinear mixture of two source variables that were statistically independent of one another . following steps 1 - 4 of the bss procedure , @xmath0 of the entire recording",
    "was used to compute invariants @xmath54 with up to five indices , and the related functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 were plotted , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figure1]b - c .",
    "it was evident that the plotted values of both @xmath74 and @xmath75 lay in or close to one - dimensional subspaces .",
    "following step 6 of the bss procedure , a dimensional reduction procedure  @xcite was used to define coordinates ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) on these one - dimensional manifolds , and @xmath80 was computed . if the data were separable , @xmath81 must be a set of source variables , and @xmath98 $ ] must describe the evolution of the underlying vocal tract states ( up to invertible component - wise transformations ) . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figure2]a - b and figs .",
    "[ figure3]a - b , the time courses of the putative source variables ( @xmath99,\\sigma_b[x(t)]$ ] ) did resemble distorted versions of the state variable time series that were originally used to generate the voices utterances .",
    "the scatter plots in fig .",
    "[ figure2]c and fig .",
    "[ figure3]c show that , in each case , the recovered source variable and the corresponding state variable were related by a nonlinear transformation that was nearly monotonic , except for the effects of noise due to the limited number of data samples .",
    "thus , starting with a single - microphone recording , the bss procedure was able to extract the information encoded in the time series of each speaker s state variable .",
    "the time course of the analogous multidimensional state variable of the human vocal tract contains the speech content of each utterance .",
    "this indicates that the bss procedure is capable of recovering the speech content of superposed utterances , without recovering their original waveforms .",
    "in a previous paper  @xcite , the nonlinear bss problem was reformulated in ( state , state velocity)-space , instead of state space as in conventional formulations .",
    "this approach is attractive because : 1 ) the reformulated bss problem has a unique solution in the following sense : either the data are inseparable , or they can be separated by a mixing function that is unique ( up to permutations and transformations of independent source variables ) ; 2 ) statistical independence in ( state , state velocity)-space is manifested by almost all classical physical systems that are composed of non - interacting subsystems .",
    "this paper  @xcite shows how a general solution of this problem can be constructed in a deterministic manner , which avoids the difficulties of the iterative , probabilistic , and parametric bss techniques proposed by other investigators .",
    "furthermore , an accurate computation can be performed with far less data than that required by the differential geometric solution , previously proposed by the author  @xcite .",
    "the bss procedure in section ii shows how to compute @xmath100 , \\sigma_b[x(t)])$ ] , the trajectory of each independent subsystem in a specific coordinate system on that subsystem s state space . in many practical applications ,",
    "a pattern recognition  engine \" has been trained to recognize the meaning of trajectories of one subsystem ( e.g. ,  @xmath101 \" ) in another coordinate system ( e.g. , @xmath102 ) on that subsystem s state space . in order to use this information ,",
    "it is necessary to know the transformation to this particular coordinate system ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "for example , subsystem @xmath101 may be the vocal tract of speaker @xmath101 , and subsystem @xmath104 may be a noise generator of some sort . in this example , we may have trained an automatic speech recognition ( asr ) engine on the quiet speech of speaker @xmath101 ( or , equivalently , on the quiet speech of another speaker who mimics @xmath101 in the sense that their state space trajectories are related by an invertible transformation when they speak the same utterances ) . in order to recognize the speaker s utterances in the presence of @xmath104 , we must know the transformation from the vocal tract coordinates recovered by bss ( @xmath78 ) to the coordinates used to train the asr engine ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this mapping can be determined by using the training data to compute more than @xmath105 invariants ( like those in ( [ i definition ] ) ) as functions of @xmath102 .",
    "these must equal the invariants of one of the subsystems identified by the bss procedure , up to a global permutation and/or reflection ( ( [ i = pi ] ) ) .",
    "this global transformation can be determined by permuting and reflecting the distribution of invariants produced by the training data , until it matches the distribution of invariants of one of the subsystems produced by the bss procedure .",
    "then , the mapping @xmath103 can be determined by finding paired values of @xmath78 and @xmath102 that correspond to the same invariant values within these matching distributions .",
    "this type of analysis of human speech data is currently underway .",
    "the procedure in section ii is capable of separating two - dimensional data into one - dimensional source variables .",
    "this appendix describes the solution of the more general nonlinear bss problem in which data of any dimensionality may be separated into possibly multidimensional source variables , each of which is statistically independent of the others but each of which may contain statistically dependent components .",

    "then , compute the function @xmath139 that maps each coordinate @xmath3 onto the value of @xmath81 , which parameterizes the point @xmath82 .",
    "notice that , because of the takens embedding theorem  @xcite , @xmath3 is invertibly related to the @xmath140 ( or more ) components of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and , therefore , it is invertibly related to @xmath81 . 7 .",
    "transform the pdf ( or correlations ) of the measurements from the @xmath3 coordinate system to the @xmath81 coordinate system .",
    "the data are separable , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are source variables if and only if the pdf factorizes ( the correlations factorize ) in a @xmath81 coordinate system created in this way .    the last statement can be understood in the following manner . as shown above , separability implies that , for some choice of @xmath108 and index partitioning , @xmath76 must be a function of @xmath133 , and the takens theorem implies that this function is invertible . because @xmath74 is also an invertible function of @xmath78 , it follows that @xmath78 must be invertibly related to @xmath102 , and , in a similar manner , @xmath79 must be invertibly related to @xmath109 .",
    "thus , separability implies that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are themselves source variables and , therefore , the pdf factorizes in the @xmath81 coordinate system .",
    "finally , note that , if the data are separable , the same procedure can then be used to determine if each multicomponent source variable ( @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) can be further separated into lower - dimensional source variables .",
    "the above - described procedure will perform bss for any linear or nonlinear mixing .",
    "however , a few comments should be made about the special case in which source variables exist that are linearly related to the measurements ; namely , @xmath141 @xmath142 where @xmath114 , where @xmath143 , and where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are constant @xmath146 and @xmath147 matrices , respectively . in general",
    ", the above bss procedure will construct source variables @xmath81 that are related to these  linear \" source variables by @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are some nonlinear transformations ( with @xmath108 and @xmath132 components , respectively ) , determined by the choice of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 coordinates , respectively .",
    "therefore , at each point @xmath3 , the sets of partial derivatives @xmath151 will be lie in the subspace spanned by the rows of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( for @xmath114 and @xmath143 ) denote any sets of constant vectors that span these two subspaces .",
    "then , another set of linearly - related source variables is given by @xmath154 which are just linear combinations of the ones in ( [ sa = wax ] ) and ( [ sb = wbx ] ) , respectively .",
    "consequently , given the source variables @xmath96 produced by the bss procedure , the following process can be used to determine whether these can be transformed into source variables that are linearly related to the measurements : 1 ) compute the above - mentioned sets of partial derivatives and determine if each set is spanned by the appropriate number of @xmath92 vectors ; 2 ) if one or both sets of partial derivatives do not satisfy this condition , there are no linearly - related source variables ; 3 ) if both sets of partial derivative do satisfy condition 1 , transform the data into the @xmath97 coordinate system in order to see if the data s pdf factorizes there .",
    "there are linearly - related source variables if and only if this factorization occurs .",
