    "a static electric field @xmath1 applied to an insulating material induces a dipole , @xmath2 , whose magnitude depends on the polarizability , @xmath3 , and hyperpolarizabilities , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ... , of the system .",
    "large ( hyper-)polarizabilities imply easy redistribution of electronic or nuclear charge by the field . for isolated molecules in the gas phase ,",
    "the formal theory of static polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities is well known , and accurate results can be obtained from quantum chemical calculations on simple molecules.@xcite for complex molecular structures the calculation becomes challenging , particularly in large @xmath6conjugated molecules , where important contributions to ( hyper-)polarizabilities are expected from molecular vibrations.@xcite for molecules in solution the polarization of the solvent screens the applied fields and the calculation of ( hyper-)polarizabilities becomes fairly involved.@xcite    in the solid state , and particularly in crystals , the definition of the dipole moment itself is challenging , and a formal theory for the polarization , @xmath7 , the dipole moment for unit cell , was developed only in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the polarization of the material apparently depends on the choice of the unit cell.@xcite this problem finds a natural solution in the so - called berry - phase formulation of @xmath7 , that relates the macroscopic polarization of the crystal to the ground state ( gs ) wavefunction rather than to the gs charge - density .",
    "@xcite a key concept in the modern theory of polarization is that @xmath7 is by itself ill - defined and not accessible experimentally : only _ variations _ of @xmath7 can in fact be defined as independent of boundary - conditions , and are experimentally accessible.@xcite the berry - phase formulation of polarizability in insulating materials constitutes an important advance in understanding the electrical properties of crystalline materials , but does not solve the problem of the definition of a dipole moment operator in systems with periodic boundary conditions.@xcite a complete and coherent picture for the polarizability ( and hyperpolarizability ) of crystalline materials is still lacking .",
    "the berry - phase definition of @xmath7 is particularly important in covalent insulators , i.e. in crystals such as oxides or silicon , where the charge density is sizeable even between atoms . in organic molecular crystals , by contrast , the overlap between electronic wavefunctions on different molecules is small and there is an unambiguous natural way of partitioning the crystal into an assembly of neutral , localized unit cells ( the so - called clausius - mossotti limit ) .",
    "@xcite in the zero overlap approximation for charge - densities on different molecules , the dipole moment operator for the crystal is simply the sum of the dipole moments of the basic unit cells , and standard approaches to linear and non - linear polarizabilities apply : the formal problem of calculating the crystal polarization and the relevant ( hyper)polarizability is trivially solved in this limit .",
    "the actual calculation of the electrical responses of molecular crystals is difficult , however , particularly for crystals of highly polarizable molecules . in these materials in fact important collective effects are expected@xcite and , even if the dipole moment can be calculated as the sum of local dipole moments , the polarizability and the hyperpolarizabilities are not the sum of local contributions .    in this paper",
    "we address the calculation of the linear polarizability @xmath3 in crystalline materials , as related to the experimentally accessible static dielectric constant .",
    "sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the analysis of organic molecular crystals with little or no intermolecular overlap . in these insulators",
    "the zero - overlap approximation for charge densities allows to adopt standard expressions for the polarizability tensor , whose cartesian components @xmath8 measure the curvature of the gs energy @xmath9 with respect to the field : @xmath10 the sum - over - state ( sos ) expression is the second order correction .",
    "it involves the excited states @xmath11 at energy @xmath12 above the gs at @xmath13 and the dipole operator @xmath14 .",
    "the first expression for @xmath3 above is the finite - field ( ff ) result , that requires only the gs , albeit at finite fields .",
    "we emphasize the long - range nature of electrostatic interactions that lead to significant perturbations to @xmath3 as due to the environment even in the absence of direct intermolecular overlap .",
    "section 2 reviews a recent approach to the detailed calculation of @xmath3 in non - polar chromophores with an extended and strongly polarizable @xmath0-system .",
    "this approach , based on the ff calculation of @xmath3 for molecules experiencing the electric field generated by the surrounding molecules , relies on quantum chemical models for the isolated molecular fragments and leads to quantitative estimates of the dielectric constant for crystals and films that nicely compare with experimental data .",
    "section 3 presents an instructive toy model for clusters of polar and polarizable chromophores , based on a two - state picture for each chromophore .",
    "whereas this simple model is hardly quantitative , it correctly grasps the basic physics of supramolecular interactions in these materials .",
    "very schematically , fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] depicts a polar chromophore in an environment of polar molecules that can be either an ordered crystal or a solution .",
    "electrostatic interactions among dipoles and induced dipoles require a self - consistent treatment that accounts for large local fields due to the dipoles and induced dipoles themselves .",
    "huge collective effects are possible in systems of polar - polarizable molecules , and are indeed expected for certain ranges of parameters .",
    "we note that the dipoles in fig .",
    "1 may represent both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom or more complicated charge distributions .",
    "quite generally , the zero - overlap approximation for molecular aggregates or crystals leads to such electrostatic problems .",
    "models with a limited number of states are then particularly instructive for assessing the inevitable approximations in molecular or extended systems .",
    "the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) separation of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is ubiquitous for molecules and generates potential energy surfaces ( pes ) . in section 4",
    "we will assess the bo approximation for @xmath3 in models whose exact eigenstates are accessible , and will present a very simple expression for the vibrational contributions to @xmath3 that applies in the limit of low vibrational frequencies .    based on these results , in section 5",
    "we briefly address the role of vibrational degrees of freedom in charge - transfer ( ct ) salts with a mixed ( donor acceptor , da ) stack motif and variable ionicity .",
    "a first description of these materials was given in terms of non - overlapping da pairs,@xcite so that collective effects in @xmath3 are easily predicted .",
    "however , any realistic model for ct salts must account for charge delocalization along the stack .",
    "since the clausius - mossotti approximation no longer applies , we resort to berry - phase polarization and consider @xmath7 at instabilities .",
    "we relate the peak in the dielectric constant observed in some ct salts at a peierls instability to large charge - fluxes induced along the stack by lattice vibrations .",
    "the polarization energy of a charge @xmath15 in a cavity of radius @xmath16 in medium with dielectric constant @xmath17 is @xmath18 , or @xmath19 1 ev for typical @xmath20     and @xmath21 in organic molecular crystals.@xcite the major role of polarization has long been appreciated in organic semiconductors.@xcite the transport gap @xmath22 for creating an electron - hole pair at infinite separation is reduced from the gas phase value by @xmath23 , the separate stabilization of the cation and anion .",
    "the major ( @xmath2490% ) part of @xmath7 is thought to be electronic,@xcite with lattice relaxation or polarons accounting for the rest , and our discussion of @xmath7 in this section is restricted to electronic polarization .",
    "we ask how the charge density @xmath25 in the solid differs from the gas - phase density @xmath26 of molecules at the same nuclear positions .",
    "the crystal induces the difference , @xmath27 .",
    "the lowest - order correction can again be viewed as polarization and rationalized by small overlaps in organic crystals .",
    "organic molecular solids typically have van der waals contacts and slightly shifted electronic or vibrational excitations , as suggested by the oriented gas model that is the starting point of molecular exciton theory .",
    "first - order corrections to energies clearly depend only on @xmath26 , which can be inferred from gas - phase experiment or theory .",
    "electronic polarization is the first - order correction to @xmath26 , or to the wavefunction , and is accordingly more difficult to compute .",
    "small overlap at van der waals separations suggests starting with zero intermolecular overlap and introducing finite band widths later . in the zero - overlap approximation ,",
    "charge redistribution @xmath28 is clearly confined to molecules and intermolecular interactions are purely electrostatic.@xcite in this sense , the specific model of polar - polarizable molecules introduced in the next section represents any aggregate .",
    "conceptually , we have a crystal of quantum mechanical molecules with classical interactions that may be viewed as a non - uniform electric field @xmath29 .",
    "since induced dipoles contribute to @xmath29 , a self - consistent solution is required and made practical by translational symmetry .",
    "for example , consider a crystal in a uniform @xmath30 .",
    "since all unit cells have the same total field , we apply constant @xmath1 and resolve @xmath1 into local and external fields at the end.@xcite the calculation of @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the polarization energy of an isolated charge , is done in two steps.@xcite first , the _ extensive _ quantity @xmath33 is found for the neutral lattice using translational invariance .",
    "then the _ intensive _ quantity @xmath34 is found relative to @xmath35 in spheres of radius @xmath11 about the charge without redistributing charge on molecules whose center is outside the sphere .",
    "convergence to @xmath36 rigorously goes as @xmath37 at large @xmath11 with a slope that depends on the dielectric tensor @xmath17 .",
    "representative organic crystals show proper convergence by @xmath38  .",
    "this corresponds to clusters of thousands of molecules and underscores the long - range nature of polarization .",
    "the polarization energy of ct states also requires two steps , again starting with @xmath35 .",
    "the sphere @xmath11 now encloses a cation and anion at fixed separation in the crystal lattice .",
    "the polarization energy converges faster , as @xmath39 , since a dipole is enclosed .",
    "the zero - overlap approximation reduces electronic polarization to finding @xmath3 for molecules in a non - uniform field @xmath29 . this major simplification yields a continuum problem for the functional derivative , @xmath40 , of the gs charge density at @xmath41 with respect to the potential at @xmath42 . to be practical for crystals or thin films of large molecules ,",
    "we introduce a discrete approximation for @xmath43 by restricting @xmath41 and @xmath42 at molecule @xmath44 to the atomic positions @xmath45 and evaluating @xmath46 and @xmath47 at @xmath45 .",
    "as done routinely in electrostatic ( madelung ) calculations,@xcite we represent the gas phase @xmath26 by atomic charges @xmath48 at @xmath45 . electronic polarization then yields new atomic charges and induced atomic dipoles that are given by the following linear equations,@xcite    @xmath49    here the sum is over atoms @xmath50 of molecule @xmath16 , the electrostatic potential is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the atom - atom polarizability tensor , @xmath53 that governs how charge redistributes within a molecule .",
    "the dipoles @xmath54 contribute to the potential and change according to @xmath55 .",
    "the approximations of zero - overlap and discrete atomic moments lead to eight linear equations per atom , namely the scalars @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the vectors @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "they are solved iteratively starting with the oriented - gas potential @xmath60 produced by @xmath61 .",
    "clusters of thousands of molecules with about 50 atoms each are accessible on workstations .",
    "@xcite    we comment on general aspects of charge redistribution without going into computational details that are found in refs . and .",
    "first , semiempirical theory such as indo / s @xcite is particularly convenient for @xmath62 since @xmath57 is then simply a site energy ; this approximation , typical in solid - state models , is neither the finite - field nor the sos method of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , but can be compared to them in exact models .",
    "second , the best gas - phase polarizability @xmath3 from experiment or theory is retained and partitioned between charge redistribution and a remainder , the @xmath63 above .",
    "an intuitive partitioning of @xmath3 in acenes , as done in the submolecular method @xcite , leads to self - consistent equations for induced dipoles in external fields .",
    "similarly , the gs dipole @xmath14 of polar molecules can be partitioned between charge redistribution and the @xmath64 above . in the spirit of molecular exciton theory , we focus on how @xmath28 changes in the actual crystal lattice for molecules whose electronic structure is given by hypothesis .",
    "third , polarization energies are bilinear expressions @xcite in self - consistent atomic charges and induced dipoles coupled to gas - phase potentials or , vice versa , self - consistent potentials and fields coupled to gas - phase charges or dipoles . since potentials and fields produced by the best gas - phase charge distribution @xmath26 can be evaluated at atomic positions of the crystal lattice , first - order corrections to polarization energies based on discrete @xmath61 can readily be found .",
    "@xcite such corrections are important in acenes or other systems with electron - hole symmetry and hence @xmath65 in the neutral molecule .    the optical dielectric tensor , or indices of refraction , of anthracene crystals has been measured @xcite separately and taken together yield the principal values @xmath66 and uncertainties in table 1 .",
    "the principal axes are the crystallographic @xmath67 axis , by symmetry , and @xmath68 is the angle between @xmath69 and @xmath16 in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "all calculations are based on the same , indo / s - based @xmath62 , but have different molecular @xmath3 inputs as indicated in the table , including the experimental polarizability . the triple - zeta basis with field - induced polarization functions from ref . and density functional theory ( b3lyp ) with a large basis are nearly quantitative , while the oriented - gas value based on @xmath26 is clearly not .",
    "the dielectric tensor of the crystal includes charge redistribution and induced dipoles whose interactions are treated self - consistently via eqs ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "polarization energies @xmath71 or @xmath32 are surface rather than bulk measurements.@xcite as sketched in fig .",

    "thin organic films on metallic substrates are used .",
    "recent interest in organic electronic devices is made possible by advances in forming and characterizing crystalline thin films that compensate for the limited mobility of charges .",

    "convergence again requires thousands of molecules and can be monitored with respect to @xmath72 as well as pill - box radius .",
    "perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ptcda ) is a good hole conductor and excellent film former , with molecules lying almost flat on the surface.@xcite it is a prototypical molecule for organic devices .",
    "the crystal value for @xmath23 is 1.82 ev , which is in the expected range.@xcite the calculated monolayer value is @xmath74= 1.93 ev.@xcite the large polarizability of image charges on one side offsets the vacuum on the other side .",
    "accordingly , thick films have reduced @xmath75 = 1.41 ev .",

    "the separate values of @xmath31 or @xmath32 are relevant for matching energy levels to facilitate the injection of holes or electrons .",
    "efficient injection is a major challenge whose pursuit is largely empirical at present , usually without any consideration of polarization .",
    "pentacene is another widely used molecule , mainly as thin film transistors.@xcite its herringbone structure is more common than ptcda stacks .",
    "pentacene films have the long axis almost normal to the surface , with high conductivity parallel to the surface .",

    "@xmath77 differs by only 6 mev from the crystal , while @xmath75 is 0.23 ev less and @xmath76 is 0.13 ev greater.@xcite the contrasting structures of pentacene and ptcda films lead to different electronic polarizabilities that can now be estimated in the well - defined limit of zero overlap rather than just expected on general grounds in anisotropic solids .",
    "similarly , accurate polarization energies are needed for quantitative analyses of transport gaps or of ct states seen in electroabsorption .    in the context of polarizabilities",
    ", we close this section by noting that since the pentacene long axis is almost normal to the metal , the images charges for a cation or anion produce fields along the direction of largest @xmath3 and redistribute charge to the ends of the molecule .",
    "the induced dipoles of adjacent molecules are parallel and close to each other .",
    "these repulsive interactions are relieved by redistributing charge toward the molecule s center , as actually found in the self - consistent solution.@xcite the field @xmath78 at a pentacene ion on a metallic surface vanishes for atoms near the center and ranges from @xmath7910@xmath80 v / cm for atoms close to and far from the metal .",
    "electronic polarization in organic molecular crystals produces highly non - uniform fields , as found explicitly in pentacene films and studied below in clusters of polar - polarizable molecules .",
    "important intermolecular effects are expected in materials where several polar and highly polarizable molecules interact . in these materials in fact the local fields generated by the polar molecules strongly affect the charge distribution on the molecules themselves , leading to a non - trivial self - consistent problem . in so - called push - pull chromophores an electron - donor ( d ) and an electron - acceptor ( a ) group are linked by a @xmath0-conjugated bridge .",
    "these intrinsically polar molecules are also highly polarizable due to the presence of delocalized @xmath0-electrons .",

    "hence differences between the continuous lines and the dot - dashed line measure the vibrational contribution to the static response.@xcite    for actual molecules or complexes , the large number of electronic states makes non - adiabatic calculations very demanding , and the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation is usually invoked . in the bo approximation ,",

    "when applied within a ff approach to susceptibilities , the bo approximation immediately leads to a partitioning of the susceptibility into pe and ke contributions.@xcite within bo , the lowest eigenstate of the electronic hamiltonian defines the pe for the motion of nuclei ( in the gs manifold , of course ) .",
    "the total gs energy is obtained by adding the nuclear ke to the pe .",
    "then , as long as bo applies , susceptibilities , i.e. the successive derivatives of the gs energy with respect to an applied electric field , can be calculated as sums of pe and ke @xmath1-derivatives .",
    "the nuclear ke vanishes in the @xmath154 limit , and the ( @xmath140-independent ) pe polarizability , reported as the dashed line in fig .",

    "the electronic polarization of the holstein da molecule is analytical @xcite and is reported as the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ alpha_omega ] .",
    "we can now understand the evolution of the vibrational contribution to the polarizability with the vibrational frequency : in the low-@xmath140 limit , ke contributions vanish , and the exact curve tends to the limiting pe result .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is trivial .",
    "more generally it is easily implemented in quantum chemistry calculations and in solid - state models as well , since it only requires the gs energy calculated at the relaxed geometry for different values of an externally applied field .",
    "the calculation of ke contribution is more difficult , since the @xmath1-dependence of the lowest vibrational state in the anharmonic gs pes is needed .",
    "the nuclear ke contributes to susceptibilities in two different ways.@xcite first of all , due to anharmonicity , the molecular geometry in the vibronic gs is different from the equilibrium geometry ( corresponding to the minimum of the gs pes ) .",
    "this correction is however very small .",
    "the second contribution stems from the @xmath1-dependence of the nuclear ke itself : it is this contribution that indeed accounts for the deviations of the exact curves from the ( dashed ) pe curve ( at least in the bo regime , @xmath156 , where non - adiabatic corrections are negligible ) .",
    "ke contributions are of course very small for low @xmath140 , but they increase with increasing @xmath140 , leading to a suppression of the vibrational amplification of the static polarizability .",
    "this is by no means accidental : in the antiadiabatic limit ( @xmath157 ) phonons can not contribute to the static polarizability and , with increasing @xmath140 , ke contributions progressively increase to counterbalance the pe contribution .",
    "ke contributions to the linear polarizability exactly vanish in the harmonic approximation.@xcite in fact , the equilibrium position in any harmonic vibrational state coincides with the bottom of the pes ; moreover the nuclear ke is proportional to the harmonic frequency , i.e. to the curvature of the pes . for a parabolic pes ,",
    "this quantity is obviously independent of @xmath136 , and hence of @xmath1 .",
    "then , in the low @xmath140 limit , where ke contributions to susceptibilities are negligible , the exact @xmath3 ( continuous line in fig . [ alpha_omega ] ) coincides with the corresponding best - harmonic estimate , i.e. with the estimate obtained by modeling the gs pes as the parabola with the exact curvature at the equilibrium .",
    "this is not true for hyper - polarizabilities that , in the same @xmath158 limit , are strongly amplified by the anharmonicity of the gs pes.@xcite within the best harmonic approximation,@xcite @xmath3 is conveniently partitioned into an electronic and vibrational contribution : @xmath159 \\label{aelavib}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the infrared transition dipole moment and @xmath161 is the frequency of the best harmonic frequency , i.e. the curvature of the gs pes at equilibrium .",
    "the vibrational contribution to the linear polarizability is then proportional to the infrared intensity of the coupled mode , at least in the low - frequency regime , where pe contributions dominate the response .",
    "we underline that this result only relies on the bo approximation and on the neglect of ke contributions to the polarizability .",
    "it therefore applies in the low-@xmath140 limit quite irrespective of the detailed model for the electron - phonon coupling , and also for largely anharmonic pes .",
    "charge - transfer ( ct ) crystals have mixed face - to - face stacks of planar @xmath0-electron donors and acceptors as sketched in fig . [ stack ] .",
    "intermolecular overlap is negligible between stacks , but not within stacks where @xmath162 overlap is indicated by less than van der waals separation between d and a. the gs consequently has fractional charges @xmath86 at d and -@xmath86 at a sites . @xcite just as an example , in the prototypical material , ttf - ca , at ambient conditions about 0.2 electrons are transferred on average from the donor ( tetrathiafulvalene , ttf ) to the acceptor ( chloranil , ca).@xcite as seen in fig .",
    "[ stack ] , a regular stack of centrosymmetric molecules is not polar because there is an inversion center at each site , as in fact occurs in the actual structures .",
    "the inversion center is lost on dimerization and the gs becomes ferroelectric if dimerization is in the same sense everywhere .",

    "they are a complex and interesting phenomenon:@xcite both continuous and discontinuous transitions are known and , in all cases , stack dimerization accompanies the charge crossover proving the important role of phonons and of e - ph coupling in these systems .",
    "a sharp peak in the dielectric constant has been observed at the n - i transition of several ct crystals,@xcite .",
    "it can be understood on general grounds as due to large charge fluxes induced by an applied field near the charge crossover , but microscopic modeling of dielectric peaks is still in progress.@xcite charges are delocalized along the stack and the zero - overlap approximation does not apply : we need a model for polarization in extended and highly correlated systems .",
    "moreover the lattice ( peierls ) phonon that induces dimerization is strongly coupled to electronic degrees of freedom in a manner reminiscent of solitons in polyacetylene .",
    "@xcite the peierls mode in fact induces large charge displacements around the n - i crossover , and vibrational contributions to the polarizability can not be disregarded .",
    "the electronic structure of mixed stack ct salts can be described in terms of a hubbard model with only on - site electron - electron repulsion ( @xmath164 ) explicitly accounted for , and modified to account for the alternation of on - site energies , @xmath165.@xcite this model accounts only implicitly for madelung interactions and hence describes only continuous n - i transitions .",
    "we also account for the coupling to the peierls phonon , described by @xmath166 , as follows : @xcite    @xmath167(c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i+1,\\sigma } + h.c . )",

    "the last term in the above hamiltonian measures the bare elastic energy associated with the dimerization mode , with @xmath171 measuring the lattice stiffness .",
    "the rigid lattice has @xmath172 = 0 .",
    "for @xmath173 the hamiltonian ( 9 ) describes an almost n lattice ( @xmath174 ) of donors and acceptors , whereas for @xmath175 an almost i lattice of spin 1/2 radical ions is obtained ( @xmath176).@xcite the two phases are qualitatively different , with the i lattice being unconditionally unstable to dimerization ( spin - peierls transitions , @xcite ) .",
    "the n - i crossover can consequently be identified precisely even for continuous @xmath86 in the rigid regular stack.@xcite conditional instability in the n regime implies that soft lattices dimerize on that side before reaching the n - i crossover.@xcite the peierls phonon induces large charge fluxes along the chain with effects that increase the nearer the dimerization transition is to the n - i crossover of the rigid lattice .    by exploiting the recent definition of polarization in extended systems @xcite , we were able to demonstrate huge peaks in the ir intensity of the peierls mode at the structural instability.@xcite but , as shown in the previous section for holstein modes , the ir intensity of vibrational modes is quite naturally related to the system s polarizability .",
    "we draw two inferences : first , peaks in the static dielectric constant near the neutral - ionic phase transition have a large contribution from vibrational degrees of freedom ; second such peaks in soft lattices are associated with the peierls transition and occur at @xmath177 1/2 .",
    "we anticipate that the hamiltonian ( 9 ) or a closely related model will describe dielectric peaks",
    ".    since lattice phonons have low frequencies ( @xmath178 100 @xmath179 0.2 ev ) , the bo approximation applies and the ke contribution to @xmath3 can be safely neglected .",
    "the calculation of the vibrational contribution to @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ aelavib ] ) is simple , given the ir intensity of the relevant model .",
    "but the electronic contribution to @xmath3 is difficult for correlated electrons and will be presented separately.@xcite    as a first estimate of the relative importance of the electronic and vibrational contributions , we consider the @xmath180 limit of uncorrelated electrons in ( 9 ) , whose electronic @xmath3 has long been known .",
    "@xcite @xmath180 results are reported in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] for @xmath181 , which is a fairly stiff lattice that approximates ttf - ca .",
    "the static dielectric constant is related to polarizability by the standard expression : @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the permittivity of vacuum and @xmath3 is the polarizability per unit cell .",
    "we took ttf - ca lattice parameters as typical for ct crystals .",
    "moreover , for the sake of simplicity , we neglected the softening of the peierls mode at the transition , by simply substituting the @xmath161 entering the expression for the vibrational polarizability in eq .",
    "( [ aelavib ] ) with the reference frequency ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "thus the estimated vibrational contribution to @xmath17 is a lower limit .",
    "the magnitude of electronic and vibrational contributions to @xmath17 is similar for noninteracting electrons .",
    "yet the peak at the peierls instability in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] clearly has a vibrational origin .",
    "the physical basis of this behavior lies in the large charge fluctuations generated by peierls phonons in the vicinity of a charge instability , and underlines once more the importance of properly accounting for e - ph coupling in systems with delocalized electrons .",
    "all material properties , including _ electronic _ responses are in fact non - trivially affected by coupling to nuclear motions . the electronic contribution , by contrast ,",
    "is dominated in @xmath180 systems by the gap between the valence and conduction band of ( 9 ) .",
    "this gap is almost constant @xcite at equilibrium in the dimerized lattice , with increasing @xmath166 offsetting decreasing @xmath165 in fig .",

    "ct salts are correlated systems with large @xmath164 in ( 9 ) .",
    "although their dielectric constants are not expected to resemble @xmath180 results , the peierls instability on the n side nevertheless ensures a strong vibrational peak where @xmath185 is monotonic . and",
    "increasing dimerization still produces a gap in the electronic excitations @xmath186 in ( 1 ) that reduces @xmath185 at the n - i interface .",
    "some key @xmath180 features are expected to be retained in ct salts .",
    "modeling the dielectric behavior of molecular materials made up of strongly polarizable molecules is challenging in several respects . even in traditional molecular crystals where the overlap of charge densities on different molecules can be safely neglected ,",
    "the self - consistent interplay between local electric field and molecular polarizabilities ( and hyperpolarizabilities ) is responsible for the appearance of large collective effects : the response of the material is quantitatively , and possibly even qualitatively different from the behavior of a collection of non - interacting molecules . in section 2 a recent approach to the calculation of the dielectric constant of molecular crystals and films made up of large @xmath0-conjugated and non - polar molecules",
    "is summarized .",
    "the approach is based on the mf approximation , so that the problem for @xmath72 interacting molecules reduces to the self - consistent problem of a single molecule experiencing the local electric field generated by the surrounding molecules .",

    "few - state models , while less accurate than quantum - chemical descriptions , yield a more transparent description of the basic physics of the system , and , being amenable to exact solution , offer valuable information on the validity of approximations necessarily introduced when handling more complex hamiltonians . results in section 3",
    "confirm the reliability of mf approximation as introduced in section 2 for linear ( and non - linear ) electric susceptibilities of molecular materials with non - overlapping charge distributions .",
    "exact results for the toy - model also confirm the importance of collective effects in aggregates of polar - polarizable chromophores , in which supramolecular interactions can tune molecular polarity over a wide range .",
    "few state models are also useful to address vibrational contributions to polarizabilities , and particularly to assess the reliability of standard approximation schemes including the bo separation of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom and the harmonic approximation . a reduced on - site basis , and hence models with few local states , are also a useful starting point to face the challenging problem of polarizability in covalent insulators , such as ct salts .",
    "electronic ( charge ) instabilities and lattice instabilities coexist in these materials and compete and/or cooperate in complex and interesting ways .",
    "the peak in the dielectric constant of several ct salts is due to the peierls mode and provides another example of intimate coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom .",
