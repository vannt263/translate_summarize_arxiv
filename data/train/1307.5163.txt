    "the goal of this article is to prove the dynamic programming principle ( dpp in the sequel ) for a class of stochastic control problems in a continuous - time markov - like environment , including two fundamental problems in financial mathematics defined over or parametrized by a set of `` martingale '' measures . to this end",
    ", we introduce a flexible abstract framework in which , we hope , other problems can be treated as well .    the history of the dpp is fascinating ; it starts with the work of wald @xcite and bellman @xcite , although the idea of the reduction of a complicated sequential problem to a family of simpler ones is undoubtedly much older . a rigorous discrete - time theory focusing on intricate measurability issues started with the work of blackwell and others ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; we refer the reader to @xcite for further bibliographical information and a detailed discussion ) .",
    "it was already known to these authors that - unlike in the setting of deterministic optimal control , where the validity of the dpp is easier to establish - the stochastic version of the dpp comes with a number of additional subtleties and requires a much more delicate treatment .",
    "for this reason , two main schools of thought dominate the control - theoretic literature . in one of them ,",
    "great importance is given to a rigorous derivation of an appropriate version of the dpp .",
    "the other , however , treats the very need for a proof of the dpp as a mathematical pedantry and sees it as an evidently correct general principle .    in order to provide a suitable general theoretical foundation _ in continuous time _ , and , in the endgame , a practical convergence of the two approaches , a flurry of activity over the last decades expanded tremendously our understanding of continuous - time dpp in a variety of settings ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "independently of the present paper , and with a different point of view , the authors of @xcite and @xcite also provide an abstract approach to the dynamic programming and give a thorough treatment of descriptive set - theoretic machinery which underlies it .",
    "moreover , a similar descriptive - set - theoretic idea have recently been used successfully in the context of model uncertainty and nonlinear expectations ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , with the setting and technique , especially in @xcite , similar to that of parts of sections 2.1 and 3.2 of the present paper .    a different point of view , called the `` stochastic perron method '' , initiated by bayraktar and sirbu ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) circumvents the use of the formal dpp altogether and derives verification results for the corresponding hjb equations directly under natural condition on the equation itself .      while quite general and extremely useful in their own domains , none of the existing results seem to apply to the general markovian versions of the problems of lower hedging or utility maximization , often seen as fundamental in the field of financial mathematics .",
    "these problems are naturally defined over sets of equivalent local - martingale measures and , depending on the particular setting , do not admit a naive translation into the classical control milieu .",
    "indeed , they usually come in the `` weakly - constrained '' form : when framed in the classical stochastic - control language , the set of admissible controls is unconstrained locally , but still required to consist of processes which , when acted upon by a stochastic - exponential type operator , yield uniformly - integrable ( as opposed to merely local ) martingales . this difficulty vanishes when one chooses to view these problems in their ( we dare say , even more natural ) weak formulation , and works with sets of probability measures rather than control processes right from the start .",
    "the weak approach is certainly not new in stochastic control theory ; the first uses of a `` controlled martingale problem '' go back at least to @xcite .",
    "many other authors ( see @xcite and @xcite and the references therein ) use similar concepts under different names , such as the `` weak formulation '' .    an added technical benefit of the weak approach is the complete avoidance of subtle measure - theoretic difficulties ( mostly dealing with the stochastic integration ) inherent to the dpp - based treatment of strongly formulated problems . in fact",
    ", it could be argued that the entire `` philosophy '' of our approach is based on this fact : the descriptive - set - theoretic and topological framework of classical discrete - time optimal control and the analytical and process - theoretic framework of the contemporary stochastics do not seem to play well together .",
    "for example , the filtration completion makes a tractable stochastic - integration theory possible , while simultaneously destroying the countable - generation property .    the strong formulation - where the controls and the noise inhabit a fixed filtered probability space - may seem to be more amenable to concatenation ( the basic construction in any dpp treatment ) .",
    "the message we are sending here is that , from the analytical point of view , measures are easier to work with , and just as easy to concatenate .",
    "this perspective aligns well with the mental model often present in the classical gambling theory ( see @xcite ) , wherein the player ( controller ) chooses a  gambling house  ,",
    "i.e. , one among possibly many available probability measures to govern the future evolution of the state process . clearly , the difference lies mostly in interpretation , but , as we hope our results demonstrate , it can be an important one .      to implement the conceptual framework described above",
    ", we introduce a structure , called the * controlled markov family * , reminiscent of , and modeled on , a classical markov family associated to a markov process .",
    "it consists of a family of sets of probability measures , one for each point of the state space @xmath0 , with the interpretation that the probability measures available at @xmath1 can be used by the controller in order to steer the system so as to minimize the expected value of the given cost functional .",
    "these probability measures are defined on the set @xmath2 of rcll trajectories and do not necessarily form a markov family , or correspond to a markov process on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , our main theorem can be understood as a description of how close to `` being markov '' our families of sets of probability measures ( one for each @xmath1 ) must be in order for the dpp to hold . put yet differently , we are interested in a useful generalization of chapman - kolmogorov equations to the set - valued case .",
    "it turns out that two natural requirements , namely * concatenability * ( closure under concatenation ) and * analyticity * , lead to a convenient definition .",
    "the first makes sure that the controller can change his / her mind midstream and switch to any measure available at the current state .",
    "the second condition is of purely technical nature , and imposes a minimal degree of regularity on how the family of available probability laws changes from point to point .",
    "to understand it better , let us mention that analyticity directly implies that the value function is upper semi - analytic , which , in turn , makes it universally measurable .",
    "as observed in @xcite , universal measurability ( i.e. , measurability with respect to a completion of the borel @xmath3-algebra under any borel probability measure ) is about the weakest property one can require from the value function for even the formulation of the dpp to make sense . indeed , the right - hand side of a typical dpp statement will involve the expectation ( an integral ) of the value function applied to a random variable , which , without a minimal degree of measurability , can not even be defined without running into serious conceptual difficulties .",
    "while the value functions associated with controlled markov processes already possess many good properties and satisfy `` half '' of the dpp , another condition - in a sense dual to concatenability - is needed for the full dpp to hold . named * ( approximate ) disintegrability * , it postulates that , if required to switch to an admissible control , the controller can oblige at any point in time and still remain ( nearly ) optimal .",
    "our main abstract result states that a controlled markov family with the additional property of disintegrability defines a value function for which the full dpp holds and extends the classical descriptive - set - theoretic approach of discrete - time stochastic optimal control to continuous time with markovian - like dynamics .",
    "as we explain it in more detail in subsection [ sub : fex ] , part ( 1 ) , that canonical feller families ( and virtually all other markov families under minimal regularity conditions ) , when understood as controlled markov families with singleton control sets , automatically satisfy the three key properties of analyticity , concatenability and disintegrability .",
    "it is important to make it clear that our main abstract result - theorem [ thm : main ] - together with the techniques used in its proof , is quite similar to some of the related results found throughout the literature ( some of them going back to blackwell ) . on the other hand ,",
    "its scope and the level of abstraction are new and seem to be unavailable ; its value lies primarily in its applicability in specific situations , as explained below .      after the main abstract theorem and a practical sufficient condition for its assumptions to hold , the paper treats several examples in various degrees of detail .",
    "we start by showing that many ( uncontrolled ) markov families - such as the canonical rcll markov families - naturally satisfy the conditions of concatenability , disintegrability and analyticity , in a rather trivial way . we comment , though , that the families obtained by solving martingale problems with multiple solutions furnish a less trivial example : the family of sets of all weak solutions of a martingale problem will form a controlled markov family under the right regularity conditions , too .",
    "next , we turn to a birds - eye discussion of how one can interpret control problems in the classical strong formulation as controlled markov families , and what structure is needed for our abstract theorem to apply .",
    "the technical bulk of the paper is devoted to a detailed treatment of the lower - hedging and the utility - maximization problems of financial mathematics .",
    "it is in these - but certainly not exclusively in these - moderately nonstandard control problems where the power of our approach seems to be evident .",
    "the first example we focus on deals with the problem of lower hedging ( sub - replication ) in rather general financial markets .",
    "we showcase the power of our framework by establishing a dpp for this problem when the stock prices , along with non - traded factor processes , form a rcll feller process with a hausdorff lccb state space .",
    "additional conditions imposed on the model are minimal : the classical no - arbitrage ( nflvr ) assumption and the weak requirement of local boundedness from below ( which is , e.g. , implied by continuity or nonnegativity of the stock price ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the collections of equivalent local - martingale measures - parametrized by the initial condition - form a controlled markov family and , additionally , satisfy the condition of disintegrability .",
    "the results obtained for lower hedging are further developed to show that the dpp holds for the utility - maximization problem with a random endowment under the same , minimal , regularity assumptions .",
    "the way this problem is tackled sheds additional light on how our framework may be used : unlike in the lower hedging problem , the set of equivalent local martingale measures itself _ does not _ play the role of the controlled markov family , but it _ parametrizes it _ in a borel - measurable way . thanks to good stability properties of analytic sets ,",
    "this is enough to guarantee the assumptions of the abstract theorem and , consequently , imply the dpp for this problem , too .      after this introduction , section 2 outlines the abstract setup and presents our main abstract theorem together with its proof .",
    "first examples and a necessary condition for the assumptions of the theory to hold are also given .",
    "section 3 applies the abstract results to the problems of lower hedging and utility maximization in financial mathematics .",
    "a short appendix contains a telegraphic primer ( in place primarily to fix the terminology ) on the pertinent concepts and results of basic descriptive set theory .",
    "[ sec : model ] we start by describing a fairly general probabilistic setting for the weak formulation of optimal stochastic control . the reader will observe that - in its essence , at least - it is a marriage between the classical discrete - time framework as described , for example , in @xcite , and the standard set - up for markov families on the canonical space of right - continuous paths with left limits , as outlined , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "in fact , an effort has been made to stress the formal analogy with the abstract structure of a markov family as much as possible .",
    "we remind the reader that a short glossary of necessary descriptive - set - theoretic terms ( used below ) is given in the appendix .      for completeness and definiteness , we start by defining some standard elements of the setup .

    "we focus on the dual formulation of the utility - maximization problem in this paper not only because it fits our framework , but also because it is often much easier to work with in practice . for the reader interested in the primal problem , here are a few words about its relationship with the dual problem and the dpp .",
    "the classical utility - maximization theorem with random endowment in as described in @xcite and adadpted to fit our notation comes with the function @xmath549 of the form @xmath556 where @xmath557 is a bounded borel function and @xmath558 is the dual of a utility function @xmath559 , i.e. , an increasing and strictly concave @xmath560-map @xmath561 , with @xmath562 and @xmath563 .",

    "the infimum in is taken over a countable set , so the conclusion of universal measurability transfers directly from @xmath112 to @xmath567 .",
    "the same relationship can be used to show that the function @xmath567 satisfies the appropriate version of the dpp .",
    "for technical reasons , some basic concepts from descriptive set theory are needed .",
    "the following few paragraphs provide a ( necessarily inadequate ) review of the most prominent notions and facts ; we refer the reader to chapter 7 of @xcite , or the textbooks @xcite and @xcite , for a thorough treatment .",
    "a * polish * space is a separable topological space whose topology can be induced by a complete metric .",
    "the main examples include all countable discrete spaces , as well as euclidean spaces @xmath236 , @xmath571 , in addition to a host of `` infinite - dimensional '' spaces such as the hilbert space @xmath407^{{{\\mathbb n}}}$ ] , the baire space @xmath572 , or any separable banach space , all with the usual topologies .",
    "compact metric spaces as well as locally - compact hausdorff spaces with a countable base ( lccb ) are polish ; so are countable products ( with the product topology ) of polish spaces and all their @xmath573 ( and , in particular , open or closed ) subsets .    a subset @xmath214 of a polish space @xmath231",
    "is called * analytic * if it can be realized as a projection of a borel subset of @xmath574 onto @xmath231 .",
    "borel subsets of polish spaces are analytic , but , unless the space is countable , one can always find non - borel analytic sets .",
    "the family of all analytic sets is closed under countable unions and intersections , as well as direct and inverse images of borel maps .",
    "it is , generally , not closed under complementation .",
    "in fact , a complement of an analytic set , known as a co - analytic set , is itself analytic if and only if it is borel measurable .    the * universal @xmath3-algebra @xmath575 * is the intersection of the @xmath33-completions of the borel @xmath3-algebra on @xmath231 , over the family of all probability measures @xmath33 on it .",
    "its importance for us stems from the fact that @xmath575-measurable functions can be integrated with respect to any probability measure , thus allowing us to treat them as if they were borel measurable for most practical purposes .",
    "a * suslin scheme * on a set @xmath231 equipped with a family @xmath576 of ( not necessarily all of ) its subsets , is a map @xmath577 .",
    "the suslin operation assigns to every suslin scheme @xmath161 on @xmath576 the set @xmath578 .",
    "two important facts about suslin schemes in our context are the following : 1 ) @xmath214 is an analytic subset of a polish space @xmath231 if and only if it is the result of some suslin operation on the closed subsets of @xmath231 , and 2 ) the universal @xmath3-algebra is closed under the suslin operation .",
