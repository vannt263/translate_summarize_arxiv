    "this transition is generally accepted as a melting transition from a vortex solid to a vortex liquid .    a great deal of theoretical work @xcite has helped to establish that there is a first order melting transition .",
    "brzin , nelson and thiaville @xcite showed that including fluctuation effects in abrikosov s mean field theory of the flux lattice transition would drive the transition first order .",
    "the advent of the high temperature superconductors and the subsequent experimental indications of vortex lattice melting sparked intense theoretical activity .",

    "numerical simulations @xcite have been able to show that the melting is first order by calculating quantities such as the magnetization jump @xcite and the delta function in the specific heat @xcite . however these simulations were done in the limit of high magnetic fields @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the coherence length , @xmath10 is the spacing between vortices , and @xmath11 is the penetration depth .",
    "most @xcite assumed that the magnetic induction @xmath12 was spatially uniform and thus neglected the wavevector dependence of the elastic moduli .",
    "this has made quantitative comparison with experimental data difficult , especially in the case of bscco whose vortex lattice melts at low fields .",
    "in addition the mechanism for vortex lattice melting is still not well established .",
    "there have been suggestions that topological defects @xcite such as vortex loops @xcite , vortex  antivortex pairs @xcite , free disclinations @xcite , and dislocations @xcite may play a key role in triggering melting .      in this paper",
    "we show that melting can be induced by interstitial and vacancy line defects in the vortex lattice which soften the shear modulus @xmath13 .",
    "this softening makes it easier to introduce more defects and increases the vibrational free energy .",

    "the introduction of these defects softens the elastic moduli .",
    "since the energy to introduce interstitials and vacancies is proportional to the elastic moduli , softening makes it easier to introduce more defects .",
    "the softening also increases the vibrational entropy of the vortex lattice which leads to a melting transition .",
    "the transition is driven by the increased vibrational entropy of the vortex lines of the lattice , and not by the entropy of the wandering of the defect lines .",

    "( [ eq : shearmod ] ) , we can calculate the frequency dependence of the shear modulus @xmath198 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shearmod ] for a defect concentration of 5% .",
    "as expected the shear modulus has the shape of a step function ; it is zero at low frequencies and rises quite sharply to its infinite frequency value @xmath199 .",
    "notice that for bscco the crossover frequency is a few mhz and for ybco it is a few ghz . since 1",
    "k corresponds to 20 ghz , this means that we made an excellent approximation in setting @xmath218 in the free energy density @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeng ] ) .",
    "any theory that tries to describe melting has to contain two main ingredients : a satisfactory description of both the solid and the liquid phases and a mechanism by which the system goes from one to the other .",
    "the difficulty has always been to describe two phases with wildly different properties within the same framework . in the present work",
    ", we have achieve this by viewing the liquid as a solid with a finite concentration of vacancies and interstitial .",
    "clearly this is an approximation . if one wishes to describe a liquid as a solid with defects , other types of defects have to be taken into account as well .",
    "this is particularly true of dislocations .",
    "while we do not believe that thermally excited dislocations play the key role in mediating the melting transition because of their high energy cost , we believe that they will proliferate as soon as the vacancies and interstitials appear .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first interstitial vortex lines are usually attractive @xcite and can aggregate to form dislocations that extend the entire length of the lattice parallel to the c  axis .",
    "the same is true for vacancies .",
    "in particular , olive and brandt @xcite have done numerical simulations on line defects which were at least 5 lattice spacings apart .",
    "they found that both centered and edge interstitials @xcite are attractive if @xmath219 . for @xmath220 , edge interstitials were attractive for separations less that 10 lattice spacings and repulsive at larger distances while centered interstitials were repulsive at distances larger than 5 lattices spacings .",
    "vacancies were attractive in all cases .",
    "the second reason is that the substantial softening of the shear modulus brought about by the vacancies and interstitials reduces the dislocation core energy as well as the elastic energy of creating dislocations .",
    "for example , the core energy of a z  directed dislocation goes as @xmath221 and the core energy of a screw dislocation goes as @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the magnitude of the burger s vector @xcite . in addition the long  range interaction between dislocation loops is mediated by the strain field and depends on @xmath13 @xcite . once the dislocations have proliferated , the method and results of marchetti and radzihovsky @xcite can be used to provide a more detailed and accurate description of the liquid side of the transition .",
    "for example they show that when dislocations at all length scales are present , the shear modulus vanishes in the long wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "to summarize we have presented a model for the melting of a vortex lattice into a vortex liquid .",
    "the melting transition is induced by a few percent of vacancy and interstitial vortex lines that soften the shear modulus and increase the vibrational entropy .",
    "the increased vibrational entropy leads to melting .",
    "we obtain good agreement with the experimentally measured curve of transition temperature versus field , latent heat , and jumps in magnetization for bscco and ybco .",
    "the lindemann ratio @xmath165 is @xmath224% for bscco and @xmath225% for ybco .",
    "the hysteresis is small .",
    "we find a very small surface tension between the vortex solid and the vortex liquid along an interface parallel to the c  axis .",
    "the shear modulus is frequency dependent ; it is zero at @xmath226 and plateaus at higher frequencies to its infinite frequency value .",
    "we thank andy granato and lev bulaevskii for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by onr grant n00014 - 96 - 1 - 0905 and by funds provided by the university of california for the conduct of discretionary research by los alamos national laboratory .",
    "although calculations indicate that fluctuations in the density of vacancies and interstitial defects do not renormalize @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath13 does decrease as the average number of defects increases .                                            another way to estimate",
    "the free energy @xmath205 in ( [ eq : visc ] ) is to use the energy difference between a centered interstitial and an edge interstitial @xcite .",
    "a centered interstitial vortex line is at the center of a triangle whose vertices are the nearest neighbor lattice sites of a triangular lattice .",
    "an edge interstitial lies at the midpoint of one of the sides of the triangle .",
    "numerical calculations @xcite find this energy to be roughly @xmath235 k @xmath236 .",
    "so on the melting curve , @xmath237 .",
    "this estimate of @xmath205 is an order of magnitude smaller than the estimate we used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaf ] ) . as a result",
    "the the crossover frequency , where @xmath198 goes from its low frequency to its high frequency value , increases by less than a factor of two compared to the crossover frequencies shown in fig .",
