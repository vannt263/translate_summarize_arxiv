    "recent technological developments in electrochemical deposition have made possible experimental studies of atomic - scale dynamics @xcite .",

    "for an electrochemical adsorption system , the forc method consists of saturating the adsorbate coverage @xmath0 in a strong positive electrochemical potential @xmath1 ( proportional to the electrode potential , with the same sign for anions and opposite sign for cations ) and , in each case starting from saturation , decreasing @xmath1 at a constant scan rate @xmath2 to a series of progressively more negative `` reversal potentials '' @xmath3 .",

    "for consistency and convenience , a third - order polynomial was used with the three kinds of grids described above and at all points close to and away from the major loop .",
    "the three kinds of grids were compared for points away from the major hysteresis loop . while the larger @xmath14 grids ( ` square ' , and ` slanted ' ) produced very similar and smooth forc diagrams , the forc diagram produced by the @xmath13 grid was more noisy .",

    "another approach to calculating @xmath11 near the major loop would be to use an ` extended forc diagram ' @xcite , for which a square grid of points can be used even near the major loop , but where the delta function normalization term ( see footnote 1 ) will automatically be included by the polynomial fitting procedure described above .",

    "thus , forcs can be used to recover the equilibrium behavior for systems with continuous phase transitions that need a long time to equilibrate .",
    "this should be useful in experiments .",
    "second , due to the instability that exists in systems with a discontinuous phase transition , the minima of the family of forcs in this case form a back - bending `` van der waals loop , '' and the corresponding forc diagram contains negative regions that do not exist for systems with a continuous phase transition . since experimental implementation of the ec - forc method should only require simple reprogramming of a potentiostat designed to carry out a standard cv experiment , we believe the method can be of significant use in obtaining additional dynamic as well as equilibrium information from such experiments for systems that exhibit electrochemical adsorption with related phase transitions .",

    "<S> the method can not only differentiate between discontinuous and continuous phase transitions , but can also quite accurately recover equilibrium behavior from dynamic analysis of systems with a continuous phase transition . experimental data for ec - forc analysis could easily be obtained by simple reprogramming of a potentiostat designed for conventional cyclic - voltammetry experiments .    _ * keywords : * _ cyclic - voltammetry experiments ; first - order reversal curve ; hysteresis ; continuous phase transition ; discontinuous phase transition ; lattice - gas model ; kinetic monte carlo simulation . </S>"
