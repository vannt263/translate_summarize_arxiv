    "with the construction of 3-rd generation , hard x - ray synchrotron sources ( esrf , aps and spring8 ) with small source sizes and long distances from source to sample ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) , new experiments that exploit the high coherence properties of these x - ray beams have become feasible . new , high brilliance , low emittance , hard x - ray synchrotron sources , such as petra iii , are under construction @xcite and will provide an even higher coherent photon flux for users .",
    "experiments exploiting the coherence properties of these x - ray beams become even more important with the availability of 4-th generation x - ray sources - so - called x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfel ) ( fig . 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "these are presently in the comissioning phase in the usa @xcite and under construction in japan and europe @xcite ) . based on the self amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) process @xcite",
    ", they will provide ultrashort , coherent x - ray pulses of unprecedentedly high brightness .",
    "new areas of research have emerged that exploit the high coherence properties of x - ray beams including x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) ( for a review see @xcite ) and coherent x - ray diffractive imaging ( cxdi ) @xcite . in the former ,",
    "the dynamic properties of a system are studied and in the latter static features are analyzed and a real space image of the sample can be obtained by phase retrieval techniques @xcite .",
    "similar ideas can be realized through the use of newly emerging fel sources .",
    "these experiments can be further extended by the use of coherent femtosecond pulses of extremely high intensity .",
    "the first demonstration experiments of the possibility of single pulse @xcite and single pulse train @xcite coherent diffraction imaging were performed recently at the first fel for extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) wavelengths , the free - electron laser in hamburg ( flash ) @xcite . in the future , when x - ray fels with a unique femtosecond time structure will become available , this approach can even be used for different applications in materials science @xcite , the study of dynamics @xcite and biology including such exciting possibilities as single molecule imaging @xcite .        from these perspectives",
    "it is clear that understanding the coherence properties of beams emerging from 3-rd generation synchrotron sources and new fels is of vital importance for the scientific community .",
    "this includes beamline scientists designing beamlines for coherent applications , or experimentalists planning experiments with coherent beams .",
    "a beamline scientist , for example , would like to estimate the performance of optics in the partially coherent beam emerging from a synchrotron source .",
    "nowadays , several codes are used for simulation of x - ray propagation from a source through the optical system of a beamline towards an experimental hutch .",
    "most of them are based either on the ray tracing approach ( shadow @xcite , ray @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ ) which is , in fact , the geometrical optics limit , or on the fourier optics approach ( phase @xcite , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "it will be shown in our paper that the first approach of ray tracing can be safely used for synchrotron radiation in the horizontal direction , where the radiation field is mostly incoherent , but can not be used in the vertical direction , where the radiation from the undulator sources is highly coherent .",
    "unfortunately , the approach of fourier optics in the description of the scattering of synchrotron radiation in the vertical direction is also limited when the radiation is not fully coherent but rather partially coherent .",
    "simulations performed for the xfel sources at their saturation @xcite suggest that these sources are not fully coherent , and as a consequence , partial coherence effects must be carefully considered for them as well .",
    "the contribution of partial coherence effects is also important in phase retrieval as a reduced coherence of the incoming beam can produce artifacts in reconstructed images @xcite .",
    "different approaches may be used to analyze the coherence properties of the synchrotron and xfel sources .",
    "one is based on a detailed modeling of the radiation process of ultrarelativistic particles in a storage ring or an insertion device ( see for e.g. @xcite ) , or a detailed modeling of the sase process by performing calculations of nonlinear electromagnetic equations at different conditions of operation ( linear regime , saturation , etc . ) @xcite .",
    "another possible approach is based on the results of statistical optics @xcite , when the statistics of the radiation wavefield is analyzed with the very general assumptions about the origin of the radiators @xcite .",
    "an attractiveness of this approach is based on the fact that with just a few parameters the coherence properties of the beam can be described at different distances from the source .",
    "a famous example of such an approach is the van cittert - zernike theorem g85,mw95 that predicts the coherence properties of an incoherent source at any distance from that source .",
    "the most important assumption when deriving this theorem is that the source is completely incoherent .",
    "this means that there are no correlations between any two points of the source at any separation between these two points . as such",
    ", it does not require a detailed description of the physical origin of the radiation process of the source .",
    "this theorem is widely applied for the estimate of the coherence properties of 3-rd generation synchrotron sources .",
    "this is based on the assumption that each electron in the electron bunch is radiating independently from another electron , which means the radiation should be considered as incoherent . however , this assumption , which is absolutely correct from the point of radiation physics , brings us to a certain contradiction when a radiation field at a large distance from a synchrotron source is analysed .",
    "the van cittert - zernike theorem gives a realistic estimate of the coherence length downstream from the source , but at the same time it predicts that such a source should radiate in the solid angle of @xmath0 as a completely incoherent source .",
    "however , it is well known from electrodynamics ( see for e.g. @xcite ) that ultrarelativistic particles radiate mostly in the forward direction in a narrow cone @xmath1 around the direction of the velocity vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the velocity of the particle and @xmath4 is the speed of light . as a consequence , typical x - ray beams produced by synchrotron radiation sources",
    "have a beam character with a narrow cone and negligible radiation in all other directions .",
    "the only way to solve this contradiction in the frame of statistical optics is to assume a certain degree of coherence for a synchrotron source . with this approach",
    "we will substitute a real synchrotron source by an _",
    "equivalent source _ with a certain source size and , what is especially important , a finite degree of coherence that will produce wavefields with the same statistical properties as a radiation field from a real source . with these general assumptions",
    "we will use the results of statistical optics to calculate the statistical properties of beams emerging from a new source , petra iii , at different distances from the source .",
    "we use a different approach for the description of the coherence properties of the fels .",
    "these highly coherent sources can be described with a finite number of transverse modes .",
    "we will use a decomposition of the statistical fields into a sum of independently propagating transverse modes and calculate correlation fields at different distances from the source . the source itself",
    "will be described by the same gaussian functions , as in the case of the synchrotron radiation , but clearly with different values of the source parameters .",
    "recently , we characterized the coherence properties of flash using this method @xcite .",
    "for the calculations in this paper we will consider the concrete example of the european xfel sase1 undulator source @xcite",
    ". we will show that for this source only a few modes contribute substantially to the total radiation field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the basic equations of statistical optics will be presented . in section three",
    "this general approach will be applied for the characterization of the statistical properties of the beams emerging from the 3-rd generation synchrotron sources . in section four",
    "the coherent - mode representation of wavefields will be used for the characterization of the coherence properties of the xfel beams .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions and an outlook . in the appendix",
    "we compare results obtained in this paper with the theoretical approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculation of coherence properties of radiation emerging from the undulator sources .",
    "the central concept in the theory of partial coherence is the so - called mutual coherence function ( mcf ) , @xmath5 , that describes the correlations between two complex scalar values of the electric field at different points @xmath6 and @xmath7 and at different times .",
    "it is defined as @xcite @xmath8where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the field values at the points @xmath6 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the time delay , and brackets @xmath13 mean an averaging over times @xmath14 much longer than the fluctuation time of the x - ray field",
    ". it is also assumed that the radiation is ergodic and stationary . from the definition of the mcf it follows that when two points coincide an averaged intensity is given by @xmath15it is usual to normalize the mcf as@xmath16which",
    "is known as the complex degree of coherence . for all values of the arguments @xmath17 and @xmath12 the absolute value of the complex degree of coherence @xmath18 .    following",

    "light the complex degree of coherence can be approximated by @xmath30 leading to a relationship @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the average frequency . in the same conditions ,",
    "similar relationships can be obtained for the spectral density and the average intensity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the delta function . as a consequence , for narrow bandwidth light ,",
    "the spectral density is equivalent to the average intensity .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , that under very general conditions , one can represent the csd of a partially coherent , statistically stationary field of any state of coherence as a sum of independent coherent modes @xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , that satisfy the fredholm integral equation of the second kind@xmath38the eigenfunctions in ( [ 2.11]-[2.12 ] ) form an orthogonal set .    according to the definition of the spectral density , @xmath22 , ( [ 2.6 ] )",

    "in this section we apply the general theory of the propagation of gaussian optical beams from a source of any state of coherence to the case of synchrotron radiation .",
    "we assume that a _ real _ synchrotron source ( for example an insertion device like an undulator ) can be represented by its _",
    "equivalent _ model that produces x - ray radiation with statistical properties similar to a real x - ray source .",

    ", the main approximations are that the source is modeled as a plane two - dimensional source , that the spectral density , @xmath62 , and the sdc , @xmath63 , ( [ 3.2 ] ) are gaussian functions , and that the source is spatially uniform ( sdc @xmath64 depends only on the difference of spatial coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "the fact that synchrotron radiation sources are typically elongated in the horizontal direction is specifically introduced in the expression ( [ 3.2 ] ) by allowing the source size @xmath58 and coherence length of the source @xmath61 to be different in @xmath59- and @xmath66- direction .",
    "what is especially important in this model is the assumption of a certain degree of coherence of the source expressed by a finite coherence length of that source @xmath61 . only with this finite coherence length of the source it is possible to get a reasonable description of the synchrotron radiation with its extremely small divergence .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that with a suitable choice of source size , @xmath67 , and coherence length , @xmath68 , a gsm source can generate a field whose intensity has appreciable values only within a narrow cone of solid angle . in optics radiation with a narrow angular divergence is called a beam .",
    "this will be a good model for x - ray beams generated by insertion devices , such as undulators , which produce x - ray beams with a divergence of a few micro radians . in order to generate the beam",
