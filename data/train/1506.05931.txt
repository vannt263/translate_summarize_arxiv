    "understanding how and at what rate stars form from cool atomic and molecular gas ( @xmath14 ) is one of the crucial questions of modern astrophysics .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) is well measured from uv , optical , infrared and radio continuum observations , and is found to increase by an order of magnitude over the redshift interval of @xmath15 @xcite . by comparison , the evolution of the atomic and molecular cosmic gas density appears to be less dramatic with recent galaxy evolution models suggesting that there may only be a weak evolution of cosmic gas density at @xmath16 if there exists a self - regulated equilibrium between the inflow of gas into galaxies and the sfr , @xcite .",
    "however , better observations are necessary to further develop these models and to better understand the balance between gas accretion , star formation and feedback .",
    "measurements of the @xmath17 density ( e.g. @xcite ) are unfortunately not easy , as the molecule does not possess a low - energy rotational transition . instead , we are dependent on the use of co as a proxy , with its uncertain dependence on optical depth , metallicity and the radiation field .",
    "more accurate observations are available for atomic hydrogen via damped lyman-@xmath18 ( dla ) systems at high redshift or via the 21  cm line in the local universe .",
    "dlas are wide absorption features caused by high column densities of @xmath0 @xmath19 ) normally associated with galaxies .",
    "dlas can be observed against bright background sources such as qsos and appear to represent objects which contain the majority of @xmath0 at redshifts @xmath20 @xcite and are therefore an important reservoir for star formation .",
    "dla measurements at @xmath21 find values of @xmath11 around double the local value @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find a 50% decrease to occur at lower redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "however , noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2012 ) use a larger sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release ( dr ) 9 sample and only find a 20% decrease over a similar range .",
    "measurements using @xmath23 systems at low - redshift dla proxies are consistent with the latter @xcite , though selection effects are uncertain and errors are high .",
    "nevertheless evolution in @xmath24 above redshift @xmath25 appears significantly lower than the corresponding evolution in the star formation rate .",
    "interpretation of 21  cm observations is more robust , but sensitivity considerations mean that observations are mainly limited to the local universe .",

    "extensive mapping of the sky has been done since the installation of multi - beam receivers on the arecibo , parkes and effelsberg telescopes , which transformed these telescopes into powerful survey facilities .",
    "this resulted in a significant increase in the area surveyed and the number of galaxies detected . in terms of redshift , however , these surveys are still limited to @xmath26 .",

    "target galaxies for deep 21  cm observations are therefore normally preselected .",
    "for example , @xcite targeted galaxies up to @xmath49 to look for the most @xmath0-massive objects , selecting them by their h-@xmath18 emission . @xcite and",
    "@xcite targeted clusters with redshifts about @xmath50 to increase the chance of detection .",
    "such a strategy leads to samples that are biased towards galaxies with high surface brightness in optical bands .",
    "furthermore , in order to extend beyond the local universe , such surveys need to be very sensitive . with that in mind",
    ", we commenced the arecibo ultra deep survey ( auds ) - a blind 21  cm survey with the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) to search for 21  cm @xmath0 line emission at redshifts between 0 and 0.16 , the limit of the receiver .",
    "the auds precursor observations @xcite were an important test of the feasibility of such a survey .",
    "the precursor survey detected 18 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath51 with a total integration time of 53  hr .",
    "while this provided a measurement of @xmath52 in good agreement with measurements in the local universe , the auds precursor was limited to a very small region with few detections and covered only a limited range of redshifts .",
    "small number statistics and cosmic variance were therefore problems , resulting in large errorbars .    in this paper , we present results of 60% of the data from the full survey .",
    "it is a fully sampled and a significantly more sensitive data set than the precursor observation , providing a larger sample of direct 21  cm detections .",
    "the total integration time is eight times larger than that of the precursor survey .",
    "this paper allows a preliminary release for galaxies so far detected , and makes significant advances in the understanding of the evolution of the @xmath0 mass function ( himf ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55and @xmath56 .",
    "the primary goal of auds is to systematically survey the cosmic @xmath0 density @xmath57 in a volume that is beyond the local universe to a sensitivity that has not been probed before .",
    "the strategy of the survey is therefore orthogonal to other current single - dish @xmath0 surveys in the sense that auds covers a very small area on the sky using the most sensitive 21  cm system currently available and using a very long integration time .",
    "our goal was to achieve an exposure time of about 40  hr per pointing , and a total of 1000  hr of observing time ( including overheads ) were assigned to this project . to cover the field in the most uniform and sensitive way",
    ", we used the `` drift and chase '' mode which we extensively tested and refined during our precursor observations @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy was to carry out repeated drift scans over the same field .",
    "to optimise uniformity of the sky coverage , the feed array was rotated to ensure equal spacing between the beams . due to the elliptical projection of the array onto the sky",
    "the rotation angle varies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the orientation of the array relative to the scan direction is shown in figure [ fig : beam1 ] .",
    "idealised relative positions of the seven independent alfa beams . for auds",
    "the beams are rotated between @xmath58 and @xmath59 to achieve a uniform coverage of the survey area . ]",
    "one major difference with the precursor observations was that , with significantly more observing time available , we were able to nyquist - sample the sky using short adjacent drift scans that were offset in declination by 0.1 of the beam size .",
    "this enabled much more accurate determination of source positions ( limited only by signal - to - noise ratio ) and source fluxes .",
    "all observations were carried out at night time to achieve the best baselines and lowest system temperature . in order to be able to schedule observations for the project throughout the year",
    ", we elected to divide the total area into two fields at opposite right ascension within the sdss footprint .",
    "the size of the individual field areas was determined by science goals and telescope limitations .",
    "a small area is required to go deep . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper redshift limit of alfa means that once sufficient sensitivity to low - mass galaxies is obtained , it is then better to go wide",
    ". edge effects such as loss of sensitivity make it inefficient to consider fields which are smaller than half a square - degree in size .",
    "telescope start - up delays make it inefficient to consider drift scans much shorter than a degree in length .",
    "the goal of auds is to carry out an unbiased , sensitive survey outside the local universe .",
    "our original goal was to be able to detect galaxies with @xmath60 of neutral hydrogen at the frequency limit of the alfa receiver @xmath61 . in order to sample independent volumes",
    ", we chose to observe two independent fields that contain no known clusters . because of the long necessary integration times , the surveyed fields are necessarily small @xmath62 each , corresponding to a total volume of @xmath63 . for efficient surveying , the two regions should differ in right ascension as much as possible , and be located at a declination where they can be tracked for the maximum time possible at arecibo .",
    "another criterion for the selection of our fields was that they were within the sdss survey region .",
    "we also tried to avoid bright continuum sources as much as possible .",
    "the brightest continuum source in field  1 is @xmath64 and in field  2 @xmath65 .",
    "we used a `` drift and chase '' mode for the observations .",
    "each auds scan consists of 230 individual spectra for each beam and polarisation , with each successive spectrum integrated over 1  s while the telescope covers 1  s in right ascension .",
    "the spectra from the seven alfa beams were recorded using the mock spectrometer dividing each spectra into two intermediate frequency ( if ) sub - bands , each @xmath66 wide . the high frequency",
    "if is centred at @xmath67 and the low frequency if is centred at @xmath68 .",
    "combined they cover the whole bandpass range of the alfa receiver of @xmath69 with a spectral resolution of @xmath70      the bandpass removal and calibration was done using the multi - beam single - dish data reduction software ` livedata ` .",
    "details of the steps of the reduction process are described in @xcite . as ` livedata ` was originally developed to reduce data from the parkes telescope for hipass",
    ", the program was adapted to suit the different settings of the arecibo telescope including the handling of different types of fits files and other arecibo specific issues such as calibration .",
    "each individual spectrum with 1  s integration time has a root mean square ( rms ) of about 50  @xmath71 . to convert the individual spectra into regular gridded position - position - velocity cubes we use the software ` gridzilla`@xmath72 . for the final gridded data cubes , data from all beams and polarisations",
    "were combined .",
    "` gridzilla ` calculates the contribution of every individual spectrum to each pixel of the grid and calculates the final value of the pixel based on the contributing spectra and the assigned weights .",
    "the weights were determined by the distance of spectra from the beam centre .",
    "we used a weighted median statistic to combine the spectra .",
    "the data values were first sorted , and their weights were summed .",
    "the weighted median is then the data value for which the sum of the weights is half the total weights . @xcite",
    "have shown that using a median estimator was very successful for hipass in removing small amounts ( less then 40% ) of bad data ( caused by rfi etc ) with the downside of increasing the noise level by at least @xmath73 .",
    "however , on occasion , the auds data show much more significant levels of bad data ( figure [ fig : rfio_perc ] ) , especially in the frequency range of @xmath74 , necessitating further measures .",
    "several sources of strong rfi , like the radar in punta salinas and transmissions from the nearby airport interfere in this frequency range . additionally ,",
    "several satellites ( e.g. gps , galileo and glonass ) transmit in this frequency range .",
    "while the rfi emitted from the radar are narrow in frequency and pulsed in time , the rfi from the satellites span a wide frequency range , but do not occur at all times .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to further mitigate against the rfi problem , we used a flagging routine applied to the bandpass - corrected data as follows :    1 .",
    "the rms in a rfi - free region is estimated .",
    "the rfi free region was chosen by examination of several time - frequency images .",
    "a @xmath75 mask is created where zero corresponds to valid pixels and one to masked pixels .",
    "the mask is grown by smoothing it with a hanning kernel of the size 55 pixel ( time - frequency domain ) which results in values between zero and one .",
    "pixels where the values of the mask is above 0.1 are flagged and ignored during the gridding of the data .",
    "this process is repeated three times before the data is gridded into data cubes .",
    "an example of the mask and flagging is shown in figure [ fig:3 - 3mask ] .",
    "to search for galaxies , position - velocity images were searched by eye to create a list of galaxy candidates . due to the varying noise and strong rfi at higher redshift , available",
    "automated source finders were not able to create a usefully short candidate list . to create the source list",
    "the cubes were searched by three members of the auds team . each tried to identify every possible candidate , even those that were unlikely to be significant detections .",
    "together , 294 unique candidates were identified and a preliminary source list was created . in a second step , a single person inspected each spectrum and image in positionvelocity space from the merged list .",
    "spectra were extracted and fitted and a shorter source list created based on the final inspection of each candidate .",
    "it was important to carefully distinguish between real galaxies and spurious detections based on their signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , their spectral line shape and the shape of the detections in the image plane .",
    "special attention was taken to distinguish between real sources and rfi . in many cases",
    "a clear distinction was possible given their very different signatures in the position - velocity plane , rfi often being narrow in frequency and visible over large ranges in right ascension / declination .",
    "however , at low snr , the distinction is not as clear .",
    "candidates close to , or overlapping with known rfi were treated especially carefully to ensure they were real and that the bandpass was fitted correctly .",
    "this resulted in a shorter list of 133 likely candidates , five of which were common between the overlapping bands leaving 128 candidates .",
    "we then used the completeness coefficient @xmath76 , derived from the simulation discussed in section [ sub : completeness ] , to create a final source list .",
    "@xmath76 uses the integrated flux @xmath77 , the velocity width @xmath78 and the rms @xmath79 , of each galaxy to calculate the probability of detecting a galaxy in the survey . if @xmath80 the galaxy was retained in the sample .",
    "the final sample consists of parameterisation of the galaxies was performed using the task ` mbspect ` which is part of the radio astronomy data reduction package ` miriad ` @xcite .",
    "the galaxy position estimated from the manual search was more precisely determined by fitting a gaussian to the velocity integrated image ( 0th moment ) over a width of 5 - 9 arcmin around the input position assuming the galaxies are point sources .",
    "this is a good approximation as the beam size at the mean redshift of the galaxies in the sample ( @xmath81 is about @xmath82 in diameter .",
    "additionally we also looked at the optical diameter ( petrosian diameter in the @xmath83-band ) of the auds galaxies we could cross match to sdss galaxies ( details are given in section [ sub : optical - counterpart ] ) and found that 95% of galaxies are smaller than 1.2  arcmin . this would allow the @xmath0 disk to exceed the optical diameter by up to three times and still be within the alfa beam .",
    "next the spectra were optimally extracted , also using the ` miriad ` function ` mbspect ` , at the new position using a window of 5 - 9 arcmin , weighting neighbouring pixels by the beam shape . the velocity range occupied by the detected galaxy",
    "was masked out , before a polynomial was fitted to the baseline .",
    "the spectral width @xmath78 and the central velocity of the profiles were measured .",
    "the fit also provided @xmath77 , @xmath84 and the peak snr .",
    "the fluxes were measured assuming the galaxies are point sources . using @xmath77 and the luminosity distance @xmath85 of the galaxies we calculate @xmath86    @xmath87    the @xmath0 masses of the auds galaxies as a function of their distance",
    "is presented in figure [ fig : mhi_hist ] .",
    "the bivariant distributions as well as single parameter histograms of the galaxy parameters ( @xmath88 , @xmath77 , @xmath84 , @xmath78 ) are shown in figure [ fig : par ] .",
    "the redshift histogram shows that we did not detect any galaxies with @xmath89 . detecting @xmath0 galaxies at high redshift proved challenging as the rfi environment at arecibo is very hostile , especially for @xmath90 .",
    "both auds fields were chosen to overlap with the sdss footprint . searching the sdss dr7 catalogue we find field 1 has 25 galaxies and field 2 has 56 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range of auds .",
    "additionally there are 11588 galaxies with only photometric redshifts in field 1 and 9932 galaxies in field 2 .",
    "we used the sdss to find optical counterparts for the auds galaxies and found that 36 out of @xmath4 have spectroscopically confirmed counterparts and that at least one of the auds galaxies is a pair .",
    "optical galaxies are identified as matches when they are within a two arcmin radius around the @xmath0 position and the difference with the spectroscopic redshift is smaller than @xmath91 . taking the position ( inside the beam ) , the size , inclination and colour of the galaxy into account we identify another 18 likely optical counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig : raerr ] ( left panel ) shows the offset between the position of the optical counterparts as given by the sdss and the positions measured from the @xmath0 data for both the galaxies with optical counterparts with spectroscopic redshifts as well as the galaxies with likely counterparts with photometric redshifts .",
    "we also show the difference between the optical redshift and @xmath0 redshift in the right panel of the same figure .         even though the overall number of galaxies with reliable optical information is small , some trends are clearly visible ( figure [ fig : opt_count ] ) .",
    "there is a correlation between the detectability of a galaxy and its @xmath83-band luminosity as the sdss is a magnitude but not volume - limited sample .",
    "this also becomes evident when one compares the luminosity of the optical counterparts with and without spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "galaxies with higher masses at a certain redshift are more likely to have spectroscopic counterparts .",
    "the second trend is that lower mass galaxies are predominately blue galaxies @xmath92 and less likely to have spectroscopic information .",
    "redder galaxies are only found at large @xmath93 .",
    "this is expected as bluer galaxies tend to be more gas rich .",
    "red galaxies on the other hand tend to have lower gas mass fractions but are significantly more massive and luminous .",
    "that makes them easier to detect in optical surveys especially at higher redshift where the survey volume is larger .",
    "this means that non - volume limited @xmath0 surveys tend to be biased against red galaxies with increasing redshift .",
    "we leave the more detailed discussion of optical properties as well as a stacking analysis for a later paper .",
    "the completeness of a survey is defined as the fraction of a certain type of galaxy which can be detected by a survey from the underlying distribution of objects down to the detection limit of the survey . estimating the completeness of auds is a crucial step to understand the underlying galaxy population .        a good way to determine",
    "the completeness of the sample is to insert synthetic galaxies into the data and test the rate with which these galaxies are detected .",
    "this allows us to determine a completeness limit as a function of @xmath77 as well as @xmath78 and the single pixel noise @xmath79 . to take the noise into account we defined a noise weighted integrated flux @xmath94 .    to insert the galaxies we chose three representative subregions in the data cube of field 1 : one rfi free region ( @xmath95 ) ; one region moderately affected by rfi @xmath96 ; and one region with high rfi occupancy @xmath97 .",
    "each region is @xmath98 wide . in total 356 synthetic galaxies",
    "were inserted into the subcubes .",
    "the parameters for the synthetic galaxies were randomly chosen from an integrated flux range of @xmath99 to @xmath100 and a width range @xmath55of @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "varying the width of the galaxies takes both variation due to different rotational velocities as well as different inclination into account .",
    "the shapes of the galaxy spectra were described by a busy function @xcite .",
    "the data cubes were searched blindly in the same way as the original data cubes and 256 of the galaxies in the mock sample could be recovered . from the ratio of the number of detected galaxies @xmath103 to the number of all galaxies",
    "@xmath104 the completeness in logarithmic flux and linear @xmath78 bins can be computed .",
    "the dependency of the completeness on @xmath78 and @xmath77 as well as @xmath78 and @xmath105 , shown in figure [ fig : comp3d ] resembles an error function shifted along the flux axis .",
    "we chose to describe the completeness function with the following analytic model    @xmath106    @xmath107    the four independent parameters in equation [ eq : cross2 - 1 ] and [ eq : cross2 - 1 - 1 ] were chosen to fit the features in the binned completeness data namely : ( 1 ) the completeness decreases for smaller fluxes for all values of @xmath78 ; ( 2 ) @xmath78 influences the steepness of the decrease of the completeness to zero ( narrow profiles are easier to detect ) and ( 3 ) the flux value at which the completeness essentially becomes zero .",
    "the errorbars in figure [ fig : comp3d ] indicate the @xmath108 binomial confidence interval given by @xmath109 with @xmath55@xmath110 being the number of detected synthetic galaxies in a bin , @xmath111 the number of all synthetic galaxies in that bin and @xmath112 the upper / lower limit of the confidence interval . binning data in intervals of @xmath113 and @xmath114 and fitting equation [ eq : cross2 - 1 ]",
    "gives the best - fit parameter of @xmath115 @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "using the noise weighted flux ( @xmath119 , @xmath114 ) and fitting equation [ eq : cross2 - 1 - 1 ] gives the best - fit parameter of @xmath120 @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "since the noise changes throughout the cube , we found that equation [ eq : cross2 - 1 - 1 ] is the better way to minimise the effect of the different noise levels and we therefore used @xmath124 when calculating the himf .",
    "for each galaxy in the sample we calculate the completeness coefficient by inserting the value for @xmath77 , @xmath79 and @xmath78 into equation [ eq : cross2 - 1 - 1 ] giving us a specific value for that galaxy which represents the probability of detecting this galaxy in the sample .",
    "additionally we give the integrated flux at which a galaxy of a certain width reaches a completeness of @xmath125 in table [ tab:3 - 2-wsint ] .",
    "as before , only galaxies with completeness coefficients @xmath55@xmath126 have been accepted in the sample ( see section [ sub : the - catalogue ] ) . some of the galaxies with a completeness coefficient @xmath55@xmath127 may in fact be real , but it is not possible to use them for statistical studies .",

    "<S> the arecibo ultra deep survey ( auds ) combines the unique sensitivity of the telescope with the wide field of the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) to directly detect 21  cm @xmath0 emission from galaxies at distances beyond the local universe bounded by the lower frequency limit of alfa ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> auds has collected 700  hr of integration time in two fields with a combined area of 1.35  deg@xmath2 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present data from 60% of the total survey , corresponding to a sensitivity level of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the data reduction , the search for galaxies , parametrisation , optical identification and completeness . </S>",
    "<S> we detect @xmath4 galaxies in the mass range of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the @xmath0 mass function ( himf ) at the highest redshifts so far measured . </S>",
    "<S> a fit of a schechter function results in @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . using the measured himf </S>",
    "<S> , we find a cosmic @xmath0 density of @xmath9 for the sample ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss further uncertainties arising from cosmic variance . because of its depth , auds is the first survey that can determine parameters for the @xmath0 mass function in independent redshift bins from a single homogeneous data set . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate little evolution of the co - moving mass function and @xmath11 within this redshift range . we calculate a weighted average for @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 , combining the results from auds as well as results from other 21  cm surveys and stacking , finding a best combined estimate of @xmath13 .    </S>",
