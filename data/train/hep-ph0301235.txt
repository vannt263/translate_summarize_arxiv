    "the pion charge form factor has been the object of many studies  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the system , a quark  anti - quark bound state , and the availability of experimental data  @xcite make it very attractive to test both physical ingredients and methods employed in its calculation . in view of a strongly bound system (",
    "if one assumes constituent quark masses of the order of a few hundred mev ) and the large @xmath0 at which the pion form factor has been measured , a relativistic calculation is most likely required .",
    "there are various approaches to implement relativity , ranging from field theory to relativistic quantum mechanics . among the latter ones ,",
    "calculations of the pion form factor have been done in instant and front forms  @xcite .",

    "the elastic form factor is the relative velocity of the initial and final states .",
    "thus , in the breit frame , the form factor depends on the momentum transfer @xmath0 only through the quantity , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total mass of the system .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that the squared charge radius of the system scales like @xmath3 , and therefore tends to @xmath4 when @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "accordingly , the charge radius increases when the system becomes stronger bound , contrary to physical intuition . for the pion",
    ", this argument suggests that the squared charge radius should be of the order of @xmath5 , which exceeds the experimental value by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "in contrast to this result , the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite shows nice agreement .",
    "furthermore , these authors show that , in the case of an infinitely bound system , the form factor could scale like @xmath6 for large momentum transfers , in agreement with the qcd expectation  @xcite .",
    "however , the general derivation of this result does not imply any assumption on the binding of the system .",
    "motivated by the above observations , we re - examine in this letter the `` point - form '' calculation of the pion form factor . while doing so , we also have in mind the failure of the approach when applied to a system made of scalar constituents  @xcite",
    ". the main goal of this study is a clarification of the above - mentioned peculiarities connected with recent implementations of the `` point - form '' of relativistic hamiltonian mechanics .",

    "as it can be observed from eqs .",
    "( [ 3c ] ) and  ( [ 3e ] ) , the squared charge radius scales like the inverse squared pion mass , confirming the hand - waving argument given in the introduction and , at the same time , the consequence that the charge radius increases with increasing binding energy !",
    "the second observation is that the squared charge radius has a minimum value , as a function of the open parameters , that depends on the pion mass .",
    "it slightly differs with the model ( @xmath46 for the gaussian wave function and @xmath47 for the hulthn one ) .",
    "however , even this minimal values , ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) exceed by far the experimental one , @xmath50  @xcite . independently",
    ", the contribution of the bare matter radius of the pion to these values is not small .",
    "this part , @xmath51 , is enhanced by @xmath52 , which amounts to a factor @xmath53 - @xmath54 for quark masses in the range of @xmath55 - @xmath56 gev . for a squared matter radius of @xmath57 , of the order of what is generally predicted by quark models , the corresponding squared charge radius is already of the order of the experimental one .",
    "the existence of a minimum value largely exceeding the experimental one has the striking consequence that there is no way to fit the parameters of the model to reproduce the experimental pion form factor .",
    "the asymptotic form factor for a system made of spin-1/2 constituents is expected to scale like @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the coefficient of the @xmath58 factor should be proportional to the strength of the short range quark - quark interaction ( up to log terms ) and to the square of the wave function at the origin .",
    "these expectations are independent of any assumption on the mass of the constituents or on the size of the system .",
    "evidently , the gaussian model can not reproduce the correct power law behavior of form factors in general . only in the zero - size limit , when @xmath59 , one obtains @xmath60 .",
    "apart from the fact that the power of @xmath61 is not the right one , the overall coefficient does not scale like the strength of the quark - quark interaction . this illustrates the statement that reproducing the qcd power - law behavior with gaussian wave functions and standard currents is most surely the consequence of a mistake in the theoretical approach employed to get the result .",
    "not surprisingly , form factors calculated with hulthn wave functions provide a power law behavior ( @xmath62 ) , which , however , differs from what is expected .",
    "for a large part , this is in relation with the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite that the transferred momentum to the struck particle in the `` point - form '' approach is @xmath63 $ ] rather than @xmath0 .",
    "a better result is obtained in the limit @xmath64 , in which case the wave function , eq .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) , scales like @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 .",
    "this limit however corresponds to a zero - range force , which is difficult to imagine for an effect dominated by one - gluon exchange .",
    "apart from that , one can check that the expression of the form factor , eq .",
    "( [ 3d ] ) , has at least some of the appropriate properties which can be easily checked in the coulombian case , eq .",
    "( [ 3 g ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in the expression for the asymptotic form factor , @xmath67 , splits into a factor @xmath68 , representing the square of the wave function at the origin , and a factor @xmath37 which involves the strength of the short - range force ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the same observation applies to the hulthn wave function .",
    "concerning the asymptotic behavior itself , one generally refers to the @xmath58 power law from qcd but it seems that this is not what one should expect from a relativistic quantum mechanics calculation based on a single - particle current .",
    "calculations in the light front approach  @xcite , in the instant form and in the present work ( after disentangling the effect of the modified momentum transfer discussed above ) , rather indicate a @xmath70 asymptotic behavior , like for scalar constituents .",
    "one has to rely then on two - body currents to get the correct @xmath58 behavior .",
    "it can be checked that this behavior is obtained without any problem from a single particle current in the case of a scalar probe .",
    "this indicates that the different power law obtained for spin-1/2 constituents has its origin in the specific form of the coupling between quarks and photons ( see below ) .",
    "results presented above significantly differ from those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the charge radius was correctly reproduced . for an unknown reason , a factor @xmath71 was introduced in the relation between the momentum of the pion in the breit frame and the momentum transfer , @xmath72 ( see eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "the velocity @xmath73 , which is the relevant parameter in the present `` point - form '' approach , thus becomes : @xmath74 with the last expression , all problems related to the limit @xmath75 vanish .",
    "there is no more lower bound for the squared charge radius that prevents one from making a fit of the form factor to experimental values .",
    "while the above modification brings the pion form factor closer to those obtained in other forms , there is no justification for this change within the `` point - form '' approach .",
    "evidently , the more reasonable character of the results obtained with this correction suggests that there may be some truth in it @xcite but no tentative explanation was presented by the authors .",
    "the other difference concerns the asymptotic form factor obtained with a gaussian wave function .",
    "we gave arguments to discard the use of such wave functions for looking at the asymptotic behavior of form factors .",
    "it however remains to explain why , in the zero - size limit , a @xmath58 behavior was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite while we get @xmath70 .",
    "this is most likely due to the matrix element of the current , which in the breit frame reads : @xmath76 our expression for the form factor implicitly accounts for the full structure of the spinors , thus evidencing some dependence on the momentum transfer , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) .",
    "this tends to reduce the value of the matrix element of the charge density . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this matrix element was assumed to be a constant : @xmath77 , which differs from eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) by a factor @xmath78 .",
    "it can be checked that a full account of eq .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) , together with the redefinition of @xmath73 as given in eq .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) and the modified relation between the momentum transfer and the momentum of the struck particle in the `` point - form '' approach , provides an extra factor @xmath79 . dividing eq .",
    "( [ 3b ] ) by this quantity , the form factor would read : @xmath80 which is close to the results of ref .  @xcite with a quark mass fitted to the experimental charge radius ( @xmath81gev ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we provide some numerical estimates for form factors calculated with gaussian and hulthn wave functions .",
    "this is done for what we consider the most preferable case with respect to a reasonable choice of parameters and a favorable comparison to experiment . for the gaussian wave function ,",
    "the parameter @xmath82 is chosen such as to get a matter radius of @xmath83 , which is at the lower bound of predictions  @xcite , giving @xmath84 .",
    "the quark mass is taken as @xmath81gev .",
    "for the hulthn wave function , we take the limit @xmath64 and the parameter @xmath37 is fixed to give the same matter radius as in the gaussian case , giving @xmath85 .",
    "the quark mass here is chosen such that @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , fig .  [ fig:2 ] contains the form factor given by eq .",
    "( [ 4d ] ) , with the redefinition of @xmath73 as discussed before , see eq .",
    "( [ 4b ] ) . with a value of @xmath81gev ,",
    "one obtains a good representation of both experimental data and results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for similar conditions . evidently , the gaussian and hulthn form factors miss the experimental values by a large factor . in the very extreme but unphysical limit of a point - like pion ,",
    "the following upper limits are obtained : @xmath87 these ones , also reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , are still far below the experimental values .",
    "in a previous work  @xcite , `` point - form '' form factors were calculated and found to evidence a large discrepancy , both at low and high @xmath0 , with what could be considered an `` exact '' calculation .",
    "the system under consideration was academic however . in the present work",
    ", we applied the same approach to the pion form factor whose low @xmath0 behavior ( related to the charge radius ) and high @xmath0 behavior are determined sufficiently well from experiment to make reliable statements .",
    "results we obtained , based on a single - particle current , evidence quite similar features : too fast fall off at both low and high @xmath0 . in the first case , they point to a squared charge radius more than one order of magnitude larger than the measured one . in the second case ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior misses by many powers of @xmath61 the @xmath6 power law expected from qcd .    for our purpose , we used simple wave functions which offer the advantage of providing analytic results .",
    "better wave functions could be used . however , the comparison with results from refs .",
    "@xcite does not show qualitative differences as far as the most striking features are concerned . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "results obtained with gaussian and hulthn wave functions are very similar . both point to an uncompressible value of the squared charge radius of the order of @xmath49 , an order of magnitude larger than the experimental value .",
    "this prevents one from making any fit to the measured form factor . at high @xmath0",
    ", the model dependence may be more important but , apart from the fact that the correct power law behavior is missed , the most favorable cases , such as the zero - size limit , are physically irrelevant . in all cases we considered , the `` point - form '' form factors are far below experimental data .",
    "present results differ strikingly from those obtained in ref .  @xcite . for the largest part",
    ", this is due to a different relation between the pion breit - frame momentum and the momentum transfer which was used by these authors , allowing them to escape the constraint of a minimum value of the squared charge radius determined by the pion mass .",
    "however , this relation has no theoretical support within the `` point - form '' approach .",
    "on the basis of a theoretical model , it was concluded in a previous work that the present implementation of the `` point - form '' approach together with a single - particle current requires major improvements  @xcite .",
    "the present results for a physical quantity , the pion form factor , lead to the same conclusion .",
    "large contributions of two - body currents are needed  @xcite .",
    "an alternative would be to improve the present implementation of the `` point - form '' approach  @xcite .",
