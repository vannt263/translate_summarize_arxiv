    "it was recently shown that a non - equilibrated energy transfer between kinetic and configuration degrees of freedom lies at the origin of a breakdown of the classical stokes - einstein relation in suspensions of particles at arbitrary concentrations @xcite .",
    "this breakdown is quantified in terms of an effective temperature , @xmath0 , that depends on the local confining forces that a tracer particle experiences during its motion through the fluid @xcite . when a constant external force , @xmath1 , is applied on the particles ,",
    "the coupling between configuration and kinetic degrees of freedom is stronger and , consequently , the corresponding effective temperature contains the effect of this external force , @xmath2 , @xcite .",
    "a similar effect has been recently reported in simulations on active non - linear microrheology of supercooled liquids in refs .",
    "@xcite in which the correspondence between simulation results and theory is remarkable , see , for instance , ref .",

    "@xcite , in which correlation functions of dynamic variables are analyzed , the same effect associated with thermal fluctuations and the effective temperature appears .",
    "we will back to this point below .",
    "if @xmath3 is the probability density in @xmath4space , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the position and velocity of a driven particle , then the heart of the statistical description of this problem is that for systems in or near an arrested state , like concentrated particle suspensions and supercooled liquids , the assumption of adiabatic decoupling @xmath7 _ is no longer valid _ , and therefore we have to use the exact definition @xmath8 which means that the different time scales of the dynamics are not well separated .",
    "this simple fact has huge implications on the scaling of the effective temperature and mobility of glasses and glass like systems . in this work ,",
    "we discuss these implications . in doing this , we provide a theoretical and conceptual framework that serves to understand , on the basis of a non - equilibrium description based on fokker - planck and smoluchowski equations , the origin of the already mentioned effective temperature and mobility , as well as to formulate a generalized version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in terms of the stokes - einstein relation , valid for far from equilibrium systems under the action of an external force .",
    "we illustrate our results by considering an ensemble of tracer particles in non - linear microrheology in atomic glasses .    the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain the physics behind the non - adiabatic decoupling of the fokker - planck description .",
    "then , insection iii we show the origin of the force dependent temperature whereas section iv is devoted to show the origin of the effective mobility within the mean field description .",
    "finally , section v discusses the generalization of the stokes - einstein relation and the summary and conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "in order to proceed , it is convenient to introduce the well - known kramers - fokker - planck equation @xmath9 which describes the dynamics of an ensemble of non - interacting brownian degrees of freedom , that is , the velocity @xmath6 and the position @xmath5 of the driven particles in contact with a heat bath . in eq .",
