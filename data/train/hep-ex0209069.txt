    "although the existence and properties of the scalar mesons @xmath1(980 ) and ( 980 ) are well established and have been known for about thirty years , the physical nature of these mesons is still unclear . the first evidence for the @xmath1  was in the reaction @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 elastic @xmath4  cross section shows a dip close to the @xmath5  threshold .",
    "similarly , in @xmath6 , a sharp onset of inelasticity indicates the presence of a dynamical structure strongly coupled to @xmath5 .",
    "evidence for strange quark content in the @xmath1  is also confirmed by @xmath7   decays .",
    "in fact , the mark - iii , dm2 , and bes collaborations measure br(@xmath7@xmath8@xmath1@xmath0)@xmath9 br(@xmath7@xmath8@xmath1@xmath10 ) . however , the result obtained by the e791 collaboration @xcite shows that 56% of the @xmath11 decay into 3@xmath12 proceeds via @xmath1 , which suggests that @xmath1   has both @xmath13 and @xmath14 components .",
    "the total width of the @xmath1  meson has been measured by several experiments and ranges between 40100 mev ; moreover , the @xmath1  is weakly coupled to photons [ @xmath15 kev ] . the first evidence for the  was found in the @xmath16 system in @xmath17 .",

    "the  also has a small width compared to ordinary mesons with the same mass , and a small @xmath18  coupling . in short , these two scalar mesons are very close in mass , and have small widths and small @xmath18  couplings .",
    "the standard interpretations of these states as @xmath19 mesons is not favoured .",
    "the total widths are much smaller than the @xmath20500 mev expected from the @xmath19 prediction , the @xmath18  partial widths measured are a factor 1020 smaller than the @xmath19 prediction , and the @xmath5  coupling is too large for an ozi - forbidden decay .",
    "the theoretical situation is further complicated because there are many scalars below 1.5 gev .",
    "many different interpretations of these states have been proposed : @xmath5  molecules @xcite , four - quark states @xcite , and , in the case of the @xmath1 , glueballs .",
    "interest in studying light scalar mesons also comes from an old suggestion by gribov that foresees the existence of a peculiar state with the vacuum quantum numbers and a mass close to the proton mass to explain quark confinement .",
    "most recently , close and trnqvist @xcite have interpreted these mesons as the higgs nonet of a hidden u(3 ) symmetry . from all of the above considerations , it is obviously urgent to clarify the situation .",
    "the radiative @xmath0 decays are very useful for addressing this puzzle .",
    "in fact , the absolute rates for @xmath0@xmath8@xmath21  and @xmath22  and the mass spectra of the @xmath1  and  are very senvitive to the nature of these scalar particles , as shown in tab .",

    "radiative decays of light vector mesons to pseudoscalars have been used as a testing ground since the early days of the quark model @xcite . the branching ratio of the decay @xmath31is particularly interesting since its value can probe the @xmath32 and gluonium content of the @xmath33@xcite . in particular , the ratio @xmath34 of the branching ratios for @xmath31and @xmath30can be related to the @xmath35-@xmath33mixing parameters @xcite and",

    "it is therefore safe to use a single mixing angle in this basis .",
    "the measurements available to date on br(@xmath31 ) come from the kloe @xcite , cmd-2@xcite , and snd@xcite collaborations .",

    "the @xmath41 final state is used ; therefore , many common systematic effects approximately cancel out in the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "after the analysis , kloe finds 128 @xmath33events with an efficiency of @xmath43 and a background level of 6@xmath44 . the value @xmath45 has been obtained .",
    "this value for @xmath34 can be related directly to the mixing angle in the flavor basis .",

    "the following constraints on @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be obtained in a nearly model - independent way @xcite : @xmath56 and @xmath57 the consistency of the assumption of @xmath58 mixing without gluonium can be checked as follows : if @xmath59 , one has @xmath60 .",
    "this remains a reasonable approximation if the gluonium component is small . in fig .",

    "@xmath63 is seen to be @xmath64 , which is compatible with zero within 1@xmath65 and consistent with a gluonium fraction of less than 15% .",

    "the branching ratios for @xmath0@xmath8  and  and the @xmath1  and  coupling constants have been measured with the best accuracy by the kloe collaboration and are in agreement with cmd-2 and snd results .",
    "there is still much to do in this field and more data are expected from kloe and from other experiments ( @xmath66 decays etc ) . in the pseudoscalar sector there is a new , precise measurement of br(@xmath31 ) and the @xmath35-@xmath33mixing angle .    99 e.m .",
