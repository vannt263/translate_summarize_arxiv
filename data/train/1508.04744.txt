    "a markovian system is one in which the future time evolution depends only on the current state , and not on its history  @xcite . in the context of open quantum systems",
    ", markovianity generally implies that the reduced density operator obeys a first - order differential equation .",
    "this class of theory has been developed for many years , is applied to a vast range of systems , and provides our understanding of quantum damping and decoherence  @xcite .",
    "recent work , however , presents it with challenges .",
    "the development of solid - state quantum emitters , such as single and coupled quantum dots  @xcite and superconducting - qubit cavities  @xcite , demands theories capable of treating driven or coupled systems damped by complex structured baths  @xcite .",
    "such theories reveal , among other effects , the possibility of engineering the reservoirs to control quantum coherence  @xcite .",
    "they show that under appropriate conditions both quantum coherence  @xcite and entanglement  @xcite can survive indefinitely , even for high temperature baths  @xcite .",
    "these problems do not necessarily elude treatment by a time - local theory , i.e. , a ( markovian ) quantum master equation .",
    "such theories accurately reproduce the intensity - dependent damping of quantum dots in a structured reservoir  @xcite , for example , and provide recent predictions of bath - induced coherence  @xcite and entanglement  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several master equations consistent with , and derivable from , the assumption of weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , master equations are often postulated phenomenologically , by choice of the jump operators in the lindblad form . for problems with multiple oscillators and structured baths",
    "this choice is not straightforward , with different choices plausible in different limits . nor",
    "is it innocent : different forms of master equation lead to different behavior  @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to establish which , if any , of the various time - local theories is correct .    in this paper",
    "we address this question by studying an exactly - solvable model , and comparing the exact solution against various time - local theories .",
    "we consider a model of two bosonic modes , @xmath0 , with frequencies @xmath1 , coupled to a thermally - occupied bath with spectral density @xmath2 .",
    "this model has a non - trivial hamiltonian , multiple degrees - of - freedom , and frequency - dependent damping , yet is exactly solvable .",
    "we consider the general case where the natural frequencies @xmath1 differ and the bath couples to a superposition of modes , @xmath3 , and calculate the evolution of the coherence , @xmath4 .",
    "we find a complex behavior with multiple regimes , visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , reflecting the competing effects of the system hamiltonian and the coupling to the bath .",
    "we will compare the exact solution with time - local theories , and so identify those which correctly capture such physics .",
    "this allows us to establish their validity in a generic problem , and avoids the difficulty inherent in studying only approximate theories .",
    "a physical issue we will address is the appropriate form of dissipator for systems with multiple components .",
    "two different forms are expected on physical grounds  @xcite . in the case of the two - oscillator model",
    "it is clear that at resonance , @xmath5 , the damping can depend only on the pattern of coupling to the baths .",
    "thus we expect collective decay , described by a lindblad form @xmath6 + \\gamma^\\uparrow \\mathcal{l}[{\\varphi}_a{\\hat{\\psi}}_a^\\dagger + { \\varphi}_b { \\hat{\\psi}}_b^\\dagger]$ ] , where @xmath7 $ ] is the standard dissipator with jump operator @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "far off - resonance , however , we expect individual decay terms , @xmath9 + \\sum_{i}\\gamma_i^\\uparrow \\mathcal{l}[{\\hat{\\psi}}_i^\\dagger]$ ] .",
    "the first form predicts a non - zero steady - state coherence , while the second predicts this vanishes . we will show that neither of these forms is , in general , correct , and both make misleading predictions outside of limiting cases .",
    "nonetheless , we will find that the general behavior can be accurately treated by a time - local theory , specifically a bloch - redfield equation .",
    "while one might navely have expected some smooth crossover between the limits captured by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the real answer is more subtle : a smooth interpolation exists for the equations - of - motion , but the steady - state is _ singular _ at degeneracy .",
    "this allows mutually exclusive behavior in different regimes , and implies that some useful effects  specifically the protection of coherence against the bath  are critically sensitive to microscopic parameters .",
    "moreover , while the crossover can be treated by a time - local theory , this theory is not a lindblad form with the required positive rates .",
    "the use of such forms is the subject of ongoing debate , since they are not completely positive maps @xcite .",
    "this means that they can lead to unphysical density operators , with negative eigenvalues .",
    "a methodological issue in this debate is the procedure of secularization .",
    "this amounts to removing from the equations - of - motion those terms which are time dependent in the interaction picture .",
    "it was used in some of the earliest work on quantum damping by bloch and wangsness  @xcite , but was then argued to be unnecessary by redfield  @xcite as well as bloch  @xcite .",
    "that position was challenged by the subsequent lindblad theorem  @xcite : as argued by dmcke and spohn  @xcite , secularization is required to reach a description where lindblad s theorem ensures positivity of the density operator .",
    "indeed , lindblad s theorem guarantees that the density operator will remain positive even when there is entanglement with an auxiliary system , a criterion known as complete positivity  @xcite .",
    "secularization , which leads to a completely positive theory , is clearly appropriate when the interaction - picture time dependence is fast , since off - diagonal terms then rapidly average to zero . in our case , this is far off - resonance , and secularization indeed leads from the bloch - redfield equation to the form @xmath11 .",
    "however , for a tunable system it may occur that the the time - dependence in the interaction picture becomes slow in certain regimes , i.e. , approaching resonance , so that secularization becomes inappropriate",
    ". an interesting improved version of the secularization procedure is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , the necessity of secularization has been questioned  @xcite : simulations indicate that for time evolution following an initially prepared separable state , secularization ( and even a lindblad form for the equation of motion ) can be unnecessary for positivity  @xcite , and even complete positivity  @xcite , in particular for time - convolutionless  @xcite and nakajima - zwanzig  @xcite approaches .",
    "stronger statements to this effect have also been made by hell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , noting that a conservation law  @xcite is violated by secularized theories  we discuss this sum rule in detail further below .",
    "the question of how the operator form of time - local and non - markovian approaches are related is reviewed by karlewski and marthaler  @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is , however , on cases where a time - local description is sufficient .",
    "this will enable us to explore the entire parameter space of a model , and identify the regions where bloch - redfield equations predict physical behavior .",
    "we will show that , although the damping is not of lindblad form , the anticipated unstable behavior does not occur within the domain of applicability of the theory  specifically , so long as the bath remains markovian .",
    "the exact results we present are restricted to only a subset of possible initial density matrices .",
    "we take as initial conditions a thermal state of the bath and the ground state of the two oscillators .",
    "the reduced density matrix is then gaussian at all times , and so completely characterized by its second moments .",
    "thus we will be able to establish whether the bloch - redfield equations are accurate and physical from the dynamics of those moments alone .",
    "this does not , however , rule out inaccurate or even unphysical behavior for arbitrary ( non - gaussian ) initial density matrices .    within the scope of coupled open quantum systems , a particular motivation for our work comes from the timely theory of `` weak lasing ''  @xcite introduced in the context of polariton condensates .",
    "the idea presented is that for modes which are close to resonance the ( dissipative ) radiative coupling can select which linear combination of modes lases ( condenses ) first .",
    "these works started from a phenomenological description of radiative coupling , in which collective dissipation terms are introduced by hand .",
    "in the following we will see , however , that the effects of collective dissipation terms are strongly dependent on whether the individual modes are degenerate or not .",
    "our work does not consider the general problem with both drive and dissipation , but the results we present for coupling to a single bath suggest there may be a need to re - examine how weak - lasing evolves where radiative coupling selects superpositions of non - degenerate modes .",

    "the small residual coherence that exists away from resonance in fig .  [ fig : coherence ] is thus due to the frequency dependence of @xmath79 .",
    "so far , we have seen that the exact solution of the bosonic problem does show a crossover between strong coherence at degeneracy and weak coherence , due to a frequency - dependent spectral density , away from degeneracy .",
    "however , this crossover occurs as a function of time , with coherence surviving over a range @xmath80 .",
    "a similar quadratically diverging timescale is found in the v - type system  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to consider whether the behavior of the coherence , and other observables , can be reproduced by a time - local master equation .",
    "we may first note that neither of the nave forms ( individual or collective damping ) discussed in the introduction reproduce the correct behavior .",
    "separate decay predicts that the coherence vanishes , for all times and detunings .",
    "the collective decay model does predict a strong long - lived coherence close to resonance , and indeed a quadratically - diverging lifetime . after this time",
    ", however , the coherence decays to zero , rather than the non - zero value predicted by the exact solution .",
    "more significantly , however , the collective form fails to reproduce the behavior once the detuning becomes significant .",
    "this may be seen from the steady - state populations : for large detuning or weak - coupling these correspond to equilibrium with the bath , so @xmath81 , whereas the lindblad form gives equal populations . as pointed out by cresser for the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite",
    ", such master equations do not reach canonical equilibrium . more generally ,",
    "since @xmath10 is parameterized by one pair of forward / backward rates , it can not account for the presence of two frequencies in the dynamics at which the bath should be sampled . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , this occurs above a critical value of the detuning .",
    "thus this model can not possibly be accurate in this regime , unless the bath and its occupation are flat .",
    "thus , neither nave form of dissipator can give a full account of problems with multiple system frequencies and structured baths , particularly if one seeks to analyze coherence .",
    "unfortunately many interesting problems in solid - state quantum optics fall in this class , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we will now show , however , that a bloch - redfield equation does reproduce the correct behavior , as long as one does not secularize the final result .",
    "such an approach is frequently stated to be invalid , as it leads to negative rates and instabilities .",
    "we will however show analytically that such instabilities occur in a much restricted parameter regime , and , in fact , only when the markov approximation breaks down .",
    "the non - secularized theory is , also , often argued to be invalid on the related grounds that it is not a completely positive map , and may not even be a positive one .",
    "we will however show analytically that , although the map is not positive , it preserves positivity for almost all gaussian states .",
    "furthermore , we find numerically that these states soon dominate under the time evolution , even if dangerous ones are present in the initial conditions .    following the standard method  @xcite one finds the master equation has the form : @xmath82     + \\sum_{ij }   { l}_{ij}^\\downarrow { \\varphi}_i^\\ast { \\varphi}_j^ { }    \\left(2 { \\hat{\\psi}}^{}_j \\rho { \\hat{\\psi}}^\\dagger_i      - [ \\rho , { \\hat{\\psi}}^\\dagger_i { \\hat{\\psi}}^{}_j]_+ \\right )    \\\\+ \\sum_{ij }   { l}_{ij}^\\uparrow   { \\varphi}_i^ { } { \\varphi}_j^\\ast    \\left(2 { \\hat{\\psi}}^\\dagger_j \\rho { \\hat{\\psi}}^{}_i      - [ \\rho , { \\hat{\\psi}}^{}_i { \\hat{\\psi}}^\\dagger_j]_+ \\right).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here the hamiltonian includes lamb shifts @xmath83 .",

    "( [ eq:11 ] ) for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "here we have introduced several new pieces of notation .",
    "we have used the shorthand @xmath88 in terms of the hilbert transform ( analytic continuation ) defined previously , and have also defined hilbert transforms of the excitation ( absorption ) rate @xmath89 , and de - excitation ( emission ) rate @xmath90 . note that this means @xmath91 .",

    "moreover , we can easily see that secularizing this set of equations , as is often claimed to be a crucial step  @xcite , could only decrease the agreement : secularization can be shown to be equivalent to setting all terms involving the product @xmath100 to zero , thus removing the off - diagonal blocks of eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) and the last two elements of the vector @xmath101 .",

    "we may check that the eigenvalues @xmath116 remain positive ( stable ) as long as @xmath117 the first term is always positive , and thus instability require two conditions : firstly , it requires that @xmath118 , placing a constraint on the frequency dependence of @xmath2  typically an instability is hard to achieve if @xmath2 has only a single peak , but is possible for a multi - peaked structure . secondly , and more importantly , in order for the second term in eq .",

    "we now consider a related issue , of the extent to which the negative rates lead to unphysical density matrices with negative eigenvalues .",
    "we first summarize some standard definitions  @xcite .",
    "an operator is positive if all its expectation values are positive , and a map is positive if it is between positive operators . since density operators are positive the exact time - evolution superoperator , which is a map between density matrices , is positive .",
    "the secularized master equation in fact satisfies the stronger criterion of complete positivity , which corresponds to positivity in the presence of arbitrary entanglement with an auxiliary system .    the map given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) can be shown to be non - positive specifically because of the negative eigenvalues of the kossakowski matrices @xmath121 .",
    "to demonstrate this we suppose that @xmath86 has a negative eigenvalue , and work in its diagonal basis .",
    "we denote the field operator corresponding to the unstable ( stable ) eigenvector by @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , so that there will be terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) of the form @xmath131_+\\right)\\label{eq : unstjumpterm}\\ ] ] with @xmath132 . in general",
    "neither @xmath133 nor @xmath87 will be diagonal in this eigenbasis of @xmath86 , so that @xmath134 contains terms @xmath135 , for all pairs @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , we will have terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) from @xmath87 of the form @xmath137_+$ ] , for all such pairs .",
    "however , as positivity requires that all positive operators are mapped to positive operators , showing it is violated only requires us to construct a single counterexample of a positive operator mapped to a non - positive operator , and it is possible to do this despite the non - diagonal nature of these other terms . to construct this counterexample we suppose @xmath138 describes a pure fock state in the diagonal basis of @xmath86 , @xmath139 .",
    "this is a positive operator , which is mapped by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : unstjumpterm ] ) to @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , we see that no other term in the infinitesimal time - evolution superoperator @xmath141 generates this operator .",
    "the hamiltonian and anticommutator terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) conserve the total excitation number , while the jump terms from @xmath87 increase it .",
    "thus @xmath142 .",
    "since a positive operator @xmath143 obeys @xmath144 , this fact proves that the map has taken a positive operator to a non - positive operator .",
    "this proves that the map is not positive .",
    "it follows immediately that it is not completely positive .",
    "an analogous argument applies for a negative rate in @xmath87 .    while the bloch - redfield eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) is not positive , it nonetheless agrees well with the exact solution .",
    "this suggests that the operators which are mapped out of the physical space , such as the one constructed above , are absent from , or at least a negligible contribution to , the density matrix . to investigate this , and explore the domain of validity of the theory more generally",
    ", we consider whether the dynamics is positive for gaussian states .",
    "we consider specifically the subset of gaussian states relevant to the dynamics above , where the baths and initial conditions are such that @xmath145 .    for gaussian states",
    "the density matrix is positive if the uncertainty principle is satisfied  @xcite , which here is equivalent to @xmath29 being positive semi - definite .",
    "this follows on noting that for two oscillators any normalized linear combination of the operators @xmath146 is a lowering operator @xmath147 , with corresponding quadratures @xmath148 , and requiring @xmath149 for all such quadratures .",
    "positivity of the density matrix can thus be checked numerically by calculating the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath29 . in the bloch - redfield solution corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence](a ) we find that there is a brief transient period , up to @xmath150 , where the state violates positivity by a tiny amount .",
    "specifically , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath29 reaches @xmath151 in this regime , after which it it is always positive or zero , with typical values @xmath152 .",
    "more generally , the bloch - redfield @xmath153 agrees with the exact result to four decimal places .",
    "the error is hardly noticeable , except in that it takes the results slightly outside the physical regime at early times .",
    "the behavior discussed above can be understood by deriving the condition under which the bloch - redfield eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) preserves positivity for gaussian states . for a time increment @xmath154 the bloch - redfield eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) implies a shift in the @xmath29 , @xmath155 .",
    "since the time evolution of the density matrix is continuous it can only become unphysical if @xmath156 has a zero eigenvalue , which becomes negative under the perturbation @xmath157 .",
    "such an @xmath156 must be of the form @xmath158 with @xmath159 . from the forms of @xmath110 and @xmath101",
    "we calculate the shift matrix elements @xmath157 for the state @xmath156 .",
    "we can then calculate the shift in the zero eigenvalue perturbatively , and find it to be negative when @xmath160 <    0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this condition gives a range of @xmath161 and @xmath162 for which the minimum - uncertainty gaussian state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gscovmat ] ) , is mapped out of the space of physical states .",
    "if the rates are not too different , i.e. , the markov approximation is well satisfied , then this range is small .    in summary ,",
    "the two - mode bloch - redfield equation is positive for most gaussian states .",
    "the exceptions are rare , being the subset of minimum - uncertainty states defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : posvcrit ] ) .",
    "since the dissipation drives the system towards safe gaussian states these dominate the dynamics , even if the others are present in the initial conditions .",
    "indeed , a positivity - violating state is present in the initial condition for fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] , but its effects are transient and quantitatively small .",
    "from the above we may conclude that over a wide range of parameters the bloch - redfield theory without secularization accurately matches the exact solution , while secularization reduces the accuracy .",
    "this however leaves open an alternate question : does the br master equation , and the corresponding coupled equations of motion for @xmath31 , represent the best possible time - local theory of this problem ? in this section",
    "we show that a better set of time - local equations exists , and involves a minor change to the form of the matrix @xmath110 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "there are two motivations to suggest that an improved equation is possible .",
    "the first is that , as noted above , the br prediction for the slowest decay rate of coherence , eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) , does not match the rate derived from the poles of the exact solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "the second reason concerns sum rules as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "these state that for operators which commute with the system - bath coupling the time evolution of such operators in the full dynamics should be equal to that in the absence of system - bath coupling . for our model , the operators @xmath163 and @xmath164 obviously commute with eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . as such",
    ", their time derivatives should be the same as that following from @xmath26 alone . in terms of population equations",
    "this corresponds to the statement that @xmath165\\ ] ] should obey @xmath166 $ ] . in the case",
    "that @xmath19 are real , this means that one should have : @xmath167 one may however immediately see this does not hold for the solution eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) of our time - local master equation , unless @xmath168 .",
    "we next find an alternative time - local equation of motion for the observables @xmath31 that both satisfies this sum rule , and gives the exact eigenvalues near degeneracy .",
    "the basis of the alternate approach is to consider the born approximation for the equation of motion , before making any markov approximation .",
    "we therefore first recall the form of the integro - differential equation for the density matrix after the born approximation . in the interaction picture",
    "this has the general form : @xmath169\\ ] ] where @xmath170 is an operator in the interaction picture and @xmath171 accounts for the system - bath coupling , and the integral over the bath density of states . from this",

    "the br population equation then follows by assuming @xmath174 has a slow time dependence , and performing the integral over @xmath175 accounting only for the time dependence of the interaction picture operator @xmath176 .",
    "if we focus on late times this procedure is somewhat strange , as it is clear that for a problem which has a time - independent hamiltonian in the schrdinger picture it is the density matrix in the schrdinger picture which will be time independent . as such",
    ", an alternate procedure suggests itself : to consider @xmath177 .",
    "the explicit time dependence of this density matrix can be eliminated using @xmath178 = \\text{tr}\\left[e^{- i      \\hat{h}_0 t^\\prime } \\hat{o } e^{i \\hat{h}_0 t^\\prime }    \\rho^{(s)}\\right]$ ] so that we have : @xmath179 ,         \\hat{o}_l      \\right ]    \\right>_s\\ ] ] where @xmath180 $ ] and we have written @xmath181 . following this prescription",
    ", one can again find an equation for the vector of real quantities @xmath182 in the form @xmath183 , but the matrix @xmath184 has a different form . the matrix is now given by : @xmath185 where now @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "for want of a better name , we refer to this as the schrdinger picture bloch - redfield ( spbr ) equation .",
    "the constant vector @xmath101 is unchanged .",
    "the difference between the br and spbr equations has a simple structure : it corresponds to swapping which frequency the bath is to be sampled at in the third and fourth column .",
    "the origin of this change is the unitary transformation @xmath188 between the interaction and schrdinger pictures , which has the effect of swapping time dependence of some `` off - diagonal '' terms .",
    "these small changes to the matrix @xmath110 have several remarkable consequences .",
    "firstly we may immediately check that the sum rule as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) is now exactly satisfied .",
    "secondly , one may also consider the behavior of the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) . unlike eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) , there is no simple closed - form expression for the eigenvalues in the general case  eq .",
    "( [ eq:13 ] ) was special in having a structure that the secular equation could be written as a quadratic in @xmath189 $ ] , but this does not hold for eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "however , one can perform perturbation theory around the point @xmath41",
    ". clearly the eigenvalues of @xmath110 and @xmath184 match at this point , as the only distinctions occur if @xmath190 .",
    "thus , using standard ( non - self - adjoint ) perturbation theory in terms of the small parameters @xmath23 and @xmath191 one finds the lowest spbr eigenvalue takes the form : @xmath192 remarkably , this is identical to the exact solution , further confirming the idea that this spbr equation is an improvement over the br population equations discussed previously .",
    "as we have already seen above , the br master equation matches the exact solution well as long as damping is weak enough and the markov approximation is well justified .",
    "the decay rates near resonance have further shown that while the br master equation is correct to leading order in the damping rate , the spbr equation is correct to higher order .",
    "this suggests that as the damping rate becomes larger , the spbr may give a better numerical agreement with the exact solution .",
    "this is indeed the case , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] where we compare the steady state values of @xmath29 . comparing the coherence @xmath28",
    ", it is clear the spbr matches the exact solution better than the br approach .",
    "the lower panel shows that the two theories give very similar results for the populations .",
    "for the parameters corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence ] the br and spbr lines would be indistinguishable .",
    "note that at @xmath41 , the spbr and br formalisms are identical , and so one might expect the results to match at this point .",
    "however , the matrices @xmath110 are singular at @xmath41 ( as seen earlier from their eigenvalues ) .",
    "as such , the finite population and coherence at @xmath56 correspond to a singular limit .     between the exact ( solid ) , br master equation ( dashed ) and spbr master equation ( dotted ) , plotted for a larger bath density of states @xmath193 and all other parameters as for fig .",
    "[ fig : coherence].,width=307 ]",
    "extending either the exact solution or the br master equation to multiple baths is simple .",
    "for the br master equation , one just finds a separate set of lamb - shift terms @xmath133 and dissipator terms @xmath194 for each bath , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) involves a summation over contributions from the baths .",
    "similarly , the expressions for the matrix @xmath110 follow as before , but now with a sum over baths , and even the analytic form of the eigenvalues remains true , with @xmath195 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "the exact solution is however more complicated .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) still holds , however there is a sum over baths , and each term now acquires a bath label : @xmath196 .",
    "the last of these quantities now has a more complicated form @xmath197where the matrix @xmath198 can be defined in terms of its inverse , @xmath199_{ij } = i \\delta_{ij } ( \\omega_i - \\zeta - i0 ) + \\sum_n { \\varphi}_i^{(n)\\ast } { \\varphi}_j^{(n ) } k^{(n)\\ast}(\\zeta)$ ] .    in the presence of multiple baths ,",
    "the singular behavior at @xmath5 no longer occurs  one may check this by calculating the zeros of @xmath200 $ ] : one now finds there is no longer a zero mode , unless the coefficients @xmath201 happen to be parallel for different @xmath202 .",
    "the physical origin of this is that with multiple linearly independent baths there is no longer a linear combination of fields @xmath14 which decouples from the baths , and so all modes are damped . as such",
    ", the collective dephasing model is never correct for predicting the steady state coherence .",
    "the non - secularized br approach continues to correctly describe the system as one varies detuning .",
    "in conclusion we have compared the exact and bloch - redfield solutions for a system of two bosonic modes coupled to a common bath .",
    "the late - time behaviors show singular dependence on detuning : exactly on resonance , significant coherence exists at late times , but for arbitrarily small detuning the coherence drops to a smaller value which depends on the frequency dependence of the density of states .",
    "this singular limit appears only at late times , corresponding to a slow decay rate for coherence that vanishes at the degenerate point .",
    "all aspects of this behavior are reproduced correctly by a non - secularized bloch - redfield theory , whereas secularization leads to incorrect predictions .",
    "the bloch - redfield theory does not guarantee positivity , nonetheless one can prove that the equations describe bounded dynamics of physical observables , as long as the markov approximation remains valid . a modification to the bloch - redfield theory  assuming it is the schrdinger picture density matrix that evolves slowly , rather than the interaction picture one  leads to an improved time - local theory which satisfies required sum rules and exactly matches damping rates near resonance .",
