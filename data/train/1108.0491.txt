    "this issue arises in several physical contexts .",
    "anisotropy in magnetic systems may naturally arise due to the cubic structure of the underlying lattice , giving rise to anisotropic interactions terms , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the relevance of the anisotropic perturbations determines also the nature of the multicritical behavior at the meeting point of two transition lines with different o(@xmath12 ) and o(@xmath13 ) symmetries , in particular , whether the symmetry gets effectively enlarged to @xmath14 , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "another interesting issue is the critical behavior of secondary order parameters , which are generally represented by powers of the order parameter transforming as higher representations of the o(@xmath0 ) group ; their critical behaviors can be measured in density wave systems , such as liquid crystals  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider the general problem of the o(@xmath0)-symmetric theory in the presence of an external field @xmath15 coupled to a perturbation @xmath16 .",
    "assuming @xmath16 to be an eigenoperator of the rg transformations , the singular part of the free energy for the reduced temperature @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the rg dimension of @xmath15 , and @xmath21 is a scaling function .",
    "therefore , the rg dimensions of the anisotropic external fields quantitatively control their capability to influence or change the asymptotic critical behavior when @xmath22 .    in the field - theoretical ( ft ) framework the o(@xmath0)-symmetric vector model",
    "is represented by the o(@xmath0)-symmetric landau - ginzburg - wilson theory @xmath23 , \\label{phi4h}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is an @xmath0-component real field and @xmath7 an external field .",
    "the anisotropic perturbations are conveniently classified  @xcite using irreducible representations of the o(@xmath0 ) internal group , characterized by the spin value @xmath25 .",
    "let us consider the perturbation @xmath26 defined by the power @xmath27 of the order parameter and the spin representation @xmath25 of the o(@xmath0 ) group @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath25 that is symmetric and traceless in the @xmath25 indices : @xmath30 etc ... the classification in terms of spin values is particularly convenient : ( i ) under the rg flow the operators with different spin never mix ; ( ii ) all parameters @xmath31 associated with the components of @xmath32 have the same rg dimension @xmath33 . on the other hand , operators with different @xmath27 but with the same @xmath25 mix under renormalization .",
    "the spin-0 operators are already present in the @xmath34 hamiltonian ( [ phi4h ] ) : the rg dimension of @xmath35 is related to the correlation length exponent , @xmath36 , while the rg dimension of @xmath37 ( after an appropriate subtraction to cancel the mixing with @xmath35 ) gives the leading scaling correction exponent , indeed @xmath38 .",
    "the spin-1 perturbation is related to the external field coupled to the order parameter , thus @xmath39 .",
    "is redundant  @xcite , because a hamiltonian term containing @xmath40 can be always eliminated by a redefinition of the field @xmath41 .",
    "anyway , using the equation of motion , one obtains @xmath42 .",
    "] close to four dimensions , thus for small @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , which implies that the only relevant operators have @xmath46 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this property holds up to @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , near four dimensions we can use standard power counting to verify that the perturbation with indices @xmath48 mixes with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , but their rg dimensions are significantly smaller . in principle , one should also consider terms with derivatives of the field , but again one can show that they are all irrelevant or redundant .",
    "the above arguments show that the most interesting anisotropic perturbations are represented by the spin-2 , spin-3 and spin-4 operators @xmath51 because they provide the leading effects of anisotropy for each spin sector .",
    "as we shall see , the leading rg dimensions within each spin sector , @xmath52 characterize interesting critical behaviors in various physical contexts .",
    "some @xmath53 have been already estimated by using ft approaches based on high - order perturbative calculations , and lattice techniques , such as high - temperature ( ht ) expansions and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . in table",
    "[ tabrgdimp ] we report some results for @xmath54 . in most cases",
    "these results provide already a clear indication of the relevance of the perturbation , with the only exception of the spin-4 perturbation in the o(3 ) universality class , where the value of @xmath55 is close to zero .",
    "while high - order ft results indicate the relevance of the spin-4 perturbation , the mc estimate of @xmath55 appears compatible with zero .",
    "since the issue concerning its relevance is of experimental interest , an accurate determination of @xmath56 is called for to conclusively settle it .",
    ".estimates of the rg dimensions @xmath57 of the couplings @xmath58 associated with the leading anisotropic perturbations @xmath59 for the three - dimensional o(@xmath0 ) vector universality classes with @xmath54 .",
    "we report results obtained by various methods , such as ft perturbative expansions within @xmath47 and @xmath60-expansion schemes , and lattice techniques , such as high - temperature expansions ( ht ) and finite - size scaling analyses of monte carlo simulations ( fss mc ) .",
    "notice that in the mc estimates of @xmath55 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite only statistical errors are explicitly given ; the authors write that systematic errors are likely of a similar size .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]      fixing @xmath63 we obtain @xmath64 ( with @xmath65dof=9.77/12 ) as amplitude for the differences @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 taking data only for @xmath69 we get @xmath70 @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "it is quite clear from these numbers that a linearization of the correction amplitude as a function of @xmath74 is not sufficient to compute the estimate of @xmath75 .",
