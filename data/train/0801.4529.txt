    "cosmological research is mainly concerned with time ( and in some cases space as well ) evolution of various physical parameters like scale factor , hubble parameter , matter - energy density etc .",
    "along with these parameters , in recent years a new physical entity @xmath1 has resurrected in the foreground of cosmology .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 has become an essential part of the field equations of einstein after some observational results @xcite indicated towards an accelerating universe .",
    "it is believed by most of the physicists that the cosmological parameter @xmath1 is responsible for driving the present acceleration because it can exert negative pressure . moreover , due to some fine - tuning problem ( known as cosmological constant problem ) , @xmath1 is regarded as a variable quantity rather than a constant .",
    "now , in order to specify exact time - dependence of the unknown physical quantities including @xmath1 , one has to take recourse of a relationship between cosmic pressure @xmath4 and matter - energy density @xmath5 involving the equation of state parameter @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically speaking , one variable quantity can depend on the product of two other variable quantities .",
    "so , one may construct @xmath6 as a function of time , red - shift or scale factor @xcite .",
    "in fact , values of @xmath6 at different stages of cosmic evolution suggest that it may evolve with time . as an instance , for the present pressure - less universe , the value of @xmath6 is considered as zero , whereas its value was @xmath7 in the early radiation dominated universe . however , it is convenient to consider @xmath6 as a constant quantity because observational data can hardly distinguish between a varying and a constant equation of state @xcite . here",
    "some useful limits on @xmath6 as appeared from snia data are @xmath8 @xcite whereas refined values were indicated by the combined snia data ( with cmb anisotropy ) and galaxy clustering statistics which is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "as stated above , @xmath6 may have a functional relationship with scale factor or cosmological redshift . in connection to redshift it may depend linearly , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 @xcite or it may have a non - linear relationship as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this suggests for a simple form @xmath13 which has got an explicit time dependence that disappears with the condition , @xmath14 .    using above proposition",
    ", we explore the physical features of different stages of cosmic evolution , viz .",
    ", linearly expanding and inflationary universes . for this , a phenomenological @xmath1 model is selected to solve the einstein field equations .",
    "there are mathematically motivated works  @xcite , wherein several phenomenological @xmath1 models have been investigated for time - dependent @xmath6 .",
    "the einstein field equations are @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the time - dependent cosmological term with vacuum velocity of light being unity in relativistic units .    from equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) and",
    "robertson - walker metric , we get the friedmann and raychaudhuri equations , respectively @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the scale factor and @xmath18 is the curvature constant which assumes values @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for open , flat and closed models of the universe respectively . also , @xmath22 is the hubble parameter and @xmath23 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 are the gravitational constant , matter energy density and pressure respectively . however , the generalized energy conservation law for variable @xmath23 and @xmath1 is derived by  @xcite using renormalization group theory and also by  @xcite using a formula of  @xcite . for variable @xmath1 and constant @xmath23",
    ", the generalized conservation law reduces to the form @xmath24",
    "the barotropic equation of state which relates the pressure and density of the physical system is given by @xmath25 using this equation with equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath26 for a flat universe(@xmath27 ) , equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) yields @xmath28    the equivalence of three phenomenological @xmath1-models ( viz .",
    ", @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) have been studied in detail by  @xcite for constant @xmath6 .",
    "so , it is reasonable to study a variable-@xmath1 model with a variable @xmath6 .",
    "let us , therefore , use the _ ansatz _ @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 this _ ansatz _ may find realization in the framework of self consistent inflation model  @xcite , in which time - variation of @xmath1 is determined by the rate of bose condensate evaporation  @xcite with @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the mass of bosons and @xmath36 is the planck mass ) .    from equations  ( [ eq4]),([eqstat]),([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , we get @xmath37 with @xmath38 , equation ( [ eq10 ] ) reduces to @xmath39    we would now show , how does these field equations used in conjunction with our proposition ( equation  [ omegaq ] ) encorporate both linearly expanding and inflationary universes .",
    "we consider a situation in which our universe started expanding linearly @xcite since its very beginning at a rate @xmath40 with @xmath41 at the point of singularity .",
    "thus at a later time @xmath42 , the observable @xmath43 would be determined by the relation , @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 is the present value of @xmath46 divided by the age of the universe . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ meq ] ) reduces to @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "solution set for the differential equation  ( [ lineq ] ) in connection to different physical parameters is given below , @xmath49 here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are integration constants and @xmath52 reads as @xmath53/4.\\ ] ] with the fact that @xmath54 , we may neglect the term involving @xmath55 in the above equation , which would yield @xmath56 .",
    "however , this would amount to be neglecting r.h.s term , @xmath57 , of equation  ( [ lineq ] ) , which suggests that the effect of this term is small .",
    "it is also obvious from equation  ( [ lineq ] ) that this term matters only at an early stage of the evolution of the universe where @xmath58 .",
    "however , at this regime quantum effects become important and hence are of no relevance in our general relativistic approach .    with the consideration , @xmath59 , equation  ( [ omegaq ] ) does not involve any explicit time dependence .",
    "so is equation  ( [ wc ] ) provided @xmath60 .",
    "we notice that with @xmath61 and integration constants @xmath60 and @xmath62 , equation  ( [ ac ] ) becomes a perfect example of a linearly expanding robertson - walker universe , @xmath63 .",
    "however , @xmath61 suggests a value @xmath64 , which is well above the minimum limit of @xmath3 i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "we would see it later that inflation scales it to a lower value . from equation  ( [ hc ] ) ,",
    "deceleration parameter , @xmath66 , is deduced to be @xmath67 , which thus is zero for such a linearly expanding universe .",
    "the upper panel represents @xmath68 . in this panel ,",
    "dotted , dashed , long - dashed , and chain curves correspond to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . in the lower panel representing @xmath71 ,",
    "same curves correspond to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . the solid , thick dashed and thick long - dashed lines represent @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "for all these @xmath76 is taken to be @xmath77 . ]",
    "the dotted , dashed , long - dashed , chain and solid curves represent @xmath78 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the thick dashed and thick long - dashed lines represent @xmath79 and -0.6 , respectively .",
    "for all these , @xmath80 is adjusted using @xmath81     the scale factors for the curves shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . ]",
    "we now consider a physical situation in which our universe initially inflated non - linearly up to a certain value of time @xmath82 second @xcite . since this time onward",
    "the expansion of the universe is assumed to be quite linear , which is described by the rate @xmath83 .",
    "here @xmath84 is the measure of the time from @xmath85 .",
    "this leads to a translation in @xmath46 such that @xmath86 .",
    "we assume that inflation has led to a condition @xmath87 , which implies that @xmath88 . with the consideration that the period of inflation has been very very brief compared to the age of the universe",
    ", we may write @xmath89 and @xmath90 . however , the value of @xmath91 would be different from the previous case of linearly expanding universe . under these conditions ,",
    "equation  ( [ meq ] ) reduces to @xmath92 if we substitute @xmath93 at the place of @xmath76 in equation  ( [ lineq ] ) , we arrive at equation  ( [ infeq ] ) .",
    "the solution set obtained for the linearly expanding universe is still valid for the inflationary universe provided we substitute @xmath76 at the place of @xmath93 in equation  ( [ ee ] ) .",
    "this scaling from @xmath93 to @xmath76 in equation  ( [ ee ] ) may be attributed to the adiabatic expansion of the universe till time @xmath94 . the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ infeq ] )",
    "may be always neglected in this case because @xmath46 is evolved to a large value compared to the values of @xmath55 during inflation .    with the consideration that @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the value @xmath97 as obtained for linearly expanding universe now corresponds to @xmath98 for an inflationary universe .",
    "therefore , the values @xmath96 and @xmath99 correspond to previously discussed linearly expanding universe and a nonzero value for @xmath80 represents inflationary universe .",
    "thus , we notice a direct correlation between @xmath3 and the inflation of the robertson - walker universe , which is buried in the value of the parameter @xmath80 . with @xmath96 , the range of the values",
    "@xmath100 falls in the suggested range @xmath101 .    we may invoke a time dependence in equation  ( [ wc ] ) through @xmath51",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , data do not suggest any significant explicit time dependence in @xmath3 , thus @xmath51 is set to zero .",
    "the non - linearity in @xmath102 may be invoked through @xmath76 in @xmath52 by choosing a different value for it other than @xmath77 .",
    "thus for a linear behaviour after inflation this value is fixed to @xmath77 .",
    "the equation  ( [ rhoc ] ) for @xmath5 is singular at @xmath103 .",
    "so is equation  ( [ pc ] ) for @xmath4 , which has been plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] . for the negative pressure ,",
    "as required by the dark energy , it applies a constraint on @xmath3 such that @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "we find a range @xmath106 with @xmath96 .",
    "we have discussed two universes : ( i ) a linearly expanding universe from its very beginning , ( ii ) and also the universe like ours , which has gone through an inflation at its very early stage followed by a linear expansion later .",
    "we notice that these two kind of universes , which are direct consequence of our proposition ( equation  [ omegaq ] ) , are represented by the same set of equations with a translational shift in the equation of state parameter in the latter case compared to the former . in both the cases , @xmath107 demands @xmath61 , which applies a constraint on the equation of state parameter . for the inflationary universe ,",
    "we have pin pointed @xmath96 and have delineated the other parameter with a range @xmath108 .",
    "we observe that former is a special case of the latter with @xmath96 and @xmath80=0 .",
    "any other value of @xmath76 would invoke a non - linear behaviour in @xmath102 through @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of the variation of @xmath76 on @xmath4 is presented in figure  [ fig2 ] for a constant @xmath109 obtained by adjusting @xmath80 accordingly .",
    "the @xmath80 has nothing to do with @xmath52 and hence has nothing to do with @xmath102 .",
    "however , its value is a measure of translation in @xmath6 due to inflation .",
    "the equations for @xmath5 and @xmath4 involve @xmath6 and hence would remain unchanged with its constant value .",
    "thus , variations in curves of figure  [ fig2 ] is purely due to the variation in @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding variations in @xmath102 are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .    a negligible value of @xmath55 is shown to be physically possible from the viewpoint of cosmology and particle physics , which means the absence of @xmath1 in the field equations .",
    "so , both from physical and mathematical point of view the nullity of @xmath1 is achieved for the same @xmath1 model .",
    "again , the expression of @xmath66 in this case has a striking similarity with that of  @xcite .",
    "this work suggests that in the late phase of the universe , where @xmath110 , the equation of state parameter behaves as a constant . perhaps for this reason current data can not distinguish clearly between a time - dependent @xmath6 and a constant one as pointed out by some workers @xcite .    separating the entire cosmic history into two phases , it has been possible to derive the time - dependent expressions for the scale factor and the other physical parameters of each phase .",
    "it has been found that for inflationary phase , the deceleration parameter @xmath66 depends on time whereas for the linearly expanding phase it is constant , rather zero .",
    "this supports the opinion that @xmath66 has changed during the course of time  @xcite .",
