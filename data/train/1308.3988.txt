    "spin liquids are disordered states in correlated spin systems , in which strong quantum fluctuations prevent from the formation of conventional spin orders related with spontaneous symmetry breaking.@xcite such spin liquid states are common in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems owing to the low coordinate number and strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , for the systems beyond 1d , the correlated spins favor to freeze into solid at low temperatures .",

    "it is worthy to mention that the finite - size husimi cactus , which has roughly as many sites on the boundary as in the bulk , can be exactly solved because the haf model in this case is frustration - free,@xcite and no spin liquid solution on husimi cactus was found owing to a heavy boundary effect.@xcite here we utilize the iterative approaches , i.e , tensor - network - based numerical simulations , to study the ground - state and thermodynamic properties of the haf model with high accuracy .",

    "<S> by utilizing the tensor - network - based methods , we investigate the zero- and finite - temperature properties of the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( haf ) model on an infinite husimi lattice that contains 3/2 sites per triangle . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of this model is found to possess vanishing local magnetization and is featureless ; the spin - spin and dimer - dimer correlation functions are verified to decay exponentially ; and its ground - state energy per site is determined to be @xmath0 , which is very close to that [ @xmath1 of the intriguing kagome haf model . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization curve shows the absence of a zero - magnetization plateau , implying a gapless excitation . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath2-magnetization plateau with spin up - up - down state is observed , which is selected and stabilized by quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> a ground state phase diagram under magnetic fields is presented . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , both magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied , whose low - temperature behaviors reinforce the conclusion that the haf model on the infinite husimi lattice owns a gapless and featureless spin liquid ground state . </S>"
