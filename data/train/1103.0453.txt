    "<S> the radiative capture @xmath0 is the only process that produces @xmath9 in the big bang model . </S>",
    "<S> a special interest to this reaction has been trigerred by almost three order disagreemnet between the observational ratio @xmath10 @xcite and the calculated one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately direct measurements of the @xmath0 radiative capture are practically impossible at astrophysically relevant @xmath5 relative kinetic energies @xmath11 kev due to extremely low cross section . </S>",
    "<S> hence , only indirect approach could be feasible to get information about @xmath9 formation . </S>",
    "<S> the first indirect information about the astrophysical factor @xmath4 for the @xmath0 process has been obtained in @xcite from the coulomb breakup process @xmath12 . however , the energy behavior of the extracted astrophysical factor at low energies turned out to be constant what contradicted to all the calculations showing significant drop @xcite . recently in @xcite a new attempt has been done to get the astrophysical factor @xmath4 at astrophysically relevant energies from @xmath13 . however , analysis has shown significant dominance of the nuclear breakup over the coulomb one making impossible to determine the needed information about @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in @xcite the @xmath4 has been calculated using the @xmath5 two - body potential model . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials which are required to make such calculations were obtained from fitting the @xmath5 elastic scattering phase shift for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 waves . </S>",
    "<S> the approach used to calculate the astrophysical factor is not related with the studied @xmath9 breakup process . </S>",
    "<S> the only common information in the analysis of the breakup data and calculation of the astrophysical factor were the same bound state and scattering @xmath5 potentials used to generate the corresponding bound state and scattering wave functions . in the potential approach used in @xcite the bound state potential , as we will discuss below , </S>",
    "<S> is the most crucial part of the input , which affects the overall normalization of the astrophysical factor . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the dominance of the nuclear breakup and dependence of the breakup data analysis on the optical potentials does nt allow one to make a test of the quality of the adopted @xmath5 potential . </S>",
    "<S> the approach applied in @xcite is just repetition of the procedure used in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we would like to discuss how reliable are the astrophysical factor @xmath4 and the reaction rates for the @xmath0 radiative capture reported in @xcite and what should be done to improve our knowledge about them . </S>",
    "<S> it has been long ago recognized that the @xmath0 process at astrophysical energies is entirely peripheral reaction in the two - body potential model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the potential model itself is a limitation and it would be nice to check peripherality of this reaction within a many - body ab initio approach similat to what has been done recently for the @xmath16 in @xcite . however , an important issue in a many - body approach remains to be solved is reproduction of the experimental binding energy , because the calculated astrophysical factor is sensitive to its value . since such ab initio many - body calculations are not yet available we have to live with a more simple two - body potential model </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element for the @xmath0 direct radiative capture in the long - wave approximation is given by @xcite @xmath17 all the notations are given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off radius @xmath18 is introduced to reflect a peripheral character of the process . </S>",
    "<S> the multipolarity of the transition is @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in @xcite that the matrix element shows a very small sensitivity for @xmath20 fm , i.e. until distances which exceeds the @xmath9 radius and makes possible to approximate the radial overlap function by the @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) for the virtual decay @xmath6 in the state with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath23 and the total angular momentum @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the whittaker function determining the radial shape of the overlap function beyond of the @xmath5 nuclear interaction region , @xmath26 is the coulomb @xmath5 bound state parameter , @xmath27 is the @xmath5 bound state wave number , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the reduced mass and binding energy of @xmath30 and @xmath15 , correspondingly . as we can see , there are two inputs needed to calculate the matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> one is the @xmath5 potential describing the continuum in the partial waves @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this potential has been found in cite @xcite by fitting the elastic scattering phase shifts in these partial waves and it is a legitimate procedure . note that at very low energies , say around the most effective energy of @xmath32 kev , one can use a pure coulomb scattering wave function in the initial state of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the role of nuclear interaction becomes very important with energy increase and it is responsible for reproduction of the resonance at @xmath33 mev . in the potential approach used in @xcite the overlap function </S>",
    "<S> is replaced by the @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the spectroscopic factor for the configuration @xmath36 in @xmath9 , @xmath37 is the radial wave function of the @xmath5 relative motion in the field generated by the woods - saxon potential . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath38 is the principal quantum number , i.e. the number of the nodes for @xmath39 is @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic factor reflects the fact that the overlap function is not an eigenfunction of any hamiltonian and , hence , is not normalized to unity in contrast to the bound state wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the potential , which is used to calculate the bound state wave function , has been determined in @xcite from the fitting to the @xmath5 elastic scattering phase shift in the channel @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> since the experimental elastic scattering phase shift includes the many - body effects of the scattered nuclei , the same is true for the two - body potential which fits the elastic scattering data . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the spectroscopic factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ singlpart1 ] ) should be set to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> it is exactly what has been done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the reaction under consideration is peripheral at astrophysical energies @xmath11 kev , functions in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ singlpart1 ] ) can be replaced by their tales , i.e. @xmath44 i.e. in the two - body potential model in the asymptotic region @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the single - particle anc for the @xmath5 bound state with the number of nodes for @xmath47 @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the single - particle anc depends on the adopted bound - state potential . from the parameters of the bound state potential given in @xcite we find that @xmath49 @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus from the woods - saxon potential given in @xcite we get the anc , which is about @xmath51 larger then the anc used in @xcite . since the astrophysical factor is proportional to the square of the anc the usage of @xmath52 @xmath53 rather than @xmath54 @xmath53 leads to the increase of the astrophysical factor compared to the one obtained in @xcite by almost @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 9 @xcite , where both astrophysical factors are shown in the logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> we came to the main point of this paper , the anc , which is the most crucial input in the calculation of the @xmath4 . in @xcite , as in @xcite , the @xmath7-wave scattering phase shift has been used to determine the bound - state potential , which generates the bound state wave function and , correspondingly , the anc . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known from the inverse scattering problem that there is infinite number of the phase - equivalent potentials and to single out a unique potential one has to add two parameters ( if only one bound state is present in the given partial wave ) : the binding energy and the anc . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the adopted potential reproduces experimental @xmath5 binding energy but still , one parameter , the anc is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the potential found in @xcite is one out of an infinite set of the phase equivalent potentials and the anc , which it generates , is not necessarily a correct one . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is another way of using the elastic scattering data which has been realized in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the analiticity of the elastic scattering @xmath55-matrix element what allows one to extrapolation the experimental scattering amplitude to the bound state pole in the momentum plane to get the residue , which is expressed in terms of the anc . once the anc has been determined a unique potential </S>",
    "<S> can be found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this potential has to satisfy the condition @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bound state wave number . </S>",
    "<S> these procedures had been realized in @xcite for the @xmath5 @xmath58-wave elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> first , the pade approximation was used to interpolate the elastic scattering amplitude in the physical region , which was extrapolated to the bound state pole to get the anc . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained anc @xmath59 @xmath50 is lower than @xmath60 @xmath50 following from the potential used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after that the two - body potential has been found , which reproduces the @xmath7-wave @xmath5 phase shift and provides correct binding energy and the same anc . </S>",
    "<S> the found potential is more complicated than a woods - saxon one . </S>",
    "<S> it is a complex , energy independent potential , which can be expanded in terms of the harmonic oscillator basis . evidently , that such a potential satisfies condition ( [ potentialcond1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ambiguity in the two - body potential calls for more thorough selection of the potential because eventually the adopted potential for the bound state will determine the overall normalization of the astrophysical factor for peripheral direct radiative capture processes .    </S>",
    "<S> if we would confine ourselves to astrophysical energies then it would be enough to replace in the matrix element ( [ matrelement1 ] ) the overlap function by its asymptotic term ( [ asympt1 ] ) and , evidently , the astrophysical factor will be proportional to @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we want to extend our calculations to higher energies including the resonance region and above we need to carry more accurate calculations . to compare our results with the @xmath4 factor presented in @xcite we adopt the same @xmath5 scattering potential as in @xcite . for the @xmath5 bound state potential </S>",
    "<S> it would be logically reasonable to use the bound state potential from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since it has quite complicated form , we simply modify the bound state potential used in @xcite using the theorem of the inverse problem in scattering theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this theorem allows one to recover a phase equivalent potential to the woods - saxon potential used in @xcite with arbitrary anc . </S>",
    "<S> assume that we find a nuclear potential @xmath62 , which together with the added coulomb potential @xmath63 fits the elastic scattering phase shift in the @xmath23 partial wave and the bound state wave function calculated with this potential has the anc @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> then the phase - equivalent potential is given by @xmath65 @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{kr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bound state wave function in the potential @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of the bound state wave function @xmath68 in the potential @xmath69 : @xmath70 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ varphi11 ] ) taking the limit @xmath71 we obtain that @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath73 be the nuclear woods - saxon plus coulomb bound - state @xmath5 potential adopted in @xcite , which generates the bound - state wave function with @xmath74 @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> then for @xmath75 we obtain the wave function in the potential @xmath76 , which has the same anc as obtained in @xcite and used in @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_vn ] both nuclear potentials are shown . </S>",
    "<S> since the difference between the potentials is very small , panel ( a ) , in panel ( b ) we show the tails of both potentials in the scale allowing to see the difference .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the existence of the potential @xmath77 , which is the phase equivalent to the bound state potential found in @xcite with the same anc , does nt contradict to the inverse scattering theorem because the addition @xmath78 to the potential @xmath62 asymptotically decays as @xmath79 violating condition ( [ potentialcond1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it does nt allow one to use potential @xmath77 for analytical extrapolation of the scattering amplitude generated by this potential to the bound state pole but we need this potential here only to generate the bound state wave function with correct amplitude of the tail , i.e. the anc .    using the bound state wave functions generated by the potentials @xmath62 and @xmath77 and the scattering @xmath5 wave functions in the partial waves @xmath80 , we calculated the @xmath4 for the radiative capture @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sfactor ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the astrophysical factor with the bound state wave function generated by the potential @xmath81 is the @xmath4 presented in @xcite while our @xmath4 is the one obtained using the bound state wave function generated by @xmath76 . at energies below the resonance practically the tails of the bound states </S>",
    "<S> wave functions do contribute to the matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> since the square of the anc in @xcite is higher than our one by @xmath8 , correspondingly the astrophysical factor from @xcite is systematically higher than our @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations , definitely better reproduce the experimental data @xcite at energies larger than the resonance energies , where the calculations from @xcite clearly overestimate the data . at resonance energies </S>",
    "<S> both calculations reproduce the data @xcite very well . at astrophysically relevant energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 kev our @xmath4 is lower than the one from @xcite by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> finaly in table [ table_rates ] we present the @xmath0 reaction rates , which are also systematically lower than those presented in @xcite .    .    </S>",
    "<S> .the rate for @xmath0 reaction calculated using our astrophysical s - factor for the temperature range @xmath82.[table_rates ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this work we have demonstrated that a crucial quantity , which is necessary to pinpoint the @xmath4 astrophysical factor , is the anc for the virtual decay @xmath83 . due to </S>",
    "<S> the peripheral character of the @xmath0 direct radiative capture , this anc determines the overall normalizatiion of the astrophysical factor at astrophysically relevant energies . from our calculations and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_sfactor ] we can see that at low energies the contribution from the isospin forbidden @xmath84 transition dominates over the allowed @xmath85 transition . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath86 kev , which is the most effective energy , the contribution from the @xmath84 transition to the total @xmath4 astrophysical factor is about @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> even at @xmath88 kev the @xmath84 transition contributes about @xmath89 to the total astrophysical factor . </S>",
    "<S> meantime , even if the coulomb breakup of @xmath9 would dominate , at @xmath86 kev the @xmath84 transition will be suppressed compared to the @xmath85 by a factor of @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> it can hardly make possible to determine the total astrophysical factor from the @xmath9 experiment . since the anc is the only crucial information needed to calculate the @xmath4 astrophysical factor at astrophysical energies , we call for more accurate measurements of the @xmath7-wave @xmath5 elastic scattering phase shift at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> it will help to extrapolate more accurately the data to the bound state pole to get more anc for @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the problem of determination of the two - body bound state potential from the elastic scattering phase shift is quite important in different applications of nuclear reaction theory , in particular , in faddeev approach for reactions with composite particles . </S>"
