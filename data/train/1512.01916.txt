    "for the past @xmath5 years there have been various efforts to model the processes that govern the volatility of financial assets .",
    "the interest comes , to a large extent , from the role that the volatility parameter plays in the black and scholes theory .",
    "even when in its original form black - scholes model fails to account for relevant observed effects , such as the smile , the study of the evolution of the volatility process has only gained relevance over time .",
    "the reason for this is that doing away with the assumption that the parameter is constant and adding a stochastic component to it helps in the understanding of the smile effect . in all fairness",
    ", it is hard to make the case for a constant volatility of asset prices .",
    "a crucial step towards modeling volatilities is the identification of stylized facts that we would like our model to accommodate .",
    "two of the most important stylized facts are clustering and the leverage effect .",
    "clustering refers to the fact that volatility tends to persist : high ( low ) volatility periods tend to be followed by high ( low ) volatility periods .",
    "the leverage effect , on the other hand , refers to the asymmetry with which volatility moves in reaction to positive returns as opposed to negative returns .    among the models that try to deal with the volatility by adding stochasticity we can differentiate between two different types : the arch - garch family of models and the stochastic volatility models .",
    "the former follows the ideas that originated in the time series literature .",
    "the autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic ( arch ) model was introduced by engle @xcite in @xmath6 and a lot of modifications of it have been studied ever since , examples of those modifications are the garch@xmath7 , igarch ( integrated ) , egarch ( exponential ) , qarch ( quadratic ) and tgarch ( threshold ) models . even in both arch and garch models",
    "the return effects are in a symmetric fashion , some of their refinements mentioned building in the capability of accounting for the leverage effect .",
    "in a recent paper , chicheportiche and bouchaud @xcite present a thorough study of the quadratic arch model originally due to sentana @xcite",
    ". its most general form reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the return defined as @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the price of an asset at time @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the conditional variance of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are some kernels that characterize how the past returns affect the conditional variance . by calibrating the model with us stock returns , chicheportiche and bouchaud found that the feedback kernels exhibit some unexpected features .",
    "one of their central results is that the off - diagonal terms of the quadratic kernel , namely @xmath15 with @xmath16 , while being significant , is one order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , the off - diagonal terms are found to be negative for large lags .",
    "they also found @xmath17 decays as a power - law of the lag , in the line with the long - memory of volatility , and @xmath14 has two time scales as shown by their two - exponential fit .",
    "they argued that the observed complex structure in the kernels is surprising and incompatible with the models proposed so far .",
    "we will see later that , indeed , our model may provide a simple interpretation of those features .    in arch - garch family of models ,",
    "the central object to model is the conditional volatility @xmath18 .",
    "after the dynamics of @xmath18 is specified such as eq .",
    ", the instantaneous return is constructed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is independently drawn from a prescribed distribution with zero mean and variance equal to one ( e.g.,standard normal distribution ) .",
    "the dynamic of @xmath18 has been specified by a large variety of models in many different ways .",
    "a common way is to model how conditional variance @xmath13 depends on the quantities like @xmath21 or @xmath22 in the past .",
    "however , people also model conditional volatility @xmath18 directly or more generally @xmath23 . for a review of those models and",
    "how they are compared to the simple garch(1,1 ) , we refer the interested readers to the paper by hansen and lunde @xcite . in this paper , a slightly different approach is adopted to model financial time series .",
    "we start with a general assumption that the @xmath18 depends on the past returns @xmath24 , which it is the assumption that all arch - like models are based on , then assume that the feedback from the past returns to the current volatility is  small \" and work in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "we seek the simplest model in our framework that can capture the stylized facts of the data , namely clustered volatility and leverage effect .",
    "the specific model we found turns out to be very similar to tgarch model studied by zakoian@xcite , however as shown later , instead of performing careful statistical tests of models as most studies on tgarch model did , we focus on looking for qualitative features that model parameters exhibit when the model is calibrated with data . in this way",
    ", we hope our analysis may provide some useful insights about the stock market .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the general assumptions and guidelines that lead to our asymmetric volatility model .",
    "its relation to other models is briefly mentioned .",
    "section 3 defines various correlation functions and their leading order expressions are calculated within our model .",
    "section 4 performs an empirical study under the stationary assumption , i.e. , assuming the model parameters are constant during the whole period .",
    "the features of the model parameters are discussed .",
    "section 5 relaxes the stationary assumption to show how those parameters change with time and the nontrivial patterns in time evolution are found .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes our findings and concludes the paper .",
    "we propose in this section the asymmetric volatility model based on some general assumptions .",
    "the return of a stock at time @xmath12 is defined as usual @xmath25 , where @xmath11 is the price of a stock .",
    "the @xmath9 is a random variable and can be written in a form of @xmath26 .",
    "we regard both @xmath27 and @xmath20 are random .",
    "@xmath20 is independent of the past with the conditions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 denotes the unconditional expectation value .",
    "if the @xmath27 is deterministic after conditioning on all past information up to @xmath12 , then the model is much like arch - garch models ; if @xmath27 is still random even when all past information is given , then the model belongs to a stochastic volatility model .",
    "we further assume the unconditional expectation @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a deterministic function of time @xmath12 , independent of the past return @xmath21 .",
    "we expect @xmath32 is a slow - varying and well - behaved function of @xmath12 since the stochasticity or irregularity of @xmath27 has been  averaged \" out .",
    "one notices that @xmath32 , being an expectation value , is not directly observed , since one can not distinguish which part of the observed fluctuation of the return @xmath9 is due to @xmath27 and which part is due to @xmath20 , so we can not have observations of only @xmath27 at each time , we only know @xmath9 which is the product of two random variables @xmath27 and @xmath20 . in a summary , we can write a general expression of a stock return as follows . @xmath33 where @xmath34 is kronecker s delta function .",
    "eq . , valid in both arch - like and stochastic volatility models , is our starting point .",
    "if the volatility is deterministic and constant , @xmath35 , and @xmath20 follows standard normal distribution , we get back the brownian motion model .",
    "to take into account the clustered volatility , the randomness is introduced to the volatility @xmath27 .",
    "we follow the approach of arch - garch models and assume that the randomness is all from the past returns .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath27 as a deterministic function of past returns . @xmath36    the generalized function @xmath37 encapsulates all possible complex dependence on the past returns .",
    "because of this past dependence , the volatility at different time becomes correlated , which results in clustered volatility .",
    "some general properties of the return @xmath9 immediately follow from eq . and .",
    "for example , with @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 means conditioning on information available before time @xmath12 or information up to time @xmath41 . as a consequence ,",
    "the returns at different time are still uncorrelated . working in a similar way ,",
    "we see that the observed volatility @xmath42 is larger than @xmath32 ( note @xmath43 by eq . ) , @xmath44 by introducing the randomness to the volatility , the observed volatility increases .",
    "we next consider the specific form of @xmath45 with the constraint @xmath43 .",
    "we further assume the stationary condition , namely @xmath46 is constant and @xmath45 does not explicitly depend on time @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath45 is a linear function of past returns , @xmath47    then it actually belongs to one kind of qarch model .",
    "indeed , we can calculate the conditional expectation @xmath48 , @xmath49 comparing with eq .",
    ", we see the above linear model belongs to qarch type models with kernels @xmath50 and @xmath51 . this example shows the simple form of our function @xmath45 may lead to a more complicated structure of the conditional variance which plays a central role for many arch - garch models .",
    "as indicated by leverage effect , the current volatility depends differently on whether the past returns are positive or negative . instead of the linear function eq .",
    ", it is more reasonable to propose the asymmetric volatility feedback as follows .",
    "@xmath52 \\cdot \\epsilon(t ) \\\\",
    "j(\\{r(t-\\tau),\\tau > 0\\ } ) & = \\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{\\infty } k_{+}(\\tau ) ( r_{+}(t-\\tau)- { \\text{e}\\,}r_{+ } ) + \\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{\\infty } k_{-}(\\tau ) ( r_{-}(t-\\tau)- { \\text{e}\\,}r_{- } ) \\end{split } \\label{eqkpm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 is an indicator function , @xmath56 if the event @xmath30 is true and @xmath57 otherwise .",
    "@xmath58 , are constants by the stationary assumption . for simplicity , we assume @xmath20 is drawn from the standard normal distribution , although other distributions with fat tails can be considered .",
    "if @xmath59 , then the above nonlinear model reduces to the linear case eq .. the @xmath27 is deterministic when the past history and @xmath60 are given . from the general properties , we have @xmath61 @xmath62 is the observed variance .",
    "@xmath45 in eq . can be viewed as a first order expansion with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath64 around @xmath65 and @xmath66 . by using @xmath67 and @xmath68 ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath45 as @xmath69    @xmath70 characterizes the effect on the current volatility from the magnitude of the return at @xmath71 units of time ago .",
    "it is very similar to the arch model where the conditional volatility depends on the absolute value of the past returns .",
    "@xmath72 gives @xmath45 the dependence of the sign of the past returns , which provides the asymmetric behavior .",
    "we notice that if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath45 only depends on the absolute value of past returns .",
    "similar terms like @xmath72 are also included in some garch - like models to take into account the leverage effect .",
    "however , if one treats @xmath75 and @xmath76 as independent variables , both clustered volatility and leverage effect arise naturally .    let us further comment on the relationship between our model and existing volatility models .",
    "our model starting from @xmath18 instead of the variance @xmath77 is very similar to the volatility models studied by taylor@xcite , schwert@xcite and zakoian@xcite . among them , tgarch model studied by zakoian@xcite is the closest one . in his paper , he performed a careful statistical test on a specific model called tarch(5 ) and argued that the different effect between positive and negative past returns is significant .",
    "the model written in our notation is @xmath78 which is equivalent ( up to a constant ) to our model truncated at @xmath79 . instead of thorough statistical tests on the model ,",
    "we proceed in a different way to study the model and calibrate it with the data .",
    "we do not constrain the model to some small lags , but instead allow it to be large and see what patterns of model parameters like @xmath80 appear when the model is compared to the data .",
    "we hope our method will reveal new aspects about the asymmetric arch model and provide useful insights of the volatility process .",
    "in order to calibrate the model and obtain the information about parameters @xmath60 , we define various correlation functions as  observables \" that can be derived from the data , then compute them within our model in terms of @xmath60 .",
    "we study the following observables .",
    "@xmath81    under the stationary assumption , the above functions are independent of time @xmath12 and only depend on @xmath71 .",
    "the observable @xmath82 , up to a normalization factor , was first proposed by bouchaud , matacz and potters@xcite to study the leverage effect .",
    "the leverage effect is characterized by the following properties of @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 this asymmetry in time is a built - in feature in our framework , since the current volatility depends on past returns not future .    to further explore the consequences of our model eq . , we need to evaluate the correlation functions defined in eq .. the expression @xmath45 in eq .",
    "can be regarded as the first order taylor expansion of @xmath85 and expect @xmath60 to be small in some sense , for example , @xmath86 . in calculating the correlation functions",
    ", we only keep the first order of @xmath60 . due to the smallness of both @xmath60 and @xmath9 ,",
    "higher order corrections are expected to be suppressed .",
    "we will discuss later whether the first order calculation is reasonable by retrospecting the results obtained . in the leading order of @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath87 can be expressed as @xmath88 note the expectation values in parenthesis are multiplied by @xmath60 . to calculate @xmath87 in leading order",
    ", we can use @xmath89 in evaluating those expectation values , any deviations from this result are in higher orders of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we have used @xmath20 is drawn independently from the standard normal distribution .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are used .",
    "we have the expression for @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath96 \\label{l+}\\ ] ]    similarly for @xmath97 , @xmath98 \\label{l-}\\ ] ]    the overall scale of @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 .",
    "we can approximate @xmath101 with the observed variance @xmath102 in the first order since @xmath103 and any corrections come from the second order .",
    "the different weighting values ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) in eq . and",
    "introduce the asymmetry between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "having obtained @xmath99 , we have the expression for the leverage function . @xmath108",
    "the leverage function @xmath83 ( up to a factor @xmath109 ) was first studied in the paper@xcite .",
    "the authors argue that if the current price is determined by some average of the past prices and assume the volatility is proportional to the current price , then one obtains a universal relationship @xmath110 . in our model",
    ", this is true only when @xmath111 . in the viewpoint of our model ,",
    "the universal constant @xmath112 means the scale of the parameter @xmath72 with small @xmath71 is set by @xmath113 .",
    "this scale is quite understandable since one expects the leverage effect is more significant when there is a large downward move in the market which induces a large volatility .",
    "thus , @xmath72 is likely to scale with @xmath114 .",
    "we do not further assume any postulated properties about @xmath72 or @xmath115 and @xmath116 , instead @xmath60 are derived from the observables @xmath99 by eq . and .",
    "@xmath117    the above equations completely fix our model parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then they can be used to calculate other observables and compare with the data . in this way",
    ", we can have a consistency check of our model as well as leading order calculation .",
    "let s calculate @xmath118 that is usually used to illustrate the volatility clustering .",
    "@xmath119\\\\ & = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\sigma_0 ^ 4(k_{+}(\\tau)-k_{-}(\\tau ) ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath120    we have seen from eq . and",
    "eq . that @xmath72 and @xmath70 are indeed responsible for the leverage effect and clustered volatility respectively",
    ".    we can calculate the even moments of the return @xmath9 , which provides another aspect to check our model and the first order calculation .",
    "define the normalized even moment function @xmath121 as follows .",
    "@xmath122    in the gaussian case , namely @xmath89 , the expression of @xmath121 is easily obtained .",
    "@xmath123    to calculate @xmath121 in the leading nonzero order of @xmath60 , we first evaluate @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125\\\\ & = \\sigma_0 ^ 2\\cdot \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{\\pi } ) \\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{\\infty}\\left(k_+(\\tau ) + k_-(\\tau)\\right)^2+(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-1 ) \\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{\\infty } k_+(\\tau ) k_-(\\tau ) \\right]\\\\ & = \\sigma_0 ^ 2 ( 1+\\delta(k ) ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the leading nonzero correction to the @xmath124 , or @xmath127 .",
    "now , let s calculate @xmath128 for even @xmath129 in the leading nonzero order of @xmath130 , or equivalently , in the leading order of @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 therefore , keep the first order of @xmath131 in @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath133    we have worked out the observables @xmath99 , @xmath134 and @xmath121 in terms of functions @xmath60 at the leading order .",
    "the simple leading order results allow us to easily calibrate our model and interpret the data .",
    "to perform an empirical study of the model , we analyze daily closing prices of the 30 stocks forming the dow jones industrial average over 77 years from 15 march 1939 until 16 october 2015 .",
    "there are jumps in those stocks prices such as stock splits , bonus issues , dividends payouts and replacements of index components .",
    "we simply discard those points by setting the return zero if the price jumps by more than @xmath135 in one day .",
    "this regularization condition should not introduce much bias in our analysis , since they take up only @xmath136 of our total 19800 data points for one stock .",
    "we also change this cutoff in a range @xmath137 , our conclusion remains the same . for this section ,",
    "we work under the stationary assumption and assume function @xmath138 only depends on the time lag @xmath71 .",
    "we will relax the stationary assumption and study how @xmath139 change with time in the next section .",
    "the time average of data in the whole period is used to estimate the different expectation values defined in the previous section .",
    "the stationary assumption across 77 years is certainly over - simplified , however we expect the qualitative behavior of functions @xmath139 do not change much . in this section",
    ", we will focus on how @xmath140 depends on @xmath71 and check our simple model against dow jones data .",
    "fig.1 shows @xmath141 for different stocks .",
    "we choose the 4 stocks with ticker symbols dd , ge , pg and utx since they are only stocks remaining in dow jones industrial average for the whole period under studied .",
    "we notice 3 major features of the conditional correlation functions @xmath99 .",
    "first , @xmath142 , especially for large @xmath71 .",
    "this fact shows @xmath143 , which means @xmath144 .",
    "the volatility feedback largely depends on the magnitude of the past returns not linearly on the returns itself .",
    "the leverage effect is small as compared to the correlation on volatility .",
    "second , @xmath107 and @xmath106 indeed behave differently at small @xmath71 . for example , @xmath145 and @xmath107 decays slightly faster than @xmath106 does .",
    "this remarkable difference at short time scale is the evidence that the leverage effect although being small is significant and operating strongly at short time .",
    "third , @xmath141 are different for different stocks .",
    "for some stocks like ge and utx , the correlation functions decay faster than the correlation functions of other stocks like pg and dd",
    ". this difference may be due to the fact that stocks are from different sectors .",
    "given @xmath99 , we can obtain @xmath60 by eq .. we choose utx as an example to study the functions @xmath60 in detail since @xmath99 of utx is relatively small so that the result from the first order calculation is more reliable .",
    "fig.2 illustrates the behaviors of function @xmath60 . to account both fast and slow decays of correlation functions ,",
    "we propose the exponential truncated power - law fitting functions for @xmath60 as follows .",
    "@xmath146 when @xmath147 , it is an exponential decay which is more suitable for fitting a stock like ge ; when @xmath148 or @xmath149 ( @xmath150 in our case ) , it is a power - law decay which works for a stock like pg .",
    "the fitted functions for utx are ( with @xmath151 confidence bounds ) @xmath152    the fitting parameters @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 illustrate the different behaviors of @xmath60 quantitatively .",
    "we have seen that @xmath156 and @xmath157 while @xmath158 .",
    "@xmath156 shows the feedback to the current volatility is stronger when the past returns are negative .",
    "the contribution of @xmath159 to the function @xmath140 is through the factor @xmath160 . for small @xmath71 ,",
    "the value of @xmath160 is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath159 .",
    "the parameter @xmath159 characterizes the feedback effect at short time scale .",
    "the larger the @xmath159 is , the faster @xmath161 drops .",
    "the parameter @xmath162 gives us the long - term time scale of the correlation .",
    "this long term correlation is well known and results in the clustered volatility , which has a similar time scale for both feedback functions @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we have two time scales on the feedback effect of volatility . to estimate the two time scales , we can alternatively fit @xmath140 with two exponential functions .",
    "@xmath163 we see that for utx the short time scale is about 10 days while the long time scale is 200 days .",
    "doing similar two exponential fitting to other stocks yields the short time scale is typically @xmath164 days while the long time scale can be @xmath165 days .",
    "the two time scales are consistent with the two time scales found in chicheportiche and bouchaud s study of the qarch models@xcite .    to further understand the features of quadratic kernel in qarch model , we square eq ..",
    "@xmath166    the terms omitted are constant terms , linear terms in @xmath21 or @xmath167 , and quadratic terms like @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "if one instead assumes a qarch model eq . , the correlation functions or generalized moments such as @xmath170 or @xmath171 will be used to calibrate the qarch model .",
    "this is very similar to the way the qarch model was calibrated in the paper@xcite , where the combined generalized moment methods(gmm ) and maximum likelihood estimation(mle ) were used .",
    "however , if one assumes our model eq .",
    ", in the leading order of @xmath60 , only two terms appear in eq",
    ". will contribute to @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , we have an estimate of quadratic kernel in our model as @xmath172 with the help of above equation , the features of the @xmath15 can be understood in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath72 . because @xmath173 , the diagonal terms in the quadratic kernel of qarch model are larger than its off - diagonal terms .",
    "this because the @xmath18 largely depends on @xmath167 not @xmath21 itself , and the contribution of @xmath167 can enter into the diagonal elements of @xmath15 but not its off - diagonal terms .",
    "it also can be understood that off - diagonal terms may become negative for large lag @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , @xmath174 for a large @xmath71 and @xmath175 , so the signs of @xmath72 and @xmath176 can well be opposite , which renders some off - diagonal elements negative .",
    "we have obtained the functions @xmath60 from the conditional correlation functions @xmath99 , then we can use the fitted functions eq . to compute other observables .",
    "fig.3 compares two fits with the leverage function @xmath83 .",
    "it is a good fit for the data without surprising since @xmath177 and @xmath60 are fitted from @xmath99 respectively , however it indeed shows that the direct one exponential fit for @xmath83 , as was usually done in previous literature@xcite , underestimates the leverage effect for individual stocks at short time .",
    "in fact , the leverage effect at @xmath178 is twice as large as the result from the one exponential fit .",
    "the large noise in @xmath83 also suggests that it is better to use @xmath99 to study leverage effect and calibrate the model .",
    "fig.4 shows that @xmath134 is mainly reproduced by the fitted functions .",
    "the calculated result only underestimates @xmath134 at small @xmath71 where @xmath60 becomes large and the leading order calculation is less accurate .",
    "fig.5 shows the even moment function @xmath121 up to @xmath179 and the plot is in logarithmic scale .",
    "@xmath121 is only evaluated at @xmath180 , the line connected between those values shows how @xmath121 grows with n. we see that the first order result gives much better overall fit to the data than the gaussian case .    to conclude the empirical study under the stationary assumption , we have calibrated the model in the leading order to the utx stock returns and checked the first order result is consistent .",
    "we find @xmath60 have two time scales . in a short time scale , @xmath181 days , @xmath182 ; in a long time scale , @xmath183 days , @xmath184 .",
    "we have checked the consistency of the model and calculation by comparing data with calculated @xmath134 and @xmath121 , the result agrees very well with the expectation from perturbation theory .",
    "it is unlikely that the feedback coefficients @xmath60 are the same during the whole period from 1939 to 2015 . in general , they may change from time to time . to assess this time dependent",
    ", we calculate the observables like @xmath185 at time @xmath12 by using the data in previous @xmath186 days , namely , the data at a small window @xmath187 $ ] .",
    "we need to pick an appropriate value of @xmath186 .",
    "it should be large enough to draw any statistically meaningful results and small enough to reflect possible time dependent behaviors of the feedback coefficients @xmath188 .",
    "we set @xmath189 days , which is comparable to the time scale of clustered volatility .",
    "since now we have a much smaller set of data , we can not reliably estimate @xmath190 for large @xmath71 lags , instead we use the average value of first @xmath191 lags .",
    "the averaged @xmath192 and @xmath193 are defined as follows .",
    "@xmath194 we also need to pick up a reasonable value of @xmath191 .",
    "it can not be too large since for a large @xmath71 , @xmath190 is small but the noise is large .",
    "we set @xmath195 days which is comparable to the time scale of leverage effect .",
    "to separate the effects of leverage and clustered volatility , we further define the averaged @xmath196 and @xmath197 as @xmath198 @xmath196 and @xmath197 measure how leverage effect and clustered volatility changes with time .",
    "those functions are defined for individual stocks .",
    "they are in general different from stock to stock . for the non - stationary study ,",
    "we focus on using those functions as a whole market indicators . therefore",
    ", we need to average @xmath196 and @xmath197 among different stocks to obtain a representative estimate of the market .",
    "the simple arithmetic average is adopted here .",
    "unlike in the stationary case , we do not confine ourselves to study only stocks in the index that survived in the whole period .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the status of the market as a whole and the new stock that replaced the old one comes from the same market that we try to estimate .",
    "after all , we average all the 30 stocks in the end .",
    "the stock replacements in the index should not affect very much our averaged results .",
    "for a comparison , we also analyze a more conventional market indicator , the volatility of the index return .",
    "the index return @xmath199 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath200    where @xmath201 is dow jones index value at time @xmath12 and @xmath202 is dow jones index divisor which makes the index value continuous .",
    "the volatility of index return at time @xmath12 , @xmath203 , is defined to be the standard deviation of index returns during the time window @xmath187 $ ] .",
    "fig.6 shows @xmath204 and @xmath205 are non - stationary and behave very differently .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath204 is significantly large than @xmath205 .",
    "this justifies our treatment of regarding @xmath206 and @xmath207 as independent variables . from @xmath192",
    ", we can obtain @xmath193 or @xmath197 and @xmath196 .",
    "fig.7 shows how @xmath197 change with time .",
    "it is certainly not constant and it experiences alternative highs and lows .",
    "the volatility of the index return in the same moving average window is also plotted in fig.7 . the clustered volatility manifests itself as alternative high and low plateaus .",
    "those plateaus show that we indeed can regard volatility and volatility feedback coefficient @xmath197 as constants for a small time window .",
    "we further notice that the jumps of @xmath197 are more regular than the jumps of index volatility , namely we can roughly separate the value of @xmath197 in the whole history by 3  phases \" . as indicated by 3 dashed horizontal lines in fig.7 , the low volatility feedback is @xmath208 , the medium one is @xmath209 , and the high one is larger than @xmath210 , which normally happened in financial crisis periods .",
    "we note @xmath197 smaller than @xmath211 and around @xmath212 for the most of the time , which partly justify to regard @xmath190 as a small quantity in our perturbative calculation .",
    "we notice that the large volatility is usually accompanied by the large value of @xmath197 .",
    "this implies that the first order feedback is not large enough to explain the appearance of large volatility , so @xmath197 itself needs to become large in order to fit the data .",
    "a possible way to deal with this large deviation of returns within the model is to assume that the innovation @xmath20 is not gaussian but some heavy tailed distribution .",
    "we can still work in the first order of @xmath60 , but now some constants like @xmath105 will be changed according to the specific distribution chosen .",
    "such a modification may make @xmath60 more stable , but it does not change the picture qualitatively .",
    "fig.8 depicts the evolution of @xmath196 .",
    "the scale of @xmath196 is @xmath213 much smaller than @xmath197 .",
    "surprisingly , @xmath196 is not always negative and it can be positive in some certain of periods .",
    "it is only consistently below zero in recent years especially after 1987 crash .",
    "although there are times its value jumps above zero after 1987 , it roughly fluctuates around @xmath214 except for financial crisis . as in the case of @xmath197 , one can also categorize the market states into 3  phases \" according to the value of @xmath196 .",
    "this  phase transition \" is most clearly seen in the recent decade .",
    "if we plot @xmath196 from @xmath215 to @xmath216 as in fig.9 , one can easily see the pattern switching behavior . before @xmath217 financial crisis ,",
    "the leverage feedback is small @xmath218 . in the period @xmath219 and @xmath220 ,",
    "the leverage feedback is large @xmath221 . in @xmath222 , @xmath196 came back to @xmath214 , but at the end of @xmath223 , it dropped to a medium value @xmath224 and stayed here until the summer crash of @xmath216 , which brought the value down to @xmath225 .",
    "the index volatility of the same period is plotted in fig.9 .",
    "we have seen the high volatility usually implies the large leverage feedback , but @xmath196 contains additional subtle features of the market that are difficult to see in the volatility alone .",
    "for example , the volatility in the period @xmath220 is much smaller than that in the period @xmath219 , but the leverage feedback is similar in those two periods . while the volatility is small in both prior to @xmath217 and after @xmath226 , the leverage effect is quite different in the two periods .",
    "in summary , we propose an alternative framework to model volatility and studied an asymmetric volatility feedback model . this asymmetry is indeed shown in the conditional correlation function @xmath99 .",
    "we define the feedback functions @xmath60 and compare our first order calculation with the data from dow jones components , we find the feedback effect has two time scales .",
    "the short one typically within one month is very sensitive to whether the past return is positive or negative , hence produces the leverage effect .",
    "the long time scale ranging from 300 days to 1000 days is responsible for the long - term clustered volatility .",
    "the feedback is symmetric at this long time scale .",
    "we use the moving averaged conditional correlation functions as a market indicator to study the time evolution of those functions .",
    "they are not constant and exhibit a rather non - trivial behavior : a pattern of alternative jumps and plateaus .",
    "both the volatility feedback @xmath227 and the leverage feedback @xmath228 become large for the market with a large volatility , which may imply the feedback mechanism is not large enough to produce the large deviation observed in the data .",
    "we also find the leverage effect becomes stronger after 1987 and a clear pattern switching behavior in recent decade .",
    "the model proposed is phenomenological in nature , it will be very interesting to see what market status could result in the features of functions @xmath60 studied here ."
