    "according to cisco s prediction  @xcite , mobile data traffic , primarily driven by video demand , will increase eleven - fold from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the extreme growth of video content on the internet , the advent of mobile devices , e.g. , smart phones and tablets , and the market appetite for them are the most important elements which have contributed to the tremendous surge in mobile traffic . conventional approaches such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access and time division multiplexing access  @xcite are used to utilize the frequency and time resources in order to improve the data communication rate . to use the spatial dimension , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communication systems emerged , e.g. , long term evolution ( lte ) and wifi technologies .",
    "mimo systems provide spatial degree of freedom in the design at the expense of interference among the transmitted data streams . in order to better utilize the available degrees of freedom , pre / post - processing at the transmitter and/or receiver",
    "ends are employed  @xcite to reduce the interference among the data streams .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in directional modulation  @xcite and symbol - level precoding for constructive interference  @xcite techniques to mitigate interference in mimo communication systems . in directional modulation ,",
    "the channel realization and the symbols are used to design the the antenna weights .",
    "these weights are designed such that the radio frequency ( rf ) signals get modulated after passing through the channel and result in communicating the desired symbol at the desired direction ( antenna ) .",
    "depending on the design , this can result in no interference  @xcite or limited interference  @xcite among the communicated data streams .",
    "both digital symbol - level precoding and directional modulation focus on multiplexing gain in mimo communication systems .",
    "directional modulation and digital symbol - level precoding for constructive interference differ in the following way .",
    "the former focuses on applying array weights in the analog domain to have the desired amplitude and phase for the received signals , while the latter uses symbol - level precoding for digital signal design at the transmitter to create constructive interference at the receiver .    apart from an increasing data demand , wireless communications consume a large amount of energy and have a considerable share in environmental pollution  @xcite . not only reducing the energy consumed in the radio access networks is environmental friendly , but it also decreases the communication costs for both the operators and users  @xcite .",
    "the research works in  @xcite study the relaxed design in constructive interference and directional modulation with the goal of reducing the energy consumption at the transmitter .",
    "although directional modulation offers transmission with no or limited interference as well as energy - efficiency , the hardware limitations at the transmitter need to be considered in the precoder design process . among the hardware limitations",
    ", we focus on keeping the power amplifier outside its saturation region . in the architecture of a directional modulation transmitter",
    ", the rf oscillator signal is equally divided among the rf chains  @xcite .",
    "each power amplifier needs to operate within a specific range to avoid nonlinear distortion of the amplified signal  @xcite . to avoid distortion in the amplified signal , we need to design the antenna weights such that the output of each power amplifier does not go into the saturation region . in this direction ,",
    "the references  @xcite consider constant envelope precoding for a single - user massive mimo system .",
    "however , the design condition of a constant envelop design is restrictive and results in a conservative design .",
    "the authors in  @xcite consider a low peak power to average ratio design based on constructive interference for @xmath1-psk modulation to limit the amplifier output power below a specific value where there is a strict constraint on the phase of the received symbols . a relaxed low peak power design for @xmath1-psk modulation in order to include both energy efficiency and hardware limitation is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "based on the above descriptions , we tackle the design of a system which jointly takes into account the user demand , power amplifier saturation as a hardware limitation , and energy efficiency when finite - alphabet input is considered .",
    "the designed precoders for gaussian input signals can be used to precode finite - alphabet inputs , however , this may result in considerable system performance reduction  @xcite .    the works of  @xcite focus on @xmath1-psk precoder design . however , there is no work on designing the @xmath1-qam directional modulation precoder for @xmath2 , while jointly utilizing the extended and relaxed detection regions of the constellation as well as controlling the power of the amplifier output signal to avoid saturation . to pursuit this design",
    ", we use the concept of directional modulation to jointly address the data rate and energy - efficiency issues of wireless communications while considering the limit on power amplifier outputs . in the directional modulation , instead of producing the symbols at the transmitter and sending them , the channel state information and the symbols to be communicated are used to produce the phase and amplitude of each transmitter rf chain . then , the transmitted rf signals are modulated after passing through the channel and create the required symbols on the intended antennas . depending on the design ,",
    "directional modulation can induce exact symbols , which can be translated into the interference - free communication , or induce a close value ( amplitude and phase ) to the symbols , which can be translated into communication with interference , on the receiving antennas . in this paper",

    "the spatial peak power minimization is carried out for @xmath1-psk modulation without considering extended and relaxed detection regions .",

    "we reveal the benefits of using extended detection regions for @xmath1-qam directional modulation transmission in terms of power reduction at the transmitter and ser improvement at the receiver . as a hardware limitation , we evaluate the performance in terms of the mentioned metrics when minimizing the instantaneous spatial peak power .",
    "in addition , we quantify the trade - off between power consumption and ser when relaxed detection regions are used while this is not investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the design for @xmath8 translates into interference - free communication since the symbols keep the standard euclidean distance .",
    "in addition , the precoder design when considering fixed inner constellation points for @xmath3 translates into the interference - free communication . on the other hand , the precoder design when considering relaxed inner constellation points for @xmath3 translates into the communication with interference .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the precoder design for @xmath9-qam is similar to @xmath10-qam .",
    "furthermore , the precoder design for @xmath11-qam and @xmath12-qam are similar to @xmath13-qam . hence , we consider precoding design for @xmath2 constellation points in this work . from practical point of view",

    "[ subfig : pow_snr ] for @xmath117 . as it is observed , the consumed power increases consistently with respect to the required snr . in relatively middle and high snr regimes , the proposed scheme results in a lower power consumption compared to the optimal linear precoding . the average maximum spatial peak power with respect to snr is shown in fig .",
    "[ subfig : pow_snr_max ] . as it is seen , directional modulation results in a lower spatial peak power compared to the optimal linear precoding in relatively middle and high snr regimes .    to study the effect of relaxed detection region design for @xmath101 with respect to snr , the average total consumed power with respect to snr is presented in fig .  [ fig : pow : snr : fixed : nt11 ] for @xmath115 and @xmath113 .",
    "the results shows that the relaxed design results in lower power consumption in low snr regime . as snr increases ,",
    "the consumed powers by the fixed and relaxed designs converge .",
    "this is due to the fact that as the required snr at the destination increases , the relaxed detection region gets relatively smaller compared to the required snr and consequently the gain of relaxed design fades out .",
    "it is seen that @xmath10-qam with relaxed design consumes lower power than @xmath13-qam in low snr since @xmath10-qam has four times more constellation points with relaxed design compared to @xmath13-qam .    the average ser with respect to the required snr is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ser ] .",
    "it is observed that the ser of zf is close to our scheme since it totally neutralize the interference in the extended detection region design . on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal linear precoding results in a higher ser compared to the proposed schemes , especially for @xmath140 , since it does not fully mitigate the interference .",
    "in addition , the difference in the ser of the proposed method and optimal linear precoding goes higher as the snr increases .",
    "the effect of low density parity check code ( ldpc ) on ber of the proposed scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ber ] .",
    "next , we investigate the effect of the relaxed detection region on ser . the average ser with respect to snr is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ser : relax ] .",
    "the relaxed detection region design increases the ser in relatively low snr regime , however , the ser gets close to the fixed design as snr increases .    as was shown , applying the relaxed detection region results in both power reduction and ser increment .",
    "to figure out the optimal value for relaxation , @xmath80 , we need to consider a metric which captures both power consumption and ser .",
    "to do so , let us consider the goodput over the total consumed power , mentioned in  , as the performance metric .",
    "the value of @xmath84 with respect to @xmath80 is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : gp ] .",
    "it is observed that there exists a value of @xmath80 for both @xmath13 and @xmath10-qam where it is possible to setup an optimal trade - off between power consumption and ser .    at the end , we present an example of the communicated @xmath10-qam constellation points at the receiver for both relaxed and fixed detection region designs of @xmath77 in figures  [ subfig:32:qam : pre : fixed ] and  [ subfig:32:qam : pre : relaxed ] . as we see , many symbols go above the required signal level at the destination , which can results in lower ser . particularly , we see that the optimally precoded points in the sets @xmath141 and @xmath142 are concentrated at the boundary of the extended detection regions .",
    "in this paper , using the concepts of extended and relaxed detection regions , we formulated the optimal directional modulation precoder design problems for @xmath64,@xmath68,@xmath13,@xmath10-qam constellation points with total and spatial peak power minimization , to reduce the power amplifier output in each rf chain , objectives and transformed these problems into standard convex forms . through directional modulation precoding",
    ", symbols are placed in the optimal location of extended and relaxed detection region . in the simulation results",
    ", we showed that the suggested @xmath1-qam directional modulation precoding consumes less power than the conventional zf in all range of snr , and less power than the optimal linear precoding for relatively middle and high snr regimes .",
    "we demonstrated that this difference in power consumption increases as the modulation order decreases .",
    "also , the results showed that directional modulation results in lower spatial peak power in all snr ranges compared to zf as well as lower spatial peak power compared to optimal linear precoding in middle and high snr regimes .",
    "the results showed that the difference between the average spatial peak power of the proposed and the benchmark schemes increases as the modulation order decreases .",
    "in addition , we saw that the interference - free communication capability of directional modulation , considering fixed design for inner constellation points of @xmath3 , results in lower ser at the receiver compared to optimal linear precoding .",
    "this difference in ser increases for @xmath140 as snr increases .",
    "considering that the proposed scheme can provide both lower power consumption and ser depending on snr and modulation order , it can provide communication at a specific rate using a lower amount of power . in case of adaptive coding and modulation , it is possible to switch to a higher order modulation , due to lower ser , using a lower power consumption at the transmitter .",
    "we demonstrated that precoder design using the relaxed detection region for inner constellation points of @xmath13-qam and @xmath10-qam results in lower power consumption and ser increment in a specific range of snr , which depends on the relaxation value .",
    "it was shown than the goodput over the total power consumption can be optimized for a specific relaxation value .",
    "to simplify  , first , we stack the constraints of   as        where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the vectors that respectively stack the real and imaginary parts of the symbols @xmath146 multiplied by @xmath147 , @xmath148 is a @xmath149 vector with elements multiplied by @xmath147 , and @xmath150 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries as @xmath146 .",
