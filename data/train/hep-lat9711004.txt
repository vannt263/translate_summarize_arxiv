    "the formulation of the lattice fermion in qcd with the chiral symmetry is one of the most fascinating problems theoretically and practically .",
    "although both wilson and kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermion formulations have been popularly used for the lattice qcd simulations , some disadvantages remain in these formulations : in the wilson fermion formulation the quark mass has additive quantum correction and the chiral limit is reached only by the fine tuning of the mass parameter . as a general rule we have to take continuum limit tuning the mass appropriately in order to simulate massless qcd . in the ks fermion formulation",
    "the number of flavors is restricted and the original flavor symmetry is broken explicitly to some residual one .    the domain - wall fermion formulation , which was originally proposed to define lattice chiral gauge theories@xcite , has been applied to the lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "this formulation is expected to have great advantage over the previous two formulations : an advantage over the ks fermion is that the number of flavor is not fixed .",
    "this is manifest from its definition .",
    "the other advantage over the wilson fermion is that mass renormalization is multiplicative ( @xmath0 ) . in other words , if a massless mode exists at the tree level it is stable against the quantum correction .",
    "this property is not a trivial one , but only an intuitive discussion on it has been given so far@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the recent numerical simulation suggests that the stability of the zero mode holds even non - perturbatively@xcite .",
    "therefore an analytical understanding of the domain - wall qcd is now needed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to confirm the stability of the massless mode by the lattice perturbation theory and to give explicitly the wave function renormalization of the quark field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will give basic tools for the perturbative calculation with the domain - wall fermion .",
    "it is enough to present only fermion propagator because other feynman rules of gauge interaction and gauge propagator are exactly identical to that of the ordinary wilson fermion . in section 3",
    "we calculate one loop corrections to the fermion propagator .",
    "section 4 is the main part of this paper , where we discuss the renormalization of the zero mode or massless quark field .",
    "we take the diagonal basis of the mass matrix of the domain - wall fermion and see that the zero mode is stable against the one loop correction .",
    "the wave function renormalization factor of the massless quark field is also given explicitly .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the mean field analysis .",
    "we show that properties of the zero mode observed in the numerical simulation@xcite are well explained in this approximation . in section 6",
    "we give our conclusion and discussion . in appendices",
    "some derivations of formulae used in the text are presented .    in this paper",

    "we set @xmath5 in the numerical calculations .",

    "the domain - wall fermion is a variant of the wilson fermion with sufficiently many flavors and special form of the mass matrix .",
    "although it is also interpreted as a five dimensional wilson fermion @xcite , we prefer to treat it as the multi - flavor system@xcite .    in this point of view",
    "only difference from the wilson fermion action is the fermion bilinear term . if we separate the qcd action for lattice perturbation theory into fermion and gauge parts , @xmath6 the lattice gauge action @xmath7 , the gauge fixing and the fp - ghost term @xmath8 , the invariant measure term @xmath9 and the gauge - fermion interaction terms in @xmath10 are exactly same as those in the ordinary wilson fermion perturbation theory @xcite with many flavors .",
