    "many recent advances in the study and classification of nuclear @xmath0-algebras have centered around understanding low - dimensional behaviour or regularity .",
    "examples of rrdam @xcite and toms @xcite , relying on techniques pioneered by villadsen @xcite , demonstrated that some sort of regularity condition , stronger than nuclearity , is necessary in order to have a classification by k - theory and traces .",
    "three candidate regularity conditions , involving quite diverse ideas , have emerged : finite nuclear dimension , tensorial absorption of the jiang - su algebra @xmath1 , and algebraic regularity in the cuntz semigroup ( more explicitly , almost unperforation and almost divisibility ) ; see @xcite for an overview .",
    "a set of conjectures have been set forth relating these properties for simple , nuclear @xmath0-algebras , and a great deal of progress has been made in proving them ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of these regularity properties in the non - simple case .",
    "we first investigate how finite nuclear dimension implies regularity in the cuntz semigroup .",
    "we show that an algebra of finite nuclear dimension without simple purely infinite subquotients has strong tracial @xmath4-comparison and @xmath5-almost divisibility , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constants ( depending on the nuclear dimension ) ; see theorem [ thm : purenonelementary ] . here and throughout",
    ", we use subquotient to mean an ideal of a quotient . as an application",
    ", we give a new proof of a significant result of dadarlat and toms , on the @xmath2-stability of infinite tensor products @xcite .",
    "another application is that , if @xmath6 is unital , has finite nuclear dimension and no simple purely infinite subquotients , then @xmath7 is hereditary inside @xmath8 .",
    "we then investigate kirchberg s central sequence algebra @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath6 is unital , this is the relative commutant of @xmath6 inside the algebra of bounded sequences in @xmath6 , modulo the @xmath10-null sequences relative to some fixed ultrafilter @xmath11 .",
    "it is the @xmath0-algebraic analogue of the central sequence algebra classically used by mcduff @xcite , and has proven to be a powerful tool in understanding @xmath0-algebras .",
    "we prove a factorization result for this algebra , allowing certain properties of the algebra @xmath6 , and especially of the sequence algebra @xmath12 to be lifted to properties of @xmath9 ; in subsequent work , we show that , in most respects , @xmath9 is substantially different from @xmath12 except when @xmath6 is quite special @xcite . here is a simplified version of the factorization result ( important , yet technical , refinements , can be found in the full statement , theorem [ thm : centralfactorization ] ) :    [ thm : centralfactorizationsimple ] let @xmath6 be a @xmath0-algebra of nuclear dimension @xmath13 .",
    "then , on any separable @xmath0-subalgebra of @xmath9 , the identity map can be factorized @xmath14 ^ -{\\bigoplus_k q_k } & & c_0 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus c_{2m+1 } \\ar[rr]^-{\\sum_k r_k } & & { \\mathrm{f}}(a ) , } \\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a hereditary subalgebra of @xmath12 and @xmath16 are c.p.c .",
    "maps such that @xmath17 is order zero for all @xmath18 . moreover , given separable @xmath0-subalgebras @xmath19 for each @xmath18 , the map @xmath20 may be modified , if necessary , so as to be an order zero map on @xmath21 .",
    "this theorem becomes our primary tool for investigating the structure of @xmath9 of a @xmath0-algebra of finite ( or even locally finite ) nuclear dimension . with this tool ,",
    "we attack the following conjectures :    1 .",
    "if a separable @xmath22-algebra has finite nuclear dimension and no elementary subquotients then it is @xmath2-stable .",
    "if a separable @xmath22-algebra has locally finite nuclear dimension and is @xmath3-pure for some @xmath23 then it is @xmath2-stable .    in ( c2 )",
    ", @xmath3-pureness means that the cuntz semigroup has @xmath4-comparison and @xmath5-almost - divisibility .",
    "notice that the first conjecture follows from the second , provided that one shows that @xmath22-algebras of finite nuclear dimension and without elementary subquotients are @xmath3-pure for some @xmath23 .",
    "we reduce these to a question of finding full orthogonal elements , see theorem [ thm : orthogz ] ; in particular , we prove :    [ thm : orthogzsimple ] let @xmath6 be a separable @xmath0-algebra with finite nuclear dimension",
    ". then @xmath6 is @xmath2-stable if and only if there exist two full orthogonal elements in @xmath9 .",
    "then , in theorems [ thm : alglattz ] and [ thm : hausdorffz ] , we settle the conjectures ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) under additional assumptions :    1 .",
    "no simple subquotient of the @xmath22-algebra is purely infinite , and 2 .",
    "the primitive spectrum of the @xmath22-algebra satisfies either one of the following 1 .",
    "it has a basis of compact open sets , or 2 .",
    "it is hausdorff .",
    "every @xmath22-algebra of locally finite decomposition rank and with the ideal property ( i.e. , such that every closed two - sided ideal is generated by its projections ) satisfies ( a1 ) and ( a2)(a ) . crossed products of the cantor set by a free @xmath24 action also satisfy ( a1 ) and ( a2)(a ) , and have been shown by szab to have finite nuclear dimension @xcite .",
    "the case ( a2)(b ) complements the main result of @xcite , and can be used to understand the range of possibilities of @xmath25-algebras with strongly self - absorbing fibres , such as the examples in @xcite .",
    "our techniques also clarify the simple case : a more conceptual and less involved proof of @xmath2-stability in the simple finite case is presented in section [ sec : simplez ] .",
    "this section also contains a separate argument for the simple infinite case , that does not appeal to kirchberg s @xmath26-absorption theorem .",
    "the obstacle to the complete resolution of the conjectures above is the construction of full orthogonal elements in the central sequence algebra , as shown by theorem [ thm : orthogzsimple ] .",
    "our approach to constructing full orthogonal elements makes use of the finiteness conditions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) , which ensure that certain orthogonal elements obtained using kirchberg s covering number and functional calculus are indeed full ( see lemmas [ lem : fullorthogonal ] , [ lem : twoorthogtrfull ] , and [ lem : alglattorthog ] ) .",
    "example [ ex : fullorthogfail ] shows definitively that this construction can not work without some kind of finiteness condition .",
    "the same construction was used by winter for the simple case in @xcite , so that finiteness ( or the existence of a nontrivial trace ) also underpins the arguments there .",
    "even the following , much weaker question remains open :    if @xmath6 is of finite nuclear dimension and without elementary quotients , does @xmath6 contain two ( almost ) full orthogonal elements ?    what is meant by @xmath6",
    "having two _ almost _ full orthogonal elements is that , given any element @xmath27 of the pedersen ideal of @xmath6 , there exist two orthogonal elements , both of which generate an ideal containing @xmath27 .",
    "( it is equivalent to having two full orthogonal elements when @xmath28 is compact . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : prelim ] we cover , among other preliminary facts , algebraic regularity properties of the cuntz semigroup , the notion of nuclear dimension , and a criterion for @xmath2-stability involving the central sequence algebra . in section [ sec : without ] we investigate the divisibility properties of @xmath22-algebras of finite nuclear dimension .",
    "we apply these results to give a simple proof of dadarlat and toms s result on the @xmath2-stability of infinite tensor products @xcite . in section [ sec : central ] we prove the above mentioned factorization of the identity on central sequence algebras . in sections",
