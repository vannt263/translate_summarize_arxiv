    "spin - orbital physics was initiated by kugel and khomskii @xcite who realized that orbital operators contribute to superexchange in mott insulators in a similar way as spins , so both degrees of freedom contribute jointly to spin - orbital superexchange @xcite . while the spin part has su(2 ) symmetry , the orbital part has remarkable orbital fluctuations @xcite and a much lower cubic symmetry in the perovskite systems where it is intrinsically frustrated @xcite .",
    "this frustration is frequently released by spin order which coexists with orbital order following the goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite , and phases arise with alternating orbital ( ao ) order along ferromagnetic ( fm ) bonds coexisting with ferro - orbital ( fo ) order along antiferromagnetic ( af ) bonds .",
    "well known examples are spin - orbital orders in lamno@xmath9 @xcite , lavo@xmath9 @xcite , and ca@xmath10ruo@xmath11 @xcite where spin - orbit coupling plays a role @xcite  the latter two examples ( v , ru ) involve @xmath12 orbitals . indeed , a rather unique example of a spin - orbital system are perovskite vanadates , where a challenging competition between two types of spin - orbital order was observed @xcite . but a different scenario is also possible  frustrated spin - orbital interactions may lead to the collapse of long - range order , as for instance in linio@xmath10 @xcite . another possibility is a spin - orbital liquid emerging from frustration @xcite .",
    "doping of mott insulators leads to several remarkable phenomena .",
    "recently short - range charge density wave called stripe phase was reported in doped cuprates @xcite . when coupled to spins it arises as self - organization of charge and spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the critical charge , orbital , and spin fluctuations near the quantum critical point provide the pairing interaction @xcite and the spectral properties of stripe phases may be seen as a signature of their stability @xcite . in manganites",
    "hole doping generates orbital polarons that emerge in an af system by double - exchange mechanism @xcite , responsible for a change from af insulator to fm metal with @xmath13 orbital liquid @xcite .    as in doped cuprates ,",
    "the holes doped in @xmath13 orbitals are mobile in lamno@xmath9 , or in kugel - khomskii system @xcite , as well as in @xmath12 stripe phases with orbital polarons @xcite .",
    "more complex phenomena are found in doped vanadates where a @xmath12 hole may hop only in two cubic directions @xcite , and robust @xmath14-type af ( @xmath14-af ) coexists with @xmath15-type ao ( @xmath15-ao ) order @xcite .",
    "doping generates finite spectral weight within the mott - hubbard gap already at low @xmath16 ca doping in y@xmath17ca@xmath18vo@xmath9 @xcite , while at higher doping the system remains insulating and develops a kinetic gap @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the consequences of _ immobile holes _ in a ruthenate due to transition metal ions with a lower valence which are substituted for ru ( @xmath5 ) ions . as an experimental motivation we mention that : ( @xmath19 )",
    "dilute cr doping for ru reduces the temperature of the orthorhombic distortion and induces fm order in ca@xmath10ru@xmath17cr@xmath18o@xmath11 ( with @xmath20 ) @xcite , and ( @xmath21 ) mn - substituted single crystals of sr@xmath9ru@xmath22mn@xmath18o@xmath23 reveal an unusual @xmath24-type af structure at @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider : ( @xmath19 ) _ orbital dilution _ by @xmath26 ( mn@xmath27 , cr@xmath28 ) impurities in ( ca , sr)@xmath10ruo@xmath11 @xcite , and ( @xmath21 ) _ charge dilution _ due to @xmath6 doping which generates hole - doublon interactions .",
    "these findings motivate the theoretical search for the consequences of both orbital and charge dilution .",
    "we show that spin - orbital order may even be globally changed and dictated by defects in case of orbital dilution with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to orbital dilution in cuprates @xcite where holes remove both spin and orbital degree of freedom , the present doping ( @xmath19 ) removes the orbital doublon but increases spin from @xmath4 to @xmath30 , while in ( @xmath21 ) spins @xmath4 stay unchanged but a doublon is replaced by a hole in an orbital ( holon ) .",
    "the spin - orbital model for ca@xmath10ruo@xmath11 mott insulator is equivalent by an electron - hole transformation to that introduced some 15 years ago for vanadates @xcite .",
    "thus we consider an interplay between @xmath4 spins and the @xmath12 orbital doublet @xmath31 for a doublon active along a given cubic axis .",
    "for instance , the doublon involves @xmath32 active orbitals along the @xmath33 axis , while @xmath34 orbitals are filled by one electron each .",
    "the model is isomorphic to the vanadate @xmath2 model @xcite , with doublons transforming into empty orbitals ( occupied by two holes ) .",
    "we label @xmath12 orbitals by index @xmath35 when a given orbital is inactive along a cubic axis @xmath36 : @xmath37        we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ruo@xmath10 @xmath38 plane in ca@xmath10ruo@xmath11 ( srruo@xmath9 ) , with ru ions connected via @xmath39 oxygen orbitals . for this plane @xmath40 ( @xmath41 )",
    "orbitals are active along the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) axis , while @xmath44 orbitals are active along both @xmath43 and @xmath42 planar axes .",
    "the superexchange for the host bonds @xmath45 along the @xmath46 axis @xcite , @xmath47 is @xmath48 and stabilizes @xmath14-af phase for the realistic parameters of ca@xmath10ruo@xmath11 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bond](a ) .",
    "the above generic form @xcite follows from charge excitations , @xmath49  the interactions depend on the intraorbital coulomb @xmath50 element and hund s exchange @xmath51 in the host .",
    "the orbital operators , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are defined by active @xmath12 orbital along the axis @xmath35 @xcite . for a bond @xmath54",
    "it may be rewritten in the orbital - only form by taking average over spin degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath55 with orbital operators @xmath56 defined by the axis @xmath35 and with coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 depending on spin average @xmath59 on a bond @xmath45 .    for",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath5 hybrid bonds charge @xmath60 excitations with the lowest energy do not generate an extra doublon but simply move it from @xmath61 to @xmath0 ion .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath62 stands for the impurity site and @xmath63 for its host neighboring ion .",
    "the energy involved in the charge excitation is , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the respective coulomb and hund s elements .",
    "in addition it depends on the ionic energy @xmath67 , i.e. , the mismatch between the energy levels of the two atoms . for mn or cr impurities in ruthenates @xmath68 and plays a role of charge - transfer energy .",
    "the energy @xmath69 ( [ delta ] ) defines two parameters which characterize the interactions along the hybrid @xmath1-@xmath5 bonds @xcite : @xmath70    the spin - orbital interaction on hybrid bond has the generic form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hhost ] ) , but the orbital operators are now defined only by the host site , and the spin operators are for @xmath4 on host and @xmath30 on impurity ion . a more transparent form of the impurity - host bond couples the impurity spin @xmath71 with the neighboring host spin @xmath72",
    " it can be written as follows @xcite , @xmath73 here the spin exchange couplings @xmath74 depend on doublon projection operator @xmath75 at host site @xmath76 , and the doublon energy @xmath77 depends on hund s exchange @xmath78 eq .",
    "( [ eq : imp ] ) .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the latter is the dominant energy scale , so for a single @xmath1-@xmath5 bond the doublon avoids the inactive ( @xmath35 ) orbital and spins couple with @xmath79 which can be either af if @xmath80 , or fm if @xmath81 .",
    "the sign change at @xmath82 marks a quantum phase transition from af to fm spin correlations , see fig . [",
    "fig : bond](c ) .",
    "similar to the 2d kugel - khomskii model @xcite , this sign change leads here to rather exotic phases with nearly frustrated spins for several doping levels @xmath83 $ ] @xcite .",
    "a single @xmath1 impurity at site @xmath19 modifies the spin - orbital order at its nearest neighbors ( nns ) @xmath84 , while second nns are little affected and thus they typically follow the @xmath14-af/@xmath15-ao order in the host .",
    "in particular , the impurity spin reorients within the orbital polaron at @xmath85 which marks a transition from af to fm regime .    both for a single impurity and at low @xmath86 doping , the @xmath1-@xmath5 bonds influence strongly spin - orbital order @xcite . for a higher periodic doping @xmath29 when half of the superexchange bonds are @xmath1-@xmath5 hybrid bonds , the overall spin - orbital order is dictated by them @xcite .",
    "one finds that only every second undoped vertical line @xmath87 is fm , as in the @xmath14-af host phase , and host spins are inverted on any other vertical line and the doublon flips from orbital @xmath43 to @xmath42 .",
    "such a modification of the orbital order stabilizes the fm interactions for @xmath33-@xmath43 doublon pairs on the horizontal bonds by double - exchange , in analogy to a doped @xmath12 system @xcite . in the phase diagram at @xmath29 doping",
    "@xcite one finds a broad region of parameters where impurity spins are also frustrated .",
    "frustration is released by quantum fluctuations which stabilize impurity spin orientation opposite to that expected in the host . at sufficiently large @xmath78 ( [ eq : imp ] ) , fm spin order takes over and @xmath15-ao order is then the same as in the undoped host .",
    "thus , the most interesting novel spin - orbital phases are indeed found at the crossover from af to fm interactions along hybrid bonds .",
    "charge dilution ( with periodic cluster of @xmath88 sites ) in two af phases in an @xmath38 plane : left  @xmath14-af phase with fm vertical ( @xmath87 ) lines , and right  nel af phase ( shown by arrows for @xmath89 ) .",
    "orbital fluctuations on the bonds around the impurity at site @xmath90 are @xmath91 ( [ eq : h24 ] ) and increase from top to bottom .",
    "bottom right  color convention for an orbital occupied by a doublon at host sites and a hole at impurity site ( red circles ) , as well as the cluster of @xmath88 sites ( dotted square ) with the periodic boundary conditions on outer ( red ) bonds . ]",
    "doping a spin - orbital @xmath92 system by @xmath93 ions is even more challenging . in this case",
    "the impurity itself has another orbital degree of freedom , a hole ( holon ) in place of a doublon .",
    "a particular feature of @xmath2 ions is that they promote orbital fluctuations in case when @xmath33 orbital ( @xmath34 ) is filled by one electron at all sites , and the other two @xmath94 ( @xmath32 ) fluctuate along the @xmath33 axis , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : or_defs ] ) .",
    "this supports fm spin order even in the absence of hund s exchange @xcite .",
    "it is thus challenging to consider such ions within a ruthenate where similar orbital fluctuations are also expected .",
    "the generic form of spin - orbital superexchange ( [ eq : hhost ] ) applies as well to the hybrid @xmath2-@xmath5 bonds where charge @xmath95 excitations may generate an extra doublon in intermediate states at a @xmath0 ion for af bonds ( not shown ) , or instead they create a high - spin state along fm bonds , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bond](d ) . as a result ,",
    "the spin - orbital interactions are here quite complex and include several terms , so we do not reproduce them here .",
    "they are controlled again by the charge - transfer energy and the same effective parameters as for orbital dilution , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : imp ] ) .",
    "again , the spin exchange depends on whether the doublon at the host ion is in the active or inactive orbital on the considered @xmath2-@xmath5 bond .",
    "it also depends on the configuration at the impurity site , i.e. , whether the holon is in an active or inactive orbital .",
    "the derivation of spin - orbital superexchange for the hybrid @xmath2-@xmath5 bonds demonstrates a remarkable difference to the orbital dilution on @xmath1-@xmath5 bonds discussed above .",
    "consider first the af spin bond shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond](d ) .",
    "charge excitations , @xmath95 , create , _ inter alia _ , two high - spin configurations which generate novel orbital quantum fluctuations , @xmath7 , which go beyond those found in the host @xcite .",
    "in addition , a doublon may be created at the @xmath0 impurity ion and such configurations have to be combined with others to obtain eigenstates at both sites at finite @xmath96 . as a result , the fluctuations @xmath7 are amplified .",
    "they are accompanied by ising orbital exchange terms and the usual fluctuations @xmath97 activated by finite hund s exchange ( not shown ) . for a fm spin configuration",
    "the doublon gets a partner empty orbital at the host site and again , orbital quantum fluctuations @xmath98 arise at finite @xmath51 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bond](e ) .    altogether , after averaging spin correlations , the purely orbital superexchange is , @xmath99 with orbital operators @xmath56 defined by the bond direction and the coefficients @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "as these parameters for the present hybrid bond are similar to those in the host ( [ eq : h44 ] ) , we use below , @xmath103 i.e. , we characterize the orbital superexchange on the hybrid bonds by the parameter @xmath104 which stands for double excitations in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond](d ) . due to",
    "such terms the orbital quantum number @xmath105 is not conserved .",
    "a more complete analysis of charge dilution and the resulting phase diagrams will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we focus on the consequences of orbital fluctuations @xmath106 , both in @xmath14-af and nel af spin configurations in the @xmath38 plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : of ] . quantum fluctuations in the spin subsystem are small for @xmath4 spins and we neglect them . for realistic hund s exchange in the host and at the holon ion one",
    "expects @xmath14-af order .",
    "its orbital pattern at @xmath89 has equal orbital densities in @xmath43 and @xmath33 orbitals , see left column in fig .",
    "[ fig : of ] .",
    "indeed , this configuration guarantees maximal doublon fluctuations along the @xmath42 axis where the order is fm , as in the vanadium perovskites with holon fluctuations involving @xmath43 and @xmath42 orbitals along the @xmath33 axis @xcite . increasing",
    "orbital fluctuations gradually destroy this optimal state and favor ao order along vertical fm columns , with enhanced @xmath43 or @xmath33 holon density at every other site . for small @xmath107",
    "the @xmath108 term is active only along @xmath42-bonds and consequently there is no admixture of @xmath42 orbitals in the ground state . at larger @xmath109",
    "we see the appearance of the @xmath42 orbital polarization at the impurity site and two neighboring host sites along @xmath43 axis which goes together with a severe change of the global orbital order . at @xmath110",
    "a new state appears with almost complete separation into horizontal chains of @xmath43 ( @xmath33 ) orbitals and a small admixture of @xmath42 orbital density .",
    "holon site has a similar orbital density distribution , with somewhat enhanced @xmath42 character .",
    "we suggest that the orbital fluctuations of alternating @xmath43 and @xmath33 orbitals along the vertical bonds replace here double exchange to stabilize fm spin order , while such fluctuations for the same orbitals along the horizontal bonds support af spin order .",
    "actually , fo order in the @xmath38 plane supports af nel state following the goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite , see the right column in fig .",
    "[ fig : of ] .",
    "this state is more robust and almost unchanged by double excitations @xmath7 with a realistic @xmath109 , and only at a high value of @xmath111 one finds increased @xmath43 or @xmath42 orbital densities following the checkerboard pattern around the impurity .",
    "this effect seems to be purely local because already the second neighbors of the impurity in the host are unaffected even for such a large value of @xmath104 . unlike in @xmath14-af spin order",
    ", we see that the defects in the orbital configurations are strongly localized or screened by the host .",
    "this screening has an interesting geometrical mechanism : if we look around the impurity we see that the up and down neighbors get an admixture of the @xmath43 orbitals from the @xmath7 terms induced by the impurity .",
    "these @xmath43-orbital defects can not however delocalize in the @xmath43 direction ( along two such bonds ) .",
    "the defects can only move up , to the site number @xmath112 in the cluster ( see bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fig : of ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal neighbors of the impurity are in analogical situation with @xmath42-orbital defects which for the same reason can only go to the same site number @xmath112 .",
    "finally , at this site one expects a destructive interference of the @xmath43-orbital defects going from the top and bottom bonds and the @xmath42-orbital defects going from the left and right ones as it exhibits only the initial @xmath33-orbital polarization .",
    "it is thus possible that for a different distribution of impurities we would observe a much weaker localization of the defects .",
    "orbital ( charge ) dilution plays a role in several mott insulators with spin - orbital order doped by transition metal ions with either @xmath1 or @xmath2 electron configuration .",
    "we have shown that the orbital order around such impurities changes in general , so even in the dilute limit one may expect observable effects such as islands of reversed spins or doublon fluctuations .",
    "we argue that the general trends reported here are generic and a meaningful insights into phase diagrams of systems with orbital dilution may be gained by investigating classical phase diagrams as quantum fluctuations are small @xcite .",
    "double exchange leads to local or global changes of spin - orbital order , similar to orbital polarons @xcite or dimensional crossover with a change from @xmath15-af to @xmath14-af order in electron doped manganites @xcite .",
    "doping may also generate novel spin - orbital - charge modulated patterns reported recently for @xmath12 systems @xcite .",
    "summarizing , this study highlights the role played by orbital or charge dilution by transition metal ions in cubic spin - orbital systems and provides new insights necessary for theoretical understanding of ( mn , cr)-doped layered ruthenates and related systems .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that @xmath1 impurities change radically spin - orbital order , and we expect an even stronger impact of @xmath2 impurities on spin - orbital order in the @xmath5 host  the changes may be strongly centered around the impurity sites , as shown in the fo case , or completely smeared out by the host s fluctuations , as in the @xmath14-af case .",
    "the theoretical studies of this doping are under way .",
