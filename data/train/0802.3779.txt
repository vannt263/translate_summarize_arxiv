    "when hot gas accretes , since the scale height of the gas is large , large eddies are formed in the magnetically turbulent disk and create a large scale coherent magnetic field which transports angular momentum efficiently . on the other hand ,",
    "when low - temperature gas is supplied , since the scale height and eddy size become smaller , angular momentum is transported only in the local region .",
    "thus the angular momentum is transported more efficiently in high temperature disks .",
    "low temperature plasmas can be supplied when cooling instability takes place in the outer disk .",
    "@xcite carried out a global 3d mhd simulation of black hole accretion flows by including radiative cooling .",
    "they showed that when the density of the outer disk is sufficiently high , cooling instability takes place .",
    "the outer disk shrinks vertically , and forms a magnetically supported , cool , optically thin disk .",
    "when such cool plasma accretes , the magnetic cycle may be excited in the inner region .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath192 non - axisymmetric mode correlates positively with the joule heating rate in model ht but anti - correlates in model lt . in model",
    "ht , since the angular momentum transport rate is large enough , mass smoothly accretes along the spiral channel , in which the magnetic fields are stretched and form a current sheet .",
    "magnetic energy is released in such current sheets .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the @xmath192 mode correlates with the joule heating rate . on the other hand , in model lt ,",
    "non - axisymmetric @xmath192 pattern disappears when the magnetic energy is released .",
    "@xcite pointed out that during the transition from the lhs to hss , gx339@xmath2324 shows a sub - transition from hims dominated by power - law x - ray radiation to soft intermediated state ( sims ) dominated by radiation from an optically thick disk .",
    "they also showed that the low - frequency qpos appear when the x - ray spectrum stays in hims and sims and sometimes in lhs .",
    "the high - frequency qpos appear in the hims and sims .",
    "when the high - frequency qpo is observed , a low - frequency qpo is always observed in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this tendency is consistent with our simulation results .",
    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed for high - frequency qpos .",
    "@xcite proposed that high - frequency qpos are formed by the resonance of radial and vertical oscillations .",
    "@xcite studied the excitation of high - frequency qpos by resonance with the disk warp . in our simulation",
    ", a high - frequency peak appears around @xmath233 when the low - frequency oscillation is prominent . in our simulation , however , the low - frequency oscillation was weakened due to the heating of the inner torus .",
    "we expect that when the extra heating is extracted by radiative cooling , the magnetic cycle may continue and excite high - frequency qpos .",
    "we would like to report the results of numerical simulations including radiative cooling in subsequent papers .    in this work ,",
    "we treated the relativistic effect by using the pseudo - newtonian potential .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation is worst near the black hole s horizon especially for spinning black holes .",
    "when we include the effects of black hole spin , the inner torus will be formed closer to the black hole .",
    "thus , higher frequency qpos will appear due to the oscillation of the inner torus .",
    "we should note that disk luminosity depends on the relativistic beaming and light bending . in subsequent papers",
    ", we would like to report psds obtained by relativistic ray - tracing of numerical results .",
