    "the recent cosmological data indicate that the universe is spatially flat and has suffered two acceleration phases .",
    "an early acceleration phase ( inflation ) , which occurred prior to the radiation dominated era and a recently initiated accelerated expansion .    an easy way to explain",
    "this expansion is to consider an additional fluid with negative equation of state parameter , usually called dark energy , that dominates the universe at late times . in spite of that , the absence of a fundamental physical theory , regarding the mechanism inducing the cosmic acceleration , has given rise to a plethora of alternative cosmological scenarios .",
    "most of them are based either on the existence of new fields in nature ( dark energy ) or in some modification of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , with the present accelerating stage appearing as a sort of geometric effect ( geometrical  dark energy ) .",
    "the simplest dark energy probe is the cosmological constant @xmath1(vacuum ) leading to the @xmath1cdm cosmology weinberg89,peebles03,pad03 .",
    "however , it has been shown that @xmath1cdm cosmology suffers from two major drawbacks known as  the fine tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "besides @xmath1cdm cosmology ,  many other candidates have been proposed in the literature , such as time - varying @xmath2  cosmologies , quintessence , @xmath3essence , tachyons , modifications of gravity , chaplygin gas and others ratra88,lambda4,bas09c , linder2004,lss08,brookfield2005td .",
    "there are other possibilities to explain the present accelerating stage .",
    "for instance , one may consider that the dynamical effects attributed to dark energy can be resembled by the effects of a nonstandard gravity theory .",
    "in other words , the present accelerating stage of the universe can be driven only by cold dark matter , under a modification of the nature of gravity .",
    "such a reduction of the so - called dark sector is naturally obtained in the @xmath4 gravity theories @xcite . in the original nonstandard gravity models ,",
    "one modifies the einstein - hilbert action with a general function @xmath4 of the ricci scalar @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 approach is a relative simple but still a fundamental tool used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "a pioneering fundamental approach was proposed long ago with @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "later on , the @xmath6 models were further explored from different points of view in carrol , amendola-2007a , amendola-2007b and indeed a large number of functional forms of @xmath6 gravity is currently available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate which @xmath6 models admit extra noether point symmetries and use the first integrals of these models to determine analytic solutions of their field equations .",
    "the idea to use noether symmetries in cosmological studies is not new and indeed a lot of attention has been paid in the literature ( see cap96,cotsakis , rubanosfq , sanyal05,szy06,cap07,capa07,bona07,vakili08,tsamgrg , basilakos11,vakili11,jamil11,chirst12,cap12,wei2012 ) .",
    "the main reasons for the consideration of this hypothesis is that ( a ) the noether point symmetries provide integrals , which assist the integrability of the system , ( b ) is a geometric criterion because the noether symmetries associated with the geometry of the field equations .",
    "a fundamental approach to derive the noether point symmetries of a given dynamical system moving in a riemannian space has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic theoretical elements of the problem are presented in section [ cmg ] , where we also introduce the basic frw cosmological equations in the framework of @xmath6 models .",
    "the geometrical noether point symmetries and their connections to the @xmath6 models are discussed in sections [ lien ] . in section [ analsol ]",
    "we provide analytical solutions for those @xmath6 models which are liouville integrable via noether point symmetries . in section [ nonf ]  we study the noether symmetries in spatially non flat @xmath6 cosmological models .",
    "finally , we draw our main conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "consider the modified einstein - hilbert action : @xmath8   \\label{action1}\\]]where @xmath9 is the lagrangian of dust - like ( @xmath10 ) matter and @xmath11 . varying the action with respect to the metric we arrive at @xmath12 \\delta _ { \\;\\nu } ^{\\mu } = k^{2}\\,t_{\\nu }",
    "^{\\mu }   \\label{ee}\\]]where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath13 is the einstein tensor and @xmath14 is the ordinary energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "based on the matter era we treat the expanding universe as a perfect fluid which includes only cold dark matter with comoving observers @xmath15 . thus the energy momentum tensor becomes @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the energy density of the cosmic fluid .",
    "now , in the context of a flat frw model the metric is @xmath18the components of the einstein tensor are computed to be : @xmath19inserting ( [ ein.1 ] ) into the modified einstein s field equations ( ee ) , for comoving observers , we derive the modified friedman s equation @xmath20    @xmath21    the contraction of the ricci tensor provides the ricci scalar @xmath22the bianchi identity @xmath23 leads to the matter conservation law:@xmath24whose solution is @xmath25note that the over - dot denotes derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the hubble parameter .",
    "if we consider @xmath28 then the field equations ( [ ee ] ) boil down to the einstein s equations a solution of which is the einstein de sitter model . on the other hand ,",
    "the concordance @xmath1 cosmology is fully recovered for @xmath29 .    from the current analysis",
    "it becomes clear that unlike the standard friedman equations in einstein s gr the modified equations of motion ( [ motion1 ] ) and ( [ motion2 ] ) are complicated and thus it is difficult to solve them analytically .",
    "we would like to stress here that within the context of the metric formalism the above @xmath6 cosmological models must obey simultaneously some strong conditions @xcite .",
    "these are : ( i ) @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the ricci scalar at the present time . if the final attractor is a de sitter point we need to have @xmath30 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ricci scalar at the de sitter point , ( ii ) @xmath35 for @xmath36 , ( iii ) @xmath37 for @xmath38 and finally ( iv ) @xmath39 at @xmath40",
    "in the last decade a large number of experiments have been proposed in order to constrain dark energy and study its evolution .",
    "naturally , in order to establish the evolution of the dark energy ( geometrical  in the current work ) equation of state parameter a realistic form of @xmath41 is required while the included free parameters must be constrained through a combination of independent de probes ( for example snia , baos , cmb etc ) . however , a weak point here is the fact that the majority of the @xmath6 models appeared in the literature are plagued with no clear physical basis and/or many free parameters .",
    "due to the large number of free parameters many such models could fit the data .",
    "the proposed additional criterion of noether point symmetry requirement is a physically meaning - full geometric ansatz .    according to the theory of general relativity , the space - time symmetries ( killing and homothetic vectors ) via the einstein s field equations ,",
    "are also symmetries of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "due to the fact that the @xmath42 models provide a natural generalization of gr one would expect that the theories of modified gravity must inherit the symmetries of the space - time as the usual gravity ( gr ) does .",
    "furthermore , besides the geometric symmetries we have to consider the dynamical symmetries , which are the symmetries of the field equations ( lie symmetries ) .",
    "if the field equations are derived from a lagrangian then there is a special class of lie symmetries , the noether symmetries , which lead to conserved currents or , equivalently , to first integrals of the equations of motion .",
    "the noether integrals are used to reduce the order of the field equations or even to solve them .",
    "therefore a sound requirement , which is possible to be made in lagrangian theories , is that they admit extra noether symmetries .",
    "this assumption is model independent , because it is imposed after the field equations have been derived , therefore it does not lead to conflict with the geometric symmetries while , at the same time , serves the original purpose of a selection rule .",
    "of course , it is possible that a different method could be assumed and select another subset of viable models .",
    "however , symmetry has always played a dominant role in physics and this gives an aesthetic and a physical priority to our proposal .    in the lagrangian context",
    ", the main field equations ( [ motion1 ] ) and ( motion2 ) , described in section [ cmg ] , can be produced by the following lagrangian : @xmath43 in the space of the variables @xmath44 . using eq.([sf.50 ] )",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian of the current dynamical system @xmath45or @xmath46 \\;. \\label{sf.61e}\\]]combining the first equation of motion ( [ motion1 ] ) with eq.([sf.61e ] ) we find @xmath47the latter equation together with @xmath48 implies that @xmath49where @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the critical density at the present time and @xmath52 is the hubble constant .",
    "we note that the current lagrangian eq.([sf.50 ] ) is time independent implying that the dynamical system is autonomous hence the hamiltonian @xmath53 is conserved ( @xmath54 ) .",
