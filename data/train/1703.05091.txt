    "the corresponding hilbert space becomes defective in that the number of eigenvectors is reduced as a consequence of the coalescence .",
    "eps show more characteristic properties than those mentioned above : in their simplest manifestation , i.e. , for an ep2 , the two eigenvalues can be mathematically described by two branches of the same analytic function , thus showing typical square root behavior .",
    "this means , if one encircles the ep2 along a closed loop in the physical parameter space the corresponding eigenvalues forming an ep2 permute .",
    "exceptional points of higher order , e.g. , third - order exceptional points , show cubic root behavior , i.e. , one _ typically _ observes a threefold state exchange performing a closed loop around the ep3 .",
    "moreover , since also the eigenvectors coalesce at the exceptional point  forming a _ self - orthogonal _ state  @xcite  the corresponding hamiltonian in matrix representation is no longer diagonalizable . with a similarity transformation ,",

    "the direction of propagation in the wave guides is taken to be the @xmath17 axis , such that the wave equation for the transverse - electric modes reads @xmath18 where the @xmath19 component of the electric field is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and the propagation constant @xmath22 .",

    "]    the characteristic threefold permutation of the propagation constants becomes obvious in both cases while the circle for the @xmath52asymmetry shows higher symmetry compared to the loop performed in the @xmath8-@xmath50space .",
    "note that the numerical precision achieved in this work as shown in eq .",
    "is not realizable in an experiment .",
    "however , as the ep3 splits into two ep2s under a generic perturbation , the threefold permutation remains unchanged when both ep2s are encircled , i.e. for small perturbations the ep3-signature persists .",

    "it is a phenomenon that has so far attracted little attention but an awareness appears to be of utmost importance in an expected experimental confirmation .",
    "as is qualitatively discussed in @xcite a perturbation by only one of the parameters that were chosen to invoke the third - root branch point infers three eigenvalues to pop out in the energy plane from the ep3 . in turn , the ep3 can be seen as a coalescence of two ep2s as the three eigenvalues  obtained from this perturbation  are still analytically connected .",
