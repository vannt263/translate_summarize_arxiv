    "compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by hot intracluster gas  the sunyaev - zeldovich effect  ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 , 1980 ) provides a useful method to measure the hubble constant @xmath4 ( gunn 1978 ; silk & white 1978 ; birkinshaw 1979 ; cavaliere , danese , & de zotti 1979 ; birkinshaw , hughes , & arnaud 1991 ; birkinshaw & hughes 1994 ; myers et al . 1995 ; herbig et al .",

    "the sunyaev - zeldovich formula has been derived from a kinetic equation for the photon distribution function taking into account the compton scattering by electrons  the kompaneets equation  ( kompaneets 1957 ; weymann 1965 ) .",
    "the kompaneets equation has been derived with the non - relativistic approximation for the electron .",
    "however , the electrons in the clusters of galaxies are extremely hot , @xmath5 = @xmath6kev ( arnaud et al . 1994 ; markevitch et al . 1994 ; markevitch et al . 1996 ; holzapfel et al . 1997 ) .",
    "recently attempts have been made to include the relativistic corrections in the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( rephaeli 1995 ; rephaeli & yankovitch 1997 ) .",
    "however , it appears that the calculations have not been carried out in a manifestly covariant form .",
    "for example , equation ( 4 ) in rephaeli ( 1995 ) , which comes from chandrasekhar ( 1950 ) , is a non - relativistic formula .",
    "since the extension of the kompaneets equation to the relativistic regime is extremely important in view of many recent measurements of the hubble constant @xmath4 with the use of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , we will solve the kinetic equation for the photon distribution function in a manifestly covariant form taking into account the compton scattering by electrons .    very recently",
    "a generalized kompaneets equation has been derived by two groups ( stebbins ( 1997 ) ; challinor & lasenby ( 1997 ) ) . by using the generalized kompaneets equation ,",
    "analytic expressions for the sunyaev - zeldovich effect have been derived as a power series of @xmath7 = @xmath8 , where @xmath2 and @xmath9 are the electron temperature and the electron mass , respectively .",
    "it has been shown that the results obtained by a power series expansion agree with the previous numerical calculations by rephaeli ( 1995 ) and rephaeli & yankovitch ( 1997 ) .",
    "analytic expressions are compact and extremely useful to study the sunyaev - zeldovich effect . on the other hand , it has been pointed out by challinor & lasenby ( 1997 ) that the convergence of the power series expansion in @xmath7 is slow .",
    "they suspect that the expansion is an asymptotic expansion .",
    "therefore , it is extremely important to study the extent of the @xmath7 region where the analytic expressions can be applied .",
    "this is the main subject in the present paper . following the approach of challinor & lasenby ( 1997 )",
    ", we will derive analytic expressions for the intensity change of the photon spectrum . in the derivation we will take into account the relativistic terms up to the fifth order in @xmath7 . in order to examine the accuracy of the analytic expressions derived from the power series expansion , we will directly integrate the boltzmann equation numerically . comparing these results we will carefully study the valid region for the electron temperature @xmath2 and for the photon angular frequency @xmath10 where",
