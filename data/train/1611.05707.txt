    "<S> both @xmath126 and @xmath127 are symmetric second order tensors . </S>",
    "<S> as above , a signal field may provide cells with directional information quantified by a nematic tensor @xmath128 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> active stress is given by @xmath129 , while active rearrangement reads @xmath130 ( supplemental data ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an incompressible tissue , @xmath131 is absorbed into the pressure term .    again assuming an isotropic stress environment ( @xmath132 ) and setting @xmath114 , @xmath133 is non - zero and the tissue keeps flowing . in </S>",
    "<S> spatially homogeneous , steady state conditions , the tissue deformation rate is calculated as @xmath134 both the active stress and the active rearrangement drive the contraction along the @xmath96-axis and the elongation along the @xmath94-axis . </S>",
    "<S> note however that the cell shape anisotropy @xmath40 depends only on the active stress , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion  _ starting from the elastic energy of cell - based models , we developed a rheological model for epithelia . </S>",
    "<S> advantages of the approach can be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , the model is designed to connect cell and tissue dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it gives clear insights into many unanswered questions including how cell level mechanical ingredients ( _ e.g. _ , cell area elasticity and cell junction tension ) and morphogenetic cell processes ( _ e.g. _ , cell rearrangement ) are related to tissue mechanics and deformation . </S>",
    "<S> second , it deals naturally with large deformations . </S>",
    "<S> third , it can incorporate a signal field , for instance the axial tensor @xmath128 that orients active stress and cell rearrangement in this study . </S>",
    "<S> fourth , many of the relevant fields can be experimentally measured , including tissue stress , tissue deformation , cell processes , and chemical signaling such as the concentration field of cell polarity molecules or the orientation field describing the spatial distribution of myosins . </S>",
    "<S> once their dynamics are quantitatively characterized by scalar , vector , or tensor variables @xcite , comparison between model predictions and experimental observations will be straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> our 2d approach can be easily extended to 3d . </S>",
    "<S> other morphogenetic cell processes , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , cell growth , cell division and apoptosis , need to be incorporated to the current modeling scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possible extension of the model regards kinetics . here </S>",
    "<S> , associated dissipation coefficients were determined phenomenologically . </S>",
    "<S> this point can be further explored by considering detailed processes at the cell level .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , the present work provides an integrated scheme for understanding mechanical control of epithelial morphogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> feedback between biochemical signaling and mechanics via mechanosensing of a cell @xcite is one among research directions to pursue .    </S>",
