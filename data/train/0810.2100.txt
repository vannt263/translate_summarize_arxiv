    "early observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies clearly indicated the presence of `` missing '' matter in these objects ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this `` missing '' or `` dark '' matter , as it is now more commonly called , has since become one of the pillars of modern cosmology . an elaborate framework ,",
    "explaining and describing the properties of the universe has been built , involving a cosmological constant @xmath1 , and a form of collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the @xmath1cdm paradigm provides a comprehensive description of the universe at large ( as shown by , e.g. , the wmap results , see @xcite ) , but problems on smaller ( galaxy ) scales remain .",
    "a well - known problem is that galaxy - scale structures formed in cosmological @xmath1cdm simulations are too compact .",
    "one symptom of this is the well - known missing satellite problem ( simulations produce an overabundance of dwarf galaxy halos , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . this seems to have been alleviated somewhat by the recent discovery of many faint dwarfs in our local group  some of which seem to be dominated by dark matter  but the discrepancy is still significant @xcite .    the so - called cusp - core discrepancy ( the predicted dark matter density profiles in galaxy halos are too steep ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) is another manifestation of the ( too ) compact structures in cdm simulations .",
    "galaxy rotation curves have in the last decade taken center stage in the debate about this problem . going into some more detail ,",
    "results from cosmological @xmath1cdm simulations suggest that the density profiles of dark matter halos should be nearly universal , independent of the mass of the halo .",
    "this density profile has a characteristic steep mass - density slope in the inner parts which can be approximated with a power - law @xmath2 with @xmath3 ; this is the so - called `` cusp '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "extensive observational determinations of this inner mass - density distribution seem , however , to indicate that the mass - density profiles of dark matter halos can be better described using an approximately constant - density inner `` core '' ( @xmath2 with @xmath4 ) .",

    "hi  synthesis observations of disk galaxies would , in principle , be eminently suited to address this problem .",
    "the hi  disks of galaxies have a higher filling factor than the often patchy h@xmath5 distributions used for optical rotation curves .",
    "measuring accurate velocities and modeling them across the entire , two - dimensional , filled hi  disks is therefore one of the strengths of radio synthesis observations .",
    "this means that possible effects of non - circular motions , which may not always be recognized in one - dimensional slit observations , can be analyzed within the context of the surrounding rotating disk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a determination of the position of the dynamical center can be made , enabling a direct and independent comparison with the position of the photometric center @xcite . in short ,",
    "the rotation curve , as well as the uncertainties that could affect it , can be constrained by the same observation .",
    "the one major disadvantage which hitherto hampered making the fullest possible use of hi  data in these analyses , has been their modest angular resolution , especially when compared to optical observations : to directly address cosmologically relevant questions regarding the distribution of dark matter requires high spatial resolution .",
    "for example , unambiguously distinguishing between a core and a cusp , requires physical resolutions better than @xmath6 kpc @xcite . also , to determine the importance of non - circular motions within the disks of galaxies one needs to resolve the size scales associated with features that cause these motions , such as bars , spiral arms and oval distortions .",
    "the majority of published hi  synthesis observations have at best beam sizes @xmath7 , meaning they can reach the desired sub - kpc resolution only out to distances of @xmath8 mpc .",
    "this , of course , severely limits the number of galaxies available for study .",
    "things ( the hi   nearby galaxy survey ) has addressed this by observing in hi  a sample of 34 nearby galaxies at the desired sub - kpc resolution . to achieve this",
    ", it used the nrao very large array ( vla ) in its b , c and d configurations . the total observing time",
    "( including data retrieved from the archive ) was @xmath9 hours .",
    "the maximum angular resolution that can be achieved with these data is @xmath10 for robust weighting and @xmath11 for natural weighting .",
    "the velocity resolution is 5.2 km s@xmath12 or better . with the sample galaxies at distances between 2 and 15 mpc",
    ", the typical linear resolution varies between @xmath13 and @xmath9 pc . for further discussion on the sample , aims and scientific goals of things , as well as the technical details of the observations , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the current paper focuses on the rotation curves of things galaxies .",
    "we use a sub - sample of the things galaxies ( discussed in sec .  2 ) and present their velocity fields , tilted - ring models and the rotation curves . additionally , we combine our hi  data with 3.6 @xmath0 m data from sings , the _ spitzer",
    "_ infrared nearby galaxies survey @xcite and derive well - constrained stellar mass - to - light ratios for the stellar disks .",
    "we use these to investigate the mass distributions in the sample galaxies using core- and cusp - dominated dark matter halo models .",
    "a number of galaxies presented here have been observed in the past , in some cases as part of the pioneering work on hi  rotation curves in the 1970s and 1980s , but this is the first time that such a large sample of galaxies is analyzed and modeled in a uniform way at sub - kpc resolution .    in sect .",

    "the results are discussed in sect .  7 and summarized in sect .  8 .",
    "technical aspects of the analysis are presented in appendix  a.",
    "our goal in this paper is to derive rotation curves of things galaxies which depend on a minimum amount of external information .",
    "that is , we aim to derive the geometrical and kinematical parameters of the galaxies ( inclination , position angle , rotation velocity , etc . )",
    "as much as possible from the things hi  data alone .",
    "this limits our analysis to rotationally dominated galaxies with favorable orientations .",
    "although using additional information ( such as derived from optical data ) would , in principle , increase the number of things galaxies for which a rotation curve can be determined , the unquantifiable systematic effects associated with this introduce their own difficulties , as discussed below .",
    "there are practical upper and lower limits to the inclinations of galaxies for which one can reliably derive rotation curves using standard methods . at very high inclinations ( @xmath14 )",
    "the line of sight crosses a large range of projected velocities and it becomes difficult to quantify the typical rotation velocity ( although not impossible , see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such high - inclination galaxies are , however , not present in the things sample .    at low inclinations ,",
    "the practical limit lies at @xmath15 @xcite . at lower inclinations the velocity dispersion of the gas starts to become an important contaminant .",
    "as rotation takes place in a two - dimensional disk , the line - of - sight ( projected ) component of this rotation velocity decreases in amplitude with decreasing inclination , whereas the contribution due to random motions , which take place in three dimensions , remains the same .",
    "this leads to unacceptably large uncertainties in the deprojected rotational velocity .",
    "independent of inclination , we also require our sample galaxies to be dominated by rotation . this is not the case for a small number of things galaxies .",
    "these are m81dwa @xcite and m81dwb , as well as ngc 1569 ( dynamics disturbed by a starburst ; @xcite ) , ngc 3077 ( heavily interacting with m81 ; @xcite ) and ngc 4449 ( tidally disturbed ; @xcite ) .",

    "care was taken that these fits were not affected by the tails , clouds , and other features often seen in the outer parts of the hi  disks .",
    "the hi  inclinations listed here are deemed to be as reliable as their optical counterparts , and in some cases even preferable ( cf .",
    "the values for ddo 154 and the associated images in @xcite ) .",

    "these galaxies are all discussed in the current paper .",
    "galaxies with hi  inclinations less than 30@xmath16 are unsuitable and will not be discussed any further here .",
    "of the galaxies with hi  inclinations between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , only ngc 6946 proved suitable .",
    "the reason why for this galaxy a rotation curve can be derived , whereas this was not possible for , e.g. , ngc 4214 ( which has a comparable indicative hi  inclination ) , is the large ratio of galaxy size to beam size . the resulting larger number of resolution elements in the ngc 6946 velocity field help constrain the kinematics better than for the other galaxies in that ( hi ) inclination range .",
    "a look at table  [ table1 ] shows that there are a few cases where the hi  and optical inclinations differ substantially . these can , however , be readily explained .",
    "ddo 154 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) has a well - defined and regular hi  disk , but a low surface brightness ill - defined optical component .",
    "the hi  inclination is thus far more reliable .",
    "m81 dwb ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) has a high - surface brightness central bar - like structure which affects the optically derived inclination .",
    "ngc 3351 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) has a fairly face - on and regular hi  disk , but optically is dominated by a very strong central bar .",
    "ngc 4736 ( @xmath25 , @xmath20 ) is the only galaxy where the outer hi  disk seems to have a genuinely higher inclination than the central optical component in the inner parts to @xmath26 in the outer parts . ] .",
    "one might argue that our choice to only consider galaxies for which the geometrical parameters can be kinematically determined is needlessly strict , and that rotation curves could in principle be derived for the lower inclination galaxies by using additional information , such as the axis ratios of the optical or hi  disks .",
    "however , in these cases , the best one can do is assume a _",
    "constant _ inclination .",
    "this will then ignore intrinsic inclination changes ( due to , e.g. , the presence of warps ) , which can strongly affect the derived rotation velocities : an estimate which is only a few degrees off at these low inclinations readily leads to spurious rotation velocities . to illustrate this , at an inclination of @xmath27 , a @xmath28 uncertainty , equivalent to a 3 percent uncertainty in the axial ratio , leads to a 25 percent uncertainty in the deprojected rotation velocity .",
    "furthermore , as discussed earlier , at low inclinations random or streaming motions can be as important as the _ projected _ rotation velocity and these will therefore severely affect the resulting rotation curve .    in the following , we will limit ourselves to the subsample of galaxies indicated in table  [ table1 ] , i.e. , all high - inclination things galaxies ( @xmath29 ) that are dominated by rotation , and , in addition , ngc 6946 , leading to a total sample size of 19 galaxies . in our analysis we will use the natural - weighted things data sets .",
    "the robust weighting does give a higher angular resolution , but at a decreased column density sensitivity .",
    "we found that the small loss in resolution due to the use of the natural - weighted data is more than compensated for by the increased column density sensitivity and , hence , increased usable area of the velocity fields .",
    "we did apply neither residual - scaling corrections , nor primary beam corrections ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for not using these corrections is that for the construction of our velocity fields ( described in the next section ) , we need a constant noise level throughout each galaxy s data cube .",
    "primary beam corrections introduce a noise and flux scaling dependent on distance to the pointing center .",
    "residual - scaling , in essence , artificially decreases the noise in the data cubes in order to produce correct flux densities .",
    "all velocities mentioned in this paper are heliocentric using the optical velocity definition .",
    "hi  rotation curves are most often derived from velocity fields . a velocity field aims to give a compact and accurate `` short - hand '' description of the dynamics of a galaxy by assigning a `` typical '' velocity to every spatial position .",
    "that is , for every position one uses the velocity that most accurately represents the circular motion of the bulk of the quiescent component of the gas as it moves around the center of the galaxy . in an ideal case ( quiescent , purely rotating disk , infinite resolution , intermediate inclination )",
    "this velocity corresponds to the velocity associated with the peak emission in the velocity profile .    in practice , however , the observed velocity profiles are affected by several systematic effects .",
    "these can be divided into effects inherent to the observations themselves , and those due to physical processes within the galaxy .",
    "the first category , instrumental and observational effects , is especially important in lower resolution observations . here",
    "the effect of the relatively large beam ( compared to the size of the galaxy ) causes asymmetric velocity profiles , with the long tail always pointing towards the systemic velocity .",
    "this is known as `` beam smearing '' .",
    "generally , one attempts to correct for this by choosing a typical velocity close to the maximum velocity ( i.e.  furthest away from the systemic velocity ) found in the velocity profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when left uncorrected , these resolution - related effects ( including finite velocity resolution ) always _ lower _ the apparent velocity .    the second category is due to physical processes within the galaxy which cause non - circular motions .",
    "these will show up as deviations both towards and away from the systemic velocity . for our galaxies , this is discussed extensively in accompanying papers by @xcite and @xcite .    to minimize the impact these effects can have ,",
    "different methods to construct velocity fields have been used in the past ( discussed below ) .",
    "the things observations have high enough spatial and velocity resolutions that the resolution effects are no longer a problem ( cf .",
    "[ beamsmear ] ) ; they also give us a detailed enough view of the small - scale movements of the hi  within the galaxies to enable us to quantify the non - circular motions .",
    "nevertheless , each method determines the `` typical '' velocity in a slightly different way , and it is worth exploring these to quantify their impact on the final results .    in principle , our data are of high enough quality that ( barring large non - circular motions ) the velocity of the peak emission in a profile is representative of the total rotational motion . the most direct way to create a velocity field is therefore to simply determine the velocity at which this peak occurs .",
    "@xcite derive these velocity fields in their study of the distribution of brightness temperatures within galaxy disks .",
    "for our purposes , these velocity fields are less suited , due to the decreased signal - to - noise in the outer parts of the galaxies and their smaller usable areas .",
    "as mentioned , in the following we briefly discuss alternative methods most commonly used to construct velocity fields , list their pros and cons , and present our favored method .",
    "a practical comparison of the outcomes of the various methods is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : diffvelfi1]-[fig : profiles2 ] and discussed in more detail below as well as in sect .  3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "* first - moment or intensity - weighted mean velocity : * one of the most well - known and widely - used methods involves taking the first moment or intensity - weighted mean along the velocity axis in the data cube .",
    "the procedure is straightforward , but has the disadvantage that , if the velocity distributions are not symmetric , the `` typical '' velocities are biased towards the longest tail of the velocity profile . also , to avoid noise at outlying velocity values affecting the mean",
    ", one needs to carefully identify the regions with significant emission in the data cube and use only those areas when constructing the velocity field .",
    "this method is the one most commonly implemented in astronomical software .    * peak velocity fields : * using the velocity where the hi  profile flux peaks has the great advantage that it is totally independent from assumptions on profile shapes .",
    "a disadvantage is that as the profile peak value decreases the velocity values become more and more affected by noise .",
    "the peak velocity field is therefore best used in regions of high signal - to - noise .    * gaussian profiles : * an alternative is to fit single gaussian functions to the velocity profiles .",
    "the velocity of the peak of the gaussian profile is then taken to be the velocity field value .",
    "this method is less sensitive to noise and ( moderate ) asymmetries in the profiles than the first - moment method , but can still suffer from biased velocities if the asymmetries are strong or if multiple components are present .",
    "the single gaussian fit method is best used in cases where the instrumental resolution is comparable to the typical width of the profiles .",
    "many of the `` classical '' hi  rotation curve studies from the 1970s and 1980s fall in this category , and used this method to derive rotation curves .",
    "* multiple gaussian profiles : * a logical extension is to fit multiple gaussian functions to the velocity profiles . in many cases , however , the narrow width of the hi  profiles combined with limited velocity resolution yields only a relatively small number of independent profile data points with sufficiently high signal - to - noise .",
    "_ simultaneous _ fits with two or more gaussian functions can in these case become sensitive to the choice of initial values , or have more free parameters than data points .",
    "a careful fine - tuning is in any case needed to provide optimum fits .",
    "an additional uncertainty is how to decide which of the components represents the true rotation velocity , and which one characterizes non - circular , random motions ( induced by , e.g. , star formation or spiral arms ) .",
    "as stated , these uncertainties apply to _ simultaneous _ fitting of multiple gaussian functions .",
    "an alternative method is to optimally fit a single gaussian function to the profile , subtract it , and subsequently make a second gaussian fit to the residual profile .",
    "a robust application of this method is presented in @xcite .",
    "this method is remarkably effective in separating random motions from the average rotation velocity ( or ` bulk ' velocity , to use the terminology from @xcite ) .",
    "* hermite @xmath30 polynomials : * a robust way to minimize the number of components is to include in the fitting function a prescription of the typical asymmetry encountered .",
    "a convenient function to use for this purpose is a _ gauss - hermite polynomial _ that includes an @xmath30 ( skewness ) term ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the hermite method has already been applied successfully to derive rotation curves of early - type galaxies in @xcite , and we will use it as our primary method to derive velocity fields . we do not include an additional @xmath31 term in the fit , which would provide a measure of the kurtosis of the profile ( i.e. , whether the profile is `` fatter '' or more `` pinched '' than a gaussian function ) .",
    "attempts to include an @xmath31 term show that , for the purposes of determining a velocity field , this leads to diminishing returns : the fits become less stable and need increasingly fine - tuned initial estimates . for high signal - to - noise profiles , the velocities derived using the hermit profile will be close to those as derived from the peak - velocity fields .",
    "one could therefore argue that the latter are therefore preferable , as they are model - independent .",
    "however , in low signal - to - noise regions the hermite velocity field results are more stable as more data points ( from neighboring channels ) are used to minimize the effects of the noise .",
    "we therefore prefer to use the hermite velocity fields .",
    "we illustrate the various methods for two representative galaxies .",
    "the first is ngc 2403 ( sect .",
    "3.2 , fig .",
    "[ fig : diffvelfi1 ] ) , which is dominated by rotation , and where most of the asymmetric profiles are associated with streaming motions along the spiral arms .",
    "the second example is the dwarf galaxy ic 2574 ( sect .",

    "the absolute differences between the hermite velocity field and the gaussian and first - moment velocity fields are larger than 10 km s@xmath12 for only a small fraction of the area . for the peak velocity field",
    "the difference with the hermite field is consistent with pure noise ( mostly caused by the lower signal - to - noise of the peak velocity field ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles1 ] shows an example of an asymmetric profile in ngc 2403 , together with the values for the typical velocity , again derived using the methods described above . shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : profiles2 ] are the rotation curves derived from the respective velocity fields , using otherwise identical assumptions and methods ( cf .",
    "any difference is thus entirely due to the manner in which the velocity field was derived .",
    "the curve based on the hermite velocity field systematically shows the highest rotation velocities and agrees best with the peak velocity field curve .",
    "the curves based on the gaussian and first - moment fields are progressively more affected : the latter curve systematically underestimates the rotation velocity by @xmath8 km s@xmath12 over the inner half of the disk .",
    "the bulk velocity field curve is also consistent with the hermite field rotation curve , but with a larger scatter .",
    "a second example is ic 2574 , where the velocity field is clearly affected by non - circular , random motions ( cf .",
    "these are clearly visible as `` kinks '' in the iso - velocity contours in all of the hermite , gaussian , first - moment and peak velocity fields shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffvelfi2 ] .",
    "it is clear that before a rotation curve can be derived some correction for the non - circular motions must first be made .",

    "[ fig : profiles1 ] . the resulting `` bulk '' velocity field ,",
    "showing the rotational part of the kinematics , is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffvelfi2 ] .",
    "though noisier than the other velocity fields , the kinks have largely disappeared , and the velocity field is consistent with simple solid - body rotation .",
    "the resulting bulk rotation curve also differs significantly from those derived from the uncorrected velocity field as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles2 ] .",
    "further analysis shows that in our sample only ngc 2366 and ic 2574 are significantly affected by these random motions and they are therefore the only two galaxies where the bulk velocity field differs significantly from the hermite velocity field @xcite .",
    "for these two galaxies we will in the rest of this paper use the latter .",
    "for the other galaxies the differences are negligible and we will use the hermite velocity fields .",
    "the things data are extremely well resolved .",
    "for example , the ratio of galaxy size to beam size for ngc 2403 is @xmath32 350:1 .",
    "nevertheless , some galaxies , including ngc 2403 , show steep increases in velocity in their inner parts , and despite the high resolution , these small radii could potentially still be affected by beam smearing .",
    "we quantify this effect by constructing two model data cubes using the groningen image processing system ( gipsy ; @xcite ) task galmod .",
    "this task takes an input rotation curve , radial hidistribution , inclination and position angle , as well as hi  scale height and velocity dispersion and creates a model data cube at arbitrarily high resolution by distributing a large number of hi``clouds '' through this data cube using the input parameters as probability distributions .",
    "this cube can then be `` observed '' , e.g. , by smoothing it to a lower resolution , and be used to construct velocity fields , derive rotation curves , etc .    to make the model galaxies as realistic as possible",
    ", we adopt the hidistribution and average inclination and position angle of ngc 2403 .",
    "we assume a velocity dispersion of 8 @xmath33 , and a vertical ( gaussian ) scale height of 100 pc .",
    "none of these assumptions critically affect the results . for the input rotation curves we adopt two extreme versions of the observed ngc 2403 rotation curve . for the first model we assume a steep linear rise to 130 @xmath33  ( the maximum rotation velocity of ngc 2403 ) within 1 kpc ( 65@xmath34 ) , and a flat 130 @xmath33  rotation curve outside 1 kpc .",
    "the second model is identical , except that it rises to its maximum rotation velocity within 0.5 kpc ( 33@xmath34 ) ( compare these with the observed rotation curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2403_comp ] , and indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamsmear ] ) .",
    "the resulting model cubes were smoothed to a resolution of @xmath35 ( the natural - weighted beam size for the ngc 2403 observations ; cf .",
    "@xcite ) and a channel spacing of 5.2 @xmath33  was adopted .",
    "the resulting `` observed '' cubes were then used to construct hermite velocity fields and rotation curves were derived ( cf .",
    "[ derivevelfie ] and [ deriverotcur ] ) .",
    "we compare the derived curves with the respective input models in fig .",

    "though we did calculate the cube for the entire radial extent of our pseudo - ngc 2403 , we only show the inner portions of the rotation curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : beamsmear ] to focus on the rising part of these curves .",
    "it is clear that beam smearing is not a serious problem , with most of the curves differing by less than 1 @xmath33  from the input model .",

    ", this demonstrates that resolution effects such as beam smearing have no significant effect on the things data .      as mentioned before",
    ", we use data sets without primary - beam and residual - scaling corrections as we need the original noise properties of the data to perform the profile fitting . for each galaxy",
    ", hermite @xmath30 polynomials were fitted to all velocity profiles with the gipsy task xgaufit .    to ensure high - quality velocity fields , we only retain profiles with fitted intensity maxima higher than @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the average noise in the line - free velocity channels in the relevant cube ) and where the equivalent gaussian dispersion of the fit is larger than the channel separation ( see @xcite for the noise values and channel separations ) . to objectively remove a small number of noise pixels admitted by these filter criteria , we use the integrated hi  column density map as an additional mask and only retain the fits at positions where the total flux value in the integrated hi  map is higher than @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the noise in the integrated hi  map . for independent channels ( as is the case with the things cubes ) @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of channels with signal contributing to each pixel .",
    "these various steps result in objectively defined hermite velocity fields that form the basis of our analysis .",

    "is described using a set of concentric rings , each with their own inclination @xmath46 , position angle pa , systemic velocity @xmath47 , center position @xmath48 and rotation velocity @xmath49 . assuming that the gas moves in purely circular orbits , one can then describe the line - of - sight velocity for any position @xmath50 on a ring with radius @xmath51 as @xmath52 in this equation",

    "the parameters are varied using a least - squares algorithm until an optimum fit with the velocity field is achieved .",
    "we use the gipsy task rotcur to make the tilted - ring fits and derive the rotation curves . as positions closer to the major axis carry more rotational information than positions near the minor axis , we use a @xmath55 weighting for all fits . in defining the radii and widths of the rings we sample the rotation curve at a rate of two points per synthesized beam width .    in this section",
    "we give a general description of the procedure we used .",
    "detailed , and more technical , descriptions of the derivation of individual rotation curves are given in the appendix .",
    "for each galaxy we firstly fix the position of the dynamical center to that determined in the analysis of @xcite who used the same data . for completeness , the resulting coordinates of the dynamical centers are given in table  [ bigtable ] . after fixing the center position ,",
    "an additional rotcur run is used to determine @xmath47 ( with pa and @xmath46 still left as free parameters ) . in general the systemic velocity",
    "has very little uncertainty associated with it .",
    "the adopted values are given in table  [ bigtable ] .",
    "after fixing the central position and systemic velocity , rotcur is run once more with pa and @xmath46 as free parameters .",
    "the trends of @xmath46 and ( especially ) pa with radius are generally well - defined , varying smoothly with radius and exhibiting little scatter .",
    "of the two fitting parameters , the pa is very stable , and any small perturbations in its value result in only second - order changes in the rotation curve . in some cases , small - scale fluctuations in the inclination",
    "these are mostly caused by effects such as streaming motions along spiral arms which the fitting program tries to `` compensate '' for by changing @xmath46 .    to prevent these small spurious changes and to retrieve the underlying `` bulk '' rotation",
    ", we describe the pa and @xmath46 distributions by slightly smoothed radial distributions that ignore these small - scale `` wiggles '' . a simple box - car smoothing with a kernel width of 3 or 5 data points was used in most cases .",
    "this only affects the point - to - point scatter of the @xmath46 and pa values for the few galaxies where these wiggles are relevant , and does not affect the resolution of their radial distributions . with pa and @xmath46 fixed using these radial distributions , we derive the final rotation curve .",
    "we also construct model velocity fields based on the tilted - ring models , as well as corresponding residual velocity fields containing the non - circular component .",
    "the inclination wiggles described above , as caused by streaming motions , affect only a small part of the area of the velocity field for a small number of galaxies and do not affect the shape of the rotation curves in any critical way .",
    "our treatment of the @xmath46 and pa distributions assigns the dominant non - circular motions to the residual velocity field .",
    "an explicit comparison between the rotcur residual velocity fields and the results from a full rigorous treatment of the non - circular motions is made in @xcite and shows that the above procedure is justified .",
    "care was also taken to double - check that the solutions produced using our pa and @xmath46 distributions were self - consistent ( i.e. , we checked whether running rotcur again with only pa and @xmath46 free , and @xmath49 fixed , yielded pa and @xmath46 distributions consistent with our input values ) .",
    "the method just described assumes galaxies are azimuthally symmetric .",
    "however , asymmetries in the disk , or lopsidedness , can introduce intrinsic differences . to quantify the uncertainties introduced by this , we derive separate fits to the rotation curves of the approaching and receding sides of the galaxies .",
    "a final issue is the definition of the final uncertainties in the rotation curves .",
    "unfortunately , there is no consensus in the literature on how to quantify these .",
    "sometimes the formal @xmath56 @xmath57-fit uncertainty in @xmath49 is used . however , by their nature , these uncertainties are much smaller than the dispersion of individual velocity values found along a tilted ring .",
    "this dispersion is , therefore , also commonly used as an alternative definition , as it is more representative of the physical uncertainties than the formal fit error . for the ngc 3198 rotation curve ( discussed in sect .",
    "4.8 ) , for example , the average @xmath58 fit error is @xmath59 times smaller than the average dispersion along the rings . using only formal @xmath57-based error bars",
    "thus severely underestimates the true `` physical '' uncertainty .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty is formed by possible differences in rotation velocity between the approaching and receding sides .",
    "@xcite assumes that the differences between the rotation curves derived for the entire disk and those for either the approaching or receding side represent a @xmath60 difference , and defines a pseudo-@xmath56 uncertainty due to asymmetries , as one fourth of the difference between the approaching and receding side velocities .",
    "though this is only an assumption , we follow this convention and define the uncertainties in the rotation curves as the quadratic addition of the dispersions found along the rings and the pseudo-@xmath56 uncertainties due to asymmetries between approaching and receding sides .",
    "note that this is a very conservative definition : the difference in velocity between approaching and receding sides will already be partly reflected in the dispersion found along a ring .",
    "the uncertainties in the rotation velocities presented here thus give a realistic , and possibly even conservative , picture of the error budget of our rotation curve determinations .",
    "detailed descriptions of the data as well as the derivation of the tilted ring models and the resulting rotation curves of individual galaxies are given in the appendix . in this section",
    "we compare these results with previous determinations of the various hi rotation curves from the literature .",

    "this would suggest that the very inner @xmath123  maximum and steep drop are associated with the central component , whereas the subsequent steep rise and gradual drop are associated with the dust ring , and therefore do not reflect stellar population changes .",
    "we therefore also investigate a model where the two components each have a radially constant @xmath123 . using fig .",
    "[ fig : n7331_prof ] , we find that @xmath217 and @xmath254 are good estimates for the inner and outer disks , respectively .",
    "these fits are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7331_2curve ] .",
    "we then find that both iso and nfw models result in better fits .",
    "ngc 7331 is therefore the one galaxy in our sample where the @xmath133-@xmath123  relation clearly fails .",
    "note that for the fixed @xmath123  case , the kroupa models yield much better fits than the diet - salpeter ones .      the surface brightness profiles of ngc 7793 are shown in fig .  [",

    "the 2mass @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath115 profiles can be traced out to @xmath289 ; the 3.6 @xmath0 m profile can be traced out to @xmath199  the entire extent of the hi  disk .",
    "the 2mass profiles show a clear and sudden increase in surface brightness in the very inner part .",
    "this is the signature of the nuclear star cluster in ngc 7793 @xcite .",
    "its photometric and dynamical importance has already become negligible at the radius of the innermost point of the rotation curve .",
    "the extent of the irac 3.6 @xmath0 m profile equals that of the hi  data , and no exponential extrapolations were necessary .",
    "the @xmath133 profile shows a small but consistent color gradient , translating in a gradient in @xmath123  from @xmath290 in the inner parts , to @xmath291 at the outermost radius where the 2mass colors were deemed reliable . beyond this radius",
    "we assume a constant @xmath292 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7793_prof ] .",
    "the rotation curve mass models are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7793_1curve ] . for the fixed @xmath123  model",
    "both iso and nfw models give roughly equal results : neither is fully able to describe the observed rotation curve ( independent of imf ) .",
    "the `` bump '' in the rotation curve within @xmath293 kpc , and its resemblance with the shape of the stellar disk rotation curve suggests that the inner part of ngc 7793 could be close to maximum disk . the iso model with @xmath123  as a free parameter does indeed prefer @xmath123  values that are slightly higher than the fixed @xmath123  diet - salpeter value . for the nfw model , releasing @xmath123  has forced its value down to unrealistic values in order to accommodate the more concentrated dark halo .    as remarked earlier ( sect .",
    "[ sect:7793 ] ) , the possible observed decline in the outer rotation curve is uncertain .",
    "we tested whether this decline could cause the low quality of the fits by repeating the analysis with radii @xmath294 kpc excluded .",
    "this analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n7793_2curve ] . for the fixed @xmath123  case",
    "the situation does not change much .",
    "the biggest improvement is achieved for the iso model with a free @xmath123 .",
    "the preferred value is close to maximum disk , with a significantly better overall fit .",

    "the largest variation in @xmath303 is about 0.1 dex ( a factor 1.3 ) in the very inner parts of the luminous galaxies , and quickly becomes totally negligible towards lower luminosities and large radii .",
    "there are a few things to note in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdom ] .",
    "firstly , galaxies with the highest absolute luminosity are in general the least dominated by dark matter .",
    "this is not only true globally , but also locally : even at the outermost radii , the baryons in these luminous galaxies are more dominant than in the least luminous galaxies .",
    "secondly , while the most luminous galaxies show a clear gradient in @xmath305 with radius ( with the outer radii becoming progressively more dark - matter - dominated ) , this trend is less pronounced in the low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "the latter indeed are dominated by dark matter at all radii .",
    "these results are robust against any particular choice of dark matter model , but only depend on the values of @xmath123 .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the distribution of @xmath306 for the case of @xmath123  as a free parameter ( i.e.  as determined by the dynamics , rather than the photometry ) . in these cases the results are not entirely independent of the halo model assumed , as the choice of model plays a role in determining @xmath123during the fitting .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdom ] show @xmath305 for the best - fitting iso and nfw @xmath123  values , respectively .",
    "the trends discussed above are still present in the fixed @xmath123  iso case , but they become confused for the nfw model . the latter is most likely a reflection of the nfw model being an inappropriate fitting function for at least some of the galaxies .    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95    = 0.95      an overview of the derived @xmath123  values of the main disk components of our sample galaxies is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : colourml ] . here",
    "we plot the photometric ( fixed ) and dynamical ( free ) values for @xmath123  against the colors and luminosities of the galaxies .",
    "the left - hand panels show the fixed and free @xmath123  values of the disks for both the iso and nfw model plotted against @xmath133 color .",
    "we also distinghuish between our two choices for the imf . also shown is the predicted relation between @xmath134  and color ( eqs .  4 and 5 ) , again for both the diet - salpeter and the kroupa imfs .",
    "by definition , the photometric @xmath123  values follow their respective relations .",
    "the small scatter is caused by the color gradients present in these galaxies which make the photometric @xmath123differ slightly from those with a constant @xmath123  as a function of radius .    in general , we see that the diet - salpeter curve defines an approximate upper limit to the distribution of the majority of the best fit values ( apart from a few obviously discrepant cases ) . accepting the best fit ( free ) @xmath123  values at face value , this would suggest that a diet - salpeter @xmath123  analysis overestimates the disk masses slightly . indeed , the kroupa fixed @xmath123  values seem to be a better match to the free @xmath123  values .",
    "alternative explanations could be effects of star formation history , or unexpectedly large contamination by pahs , agbs or hot dust in the 3.6 @xmath0 m maps , though it is likely that the imf plays the dominant role .",
    "future rigorous population synthesis modeling should shed light on some of these issues .",
    "the nfw @xmath123values tend to be lower than the iso values , which is to be expected due to the intrinsically steeper mass distribution of the nfw halo .",
    "we compare the distributions of the @xmath123  values in fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] .",
    "the diet - salpeter fixed @xmath123  values are offset towards somewhat higher values compared to the iso free @xmath123distribution .",
    "the kroupa fixed @xmath123  values are a much better match , as already suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : colourml ] .",
    "the distribution for the nfw model is less well - defined , and has a larger number of galaxies at very low @xmath123  values .",
    "these are the cases where @xmath123had to be set to zero manually , due to the preferred negative @xmath123values . the smaller spread of the @xmath123  values for the iso case , and the somewhat better agreement with the predicted values , especially for the kroupa imf results , could be taken as tentative supporting evidence that the iso model is superior in describing the properties of real galaxies .    in general",
    ", it is remarkable that despite our empirical and , from the point of view of a population synthesis expert , undoubtedly rudimentary modeling of the stellar mass - to - light ratios , the best - fit dynamical @xmath123  values lie so close to the photometric @xmath123  values . the photometric @xmath123  values `` do nt know '' anything about dynamics , and the best - fitting dynamical values , whereas the best - fitting @xmath123ratios have no _ a priori _ reason to stay close to the predicted photometric stellar population values .",
    "it is therefore gratifying to see that the calculated @xmath123  agree with the fitted @xmath123  to such a good degree .    plotting @xmath123  against luminosity ( right - hand panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : colourml ] ) we see that the brightest galaxies have the highest @xmath123  ratios . these large values are not found for the lower luminosity galaxies .    the one galaxy that shows a different behavior is ddo 154 .",
    "its predicted population - synthesis @xmath123  value is low , but the @xmath123  values derived from the mass - modeling do not agree and are much higher .",
    "this discrepancy can neither be due to the data quality ( things observed galaxies at identical resolution and sensitivity ) , nor due to large non - circular motions , as ddo 154 has a well - behaved , `` quiescent '' velocity field @xcite .",
    "one can interpret this result at face value , and assume that ddo 154 does have a massive disk . this would , however , put it out of odds with the rest of the sample , and imply a substantial change in the nature of galaxy disks towards low luminosities .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that for galaxies like ddo 154 the disk is not massive enough to have a noticeable effect on the total rotation curve .",
    "there would then be no small deviations induced by , e.g. , spiral arms , and the dynamics are everywhere dominated by the dark matter .",
    "the fitting program is then unable to derive a sensible value for @xmath123 .",
    "obviously , a larger sample of high - resolution observations of galaxies fainter than @xmath307 should then show the same trend .",
    "a similar , but slightly more prosaic , explanation , is related to the fact that ddo 154 has the lowest surface brightness disk in 3.6 @xmath0 m in our sample .",
    "the surface brightness profile is only measured out to @xmath93 ( @xmath130 kpc ) , while the rotation curve extends out to @xmath243 ( @xmath308 kpc ) .",
    "this means that most of the disk rotation curve is based on a smooth exponential extrapolation of the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "if the underlying ( undetected ) disk does indeed induce small wiggles in the observed rotation curve , then these will not be matched by the disk rotation curve ( as derived from the exponential extrapolation ) , and this will throw the fitting program off track .",
    "tests of replacing the observed disk rotation curve of a few of the other things galaxies with their smooth exponential disk equivalents , indicate that this does indeed affect the derived @xmath123  values , but the effects are not unambiguous enough to conclusively show that this is the single cause of what is happening in the ddo 154 mass modeling .",
    "deeper observations of the stellar disk should help pinpoint the exact cause of the @xmath123  discrepancy .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show the dynamical importance of the stellar disk as a function of luminosity .",
    "we plot the ratio of the maximum rotation velocity of the disk ( assuming the photometric @xmath123ratios and using both imf assumptions ) and the total rotation velocity at the radius where the maximum disk velocity occurs ( @xmath309 for an exponential disk ) .",
    "it is clear that disks become dynamically less and less important with decreasing luminosity .",
    "note that a similar plot of the importance of the disk versus luminosity for the case of free @xmath123  ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) does not show such a trend as clearly , but here the result may be diluted by the effects just described .    in a previous analysis , @xcite used measurements of stellar velocity dispersions in a number of early - type disk galaxies to estimate the dynamical contribution of the disk .",
    "he found for the magnitude range he investigated ( @xmath310 ) that the ratio of maximum rotation velocity of the stellar disk and total rotation velocity at the corresponding radius ( generally @xmath309 ) is @xmath311 .",
    "these results are also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .    over the same range in magnitude",
    "we find that @xmath312 for the fixed diet - salpeter @xmath123  case and @xmath313 for the kroupa imf fits .",
    "the latter is in reasonable agreement with the @xcite values .",
    "the free @xmath123  results yield @xmath314 .    in order to gauge whether our data show a preference for one particular imf , we compare in fig .",
    "[ imf ] the goodness - of - fit values for the fixed @xmath123  models ( for both the diet - salpeter and kroupa imfs ) and the iso and nfw halos as a function of luminosity .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from this comparison .",
    "firstly , the choice of imf does not influence the goodness of fit for low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "this is of course to be expected as the dynamics of these galaxies are dominated by the dark matter component .",
    "secondly , for the intermediate luminosity galaxies the iso models prefer a diet - salpeter imf , while the nfw models prefer a kroupa imf .",
    "this is also easily understood , as the nfw halo has a steeper mass - density profile ( a steeper inner rotation curve ) which leaves less room for the luminous component and results in lower optimal @xmath123  values .",
    "thirdly , for the high - luminosity galaxies , the kroupa imf is much preferred over the diet - salpeter fits .",
    "this reflects the fact that the diet - salpeter fits result in disks that are close to the maximum allowed by the dynamics .",
    "a small change in the @xmath123  value can then result in a large difference in the quality of the fit .",
    "the kroupa imf with its lower @xmath123  values is more stable against these effects , as it still allows a dark matter component in the inner parts which can compensate for any small @xmath123uncertainties .",
    "the photometrically determined , fixed @xmath123  values therefore do not allow us to choose a particular imf , without making additional assumptions on the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "it would thus be interesting to independently confirm the @xmath109  values of the disks with measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions within the things disks , and thus calibrate our @xmath109  measurements .      in sect .",
    "[ sec : genprop ] we used the derived @xmath123  values in combination with our rotation curves to derive the ratio of baryonic to dark matter as a function of radius . in a similar way we can derive the rotation curves of the dark matter halos : @xmath315 where again we are , strictly speaking , dealing with the circular rotation velocities of test particles in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the velocities of the gas and stars have been calculated using the three - dimensional mass distributions as described in sect .",
    "5.1 and 5.2 .",
    "we again assume spherical halos .",
    "@xcite show that these empirical halo rotation curves , for a realistic range of @xmath109  values , yield halo dark matter densities about @xmath316 percent lower than expected from @xmath1cdm simulations .",
    "one interesting aspect of their conclusions is that they are based on the _ outer _",
    "( @xmath317 kpc ) parts of the rotation curves , i.e. , those regions where the usual concerns about resolution or slope of the curve are not relevant .    here",
    "we repeat the analysis of @xcite for our current sample .",
    "we derive the halo rotation curves for our galaxies assuming the photometric ( fixed ) @xmath123  values for both imf assumptions . the resulting diet - salpeter imf logarithmic halo rotation curves are shown in fig .  [ fig : halocurve ] , where we have divided the galaxies into three bins according to their luminosity .",
    "the kroupa imf halo rotation curves are very similar and we will not show them here , though we do discuss their implications below .    for each luminosity bin we show the original data , as well as the observed average halo rotation velocity , binned in steps of 0.25 dex in radius . following @xcite , we only consider radii @xmath317 kpc , so as not to confuse the issue with potential systematic effects in the determination of the very inner slope . over",
    "the radial range observed , the average velocities behave very nearly like a power - law .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halocurve ] are two nfw model rotation curves with @xmath147 velocity values chosen so they encompass the observed data set .",
    "the lowest velocity model has @xmath154 @xmath33 , and is representative of the dwarf galaxies in our sample . on the high - luminosity end of the range",
    "we show a model with @xmath318 @xmath33 .",
    "galaxies with intermediate luminosities or masses will have curves lying between these two extremes .",
    "the corresponding @xmath150-parameters of these curves have been chosen to be consistent with current @xmath1cdm cosmological models ( cf .",
    "5.3.1 and 7.4.2 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : halocurve ] we also show the fit to the halo rotation velocities derived for the @xmath319 galaxies in the @xcite sample , assuming their photometrically derived @xmath109  ratios .",
    "they find that over the radial range observed , the halo rotation velocity can best be describe by @xmath320 . to compare this with cdm predictions , @xcite subjected a large number of nfw halo models to observational selection effects and found that the average halo rotation velocity in a @xmath1cdm universe is best described as @xmath321 ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halocurve ] ) . from this",
    "they conclude that the empirically determined densities of dark matter halos are @xmath316 percent lower than those predicted by cdm simulations .",
    "we first consider the lowest luminosity bin with @xmath322 . over the observed radial range the average diet - salpeter halo velocities can be described by a power - law @xmath323 ( kroupa : @xmath324 ) .",
    "the normalization is thus 0.24 ( 0.15 ) dex ( a factor 1.7 to 1.4 ) lower than the empirical one derived by @xcite and 0.41 ( 0.31 ) ( a factor 2.5 to 2.0 ) dex lower than the average velocity for cdm halos as derived in that paper .",
    "the latter value was , however , derived for a much larger range in mass than considered in this low - luminosity sub - sample . nevertheless , even if we compare with the value found at 1 kpc for a @xmath154 @xmath33  halo ( which should be more typical for the galaxies considered here ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : halocurve ] ) , we still find a velocity that is @xmath325 ( 0.15 ) dex lower than predicted . only at @xmath326 kpc",
    "do we start finding some agreement between the empirical and simulated velocities .",
    "the situation is similar for the intermediate luminosity galaxies with @xmath327 .",
    "the average diet - salpeter derived halo velocity can be described as @xmath328 ( kroupa : @xmath329 ) , virtually indistinguishable from the @xcite fit .",
    "the same conclusions thus hold here : the velocity normalization is about 0.21 ( 0.16 ) dex ( a factor 1.6 to 1.4 ) too low compared to average cdm halos , or about 0.25 ( 0.20 ) dex ( a factor 1.8 to 1.6 ) lower than that of a @xmath330 @xmath33  halo ( which has a value @xmath331 at @xmath332 kpc ) .",
    "this difference in normalization is illustrated by the fact that in fig .",
    "[ fig : halocurve ] the inner three observed average data points overlap with those of the @xmath154 @xmath33  halo , even though the average maximum rotation velocity of the galaxies in this sub - sample is @xmath333 @xmath33 .    at the high - luminosity end of the sample , @xmath334 ,",
    "all observed average data points are now within the range described by nfw halos , but there is still a normalization discrepancy for the diet - salpeter case .",
    "the data extend further out in radius and are best described by a power - law fit @xmath335 ( kroupa : @xmath336 ) .",
    "the slope is thus more shallow than in the other luminosity bins , perhaps indicating we are starting to see the velocity turn - over or flattening expected in the iso and nfw models .",
    "if we look at halos with @xmath147 values between 200 and 300 @xmath33 , we find intercept values at @xmath332 kpc between @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "this discrepancy is therefore less pronounced than for the lower luminosity bins , but still amounts to @xmath339 dex , or a factor 1.3 difference , for the diet - salpeter case . for the kroupa case ,",
    "the intercepts agree , but note that the slope of the average halo rotation curve is much shallower than the nfw model curves .",

    "comparison of the fits derived here can tell us which of the dark matter models , if any , is preferred .",
    "note that with the sampling of our velocity fields of two points per beam , the individual rotation curve data points are not entirely independent .",

    "more relevant for our discussion are therefore the _ differences _ between the _ reduced _ @xmath57 values , which tell us the relative merits of any particular model . in this respect , the @xmath57-_statistic _ should not be confused with the @xmath57-_test_. the statistic simply quantifies the sum of the absolute differences between the observed velocities and the best - fitting model velocities , expressed in terms of the measurement uncertainties and normalized using the effective number of data points .",
    "this reduced @xmath57 is here only used as a proxy for the average excess velocity per data point .    in determining the halo parameters and the corresponding uncertainties the rotmas software uses a simple least - squares procedure .",
    "the uncertainties in the rotation velocity should therefore be reflected in the uncertainties in the halo parameters , and our definition of the rotation velocity uncertainties could thus potentially have an impact on the values we derive .",
    "we evaluated the effect of adopting a different definition for the uncertainties ( as discussed in sect .",

    "there is therefore no evidence from things that we have probed the `` edge '' of a dark matter halo .",
    "* we fit nfw and iso models to our rotation curves using our best estimates for @xmath123 .",
    "we find that for galaxies @xmath381 both models statistically fit equally well .",
    "note , however , that for the 11 galaxies in this high - luminosity bin , the fixed @xmath123  diet - salpeter nfw fits result in 4 galaxies with unphysical ( severely inconsistent with cdm ) halo parameters .",

    "the core - dominated iso model fits significantly better than the nfw model ( and the fixed @xmath123  nfw fits yield 4 out of 5 galaxies with unphysical halo parameters independent of imf assumption ) .",

    "<S> we present rotation curves of 19 galaxies from things , the hi nearby galaxy survey . </S>",
    "<S> the high spatial and velocity resolution of things make these the highest quality hi  rotation curves available to date for a large sample of nearby galaxies , spanning a wide range of hi  masses and luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the high quality of the data allows us to derive the geometrical and dynamical parameters using hi data alone . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find any declining rotation curves unambiguously associated with a cut - off in the mass distribution out to the last measured point . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation curves are combined with 3.6 @xmath0 m data from sings ( _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxies survey ) to construct mass models . </S>",
    "<S> our best - fit , dynamical disk masses , derived from the rotation curves , are in good agreement with photometric disk masses derived from the 3.6 @xmath0 m images in combination with stellar population synthesis arguments and two different assumptions for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . </S>",
    "<S> we test the cold dark matter - motivated cusp model , and the observationally motivated central density core model and find that ( independent of imf ) for massive , disk - dominated galaxies , all halo models fit apparently equally well ; for low - mass galaxies , however , a core - dominated halo is clearly preferred over a cuspy halo . </S>",
    "<S> the empirically derived densities of the dark matter halos of the late - type galaxies in our sample are half of what is predicted by cdm simulations , again independent of the assumed imf . </S>"
