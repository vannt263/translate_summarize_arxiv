    "recently experimentally observed intermittent structure of produced  particle distributions in high energy collisions @xcite and frustrating situation in the theoretical description of the phenomena @xcite makes it crucial in the choice of the multiple production process model .    in this note",
    "we study the problem for soft hadronic interaction within the low constituent number model @xcite with the nontrivial gluon string hadronization ( the zip  model ) @xcite .",
    "such an approach allows one to obtain reasonable multiple hadron production properties in addition to a successful description @xcite of the total and elastic cross  sections within a single pomeron exchange picture .",
    "the reason we expect to obtain intermittent patterns in this model is two  fold .",
    "first , the standard quark string hadronization stage seems to be a real intermittency source phase @xcite , and the model , below considered , mostly deals with this regime .",
    "second , additional multi  particle short  range correlations in our model due to the zip  mechanism lead to an enhancement of intermittent behavior of particle distribution .",
    "following ref.@xcite intermittency refers to a scaling law ,    @xmath0 of the scaled factorial moments ,    @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 cells of particle phase space .",
    "@xmath3 , called the intermittency index , shows a strength of intermittent behavior . here",
    "the brackets denote averaging over events and @xmath4 is multiplicity in the chosen cell .",
    "we are to show here that contrary to the popular two  chain models ( fritiof @xcite and two  chain dpm @xcite ) our zip  model due to intrinsic positive multiple correlations leads to intermittent behavior being compatible with the na22 experimental observations @xcite after count of bose ",
    "einstein interference ( sec.3 ) .",
    "the brief description of the zip  model is given in sec.2 .",
    "in the zip  model @xcite we consider a soft hadronic interaction picture consisting of several stages .",
    "a hadron wave function is created far from the interaction point .",
    "the number of projectile constituents taking part in a soft hadron interaction is restricted by the valence component only .",
    "the constituent momenta are not changed during the interaction .",
    "an interaction goes via color exchanges , and despite their dynamical properties the colored objects rush out of the interaction region and stretch strings .",
    "the resulting strings can be divided into classes by their end ",
    "point color `` charges '' ( @xmath5 representations ) .",
    "the gluon ( adjoint ) string dominates in the final state .",
    "the fragmentation of a gluon string differs from that of two independent quark strings causing the required properties of soft processes .",
    "the gluon string splits into two quark ones by the certain zip  mechanism  locally via creation of the so  called zip  antizip pairs .",
    "each zip is a certain junction between a gluon and two quark strings , switching strings from the adjoint representation of @xmath5 group into the fundamental one and vice versa .",
    "these massless objects are created uniformly along the gluon string with a certain @xmath6probability ( just the same way as @xmath7 are produced along the usual quark string with @xmath8probability @xcite ) .    the very moment",
    "a @xmath9pair is produced , two very short quark strings appear out of the gluon string .",
    "they can be naturally treated as ordinary ones with ends stretched by zip and antizip instead of quark and antiquark .",
    "we suppose that zip and antizip from the adjacent @xmath9 annihilate .",
    "thus after this `` unzipping '' process , we obtain finally almost the same two long quark strings as in the standard approach .",
    "the created quark strings break down via the usual @xmath10 creation @xcite .",
    "quarks and antiquarks from adjacent @xmath11pairs meet each other and form the so  called primary fragments .",
    "what is important here is that @xmath9pair and @xmath10pair creation processes overlap in the space ",
    "time leading to substantially positive correlations that are seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "certainly , such a collective effect can lead to quite an intermittent behavior for soft hadronic process .",
    "the above  mentioned scheme has been described in ref.@xcite at the level of primary fragments , while the main details of the monte  carlo version are outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "we ve used the same string breaking algorithm both for the `` zip '' part and for a quark string one . to go from primary fragments to real hadrons",
    "we ve used an available herwig 4.6 @xcite cluster ",
    "hadron converter without any modifications besides the processing of high mass cluster that we suppose to decay as ordinary quark string .",
    "in fig.1 we present results for various order scaled factorial moments in rapidity space obtained by our mc ",
    "generator for @xmath12 ( dashed line ) as well as for @xmath13 ( dotted line ) .",
    "the latter corresponds to the case of two independent quark strings , i.e. to the dpm  like two  chain model .",
    "we see that in fact our model develops higher magnitudes for all the moments considered than the usual two  chain model .",
    "note also that switching on of the zip  mechanism gives quite a visible positive change for high order factorial moments especially and , what is important , for small rapidity bins as can be seen in fig.1d .",
    "the reason for such an increase of factorial moment magnitude in our model is connected to the fact that short quark strings stretched by @xmath9 are created in pairs , so particles out of these quark string pairs are to be correlated .",
    "this indicates an existence of genuine multi ",
    "particle fluctuations at a gluon string hadronization stage .",
    "nevertheless , it is seen that the zip ",
    "model by itself does not describe the experiment ( error bars in fig.1 ) @xcite despite the evident excess over the independent two  chain version .",
    "meanwhile , it has been shown recently @xcite that bose ",
    "einstein ( be ) interference plays an important role in the intermittency effect in addition to a mechanism causing the underlying power  law behavior .    indeed , when taking into account be interference in the simplest possible way ( using the corresponding lund routine @xcite with default parameters ) we obtain the remarkable agreement with the data for various order scaled factorial moments , as shown in fig.1 by solid lines .    the corresponding intermittency indices computed in our model for various values of gluon string splitting relative parameter @xmath14 are listed in tab.1 .",
    "although the low order moment behavior seems to be almost the same for different @xmath15 , the high order moments ( especially , @xmath16 ) are consistent with experiment for the certain @xmath17 contrary to the two independent quark string case .",
    "it is worth noticing that the pure be ",
    "effect by itself is insufficient to agree with the experimental magnitudes of the moments considered .    from the obtained results we conclude that our zip  approach combined with bose ",
    "einstein interference is able to fit the observed intermittent behavior in soft hadronic processes .",
