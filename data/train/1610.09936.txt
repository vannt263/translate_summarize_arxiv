    "the dynamics of crime and the impact of social relations on the increase of violence has been the object of study in several areas such as social sciences @xcite , criminology @xcite , computing @xcite , economics @xcite and physics @xcite .",
    "when , in the 1950s , naroll and bertalanffy @xcite utilized the concept of allometry  a term originally coined in the field of biology to describe scaling laws , _",
    "e.g. _ , the relationship between mass and metabolic rate of organisms @xcite  so as to adapt it to the social context , a particularly promising line of research was opened , which today arouses interest of scientists from wide - ranging areas @xcite .",
    "more recently , bettencourt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite revealed that allometric relationships are statistically present in many aspects of city infrastructures and dynamics .",
    "in particular , they observed a characteristic superlinear relation between the number of serious crimes and the resident population in the united states ( us ) cities which clearly denotes the an intricate social mechanism behind the dynamics of violence .",
    "more recently , melo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provided strong quantitative evidence showing that an entirely similar behavior can also be observed in brazil .    despite the importance of the results presented in the aforementioned studies , their impacts on urban planning , more specifically , on the development of public safety policies ,",
    "are limited due to its purely descriptive nature , which prevents a deeper understanding of the organic causes leading to such a disproportional behavior . in this way ,",
    "a microdynamical approach based on the interactions between local neighborhoods within metropolitan areas certainly represents a more realist view to the problem .",
    "our research motivation is aimed at elucidating issues related to the understanding of the impacts of the influence of social relations on crime . in criminology ,",
    "the role of urban space and its social relations has been previously emphasized to explain the origin of crime @xcite .",
    "particularly , the theory of routine activities , proposed by cohen and felson @xcite , states that crimes , more specifically property crimes , such as robbery and theft , occur by the convergence of the routines of an offender , motivated to commit a crime , and an unprotected victim . in this context , can we explain the occurrence of crimes in different areas of the city based on the current population present in the corresponding urban sub - clusters ?",
    "is this effective population equally important for any type of crime ?",
    "how can we systematically delimit the boundaries of these local neighborhoods so that the social influence is accounted for in a consistent way ?    in order to answer these questions , we used actual georeferenced data of crimes committed , and of resident and floating populations for census tracts in the city of fortaleza , brazil .",
    "the concept of resident population has been widely used to understand the effects that the growth of major cities has on social and environmental indicators .",
    "in particular , bettencourt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the number of homicides scales superlinearly with the population of cities in the us .",
    "subsequently , melo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite confirmed this behaviour for brazilian cities , but also demonstrated that suicides scale sublinearly with their resident populations .",
    "additionally , oliveira _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found a superlinear allometric relationship between the resident population and @xmath0 emissions ; this study also raised the issue that the allometric exponents may undergo endogenous trends depending on the respective definition of urban agglomerates .",
    "regarding the floating population , it takes into account the complex dynamics of urban mobility , _ i.e. _ , it has a transient characteristic within the city . to measure social influence quantitatively in urban sub - clusters",
    ", we delimited their boundaries beyond the mere administrative divisions , _ e.g. _ division by neighborhoods or census tracts , by using the city clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "this model defines these boundaries by population density and the level of commuting between areas of the city .    in the present study",
    ", we identified that the incidence of property crimes has a superlinear allometric relationship , with the floating population in certain areas of the city .",
    "this result implies that the increased flow of people in a particular area of the city will take place at the cost of a proportionally greater rate of property crime happening in the region .",
    "more important , this superlinear behavior at the subscale of the city neighborhood provides a plausible explanation for the allometry of serious crimes found in @xcite . precisely , the floating population being systematically larger that the resident one should lead to the disproportional behavior observed for serious crimes and ( resident ) population at the city scale .",
    "we also found a superlinear allometric relationship between the number of crimes of disturbing the peace and the resident population .",
    "this result shows that the effect of social influence must be adequately correlated with resident or floating population , depending on the type of crime considered .",
    "in order to quantify the effects of the social influence on the police calls within a large metropolis , we used three georeferenced datasets for the brazilian city of fortaleza : from the first , we obtain the _ resident population _ ( pop ) , defined by the number of residents per _ census tract _  administrative territorial unit established for the purposes of cadastral control  and provided by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ( ibge ) @xcite . in all",
    ", fortaleza has 3018 census tracts , with approximately 2,400,000 residents , spread over an area of 314 square kilometers ( @xmath1 ) in year 2010 . from the second",
    ", we estimate the _ floating population _ ( flo ) for each census tract through a flow network built on data of the bus system provided by the fortaleza s city hall for the year 2015 @xcite .",
    "flo was measured by the number of people who pass through a census tract in one day .",
    "the city of fortaleza has 2034 buses circulating along 359 bus lines serving approximately 700,000 people who use the city s mass transit system on a daily basis . in the case of fortaleza",
    ", buses still represent the main means of public transportation .",
    "the process of generating of the flow network will be detailed in the supporting information ( see the s1 appendix ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the _ crime dataset _ from the integrated coordination office of public safety operations ( ciops ) @xcite , provides the geographic locations of 81,911 calls to the `` 190 '' ( phone number for emergency ) service about property crimes ( pc ) and 53,849 calls to the same service about disturbing the peace ( dp ) .",
    "these calls were made to police between august 2005 and july 2007 .",
    "the color maps show in figs [ fig1](a)-[fig1](d ) provide the local density in logarithmic scale of pop , flo , dp and pc , respectively , for the city of fortaleza .",
    "we can clearly identify stronger correlations between pop and dp as well as between flo and pc .",
    "in special , there is an evident higher incidence of hot spots in ( b ) and ( d ) than in ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "also , at the downtown area , highlighted by black circles on each map , the high density of flo is compatible with the high rates of pc rate , while low pop densities seem to explain the low frequency of dp complaints .    ) .",
    "( b ) the floating population ( flo ) by @xmath1 .",
    "( c ) the disturbing the peace ( dp ) complaints by @xmath1 .",
    "( d ) the property crimes ( pc ) by @xmath1 .",
    "the black circle highlights the downtown area of the city .",
    "this region has a low density of residents and disturbing the peace calls , and is dense in the flow of people and property crimes.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in spite of seeming trivial to suggest that there are correlations between pop and dp , as well as flo and pc from the density maps shown in fig [ fig1 ] , the respective scattering plots show uncorrelated behaviors ( fig [ fig2 ] ) . actually , we conjecture that such correlations exist indeed .",
    "the most census tracts have a small area , sometimes the size of one city block , and it is likely that such an agglomeration scale is insufficient to capture the correlations and therefore reveal the impact of social influence on dp and pc . based on this hypothesis , we considered coarse - grainning these spatial properties of fortaleza into clusters , using the census tracts grid as a maximal resolution base .",
    "this clustering aims to find the boundaries of the flow of people and the residential areas of the city .",
    "to define the boundaries beyond administrative delineations , we considered the notion of spatial continuity through the aggregation of census tracts that are near one another using the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) @xcite .",
    "the cca constructs the population boundaries of an urban area considering two parameters , namely , a population density threshold , @xmath2 , and a distance threshold , @xmath3 . for the @xmath4 census tract ,",
    "the population density @xmath5 is located in its geometric center ; if @xmath6 , then the @xmath4 census tract is considered populated .",
    "the length @xmath3 represents a cutoff distance between census tracts to consider them as spatially contiguous , _ i.e. _ , all of the nearest neighboring census tracts that are at distances smaller than @xmath3 are clustered .",
    "hence , a cluster made by the cca is defined by populated areas within a distance less than @xmath3 , as seen schematically in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "previous studies @xcite have demonstrated that the results produced by the cca can be weakly dependent on @xmath2 and @xmath3 for some range of parameter values . here @xmath3 will be quantified in meters ( m ) and @xmath2 in inhabitants by @xmath1 .    ; in contrast , the gray polygons can not be clustered ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "( a ) the red dot represents the geometric center of the @xmath4 census tract and the black circle with radius @xmath3 seeks neighbors belonging to the same cluster .",
    "( b)-(c ) the same search operation is made for the other census tracts and is done until there are no more neighbors within the radius of operation .",
    "( d ) the algorithm finishes running and the cluster is found.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    although the algorithm begins collating an arbitrary seed census tract , it does not produce distinct clusters when varying this seed ; the two factors that are responsible for clustering behavior are the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 .    in order to determine the effect of the parameterization on the value of the exponent @xmath8",
    ", we sought a range within the parameters where @xmath8 has low sensitivity to this variation .",
    "fig [ fig4 ] shows the behavior of exponent @xmath8 in function of the variation of the cca parameters .",
    "as shown in figs [ fig4]a and [ fig4]b , the value of the parameter @xmath8 obtained from the least - square regressions to the data of pop against dp remains practically insensitive to the cca parameters in the range @xmath9 , regardless of the values of @xmath2 adopted in the estimation process .",
    "moreover , the resulting average @xmath10 provides strong evidence to support a superlinear type of relation between these two variables .",
    "an entirely similar behavior can be observed for flo against dp , but now the exponent @xmath8 remains practically invariant within the range @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting average value of @xmath12 also indicates the presence of a superlinear allometric relation .     by varying the parameters of the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . *",
    "( a ) the variation of @xmath8 in correlation between the resident population ( pop ) and the disturbing the peace ( dp ) complaints is illustrated ; ( b ) the variation is illustrated for correlations between the floating population ( flo ) and the property crimes ( pc ) .",
    "both in ( a ) and ( b ) , the x - axis represents @xmath3 , and this parameter was varied from 0 to 800 meters ( m ) ( moment when the largest cluster consumes nearly the entire city ) ; exponent @xmath8 is shown on the y - axis .",
    "the colors of the lines represent the variation of the parameter @xmath2 , which corresponds to the resident population density in ( a ) and the floating population density in ( b ) ; this parameter was varied from 1000 to 8000 .",
    "it was not necessary to use values larger than 8000 because many census tracts start being discarded and the cca can no longer form clusters .",
    "the graphs also show red dashed lines ; between these lines is highlighted the range where , regardless of the parameterization , the exponent @xmath8 has smaller ranges of variation . finally , the dotted black line highlights exponent @xmath15 , in which the relationship between variables is isometric , in both graphs the exponent oscillates to low values of @xmath3 ; in ( a ) , the relationship is superlinear starting at @xmath16 m ; however in ( b ) , superlinearity appears at @xmath17 m.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    at this point , it is necessary to determine a suitable criteria for selecting an adequate value of the parameter @xmath2 . while lower values of @xmath3 lead to the formation of a larger number of cca clusters , reduced values of @xmath2 tend to eliminate fewer census tracts from the map , thereby including a larger portion of in the population under analysis . here",
    "we propose that a proper choice of @xmath2 would be associated with a more homogeneous spatial distribution of the population @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we seek for cca clusters whose areas should scale as close to isometrically as possible with the population data , namely , as @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the population , @xmath21 is the area ( are ) of the clusters @xmath1 , and @xmath22 is constant .     when varying the city clustering algorithm ( cca ) parameters @xmath13 and @xmath23 . *",

    "the line colors represent the variation of the parameter @xmath2.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in order to follow the procedure previously described , we obtain from fig [ fig5]a that @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspond to the pair of cca parameter values leading to the closest to isometric relation found between are and pop . in the case of are and flo , the values are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as depicted in fig [ fig5]b ( see the s2 appendix ) .",
    "the census tracts were grouped , using the cca , by pop and flo ( fig [ fig6 ] ) . in the fig [ fig6]a ,",
    "the division achieved by pop is illustrated ; the city was divided using @xmath3 = 270 m and @xmath2 = 6000 resident people per @xmath1 . in the fig [ fig6]b",
    ", we show the division achieved by flo , using @xmath3 = 320 m and @xmath2 = 2000 floating people per @xmath1 per day .",
    "we emphasize that there are bigger gaps in the pop map ( fig [ fig6]a ) than in the flo map ( fig [ fig6]b ) .",
    "the reason for such behavior is the fact that fortaleza has commercial regions , _",
    "i.e. _ , regions where there is not a large presence of residents . regarding floating people ,",
    "there are people moving practically throughout the entire city , both in commercial areas and in residential areas .    .",

    "in this paper , we define a methodology to understand the impact that society has on calls to the police finding the boundaries of social influence in a large metropolis through the analysis of georeferenced datasets for the city of fortaleza , brazil .",
    "we used the cca , a clustering algorithm , in order to define intracity clusters , _",
    "i.e. _ spatially contiguous populated areas within a cutoff distance .",
    "the volume of social influence was measured in various localities of the city based on the presence of residents and the flow of passers - by through the census tracts . unlike intercity studies , where social influence was measured only by the presence of residents , we propose that , within a city , urban mobility should be considered to understand the dynamics of social indicators , such as criminal activity .",
    "our results show that the incidence of property crimes grows superlinearly as a power law with the floating population , with allometric exponent @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the increase of the flow of people in a region of the city leads to a disproportionally higher number of property this type of crime .",
    "our results are in agreement with the routine activities hypothesis @xcite , which states that a crime occurs by the convergence of the routines of three agents , specifically : the presence of a motivated offender , the presence of an unprotected victim , and the absence of a guardian able to prevent the transgression . in other words , the regions with higher incidence of floating population potentiate the meeting of the routines of these three agents .",
    "this result is in clear contrast with the incidence of crimes related with peace disturbance , where an allometric relation can also be detected , but with the resident population ( pop ) instead .",
    "we hope the our results could shed some light on the understanding of crimes inside urban areas , as well as assist eventual violence mitigation policies .",
    "the findings described in this paper bring alternatives to implementing innovative practices to decision makers within cities .",
    "the most obvious of these relates to the fact that , by showing the correlation of different types of crimes with the home population but also with the floating population , it is also clear that the police force allocation strategies should be implemented via the analysis of different cluster configurations that depend on the type of crime .",
    "for example , the allocation of community policing , more appropriate to resolve conflicts that potentially can emerge from the disturbance of people s peace , must be planned from a cluster configuration and a hot spot analysis that were produced from the perspective of the density of resident population .",
    "when it is necessary to establish a policy for allocating a uniformed police in order to mitigate crimes against property , the allocation of the police force must be conducted from an analysis from the movement of people .",
    "in addition to these police allocation strategies , the results described herein provide important indicators for the creation of public policies for land use and environmental design in general . work in this line has been developed such as in ref .",
    "@xcite where a framework has been proposed to associate the physical spaces and the feeling of safety as well as @xcite , who launched the environmental criminology putting focus of criminological study on environmental or context factors that can influence criminal activity .",
    "these include space ( geography ) , time , law , offender , and target or victim .",
    "these five components are a necessary and sufficient condition , for without one , the other four , even together , will not constitute a criminal incident .",
    "the discovery demonstrated in the article that there is a superlinear relationship between crime and population ( resident or floating ) in clusters within cities strengthens the claim that changes in urban form can lead to reduced crime as discussed in ref .",
    "the urban mobility system of a large city is composed of several interconnected networks , such as subway , bus , bicycle , taxicab , and private vehicle networks .",
    "buses are the main means of transportation for the most inhabitants in the city of fortaleza , being used by about 700,000 people daily .",
    "taking this fact into account , we assumed that the urban mobility within the city can be represented by the use of the bus system .",
    "thus , the trajectories of bus users will be used to infer the floating population at the different points of the city .    in order to understand the people flow throughout the city",
    ", we used four spatio - temporal datasets related to fortaleza s bus network , which are : bus stops ; bus lines ; gps tracking of vehicles ; and ticket card validation .",
    "all datasets refer to a normal business day , in fact , the march 11th , 2015 - a wednesday . in total , fortaleza has 4,783 bus stops served by 2,034 buses along 359 different routes . the integrated transportation model adopted by fortaleza city hall , called _ bilhete nico _ , allows the registred users to make a bus transfer anywhere in the city , as long as it is within two hours since the last validation of their ticket card .",
    "the validation process is understood as the act of the user swiping his / her ticket card at the turnstile on the bus or at the bus terminal .",
    "usually , such procedure happens at the beginning of the trip , since the turnstile is close to the bus entrance in fortaleza . in this context",
    ", we are able to define the origin - destination matrix ( odm ) for fortaleza s bus network through the following hypoteses @xcite : we can assume that an user s origin point could be represented by the earliest of all first daily ticket validations in the interval of two weeks before march 11th , as well as an user s destination point could also be represented by the earliest of all last daily ticket validations in the interval of one month before march 11th , bearing in mind that an user could have different destination points along the week , _",
    "i.e. _ we have to analyze mondays with mondays , tuesdays with tuesdays , and so on .",
    "hence , we estimated the origin - destination pair for about 40% of the bus users representing the overall behavior of the urban mobility in fortaleza .",
    "finally , we supposed that the trajectories of bus users are defined by the composition of routes of the buses took by them between their origin - destination pair @xcite . in this context , we describe the trajectories of bus users as a directed graph @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the set of vertices @xmath40 and edges @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "an edge @xmath41 between the vertices @xmath42 and @xmath43 is defined by the ordered pair @xmath44 . in our approach ,",
    "the vertices represent bus stops and the edges represent the demand of bus users between two consecutive bus stops . for each vertice @xmath42",
    ", we defined a weighted function @xmath45 as the sum of the users passing by @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we calculated the floating population as the sum of all @xmath45 within each census tracts .",
    "in the main text , we observed the emergence of a trend toward an isometric relation between the populations ( pop and flo ) of the cca clusters and their respective areas ( are ) .",
    "the fig [ s2_appendix_fig2 ] shows the closest relations to an isometric behavior for both cases .",
    "the cca parameters used to define the clusters were @xmath46 and @xmath25 for the pop case , illustrated in fig [ s2_appendix_fig2]a , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the flo case ( fig [ s2_appendix_fig2]b ) .    ) . *",
