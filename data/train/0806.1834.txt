    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission has been of special interest in wireless communication for the past one decade .",
    "the alamouti code @xcite for two transmit antennas , due to its orthogonality properties , allows a low complexity maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoder .",
    "this scheme paved the way for generalized orthogonal stbcs @xcite .",
    "such codes allow the transmitted symbols to be decoupled from one another and single - symbol ml decoding is achieved over quasi - static rayleigh fading channels .",
    "another aspect of these codes is that they achieve the maximum diversity gain for any number of transmit and receive antennas and for any arbitrary complex constellations .",
    "unfortunately , for more than two antennas , rate 1 codes can not be constructed using orthogonal designs .    with a view of increasing the transmission rate , quasi - orthogonal designs ( qods ) were proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , these codes come at the price of a smaller diversity gain and are also double symbol decodable for 4 antennas . as an improvement ,",
    "coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciods ) were proposed @xcite .",
    "these codes have the same transmission rate as qods but additionally enjoy full diversity while being single symbol decodable for certain complex constellations . but none of the above class of codes is _ full - rate _ , where an stbc is said to be of full - rate if its rate in complex symbols per channel use is equal to the minimum of the number of transmit and the receive antennas .    full - rate , full - diversity stbcs are of prime importance in systems like wimax .",
    "low - decoding complexity , full - rate stbcs have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite for @xmath1 and in @xcite for @xmath0 mimo systems .",
    "these codes allow a simplified ml decoding when compared with codes from division algebras @xcite,@xcite which are not amenable for low decoding complexity though they offer full - rate .",
    "the fast decodable code proposed in @xcite for @xmath0 systems , which we call the bhv code , outperforms the best known djabba code only at low snrs while allowing a reduction in the ml decoding complexity .",
    "the bhv code does not have full - diversity as it is based on the quasi orthogonal design for 4 antennas , when all the symbols are take values from one constellation .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new stbc for @xmath2 mimo transmission .",
    "our code is based on the coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciods ) proposed in @xcite ( defined in section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "the major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * our code has a decoding complexity of the order of @xmath3 , for all complex constellations , where @xmath4 is the size of the signal constellation , whereas the djabba code has the corresponding complexity of order @xmath5 and the bhv code has order @xmath6 ( @xmath3 for square qam constellations - though this has not been claimed in @xcite ) . *",
    "our code has a better cer ( codeword error rate ) performance than the best code in the djabba family due to a higher coding gain for qam constellations . *",
    "our code outperforms the bhv code for qam constellations due to its higher diversity gain . * combining the above , it can be seen that when qam constellations are used , our code is the best among all known codes for @xmath7 systems .",

    "this implies that it is important to first ensure full diversity of the stbc and then try to maximize the coding gain .    for the @xmath2 mimo system ,",
    "the objective is to design a code that is full - rate , i.e transmits 2 symbols per channel use , has full diversity and allows simplified ml decoding .",

    "all the codes perform similarly at low and medium snr .",
    "but at high snr , the full diversity property of the djabba code and the proposed code enables them to outperform the bhv code .",
    "in fact , our code slightly outperforms the djabba code at high snr .",

    "<S> this paper proposes a low decoding complexity , full - diversity and full - rate space - time block code ( stbc ) for 4 transmit and 2 receive ( @xmath0 ) multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems . for such systems , </S>",
    "<S> the best code known is the djabba code and recently , biglieri , hong and viterbo have proposed another stbc ( bhv code ) which has lower decoding complexity than djabba but does not have full - diversity like the djabba code . </S>",
    "<S> the code proposed in this paper has the same decoding complexity as the bhv code for square qam constellations but has full - diversity as well . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the best code in the djabba family of codes , our code has lower decoding complexity , a better coding gain and hence a better error performance as well . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results confirming these are presented . </S>"
