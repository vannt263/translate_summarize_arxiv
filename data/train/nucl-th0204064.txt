    "relativistic nuclear collisions can produce matter in which chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "one possible consequence of the restoration and the subsequent re - breaking of chiral symmetry is the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc )  transient regions in which the average chiral order parameter differs from its value in the surrounding vacuum @xcite .",
    "previous efforts to describe dcc signals have focused on pion production .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , kapusta and i have explored the possible influence of dcc on kaon production , inspired by the explanation due to kapusta and wong @xcite of measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryon enhancement @xcite at @xmath3  @xmath4  gev at the cern sps in terms of the production of many small dcc regions within individual collision events . if true , ref .",
    "@xcite implies that the evolution of the condensate can have a significant effect on _ strange _ particle production .",
    "the importance of strange degrees of freedom in describing chiral restoration has been long appreciated @xcite , but simulations of the three flavor linear sigma model had suggested that strange kaon fields are much less important than the pion fields  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data demand that we explore without prejudice techniques for measuring kaon fluctuations .    a further implication of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the dcc regions must be rather small , with a size of about @xmath5  fm .",
    "such a size is consistent with predictions based on dynamical simulations of the two flavor linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the dcc search for anomalous event structure in neutral and charged pions by the wa98 collaboration at the sps has revealed no evidence of large dcc `` domains '' @xcite .",
    "note that i loosely use the word `` domain '' to refer to spatial regions in which the condensate is somehow coherent .",
    "i stress that no thermodynamically stable domain structures are expected in theoretical descriptions of dcc .",
    "in this paper i study kaon isospin fluctuations in the presence of many small dcc . in the next section",
    "i discuss how dcc may lead to kaon fluctuations .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , i compute the probability distribution that describe the dcc contribution to these fluctuations and combine the dcc fluctuations with a contribution from a random thermal background .",
    "pion fluctuations due to many small dcc have been addressed by amado and lu @xcite and chow and cohen @xcite . here",
    "we focus on kaon fluctuations ; pion as well as kaon results are presented in ref .  @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 i assess robust statistical observables that can be used to measure the impact of many small dcc at rhic and lhc . in sec .",
    "5 i present work in progress on event generator simulations to understand the magnitude and centrality dependence of the statistical observables in the absence of dcc .",
    "in particular , i obtain a dynamic isospin fluctuation observable analogous to the dynamic charge observable used to measure net charge fluctuations at rhic @xcite . of the quantities",
    "considered , this observable isolates the dcc effect from other sources of fluctuations best .",
    "to illustrate how a strange dcc can form , let us first consider qcd with only up and down quark flavors .",
    "equilibrium high temperature qcd respects chiral symmetry if the quarks are taken to be massless .",
    "this symmetry is broken below @xmath6  mev by the formation of a chiral condensate @xmath7 that is a scalar isopin singlet .",
    "however , chiral symmetry implies that @xmath8 is degenerate with a pseudoscalar isospin triplet of fields with the same quantum numbers as the pions . in reality ,",
    "chiral symmetry is only approximate and the 140  mev pion mass is different from the @xmath9  mev mass of the leading sigma candidate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lattice calculations exhibit a dramatic drop of @xmath10 near @xmath11 at finite quark masses .",
    "a dcc can form when a heavy ion collision produces a high energy density quark - gluon system that then rapidly expands and cools through the critical temperature .",
    "such a system can initially break chiral symmetry along one of the pion directions , but must then evolve to the @xmath12 vacuum by radiating pions .",
    "a single coherent dcc radiates a fraction @xmath13 of neutral pions compared to the total that satisfies the probability distribution @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "such isospin fluctuations constitute the primary signal for dcc formation in the pion sector .",
    "the enhancement of baryon - antibaryon pair production is a secondary effect due to the relation between baryon number and the topology of the pion condensate field @xcite .",
    "this two flavor idealization only applies if the strange quark mass @xmath15 can be taken to be infinite .",
    "alternatively , if i take @xmath16 , then the chiral condensate would be an up - down - strange symmetric scalar field .",
    "the more realistic case of @xmath17  mev is between these extremes , so that @xmath18 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath19 is highly uncertain since it depends on the sigma mass together with the @xmath20 and @xmath21 masses and the @xmath22 mixing angle @xcite .",
    "a disoriented condensate can evolve by radiating @xmath23 and @xmath21 mesons , with the neutral pion fraction satisfying ( 1 ) .",
    "randrup and schffner - bielich find that the kaon fluctuations from a single large dcc satisfy @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the condensate fluctuations can now produce strange baryon pairs @xcite .",
    "linear sigma model simulations indicate that pion fluctuations dominate three - flavor dcc behavior , while the fraction of energy imparted to kaon fluctuations is very small due to the kaons larger mass . on the other hand ,",
    "domain formation may be induced by other mechanisms such as kaon condensation at high baryon density @xcite , bubble formation @xcite or decay of the polyakov loop condensate @xcite .",
    "why does the dcc s size matter ?",
    "pion measurements in individual collision events can distinguish dcc isospin fluctuations from a thermal background only if the disoriented region is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "dcc can then be the dominant source of pions at low transverse momenta , since @xmath26 for a coherent region of size @xmath27 .",
    "experiments focusing on low @xmath28 can study neutral and charged pion fluctuations @xcite , wavelet @xcite and hbt signals @xcite to extract detailed information .",
    "in contrast , for small domains ( @xmath29  fm @xcite ) dcc signals are hidden by fluctuations due to ordinary incoherent production mechanisms .",
    "this holds even if many such regions are produced per event .",
    "dcc mesons from small regions may have momenta of a few hundred mev , nearer the @xmath30 mean value .",
    "different regions would not add coherently to alter hbt , nor would their small spatial structures affect wavelet analysis .",
    "importantly , baryon pair enhancement @xcite is substantial only if there are many small incoherent regions .",
    "the large winding numbers that produce baryon - antibaryon pairs require many small regions with random relative orientations of the pion field . to describe strange antibaryon enhancement , kapusta and wong assume roughly 100 dcc regions of size roughly @xmath5  fm @xcite .",
    "topological models of baryon - antibaryon pair production successfully describe @xmath31 and hadronic collision data @xcite .",
    "the connection of dcc to topological pair production was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also @xcite .    to compute the distribution of kaons due to many small dcc regions ,",
    "define @xmath32 .",
    "to an excellent approximation the number of neutral kaons is equal to twice the number of short - lived neutral kaons @xmath33 which are more readily measurable in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the fraction @xmath34 ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "the statistical distribution in @xmath34 for a single domain is @xmath35 .",

    "results for pions are presented in @xcite .    in a more realistic scenario",
    "some kaons will come from the decay or realignment of dcc domains and some will come from more conventional sources .",
    "i shall refer to the latter as random or thermal , even though that may be a bit of a misnomer .",
    "what i mean by random or thermal is that the distribution of kaons from non - dcc sources is @xmath42 \\ , .\\ ] ] for a completely random source the width @xmath43 is related to the total number @xmath44 of non - dcc kaons by @xmath45    now let us assume that a fraction @xmath46 of all kaons come from non - dcc sources and the remaining fraction @xmath47 come from @xmath39 independent dcc domains . letting @xmath48 denote the total number of kaons , i have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "this change in the width may be positive or negative , depending on the parameters .",
    "detection of small incoherent dcc regions in high energy heavy ion collisions requires a statistical analysis in the @xmath53 or the @xmath0 channels .",
    "neutral mesons can be detected by the decays @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "the analysis we propose in @xcite is sensitive to correlations due to isospin fluctuations .",
    "we expect these correlations to vary when dcc regions increase in abundance or size as centrality , ion - mass number @xmath4 , or beam energy are changed .",
    "correlation results combined with other signals , such as baryon enhancement @xcite , can be used to build a circumstantial case for dcc production .",
    "correlations of @xmath53 and @xmath56 can be determined by measuring the robust isospin covariance , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the number of neutral and charged mesons .",
    "i take @xmath60 and @xmath61 for pion fluctuations and @xmath62 and @xmath63 for kaon fluctuations .",
    "the ratio ( 9 ) has two features that are convenient for experimental determination .",
    "first , this observable is independent of detection efficiency as are the `` robust '' ratios discussed in @xcite .",
    "robust observables are useful for dcc studies because charged and neutral particles are identified using very different techniques and , consequently , are detected with different efficiency .",
    "observe that robust quantities are not affected by the unobserved @xmath64 , since the strong - interaction eigenstates @xmath65 and @xmath66 are a superposition @xmath64 and @xmath67 until their decay well outside the collision region .",
    "second , since ( 9 ) is obtained from a statistical analysis , individual @xmath68 or @xmath55 need not be fully reconstructed in each event .",
    "this feature is crucial because it would be extraordinarily difficult  if not impossible  to reconstruct a low momentum @xmath69 in heavy ion collisions except on a statistical basis .",
    "next i define robust variance @xmath70 where @xmath71 or 0 . to see why ( 10 ) is robust , denote the probability of detecting each meson @xmath72 and the probability of missing it @xmath73 . for a binomial distribution",
    "the average number of measured particles is @xmath74 while the average square is @xmath75 .",
    "i then find @xmath76 independent of @xmath72 @xcite ; the proof that ( 9 ) is robust is similar .",
    "the ratios ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are strictly robust only if the efficiency @xmath72 is independent of multiplicity . further properties and advantages of these and",
    "similar quantities are discussed in @xcite .    to study dcc fluctuations",
    "i define the dynamic isospin observable @xmath77 analogous observables have been employed to study net charge fluctuations in particle physics @xcite and were considered in a heavy ion context in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this quantity can be written in terms of @xmath78 to isolate the dynamical isospin fluctuations from other sources of fluctuations , one obtains ( 12 ) by subtracting from ( 13 ) the uncorrelated poisson limit @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , we show in ( 19 ) below that the quantity ( 12 ) depends primarily on the fluctuations of the neutral fraction @xmath34 , while the individual ratios ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) have additional contributions .",
    "i illustrate the effect of dcc on the dynamic isospin fluctuations by writing @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "small fluctuations on @xmath34 or @xmath48 results in the changes @xmath82 i obtain the average @xmath83 here the contribution of the variance of the total number of mesons is @xmath84 and the charge - total covariance is @xmath85 .",
    "dcc formation primarily effects the charge fluctuation contribution , @xmath86 , from ( 15 ) or ( 17 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by ( 9 ) .",
    "using ( 21 ) i get @xmath90 this observable isolates the isospin fluctuations , whereas the individual @xmath91 depend on the fluctuations in total meson number , @xmath92 and @xmath93 as well .",
    "i estimate the effect of dcc on the dynamical fluctuations ( 18 ) using ( 6 ) and ( 8) .",
    "i take @xmath94 for kaons and @xmath95 for pions ; these are the total number of mesons of the indicated kind . for kaons",
    "@xmath96 these quantities can be positive or negative depending on the magnitude of @xmath97 compared to the number of domains per kaon .",
    "in fact the dynamical fluctuation may even be positive for one kind of meson and negative for the other .",
    "let us now discuss work in progress in which abdel - aziz and i use event generators to simulate conventional sources of kaon fluctuations @xcite . in the absence of dcc , @xmath98 and @xmath99 so that ( 19 ) implies @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , incomplete equilibration may result in dynamical correlations in nuclear collisions not described by ( 5 ) .",
    "little is known from @xmath30 experiments about kaon fluctuations .",
    "event generators such as hijing and urqmd models both yield negative values of @xmath101 in pp collisions . hijing simulations of central au+au at 200 @xmath4 gev in the rapidity range @xmath102 yield @xmath103 for 47 @xmath104 and 44 @xmath67 on average @xcite .",
    "the onset of dcc formation can substantially change the value of @xmath101 . to search for this onset",
    "it is useful to study fluctuations as a function of collision centrality .",
    "i use hijing to estimate the influence of conventional collision geometry and dynamics on the centrality dependence .",
    "however , i find that one can understand the hijing results quite simply using the wounded nucleon model . in a multiple collision models such as the wounded nucleon model , one describes a nucleus - nucleus collision as a superposition of m independent nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions .",
    "the robust variance and covariance satisfy @xmath105 where the @xmath106 are coefficients describing the fluctuations in each sub - collision and @xmath107 can equal either @xmath93 or @xmath108 .",
    "the dynamical isospin observable , @xmath109 is independent of the contribution from the fluctuations of @xmath110 . in the wounded nucleon model , @xmath110",
    "is given at each impact parameter by the number of participant nucleons .",
    "in figs .  1 and 2 , i show the kaon covariance ( 9 ) and dynamical isospin observable ( 12 ) as functions of the number of participants @xmath110 computed from 50,000 hijing events for au+au at 200 a@xmath111 in the rapidity range @xmath112 compared to wounded nucleon model calculations ( 20 ) .",
    "the number of participants at impact parameter @xmath113 for a symmetric au+au collision is computed using @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the familiar nuclear thickness function and @xmath116 is the three - parameter fermi nuclear density for au . in fig .  1",
    ", the solid curve is determined using ( 20 ) with a coefficient @xmath117 computed from 50,000 s+s collisions , while the dashed curve is obtained by varying @xmath117 to fit au+au . the hijing results scale roughly as @xmath118 as expected , but the difference from the wounded nucleon model are rather large .",
    "figure 2 shows the dynamical isospin observable as a function of @xmath110 from hijing .",
    "the solid curve is obtained from ( 21 ) with @xmath119 determined from hijing s+s .",
    "i find that the wounded nucleon model is in excellent agreement with hijing , suggesting that the correlations that increase @xmath91 compared to the wounded nucleon model are similar for all kaon charge states .",
    "the agreement of hijing and the wounded nucleon model in fig .  2 is likely due to the following .",
    "first , baryon stopping is unimportant at the high rhic energy .",
    "different numbers of protons and neutrons would alter the isospin balance .",
    "second , high @xmath120 aside , the way hijing describes soft interactions is quite similar to the wounded nucleon model , since it does nt incorporate final state cascading . to understand the effect of cascading",
    ", we are currently studying urqmd collisions @xcite .        to illustrate the possible scenario for the onset of dcc effects ,",
    "i assume that dcc kaons add to the kaons from multiple sub - collisions according to @xmath121 where @xmath97 is the fraction of dcc kaons , @xmath122 is the dcc contribution given by ( 10 ) and @xmath123 is given by ( 21 ) .",
    "i assume that dcc production above an impact parameter @xmath124 exhibits a threshold behavior , @xmath125 $ ] , where @xmath124 and @xmath126 are ad hoc constants . in fig .  4 ,",
    "i show estimates assuming that 10 domains contribute kaons in the range @xmath102 for @xmath127  fm , varying the dcc fraction @xmath126 between 10% and 20% .",
    "note that the dcc contribution to @xmath128 is positive for these values .",
    "reference @xcite argued that the anomalous abundance and transverse momentum distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath129 baryons in central collisions between pb nuclei at 17 @xmath4 gev at the cern sps is evidence that they are produced as topological defects arising from the formation of many domains of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc ) with an average domain size of about 2 fm .",
    "motivated by this interpretation , kapusta and i studied the effect of dcc on the distribution of the fractions of neutral kaons and pions in @xcite .",
    "the dcc pioneers @xcite had hoped that a large percentage of pions might be emitted from just a few big domains , on the order of 5 to 8 fm ( kaons were not considered ) .",
    "such large domains have been ruled out at sps @xcite , but remain possible at rhic .",
    "more conservatively , as the number of domains grow and their average size diminishes , the impression left on the fluctuations in the neutral fraction becomes more subtle and less unique .",
    "for many small domains , statistical measurements of both neutral kaons ( pions ) and charged kaons ( pions ) are needed to observe the rather small isospin fluctuations .",
    "we have identified robust observables for that purpose .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the dynamical isospin observable ( 12 ) is sensitive to dcc but not to thermal or multiple - collision sources of fluctuations , as discussed in the text near eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 21 ) respectively .",
    "while hijing simulations support this conclusion , more work remains .",
    "for example , one can use urqmd to study the effect of final state scattering on this observable .",
    "isospin fluctuations can appear as changes in the magnitude of the dynamical isospin observable as centrality is varied .",
    "we emphasize that similar consequence may follow from any mechanism that produces many small domains that decay to pions and kaons , such as the polyakov loop condensate @xcite .",
