    "recently , candes , romberg and tao observed the surprising fact that it is possible to recover certain discrete functions exactly from vastly incomplete information on their discrete fourier transform @xcite .",
    "the crucial property of these functions is their sparsity with respect to the canonical ( dirac ) basis , i.e. , their ( unknown ) support is very small .",
    "the recovery procedure consists in minimizing the @xmath0-norm of the signal subject to the constraint that the fourier coefficients are matched .",
    "this task is also known as basis pursuit @xcite . since minimizing the total variation norm",
    "can be reformulated as minimizing the @xmath0-norm there are relevant applications in image processing , in particular , computer tomography @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the related problem of reconstructing a sparse trigonometric polynomial from few randomly chosen samples drawn from the continuous uniform distribution on @xmath2^d$ ] . by `` sparse '' we mean that only very few coefficients of the polynomial are non - zero . however , a priori we do not know the support of the coefficients . from a practical viewpoint considering such polynomials can be motivated as follows .",
    "first , trigonometric polynomials with a certain maximal degree model band - limited signals .",
    "secondly , in many cases it seems reasonable that only few coefficients ( with unknown location ) are large .",
    "such a signal can at least be approximated by a sparse one .",
    "we propose to reconstruct the sparse polynomial from its random samples by basis pursuit similarly as in @xcite . from numerical experiments",
    "it is evident that this scheme can indeed reconstruct the polynomial exactly provided the number of samples is large enough with respect to the sparsity . when comparing the number of samples to the assumed maximal degree of the polynomial it turns out that this method may overcome the nyquist rate by far .",
    "thus , the described recovery method is very likely to have high potential for practical applications in signal processing .",
    "we will present two theorems that explain the observed phenomenon .",
    "similar to @xcite the first one estimates the probability of exact reconstruction given an arbitrary sparse trigonometric polynomial .",
    "hence , this can be viewed as a worst case estimate .",
    "our second theorem is more directed towards an avarage case analysis .",
    "it gives a probability estimate for generic polynomials in the sense that the support of the coefficients is modelled as random set .",
    "a result of this type seems to be new .",
    "as one may expect it gives better probability estimates than the first one .",
    "however unexpectly , it relates the problem to a seemingly new and difficult combinatorial problem about set partitions .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to solve this problem in general , and as a consequence we can not yet exploit fully our probability estimate .",
    "we have to leave the combinatorial aspect as an interesting open problem .",
    "we would like to mention some recent related work . in @xcite",
    "candes et al .",
    "study stability aspects of the problem and investigate also recovery from few inner products with random vectors following gaussian distributions and binary distributions . in @xcite some practical examples are presented .",
    "the recovery from gaussian measurements via basis pursuit is also investigated by rudelson and vershynin in @xcite in the context of error correcting codes , while tropp @xcite studies the reconstruction by orthogonal matching pursuit . in @xcite donoho and tsaig",
    "introduce the terminology `` compressed sensing '' for this range of problems and in @xcite probabilistic results concerning basis pursuit are discussed . a randomized sublinear algorithm for reconstructing sparse fourier data",
    "is introduced and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "if the reader is interested in reconstructing not necessarily sparse trigonometric polynomial from random samples we refer to recent work of bass and grchenig @xcite , where probabilistic estimates of related condition numbers are developed .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec_main_results ]",
    "we describe the problem and present our main results . to this end",
    "we also need to introduce some background on set partitions .",
    "section [ sec_proof ] will be devoted to the proofs .",
    "section [ sec_qn ] gives some more information on the combinatorial problem related to our second theorem . in section [ sec_bound ]",

    "@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , there is numerical evidence that the above reconstruction scheme recovers @xmath6 _ exactly _ provided the number of samples is large enough compared to the sparsity .",

    "the reconstruction is exact !",

    "unexpectly , both results involve combinatorial quantities connected to set partitions .",
    "we will spend the next section introducing the necessary notation .",
    "we denote @xmath37:= \\{1,2,\\hdots , n\\}$ ] .",

    "for example @xmath42 consists of @xmath43 clearly , @xmath39 is empty if @xmath44 .",

    "we also need partitions of a different type .",
    "an adjacency is defined to be an occurence of two consecutive integers of @xmath37 $ ] in the same block of a partition .",
    "hereby , consecutive is understood in the circular sense , i.e. , also @xmath49 and @xmath25 are considered consecutive .",

    ", @xmath51 consists of the partitions @xmath52 clearly , @xmath53 is empty .",
    "we remark that it was only very recently that d. knuth @xcite raised the problem of determining the number of partitions in @xmath50 .",
    "we will also need a slight variation of this type of partitions .",
    "let @xmath54 \\times [ m ] = \\{1,\\hdots , k\\ } \\times \\{1,\\hdots , m\\}$ ] for some numbers @xmath55 .",
    "we denote by @xmath56 the set of all partitions of @xmath54 \\times [ m]$ ] such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not contained in the same block for all @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "( so this sort of consecutiveness is _ not _ understood in the circular sense . )",
    "we remark that @xmath61 is the set of all partitions of a @xmath62-element set into @xmath40 subsets ( without any restriction on the type of partition ) .",
    "in particular , the numbers @xmath63 equal the ( ordinary ) stirling numbers @xmath64 of the second kind .",
    "the numbers @xmath65 are called bell numbers @xcite .",
    "now let @xmath66 be a partition in @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "we associate a @xmath72 matrix @xmath73 to the pair @xmath74 by setting @xmath75 then we define @xmath76 to be the number of pairs of partitions @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 such that the rank of @xmath80 equals @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 observe that @xmath83 ( since the @xmath70 s are disjoint ) and similarly @xmath84 .",

    ", the choice of @xmath49 is crucial .",

    "this formulation is similar to the main theorem in @xcite concerned with exact reconstruction in the context of the discrete fourier transform . indeed , setting @xmath121 yields a probability of exact reconstruction of at least @xmath122 provided @xmath123 .",
    "we remark that ( [ pbound0 ] ) of theorem [ thm_main0 ] allows to actually compute precise bounds on the probability of exact reconstruction when the parameters @xmath124 are given explicitly . but clearly , the previous corollary is easier to interpret .",
    "this is the reason why we have given both results .    for our next theorem we model also the set @xmath17^d$ ] of non - vanishing fourier coefficients as random .",
    "so we will not treat arbitrary sparse polynomials , but only `` generic '' ones .",

    "we also introduce @xmath131 as the set of all trigonometric polynomials whose coefficients are supported on @xmath14 .",

    "the reason for not being able to compute ( [ pbound ] ) for arbitrary @xmath49 is due to the fact that we do not have an explicit expression ( or a recursion formula , or a good estimation ) of the numbers @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we were only able to compute them on a computer up to @xmath145 by checking the rank of @xmath80 and @xmath146 for all possible pairs @xmath77 of partitions .",
    "already for @xmath147 the computing times would exceed several days and with @xmath148 at the latest the task nearly becomes an impossibility since the rank of @xmath149 matrices would have to checked for computing the numbers @xmath150 .",
    "so we have to leave it as an interesting open problem to provide more information on the numbers @xmath143 and @xmath144 , see also section [ sec_qn ] .",

    "all the above expressions become equal . as we require the left hand side to be less than @xmath25 , we should choose @xmath157 approximately less than @xmath158 .",

    "if one is interested in choosing the dimension @xmath160 of the problem very large then one may observe that @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( of course , we keep @xmath141 fixed in this limit so that @xmath163 , see ( [ t_model ] ) , has to be adjusted in the process of passing with @xmath15 to infinity . ) this shows that the numbers @xmath164 and @xmath165 play the most important role in the probibility bound ( [ pbound ] ) of theorem [ thm_main ] .",
    "in fact , the tables in the appendix and lemma [ lem_qn0 ] indicate that these numbers are quite small for @xmath166 compared to other values of @xmath81 . * in practice , we usually do not have precisely sparse signals .",

    "this yields @xmath492 requiring that the latter expression is less than @xmath478 is equivalent to @xmath493 as already remarked the choice @xmath494 results in @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "hence , @xmath497 and @xmath498 . since @xmath499 there exists a constant @xmath500 ( whose precise value may be calculated from the numbers above ) such that @xmath501 provided @xmath502 choosing @xmath503 completes the proof of corollary [ cor1 ] .",

    "it seems that @xmath508 is a valid choice .",
    "we conclude this section with some remarks .    * let us give a more detailed reason why we believe that the probilistic model for the `` sparsity set '' @xmath14 is likely to give better probability bounds for exact reconstruction than the deterministic approach holding for all @xmath14 of a given size .",
    "indeed the main difference in the two previous proofs lies in the estimation of @xmath359 and @xmath374 defined in ( [ def_cat ] ) and ( [ def_bat ] ) . if @xmath509 then for deterministic @xmath14 we used the estimation ( [ cat_deterministic ] ) , i.e. , @xmath510 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath14 is an arithmetic progression then @xmath359 may come very close to this upper bound .",
    "however , for generic sets @xmath14 the bound is quite pessimistic .",
    "in fact , in the probabilistic model the expected size of @xmath359 can be bounded by @xmath511 \\,\\leq\\ , \\sum_{s=2}^n ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^s \\sum_{r=0}^{\\min\\{s , t\\}-1 } d^{-r }   \\#\\{{{\\cal{b}}}\\in u(2n , s ) , \\operatorname{rank } m({{\\cal{a}}},{{\\cal{b } } } ) = r\\},\\notag\\ ] ] see lemma [ lem_expcat ] . in particular , if @xmath15 is large ( and @xmath141 not too small ) then the latter estimate should be much better .",
    "let us illustrate this with two examples",
    "let @xmath512 , i.e. , @xmath513 and @xmath514 .",
    "then ( [ cat_deterministic ] ) yields @xmath515 while computing [ exp_cat ] ) explicitly gives @xmath516 \\,=\\ , d^{-1}\\left[({{\\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^2 + 10 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^3 + 20 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^4 + 9 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^5 + ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^6\\right].\\ ] ] clearly , if @xmath15 is sufficiently large then the probabilistic estimate is much better than the deterministic one .",
    "2 .   let @xmath517 , so again @xmath518 and @xmath514 .",
    "then the deterministic estimate gives again @xmath515 while ( [ exp_cat ] ) results in @xmath385 \\,&\\leq\\ , ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^2 + 3 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^3 + ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^4 \\notag\\\\ & + d^{-1}\\left[7 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^3 + 19 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^4 + 9 ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^5 + ( { { \\mathbb{e}}}|t|)^6\\right].\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so here one has to choose both @xmath141 and @xmath519 large to see that potentially the probabilistic estimate is much better . * * discrete fourier transforms : * the whole proofs work without essential change if one replaces our setting by the following one similar to the situation investigated by candes , romberg and tao in @xcite .",
    "consider functions on the cyclic group @xmath520 , @xmath521 , rather than on @xmath2^d$ ] .",
    "the discrete fourier transform is defined by @xmath522 we draw @xmath22 from the uniform distribution on @xmath523 . note that in contrast to sampling from @xmath2^d$ ] it may occur with non - zero probability that some elements of @xmath523 are drawn more than once . but this will not do much harm .",
    "+ let @xmath6 be such that @xmath524 is a sparse vector on @xmath523 .",
    "once again we try to reconstruct @xmath6 from its sample values @xmath525 by minimizing the @xmath0-norm of @xmath524 under the constraint that the observed values @xmath525 are matched .",
    "+ theorems [ thm_main0 ] and [ thm_main ] will also apply to this situation .",
    "indeed , the only thing that differs in the proofs is that we have to calculate modulo @xmath526 in the definition of @xmath359 and @xmath374 , see ( [ def_cat ] ) and ( [ def_bat ] ) .",
    "this is apparent from ( [ expect_trig ] ) where the integral is replaced by a sum of exponentials . nevertheless , the deterministic and probabilistic estimates for the quantities @xmath359 and @xmath374 still hold and so everything goes through in completely the same manner .",
    "+ of course , one can also exchange the role of @xmath6 and @xmath524 , aiming at reconstructing a sparse signal on @xmath523 from random samples of its fourier transform . indeed",
    ", this situation is investigated in @xcite with a different probability model for the sampling points .",
    "in other words , we presented a slightly different approach for the main result in @xcite .",
    "from theorem [ thm_main ] we realize that we have to investigate the functions @xmath527 connected to set partitions in @xmath67 and also the numbers @xmath76 and @xmath528 , respectively .",
    "we already gave some information on the number @xmath529 of partitions in @xmath67 earlier .",
    "let us be a bit more detailed here .",
    "clearly , by definition ( [ def_fn ] ) of @xmath100 and the generating function ( [ expgen_func ] ) we see that @xmath530 ( this follows also directly from the proof of theorem [ thm_main0 ] . ) in particular , @xmath101 is a polynomial of degree @xmath49 .",
    "there are different ways of computing @xmath531 explicitly .",
    "one possibility is to use the generating function ( [ expgen_func ] ) leading to @xmath532 one may also compute the numbers @xmath47 explicitly . indeed , differentiating ( [ expgen_func ] ) @xmath40 times with respect to @xmath533 and setting @xmath534 yields @xmath535 expanding the right hand side into a power series and comparing coefficients yields ( after some computations ) @xmath536 valid for @xmath537 ( otherwise @xmath538 ) . in the special case @xmath539",
    "we obtain @xmath540 .",
    "further , a combinatorial argument shows that @xmath541 .",
    "( one uses that @xmath542 consists only of partitions where each block has precisely @xmath41 elements . )        unfortunately , much less is known about the number of partitions in @xmath547 . as already mentioned , it was only very recently that d. knuth @xcite posed the problem of determining @xmath548 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath549 the number of all partitions of @xmath550 having no adjacencies ( recall that @xmath551 ) .",
    "recently , it was proved in @xcite that @xmath552 .",
    "so ( [ gen_func_pn ] ) is also the exponential generating function of the numbers @xmath553 . concerning the size of @xmath56 , up to now",
    ", we can not say more than that it is bounded by the number of all partitions into @xmath433 blocks of a set with @xmath554 elements , i.e. , by the ( ordinary ) stirling number of the second kind @xmath555 . if @xmath556 then @xmath557 as already remarked .",
    "the stirling numbers @xmath558 have the generating function @xcite @xmath559 let us denote @xmath560 .",
    "then clearly @xmath561 with equality if @xmath556 . a lower bound for @xmath562 is given by the numbers @xmath563 .",
    "now some elementary observations concerning the numbers @xmath76 and @xmath564 can be made .",
    "disregarding the rank of @xmath80 , the number of all pairs @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 is @xmath565 , hence , @xmath566 and similarly for @xmath528 .",
    "summing also over @xmath378 and @xmath433 gives @xmath567 and @xmath568 . in the following table",
