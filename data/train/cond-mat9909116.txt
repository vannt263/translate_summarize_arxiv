    "liquid metals are complex binary fluids consisting of ions in a sea of conduction electrons .",
    "while the ions can usually be treated classically , the electrons are typically degenerate and must be treated quantum - mechanically .",
    "liquids are differentiated from gases by non - trivial structure at the level of two - body correlation functions ; they are generally close in density to solid phases . for two - component systems",
    "these correlation functions are defined in @xmath0-space as : @xmath1 the @xmath2 are referred to as static structure factors and the operator @xmath3 is the fourier transform of the one - particle density operator of component @xmath4 . the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to ions , ( @xmath6 ) , or valence electrons , ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the structure factors @xmath2 can be related to the so - called radial distribution functions @xmath8 by : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where the @xmath10 are the homogeneous average densities .",
    "the determination of the ion - ion structure factor @xmath11 and the electron - electron structure factor @xmath12 are interesting problems in their own right ( one largely quantum mechanical , the other largely classical ) , and have been the focus of much research : the @xmath11 because of their experimental accessibility ; the @xmath12 ( with the ions usually smeared into a rigid neutralising background ) because of the importance of the electron fluid@xcite . in contrast , the electron - ion structure factor @xmath13 has received considerably less attention , partially because it is hard to measure , partially because its exact physical relevance remains largely unexplored and unknown , and partially because it includes both the physics of the ions _ and _ the physics of the electrons , each of which is traditionally treated with its own set of theoretical techniques .",
    "one of the simplest ways to treat the valence electrons in a liquid metal is in a linear response formalism using a local pseudo - potential@xcite .",
    "in fact , linear response has been shown to be much more accurate than one would navely expect , a result which stems in part from a recently discovered interference effect between an atomic lengthscale , the inverse ionic length , and an electronic lengthscale , twice the fermi wave vector @xmath14@xcite .",
    "this interference effect significantly reduces the magnitude of the non - linear response terms at the normal densities of most liquid metals .",
    "the electron - ion correlations emerge when the induced linear response electron density is combined with standard liquid state techniques to treat the ions@xcite .",
    "this approach is easy to implement , can in some cases be remarkably accurate , and can explain the qualitative trends in the shape of the electron - ion structure factor @xmath13 for metallic liquids across the periodic table@xcite .",
    "the main obstacles to higher accuracy lie in the uncertainty over the exact ( local ) pseudo - potential , especially when non - local effects are important@xcite , and also in the neglect of non - linear electron response and of ion - ion correlation effects on the induced electron densities@xcite .",
    "the development of _ ab initio _",
    "simulation techniques based on density functional theory ( dft ) for the electrons@xcite , and molecular - dynamics on the adiabatic electronic potential energy surface for the ions@xcite , provide probably the most accurate and well - tested approach to electron - ion structure .",
    "however , the drawback of these methods is their computational cost ; in practice only relatively small system sizes can be investigated and so far only results for mg and bi electron - ion correlations have been published@xcite .",
    "the related orbital - free _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics method ( of - aimd)@xcite allows larger system sizes and significantly longer simulation times , and has been successfully applied to the electron - ion correlations of li , na , mg , and al@xcite , but the computational cost is still rather large .",
    "an alternative approach is the quantum hypernetted chain ( qhnc ) method of chihara@xcite , which self - consistently combines integral equation techniques from the theory of simple liquids with a kohn - sham type treatment for the electrons .",
    "the qhnc treats the electrons and ions on essentially equal footing , does not require a pseudo - potential approximation , and is computationally relatively cheap .",
    "ion - ion and electron - ion correlations emerge in the thermodynamic limit  there are no finite size effects .    in section",
    "ii , we derive the basic form of the qhnc approximation by focusing first on the exact quantum ornstein zernike ( qoz ) equations in section ii.a , and then outlining the approximations needed to derive the qhnc approximation in section ii.b .",
    "the numerical implementation of the qhnc is detailed in the appendix .    in section iii",
    ", we describe the ion - ion and electron - ion correlations that emerge from the qhnc for our set of metals : li , be , na , mg , al , k , ca , and ga .    even though the valence electron distributions are changed in a bonded environment , x - ray scattering off liquid metals has traditionally been interpreted with a free - atom form factor . in section iv , we describe the difference between extracting ion - ion structure in x - ray scattering with a free - atom form factor and extracting ion - ion structure with a metallic - atom form factor .",
    "the effects of bonding on the coherent x - ray scattering intensity may be measured by comparing x - ray and neutron scattering determinations of the ion - ion structure factor @xmath11 .",
    "however , experiments and theory have yet to converge on this issue .    finally , we present some concluding remarks in section v , and describe some details related to the numerical implementation of the qhnc in the appendix .",
    "the quantum ornstein zernike relations ( qoz ) for a two - component system are most naturally derived in the context of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "first we define the helmholtz free - energy for a two - component system , which is a unique functional of the two one - body density profiles@xcite : @xmath15 = f_1^{id}[\\rho_1 ] + f_2^{id}[\\rho_2 ] +   f^{ex}[\\rho_1,\\rho_2].\\ ] ] the functional is split in the usual way between ideal ( non - interacting ) and excess ( interacting ) parts .",

    "the direct correlation functions @xmath27 of an arbitrary two - component mixture are defined in the usual way as functional derivatives of the excess free energy@xcite : @xmath28 if we then define @xmath29 as the inverse susceptibility matrix of the ideal system , we arrive , by combining equations ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , ( [ eq2.5b ] ) and ( [ eq2.6 ] ) , at the following relationship between two 2-by-2 matrices : @xmath30 the * quantum ornstein zernike relations ( qoz)*. they follow from simple properties of the two free - energy functionals and in this form they are valid for _ any _ two - component inhomogeneous quantum system ( the generalisation to more than two components is straightforward ) . in the homogeneous limit the direct correlation functions of eq .",

    "the first step is to use the percus trick@xcite to relate the _ homogeneous _ two - body pair - correlation functions to the one - body _ inhomogeneous _ density around one particle fixed at the origin . for the electron - ion pair - correlation function",
    "we fix an ion at the origin to find : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ( interacting ) valence electron density induced by one ion at the origin .",
    "a similar relationship holds for the ion - ion pair - correlation function , but for the electron - electron pair correlation function the percus trick can not be used in this form ; one can not `` fix '' an electron at the origin .",
    "the second step follows the basic ideas of the kohn - sham scheme@xcite , namely that there exists a local single - particle external potential @xmath41 which will induce in a _ non - interacting _ system the same one - particle density @xmath42 as is found in the full _ interacting _ system .",
    "this idea holds both for quantum as well as for classical systems .",
    "the external effective potential felt by species @xmath4 when species @xmath5 is fixed at the origin follows directly from the euler equations : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the direct interaction between species and @xmath45 is the excess chemical potential .",

    "the remaining third and higher order functional derivative terms are lumped into the so - called _ bridge functions _",
    "we note that these equations do not hold for the effective electron - electron potential @xmath58 .    up to this point ,",
    "our formulation is in principle exact .",
    "however , since the exact free - energy functionals and the related effective external potentials are unknown , some approximations must be made . in the language of the theory of classical liquids@xcite",

    "this is the essence of the qhnc approach : the original many - center problem has been reduced to an effective one - center problem by replacing the many - body ion - ion correlations with an effective external potential that depends self - consistently on the ion - ion correlations .",
    "the main advantages are that ( a ) no pseudo - potential is needed , i.e.  it is an all - electron calculation and ( b ) ion - ion and electron - ion correlations emerge naturally and on the same footing .",
    "details of the ( rather complex ) numerical implementation of the qhnc are described in the appendix .",

    ".    the case of ga , however , calls for closer examination . while the exact form of @xmath67 is sensitive to details of the liquid state theory aspects of the closure , i.e.  the form of the bridge function , we tried various forms of the closure without much improvement . on the other hand ,",
    "when we used the ortiz - ballone@xcite local field factor instead of the ichimaru - utsumi form@xcite , a considerable improvement was obtained , in agreement with earlier studies based on effective ion - ion potentials@xcite .",
    "this sensitivity of the qhnc approach to details of the local field factor @xmath68 suggests that approximation ( 5 ) of the previous section begins to break down .",
    "in addition , the d - electrons were very close to being unbound , which made the qhnc algorithm difficult to converge .",
    "this instability may be attributed to the implicit separation of the exchange - correlation potential into bound and valence contributions in approximation ( 4 ) , i.e.  the neglect of non - linear  core - corrections .",
    "the fact that the ortiz - ballone @xmath68 seems to work better for ga is most likely due to an accidental cancellation of errors .",
    "it performs considerably worse than the lda or ichimaru - utsumi @xmath68@xcite for the other metals in our set .",

    "as is the case for the ion - ion radial distribution functions , the qhnc approximation gives similar results to other methods for all the elements except ga , where once again an improved agreement is obtained when the ortiz - ballone @xmath68 is used .",
    "it is instructive to compare the pseudo - atom density , included in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as @xmath75 , with the electron - ion radial distribution function @xmath74 .",
    "the pseudo - atom density goes to zero for larger @xmath72 , as it is essentially localised around a given ion , while @xmath74 goes to 1 for large @xmath72 , reflecting the fact that outside the range of the ion s _ own _ pseudo - atom , @xmath74 simply probes the average density of the pseudo - atoms around the _ other _ ions so that the probability of finding a valence electron a distance @xmath72 away is simply related to the probability of finding an ion there . @xmath74 and @xmath75 are essentially identical for small @xmath72 , as one might expect , while at larger @xmath72 the effect of the ion - ion weighted superposition of the surrounding pseudo - atoms on @xmath74 is evident .    because @xmath74 implicitly includes a spherical average ,",
    "all angular bonding effects are effectively washed out , although an indication of the effect of bonding can still be found by comparing @xmath74 and a superposition of the free - atom electron densities@xcite .    the relationships between the pseudo - atom , the ionic correlations , and the electron - ion correlations become clearer in @xmath0-space where the electron - ion structure factor is simply the product of the pseudo - atom density and the ion - ion structure factor , as shown in eq.([eq3.5 ] ) .",
    "the ion - ion structure factor is sharply peaked at its first maximum @xmath76 while the pseudo - atom density goes through zero at @xmath77 .",
    "if @xmath78 , the product form implies that the first peak of @xmath13 is negative , and the electron - ion structure is in the so - called _ low valence class _ , while if @xmath79 , then the first peak of @xmath13 is positive , and the electron - ion structure is in the so - called _ high valence class_@xcite . in fig",

    "neutron scattering probes the fluctuations of the nuclei , while x - ray scattering probes the fluctuations of all the electrons . in 1974 , egelstaff _ et .",
    "@xcite first suggested exploiting this difference to extract electron - ion correlations for liquid metals . in 1987 , chihara@xcite re - examined the x - ray scattering problem , demonstrating that a careful analysis of elastic and inelastic contributions leads to the following coherent scattering intensity@xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the nucleus - nucleus structure factor which emerges , for example , from neutron scattering , @xmath82 is the ionic form factor , i.e.  the ionic electron density , and @xmath70 is the pseudo - atom density .",
    "we shall call the object @xmath83 the _ metallic - atom form factor_. traditionally the structure factor from x - ray scattering @xmath84 has been extracted from scattering intensity as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the _ free - atom form factor _ , or the free - atom electron - density .",
    "the difference between the two structure - factors , @xmath81 and @xmath84 , stems from the difference between the two form factors , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and provides a measure of the change in electron density upon bonding . in fig .",

    "also included are the pseudo - atom densities ( chain lines ) .",
    "the ionic form factor is essentially the same in the metallic and the free - atom environments , so the difference between the metallic and free - atom form factors stems from the difference between the pseudo - atom density and the valence - electron density of the free atom .",
    "because x - rays scatter off all the electrons , not just the valence electrons , the effects of bonding are most pronounced when the ratio of the number of valence electrons @xmath88 to the total number of electrons @xmath89 is high .",

    "similarly , in liquids the scattering is strongest at the first peak of the structure factor ( at wave - number @xmath76 ) , so to observe a difference between @xmath84 and @xmath81 it is important that the free - atom and the metallic - atom form factors differ near @xmath76 .",

    "[ fig7 ] the difference , @xmath99 , is shown for our whole set of metals .",
    "generally the peak - height for @xmath84 is slightly lower than the peak - height for @xmath81 and the two structure factors are virtually identical away from @xmath76 . as was anticipated in ref .",
    ", the largest difference is for be , where @xmath100 is about @xmath101 lower than @xmath102 .",
    "however , be is extremely toxic , and for that reason its static structure has not yet been measured .",
    "perhaps the best chance of observing a difference between @xmath84 and @xmath81 is for li , mg , or al , where the difference at @xmath76 is about @xmath103 .",
    "another possibility includes liquid metallic si , where the ratio is ( 1:3.5 ) , and @xmath77 is expected to be greater than @xmath76 ( i.e. si s electron - ion structure is expected to be in the high valence class ) , so that @xmath100 is expected to be _ larger _ than @xmath102 and the structure factor may peak in a region where the two form factors differ by a larger amount than is the case for the low - valence class metals .",
    "measuring these differences will be extremely challenging , since they require two completely different scattering techniques , which implies subtracting two different sets of systematic corrections .",
    "in particular , the removal of incoherent scattering effects from the total scattering remains under discussion@xcite .",
    "we note that a series of experiments measuring the differences between x - ray and neutron - scattering determinations of @xmath11 have been reported for li@xcite , na , mg , al , zn , ga , sn , te , tl , pb , and bi@xcite .",
    "these measurements typically show differences that are at best 5 to 10 times larger than expected from theoretical treatments of the bonding effects , such as those shown for the qhnc in fig .",
    "[ fig7]@xcite .",
    "in fact for some of the heavier elements , where the @xmath104 is expected to be very small due to the large number of core electrons , the differences are several orders of magnitude larger . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we include explicitly the combined x - ray and neutron data of olbrich _",
    "et.al._@xcite for li . even though their differences are smaller than any of the differences measured in the other references cited in [ ] ( in fact they are the only measurements which fit within the scale of our graphs@xcite ) , olbrich _ et.al . _ claim that experimental errors are too large to see bonding effects in @xmath11 .",
    "for these reasons , the _ interpretation _ of these measurements has been called into question by a number of authors@xcite .",
    "the theoretical results are very robust , with simple linear response theories in some cases agreeing quantitatively with the much more sophisticated _ ab - initio _ kohn - sham calculations@xcite . in a crystalline environment ,",
    "the kohn - sham approach has been shown to agree quantitatively to several significant figures with highly accurate experimental measurements of the bonding densities@xcite , suggesting that the electron densities calculated within the kohn - sham approach for the liquid state analogon of these solid state measurements should be highly accurate as well .",
    "in fact , for the kohn - sham type simulations , finite size and statistical finite simulation time effects on the ion - ion structure probably cause larger errors than errors arising from the determination of the electron densities . however , these simulation errors are well understood , and will at most contribute a few _ relative _ @xmath105 to the difference @xmath99 .",
    "the considerations above , coupled with the difficulties in dealing with the subtraction of two very different sets of systematic corrections to the data@xcite , lead us to conclude that the experiments cited have not yet attained an accuracy sufficient to measure the effects of bonding in liquid metals .",
    "however , the advent of new high - accuracy x - ray and neutron beam sources coming on line , together with the improvement of other techniques such as anomalous x - ray scattering@xcite , may bring the measurement of these differences within experimental reach , at least for a few of the metals in our set .",
    "it seems increasingly unlikely that this could be measured for many other elements where the ratio @xmath106 is smaller and the core - electrons wash out any bonding effects .",
    "we have carried out qhnc calculations for li , be , na , mg , al , k , ca , and ga . the qhnc formalism , first introduced and mainly developed by j. chihara@xcite is a closure to the qoz relations .",
    "ion - ion and electron - ion correlations naturally emerge in a unified fashion , and the interpretation of liquid metals in terms of a `` pseudo - atom '' helps clarify the meaning of the electron - ion radial distribution functions and structure factors .    the most serious approximation in the qhnc is probably approximation ( 5 ) from section ii.b , where the electron - electron direct - correlation function @xmath62 is approximated by the form for jellium , making it independent of the ion - ion and electron - ion correlations .",
