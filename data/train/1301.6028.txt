    "trapping and manipulating ultracold neutral atoms in an array of optical potentials opened a vast new research area in the field of quantum fluids and solid state modeling @xcite . demonstrating the superfluid to mott insulator quantum phase transition of interacting bosons in an optical lattice laid the foundation to study and simulate strongly correlated quantum many - body systems with a big impact on condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are now one of the most flourishing directions of experimental and theoretical quantum physics @xcite . besides fundamental physics issues on entanglement , measurement and decoherence @xcite , more and more applications appear for the quantum simulations for a wide range of puzzling effects in solid state physics .",
    "a bec of a dilute bosons , in which a very large number of atoms occupy the same quantum state of motion , was experimentally realized by several groups @xcite .",
    "optical control of the quantum state of such bec opened the door to a new generation of experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular the loading of the bec into a standing wave formed by pairs of counter propagating far detuned laser beams creates a synthetic controllable periodic lattice @xcite .",
    "trapped atoms still can tunnel from site to site , while interacting and repelling each other when occupying the same site .",
    "the stronger the laser field , the deeper the lattice and the slower the hopping rate of the atoms , while at the same time the on - site interaction between the atoms becomes stronger .",
    "thus the laser light allows to switch between a weakly interacting gas , where atoms form a superfluid , to a strongly correlated regime , where atoms avoid each other and localize into individual sites forming a perfectly regular array called mott insulator phase .",
    "as this crossover happens at @xmath0 as a function of an external parameter , it is called a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is theoretically well described by a bose - hubbard model @xcite and soon was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "an increasing degree of control of experimental parameters in optical lattices has been demonstrated up to the level of addressing and controlling single atoms at a specific lattice site @xcite .    in a parallel development",
    "the dynamics of the electromagnetic field modes in a high - q optical cavity resonantly coupled to quantized excitations of atoms has been extensively studied .",
    "many phenomena discussed as gedanken - experiments to exhibit the quantum physics of coupled systems and measurements were actually performed experimentally and lead to the recent 2012 physics nobel prize @xcite . the first experimental realizations of cavity qed used single rydberg atoms in superconducting microwave resonators . later ground state",
    "alkali atoms in high - q optical resonators allowed to reach the strong coupling limit as well , where light matter coupling dominates decoherence @xcite .",
    "other implementations using solid state technology followed more recently @xcite .",
    "it is of course a natural development to combine these two threads and investigate ultracold atomic lattices within optical resonators @xcite . as a major experimental step in this direction ,",
    "several groups @xcite achieved operations of a bec of trapped ultracold atoms within an optical high - q cavity deeply in the strong resonant coupling regime .",
    "it seems thus that no major technical obstacles prevent the implementation of an optical lattice within an optical cavity .",
    "an alternative route for realizing an optical lattice within a cavity is based on a co - planar waveguide microwave resonator resonantly coupled to the collective hyperfine state of a bec of ultracold atoms in a wire surface trap fabricated on a superconducting atom chip @xcite . this system is predicted to allow the experimental study of magnetic dipole interactions in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "placing ultracold atoms within optical cavities leads to a wealth of interesting dynamical phenomena already in the dispersive regime , where the light frequency is far detuned from the atomic resonance .",
    "this involves a dynamic interplay of light forces , non - local couplings and field dynamics @xcite . in this review",
    "instead we concentrate on resonant interaction of quantized light modes and trapped atoms in the mott phase , which we treat as a new type of matter closely related to an atomic crystal with widely controllable lattice geometry @xcite . while in some general cases we consider coupling of the light to motional degrees of freedom as well , our main emphasis is on collective internal excitations dynamics .",
    "this reduced description already allows to study many solid state effects in a very generic form .",
    "the wide and precise controllability of different lattices and coupling parameters allows to change the number of atoms per site , the geometry , and the symmetry of the system .",
    "these facts give the present system a decisive advantage over conventional solid state crystals where parameters are hardly tunable and particular effects can not be easily singled out .",
    "such toy implementations provide to us a more detailed and deeper understanding of solid state effects .",
    "mathematically one extends the common bose - hubbard atom model to include atoms in excited states formally described as a second kind of bosons within the optical lattice . the system is then represented by a two - component bose - hubbard model exhibiting a much richer phase diagram @xcite .",
    "optical lattices allow us to go beyond the weakly interacting regime of bose gas into strongly correlated systems of solid state physics @xcite . including the internal atomic level structure bears a strong analogy to the excitonic dynamics of molecular crystals , described by `` frenkel excitons '' @xcite .",
    "the electronic excitations delocalize in the lattice due to electrostatic interactions , e.g. resonant dipole - dipole interactions . by exploiting the lattice symmetry one is lead to introduce wave - like collective electronic excitations",
    "called `` excitons '' as fundamental system excitations @xcite . for this expansion to make sense",
    ", the transfer time has to be faster than the exciton lifetime , so that collective states of electronic excitations dominate the electrical and optical system properties .",
    "excitons thus provide an ideal basis to describe resonant effects in optical lattices .",
    "in fact the atomic recoil heating due to emission and absorption of a photon is significantly suppressed as the momentum is shared among all atoms in the lattice and strongly suppress diffusion and heating in the mott insulator .",
    "we present studies of the properties and dynamics of excitons for several generic lattice types of different geometries and dimensionality , starting from finite chains , infinite chains to stacks of two dimensional planar lattices @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions of finite systems give rise to standing wave excitons , while extended systems produce propagating wave solutions . as a special case a mott insulator with two atoms per site can also possess dark on - site localized excitons decoupled from the remaining lattice sites @xcite .",
    "the energy delocalization of excitons among many particles amounts to the occurrence of intrinsic entanglement . to generate and preserve significant entanglement",
    "requires sufficient isolation from the environment in order to bring decoherence and dissipation to a minimum , which is a big challenge for optically excited systems",
    ". here spontaneous emission due to the coupling to free space radiation is a major source of dissipation and decoherence @xcite .",
    "excitons in multi - atom systems exhibit significantly modified spontaneous emission compared to a single atom @xcite , which we have extensively studied for different geometries and dimensions @xcite . while often excitons exhibit enhanced coupling to excitation lasers and vacuum modes and fast or superradiant decay , in many cases one can get long lived or even dark and metastable excitations , which can only decay optically into a narrow set of wave - vectors analogous to bragg angles . if the lattice spacing is smaller than the transition wavelength , the exciton wave vector can be larger than the free space photon wave - vector , so that no optical decay is possible .",
    "nevertheless one can still engineer coherent transfer of such excitons among different lattice regions or different optical lattice planes @xcite .",
    "this effect should have important applications in optical information storage and transfer based on large ensembles .",
    "interestingly , while the individual dipole - dipole energy transfer has an inverse cubic dependence on the distance , collective states within one lattice plane only couple with an exponentially decreasing strength to neighboring planes , which generally allows simplification to a nearest neighbor coupling model .    tailored light - matter interaction is of great importance to fundamental physics tests as well as high end technical applications @xcite and in particular for the development of quantum information technologies @xcite .",
    "new frontiers of cavity qed involving ultracold atoms trapped in intra - cavity optical lattices form a natural , but only very recently opened , research direction @xcite .",
    "as above , we concentrate here on atoms with an internal electronic transition close to resonance with a cavity mode , while the optical lattice is generated by external classical fields which are off - resonance to any of the internal atomic transitions forming the dynamical part of the system .",
    "the case of cavity generated optical potentials also exhibits a wealth of interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the two - component bose - hubbard model to include cavity photons and their coupling to electronic excitations of the cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram including superfluid and mott regions is affected by the coupling to cavity photons which mediate long range interactions and enhance tunneling via field fluctuations .",
    "even though using a rather simple model we see that the quantum phase transition to a perfectly ordered mott state occurs at much deeper optical lattices than in free space .    in cavities , excitons and photons",
    "are coherently coupled to form new quasi - particles called polaritons @xcite .",
    "as the cavity mirrors exhibit a finite transition probability , the detection of the emitted light provides us with detailed information about the system properties @xcite .",
    "the corresponding optical spectra give a largely nondestructive observation tool for different quantum phases with minimal back - action @xcite .",
    "as an additional example the formation of molecules in the optical lattice introduces optical anisotropy in our artificial crystal .",
    "this manifests itself in the spectra through the cavity photon polarization mixing @xcite .",
    "again our studies range from finite lattices inside optical cavities of spherical mirrors up to two dimensional lattices between planar cavity mirrors . as an interesting property for the search of lower temperatures , the elastic scattering of excitons and polaritons by the defects or vacancies in the mott insulator phase",
    "can be observed via cavity transmission spectra without destroying the lattice state as it occurs in high aperture microscope detection via fluorescence @xcite .",
    "similarly atoms excited to higher bloch bands change the dynamics of excitons and polaritons @xcite .",
    "optical properties of a gas of ultracold atoms with coherently dressed two - level and three - level systems in a mott insulator phase of an optical lattice have been studied by @xcite .",
    "cooperative effects of ultracold molecules in optical lattices are also treated @xcite .",
    "recently rydberg atoms become of large interest for optical lattices .",
    "rydberg excitations in bose - einstein condensates of rubidium atoms loaded into quasi - one - dimensional traps and in optical lattices experimentally have been realized @xcite .",
    "moreover , the formation of excitons in a regular and flexible chain of rydberg atoms as introduced through the interplay between excitonic and atomic motion was proposed theoretically by @xcite .",
    "free space optical lattices have been formed in many geometries from one dimensional to three dimensional . in a parallel development",
    "also evanescent fields have been used to trap atoms and create new lattice geometries . in a particularly interesting and potentially important example , tapered optical fibers were used to trap neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "these are coupled to the propagating fiber modes via evanescent fields surrounding the fiber @xcite .",
    "such a hybrid combination of atoms and a solid state devices allows trapping and , simultaneously , optically interfacing @xcite .",
    "fibers with diameters smaller than the wavelength exhibit strong transverse confinement and a pronounced evanescent field , which by using two colors can be designed to create an array of deep optical micro - traps .",
    "it was recently realized with cesium atoms , where it was shown that the atoms can be efficiently trapped and interrogated with a resonant light field sent through the nanofiber @xcite .",
    "this setup provides an ideal test system to study one dimensional excitons , for which we developed a microscopic theory .",
    "the strong collective coupling between atoms and field modes naturally leads to the formations polaritons in this setup @xcite .",
    "as one of the most interesting consequences we could show that one can create polaritons with a strong fiber mode contributions but with virtually no coupling to the free space radiation modes .",
    "this should constitute an ideal photon - atom ensemble interface for coherent quantum information storage and processing .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we extend the bose - hubbard model to exploit electronically excited atoms . in section 3",
    "we introduce excitons into a system of ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "we discuss their formation , dispersion and life times for different geometries and dimensionality .",
    "section 4 is opened by discussing the quantum phase transition within a cavity followed by introducing cavity polaritons in the strong coupling regime , where various possible physical realizations are studied .",
    "defects of atoms excited into higher bloch bands or vacancies in the mott insulator phase are treated in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are contained in section 6 .",
    "optical lattices created by off resonance laser fields constitute a regular array of micro - traps into which a dilute gas of ultracold atoms can be loaded @xcite .",
    "the atoms experience an optical lattice potential with lattice constant of half the wave length of the lattice laser with different depth for each internal atomic state . at ultra low temperatures , @xmath1",
    ", atoms are localized at the lowest bloch band of the lattice . in such structures",
    ", atoms can hop among different sites through quantum tunneling and interact locally via scattering .",
    "the tunneling process is mainly among nearest neighbor sites with the hopping parameter @xmath2 , and the atom - atom interactions are efficient only for atoms at the same lattice site with an effective strength @xmath3 , which is taken to be a repulsive determined by the @xmath4-wave scattering length .",
    "this system is well described by a bose - hubbard model @xcite represented by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators of an atom at site @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the atom on - site energy , which includes the external trap potential , @xmath10 is the chemical potential accounting for a possible exchange of atoms with an external atomic reservoir .",
    "the @xmath8 summation is over the lattice sites , and the bracket indicates a possible hopping only between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the bose - hubbard model predicts a quantum phase transition between the superfluid and the mott insulator phase by changing the external laser field intensity , that is changing the kinetic versus the repulsion energy of the quantum gas . in the limit of @xmath11",
    "the atom hopping among the lattice sites dominates the dynamics and the atomic states are spread out over the whole lattice and one gets a superfluid . in the opposite limit @xmath12 , the on - site atom - atom interaction dominates and the atoms localize deterministically at individual sites , so that we have a mott insulator .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram can be calculated in the mean - field approach @xcite . in fig .  [ 1 ] the phase diagram is plotted in the plane @xmath13 which is scaled by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of nearest neighbors .",
    "the superfluid ( sf ) phase appears outside the shaded three mott insulator ( mi ) phase regions , which are for one , two , and three atoms per site , that is @xmath16 , where we assumed @xmath17 . in the mean field approximation",
    "the systems dimensionality enters only through @xmath15 , where in a hyper - cubic lattice for the one dimension @xmath18 we have @xmath19 , for @xmath20 we have @xmath21 , and for @xmath22 we have @xmath23 .",
    "vs. @xmath24 .",
    "the superfluid sf and the three mott insulator mi regions , for @xmath16 , are shown .",
    "figure reprinted with permission from  @xcite copyright 2009 by american physical society.,width=321 ]      in the present review we study collective electronic excitations of an atomic mott insulator .",
    "hence we have to introduce an excited atom state , which modifies the above phase diagram as we now have two - level atoms treated here as two kinds of atoms , namely ground state atoms and atoms excited to a fixed internal state .",
    "when loaded on an optical lattice due to different polarizability and stark shift of the ground and excited states each group of atoms experiences a different optical lattice potential , but with ground and excited potentials showing extrema at the same positions , as schematized in fig .",
    "[ 2 ] . for certain , magic , laser wave lengths ,",
    "light shift yield nevertheless identical potentials .",
    "this is important e.g. to create an optical lattice clock @xcite .",
    "close to @xmath0 the ground and the excited atoms will again occupy only their lowest bloch band .",
    "we consider the two groups of atoms with different internal states , hyperfine or electronic , as two kinds of bosons .",
    "therefore , we generalize the single - component bose - hubbard model into two - component bose hubbard model @xcite , with the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators of a ground state atom at site @xmath8 , respectively , with the on - site energy @xmath26 , and chemical potential @xmath27 ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the creation and annihilation operators of an excited state atom at site @xmath8 , respectively , with on - site energy @xmath30 , and chemical potential @xmath31 ; where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the effective atomic transition frequency , which can include ac stark - shifts relative to the free atomic transition frequency . here",

    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the on - site ground and excited state atom - atom interactions , respectively , and @xmath38 is the on - site ground - excited atom interaction related to scattering between ground and excited state atoms .",
    "this extended model leads to a much richer phase diagram .",
    "now we present one typical example of the phase diagram , which is calculated in using the mean - field approach . in figures [ 3 ] we plot the phase diagram for the plane @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 , and @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 , which are scaled by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we used for the energies @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and for the scaled atom - atom coupling the number @xmath47 . here the excited and ground phase transition lines split , the transition line ( le ) is for excited state atoms , and ( lg ) for ground state atoms . beside the superfluid phase ,",
    "we get three other regions .",
    "the mott insulator region with one ground state and one excited state atom per site , that is @xmath48 .",
    "the sm region , where the excited state atoms are in the mott insulator phase with one atom per site , and the ground state atoms are in the superfluid phase .",
    "the ms region , where the ground state atoms are in the mott insulator phase with one atom per site , and the excited state atoms are in the superfluid phase .",
    "we like to mention here that more complex quantum phases are suppressed under the present mean field theory , e.g. , that of the anti - ferromagnetic type in which the mott insular includes an excited atom at one site and a ground one in the nearest neighbor sites @xcite .     vs. @xmath40 , and @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 .",

    "as shown above even for two state atoms one can prepare a perfectly filled mott phase for the atoms , which we will use as the basis of our further considerations involving resonant excitations .",
    "we focus on a single atom per site , but eventually allow for two atoms per site as in subsection 3.5 .",
    "the mott insulator constitutes an artificial crystal with a lattice constant much larger than the average dimension of the atom .",
    "therefore , each atom retains its identity except from the internal shifts and there are no overlaps among electronic wave functions of atoms setting at different sites as in conventional solids .",
    "we conclude that our artificial lattice is similar to molecular or noble atom crystals but allow for the wide controlablity of the system parameters , as the artificial lattice is formed by variable external laser field .",
    "solid molecular crystals , however , are fixed by the chemical bonds , e.g. van der waals forces , and can be only slightly controlled in applying external fields .",
    "frenkel excitons play a central role in optical and electrical properties of molecular crystals @xcite . here",
    "we ask the question related to the possibility of the formation of frenkel like - excitons for optical lattices .",
    "first we discuss the possibility of energy transfer among atoms at different sites induced by electrostatic interactions or resonant dipole - dipole interactions , which is the main mechanism behind the formation of excitons .",

    "here we consider only energy transfer without charge transfer ?",
    "this process is possible through the resonance dipole - dipole interaction @xcite with the energy transfer parameter @xmath51\\left(1 - 3\\cos^2\\theta\\right)\\right .",

    "we present an alternative mechanism for the excitation and de - excitation of atoms between different bloch bands through the coupling of the internal electronic excitation to the external atomic motion via electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "we consider here the mott insulator with one atom per site where the atoms are treated as two - level systems . in general ground and excited atoms in optical lattices experience different optical lattice potentials , and can have minima at different positions , the fact that induces the coupling of electronic excitations to the vibrational modes .",

    "we concentrate on the case of a low defect number , where the exciton and cavity polariton picture still holds and these quasi - particles are only scattered by single defects .",
    "namely , the distance between each two defects is large enough for the formation of coherent excitons and cavity polaritons , which propagate as free quasi - particles between each two scattering processes . in principle",
    "the defects can move by hopping among the lattice sites , but the corresponding time scale is so long that they can be considered frozen . here",

    "a single atom missing at the origin ( @xmath514 ) then creates an impurity in the artificial lattice of ultracold atoms , which for sufficient lattice depth stays localized and will not hop among the lattice sites as shown in fig .",
    "we study the scattering of excitons off such a missing atom .",

    "the polariton dispersion can considered approximately parabolic with a polariton effective mass of @xmath536 .",
    "this is of the order of the cavity photon effective mass @xmath537 .",
    "hence , the lower polariton branch dispersion is taken to be @xmath538 , and we have in general @xmath539 .",
    "the scattered states will also have small wavevectors due to the energy conservation . as the upper branch has higher energies",
    "its contributions are negligibly small .",
    "in addition the upper branch for larger wavevectors is mainly photonic with small excitonic part , and thus it contributes only weakly to the impurity scattering .",
    "we consider the case around zero detuning between the excitons and photons .",
    "therefore the excitonic weight @xmath540 will change from half around zero wave vector up to one for large wave vectors , where the lower branch became excitonic .",
    "because we neglect the contribution of the upper polariton branch , we drop the branch index , and all the parameters will be only for the lower branch . for simplicity",
    ", we use a model for the lower branch dispersion in place of the real one .",
    "the lower branch is divided into two parts : the first part between @xmath541 is taken to be of a parabolic dispersion with a polariton effective mass , where @xmath542 ; and the second part between @xmath543 , where @xmath163 is the brillouin boundary , is taken to be dispersionless with energy equal to the exciton energy at zero wave vector , with @xmath544 .",
