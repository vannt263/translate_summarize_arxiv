    "several versions of the reconstruction program have been tested and a reconstruction efficiency of about 95 - 97% per charged track has been achieved with a momentum uncertainty of 4@xmath19 for 250 mev / c charged particles . the energy resolution of 8@xmath19 for photons in the csi calorimeter has been obtained .",

    "but the reconstruction efficiency in the jet type dc cells drops down for tracks with a vertex radius greater than approximately 5 cm leaving only 0.64% of all detected events with @xmath6 and @xmath5 vertices . to describe the @xmath5 decay radius distribution , it is assumed that the reconstruction efficiency is uniform to a certain radius and then drops down exponentially .",
    "a clear peak at a radius of 1.7 cm corresponds to the @xmath5 s which interacted with nuclei in the be tube .",
    "this peak has two contributions - @xmath5 regeneration into @xmath6 with @xmath6 decay length seen afterwards and @xmath5 inelastic scattering with two charged tracks seen in the final state .",
    "the combination of the described processes was used to fit the experimental distribution and seems to describe it well enough . the vertex spatial resolution obtained from the @xmath6 decay length distribution",

    "this selection is shown in figure  4d by the shaded histogram and demonstrates that the peak at the be tube survives with 20@xmath265 events and 35 @xmath5 decays in flight remain , still 10 times more than the expected number of cp violating decays .",

    "the coherent contamination is expected to be small and can not be extracted .",
    "for the calculation of the cross sections , the number of the initial @xmath5 passing the be tube multiplied by the reconstruction efficiency @xmath43 can be found from the distribution of figure  4b using the expression : +   + @xmath44 , +   + where @xmath45 is the visible number of pairs at a zero radius ( fit value from the flat region in figure  4b ) and @xmath46=350 cm is the decay length for the @xmath5 .",
    "the value @xmath47=0.78 is the probability for a @xmath5 to have a pair of charged particles after decay .",

    "+   + to estimate the total cross section , the relative weight of these reactions was found to be 0.21 from the nucrin package @xcite . using the cmd-2 experimental @xmath56 value and a ratio @xmath57 = 0.52 @xcite",
    ", one can estimate @xmath58 = 641 @xmath26 238 mb .",
    "a systematic error of this estimation is about 30@xmath19 and comes from uncertainties in the event selection and in the ratio above .",
    "the selection of candidates for @xmath4 events faced two problems .    first is a background from the dominant @xmath5 decays .",
    "simulation gives a rejection factor of only 0.03 for the given dc resolution , and the ratio of the number of events within our cuts ( away from the beam pipe ) to the total number of @xmath5 decays , 35/1355 , is consistent with this result .",
    "however , the expected rate of @xmath34 decays is @xmath59 , so that only 3 true @xmath34 events could be expected in the sample .",
    "the observed events are mainly from the semileptonic decays of @xmath60 , and to improve the achieved rejection and select @xmath61 events better angular and momentum resolution in the dc is needed .",
    "the effect of tightening resolution may be illustrated by selecting events within 1.5 standard deviations of the detector resolution .    in this case 9.5@xmath263.4 of the original events remain under the peak at the pipe and only 5 @xmath5 decays in flight remain ( 2 of them should be real @xmath29 events ) .",
    "dc resolution better by a factor of 2 expected for the rest of our data , could give a signal / background ratio about 1 or better .",
    "a second problem is the relatively high background from nuclear interactions of @xmath5 and the regeneration effect .",
    "the obtained cross sections can be compared to the data available at higher momenta and with theoretical expectations .",
    "there are no data for the regeneration cross section for be and for slow kaons .    in figure",
    "[ kskl3.fig]a the experimental regeneration cross section is plotted together with the theoretical calculations performed in @xcite . the obtained cross section is consistent with calculations . the calculated regeneration cross section for cu",
    "is also presented in the figure .",
    "the comparison of the calculated regeneration cross sections for these two different materials shows that at momenta below 200 mev / c one can not scale them by a simple @xmath62 dependence . to verify these theoretical calculations",
    "one needs experimental measurements for different materials .",
    "+    [ kskl3.fig ]    the experimental angular distribution of the regenerated @xmath6 after background subtraction is presented in figure  [ kskl3.fig]b together with the fit function and the theoretical prediction @xcite and seems to be a little narrower than the expectation .",
    "this result for the total nuclear cross section in be for 110 mev / c kaons can be compared to the experimental data at higher momenta @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "such comparison is presented in figure  6 .",
    "the cross sections extracted from gheisha and fluka simulation codes are also shown .",
    "it is seen that the fluka code , as well as the calculations from @xcite give cross sections in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the gheisha code gives completely wrong absolute values as well as momentum dependence .",
    "after publishing our preliminary results @xcite , the regeneration influence was discussed for the @xmath12 measurement planned in kloe detector@xcite .",
    "a possible way to remove regeneration events is to require that the final state particles lie in a plane ( since for regeneration events , recoil nucleons will carry a momentum ) .",
    "it was shown that the total regeneration probability in the kloe drift chamber after an acoplanarity cut ( factor of 4 rejection ) was @xmath63 that should be compared with @xmath64 probability for the `` normal '' cp violating @xmath65 decay and @xmath66 probability for the expected direct cp violation decay .",
    "the regeneration itself does not give any decay asymmetry expected for the direct cp violating @xmath5 decay , but the acoplanarity cut as well as other selection cuts applied separately to @xmath67 and @xmath68 final states with a different resolution ( dc for the first and calorimeter for the second ) can cause a systematic asymmetry due to the broad angular distribution of the regenerated events .",

    "with the cmd-2 detector the coupled @xmath3 decays from the @xmath1 have been observed for the first time at an @xmath69 machine .    the attempt to select @xmath70 events emphasized again problems of the @xmath71 decay mode background as well as a high level of nuclear interactions of neutral kaons including @xmath5 into @xmath6 regeneration .    the regeneration and total nuclear interaction cross sections for low momenta neutral kaons have been measured .",
    "the measured values of the cross sections indicate that regeneration will cause an additional background for the cp - violating decays of @xmath5 at the @xmath1-factory experiments and should be carefully studied to avoid systematic errors .",
    "comparison of the obtained total cross section with the predictions of the simulation codes gheisha , fluka and calculations performed in @xcite shows that gheisha results are wrong while two other codes are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the opening of this kinematic region for studies of the neutral and charged kaon interactions has been an additional argument for the construction of @xmath1-factories and the detector finuda @xcite has been proposed for these studies at the @xmath1-factory in frascati@xcite .",
    "we anticipate that the results obtained from the data now in hand will be important in planning of experiments at @xmath1-factories .",
    "the analysis of new experimental data is in progress and we expect new results on the nuclear interaction cross section .",
