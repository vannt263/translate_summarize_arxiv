    "nowadays , with the standard cosmology the famous fundamental question ,  where did it all come from ? \" still it does not have a convincing answer , reason why a new description is necessary .",
    "cosmologists during long time have believed that quantum cosmology can shed light on this question @xcite but some issues are in controversy , e.g. the lack of an intrinsic time variable in the theory @xcite , the validity of the minisuperspace approximation , the problem of cosmological boundary conditions @xcite , to mention something . among the proposals trying to outline a possible answer to the fundamental question , the so - called brane world scenaries ( bws ) @xcite became a promising way to understand the birth and then the evolution of our universe .",
    "grounded on the proposal that our universe can be thought as a 4-dimensional spacetime object embedded in an n - dimensional spacetime , the main physical idea behind of bws is that the matter fields are confined to a 3-dimensional space ( brane ) while the gravitational fields can extend into a higher - dimensional space ( bulk ) , where the graviton can travel into the extra dimensions .",
    "originally proposed to resolve the hierarchy problem , bws has been applied to a great diversity of situations such as dark matter / energy , quientessence , cosmology , inflation and particle physics . on other hand , at the formal mathematical level , related applications of embedding theory such as generation of internal symmetries , quantum gravity and alternative kaluza - klein theories have been exploited @xcite . in the cosmology context",
    "there are predictions of these ideas , that could be tested by astronomical observations what constitutes one of the several reasons for which it is so attractive , so that it has predictive power @xcite .    in these brane",
    "world programs , gravity on the brane can be recovered by compactifying the extra dimensions @xcite or by introducing an ads background spacetime @xcite .",
    "however , dvali , gabadadze and porrati @xcite ( dgp ) showed that , even in an asymptotically minkowski bulk , 4-dimensional gravity can be recovered if one includes a brane curvature term in the action .",
    "furthermore , dgp considered the @xmath0 reflection symmetry with respect to the brane getting that gravity , is 4-dimensional on smaller scales than a certain scale , or it is 5-dimensional on larger distances @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that reflection symmetry is not the only possibility in these models . with regard to the last",
    ", several works have been devoted to antisymmetric cases @xcite , for instance , when the brane is coupled to a 4-form field @xcite . in a pionner work ,",
    "brown and teitelboim worked out the process of membrane creation by an antisymmetric field motivated by schwinger process of pair creation induced for the presence of a electric field @xcite .",
    "garriga @xcite has also studied the creation of membranes for this field in a ds background .",
    "others authors have been interested in brane world creation in ads spacetime or in other particular situations @xcite but , upon our knowledge , nobody has been devoted to the nucleation of brane world universes ( bwu ) induced by a 4-form field besides a brane curvature term included in the action .",
    "generally , bws are studied mostly for ads / ds as well as empty ( minkowski ) backgrounds . in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss the nucleation of bwu with a curvature term induced by a 4-form field in a ds background spacetime .",
    "we get the friedman like equation when 5-dimensional gravity is fixed and perform geometric hamiltonian analysis in order to obtain , by means of canonical quantization , the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "the setup for the induced brane production is as follows .",
    "there is an external homogeneous field that produces a brane ; then , the natural question there , is : what is the probability of such process ? in the present paper we calculate the creation probability for a brane universe embedded in a de sitter space , produced by a 4-form potential gauge field in the same way that the standard electromagnetic potential bears to a charged particle . in its quantum analisys",
    "we shall use a wkb approximation attaining the same results by an instanton method .",
    "we could try to answer the question of which one of the universes arose is the more probable universe produced in this model and if our universe is one of them , or could be a very special universe .",
    "parameters of this model must be constrained by cosmological requirements like nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the equations of motion of a brane with matter and curvature term that lives in a ads / ds or minkowski bulk when there is no @xmath0 symmetry and , by means of a limit equivalent to the presence of a 4-form field in a fixed background the corresponding equations .",
    "a geometric hamiltonian approach is done in sec .",
    "iii , where the fundamental canonical structure is obtained and the canonical constraints are listed .",
    "the next step is specialize the general canonical analysis to the case of a spherical 3-brane floating in an @xmath1 background spacetime which is the issue of sec .",
    "the last provides the preamble to obtain the wdw equation in the canonical quantization context , which is done in sec .",
    "v. the creation probability is calculated in sec .",
    "vi by two methods , the first is an instanton approach and the other one by means of a wkb approach for barrier tunneling of the wdw equation . finally in sec .",
    "vii , we present our conclusions as well as some perspectives of our work .",
    "the effective action that we are interested in the brane world model corresponds to a 3-brane with a intrinsic curvature term considered from its worldsheet and no @xmath0 symmetry in the presence of a fixed background spacetime .",
    "we consider the following action @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for matter lagrangians for the bulk and the brane , respectively . in our case , we will consider those as cosmological constants .",
    "the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the brane plank and bulk masses .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the dimension of the bulk .",
    "the respective equations of motion for the brane are @xcite , @xmath10\\gamma_{a   b } - [ k_{ab}]&= & k{\\cal t}_{ab } , \\\\ { \\widetilde{t}}^{ab } < k_{a b } > & = & [ { \\cal t}_{nn } ] , \\\\ \\nabla_{a } ( t^a { } _ b ) & = & -[\\widetilde{t}_{b n } ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature of the brane , @xmath12 denotes the worldsheet metric .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projections onto the worldsheet of the bulk energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the square and angular brackets represent the difference and the average of the corresponding embraced quantity , on the two sides of the brane , respectively , i.e. , @xmath16 = k^+ _ { ab } - k^- _ { ab}$ ] and @xmath17 , where ` + ' and ` - ' denote the exterior and interior of the brane .",
    "taking into account that the bulk energy momentum tensor has the form @xmath18 and by means of the generalized birkhof theorem , the 5-dimensional frw metric can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the metric of a 3-sphere , @xmath22 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath23 is the mass .",
    "furthermore , in the cosmic time gauge the 4-dimensional metric on the brane reduces to @xmath24 using the junction conditions , and due to we have isotropy and homogeneity in ( [ eq : ds5 ] ) , matter can be parametrized completely via a perfect fluid brane energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 so the relevant equations of motion for the model are the following @xmath26 last equation represents the energy - momentum conservation on the brane .",
    "the former system was discussed in @xcite where several interesting cases were treated .",
    "suppose now @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and consider at the same time , the limits of fixed bulk gravity , @xmath29 and , @xmath30 but satisfying the following relation @xmath31 so , expanding the second term of the lhs of eq .",

    "the hamiltonian framework has been a fundamental prop in the study of the dynamics of field theories besides of appoint oneself a preliminary step towards canonical quantization in physical theories .",
    "knowingly of previous fact , canonical quantization is the oldest and most conservative approach to quantization which we would like to develop in order to attain the quantum cosmology emerged from our bwu model . to carry out the previous thing , we must begin by casting the theory in a canonical fashion",
    ", then we shall proceed to its quantization .    to begin with",
    ", we are going to mimic the well known adm procedure for canonical gravity to get a hamiltonian description of the brane .",

    "then we shall proced to identify the several geometric quantities inherent to the hypersurface @xmath38 .",
    "the adm decomposition of the action , computation of the momenta as well as the recognition of the constraints are the succesive stages .      leaning in results achieved in @xcite",

    ", we would like to glimpse onto the adm decomposition of some important geometric quantities defined onto the branes in our geometrical approach . in the appendix we have included notation and some important facts for embedding theories to have reference of the material useful through the paper .",
