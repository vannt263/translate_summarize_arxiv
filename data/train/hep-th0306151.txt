    "much of this work has been done within the so - called braneworld scenarios , where all the low - energy excitations except for gravity are confined to a brane , embedded in the simplest case in five - dimensional anti de sitter space ( @xmath0)@xcite . it has been shown that in this type of model , gravity behaves in the large distance limit as ordinary @xmath1 dimensional gravity@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that in the limit where the energy density on the brane is small , the standard four - dimensional cosmological evolution on the brane is recovered with calculable corrections that become relevant at high densities@xcite .",
    "given this starting point , there exist a number of ways to proceed toward constructing a more complete cosmological model . perhaps the most conservative route is to postulate an epoch of inflationary expansion on the brane .",

    "this initial state decays through quantum tunneling by forming bubbles filled with anti de sitter space@xcite .",
    "if the true vacuum is discretely degenerate , the collision of two such bubbles results in the formation of a domain wall interpolating between two different such vacua .",
    "this is our braneworld .",
    "if the tension of this local brane is tuned to balance the negative cosmological constant in the bulk , the cosmology for an observer situated on this brane is virtually identical to that for a randall - sundrum model .",
