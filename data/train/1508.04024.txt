    "<S> a recently proposed model of social interaction in voting is investigated by simplifying it down into a version that is more analytically tractable and which allows a mathematical analysis to be performed . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis clarifies the interplay of the different elements present in the system  social influence , heterogeneity and noise  and leads to a better understanding of its properties . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of a regime of bistability is identified . </S>",
    "<S> the insight gained in this way gives further intuition into the behaviour of the original model .    * </S>",
    "<S> 1  introduction *    there is a growing appreciation of the importance of social influence in voting @xcite , and convincing experimental evidence of the phenomenon has recently been produced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a detailed understanding of the process and its implications is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> systems of interacting elements can display complex , sometimes counter - intuitive , behaviour @xcite , making mathematical analysis highly useful to understand the properties of such systems .    </S>",
    "<S> there are already a number of studies modelling voting as a social influence process , for example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these tend to consider rather simple models that intend to capture , in a stylised manner , some aspects of the voting process or to reproduce some observed regularity . </S>",
    "<S> a different approach was taken in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a collaboration between social scientists and computational modellers led to the creation of a complex computational model of voter turnout . </S>",
    "<S> there is a tendency for the former approach to be taken by physicists , who have a tradition of gaining intuition through the use of simple models in their own subject . on the other hand , the latter approach is frequently favoured by social scientists , who wish to include all aspects which they feel may have an influence on the system . </S>",
    "<S> this difference in approach has the unfortunate consequence of leading to the formation of two groups of modellers whose models have little in common , and who have little incentive to communicate .    in a previous paper  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we started to address this issue by forming a bridge between the two methodologies . </S>",
    "<S> this consisted of constructing an intermediate model which was between the two types described above . </S>",
    "<S> the philosophy behind this is discussed in some detail in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but we had several goals in mind . </S>",
    "<S> one was simply to attempt to bring together the two communities described above , by formulating a model which had features of both perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> another was to develop the methodology of forming such intermediate models . </S>",
    "<S> the actual procedure we adopted in constructing the new model consisted , very broadly , of beginning from the complex model of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and systematically eliminating certain features which did not have a marked effect on the outcomes of simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we would not necessarily expect that a single intermediate model would be able to bridge the large gap between complex models and the models favoured by physicists , and therefore we instead envisage there being a sequence of intermediate models , each less complicated than the previous one , while retaining sufficient features in common with its ` neighbours ' in the model sequence , that any similarities and differences between them can be systematically studied and the reasons behind these understood . in the context of models of voter turnout which interest us here </S>",
    "<S> , we will denote the most complex model of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as model 1 and the simplified version of this model discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as model 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to create a further model in the sequence , denoted as model 3 , which comes near to being a model of the type preferred by physicists , in that it is sufficiently simple to allow some mathematical analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the method used to reduce the model complexity also uncovered a number of phenomena which were difficult to detect in model 1 ( simply because of its sheer complexity ) , and revealed several mechanisms required for these phenomena to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> one such phenomenon was the existence of a single control parameter ( the ` influence rate ' ) that largely controlled the levels of voter turnout in the model . </S>",
    "<S> when the influence rate was low , simulations of model 2 always resulted in low voter turnout . </S>",
    "<S> conversely for large influence rates , voter turnout was always high . </S>",
    "<S> for intermediate values of the influence rate , the reduced model displayed bistability , so that different runs of the same model with the same parameters and initial conditions could , by chance , give either a high or a low turnout . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of the further simplified model 3 should allow us to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , </S>",
    "<S> we first give an overview of the differences between the previous two models ( more detail is given in the appendices ) , describe the new model ( model 3 ) and then give the results of simulation which show that the predictions of model 2 and model 3 are qualitatively similar . </S>",
    "<S> having established this essential requirement of model 3 , we go on to mathematically analyse it in section 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude in section 4 with a summary and a look to the future .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2  formulation *    model 1 is a complex agent - based computational model of voting , developed to incorporate the evidence suggested in the social science literature . </S>",
    "<S> this model describes the inhabitants of a neighbourhood or small city , and consists of a population of agents that occupy the sites of a square lattice , with sites corresponding to houses , workplaces , schools and other places of activity . </S>",
    "<S> the agents have a large number of characteristics ( including age , ethnicity , interest in politics and ` civic duty ' ) and are subjected to many processes ( including ageing , moving house , finding jobs and having children ) . </S>",
    "<S> these processes modify some of the agents characteristics and allow them to make links to other agents , creating a social network . </S>",
    "<S> agents also initiate ( political ) conversations over this social network , with a probability that depends on their political interest . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the conversations they receive affect their political interest and allow civic duty to spread between agents . </S>",
    "<S> agents civic duty ( together with other elements ) determines their propensity to vote in a series of periodic elections . </S>",
    "<S> agents can leave the simulation by dying or emigrating and new agents are created via births and immigration . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the model can be found in @xcite . a schematic representation of the model is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : om ] .        in a recent </S>",
    "<S> work , model 1 was distilled into the more compact model 2 . by neglecting some of the more complicated components of model 1 , </S>",
    "<S> model 2 allowed us to investigate the effects of different mechanisms , and to explore the parameter space in a more efficient way . </S>",
    "<S> a major simplification of model 2 was ignoring all processes that form links between agents , setting instead a social network with appropriate characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> other elements , such as those regarding party preference and development of children , were also neglected . </S>",
    "<S> model 2 achieved a large simplification ( of the order of a factor @xmath0 in computational efficiency @xcite ) whilst maintaining good agreement with model 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the relatively complex model 2 is given in appendix  [ appendixmodel2 ] .    in this section </S>",
    "<S> we will push the model - analysis process forward . </S>",
    "<S> we will start by formulating model 3 , a simpler version of model 2 that is more suitable for mathematical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> some of the simplifications we will make will involve formulating processes in a more standard form so that checking the output of these against those from model 2 enables us to draw conclusions that are robust with respect to the implementation details .    in model 2 , social influence ( the key mechanism in the model ) </S>",
    "<S> is implemented using two main variables : interest level and number of conversations remembered . </S>",
    "<S> the interest level determines the propensity of an agent to initiate conversations . in turn , the interest level of an agent is determined by the number of their received conversations ( together with their minimum interest level ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversations are forgotten with some probability every year . </S>",
    "<S> a further complication is that agents with zero interest level have different dynamics , until their number of ` background ' conversations remembered exceeds a given threshold ( see appendix  [ appendixmodel2 ] for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we will simplify model 2 in three main ways to create model 3 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly we will use the same dynamics for all interest levels ( thus ignoring the difference in model 2 for agents with interest level zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we will use a single variable for the influence process , which we call the ` interest state ' , that increases with each received conversation and decreases appropriately , rather than one variable for interest level and a different one for conversations remembered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will uncouple the dynamics of the interest state from that of voting . </S>",
    "<S> while in model 2 agent s voting behaviour affects their probability to initiate conversations ( turnout - conversations feedback in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f : om ] ) , this feedback will be neglected in model 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> this formulation is more suitable for mathematical analysis and will allow us to see the interplay of the different elements of the model in a more transparent way . </S>",
    "<S> we define model 3 below .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2.1  model 3 definition *    the model consists of a population of @xmath1 agents . </S>",
    "<S> agents enter and leave the model via immigration - emigration and birth - death . for simplicity we keep the population size constant , by matching each death event by a birth and every emigration by an immigration . </S>",
    "<S> agents age throughout the simulation and their age determines their death probability . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2th agent is characterized by three dynamic variables : ( political ) interest state , @xmath3 ; civic duty , @xmath4 ; and voting habit , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , agents have two fixed characteristics : their ` intrinsic interest ' state , @xmath6 ; and their level of education , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the interest state , @xmath3 , is the primary dynamic variable in the model , controlling how often the agent initiates conversations , and depending on the number of received conversations . </S>",
    "<S> civic duty , @xmath4 , ( spread through conversations ) and voting habit , @xmath5 , are binary variables that together determine the probability of an agent voting . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the intrinsic interest state determines the minimum value that the interest state variable may take for that agent , and the education modulates the probabilities of acquiring or losing civic duty .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the model dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> * at each time step each agent initiates @xmath8 conversations   then @xmath9 conversations are realised , where @xmath10 denotes the integer part of @xmath11 . if @xmath12 is not a natural number , then @xmath13 . ] , where @xmath14 is a binomial random variable for the number of successes from @xmath1 trials , each with probability @xmath15 of success . </S>",
    "<S> * for each successful conversation another agent , @xmath16 , is picked at random ( corresponding to a fully connected underlying network ) and the receiving agent increases their interest state [ @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> conversations can lead to the spread of civic duty in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> if a conversation takes place from an agent , @xmath2 , with civic duty to an agent , @xmath16 , without it , and agent @xmath16 s interest state is larger than some threshold , @xmath18 , then they gain civic duty with probability , @xmath19 , dependent on whether they voted in the last election . * </S>",
    "<S> each time step , after all conversations are completed , every agent has a probability @xmath20\\gamma$ ] to decrease their interest state by one . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the absence of received conversations an agent s interest state will decay to their intrinsic interest state over a time - scale of order @xmath21 . in addition , agents lose civic duty with a probability @xmath22 so that civic duty decays over a time - scale of order @xmath23 ( typically @xmath24 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * elections take place with periodicity @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> an agent will vote with probability ( 1-@xmath26 ) if they have civic duty or voting habit , and will otherwise not vote . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 is the probability of not voting , despite having the intention to vote , due to `` confounding factors '' , for instance illness or having recently lost employment . </S>",
    "<S> an agent voting in three consecutive elections acquires voting habit , and loses this habit if they fail to vote in two consecutive elections .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus mainly on a fully connected underlying network to ease the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> by initially ignoring network effects we can better understand the main properties of the model . </S>",
    "<S> network effects are considered at the end of section 3 .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2.2  comparing model 2 and model 3 *     ( the influence rate ) , we plot @xmath27 time series from @xmath28 to @xmath29 years . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 and other parameter values are given in appendix  [ appendixparam].,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( the influence rate ) , we plot @xmath27 time series from @xmath28 to @xmath29 years . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath30 and other parameter values are given in appendix  [ appendixparam].,title=\"fig : \" ]    model 2 ( with an underlying fully connected network ) and model 3 outputs are compared in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparing ] . for each value of the influence rate , @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath27 different time series from @xmath28 to @xmath29 years , corresponding to different realisations of the process . due to the non - standard nature of this figure </S>",
    "<S> , we stress again that each of the ten collection of points that is seen in the figures represent time series running from @xmath28 to @xmath29 years . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that there are essentially two regimes , one with a small number of conversations and low turnout , obtained for low values of influence rate , and another with a large number of conversations and high turnout , for higher values of the influence rate . </S>",
    "<S> these two regimes are connected by a region of bistability , in which , for the same parameter values and initial conditions , some realisations converge to the ` high - communication ' regime and some to the ` low - communication ' one ( which regime is achieved is a random outcome arising from the stochasticity of the process ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the results are similar when plotting the variables civic duty or voting habit .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comparing ] that results of model 3 and model 2 show good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the number of conversations are very close for the two models . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the two models is that model 3 gives a slightly smaller voter turnout . in the low - communication regime , this is primarily due to the simplifying assumption in model 3 that individuals with zero interest state follow the same dynamics as those with higher interest states ( which is not the case in model 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a smaller number of agents being susceptible to acquiring civic duty . in the high - communication regime , </S>",
    "<S> the difference in turnout is mainly due to the assumption in model 3 that the probability , @xmath26 , of an agent not voting in spite of having civic duty or voting habit , does not depend on age . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast in model 2 , the probability of an agent with civic duty or voting habit not voting is smaller for younger agents , so that agents in model 2 are slightly more likely to build habit , leading to higher levels of voting ( the aforementioned zero - interest effect is less important in this regime because almost no agent has interest state equal to zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation is confirmed by simulations which include these elements . despite these small quantitative differences , model 2 and model 3 are qualitatively very similar .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3  analysis *    we would like to understand the origin of the low- and high - communication regimes and the bistability region , as well as the mechanisms required to observe these features . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , we will perform a general mathematical analysis of model 3 . </S>",
    "<S> because the interest state dynamics is unaffected by the voting dynamics and yet interest and voting are closely correlated , we conclude that the interest state dynamics is the main driver of the system , and will focus our analysis on the interest state dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the process is a discrete - time analogue of the following system of continuous - time birth and death stochastic processes : @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33\\gamma$ ] ( note that if @xmath34 initially then @xmath35 is always positive ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will analyse this continuous - time version for mathematical convenience .    in order to make analytical progress </S>",
    "<S> , we will assume that @xmath36 is time - independent . </S>",
    "<S> this is suggested by applying the central limit theorem , since @xmath36 is the sum of @xmath1 independent random variables divided by @xmath1 ( the central limit theorem does not strictly apply here , since the @xmath37 variables are not independent , so the time - independence of @xmath36 is an assumption ) , and it is supported by numerical simulations with large @xmath1 . with the constant @xmath36 assumption , ( [ schema ] ) implies that the variables @xmath38 follow independent linear birth and death processes . at steady state , we have @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are poisson random variables with mean @xmath42 ( independent for different values of @xmath16 ) .    under the constant @xmath42 assumption , inserting eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ poissons ] ) in the definition of @xmath42 , we obtain the following self - consistent equation : @xmath43 we can re - write the sum in ( [ self - consgen ] ) grouping agents with the same value of the minimum interest state , @xmath44 : @xmath45 with @xmath46 equal to the set of indices of agents that have intrinsic state equal to @xmath44 , @xmath47 . assuming that @xmath46 is large for every @xmath44 ( _ i.e. </S>",

    "<S> ( [ self - consgen ] ) leads to : @xmath54 equation ( [ self - consnice ] ) displays the key elements in the system and it is the main result of this section . </S>",

    "<S> the simulation - based results corresponding to the lower transition were determined as the minimum value of @xmath12 for which some realisations reach the high - communication regime , taking as initial condition a population with the maximum interest state ; the results corresponding to the upper transition were determined as the maximum value of @xmath12 for which some realisations stay in the low - communication regime , taking as initial condition a population with the minimum interest state . </S>",
    "<S> we see that , for reasonably large values of @xmath73 , the bistability disappears much sooner in the simulations than in the theoretical predictions </S>",
    "<S> . this might be due to the fact that , while , in the deterministic limit , the solution corresponding to the low - communication regime still exists , its relative stability ( and its basin of attraction ) is low and the noise pushes the system to the ` high - communication ' solution . </S>",

    "<S> it is interesting to compare model 3 with other models of social influence . </S>",
    "<S> threshold models of collective behaviour @xcite form probably the simplest class of models showing similar phenomenology . in these models , </S>",
    "<S> an agent participates in an activity if some proportion of the population ( the agent s threshold ) also does so . </S>",
    "<S> bistability can appear when the population is homogeneous ( the threshold distribution is sharply peaked around a given value ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model is similar to this class in that different agents require different amounts of social input in order to show the same level of activity ( due to different intrinsic interests , @xmath44 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the random - field ising model @xcite , which can also be used to model social phenomena @xcite , shows similar phenomenology , with multi - stability arising for small disorder and low noise . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the local fields of the random - field ising model would correspond to intrinsic interest of our model . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredients of all these models are a heterogeneous population and a nonlinear influence function .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have assumed a fully connected interaction network . </S>",
    "<S> the results can , however , change qualitatively when a different type of interaction network is used . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the network in model 3 are the same as those obtained for model 2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that the bistability region can disappear , with the relevant variables increasing in a smoother way , when the interaction network becomes sparse or strongly clustered . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is reminiscent of that found in random field ising models in which sparser networks tend to require higher interaction strength for bistability to occur @xcite . from the perspective of our analysis , adding a network leads to conversation inputs that fluctuate more between agents . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an extra source of heterogeneity in the equation for @xmath42 ( that in this case should be replaced by @xmath74 ) that further smooths the interaction function @xmath55 , which results in a smaller region of parameter space in which bistability occurs . we note that since we expect real systems to be heterogeneous this result suggest that bistability may not be widespread in real - world systems .    * 4  conclusions *    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the power of a method of model reduction involving generating a chain of increasingly simpler models . </S>",
    "<S> beginning from a complex model ( model 1 ) , and a previously published reduced model ( model 2 ) , we have created a further reduced model ( model 3 ) and shown that it agrees quantitatively and qualitatively with model 2 . since the relationship of model 2 to model 1 has been previously investigated , we thus have a clear link between results derived and understood in model 3 to equivalent effects found in the original complex model , which in turn explicitly models mechanisms believed to be important in real world voting processes .    </S>",
    "<S> we have described some advantages of this approach in the introduction , but one of the most compelling is that it combines the best of two worlds : the simplicity appreciated by those trained in the physical sciences , but having an input from the many effects included in complex models . </S>",
    "<S> a central point is that , although the models constructed through this procedure are ` simple ' , in the sense that they have far fewer parameters than the models they are derived from and are more amenable to analysis , they will typically have features that would not have been guessed at if one started from simple models and then added further complexity . </S>",
    "<S> this is the strength of the approach : model 1 contains within it a large amount of social science data and expertise , and a diluted form of this is retained in model 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct translation of the methods used in physics would be to start with a minimal model , progressively introducing new structure and at every stage comparing the new model with data . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the process we have described here is more directly suited to the social sciences , with its relative paucity of data . </S>",
    "<S> however the conventional physical sciences approach can still have a role after the various stages of models have been created . </S>",
    "<S> one could also attempt to go from model @xmath75 to model @xmath76 , and in this way explore a wide range of possible models by going up and down the various stages . in this way one should be able to gain a fuller appreciation of the role that various extra structures have in giving a more complete description of the system .    to demonstrate the utility of creating a model that is amenable to mathematical analysis we have used model 3 to investigate the origins of the bistability seen in model 2 , and the existence of high and low turnout regimes found in both model 2 and model 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation allowed us to understand the mechanisms required for bistability to exist , and provided an explanation for the observed dependence on the homogeneity of the population and the structure of the social network when one is used . </S>",
    "<S> this was a specific illustration of the use of this method in models of voter turnout , but we believe that the present approach of using a chain of increasingly simple models can be fruitful for the analysis of a wide variety of complex systems .    </S>",
