    "from a computational point of view , it is natural to consider a subbase of a second - countable @xmath3 space @xmath0 as a collection of primitive properties of @xmath0 through which one can identify each point of @xmath0 . in this way , by fixing a numbering of the subbase , one can represent each point of @xmath0 as a subset of @xmath4 and construct a domain representation of @xmath0 in the domain @xmath5 of subsets of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath5 is isomorphic to the domain of infinite sequences of the sierpinski space @xmath6 .    on the other hand , each regular open set @xmath7 ( i.e. , an open set which is equal to the interior of its closure ) of a topological space @xmath0 divides @xmath0 into three parts : @xmath7 , the exterior of @xmath7 , and their common boundary .",
    "therefore , one can consider a pair of regular open subsets which are exteriors of each other as a pair of primitive properties and use a subbase which is composed of such pairs of open sets in representing the space .",
    "such a subbase is called a dyadic subbase and a dyadic subbase of a space @xmath0 induces a domain representation of @xmath0 in the domain @xmath8 of infinite sequences of @xmath9 . in @xcite and @xcite",

    ", we derive from a dyadic subbase @xmath12 a domain ( i.e. , an @xmath13-algebraic pointed dcpo ) @xmath14 and a bounded complete domain @xmath15 which are subdomains of @xmath10 containing @xmath16 as subspaces .",

( 1 ) if @xmath0 is a strongly nonadhesive hausdorff space ( definition [ def - ad ] ) , then the set @xmath17 of limit ( i.e. , non - compact ) elements of @xmath14 has minimal elements . ( 2 ) if @xmath0 is regular , then @xmath11 is an embedding of @xmath0 in the set of minimal elements of @xmath17 .",

    "we study properties of representations for second - countable hausdorff spaces and investigate which property holds under each of the above - mentioned conditions .",
    "therefore , a space in this paper means a second - countable hausdorff space unless otherwise noted .",
    "we are mainly interested in the case where @xmath0 is a regular space because the corresponding domain representations have good properties as we mentioned above .",
    "in addition , it is proved in @xcite that every second - countable regular space has a proper dyadic subbase and in @xcite that every dense - in - itself second - countable regular space has an independent subbase , which is a proper dyadic subbase with an additional property .",
