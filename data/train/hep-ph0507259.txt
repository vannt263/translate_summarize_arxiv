    "it is well known that the condition ( c ) is not satisfied in the sm with the current higgs mass bound , and that the @xmath5 violating phase in the kobayashi - maskawa matrix is too small to generate the sufficient baryon asymmetry . here",

    "the 2hdm is a simple extension of the sm by adding the second higgs doublet . in this model ,",

    "we only consider the finite and zero temperature effective potentials using high temperature expansion to understand the qualitative feature .",
    "as we have done in the case of the 2hdm , we consider the relationship between the magnitude of the phase transition and the deviation of the @xmath38 coupling from the sm value .",
    "the combined result is approximately expressed as @xmath68 where @xmath63 is the one - loop renormalized mass of the lightest higgs boson and @xmath69 is the contribution of the light stop loop to the cubic term in the finite temperature effective potential . from the condition ( [ sph ] ) , the deviation in the @xmath38 coupling from the sm value is estimated to be @xmath70 for @xmath50 gev . in the mssm , the condition of the sphaleron decoupling also leads to the large deviation of the @xmath38 coupling from the sm prediction at zero temperature .",
