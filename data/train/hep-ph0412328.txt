    "as a basis for the discussion which follows , i adopt the following version of the current `` experimental situation '' with regard to reported pentaquark resonances :    * a significant number of medium - energy experiments report positive evidence for the @xmath0 .",
    "its existence is thus plausible",
    ". if these experiments are correct , the @xmath0 mass and width are @xmath3 mev and @xmath4 mev .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a critical assessment of both positive and negative experimental searches , as well as references to the experimental literature . * the na49 exotic @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath2 ) signal with @xmath7 mev and narrow width",
    "@xcite has not been confirmed  @xcite , and is hard to reconcile with high statistics @xmath6 production experiments  @xcite .",
    "though a @xmath2 partner is unavoidable if the @xmath0 lies in a @xmath1 , in view of the experimental situation , no assumption will be made about its mass . * the h1 report of an anticharmed baryon at @xmath8 mev  @xcite is also unconfirmed  @xcite , so no assumptions will be made about the masses of any possible heavy pentaquark states .    a low - lying , relatively narrow ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath1 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 exotic baryon is natural in the chiral soliton model ( csm )  @xcite . in the quark model",
    ", the ground state of the exotic system would have negative parity ( @xmath12 ) if all five particles were in a symmetric relative s - wave configuration .",
    "whether such a configuration represents the true model ground state , however , is a dynamical question .",
    "exciting one of the four light ( @xmath13 ) quarks into a p - orbit , reducing the @xmath14 spatial symmetry from @xmath15_l$ ] to @xmath16_l$ ] , allows spin - flavor - color configurations with significantly increased hyperfine attraction which were previously pauli - forbidden .",
    "if the increased attraction is greater than the p - wave excitation cost , the ground state will have @xmath17 .",
    "a dynamical calculation is needed to determine which of the two effects wins out .",
    "two proposals of possible @xmath17 quark model configurations for the @xmath0 have received considerable attention , and are also useful for framing the discussions below .",
    "the jaffe - wilczek ( jw ) ansatz for the @xmath0  @xcite involves two @xmath18 , @xmath19 diquark pairs , coupled to color @xmath20 , with only confinement forces between the diquarks and @xmath21 .",
    "bose statistics for the diquarks imply a relative p - wave between them , hence @xmath22 .",
    "the karliner - lipkin ( kl ) scenario for the @xmath0  @xcite involves one jw diquark and one @xmath23 triquark . in the triquark , the spin and color of a jw diquark",
    "have been flipped and anti - aligned with those of the @xmath21 , producing triquark quantum numbers @xmath24 .",
    "the ansatz is motivated by the color - magnetic - exchange model , in which the hyperfine attraction is stronger for the kl than for the jw correlation",
    ". a relative diquark - triquark p - wave will yield @xmath22 . in both scenarios ,",
    "the relative intercluster p - wave is assumed to make cross - cluster interaction and antisymmetrization ( asn ) effects negligible .",
    "the `` gb model '' is a model with spin - dependent interactions generated by effective goldstone boson exchange .",
    "the spin - dependent part of the hamiltonian is @xmath25 with @xmath26 the pauli spin matrices , @xmath27 the constituent quark mass , @xmath28 the @xmath29 gell - mann matrices , and @xmath30 as given in ref .",
    "the jw diquark is by far the most attractive @xmath31 correlation for @xmath32 . if the sum in eq .",
    "( [ hgb ] ) runs only over quark labels  @xcite , the model also matches the jw assumption for the @xmath33 interactions .",
    "assuming an orbital excitation cost similar to that in the ordinary baryon sector of the model , the gain in hyperfine energy in the @xmath16_l$ ] configuration leads to a @xmath17 ground state , one which should be dominated by the jw correlation .",
    "the model thus provides a dynamical setting for studying ( i ) corrections to the strict jw scenario ( e.g. , cross - cluster asn / interaction effects , configuration mixing ) and ( ii ) the pattern of excitations above the jw - correlation - dominated ground state .",
    "the `` cm model '' is a model with spin - dependent interactions generated by effective color magnetic exchange .",
    "the spin - dependent part of the hamiltonian is @xmath34 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 as above , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for quarks ( antiquarks ) the @xmath37 gell - mann matrices and @xmath38 a smeared delta function .",
    "the jw diquark is again the most attractive @xmath31 correlation , but , as noted above , the more complicated kl configuration lies lower than the jw configuration .",
    "the cm model thus provides a dynamical setting for studying ( i ) corrections to the kl scenario and ( ii ) the expected excitation pattern above the cm ground state .",
    "an important correction results from the fact that the same @xmath33 interactions responsible for lowering the kl triquark hyperfine energy also mix the jw and kl corelations , producing a configuration significantly lower than either the jw or kl correlations separately .",
    "this configuration turns out to be a roughly equal admixture of the two correlations  @xcite .",
    "space constraints prevent discussion of all points covered in the conference talk .",
    "( see the conference website and refs .",

    "@xcite , in particular , gives an explicit definition of the dimensionless form used in quoting results below . ) _",
    "( a ) the @xmath0 mass and pentaquark widths in the quark model : _ models such as the gb and cm models , with parameters fixed from the ordinary baryon sector , can not predict exotic pentaquark masses because of the absence of terms representing the response of the non - perturbative vacuum to the hadronic constituents . this response will differ depending on the number of constituents .",
    "this effect will be absorbed by the additive constant used to set the overall scale in each sector ; the constant should thus be different for ordinary and pentaquark baryons , just as it is for mesons and baryons . in the bag model ,",
    "where some modelling of vacuum response _ does _ occur , the difference in 1-body energies between a single @xmath39 bag and two isolated @xmath40 bags is an extremely sensitive function of the @xmath41  @xcite , suggesting it is impossible to anticipate in advance the size , or even sign , of this effect .",
    "thus , the fact that quark model calculations for @xmath42 _ using parameter values fixed from the ordinary baryon spectrum _",
    "yield masses @xmath43 mev or so too high does not rule out the validity of a pentaquark picture for such states . other observables ( widths , splittings , relative decay couplings )",
    "must be used to test the models .",
    "if the @xmath0 is well described as a pentaquark , the initial and final states in @xmath44 have the same number of constituents .",
    "the decay thus proceeds by rearrangement , or `` fall - apart '' , and should have a width @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the width for a @xmath47 potential scattering resonance with mass @xmath42 in an attractive potential of roughly hadronic size , and @xmath48 is a spectroscopic , or squared - overlap , factor  @xcite .",
    "a single - scale s - wave attractive potential too weak to bind does not produce resonant behavior  @xcite ; hence a @xmath49 assignment for the @xmath0 is impossible . for a p - wave ( d - wave ) decay , @xmath50 ( respectively , 20 ) mev .",
    "the spin - flavor - color ( jfc ) part of the overlap suppression is 1/24 for the jw correlation and @xmath51 for the optimized jw / kl combination in the cm model  @xcite . with additional suppression from the spatial overlap , @xmath0",
    "widths @xmath52 a few to several mev are expected for @xmath17 ground states involving such correlations . as for the csm",
    ", some fine tuning is needed to reduce this to @xmath53 mev or less .",
    "( a very narrow @xmath0 is natural for a @xmath54 assignment , where a d - wave @xmath55 decay is required .",
    "however , at least in the gb and cm models , such a ground state assignment is impossible  @xcite . )",
    "the jfc `` overlap '' suppression effect is rather general in the quark model approach . in the soft-@xmath56/pcac approximation ,",
    "the @xmath57 coupling is @xmath58 .",
    "three of the light quarks in the @xmath0 must project onto the @xmath59 and the remaining constituent @xmath60 and @xmath21 be annihilated by the pseudoscalar density with @xmath61 quantum numbers .",
    "the jfc factors are the same as would occur in a @xmath0 to @xmath55 overlap calculation using a constituent @xmath62 picture for the @xmath61 .",
    "a model calculation  @xcite confirms the reduction of @xmath63 to @xmath64 mev for the jw correlation , before inclusion of spatial overlap effects , and can be interpreted as a model - dependent version of the soft-@xmath56/pcac estimate . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath17 pentaquarks with p - wave fall - apart decays , decay coupling ratios should be given by the corresponding overlap ratios squared .",
    "_ ( b ) corrections to the jw and kl scenarios in the gb and cm models : _ for the gb model , @xmath65 in the strict jw limit is @xmath66 .",
    "the lowest - lying @xmath17 state has jw quantum numbers ( which , up to a @xmath67 spin - orbit partner , are also the csm ground state quantum numbers ) .",
    "cross - cluster interaction / asn and configuration mixing lower the actual ground state expectation to @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the jw approximation is reasonable , but not exact .",
    "the ground state expectation _ is _ , however , the same in the @xmath0 and heavy @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) sectors , as in the jw scenario . with the jw estimate for the 1-body contribution to @xmath71  @xcite",
    ", the jw prediction of strong interaction stable @xmath72 is thus preserved . for the cm model , in the @xmath0 sector",
    ", the optimized combination of jw and kl correlations provides a good approximation to the lowest @xmath17 eigenvalue  @xcite , which again occurs for the channel with csm quantum numbers . in the heavy sector , the @xmath73 interactions are strongly suppressed by the @xmath74 factor in @xmath75 .",
    "this ( i ) decreases the kl triquark hyperfine attraction , making the kl diquark - triquark configuration higher in energy than the jw correlation for both @xmath76 , and ( ii ) strongly suppresses kl - jw mixing .",
    "the heavy pentaquark @xmath17 ground state should thus be dominated by the jw correlation .",
    "the jw expectation is @xmath77 , c.f .",
    "the actual ground state expectation @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "the jw approximation is again reasonable , but not exact .",
    "the kl scenario for the heavy quark analogues  @xcite assumes the same triquark - diquark clustering as for the @xmath0 persists in the heavy system .",
    "this assumption is _ not _ compatible with the cm model effective interactions , which motivated the original triquark - diquark proposal .",
    "the kl heavy sector ansatz thus leads to an overestimate of the @xmath72 masses in the cm model .",
    "modified estimates put the @xmath72 close to the @xmath79 , @xmath80 strong decay thresholds  @xcite .    _",
    "( c ) splittings and relative decay couplings in the light and heavy @xmath17 @xmath69 sectors : _ though one can not predict absolute pentaquark masses in the quark model approach , splittings are independent of any additive constant and hence _ are _ predictable .",
    "predictions for a given @xmath69 sector ( with @xmath81 fixed ) are particularly immune to uncertainties in treating 1-body energies , and are on the same footing as analogous predictions for the ordinary baryon sector .",
    "the relative ordering of states is fixed by the jfc structure of the effective operators , with ( in a given sector ) an overall scale , dependent on the size of the pentaquark states .",
    "_ ratios _ of overlap factors relevant to the decays to @xmath82 , with @xmath83 the relevant ground state baryon and @xmath84 the relevant vector or pseudoscalar meson , are also well - determined  @xcite .    for the gb model ,",
    "the first excitation above the @xmath17 , @xmath69 ground state , for all of @xmath81 , is a degenerate pair with @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the total intrinsic spin .",
    "the excitation energy is @xmath87 mev .",
    "no other states are expected within @xmath88 of the ground state . for the @xmath89 state",
    ", the combination of phase space and squared - overlaps enhances the width to @xmath55 by a factor of at most @xmath90 c.f .",
    "the @xmath0 , making this prediction potentially problematic . a similar , potentially problematic , state with @xmath91 , mass @xmath92 mev above the @xmath0 , and relatively narrow ( @xmath93 mev ) @xmath55 width , is also predicted in the csm  @xcite . for the cm model , in the @xmath94 sector ,",
    "a single low - lying @xmath95 excitation is predicted @xmath96 mev above the @xmath0 .",
    "the next excitation lies @xmath97 mev higher .",
    "phase space and the overlap factor for @xmath89 state s decay to @xmath55 are again such that a relatively narrow width is expected .",
    "even more problematic are the predictions in the heavy sector , where _ five _ low - lying excitations are expected , with @xmath98 , @xmath89 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath89 , the first @xmath101 mev above the ground state , and the last @xmath102 mev above the ground state  @xcite .",
    "such a dense , low - lying excitation spectrum seems unlikely , but would be a striking prediction of the cm model , if confirmed .",
    "none of the overlap ratios are such as to allow any of these low - lying states to be experimentally undetectable in 2-body decay modes , provided at least one of either them , or the ground state , is experimentally accessible  @xcite .    for the gb model , the jw dominance of the ground state and decrease in jw diquark hyperfine energy under @xmath103 imply a reduction in @xmath2 hyperfine energy c.f .",
    "the @xmath0 . an estimate of the splitting , using only the @xmath15_{fj}$ ] component in the @xmath2 wavefunction , yields @xmath104 mev  @xcite",
    "allowing other wavefunction components ( known to be small for the @xmath0 , but expected to be more important for the @xmath2 ) will lower this value . in the kl scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath2 have almost identical @xmath105 values , leading to @xmath106 mev  @xcite .",
    "the lowest hyperfine eigenvalues in the @xmath0 and @xmath2 channels turn out to share this near equality , even though the ground state is not well approximated by the kl correlation .",
    "the cm model thus produces a significantly smaller @xmath107 splitting than does the gb model .",
