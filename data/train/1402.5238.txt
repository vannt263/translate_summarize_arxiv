    "revealing the mass accretion process onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is crucial for understanding the nature of agns because it is believed that the mass accretion fuels a smbh , supports its nuclear luminosity , and presumably powers its outflow .",
    "given the simplest approximation of an axisymmetric adiabatic accretion flow onto a smbh , bondi ( 1952 ) derived a black hole accretion power @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bondi accretion rate which is defined at the sphere of gravitational influence of the smbh ( i.e. , the bondi radius @xmath12 ) .",
    "the active galaxy m 87 , one of the well - known llagns , possesses a huge black hole mass @xmath13@xmath14 ( macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2011 ; walsh et al .",
    "2013 ) with a prominent relativistic jet 10@xmath15 for the black hole mass in this paper . ] .",
    "the estimated jet power is in a range between @xmath16 to @xmath17 erg s@xmath9 ( li et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) and seems to match fairly well with the overall energetics described by the bondi accretionyr@xmath9 is adopted here . ]",
    "( @xmath18 erg s@xmath9 ) at @xmath19 pc . however , the central core of m 87 is highly under - luminous in the x - ray band and its x - ray luminosity is smaller than @xmath20 by five orders of magnitude ( @xmath21 erg  s@xmath9 ; di matteo et al .",
    "the low x - ray luminosity implies the existence of radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) and/or a substantial decrease of the mass accretion rate @xmath22 at radii @xmath23 .    the theory of riafs , such as the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf : ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) , convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf : narayan 2000 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) , and adiabatic inflow - outflow solution ( adios : blandford & begelman 1999 ) was developed over the last decades .",
    "the resulting mass accretion rates toward an smbh normalized by the bondi accretion rate can be scaled as a function of the spherical radius as @xmath24 with @xmath25 . considering the viscosity parameter @xmath26 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , solutions of classical adafs suggest a mass accretion rate from @xmath12 to @xmath27 that is comparable to @xmath11 : @xmath28 ( gadaf stands for `` giant '' adaf ; narayan & fabian 2011 ) . on the other hand , cdafs exhibit a substantial decrease of the mass accretion rate toward @xmath29 as @xmath30 ( igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ) .",
    "the adios , which generalizes the adaf model by including the disk wind , can take intermediate values of @xmath31 anywhere between 0 ( adaf ) and 1 ( cdaf ) .",

    "we note that the submm wavelengths are more advantageous than other radio bands for determining the rm because the bandwidth depolarization is less significant , and the opacities of the accretion flow and the jet are smaller so that one can probe regions closer to the bh .",
    "however , efforts to determine the @xmath33 of agns ( including m 87 ) have never been undertaken except for sgr a*.    for m 87 , all previous efforts on measuring the rm primarily focused on either the jet or radio lobes at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "owen et al . ( 1990 ) found rm values of a few thousands rad / m@xmath5 at lobes ( interpreted as arising from a foreground faraday screen ) and of a few hundreds rad / m@xmath5 in the kiloparsec - scale jet .",
    "more recently , algaba et al .",

    "parsec scales , junor et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found an average rm of @xmath1@xmath24400 rad / m@xmath5 with regions that show both positive and negative signs .",
    "zavala & taylor ( 2002 ) found similar results and explained the origin of the observed rm with foreground medium not directly associated with the jet . to our knowledge ,",
    "no mm / submm polarization observations for examining rm toward m 87 have been conducted .    in this letter , we present the first measurement of rm toward the m 87 nucleus at submm wavelengths .",

    "we show our main results .",
    "the estimation of @xmath6 , the discussion on the preferred riaf models , and alternative interpretations of rm are presented in section 4 .",
    "m 87 was observed in the 230 ghz band on 2013 january 23 with the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho et al .",
    "the observation was conducted with seven antennas in the extended array configuration .",
    "the weather condition was excellent during the observation with an atmospheric opacity @xmath39 .",
    "the total length of time on m 87 was 8 hours .",
    "the sma receivers operate in double sideband mode with each sideband having a width of 4 ghz .",
    "each sideband was further split into a pair of 2-ghz - wide intermediate frequency ( if ) sub - bands .",
    "we centered those ifs at 230.3 and 232.3 ghz in the upper sideband ( usb ) and at 218.4 and 220.4 ghz in the lower sideband ( lsb ) , respectively .",
    "the sma polarimeter was used to sample all four polarized correlations ( ll , lr , rl , and rr ) by switching polarization between the left - hand and right - hand circularly polarized feeds in period with 16 walsh function patterns . a detailed discussion of the sma polarimetry system is given in marrone ( 2006 ) and marrone & rao ( 2008 ) .",
    "we performed initial flagging and calibrations including the flux , bandpass , and gain calibrations in the mir - idl package developed for the sma .",
    "we conducted polarization calibration , imaging , and data analysis in the miriad package ( wright & sault 1993 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was done with measurements of callisto , and we performed bandpass , amplitude , and phase calibration with frequent observations of the quasar 3c279 , which is 19@xmath40.2 away from m 87 . to perform polarization calibration , we observed 3c279 and 3c84 over a large range of parallactic angles and solved for quasar polarization and leakage terms .",
    "the average values of the instrumental polarization ( d - terms ) or `` leakage '' were approximately 1@xmath22% in the upper sideband and 4@xmath25% in the lower sideband .",
    "the leakage terms derived from 3c279 and 3c84 were in excellent agreement with each other .",
    "we estimated the accuracy of the leakage terms to be @xmath10.5% .",
    "after deriving the d - terms , we corrected the gain of m 87 data by self - calibration ( phase - only ) techniques in order to increase the dynamic range , and then applied polarization leakages .",
    "we performed imaging and deconvolution with i , q , u , and v imaged individually for each if band in each sideband , leading to four sets of i , q , u , v images .",
    "the final synthesized beams for the continuum images are 1``.2@xmath30''.8 ( corresponding to @xmath1 ( 1.7 @xmath3 1.0 ) @xmath310@xmath4@xmath41 ) .",
    "finally , we used the task impol in miriad along with the q and u maps to derive total linearly polarized intensity and distribution of the electric vector position angles ( evpa ) .",
    "the magnetic field distribution of m 87 were obtained by rotating the evpas by 90@xmath42 .",
    "in figure 1 we show a sample stokes images of m 87 in the 232.3 ghz band .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnetic field distribution .",
    "one can see that the magnetic vector orientations are perpendicular to the jet in knots a and c and parallel in knot b. this is in good agreement with polarization characteristics derived from observations at centimeter wavelengths and optical band ( e.g. , owen et al . 1989 , perlman et al . 1999 ) , indicating the robustness of our polarization observation and calibration . in table 1",
    ", we show the i , q , u fluxes , polarization fractions , and the evpa of the m 87 core for each of the four bands in the observation . in the following",
    ", we will interpret the change of the polarization position angle @xmath0 as a result of _ external _ faraday rotation associated with accretion flow .",
    "the reason why we prefer this interpretation will be explained in section 4.2 .",
    "faraday rotation changes the observed @xmath0 as a function of observing wavelength @xmath43 according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the intrinsic polarization angle and rm is the rotation measure .",
    "we determine the rm of the m 87 core by fitting the polarization position angle ( @xmath0 @xmath46 0.5@xmath47(u / q ) ) from four independent frequencies within the sma band based on the q and u maps from the observation .",
    "the q and u values for rm are measured by taking the peak fluxes of the q and u maps , with the image rms uncertainty as the measurement error for q and u. the uncertainty in @xmath0 is calculated from an error propagation of the q and u uncertainties .    0''.8 .",

    "the best - fit rm is @xmath2(2.1@xmath521.8)@xmath310@xmath4 rad / m@xmath5 .",

    "since we are interested in an upper limit of the mass accretion rate , which is derived from the upper - limit ( absolute value ) of rm ( see section 4.1 ) , we use 7.5 @xmath3 10@xmath4 rad / m@xmath5 for rm in the following discussion .",
    "and @xmath54 are the inner and outer edge of the faraday screen in the accretion flow where the electrons are sub - relativistic and the magnetic field is coherent . ]      to constrain @xmath6 with rm , we essentially follow the procedure outlined in marrone et al .",
    "the primary assumption in this method is that the hot accretion flow in front of a source of synchrotron emission causes faraday rotation .",
    "the model also assumes that the density profile of the accretion flow follows a power - law distribution ( @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 ) and that the magnetic field is well ordered , radial and of equipartition strength .    in the case of m87",
    ", we further assume that the _ innermost _ jet ( i.e. its base ) provides the dominant background polarized emission in the submillimeter band ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "note that while polarized emission could be emitted along the jet all the way from close to the bh to radii beyond @xmath12 , the dominant polarized emission at 230 ghz most likely originates from the jet base .",
    "this is because the majority of our sma flux density ( 1.6 jy ) can be explained by the emission from the jet base at the center of m87 .",
    "based on the vlbi observation of m87 at 230 ghz , doeleman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that the jet base has a flux density of 1 jy and a size of 5.5@xmath41 . by using the core - shift relationship ( hada et al .",
    "2011 ) , nakamura & asada ( 2013 ) determine the offset of the jet base from the bh at 230 ghz to be 4.3@xmath41 ( in projected distance ) .",
    "therefore , these studies imply that the dominant background emission quite likely originates from within a few @xmath41 from the bh .",
    "nonetheless , we currently can not exclude the possibility of polarized emissions from the diffuse part of the jet , and this issue will be addressed with future high - resolution observations .    based on equation ( 9 ) in marrone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we express @xmath6 as a function of rm as @xmath58^{-2/3 } \\times \\left ( \\frac{m_{\\rm bh}}{6.6\\times 10 ^ 9 m_{\\odot}}\\right)^{4/3 } \\left ( \\frac{2}{3\\beta-1}\\right)^{-2/3 } r_{in}^{7/6 } rm^{2/3 } ~\\rm rad / m^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a parameter depending on the accretion flow models ( @xmath59=1/2 @xmath2 3/2 accounts for all varieties of accretion models ) . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the inner and outer edge of the faraday screen ( in units of @xmath27 ) where the electrons are sub - relativistic and the magnetic field is coherent .",
    "we remark that the electrons within @xmath60 make a small or negligible contribution to rm because they become relativistic ( i.e. @xmath62 k=@xmath63 ) and rm is , thus , suppressed ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .    in order to derive @xmath6 with the above equation , it is important to determine @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we estimate @xmath60 based on the observed flux density of m87 from vlbi observations . as we described above , thermal electrons within @xmath60 become relativistic and can emit significant synchrotron radiation that dominates the emission from the accretion disk ( yuan et al .",
    "since it is expected that a hot accretion flow would be optically thick at cm wavelengths , the size of the region with relativistic plasma can be constrained by using the observed flux density and brightness temperature .",
    "for m 87 , the observed total flux density of the nucleus is 1 jy from the vlbi observation at 43 ghz ( abramowski et al .",
    "since the brightness temperature of the hot electrons within @xmath60 must be at least 6@xmath310@xmath64 k , the diameter ( i.e. 2  @xmath60 ) of the emitting region of relativistic plasma can be constrained to be @xmath65 0.32 mas (= 42@xmath27 ) .",
    "since the observed flux density sets an upper limit on the amount of emission from relativistic electrons , it leads to an upper bound on @xmath60 of 21@xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , if the innermost jet resides right in front of the the emitting region of the relativistic plasma and the emission from the hot electrons is totally absorbed by the optically thick jet , we can not constrain the size of the region of the relativistic plasma directly from the observed flux .",
    "however , we can use the size of the innermost jet to constrain @xmath60 .",
    "the observed size of the vlbi core at 43 ghz is 17 @xmath52 4r@xmath66 ( asada & nakamura 2012 ) . if the emission from the hot electrons is totally absorbed , @xmath60 must be smaller than 17 @xmath52 4r@xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the 21@xmath27 upper bound for @xmath60 is reasonable even for this case .",
    "we fix @xmath61 to be at the bondi radius @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is just a convenient value to choose while @xmath61 is not well determined .",
    "this is a reasonable choice because @xmath6 is insensitive to @xmath61 , and @xmath6 will only change by a factor of order unity even if @xmath61 @xmath67 @xmath12 . with these values",
    ", our new measurement of rm sets an upper limit @xmath6 of 9.2 @xmath310@xmath7 m@xmath8  yr@xmath9 at 21@xmath27 for @xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to 7.4 @xmath3 10@xmath69 @xmath11 , which is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the bondi accretion rate .",
    "this value implies that the mass accretion rate is significantly suppressed while material is accreted and falling in from @xmath12 to 21@xmath27 .",
    "determining @xmath6 provides an effective way to constrain accretion flow models because each model has its own unique @xmath6 profile .",
    "the adaf model requires @xmath6 to be comparable to @xmath11 from @xmath12 all the way to @xmath70@xmath1@xmath27 , while the adios and the cdaf models require suppression of @xmath6 as ( @xmath71)@xmath72@xmath11 , where @xmath70 is the radius from the bh with 0 @xmath73 @xmath31 @xmath73 1 for adios and @xmath74 for cdaf .",
    "since our new results suggest significant suppression of @xmath6 at the radius of 21@xmath27 , they disfavor the possibility of a classical adaf and prefer adios / cdaf .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the findings from nearly all numerical simulations ( yuan et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the maximum radiative power that can be extracted from mass accretion is @xmath75 @xmath46 @xmath76 @xmath77 7 @xmath310@xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 erg  s@xmath9 , where @xmath79 is the radiative efficiency . with our upper limit of 9.2 @xmath310@xmath7 m@xmath8",
    "yr@xmath9 (= 7.4 @xmath3 10@xmath69 @xmath11 ) , the maximum radiative power is estimated to be 5 @xmath3 10@xmath81 erg  s@xmath9 if @xmath82 .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude larger than the observed x - ray luminosity @xmath83 of 7@xmath310@xmath84 erg  s@xmath9 , suggesting that the current limit of mass accretion rate is sufficient to explain the observed x - ray luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity is low compared to the maximum available nuclear power .",
    "if @xmath6 is not significantly lower than the upper limit obtained here , this will imply that the radiative efficiency is significantly lower than the canonical value of 0.1 . in this case , both mass accretion rate and radiative efficiency are significantly suppressed which is consistent with the expected properties of riafs .",
    "our upper limit on the rotation measure is derived from a set of polarization position angles ( pa ) with still significant errors .",
    "because of the large uncertainties , it is difficult to demonstrate that pas follow the @xmath85 law , which is the basis of our fundamental assumption on the location of the faraday screen ( relative to the background source ) . as a result , we can not completely rule out the scenario that @xmath86 faraday rotation ( i.e. faraday screen intermixed with emitting plasma in the jet ) plays an important role and the possibility that we are measuring an rm purely originating from cold electrons in the sheath of the jet , especially because the jet in m87 points to the observer nearly along the line of sight ( i.e. @xmath73 20@xmath40 ) .    to assess the possibility of a jet - based rm",
    ", we adopt the burn model ( burn 1966 ) on internal faraday rotation and depolarization . by using the degree of linear polarization of the m87 core from the current study ( 1 % ) and that from the optical measurements ( 1%-13% ; perlman et al .",
    "2011 ) , we find that the maximum possible observed rm for the jet at 230 ghz is @xmath16@xmath310@xmath87 rad / m@xmath5 , beyond our current upper limit .",
    "therefore , a jet - originated rm could provide an explanation for our observed rm .",
    "nonetheless , in the context of our simplified one - dimensional model for spherically symmetric riafs , we still prefer the scenario that the faraday rotating plasma ( i.e. accreting gas ) is external to the emission region because the dominant polarized emission quite likely comes from within a few @xmath41 from the bh ( see section 4.1 ) . in this case , since all the non - relativistic electrons reside beyond @xmath121@xmath41 from the black hole , the faraday screen must be external to the background source .",
    "in essence , in order to constrain @xmath6 more unambiguously with the method used in this letter , it is important to establish the @xmath85 law of pa and obtain a more precise rm .",
    "this will rely on higher sensitivity observations with a significantly longer lever arm in the frequency space and higher angular resolution in the future .",
    "the sma is a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics .",
