    "high spatial resolution images obtained with the hubble space telescope revealed the presence of small nuclear stellar disks in several early type galaxies ( van den bosch et al . 1994 ; van den bosch , jaffe & van der marel 1998 ) as well as patchy absorption due to dust near their nuclei ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",

    "although this galaxy is often regarded as the prototype for its morphological type , there have been several suggestions that it may actually be a face - on s0 galaxy ( capaccioli 1987 ; nieto 1989 ) or at least a flattened elliptical ( strom et al .",

    "elliptical galaxies have central surface - brightness distributions of two distinct types : those with steep profiles that do not show a break in the slope  called `` power - law '' galaxies ; and those that do show a break at a given radius @xmath20 , from a steeper outer profile to a flatter core  called `` core '' galaxies ( lauer et al . 1992 , 1995 ; crane et al . 1993 ; ferrarese et al .",

    "( 1997 ) as a `` core '' type galaxy , and in addition to the characteristic luminosity profiles , we found that the hst v and i images reveal a well defined nuclear dust structure ( see figure  [ viimages_fig ] ) , similar to that observed in the e2 galaxy ngc6251 ( ferrarese & ford 1999 ) . the presence of such nuclear dust disk raises the possibility that the observed central luminosity profile could be altered by absorption , creating an artificial break and mimicking a `` core '' type profile . to analyze the role that the dust plays on the luminosity profile",
    ", we carried out detailed surface photometry of the central region of ngc3379 using the iraf task ellipse to measure the main isophotal parameters ( position angle , ellipticity and fourier coefficient @xmath21 ) .",
    "the fitting results are shown in figure  [ isofit_fig ] as a function of the distance @xmath22 in arcsec , along the isophotal major axis .",
    "the position angle of the major axis presents an almost constant value of 75  between 2  and 13 , decreasing slightly to 70  for larger distances . within the inner 2 , on the other hand , the pa changes considerably , first decreasing to lower values of up to 50  at @xmath22 @xmath7  1 , and then increasing again to reach a value of pa = 120  at 04 , which is close to the orientation of the dust disk s major axis .",
    "the isophotes external to 5  show a constant ellipticity with a value of 0.12 , but internal to this radius the ellipticity increases to up to 0.24 at 05 .",
    "it is very significant that the changes in both the pa of the major axis and the ellipticity of the isophotes start at approximately 2 , in close correspondence with the presence of the dust disk .",
    "the @xmath21  parameter is related to the shape of the isophotes : ellipticals with `` core '' profiles tend to present `` boxy '' isophotes ( @xmath21  @xmath23 0 ) , while `` power - law '' galaxies tend to be more disk - like ( @xmath21  @xmath24 0 ) ( nieto , bender & surma 1991 ) . in ngc3379 , the @xmath21  parameter external to 2assumes an almost constant value of zero , while internal of this radius it first rises to positive values up to @xmath22 @xmath7  12 and then oscillates around zero in the innermost regions .",
    "such behaviour indicates that , outside the region where the dust disk is present , this galaxy has indeed almost perfectly elliptical isophotes , and that the dust affects the very inner isophotes making them appear more disk - like where they would be expected to be `` boxy '' based on the classification of ngc3379  as a `` core '' galaxy ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ; kormendy 1999 ) .",
    "the derived v and i luminosity profiles along the major axis at pa = 70  show evidence of a change in slope at @xmath2 @xmath7  07 . in order to verify",
    "if this depression could be attributed to the presence of the dust disk , we performed the ellipse fitting with the region occupied by the disk masked - out , and found the same profiles as in the previous case ( without masking ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of dust has a negligible effect on the profiles .",
    "the change in the profile slope makes necessary to use two different laws for the fitting :     from 008 to 068 , where the profiles are shallower , a cuspy law was used :    @xmath25     from 068 to 15 , the srsic law ( srsic 1968 ) provides a better fit :    @xmath26 \\right\\ }   \\label{eq : sersic } \\\\ b_{n } & = & 0.868 n - 0.142 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the resulting parameters of the fit are shown in table [ phot_tab ] .",
    "figure  [ photv_fig ] shows the observed ( star symbols ) and fitted profiles ( solid line ) from the v image .",
    "the interval 07 @xmath27 9  is well reproduced by a srsic law with index @xmath28 , indicating that the profile is more concentrated than the usual de vaucouleurs light distribution , which fails to reproduce the observed luminosity .",
    "the very inner region ( @xmath29 07 ) is expanded in the zoomed insert to the right , where it can be clearly seen where the srsic law breaks up and the nuclear profile dominates .",
    "the fitted srsic profile was assumed to represent the stellar light distribution for @xmath11  10 , and a model image was built using the iraf task bmodel .",
    "this model was then subtracted from the v image and the result is shown in the left panel of figure  [ colourvi_fig ] . for @xmath30 07 ,",
    "where the `` cuspy '' law dominates , the nuclear core appears now very clearly in absorption , since its profile is @xmath31  0.2 mag fainter than the external profile extrapolation .",
    "the subtraction also reveals a very conspicuous dust structure at @xmath32  15 , reminiscent of the dust disk seen in ngc6251 ( ferrarese & ford 1999 ) .",
    "the  color - index image , shown in the right panel of figure  [ colourvi_fig ] , confirms the presence of dust disk with major and minor axes 3and 08 long , respectively , with the major axis oriented along pa @xmath3  125 . assuming that the disk is circular , the observed axial ratio implies an inclination of 77  between the line of sight and the normal to the disk .    from our data",
    ", we measured a mean @xmath33 extinction of 0.11 mag inside the disk . assuming that the dust is in a uniform layer with @xmath32 15 ( 105 pc ) and is composed mainly of silicate grains with mean size 0.08@xmath34 m , a dust mass of 150 @xmath4  was estimated following the method discussed in ferrari et al .",
    "the analysis in that paper also indicated presence of a more extended , asymmetric dust cloud extending about 5  to the south , with an estimated mass of @xmath7  100@xmath4 , and mean @xmath33 extinction of 0.027 mag .",
    "the much larger mass and extiction measured in the disk over that of the southern extended dust cloud , indicates the presence of a dust gradient towards the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the fit of the i band luminosity profile yields very similar results , as can be seen in table [ phot_tab ] and figure [ photi_fig ] .",
    "since the i band should be less affected by reddening , the presence of the central cusp in the i profile shows that absorption by dust can not be the primary cause for the observed change of slope .",
    "the isophotal parameters discussed above indicate that dust indeed plays a role in distorting the inner isophotes , but it is not a strong enough effect to modify the global luminosity profiles .",
    "this galaxy therefore presents a characteristic `` cuspy '' core , with the steeper outer ( srsic ) profile breaking up at @xmath20 @xmath3  07 to be replaced by a shallower inner profile , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : core ] with @xmath35 = 0.21",
    ". note that the profile break is located about 08 from the most absorbed part of the dust disk , and therefore the light depletion observed in the luminosity profile can not be explained by dust absorption , since it is not present where this latter is stronger .",
    "this same conclusion is reinforced by the  color - index image ( fig .",
    "[ colourvi_fig ] ) , where only the dust ring is visible , evidencing that the central cusp is not an effect of localized absorption .",
    "several models have been proposed to account for core formation , such as : a ) an isothermal sphere with density profile @xmath36 ; b ) black holes ( bh ) adiabatically grown in homogenous isothermal cores ( young 1980 ; van der marel 1999 ) ; c ) the orbital decay of massive black holes acreted in mergers , where the decaying bhs may heat and eject stars from the center , eroding the power - law if any exists and creating a core ( faber et al . 1997 and references therein ) ; or d ) remnants formed by mergers of disk galaxies , where the dissipation in the gas and ensuing star formation during the merger process leaves a dense stellar core in the remnant ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) .",
    "these last models can account for the extra light at small radius ( over a srsic or de vaucouleurs functions ) in the luminosity profile of `` power - law '' type galaxies ( kormendy 1999 ) , but can not reproduce the broken light profile observed in ngc3379 , which is fainter than the srsic distribution in the inner region .",

    "( 1998 ) constructed dynamical models for a sample of 36 early - type galaxies , including ngc3379 , using hst photometry and ground - based kinematic data .",
    "the models assume that the galaxies are axisymmetric , described by a two integral distribution function , with an arbitrary inclination angle , a position - independent stellar mass - to - light ratio , and a central massive dark object ( mdo ) of arbitrary mass .",
    "such approach was able to provide acceptable fits to 32 galaxies in the sample , and a model with an mdo mass of 3.9 @xmath5  @xmath16 @xmath4   and a mass - to - light ratio @xmath37 of 5.3 was found to be an adequate description for the stellar kinematics of ngc3379 . in a similar approach , gebhardt et al .",

    "also required the presence of a central mdo with mass of 6 @xmath5  @xmath16  @xmath4 .",
    "recently , van der marel ( 1999 ) studying the models first proposed by young ( 1980 ) of adiabatically grown black holes , predicted that the luminosity profiles should behave as @xmath38 for asymptotically small radii , but as @xmath39 at radii observable with hst , with the index @xmath35 increasing monotonically with the mass of the central object .",
    "the index @xmath35 can assume all the observed values and therefore , both `` core '' and `` power - law '' profiles can be reproduced .",

    "<S> subtraction of the underlying stellar component represented by the fitted srsic profile revealed the presence of a small ( @xmath2 @xmath3  105 pc ) dust disk of about 150 @xmath4 , oriented at pa = 125  and inclined @xmath3  77  with respect to the line of sight . </S>",

    "<S> the stellar rotation in the inner 20  is well represented by a parametric planar disk model , inclined @xmath3  26  relative to the plane of the sky , and apparent major axis along pa @xmath3  67 . </S>",
    "<S> the gas velocity curves in the inner 5  show a steep gradient , indicating that the gas rotates much faster than the stars , although in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity field of the gaseous system , however , is not consistent with the simple model of keplerian rotation sustained by the large ( 7 @xmath5  @xmath6 @xmath4  within a radius of @xmath7  90 pc ) central mass implied by the maximum velocity observed , but the available data precludes a more detailed analysis . </S>"
