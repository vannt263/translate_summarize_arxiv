    "using molecules as functional units for electronic device application @xcite is an interesting perspective and a possible goal of nano - electronics .",
    "work in this field has clearly demonstrated that many of the important molecular device characteristics relate specifically to a strong coupling between the _ atomic _ and the _ electronic _ degrees of freedom , for a popular introduction see reference @xcite . however , from a theoretical point of view , the accurate prediction of the properties of atomic and molecular scale devices  including the true i - v curves with as few adjustable parameters as possible  still represents a formidable challenge @xcite despite the advances and wide - spread application of large scale _ ab initio _ modeling based on the density functional theory ( dft ) over the last two decades    recall that most of the previous dft - based _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite solve only two kinds of problems : ( i ) finite systems such as isolated molecules and clusters , as in quantum chemistry ; ( ii ) periodic systems consisting of super - cells , as in solid state physics .",
    "however , a molecular electronic device is neither finite nor periodic .",
    "typically , it has open boundaries which are connected to long and different electrodes extending to electron reservoirs far away , and the external bias potentials are applied to these reservoirs . in other words ,",
    "calculations of finite or periodic systems do not include the correct boundary conditions for a nano - scale device in the quantum transport regime .",
    "therefore , a new formalism for electronic analysis is required to carry out the first principle transport modeling for molecular electronics .    in this article",
    ", we briefly outline a formalism that combines the density functional theory with the keldysh non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) so that non - equilibrium properties of the quantum transport regime can be predicted from atomistic approach without any phenomenological parameters @xcite . to show how it works , we apply our negf - dft approach to investigate a c@xmath0 molecule connected to two au electrodes .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows : in section [ theory ] , we present the negf - dft formalism and , in section [ results ] , we present the transport properties of the au - c@xmath0-au tunnel junctions and compare them with the properties of the al - c@xmath0-al ones .",
    "section [ summary ] is reserved for a short summary .",
    "the simplest model of a molecular device is schematically shown in figure [ device ] where a c@xmath0 molecule is contacted by two semi - infinite au electrodes which extend to @xmath5 where bias voltage is applied . to calculate the electronic states of such a device",
    ", two problems should be solved .",
    "first , the infinitely large problem ( due to the electrodes ) must be reduced to something manageable on a computer , _",
    "i.e. _ , one has to solve an open boundary problem .",
    "second , one has to find the charge density @xmath6 of the molecule and electrodes provided there is a bias voltage across the device , and this is a non - equilibrium problem . from the computational point of view , it is convenient to divide our system into three parts : a scattering region with some portion of electrodes and two metal electrodes extending to @xmath5 , as shown by the vertical lines in figure [ device ] .    to reduce the infinitely large problem to that defined inside the scattering region ( see figure [ device ] ) , we notice that the effective kohn - sham ( ks ) potential @xmath7 $ ] deep inside the left or right lead is very close to the corresponding bulk ks potential .",
    "this fact makes the boundary conditions to be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath8 where the planes @xmath9 are the left ( right ) limits of the scattering region ( see figure [ device ] ) , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known . in practice , within the dft , we only need to match the hartree potential @xmath12 $ ] at the boundaries .",
    "this can be accomplished by solving the poisson equation on @xmath13 by use of a 3d real space grid and boundary conditions at @xmath9 , and @xmath14 .",
    "once the poisson equation is solved , @xmath15 is matched , and by use of the dft we can show that @xmath16 is also matched . thus , equation ( 1 ) is valid .    in addition , the 3d real space poisson solver allows us to deal with any gate potentials , @xmath17 . in our model , they provide just additional boundary conditions for the electrostatics , so they change @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , once @xmath18 is matched across the boundaries , the charge density @xmath6 is automatically matched at the boundaries .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ device ] shows the charge density : although the densities in the leads and in the scattering region are calculated separately , they match perfectly across the boundaries .",
    "the above `` screening approximation '' @xcite allows us to reduce the infinitely large hamiltonian of the system to the effective finite one defined inside the scattering region . in this approximation",
    ", we neglected any influence the scattering region may give to the leads , but if the portion of the leads included inside the scattering region is long enough , such an approximation is well controlled . on the other hand , the semi - infinite leads do contribute to the scattering region , and this contribution is included through the self - energies @xmath19 in the green s function @xmath20 of the scattering region , for example , @xmath21 @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the kinetic energy of a valent electron , and the atomic cores of the scattering region are fixed in space and described by pseudo - potentials , so we have @xmath24 , and @xmath25= v_{\\rm h}^{}[\\,\\rho\\ , ] + v_{\\rm xc}[\\,\\rho\\,]$ ] is the effective ks potential obtained within the dft . for example , the exchange correlation potential @xmath26 is taken in a simple local form following the polynomial formula suggested in reference @xcite , and the ( retarded ) self - energies due to the semi - infinite left and right electrodes are calculated following an iterative technique described in references @xcite .",
    "however , to calculate the charge density @xmath6 away from equilibrium due to the bias voltage @xmath27 , we have to apply the negf method @xcite .",
    "the density matrix of the scattering region is calculated from the so - called lesser green s function @xmath28 of the scattering region as follows : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the retarded ( advanced ) green s function of the scattering region .",
    "note that @xmath31 is defined through the keldysh equation @xcite .",
    "the lesser self - energy @xmath32 $ ] can be evaluated within the mean field theory as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the retarded ( advanced ) self - energy of the left ( right ) electrode , and @xmath36 are the corresponding fermi distribution functions .",
    "note that @xmath37 $ ] is more than a simple fermi distribution : a fact reflecting the non - equilibrium nature of the problem , @xmath38 .",
    "in our numerical procedure , we use a lcao minimal _ s , p , d _ atomic basis set ( a real space fireball linear combination of atomic orbitals @xcite ) to expand the electron wavefunction and define the effective hamiltonian matrix @xmath39 : @xmath40\\ ] ] here , to calculate @xmath41 , the atomic cores are described by standard norm conserving nonlocal pseudo - potentials @xcite .",
    "we evaluate @xmath42 by direct matrix inversion , @xmath43 , and we construct @xmath6 from numerical evaluation of the integral in equation ( [ eq - noneq - green ] ) using a suitable contour in the complex plane @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "once @xmath6 is obtained , we evaluate the ks potential and iterate the above procedure , equations ( [ g_ret ] ) , ( [ poisson ] ) , and ( [ eq - noneq - green ] ) , untill numerical convergence is reached .",
    "thus , we construct the self - consistent @xmath6 by the negf technique ( it takes care of the non - equilibrium statistics ) and we calculate the hartree potential by solving the 3d poission equation directly ( equation ( [ poisson ] ) includes all the external fields as the electrostatic boundary conditions ) . as a result ,",
    "our negf - dft formalism is able to solve charge transport problems in addition to the conventional electronic structure calculations : we know both the density of states @xmath45 and the density matrix @xmath46 of the scattering region .",
    "moreover , we can easily calculate the electron charge on the molecule at nozero @xmath27 and @xmath17 .",
    "of course , the density matrix @xmath47 is normalized to the total number of valent electrons in the scattering region , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the overlap matrix of the atomic orbitals we use .",
    "then , one can introduce the ( average ) number of electrons in the molecule by calculating this trace over the molecular orbitals belonging to the molecule only : @xmath50 the difference between the calculated @xmath51 and @xmath52 of a free molecule can called an ( average ) excess charge on the molecule in the units of @xmath53 , @xmath54",
    "in this section we report our analysis on the transport properties of an au - c@xmath0-au molecular tunnel junction calculated by use of our negf - dft electronic package as discussed above .",
    "the device structure is shown in the upper panel of figure [ device ] . so far",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to investigate transport properties of c@xmath0 and other fullerene molecules @xcite .",
    "the device we present consists of the fullerene molecule c@xmath0 fixed in the middle of two gold electrodes . here ,",
    "we consider two distances between the electrodes , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this correspondes to the minimum distance between an au atom and c atom of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "each electrode consists of repeated unit cells with nine au atoms in the ( 100 ) direction and extended to infinity .",
    "note that we do not expect that the c@xmath0 molecule can be found in the coulomb blockade regime in such junctions if the electrode separation is small , say @xmath59 .",
    "the number of electrons in the molecule is not a good quantum number if the interaction with electrodes is strong .    the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics is calculated as follows : @xmath60\\,de \\,\\ , ,   \\label{current1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the transmission coefficient at the energy @xmath44 and bias voltage @xmath62 .",
    "the fermi distribution functions @xmath36 limit the integration in equation ( [ current1 ] ) to the small energy range @xmath63 at the fermi level of the electrodes ( in the zero temperature limit ) .",
    "transmission coefficient @xmath64 is calculated by use of the green s functions @xcite which we have already obtained as a result of the negf - dft self - consistent iterations , so we write @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{trans1}\\ ] ] here , the matrix @xmath66 is related to the line - widths resulting from the coupling of the scattering region to the left ( right ) lead . it is evaluated in terms of the corresponding self - energy matrices @xmath67 as follows : @xmath68 the retarded green s function of the scattering region @xmath69 is given as the following matrix : @xmath70 - \\sigma^{r}(e)\\,\\bigr)^{-1 } ,   \\label{green1}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] is the effective hamiltonian of the scattering region and @xmath72 is the total self - energy matrix . the density of state function is calculated from the density of state matrix @xmath73 as follows : @xmath74    for the au - c@xmath0-au junctions at @xmath75 , the density of states near the fermi energy is presented on figures [ dos1 ] and [ dos2 ] ( the fermi level is set to @xmath76 in this article ) .",
    "note that at positive gate voltages , @xmath77 , the energy levels originated from the lumo of c@xmath0 are partially occupied so they lie near @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( in the units of @xmath53 ) . at negative gate voltages , @xmath80",
    ", the energy levels originated from the heighest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of c@xmath0 begin to be depopulated , so the energy levels originated from the lumo of c@xmath0 are shifted far to the right from @xmath78 and @xmath81 ( in the units of @xmath53 ) .",
    "= 9.45 cm    = 9.45 cm    = 200pt    the transmission coefficient obtained from equation ( [ trans1 ] ) is presented on figure [ iv ] as a function of the electron energy @xmath44 for three different bias voltages and the zero gate potential .",
    "the sharp peak in @xmath61 is the result of a resonance transmission through the lumo of the c@xmath0 . at @xmath75 ,",
    "this resonance lies just above the fermi level of the leads , see figures [ dos1 ] and [ dos2 ] . as the bias voltage is applied , the peak position shifts toward higher energies .",
    "if the system is absolutely symmetric and @xmath82 , we would expect the same voltage drop at the two electrode - molecule junctions . in our system ,",
    "the atomic structures of @xmath83 facing the left and right electrodes are not the same , and this breaks the left - right symmetry .",
    "we therefore observe an asymmetric voltage drop at the two contacts .",
    "consequently , the transmission peak position shifts by about @xmath84ev when @xmath62 is increased by @xmath85v , _",
    "i.e. _ , the applied voltage drops more on one side than on the other side of the c@xmath0 .",
    "we also calculated the i - v curve for this device by use of equation ( [ current1 ] ) ; it is shown in the inset of figure [ iv ] .",
    "= 9.45 cm    = 9.45 cm    we can easily calculate the equilibrium conductance @xmath86 of the junction , @xmath87 .",
    "in the linear regime , @xmath88v , see figure [ iv ] , we can use the following formula : @xmath89 ( valid in the zero temperature limit ) . here",
    ", @xmath90 is the quantum of conductance . as the positive gate potential changes the occupancy of the lumo - derived energy levels",
    ", we can expect the strong dependence of @xmath91 for different separations of the leads .",
    "these results are presented in figures [ g1 ] and [ g2 ] .",
    "similar metallic behaviour has been reported before @xcite for al - c@xmath0-al junctions at the electrode separation of @xmath92 ( it correspondes to the minimum distance between an al atom and c atom of @xmath93 ) .",
    "note that the work function of al is @xmath94ev whereas the work function of au is @xmath95ev . at @xmath96",
    ", we have @xmath97 , @xmath98 for the al - c@xmath0-al junction @xcite and @xmath99 , @xmath100 for the au - c@xmath0-au one ( the electrode separation of 11.7 ) . in addition , for the au - c@xmath0-au device , the current in the linear ( metallic ) regime is ( roughly ) one order of value smaler than the current calculated for the al - c@xmath0-al one .    here , the interesting physics is that despite the large homo - lumo gap of a free @xmath83 ( @xmath101ev @xcite ) , we predict metallic transport characteristics for the au - c@xmath0-au devices , and they are qualitatively the same as the properties of the al - c@xmath0-al devices .",
    "we found that if the @xmath83 molecule is relatively well bonded to metallic leads , there is a strong charge transfer from the leads to the c@xmath0 cage and it partially fills the ( empty ) lumo of c@xmath0 .",
    "in other words , charge transfer from the electrodes to c@xmath0 aligns the lumo to the fermi energy of the leads . as a result",
    ", we obtain a large resonance conductance and the metallic i - v curve .",
    "we have shown that the negf - dft formalism is a powerful technique for modeling charge transport properties of molecular electronic devices .",
    "the novelty of this technique is in constructing electron charge density via nonequilibrium green s functions and the very effective screening approximation .",
    "since the entire algorithm is based on evaluating green s function , the technique is intrinsically @xmath102 @xcite : this is because atoms far away from each other do not overlap so that the hamiltonian matrix is block - diagonal .",
    "this has tremendous computational advantage which we demonstrated by calculating the nonlinear i - v curve of the au - c@xmath0-au molecular tunnel junction .",
