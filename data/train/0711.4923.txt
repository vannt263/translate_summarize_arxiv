    "ryabchikova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that there might exist no real dichotomy between roap and noap stars , and weak pulsational variability is present in all cool ap stars . with the aim to test this hypothesis and to obtain the first complete picture of the incidence of pulsations in ap stars",
    ", we used the ultra - stable spectrograph harps at eso to obtain time - resolved spectra for a sample of 10 noap and weakly oscillating ap stars . here",

    "ryabchikova et al . ( @xcite ) performed an abundance analysis of hd75445 , finding this star to be a spectroscopic twin of the well - known roap star @xmath2  equ .",

    "thus , hd75445 is a new roap star , and the first one discovered with harps .",
    "kochukhov et al . ( @xcite ) found a tentative evidence of the 11.5-min rv variation in @xmath1  crb .",
    "this period was not confirmed by hatzes & mkrtichian ( @xcite ) , who reported definite 16.2-min oscillation . using harps we obtained 93 high - precision observations of @xmath1  crb .",
    "the rv analysis of ce  ii lines reveals pulsational variability close to the previously reported 16.2-min period .",
    "moreover , our time - series shows strong amplitude modulation ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , indicating the presence of at least two frequencies . a least - squares fit yields periods @xmath5 and @xmath6 min with amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 ms@xmath4 , respectively .",
