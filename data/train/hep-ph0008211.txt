    "<S> the type ii supernova is considered as a candidate site for the production of heavy elements . since the supernova produces an intense neutrino flux , neutrino scattering processes will impact element formation . </S>",
    "<S> we examine active - sterile neutrino conversion in this environment and find that it may help to produce the requisite neutron - to - seed ratio for synthesis of the r - process elements .    the r - process of nucleosynthesis accounts for the most neutron rich of the heavy elements . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely environment for this type of synthesis is the late time ( @xmath0 post - core bounce ) supernova environment . </S>",
    "<S> many studies have explored this neutrino driven wind  as a candidate environment and found it to be potentially viable @xcite . however , to date , no model correctly reproduces the observed abundance pattern .    in the neutrino driven wind , material in the form of free nucleons </S>",
    "<S> is lifted  off of the surface of the neutron star by energy deposited by neutrino interactions . </S>",
    "<S> analytic and semianalytic parameterizations of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic conditions in the wind can be obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> models of this type may be used to explore the range of conditions within the context of the wind which will produce the solar system distribution of r - process elements </S>",
    "<S> . the key determinant of whether a given scenario will produce the r - process is the neutron to seed nucleus ratio at the onset of the neutron capture phase . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio must be quite high ( @xmath1 ) in order to produce the very neutron - rich r - process elements . </S>",
    "<S> the factors which determine the neutron - to - seed ratio are the entropy of the material , the hydrodynamic outflow timescale and the electron fraction , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the neutron - to - proton ratio . </S>",
    "<S> a study of many possible model parameters shows that one must decrease the electron fraction , and/or increase the entropy and/or decrease the hydrodynamic outflow timescale , relative to the conditions found in typical wind models , in order to produce the neutron - to - seed ratio necessary for the r - process @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> including the effects of neutrino interactions in general tends to make the requisite conditions for r - process element production more extreme @xcite . in particular , neutrino capture on free nucleons during alpha particle formation increases the electron fraction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is the `` alpha effect '' . </S>",
    "<S> other neutrino process are discussed in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    there are three possible solutions to this problem . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that the supernova is the site of r - process synthesis , but it does not occur in the neutrino driven wind as it is currently modeled . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that the r - process elements are made at some other site such as neutron star - neutron star mergers . </S>",
    "<S> however , timescale arguments combined with isotopic abundance measurements and observations of old halo star metallicity show that this site is unlikely to account for the entire r - process distribution @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the third solution is the one that is investigated here : active - sterile ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) neutrino transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 in our study is defined as a particle which mixes with the @xmath7 ( and possibly also with @xmath8 , and/or @xmath9 ) but does not contribute to the width of the z boson .    </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect @xmath10-@xmath10 forward scattering contributions to the weak potentials , then the equation which governs the evolution of the neutrinos as they pass though the material in the wind can be written as :    @xmath11 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\varphi_e(r ) & ( \\delta m^2 / 4 e)\\sin{2\\theta_v }   \\\\ \\\\ ( \\delta m^2 / 4 e)\\sin{2\\theta_v } & -\\varphi_e(r ) \\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\psi_e(r ) \\\\ \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\psi_s(r )    \\end{array}\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : msw}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 e - \\delta m^2    \\cos{2\\theta_v } \\right ) \\label{eq : potne}\\ ] ] the upper sign is relevant for neutrino transformations ; the lower one is for antineutrinos . in these equations @xmath13 is the vacuum mass - squared splitting , @xmath14 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath15 is the fermi constant , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the total proper number densities of electrons , positrons , and neutrons respectively in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> resonances can occur when the on - diagonal terms in the wave equation are zero . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity in the brackets in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : potne ] is proportional to @xmath19 . since the electron fraction can take on values between zero and one , the bracketed quantity in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : potne ] can be either positive or negative . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for a given choice of @xmath20 , resonances may occur for neutrinos or antineutrinos depending on the value of the electron fraction .    in order to determine the survival probabilities of the neutrinos and antineutrinos , we must know the electron fraction . in the neutrino driven wind , </S>",
    "<S> neutrino and antineutrino capture are the most important reactions in determining the electron fraction . </S>",
    "<S> however , near the surface of the protoneutron star there is also a contribution from electrons and positrons : @xmath21 therefore , the problem involves a feedback mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino capture rates determine the electron fraction and the electron fraction determines the potential which is used in the neutrino transformation equations . </S>",
    "<S> these equations then determine survival probabilities of the neutrinos , and therefore their capture rates .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that we can not assume weak equilibrium , ( very fast capture rates compared with outflow rate ) or weak freeze - out ( very slow rates compared with the outflow rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rates must be tracked numerically . </S>",
    "<S> a previous study took the limit of weak equilibrium and found different behavior @xcite than presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform calculations by tracking a mass element in the neutrino driven wind . </S>",
    "<S> we use the results of analytic models @xcite , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the outflow timescale . </S>",
    "<S> close to the surface , before the wind begins to operate we use the density profile of wilson and mayle @xcite . at each time step </S>",
    "<S> we calculate all thermodynamic quantities , calculate the weak rates and evolve the neutrino transformation equations forward . </S>",
    "<S> we assume , since the outflow timescale is short , @xmath25 , that each mass element will have the same evolution as the previous one . </S>",
    "<S> since we use a nuclear statistical equilibrium calculation , we cut our calculations off at the time when heavy nuclei begin to form . </S>",
    "<S> more detail is contained in @xcite .    a calculation for one mass element </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : efraction1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the upper curve shows the evolution for the case of no neutrino oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the wind parameters were @xmath26 , @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line shows the actual electron fraction , while the dotted line shows what the electron fraction would be if weak equilibrium obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the initial rise is due to pauli unblocking of the electrons at the surface of the proto - neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the lower curve shows the evolution of the electron fraction for mixing parameters of @xmath28 , @xmath29 . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> there is a rapid drop in the electron fraction when the neutrinos begin to transform . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are three neutrino transformations . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the electron neutrinos transform to steriles . </S>",
    "<S> later antineutrinos transform , and finally , when the density falls far enough the antineutrinos transform back . </S>",
    "<S> the first transformation of the antineutrinos is seen in the small bump in the equilibrium electron fraction . </S>",
    "<S> a small `` alpha effect '' can be see as the slight rise in both solid lines at large distance .    </S>",
    "<S> the active - sterile transformation scenario successfully reproduces a low electron fraction which is beneficial to the r - process . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider a range of @xmath20 , @xmath30 parameters . a contour plot of the electron fraction is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : efraction2 ] . inside the dashed contour shows the region where conditions are neutron - rich enough to be favorable for r - process nucleosynthesis . in the bottom </S>",
    "<S> left corner of the plot , the solution is approaching the case without neutrino transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> although not shown here , we have studied a range of timescales for the neutrino driven wind models , and seen that the qualitative features of this effect are reproduced @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used several approximations in our calculations , which we are continuing to study . </S>",
    "<S> these include the importance of the neutrino - neutrino scattering background in the oscillation equations , the importance of nonradial paths and feedback in the dense region near the proto - neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the region where the latter two are important is the shaded region in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : efraction2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these problems are being studied in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions : * meteoritic and observational evidence points to supernovae as the source of the r - process elements , although a self - consistent model of the neutrino driven wind which will produce the r - process elements is still elusive . in the next few years </S>",
    "<S> significant advances are expected in supernova modeling . </S>",
    "<S> if and when potential hydrodynamic solutions are exhausted and the caveats above have been explored , then the r - process may provide a signature for new neutrino physics . </S>"
