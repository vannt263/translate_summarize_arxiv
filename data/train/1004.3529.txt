    "today , 150 years after the close of its great eruption , @xmath0 car has not yet returned to thermal and rotational equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this fact is important because the `` sn impostor '' phenomenon and its aftermath constitute a major gap in the theory of massive stars , and @xmath0 car is the only example that can be studied in detail ; see reviews by many authors in @xcite .",
    "its recovery has been _ unsteady _ , with unexplained photometric and spectral changes in the 1890s and 1940s @xcite .",
    "this object may have entered a phase of accelerated development 12 - 15 years ago . from 1953 to the mid-1990 s ,",
    "ground - based ` v ' photometry of star plus ejecta brightened at a rate of 0.024 mag / yr , with brief deviations smaller than @xmath10.3 mag ( fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "in the past decade , however , it has risen 0.6 mag above that earlier trend line ( fig .  3 in ) .",
    "the central star shows a more dramatic increase , a factor of more than 3 in uv - to - visual _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) ) _ data since 1998 @xcite .",
    "a decrease in the amount of circumstellar dust may be responsible , but that requires some change in the wind and/or radiation field .",
    "meanwhile the periodic `` spectroscopic events '' of 1998.0 , 2003.5 , and 2009.0 , defined in  2 below , differed in major respects @xcite .",
    "very likely the mass - loss rate has been decreasing at an inconstant pace , while rotational spin - up may play a role @xcite .",
    "all those discussions , however , seemed to face an embarrassing observational contradiction . from the first _",
    "hst _ spectroscopy in 1991 until the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) failed in 2004 , _",
    "@xmath0 car s spectrum showed no major change _ except during the temporary spectroscopic events .",
    "one might have expected some sort of spectral evolution to accompany the rapid brightening after 1998 .    in this letter",
    "we report a novel development : observations in 20072010 with gemini / gmos and _ hst_/stis reveal major spectral changes .",
    "they are not subtle ; evidently the wind has been altered , at least temporarily and perhaps for the indefinite future .",
    "for long - term trends we need quantitative spectra of @xmath0 car with consistent instrument characteristics , sampled over at least several years . unfortunately no suitable data set exists prior to the _ hst _ observations , which began with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) in the 1990 s @xcite , and continued with stis after 1997 .",
    "here we use _ hst _ spectroscopy of the central star with spatial resolution better than 0.3 , almost free of contamination by nearby ejecta .",
    "gemini / gmos spectra of the central 1 in 20072010 provide valuable independent information .",
    "eta car has a complex 5.54-year spectroscopic cycle , most likely regulated by a companion star in an eccentric orbit , as discussed by many authors in @xcite .",
    "( the periodicity was discovered in stages by , @xcite , and @xcite . )",
    "high - excitation emission lines temporarily vanish during periodic `` spectroscopic events , '' e.g. , around 1998.0 , 2003.5 , and 2009.0 , perhaps near periastron .",
    "the spectrum change described in this paper is more conspicuous than any of those events , and there is no strong reason to assume that it is related to the 5.54-year cycle .",
    "but such a linkage might exist , and in any case the cycle may influence any data comparison .",
    "therefore we compare spectra at corresponding phases of successive cycles . here",
    "`` phase '' is defined by @xmath2 days and @xmath3 mjd 50814.0 = j1998.00 , consistent with the @xmath0  car  hst treasury program archive .",
    "phases 0.00 , 1.00 , and 2.00 mark the 1998.0 , 2003.5 , and 2009.0 spectroscopic events .    after a five - year hiatus",
    ", stis obtained new spectra of @xmath0 car beginning in mid-2009 .",
    "our observations in august 2009 and march 2010 occurred at phases 2.10 and 2.20 , and fortunately some stis data had been obtained approximately one and two cycles earlier , at phases 1.12 in 2004 and 0.21 in 1999 .",
    "it is also prudent to examine data sets taken one cycle apart during 19982004 .",
    "therefore we compare spectra of the star at phases 0.04 vs.  1.03 , 1.12 vs.  2.10 , and 0.21 vs.  2.20 .",
    "the 0.04/1.03 data were close to spectroscopic events but not within them ; in most proposed orbit models they represent longitudes 100@xmath4140@xmath4 past periastron , with star - star separations 25 times larger than at periastron .",
    "the 0.21/2.20 phases were well outside the events @xcite .",
    "improved stis data reduction techniques were developed for the @xmath0 car hst treasury program @xcite .",
    "however , in early 2010 the software has not yet been adapted to some format changes necessary for the new data . on the other hand the current stsci data pipeline",
    "could not easily be applied to some of the 19982004 data .",
    "therefore we used treasury program methods for the 19982004 stis data and the stsci pipeline for the 20092010 data .",
    "we extracted one - dimensional spectra of the star with a sampling width of 0.25 .",
    "this was broader than we would have chosen if the treasury program techniques had been employed throughout , but it is narrow enough to exclude most of the ejecta .    in principle the use of two reduction procedures might cause illusory spectrum differences , but they would be no worse than a few percent",
    ". the 0.25 extraction width amounts to 5 ccd rows , broad enough for good agreement in the interpolation and integration steps .",
    "these statements are confirmed by random checks of a few 19982004 spectra reduced by both methods .",
    "we also examined semi - raw data files ",
    "flat - fielded and with cosmic ray hits removed , but otherwise unprocessed  and they show the same large effects as the reduced spectra (  3 below ) .",
    "our results do not depend on absolute flux calibrations or precise spatial sampling .",
    "we verified and extended our findings with gemini / gmos observations in 20072010 , reduced with the gemini iraf package .",
    "they sampled wavelengths 36007200  with slit width 0.5 , see @xcite .",
    "during 19912004 , hst / fos and hst / stis showed no definite secular change in @xmath0 car s stellar wind spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath5 equivalent width , for instance , varied only @xmath110% ( r.m.s . ) outside spectroscopic events @xcite .",
    "figure 1a illustrates the similarity of broad wind features in two successive cycles before 2004 .",
    "the qualitative ground - based record from 1900 to 1990 shows no discernible instance of a change like that reported below ; see many refs .  in @xcite .",
    "the 20092010 stis data , however , reveal _ the weakest broad - line spectrum ever seen in modern observations of this object , _ relative to the underlying continuum .",
    "we notice several effects :    1 .",
    "low - excitation emission created in the stellar wind became far less prominent .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows blends of , [ ] , and near 4600  .",
    "phases 0.04 and 1.03 ( 1998 and 2003 ) were mutually consistent , but @xmath6 decreased by factors of 24 between phases 1.12 and 2.10 and likewise between 0.21 and 2.20 ( table 1 ) .",
    "most of the broad lines originate in the primary star s wind , see many papers and refs .  in @xcite .",
    "the profile of h@xmath7 , the strongest emission line in the violet - to - red spectrum , is altered and weakened in the recent stis data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "h@xmath7 had a low flat - topped profile during the 2003.5 event and then partially recovered @xcite ; but now it is even weaker ( table 1 ) .",
    "the narrow h@xmath7 absorption near @xmath8 km s@xmath9 indicates unusual nebular physics far outside the wind .",
    "always present in 19982004 , this feature had weakened by 2007 but reappeared during the 2009.0 event . by march 2010",
    "it had practically vanished .",
    "3 .   high - excitation emission did not weaken along with the features noted above , but the p cyg _ absorption _ features of helium greatly strengthened after the 2009 event , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this requires caution because varies intricately during each cycle .",
    "note , however , that only a few occasions in 19982004 showed absorption as deep as that seen at phase 2.20 in march 2010 ; and phase 0.21 showed practically none .",
    "table 1 lists the equivalent widths of emission and absorption features mentioned above .",
    "similar changes occurred throughout the violet - to - red wind spectrum .",
    "uv emission lines around 2600  weakened relative to the continuum , while the overall brightness in that wavelength region increased by 2030% between august 2009 and march 2010 .",
    "stis observations by other researchers in june 2009 , covering a smaller set of wavelengths , are consistent with our results .",
    "gemini / gmos observations in 20072010 confirm the reality of these spectrum changes , figure 1d . in 2010",
    "the gmos data show stronger emission lines than stis does ( fig .",
    "1d vs.  1c ) , merely because the 1 ground - based spatial resolution allows significant contributions by ejecta far outside the stellar wind .",
    "nevertheless , equivalent widths of low - excitation emission blends in the gmos data decreased by factors of about 2 between june 2007 and march 2010 .",
    "most of our gmos data at intermediate times were of lower quality , but they strongly suggest that the spectral change was progressive rather than abrupt .",
    "we emphasize that the _ stellar wind _ emission lines have weakened relative to the continuum ; outlying ejecta will require a separate investigation .",
    "the simplest explanation is a decrease in @xmath0 car s primary wind density , which seems natural for the long - term recovery as well as other recent data @xcite .",
    "the surprise is in the rapidity of this development .",
    "long ago it was expected that after the year 2050 this object will appear much as it did to halley and lacaille three centuries ago , a hot fourth - magnitude star with a transparent rather than opaque wind @xcite .",
    "but now the schedule appears to be accelerated ; if the recent trend continues ( which we can not predict ) , the star will approach that goal in only a decade . even if the spectrum regresses to its earlier state ,",
    "these developments are crucial because the observational record shows no precedent for them .",
    "the effects reported in  3 do not match the standard traits of luminous blue variables @xcite .",
    "the energy carried by @xmath0 car s wind surpasses a bright classical lbv by a factor of 100 or more , and its emission lines are far stronger .",
    "when an lbv experiences a major eruption its wind becomes opaque , cools below 9000 k , and develops a rich absorption - line spectrum within a few months .",
    "visual wavelengths brighten but the uv correspondingly fades .",
    "something like that did happen to @xmath0 car around 1890 ; but its recent record , by contrast , shows no perceptible decrease in the uv / visual flux ratio .",
    "`` lbv '' is not a very satisfactory label for this object , since much of its 18302010 behavior does not fit that category well . if the recent change proves to be an increase rather than a decrease of the wind ",
    "i.e. , contrary to the hypothesis that we favor ",
    "then @xmath0 car may soon mimic a third - magnitude f - type supergiant !",
    "other alternatives to the decreasing - wind interpretation include , e.g. , a change in the latitude - dependence of the wind @xcite , or the unusual models for @xmath0 car favored by @xcite .",
    "many complications exist .",
    "for instance , a lessened wind density should cause the photosphere ( located in the opaque wind ) to shrink and become hotter , eventually leading to a _ decrease _ in visual - wavelength flux .",
    "indeed this may have occurred in 2006 , but circumstellar dust and other factors probably dominate .    numerous observables figure in the problem .",
    "for example , in  3 we mentioned that lines have behaved differently from the lower - excitation features .",
    "helium emission and absorption processes in @xmath0 car s wind depend on the companion star and have other special characteristics , see  6 of @xcite . also relevant are the 210 kev x - rays formed in the wind - wind collision zone .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the earlier - than - expected recovery of x - rays after the 2009.0 spectroscopic event may signal a decrease in the wind density .",
    "independent of that problem , in early 2010 the 210 kev flux has been about 20% below the level seen in two previous 5.5-yr cycles @xcite .",
    "this decrease is much less extreme than the spectroscopic changes described in  3 above ; perhaps these effects depend on latitude differences between our direct view of the wind and conditions near the wind - wind shocks @xcite .",
    "realistic wind models will need to be non - spherical and even non - axisymmetric .",
    "eta car s behavior may provide spectroscopic opportunities not foreseen until recently .",
    "for instance , if the wind becomes semi - transparent , then the temperature and radius of the primary star may become observable for the first time .",
    "moderate - sized instruments are valuable because hst and large telescopes will provide , at best , only sparse temporal sampling .",
    "fortunately , ground - based observations now show @xmath0 car  the star itself  more clearly than they did ten years ago , because the diffuse ejecta have not brightened as fast as the star .",
    "an obvious need is for _ instrumentally homogeneous _ series of spectra .",
    "since the wind has characteristic size scales of several au and velocities of several hundred km s@xmath9 , changes may occur on timescales as short as a week .",
