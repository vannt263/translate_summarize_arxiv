    "in this course , and in the two related lectures by ebert and brener on their work in @xcite and @xcite , some basic features of the dynamics of growing interfaces in systems which spontaneously form nonequilibrium patterns will be discussed .",
    "the analysis of such growth patterns has been an active field of research in the last decade .",
    "moreover , the field is quite diverse , with examples coming from various ( sub)disciplines within physics , materials science , and even biology  combustion , convection , crystal growth , chemical waves in excitable media and the formation of turing patterns , dielectric breakdown , fracture , morphogenesis , etc . we therefore can not hope to review the whole field , but instead will content ourselves with addressing three rather basic topics which we consider to be of rather broad interest , in that they appear ( in disguise ) in many areas of physics and in some of the related fields .",
    "these three themes are explained below .",
    "our _ first theme _ concerns the _ generality of interfacial growth problems in which the normal growth velocity @xmath0 is proportional to the gradient @xmath1 of a bulk field @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and the associated long wavelength instability of such interfaces . _",
    "as we shall see , one important class of interfacial growth problems with these properties is diffusion limited growth : either the interface grows through the accretion of material via diffusion through one of the adjacent bulk phases , or the growth of the interface is limited by the speed through which , e.g. , heat can be transported away from the interface through diffusion . since the diffusion current near the interface is proportional to the gradient of the appropriate field in the bulk ( a concentration field , the temperature , etc . ) , @xmath3 in such growth problems .",
    "but these are not the only possibilities of how one can have an interface velocity proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "as we will discuss , in viscous fingering an air bubble displaces fluid between two closely spaced plates ; as the fluid velocity between the plates is proportional to the gradient of a pressure field @xmath4 , the fact that the air displaces all the fluid means that again at the interface @xmath5 .",
    "likewise , for an ionization front the interface velocity is determined mostly by the drift velocity of electrons in the electric field @xmath6 , where now @xmath7 is the electrical potential , and so again @xmath8 .",
    "as we shall see , all such interfacial growth problems where the bulk field itself obeys a laplace of diffusion equation , exhibit a long wavelength instability , the so - called mullins - sekerka instability @xcite .",
    "this instability lies at the origin of the formation of many nontrivial growth patterns , and brener and ebert discussed examples of these at the school .",
    "although this theme is not at all new , it is nevertheless useful to discuss it as an introduction and to stress the generality  the same mullins - sekerka instability plays a role in fractal growth processes like diffusion limited aggregation @xcite .",
    "the above issues are the subject of the first lecture and section [ theme1 ] .    in physics",
    ", it is quite common  and often done intuitively without even stating this explicitly  to switch back and forth between a formulation in terms of a mathematically sharp interface ( an infinitely thin surface or line at wich the physical fields or their derivatives can show discontinuities ) and a formulation in terms of a continuous order parameter field which exhibits a smooth but relatively thin transition zone or domain wall .",
    "e.g. , we think of the interface between a solid and its melt as a microscopically thin interface , whose width is of the order of a few atomic dimensions . accordingly , the formulation of the equations that govern the formation of growth patterns of a solid which grows into an undercooled melt on much larger scales @xmath9 have traditionally been formulated in terms of a sharp interface or boundary .",
    "the equations , which will be discussed below , are then the diffusion equation for the temperature in the bulk of the liquid and the solid , together with boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "these interfacial boundary conditions are a kinematic equation for the growth velocity of the interface in terms of the local interface temperature , and a conservation equation for the heat .",
    "the latter expresses that the latent heat released at the interface upon growth of the solid has to be transported away through diffusion into the liquid and the solid . in other words , in an interfacial formulation , the appropriate equations for the bulk fields are introduced , but the way in which the order parameter changes from one state to the other in the interfacial region , is not taken into account explicitly : the physics at the interface is lumped into appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "such an interface formulation of the equations often expresses the physics quite well and most efficiently , and is often the most convenient one for the analytical calculations which we will present later . for numerical calculations , however , the existence of a sharp boundary or interface is a nuisance , as they force one to introduce highly non - trivial interface tracking methods .",
    "partly to avoid this complication , several workers have introduced in the last few years different models , often referred to as phase - field models @xcite , in which the transition from one phase or state to another one is described by introducing a continuum equation for the appropriate order parameter . instead of a sharp interface ,",
    "one then has a smooth but thin transition zone of width @xmath10 , where the order parameter changes from one ( meta)stable state to another one .",
    "numerically , such smooth interface models are much easier to handle , since one can in principle apply standard numerical integration routines . at the same time , one usually wants to study pattern formation on a scale @xmath11 , so that many gridpoints are needed .",
    "hence computer power becomes the limiting factor .",
    "nevertheless , numerical similations of dendrites using such phase - field models nowadays appear to present the best way to test analytical predictions and to compare with experimental data @xcite . ] .    while we mentioned above an example where one has ( sometimes in a somewhat artifial way ) introduced continuum field equations to analyze a sharp interface problem , insight into the dynamics of problems with a moving smooth but thin transition zone is often more easily gained by going in the opposite direction , i.e. , by viewing this zone as a mathematically sharp interface or shock front .",
    "an example of this is found in combustion @xcite . in premixed flames , the reaction zone is usually quite small , and one speaks of flame sheets .",
    "already long ago , landau ( and independently darrieus ) considered the stability of planar flame fronts by viewing them as a sharp interface @xcite . in the last 20 years",
    ", much progress has been made in the field of combustion by building on this idea of using an effective interface description of thin flame sheets .",
    "likewise , much of the progress on understanding chemical waves , spirals and other patterns in reaction diffusion systems rests on the possibility to exploit similar ideas @xcite .",
    "other examples from condensed matter physics : if the magnetic anisotropy is not too large , domain walls in solids can have an appreciable width , but for many studies of magnetic domains of size much larger than this width , we normally prefer to think of the walls as being infinitely thin @xcite .",
    "similar considerations hold for domains in liquid crystals @xcite . in studies of coarsening ( the gradual increase in the typical length scale after a quench of a binary fluid or alloy into the so - called spinodal regime where demixing occurs ) , both smooth and sharp",
    "interface formulations are being used @xcite .    at a summer school on statistical physics",
    ", it seems appropriate to note in passing that some of the model equations which include the order parameter are very similar to those studied in particular in the field of dynamic critical phenomena , such as model _ a , b , _ .. etc . in the classification of hohenberg and halperin @xcite . here , however , we are not interested in the universal scaling properties of an essentially homogeneous system near the critical point of a second order phase transition , but in many cases in the nonlinear nonequilibrium dynamics of interfaces between a metastable and a stable state .",
    "this corresponds to the situation near a first order transition in fig .",
    "4(_b _ ) below . here",
    "the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 both correspond to minima of the free energy density @xmath14 . in section 2.1 fronts between these two ( meta)stable states are discussed . ] . when we consider in section [ theme3 ] fronts which propagate into an unstable state ,",
    "this can be viewed as the interfacial analogue of the behavior when we quench a system through a second order phase transition , especially within a mean - field picture and one minimum at some @xmath15 .",
    "fronts propagating into an unstable state precisely correspond to fronts between these two states .",
    "compare fig .",
    "9(_b _ ) , where @xmath16 . ] , where fluctuations are not important .",
    "finally , we also stress that while thermal fluctuations are essential to second order phase transition , they can often be neglected in pattern forming systems , since the typical length and energy scales of interest in pattern forming systems are normally very large ( see section vi.d of @xcite for further discussion of this point ) .    a word about nomenclature .",
    "for many physicists , front , domain wall and reaction zone are words that have the connotation of describing smooth transition zones of finite thickness , while the word interface is being used for a surface whose thickness is so small that it can be treated as a mathematically sharp boundary of zero thickness .",
    "the approximation in which the interface thickness is taken to zero is sometimes refered to as a _ moving boundary approximation_. since neither this concept nor the meaning of the word `` interface '' is universally accepted , we will sometimes use _ effective interface description _ or _",
    "effective interface approximation _ as an alternative to `` moving boundary approximation '' to denote a description of a front or transition zone by a sharp interface with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "of course , switching back and forth between a sharp interface formulation or one with a smooth continuous order parameter field is only possible if the latter reduces to the first in the limit in which the interface thickness @xmath17 ( the interface width is illustrated in fig .  8 below ) .",
    "indeed , it is possible to derive an effective interface description systematically by performing an expansion of the equations in powers of @xmath10 ( technically , this is done using singular perturbation theory or matched asymptotic expansions @xcite ) . in such an analysis ,",
    "the wall or front is treated as a sharp interface when viewed on the `` outer '' pattern forming length scale @xmath11 , and the dynamics of the front or wall on the `` inner '' scale @xmath10 emerges in the form of one or more boundary conditions for this interface .",
    "e.g. , one boundary condition can be a simple expression for the normal velocity of the interface in terms of the local values of the slowly varying outer fields , like the temperature .",
    "this brings us to the _ second theme _ and lecture of this course : _ for the adiabatic decoupling of slow and fast variables underlying an effective interface description , an exponential relaxation of the front structure and velocity is necessary_. the point is that an interfacial description  mapping a smooth continuum model onto one with a sharp interface for the analysis of patterns on a length scale @xmath11  is only possible if we can make an _ adiabatic decoupling_. in intuitive terms , this means that if we `` freeze '' the slowly varying outer fields ( temperature , pressure , etc . ) at their instantaneous values and perturb the front profile on the scale @xmath10 by some amount , then the front profile and speed should relax as @xmath18 to some asymptotic shape and value which are given in terms of the `` frozen '' outer field .",
    "if , moreover , the inner front relaxation time @xmath19 vanishes as @xmath17 ( e.g. , in the model we will discuss @xmath20 ) , then indeed in the limit @xmath21 the relaxation of the order parameter dynamics within the front region decouples completely from the slow time and length scale variation of the outer fields , as in the limit @xmath17 both the length and the time scale become more and more separated .",
    "the adiabatic decoupling then implies that for @xmath22 the front follows essentially instantaneously the slow variation of the outer fields in the region near the front .",
    "accordingly , in the interfacial limit @xmath17 the front dynamics on the inner scale @xmath10 then translates into boundary conditions that are _ local in time and space _ at the interface . as we shall illustrate , for fronts between two ( meta)stable states , the separation of both length and time scale as @xmath17 is normally the case , and this justifies an interfacial description .",
    "of course , stated this way , the above point may strike you as trivial , as it is a common feature of problems in which fast variables can be eliminated @xcite .",
    "however , it is an observation that we have hardly ever seen stressed or even discussed at all in the literature , and its importance is illustrated by our _ third theme : fronts propagating into an unstable state may show a separation of spatial scales in the limit @xmath17 , but need not show a separation of time scales in this limit .",
    "_ our reason for the last statement is that , as we will discuss , a wide class of fronts which propagate into an unstable state ( the interfacial analogue of the situation near a second order phase transition ) exhibits slow power law relaxation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this certainly calls the possibility of an effective interface formulation with boundary conditions which are local in space _ and _ time into question , but the consequences of this power law relaxation still remain to be fully explored .",
    "the connection between the issue of the front relaxation and the issue of the separation of time scales necessary for an effective interface description is still a subject of ongoing research of ebert and myself .",
    "we will in these lecture notes only give an introduction to the background of this issue and to the ideas underlying the usual approaches , leaving the real analysis and a full discussion of this problem to our future publications @xcite .    that our third theme is not a formal esotheric issue , is illustrated by the fact that it grew out of our attempt to develop an interfacial description for streamers",
    "as has been discussed by ebert in her seminar , streamers are examples of a nonequilibrium pattern forming phenomenon .",
    "they consist of a very sharp fronts ( @xmath24 ) which shows patterns with a size @xmath9 of order 1 mm @xcite",
    ". however , a streamer front turns out to be an example of a front propagating into an unstable state @xcite , and we have found through bitter experience that the standard methods to arrive at an interfacial approximation break down , and that the slow power law relaxation lies at the heart of this . apart from this , the power law relaxation is of interest in its own right , especially at a summer school on fundamental problems in statistical mechanics , as its universality is reminiscent of the universal behavior near a second order critical point in the theory of phase transitions  the common origin of both is in fact the universality of the flow near the asymptotic fixed point .",
    "when we undercool a pure liquid below the melting temperature , the liquid will not solidify immediately .",
    "this is because below the melting temperature the liquid is only metastable .",
    "moreover , the solid - liquid transition is usually strongly first order , so that the nucleation rate for the solid phase to form through nucleation at small to moderate undercoolings is low . if , however , we bring a solid nucleus into the melt , the solid will start to grow immediately at its interfaces .",
    "initially the shape of the solid germ remains rather smooth ( we assume the interface to be rough , not faceted @xcite ) , but once it has grown sufficiently large , it does not stay rounded ( like an ice cube melting in a soft - drink ) , but instead branch - type structures grow out .",
    "an example of such a so - called dendrite is shown in fig .",
    "[ dendretc]_(a)_. the basic instability underlying the formation of these dendrites is the mullins - sekerka instability discussed below , and which in this case is associated with the build - up near the interface of a diffusion boundary layer in the temperature .",
    "this in turn is due to the fact that while the solid grows , latent heat is released at the interface . in fact , the amount of heat released is normally so large that most of the heat has to diffuse away , in order to prevent the local temperature to come above the melting temperature @xmath25 . e.g. , for water the latent heat released when a certain volume solidifies is enough to heat up that same volume by about 80 @xmath26c .",
    "so , since the undercooling is normally just a few degrees , most of the latent heat has to diffuse away in order for the temperature not to exceed @xmath25 .",
    "= 5.5 cm    the basic equations that model this physics are the diffusion equation for the temperature in the liquid and the solid , @xmath27 together with the boundary conditions at the interface @xmath28 ~ , \\\\",
    "v_n & = &   { { 1}\\over{\\beta } } [ t_m(1-(\\sigma / l ) \\kappa ) - t^{\\rm    int}]~. \\label{dendrbc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq . ( [ dendrdiff ] ) is just the normal heat diffusion equation for the temperature ; it holds both in the liquid ( @xmath29 ) and in the solid ( @xmath30 ) . at the interface ,",
    "the temperature is continuous , so there @xmath31 . in ( [ dendrdiff ] )",
    ", we have for simplicity taken the diffusion coefficient @xmath32 in both phases equal . the first boundary condition ( [ dendrbc1 ] )",
    "expresses the heat conservation at the interface : @xmath0 is the normal growth velocity of the interface , so @xmath33 is the amount of heat released at the surface per unit time ( @xmath34 is the latent heat per unit volume ) . if we consider an infinitesimal `` pillbox '' at the interface , the heat produced has to be equal to the net amount of heat which is being transported out of the flat sides through heat diffusion .",
    "the heat current is in general @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the specific heat per unit volume ( the combination @xmath37 is the so - called heat conductivity ) , and we denote the components normal to the interface by @xmath38 and @xmath39 . after dividing by @xmath36 ,",
    "we therefore recognize in the right hand side of ( [ dendrbc1 ] ) the net heat flow away from the interface .",
    "note that this equation is completely fixed by a conservation law at the interface , in this case conservation of heat , and that it can be written down by inspection .",
    "the only input is the assumption that the interface is very thin .",
    "moreover , it shows the structure we mentioned in the beginning , namely that the normal growth velocity is proportional to the gradient of a bulk quantity  the larger the difference in the gradients in the solid and the liquids is , the faster the growth can be .",
    "finally , the second boundary condition at the liquid - solid interface ( [ dendrbc2 ] ) is essentially the local kinetic equation which expresses the microscopic physics at the interface : we assume the interface to be rough , so that the interface can be smoothly curved @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 $ ] is then the melting temperature of such a curved interface , where @xmath41 is the surface tension . here",
    "the curvature @xmath42 is taken positive when the solid bulges out into the liquid ; the suppression of @xmath25 in such a case can intuitively be thought of as being due to the fact that there are more broken `` crystalline '' bonds if the solid is curved out into the liquid , but the relation follows quite generally from thermodynamic considerations @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath43 is a small microscopic length , say of the order of tens of ngstroms .",
    "the necessity of introducing the suppression of the local interface melting temperature will emerge later , when we will see that if we do nt do so , there would be a strong short wavelength ( `` ultraviolet '' ) instability at the interface .",
    "now that we understand the meaning of @xmath44 as a local melting term of a curved interface , we see that eq .",
    "( [ dendrbc2 ] ) just expresses the linear growth law for rough interfaces @xcite ; @xmath45 in this expression has the meaning of a mobility .",
    "if we take the limit of infinite mobility ( @xmath46 ) , the interface grows so easily that we can approximate ( [ dendrbc2 ] ) by @xmath47~,\\ ] ] which is sometimes refered to as the local equilibrium approximation .",
    "we stress that the boundary condition ( [ dendrbc2 ] ) is _ local in space and time _ , i.e. , the growth velocity @xmath0 responds _ instantaneously _ to the local temperature and curvature .",
    "there are of course sound physical reasons why this is a good approximation : the typical solid - liquid interfaces we are interested in are just a few atomic dimensions wide , and respond on the time - scale of a few atomic collision times ( of order picoseconds ) to changes in temperature @xcite , while eqs .",
    "( [ dendrdiff])-([dendrbc2 ] ) are used to analyze pattern formation on length scales of order microns or more and with growth velocities of the order of a @xmath48 m/s , say .",
    "hence , an interface grows over a distance comparable to its width in a time of the order of @xmath49 seconds , and the time scale for the evolution of the patterns is typically even slower .",
    "this wide separation of length and time scales justifies the assumptions underlying the interfacial boundary conditions .",
    "( [ dendrdiff])-([dendrbc2 ] ) , together with appropriate boundary conditions for the temperature far away from the interface , constitute the basic equations that describe the growth of a dendrite into a pure melt .",
    "they may look innocuous , as they appear to be linear equations , but they are not !",
    "the reason is that they involve the unknown position and shape of the interface through the boundary conditions , and that the dynamics of the interface depends in turn on the diffusion fields : the location of the interface has to be found self - consistently in the course of solving these equations !",
    "this is why such a so - called _ moving boundary problem _ is so highly nonlinear and complicated .    these equations ( with crystalline anisotropy included in the capillary term @xmath43 )",
    "were actually the starting point of brener s talk at the school , and the work he discussed @xcite showed how challenging the nonlinear analysis necessary to obtain a phase diagram of growth patterns can be .",
    "such work builds on many advances made in the last decade on understanding the growth velocity and shape of dendrites , and for a discussion of these we refer to the literature @xcite .      in viscous",
    "fingering , or saffman - taylor fingering , one considers a fluid ( typically an oil ) confined between two long parallel closely spaced plates . in fig .",
    "1(_b _ ) one looks from the top at such a cell  the plates , separated by a small distance @xmath50 , are thus in the plane of the paper .",
    "the two black sides in this photo constitute the lateral side walls ; the oil between the plates can not penetrate into these .",
    "the distance between these side walls is 10 _ cm _ , hence the lateral width of the cell is much smaller than the spacing @xmath51 of the plates .",
    "the thin line is the air - fluid interface and the region inside the finger - like shape is air , while the oil is outside .",
    "the air is blown into the area between the plates from the upper part of the figure .",
    "if the air - fluid interface initially stretches all the way across the cell from left to right , one quickly finds that when the air is blown in , this interface is unstable , and that after a while a single finger - shaped pattern like the one shown in fig .",
    "1(_b _ ) penetrates into the fluid . understanding the shape and width of this finger has been a major theme in interfacial pattern formation @xcite . in simple fluids",
    "it is so well understood that the analysis of the finger shapes when surfactants or polymers are added to the displaced fluid has become a way to learn something about the resulting properties of the fluid and the air - fluid interface @xcite .",
    "we will content ourselves here with giving an introduction of the basic equations , aimed at bringing out the same gradient - driven structure of the interface equations .    in viscous fingering experiments ,",
    "the spacing @xmath51 between plates is much smaller than the width of the cell ( the distance between the two dark sides in fig .",
    "1(_b _ ) . as a result ,",
    "the average fluid flow field varies in the plane of the cell only slowly over distances of the order of the lateral dimensions of the cell .",
    "locally , therefore , the flow in the small direction normal to the planes is almost like that of homogeneous planar poisseuille flow , for which we know that the average fluid velocity is @xmath52 times the gradient of the pressure @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath53 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "hence , if we now introduce @xmath54 as the height - averaged flow field between the plates of the cell , which we take to lie in the @xmath55-plane , we have @xmath56 . taking the fluid to be incompressible , @xmath57",
    ", implies that in the bulk of the fluid the pressure simply obeys the laplace equation , @xmath58 while at the interface the fact that the air displaces all the fluid is expressed by @xmath59 furthermore , if we ignore the viscosity of the air and wetting effects , the pressure at the interface is nothing but the equilibrium pressure of a smoothly curved air - fluid interface , i.e. , @xmath60 where as before @xmath41 is the surface tension and @xmath61 the background pressure in the gas .",
    "the curvature term @xmath62 is the direct analogue of the one in ( [ dendrbc2 ] ) ; in the context of air - fluid interfaces it is known as the laplace pressure term , and it corresponds to the well - known effect that the pressure inside a soap bubble is larger than the one outside . as in the case of crystal growth discussed above , the form of the boundary conditions can essentially be guessed on physical grounds and by appealing to the fact that the microscopic relaxation time at the interface is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the time and length scale of the pattern .",
    "we finally introduce a problem which is not at all understood in detail but whose similarity with dendrites and viscous fingers motivated some of the issues discussed here @xcite .",
    "the basic phenomenon is that when an electric field is large enough , an electron avalanche type can build up in a gas , due to the fact that free electrons get accelerated sufficiently that they ionize neutral molecules , thus generating more free electrons , etc .",
    "streamers are the type of dielectric breakdown fronts that can occur in gases as a combined result of this avalanche type of phenomenon and the screening of the field due to the build - up of a charge layer .",
    "the basic equations that are being used to model this behavior are the following continuum balance equations for the electron density @xmath63 and ion density @xmath64 , and the electric field @xmath65 @xcite @xmath66 and the poisson equation @xmath67 the electron and ion current densities @xmath68 and @xmath69 are @xmath70 so that @xmath68 is the sum of a drift and a diffusion term , while the ion current @xmath69 is neglected , since the ions are much less mobile than the electrons . the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ stream1 ] ) and ( [ stream2 ] ) is a source term due to the ionization reaction : in high fields free electrons can generate free electrons and ions by impact on neutral molecules .",
    "the source term is given by the magnitude of the electron drift current times the target density times the effective ionization cross section ; the constant @xmath71 in the ionization probability depends on the mean free path of the electrons and the ionization energy of the neutral gas molecules .",
    "the rate constant @xmath72 has the dimension of an inverse length .",
    "the exponential function expresses , that only in high fields electrons have a nonnegligible probability to collect the ionization energy between collisions .    in fig .",
    "[ dendretc](_c _ ) , we show a plot of the simulations of the above equations @xcite . in this figure , a gap between two planar electrodes across which there is a large voltage difference is studied for parameters in the model that correspond to @xmath73 gas . initially , the electron density is essentially zero everywhere except in a very small region near the upper electron . the simulation of fig .",
    "[ dendretc](_c _ ) shows the situation 5.5 nanoseconds later ; the lines in this plot are lines of constant electron density .",
    "the density differs by a factor 10 between successive lines . since these lines are closely spaced",
    " the electron density rises by a factor @xmath74 in a few @xmath48 m  the simulations illustrate that a streamer consists of an ionized region ( inside the contour lines ) propagating into a non - ionized zone . inside this zone , almost all of the ionization takes place , and the total charge density is nonzero .",
    "it is this nonzero charge density that also screens the electric field from the interior of the streamer .",
    "we can therefore also think of the streamer as a moving charge sheet , whose shape is somewhat like a viscous finger .",
    "in fact , if the upper electrode is spherical rather than planar , one finds branched streamers which are reminiscent of dendrites @xcite .",
    "note that in this interfacial picture , the charge sheet is also the reaction zone where most of the ionization takes place , and that the build - up of the charge in this zone is at the same time is responsible for the screening of the field in the interior of the streamer .",
    "an immediate question that comes to mind is whether we can analyze such a streamer as a moving interface problem by mapping the continuum equations onto a a sharp interface of zero thickness , by taking the limit in which the charge sheet becomes infinitely thin @xcite .",
    "if such an analysis can be done , very much along the lines of the analysis for combustion or for the so - called phase - field models mentioned in the introduction , one would intuitively expect that the dynamics in the transition zone would , in the @xmath75 limit , translate into boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "in particular , one expects one equation expressing charge conservation , and a kinematic relation for the normal velocity of the interface . based on ones experience with the other problems described earlier ,",
    "this kinematic expression might be guessed to express the local interface velocity as a function of the instantaneous values of the `` outer '' fields at the interface . as we shall see in section [ theme3 ] , this does not appear to be necessarily possible for front problems like streamers , which correspond to front propagation into _ unstable _ states .",
    "the physical reason that the non - ionized region into which the streamer fronts propagate is unstable , is that as soon as there are free electrons , there is further ionization due to the source term on the right hand side of the streamer equations ( [ stream1 ] ) , ( [ stream2 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an avalanch type of phenomenon , with exponential growth of the electron density , characteristic of a linearly unstable state .",
    "let us nonetheless not let ourselves get discouraged , but follow our nose and assert that if the electron diffusion is small , one would expect that the normal velocity of a streamer front like that of fig .",
    "[ dendretc](_c _ ) is approximately equal to the drift velocity of the electrons on the outer side of the charge sheet , @xmath76 here @xmath7 is the electrical potential , @xmath77 , and the superscript + indicates the value of the field at the charge sheet , extrapolated from the non - ionized region .",
    "a linear relation , like ( [ streamvn ] ) is indeed found to a good approximation for negatively charged streamers @xcite .",
    "now , in the non - ionized region outside the streamer , the charge density is essentially zero [ @xmath78 in ( [ stream4 ] ) ] , and hence here @xmath79 thus we see that if we do think of a streamer sheet as a moving charge sheet and assume that the potential inside the streamer is roughly constant due to the high mobility of the electrons , it falls within the same class of gradient driven problems as dendrites and viscous fingers : the normal velocity of the charge sheet is proportional to the gradient of a field @xmath2 , which itself obeys a laplace or diffusion equation .",
    "we now discuss the mullins - sekerka instability of a planar interface .",
    "we will first follow the standard analysis for the simplest case of a planar solidification interface @xcite , and then indicate why in the long wavelength limit the same instability happens for all gradient - driven fronts whose outer field obeys a laplace or diffusion equation .",
    "the analysis of the planar interface appears at first sight to be somewhat of an academic problem , as we will find such an interface to be unstable .",
    "however , the analysis does identify the basic physics that is responsible for the formation of natural growth shapes and it helps us to identify the proper length scale for the growth shapes that result ( the form of the dispersion relation also plays a role in analytical approaches to the dendrite and viscous finger problem @xcite ) .",
    "= 3.5 cm    we want to consider the stability of a planar interface which grows with velocity @xmath80 .",
    "to do so , we write the diffusion equation in a frame @xmath81 moving with velocity @xmath80 in the @xmath82-direction , @xmath83 note that now @xmath84 denotes the laplacian in the moving @xmath85 frame .",

    "more importantly , however , the dla growth process is intrinsically noisy as one particle is added at a time , and as there is no relaxation at the boundary of the cluster . as pointed out by kadanoff _",
    "@xcite , the noise can be suppressed by having a cluster grow only at a site once that site has been visited a number of times by a random walker , and by allowing particles at the perimeter to detach and re - attach to the cluster with a probability that depends on the number of neighbors at each site",

    "the answer to this question , namely that this typically can be done for problems in which the interface separates two ( meta)stable states or phases may not be that surprising .",

    "such a solution corresponds to a front which moves to the right so that the @xmath178 domain expands . in the opposite case , when the potential at @xmath168 is lower than at 0 so that @xmath187 , then such a solution only exists for `` negative friction '' so that enough energy is pumped into the system that the particle can climb the center hill .",
    "negative friction corresponds to a left - moving front with @xmath188 , so that the @xmath189 domain expands .",

    "clearly , the second term is exactly what we could have guessed on the basis of what we already knew before , and together with the curvature term it has exactly the same type of structure as the boundary condition ( [ dendrbc2 ] ) that we introduced in our first discussion of solidification .",
    "the complications that are necessary to model anisotropic kinetics and surface tension with a phase - field model are significant @xcite , but conceptually the analysis is essentially the same .    by taking big steps ,",
    "we have not done justice to the systematics of the analysis , and there is much more to say about it . if you want to know more , you will find entries to the literature in @xcite .",
    "however , the point we want to bring to the foreground , following @xcite is that in all such approaches , a hidden assumption is made in writing the inner expansion as @xmath311 in ( [ inner ] ) . in doing so",

    "however , the coupling of the phase field with the outer pressure - like field was such that the equations were completely unstable on the inner scale for small @xmath278 .",

    "we now briefly touch on a few elements of fronts propagating into unstable states . in view of the length restrictions on the contribution to the proceedings of the school , we only highlight some recent results obtained in collaboration with ebert @xcite , which show that a large class of fronts propagating into an unstable state show universal power law relaxation and that this makes the mapping of such fronts onto an effective interface model questionable .",
    "our own motivation comes from our attempt to understand the streamer problem , but examples of fronts propagating into an unstable state arise in various fields of physics : they are important in many convective instabilities in fluid dynamics such as the onset of von karman vortex generation @xcite , in taylor @xcite and rayleigh - bnard @xcite convection , they play a role in spinodal decomposition near a wall @xcite , the pearling instability of laser - tweezed membranes @xcite , the formation of kinetic , transient microstructures in structural phase transitions @xcite , the propagation of a superconducting front into an unstable normal metal @xcite , or in error propagation in extended chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental relevance of the understanding of the relaxation of such fronts is illustrated on propagating taylor vortex fronts . here",
    "the measured velocities were about 40% lower than predicted theoretically @xcite , and only later numerical simulations @xcite showed that this was due to slow transients .",
    "when one of the states is unstable , even a small perturbation around this state will grow out and spread ; therefore , the properties of fronts that propagate into an unstable state depend on the initial conditions . if the initial profile is steep enough , arising , e.g. , through local initial perturbations , it is known that the propagating front in practice always relaxes to a unique profile and velocity @xcite .",
    "depending on the nonlinearities , one generally can distinguish two regimes : as a rule , fronts whose propagation is driven ( `` pushed '' ) by the nonlinearities , resemble very much the fronts which propagate into a metastable state and which we have discussed extensively in section [ theme2 ] ( e.g. , their relaxation is also exponential in time ) .",
    "we will therefore not consider this regime , which is often refered to as `` pushed '' @xcite or `` nonlinear marginal stability '' @xcite any further . if , on the other hand , nonlinearities mainly cause saturation , fronts propagate with a velocity determined by linearization about the unstable state , as if they are `` pulled '' by the linear stability ( `` pulled '' @xcite or `` linear marginal stability '' @xcite regime ) .    almost all important differences between `` pulled '' or `` linear marginal stability '' fronts propagating into an unstable state and those propagating into a metastable state trace back to the fact that in the latter case there typically is a discrete set of front solutions , only one of which is stable as was illustrated in fig .",

    "<S> in these lecture notes , we discuss at an elementary level three themes concerning interface dynamics that play a role in pattern forming systems : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ we briefly review three examples of systems in which the normal growth velocity is proportional to the gradient of a bulk field which itself obeys a laplace or diffusion type of equation ( solidification , viscous fingers and streamers ) , and then discuss why the mullins - sekerka instability is common to all such gradient systems . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ secondly , we discuss how underlying an effective interface description of systems with smooth fronts or transition zones , is the assumption that the relaxation time of the appropriate order parameter field(s ) in the front region is much smaller than the time scale of the evolution of interfacial patterns . </S>",
    "<S> using standard arguments we illustrate that this is generally so for fronts that separate two ( meta)stable phases : in such cases , the relaxation is typically exponential , and the relaxation time in the usual models goes to zero in the limit in which the front width vanishes . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) _ we finally summarize recent results that show that so - called `` pulled '' or `` linear marginal stability '' fronts which propagate into unstable states have a very slow universal power law relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> this slow relaxation makes the usual `` moving boundary '' or `` effective interface '' approximation for problems with thin fronts , like streamers , impossible . </S>"
