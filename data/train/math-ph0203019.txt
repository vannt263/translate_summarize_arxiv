    "the bulk hamiltonian @xmath3 is of the same form , except that the lattice is @xmath46 .",
    "it should restrict to @xmath1 on the upper half - plane under some largely arbitrary boundary condition .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath47 denote the extension by @xmath48 .",

    "we consider the gauge transformation ( [ eq:3 ] ) with @xmath59 having @xmath60 $ ] , so that @xmath61 is supported in a wedge pointing upwards .",

    "indeed , in both cases the heuristic argument , explained in more detail in @xcite , sect .",
    "5 , is that the trace in ( [ eq:4 ] ) counts the number of electrons which are pulled to infinity as the gauge field is switched on adiabatically starting from zero to a flux quantum , see fig .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] .",
    "that number may also by computed by integrating the current @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 denoting a rotation by @xmath70 ) over time and across a large circle @xmath71 enclosing the flux . here",
    "@xmath72 is the electric field accompanying the change of magnetic field , and is the same on @xmath71 in the two cases .",
    "since the phenomenological equation ( [ eq : hall ] ) is valid only well inside the sample , it is crucial that the isolines of the gauge transformation run to infinity through the upper half - plane , so that @xmath73 vanishes where @xmath71 crosses the boundary of the sample .",
    "it appears reasonable , even without recourse to ( [ eq : hall ] ) , that for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( [ eq:4 ] ) tends to @xmath24 as defined in ( [ eq:1a ] ) . as for @xmath64 note that @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a single - valued function over the sample and , for @xmath78 close to the boundary",

    "the trouble with this explanation for @xmath81 is that none of the traces starting with ( [ eq:4 ] ) , except for the last one , is well - defined .",
    "in fact , one has the weaker property @xmath82 for @xmath18 a switch function ( but notice that as a rule even this fails if @xmath18 is taken as a step function , a fact related to theorem  3.11 in @xcite ) .",
    "put differently : the formal eigenvalue sum represented by ( [ eq:4 ] ) is not absolutely convergent , but exhibits strong cancellations between small eigenvalues of opposite sign ( which are exact except for @xmath83 in a bulk situation , where @xmath84 is a projection @xcite ) .",
    "let therefore @xmath85 be an odd function with @xmath86 interpolating between @xmath87 ( as @xmath88 and @xmath12 ( as @xmath89 ) . for definiteness",
    "we take @xmath90 we regard @xmath91 as a replacement for @xmath92 , when the latter is not defined . but first we pass to a more general setting . + we consider a fixed bounded operator @xmath93 ( typically not a projection ! ) on a hilbert space @xmath94 equipped with a fixed orthonormal basis @xmath95 .",
