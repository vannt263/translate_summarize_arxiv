    "the madison plasma dynamo experiment ( mpdx ) is designed to create a steady - state , hot , weakly magnetized , flowing plasma in which the kinetic energy of the flow drives magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities .",
    "such a device accesses a new regime relevant to astrophysical applications and never before achieved in a laboratory@xcite .",
    "this plasma is well - suited for studying astrophysical phenomena such as the dynamo process @xcite , the feasibility of which is the topic of several recent publications @xcite and is investigated in section [ subsect_scenarios ] . the magneto - rotational instability ( mri)@xcite could also be investigated using the tunable boundary driven flow or a supplemental central spinning post in conjunction with an external helmholtz coil .",
    "in addition , many basic plasma physics studying interactions and organization of flows and magnetic fields can be performed .",
    "previous and ongoing dynamo experiments @xcite use flowing liquid metals which can be stirred mechanically and confined with a simple vessel .",
    "these interesting experiments suffer from several limitations which can be avoided by using plasmas .",
    "first , the magnetic reynolds number achieved in liquid metal experiments , which governs the transition to a dynamo , is too low . the magnetic reynolds number @xmath11v@xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the characteristic size , and @xmath14 the resistivity and v is the flow velocity ) is the ratio of magnetic field advection by the flow to magnetic field diffusion from the resistivity . in liquid metal experiments ,",
    "@xmath15 is typically less than @xmath16 necessary for dynamo and mri excitation .",
    "in addition , the fluid reynolds number , which is the ratio of the momentum advection by the flow to the momentum diffusion by the viscosity @xmath17v@xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the viscosity ) , can not be varied independently of @xmath15 in liquid metals .",
    "the ratio of these quantities , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath20 is a fixed , very small value @xmath21 in liquid metal ; thus , the flows required to exceed @xmath16 are always turbulent . in plasmas , by contrast , @xmath15 can be varied independently of @xmath22 by controlling the plasma resistivity and viscosity by changing the electron temperature , the plasma density , and the ion species .",
    "@xmath23 is achievable in mpdx making these plasmas are excellent candidates for dynamo action and comparison to simulations . in addition ,",
    "laminar dynamo action ( @xmath24 ) can be studied in the absence of fluid turbulence which can suppress it@xcite .    to experimentally test theories about the dynamo mechanism in a plasma , the device operates in the _ flow - dominated _ regime as opposed to the _ magnetically - dominated _ regime .",
    "such an experiment requires not only that @xmath15 be large , but also that the flow energy dominates over the magnetic energy .",
    "this is quantified by the alfvn mach number squared @xmath8v@xmath9v@xmath25 which is the ratio of the inertial force to the magnetic force , where v@xmath26 is the alfvn velocity .",

    "the plasma parameters and relevant dimensionless parameters are adjusted by controlling the neutral fill pressure , input power , gas species , and torques imposed on the plasma edge .",
    "the mpdx uses several well - established techniques to confine and stir a hot , unmagnetized plasma .",
    "first , an axisymmetric multipole magnetic ring cusp built from alternating rings of individual permanent magnets creates a strong magnetic field localized to the edge , forming a magnetic bucket to confine the plasma .",
    "second , biased hot cathodes draw current to induce an @xmath41 rotation to stir the edge of the plasma .",
