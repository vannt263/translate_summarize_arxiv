    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are thought to be the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars .",
    "the light curves of sne ia are powered by the deposition of energy into the sn ejecta from the gamma - ray and positron products of the @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3co @xmath4 @xmath5fe decay @xcite . the extreme brightness and seemingly uniform light curves of sne",
    "ia make them good candidates for use as standard candle distance indicators , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "in more recent years , it has been shown that type ia supernovae do not have entirely uniform peak luminosities , light curve shapes , or spectra .",
    "they can , however , be normalized to account for inhomogeneity , thus allowing these objects to be used as standard candle distance indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "light curves can be separated into three luminosity categories , normally luminous ( n ) , super - luminous ( sp ) , and subluminous ( sb ) , based on light curve shape , which also correlates with some spectral features ( see @xcite for a study of the frequency of each sub - class ) .",
    "one measure of these classes is the @xcite luminosity - width relation , @xmath6 , which is defined as the decline in b - band magnitude in the first fifteen days after peak , where slower declining sne are brighter than faster declining sne .",
    "an empirical relationship for the correlation between @xmath6 value and late light curve shape was derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mtl01 ) , showing the break between the n / sp and the sb classes to be 1.60 . in that study",
    "there were no sne in the data set with @xmath6 values between 1.50 - 1.68 so the exact location of the break is undetermined .",
    "the issue is further complicated by sn 1986 g , which has @xmath7 , but shows characteristics of sb sne up to 200 days after explosion but n / sp sne after 200 days @xcite . for this work",
    ", we consider all sne ia which have @xmath6 values smaller than 1.68 to be normally- or super - luminous .",
    "the sub - classes of sne ia were also spectroscopically defined by @xcite .    between 100 - 200 days after the explosion",
    "the ejecta become transparent to the @xmath5co @xmath2 @xmath5fe - decay @xmath8-rays and the light curve is powered by the deposition of the positron kinetic energy into the ejecta .",
    "this work concentrates solely upon this  positron phase \" during which the energy deposition is dominated by the slowing of the energetic positrons via collisions with the bound and free electrons of the ejecta .",
    "the escape of a fraction of these positrons from the ejecta has been suggested as a possible source of the galactic 511 kev annihilation radiation provided certain conditions exists in the ejecta to permit escape ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mtl99 ) . at late epochs , gamma - rays",
    "escape the ejecta in abundance , leading to the deposition of kinetic energy from non - thermal positrons dominating the total energy deposition .",
    "many groups have done work in simulation and observation during this epoch in attempts to determine if positrons do escape the ejecta in significant quantities , or alternatively are trapped to deposit 100% of their kinetic energy and annihilate in the ejecta .",
    "the primary goal of observing the late emission of sne ia is to determine whether some of the positrons do escape the ejecta , or whether all are trapped to annihilate and deposit their kinetic energy into the ejecta .",
    "these studies are based upon demonstrating that : 1 ) the decay products of @xmath5co  @xmath2  @xmath5fe decays can acceptably account for the spectra and light curves of sne ia , and more subtly , that 2 ) the energy deposition rate of the escape or trapping simulations provides the superior agreement with the observations than the other . in this work ,",
    "we present bvri light curves of seven normally- or super - luminous sne ia .",
    "the goal of these observations is to better understand late optical light curves , which will eventually lead to the correct determination of whether positrons escape the ejecta of this sub - class of sn ia events .",
    "positrons are created in sn ia ejecta via the decay chain of @xmath5ni @xmath2 @xmath5co @xmath2 @xmath5fe .",
    "whether any of these positrons escape the ejecta into the galaxy is an unsolved problem , a problem that can be addressed through determining the energy deposition rate in the sn ejecta .",
    "as positrons are charged particles , their movement through the sn ejecta is determined by the magnetic field in the ejecta . a weak magnetic field and/or",
    "a radially - combed magnetic field would permit the @xmath5co @xmath2 @xmath5fe decay positrons to diffuse through the ejecta with an increasing fraction being able to escape the ejecta after roughly 100 days , a possibility suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , , mtl99 and mtl01 have all performed simulations assuming a weak and/or radially - combed field and support the suggestion that a small fraction of these positrons could escape .    by contrast , a strong , tangled magnetic field would trap all positrons and lead to complete deposition of positron kinetic energy into the ejecta .",
    "the positrons would develop non - negligible lifetimes after @xmath9150 days , but eventually almost 100% of the positron energy would be deposited into the ejecta .",
    "this mechanism to temporarily store decay energy in the form of positron kinetic energy makes the energy deposition rates for this trapping scenario larger at late times than the assumption of _ in - situ _ deposition of 100% of the positron kinetic energy that is often made for sn ia .",
    "we note that the energy deposition rates for the trapping scenario and _ in - situ _ assumption are very similar compared to the difference between these rates and the rate for the positron escape secenarios .",
    "energy deposition will differ between the two scenarios in two ways .",
    "first , the total energy deposition rate will be higher for the trapping scenario , as in the escape scenario positrons increasingly escape , carrying away energy that is deposited in the trapping scenario .",
    "second , in the escape scenario , positrons diffuse to non-@xmath5ni rich regions of the ejecta , whereas in the trapping scenario the positrons remain in the iron - rich regions of the ejecta .",
    "this diffusion leads to energy deposition in regions that differ in both composition and density compared to the trapping scenario . for the trapping scenario ,",
    "the only source of energy diffusion comes from the interactions of the gamma - ray photons , which at that epoch are the secondary energy deposition source .",
    "these scenarios can thus potentially be distinguished both through comparisons of the bolometric light curves with simulated energy deposition rates , and through detailed study of the late - epoch spectra ( studying both the elements that contribute to the spectra as well as their ionization states ) .",
    "energy deposition in the ejecta is what gives rise to the emission from the sn , but detailed radiation transport simulations must be performed in order to generate the full spectrum of light that emerges from the sn ejecta .",
    "the interactions of positrons with the ejecta give rise to many ionized and excited electrons for each positron , electrons that recombine to produce the optical , uv , nir , ir emission .",
    "the sn is constantly expanding such that no region could be considered in equilibrium , making estimation of the detailed ionization structure complex .",
    "this is made even more difficult by the imperfect knowledge of the atomic physics that govern the various transitions that give rise to the forbidden lines of cobalt and iron that dominate the late , nebular spectra .",
    "two early efforts at simulating the late emission from sne ia were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two efforts treated the radiation transport quite differently , and will be explained separately .",
    "@xcite evolved a model to @xmath9700 d post - explosion assuming _ in - situ _ energy deposition and that the ionization state of the ejecta is dictated by collisional processes ( and thus could be characterized by a temperature ) .",
    "he found that one consequence of the radiation transport was that the ejecta progressively cooled with time , leading to an increasing fraction of the emission coming out in the infrared .",
    "as the infrared photons only weakly interact with the ejecta , this mechanism efficiently cools the ejecta after roughly 500 days post - explosion .",
    "since the infrared wavelengths have historically been unobservable , this phenomenon was named the  infrared catastrophe \" , or  irc \" .",
    "comparisons between energy deposition rates and observations would require either complete coverage of the uv / opt / ir wavelength ranges , or detailed modeling of the evolution of the bolometric correction of each photometric band with time .",
    "stated differently , the optical bands became increasingly poorer tracers of the bolometric luminosity ( and thus the energy deposition rate ) with time .",
    "included in that study was a comparison with a @xmath9700 days optical spectrum sn 1972e , which was suitably explained by the model spectrum .",
    "the core - collapse sn 1987a , the best observed sn in history , exhibited light curves and spectra that were well - fitted with simulations that feature cooling as with the irc .",
    "lowering of the ionization state with time was thus observed for a core - collapse sn , which motivated efforts to simulate a sn ia with the same code .",
    "@xcite , authors of the highly successful fits to sn 1987a , studied the irc and sn ia light curves in great detail , finding that the code that reproduced the emission from sn 1987a generated a steep drop in the optical light curves beginning at roughly 500 days for sn ia models , a feature inconsistent with the ubv photometry of sn 1972e .",
    "a number of ideas as to what might lead to the failure of the simulations were explored , 1 ) whether shortcomings of the atomic physics ( i.e. estimates of the transition probabilities ) falsely shorten the timescale of the onset of the irc , 2 ) whether sne ia possess additional energy input sources not treated in the models ( more @xmath5ni produced in the explosion and/or additional radioactivities ) , 3 ) asymmetries not treated in the 1d simulations ( global or otherwise ) produce an excess at late times . when combined with the lack of observational evidence of ejecta cooling , it was unclear whether color evolution occurred at significant levels in sne ia , thus the problem was left as unresolved in that work .",
    "by contrast , @xcite suggested that the radiative transitions occurred on a shorter timescale than collisions during the nebular phase , and that the ionization state would not change appreciably at late times .",
    "if this were indeed the case , then photometry in any single band would trace the bolometric luminosity ( and thus the energy deposition rate ) accurately enough to differentiate between positron transport scenarios .",
    "colgate , petschek & kreise fitted simulations to the b - band photometry of sn 1937c & 1972e , and concluded that the light curves supported the positron escape scenario .",
    "a number of subsequent works have performed either positron transport or radiation transport , comparing their simulations with observed photometry and spectra .",
    "determined , using v - band light curves as tracers for the bolometric luminosity , that varying degrees of positron escape occur for different sne ia .",
    "@xcite compared pseudo - bolometric light curves generated from bvri photometry for sn 1972e , sn 1991bg , and 1992a to models and saw suggestions of positron escape in some sne ia .",
    "mtl99 studied the v and b band light curves of 10 sne ia and concluded that for the normally- and super - luminous sne ia , positron escape better explained the light curves than positron trapping .",
    "that study was followed by a study of the bvri light curves of 22 sne ia ( mtl01 ) .",
    "the second study confirmed the differences between the late light curves of normally- and super - luminous versus subluminous sne ia .",
    "it also showed that a pseudo - bolometric light curve created from the bvri light curves is steeper than the trapping energy deposition rate , but roughly equal to the positron escape energy deposition rate .",
    "all of those studies discussed discriminating between positron escape scenarios , but employed only optical light curves , in particular v and b band photometry .",
    "implicit in all of those comparisons was the assumption that color evolution was not significant enough to invalidate the use of optical light curves to trace the bolometric light curve ( and thus the energy deposition rate ) . with the study of sn 2000cx ,",
    "it became clear that studies of the optical wavelength range are not sufficient to characterize the bolometric light curves of sne ia .",
    "a fundamental prediction of published radiation transport simulations is that the iron - peak elements will transition from doubly - ionized to singly - ionized to neutral with time .",
    "that leads to transitions from emission primarily in the optical wavelength range to an increasing fraction in the nir , then ( at still later times ) to emission primarily in the ir .",
    "thus , hints of the impending irc could potentially be seen in a flattening of the nir light curves .",
    "observations of sn 2000cx between 350 - 500 days post - explosion in the optical and nir afforded the first opportunity to search for these transitions .",
    "showed photometry that for the first time included nir emission after 300 days .",
    "whereas the optical photometric bands are similar to other sne ia ( suggesting that sn 2000cx was not anomalous at late times ) , the nir light curves were flat , showing no fading at all during that epoch .",
    "in addition , the i band was found to have a shallower slope than the b , v & r bands .",
    "a bolometric light curve created from that bvrijh photometry suggested that the bolometric light curve is flatter than the v band light curve .",
    "thus , while the v band follows a steeper slope consistent with the slope of the energy deposition rates with positron escape , the bolometric light curve follows the shallower slope that suggests positron trapping .",
    "then fitted radiation transport simulations of bvrijh light curves to the sn 2000cx data .",
    "the simulations featured optical light curves that were steeper than the nir light curves , although the simulated light curves had a strong dependence upon the uncertainty about how to treat the photoionization .",
    "as the model assumed instantaneous , _ in - situ _ deposition of positron kinetic energy , these simulations presented a scenario where the light curves of sne ia are consistent with positron trapping .",
    "the simulations presented in featured an irc delayed to later epochs than previous simulations , but by 600 days the optical and nir bands were predicted to rapidly fade , a tendency that was not consistent with the latest epoch observations of sn 2000cx , nor with 600 + day optical observations of other sne ia .",
    "the version of the simulations that included photoionization featured a delayed fading of the optical bands , which is important to explain the @xmath9 700 day v band detection of sn 2000cx , as well as optical band detections of other sne ia .",
    "the simulations also fitted a 360 day spectrum of sn 2000cx , arriving at the slightly contradictory finding that the version of the simulations * without * photoionization provided a better fit than including photoionization .",
    "indeed , a number of other spectral studies appear to produce better fits to nebular spectra than the fits shown in ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". nonetheless , the spectral fits are certainly good enough to provide bolometric corrections at the level of accuracy to combine the bvrijh light curves into a uvoir bolometric light curve .",
    "sn 2000cx was considered an anomalous sn ia , as the near - peak b - band photometry crossed the standard sn ia templates @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been considered possible that features of the late light curves of sn 2000cx are not typical of sne ia in general .",
    "one argument against that view is that the j & h band photometry of sn 2000cx appears to be consistent with h - band spectro - photometry of sn 1998bu .",
    "nir spectra of sn 1998bu were fitted with a model dominated by fe ii and co ii features , confirming that the nir emission is due to singly - ionized iron - peak elements .",
    "introduce the possibility of a partial cooling , where the iron - peak elements cool to the singly ionized state , but not to the neutral state ( at least during the observed epochs ) .",
    "two consequences of that possibility would be : 1 ) the optical and nir light curves not falling steeply and 2 ) the ir emission would not brighten ( i.e. there is color evolution into the nir , but there is no irc ) .",
    "another study shows that the normally - luminous sn 2003cg ( @xmath10 ) also exhibits a bright nir / optical ratio at 400 days after the peak luminosity @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the late nir emission from sn 2000cx was not anomalous .",
    "as sn 2000cx was one of the sne observed in this study , we will further show that the late optical emission from sn 2000cx is also not anomalous .",
    "first we present the observations and derived quantities , and then we discuss our findings in the context of the energy deposition and ionization state of the sn ejecta .",
    "the data for this project were obtained with both the bok 90 `` ( 2.3-m ) telescope on kitt peak and the kuiper 61 '' ( 1.6-m ) telescope on mt .",

    "the light curves shown in figure [ radmodel ] represent data from seven sne ia , but show very little deviation from a single curve for each photometric band .",
    "this suggests that positron transport and the resulting levels of ionization from these sub - classes of sne ia do not occur on a sn - by - sn basis , rather it is more likely that there is a single answer to the question of positron escape .",
    "the flatness of the i band data is an optical wavelength confirmation of the fact that color evolution does occur in the light curves of the n / sp sne ia and must be accounted for to accurately produce bolometric light curves to compare with energy deposition rates .",
    "although the radiation transport simulations provide an acceptable fit to the light curves of the b , v and r bands , the color evolution as simulated does not account for the flatness of the i band light curve .",
    "efforts to fit the ( sparse ) sampling of late , nebular spectra of n / sp sne ia have demonstrated that the emission after 200 days is dominated by forbidden lines from fe ii and fe iii , as well as from contributions from stable co ii / co iii and ni ii / ni iii .",
    "the nir spectral range contains only lines from singly - ionized iron - peak elements , so the flat nir light curves would presumably be due to an increase in the fraction of singly - ionized iron - peak elements . if this is indeed the correct explanation for the nir light curve slopes , it is not clear why the i - band emission follows a slope intermediate to the b , v , r and j , h , k slopes .",
    "we have presented bvri photometry of seven normally - luminous type ia supernovae at epochs out to @xmath45 days past explosion , roughly doubling the available data for the late epochs . the resulting b , v and i band light curves do not show any evidence of inhomogeneity within the n / sp subclasses of sne ia . there is also no evidence that the very late time b & v band light curves start to rapidly dim , which would indicate the start of an irc .",
    "however , it is clear from the results of these observations and the nir observations of sne 1998bu , 2000cx and 2003cg that more optical / nir observations of these objects at late times are needed to determine if the shallower i - band slope is due to the emission shifting into the longer wavelengths and to reproduce the flat nir light curves of sn 2000cx .",
    "the core question as to whether positrons escape the sn ejecta can not be answered based only upon the optical photometry of sne ia .",
    "as the number of sne ia detected in the nir increases , so does the evidence for a nir excess that is suggestive of positron trapping . this optical study supports previous claims that there is little variation among the light curves of n / sp sne ia late times .",
    "this lack of variation suggests that if trapping is the better explanation for one n / sp sn ia , it is the better explanation for all n / sp sne ia ( at least until which time an anomalous late light curve is detected ) .",
    "radiation transport simulations have never been performed upon sn models that allow for positron diffusion throughout the ejecta with a fraction escaping the ejecta . until such simulations are performed and compared to the observations ,",
    "it is premature to conclude that positrons are trapped inside the sn ejecta .",
    "however , it does appear that radiation transport simulations that include models that trap positrons can reproduce the general features of the late sn ia light curves .",
    "it is a challenge for simulators to determine whether the shortcomings of the current simulations point to small issues in the simulations within the positron trapping scenario , or to the need for some degree of positron diffusion and escape .",
