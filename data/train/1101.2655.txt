    "it is becoming increasingly apparent that growing length scales can be associated with the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics in glass - forming systems .",
    "one such length scale characterizes the spatial extent of the so - called dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "it has been found that upon approaching the glass transition the particles motion becomes increasingly heterogeneous and the particles can be divided into `` slow '' and `` fast '' sub - sets @xcite .",
    "these sub - sets can be seen as distinct peaks in the probability of the logarithm of single particle displacements @xmath11 $ ] @xcite .",
    "importantly , the slow and fast particles are not uniformly distributed in space , but form clusters whose size increases as the dynamics slows .",
    "the average spatial extent of the clusters of slow particles can be defined as a dynamic correlation length .",
    "this dynamic correlation length and other closely related lengths have been studied in simulations @xcite , experiments @xcite , and discussed theoretically @xcite .    one convenient way to characterize the spatial extent of the clusters",
    "is to identify the slow particles and then determine their spatial correlations . in simulational investigations",
    "this is typically done by analyzing the so - called four - point dynamic structure factors @xmath12 .",
    "the four - point structure factor quantifies spatial correlations between the slow particles .",
    "the label `` four - point '' refers to the fact that @xmath12 is a correlation function of two two - point functions that are used to characterize particles dynamics and to define slow particles .",
    "examples of these two point functions are the microscopic intermediate scattering functions and overlap functions , but other functions have also been used in the literature .",
    "of particular interest are two quantities that can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 : the dynamic susceptibility , @xmath13 , which is a measure of the overall strength of the dynamic heterogeneity , and the dynamic correlation length , @xmath2 , which characterizes its spatial extent .",
    "the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 provides insight into the fractal dimension of the slow particles clusters .    in spite of a relatively straightforward definition of @xmath1 ,",
    "its direct simulational evaluation suffers from a technical difficulty .",
    "the difficulty originates from the fact that in a typical simulational ensemble some global fluctuations are suppressed . for example , in most simulations of glass - forming liquids the number of particles and the volume is kept constant , thus the density of the system is constant and global density fluctuations do not contribute to the direct simulational calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that these suppressed fluctuations can be calculated utilizing a procedure derived by lebowitz _",
    "this procedure results in a two - part expression for the dynamic susceptibility , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the susceptibility in an ensemble with @xmath16 kept fixed ( which can readily be obtained from simulations ) and @xmath17 is a correction term .",
    "berthier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite furthermore noted that while @xmath15 can not be easily determined experimentally , the correction term @xmath17 can .",
    "this fact , together with the positive definite character of the former term , @xmath18 , provides an experimental lower bound for @xmath1 . however , the relative size of @xmath1 and the correction term remained an open question .",
    "in addition , even if the experimental lower bound was a good estimate of @xmath1 , there was no reliable correlation between @xmath1 and the dynamic correlation length @xmath2 .",
    "the relative size of the two terms contributing to @xmath1 was investigated by berthier _",
    "_ @xcite and by brambilla _",
    "the main conclusion was that as the dynamics slows , the correction term becomes an increasingly better approximation for the ensemble independent @xmath1 .",
    "the assessment and extension of this result is one of the subjects of the present paper .",
    "there were several earlier simulational investigations @xcite of the correlation between the dynamic susceptibility @xmath1 and the correlation length @xmath2 and between the average dynamics ( as characterized by , _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath4 relaxation time , @xmath7 ) and @xmath2 , but their results , by and large , disagreed @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been realized that in order to get reliable results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 one has to simulate systems considerably larger than was customary @xcite . in an earlier short note @xcite",

    "in addition , we analyze the time dependence of both the dynamic susceptibility and correlation length , and investigate additional correlations between the length and the average dynamics .",
