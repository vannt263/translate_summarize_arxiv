    "recently the proximity effect of unconventional superconductors has been a subject of intensive study @xcite .",
    "this is because the interface properties of these superconductors can be quite different from those of conventional ( @xmath5-wave ) ones due to the nontrivial angular structure of pair wave functions , so that their study is of particular interest .",
    "the proximity effect between unconventional superconductors and magnetic materials is an important problem , since there are competition and the possible coexistence of two kinds of orders .",
    "the unconventional superconductivity is usually induced by the magnetic interaction , and the existence of nodes in the gap is favorable for the coexistence compared with the case of conventional superconductors .",
    "if the magnetism and superconductivity coexist near the interface , the electronic properties of the surface state become quite unusual .",
    "in particular the spin - triplet superconducting order parameter ( scop ) can be induced near the surface of spin - singlet superconductors@xcite .",
    "( similar effects for conventional @xmath5-wave superconductors and ferromagnets have been studied in @xcite . )    in this paper we study the proximity effect between ferromagnets and unconventional superconductors with @xmath2-wave and @xmath4-wave symmetries .",
    "the former state is realized in high-@xmath6 cuprates@xcite , while the latter is a candidate of the superconducting ( sc ) state of sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8@xcite .",
    "it is known that near the [ 110 ] surface of the @xmath2-wave superconductor the system may break time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath0 ) by introducing second component of scop@xcite , and that a spontaneous current and fractional vortices may occur at the surface if @xmath0 is broken@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-wave sc states also break @xmath0 and the spontaneous current arises at the edge of the system@xcite .",
    "when a ferromagnet is attached to these unconventional superconductors , the magnetization may be induced in the latter due to the proximity effect@xcite .",
    "then it may be expected that a spontaneous spin current can appear along the interface between a @xmath0-breaking superconductor and a ferromagnet , because there is an imbalance of the densities of spin - up and spin - down electrons .",
    "we will show that it is actually possible for the superconductor with @xmath4-wave symmetry , but not in the case of @xmath2-wave symmetry@xcite .",
    "( spin currents in the case of interfaces between @xmath5-wave superconductors and ferromagnets have been found in @xcite , though their treatment of the magnetization is not fully self - consistent . )",
    "the system we consider is a two - dimensional ferromagnet(f)/superconductor(s ) bilayer and f / s / f trilayer systems , and we treat [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] interfaces as schematically depicted in fig.1 . the directions perpendicular ( parallel ) to the interfaces",

    "is treated within the mean - field ( mf ) approximation@xcite , and we consider only the case of zero temperature ( @xmath14 ) .",

    "parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the transfer integral , the on - site interaction and the nearest - neighbor interaction , respectively , for the @xmath24 side .",
    "the transmission of electrons at the interface is described by the following tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denotes the surface sites of @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) layer , and then the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the chemical potential .",
    "the interaction terms are decoupled within the mf approximation : @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 and the magnetization @xmath35 ( perpendicular to the plane ) are the op s to be determined self - consistently . the scop with each symmetry can be formed by combining @xmath34 s : @xmath36 ( @xmath2-wave ) , @xmath37 ( extended @xmath5-wave ) , @xmath38 ( @xmath39-wave ) , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the spin - singlet and the spin - triplet pairing op s , respectively .",
    "we impose the open ( periodic ) boundary condition for the @xmath9 and @xmath11 ( @xmath10 and @xmath12 ) directions for [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] interfaces , respectively , and carry out the fourier transformation along the @xmath10- and @xmath12-directions .",

    "was examined by hirsch@xcite .",
    "we use this result to choose the parameters to realize the ferromagnetic state in the f layer . the phase diagram in the case of @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "was also studied , and the @xmath2- , extended @xmath5- and @xmath4-wave sc state appears depending on the band filling@xcite .",
    "various sc states can occur in the model with a single type of ( nearest - neighbor attractive ) interaction because of the change of the shape of the fermi surface@xcite .",

    "we will use finite values of @xmath82 to investigate the effect of electron correlations in the s side , while the attractive interaction in the f side is assumed to be absent , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath84 as the unit of energy , and the tunneling matrix element @xmath85 is varied to see how the extent of the proximity effect is changed .",

    "the spin - singlet components are not induced , though the @xmath97-wave scop s are suppressed also in this case@xcite .",
    "this difference is due to the presence of @xmath27 in the s side , because the sc state can not be formed with @xmath4-channel only , if @xmath98 . the proximity effects will be reduced as the tunneling matrix element becomes smaller .",
    "this is actually the case as seen in fig.3 where @xmath99 is used .",
    "it is seen that the penetration of @xmath27 into the s side is suppressed , and @xmath81- and @xmath5-wave scop s are much smaller compared with fig.2 .",
    "the change of the surface states , as @xmath85 is varied , is rather simple in the case of @xmath4-wave superconductors .",

    "( on the contrary , the surface state of a @xmath81-wave superconductor shows a phase transition when @xmath85 is varied , as we will see in the next section . )",

    "this is because the penetration of @xmath27 into the s side is suppressed ( fig.3 ) , and then the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath112 is reduced .",
    "when the @xmath4-wave superconductor is faced to vacuum , only a charge current arises and no spin current shows up @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85-dependence of spin currents presented here is consistent with this fact .",
    "when the effect of electron correlations is important in the s side , @xmath113 is reduced but @xmath114 is not ( fig.5(c ) ) .",
    "this is because a large @xmath102 suppresses @xmath115 s leading to a reduced @xmath113 , while it enhances @xmath27 and @xmath114 .",
    "the spin current also becomes larger as the value of @xmath82 is increased ( fig.5(d ) with @xmath116 ) , since @xmath27 in the f side is enhanced leading to larger value of @xmath27 in the s side . to summarize the discussion of the spin current in bilayer systems",
    ", @xmath114 can be large if the magnetization induced in the s side is large .",
    "we have also investigated the case of [ 110 ] interface between a @xmath4-wave superconductor and a ferromagnet , and the results are qualitatively the same as those for the [ 100 ] interface .",
    "now we examine the f / s / f trilayer system where s is a chiral @xmath4-wave superconductor .",
    "the spatial variations of the magnetization @xmath27 and the @xmath97-wave scop s are shown in fig.6 .",

    "the direction of the charge current , @xmath113 , is determined by the chirality ( i.e. , ( @xmath117 ) or @xmath118 ) ) , and the currents at the opposite edges of the superconductor should flow in opposite directions .",
    "the direction of the spin current , @xmath114 , is the same as ( opposite to ) that at the other edge of the superconductor if the magnetizations of two ferromagnets are antiparallel ( parallel ) .",
    "then if the chiral superconductor is sandwiched by ferromagnets with antiparallel magnetizations , the total charge current ( integrated over @xmath9 ) should vanish , while the total spin current will be finite . on the contrary",
