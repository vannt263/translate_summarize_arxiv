    "one fascinating property of superconductors is ability to carry dissipationless current . with a transport current",

    "these vortices are driven by the lorentz force exerted by the current and their motion causes voltage and dissipation . in inhomogeneous superconductors ,",
    "the lorentz force can be balanced by the pinning force due to defects .",
    "the strength of pinning thus determines how much dissipationless current the superconductor can carry , which is defined as the critical current .",
    "the random distributed point - like defects where superconductivity are weakened , are important for pinning of vortices.@xcite one may also introduce artificially columnar pinning centers by heavy ion irradiation.@xcite in these cases , the pinning is caused by suppression of superconductivity .    an alternative approach to introduce pinning is to use magnetic moments , which interact strongly with vortex .",
    "such option may be present in magnetic superconductors .",
    "@xcite the magnetic moments can also be introduced artificially in hybrid systems consisting of superconducting and magnetic layers@xcite .",
    "it was proposed in ref . that the domain walls can provide strong pinning with characteristic pinning energy @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the quantum flux and @xmath4 is the magnetization at the wall .",
    "there are experimental attempts to enhance the critical current by putting magnetic particles@xcite , dots@xcite or ferromagnet with domain walls on top of superconductors .",
    "@xcite    reduction of dissipation can be also achieved by enhancement of the vortex viscosity . at a given current @xmath5 ,",
    "the dissipation power for a superconductor without pinning due to quenched disorder is proportional to @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vortex viscosity . in nonmagnetic superconductors ,",
    "@xmath7 is just the standard bardeen - stephen ( bs ) drag coefficient accounting for the dissipation in the normal vortex core",
    ". if one can increase significantly the vortex viscosity , superconductors can carry large current density with low dissipation , despite vortices are not pinned .",
    "it was shown that in magnetic superconductors , motion of vortex lattice excites magnons@xcite .",
    "when the kinematic condition @xmath8 is satisfied , cherenkov radiation of magnon occurs and the vortex viscosity is enhanced due to transferring energy into the magnetic subsystem , where energy is finally dissipated through magnetic damping .",
    "here @xmath9 is the lattice wave vector , @xmath10 is the velocity of vortex lattice and @xmath11 is the magnon spectrum .",
    "when the magnetic damping is weak , magnetic domain walls are created dynamically due to the parametric instability and the viscosity is increased further.@xcite    recently a polaronic mechanism of vortex pinning is proposed in ref . to explain the increase of critical current observed in erni@xmath12b@xmath12c below the incommensurate to commensurate spin density wave ( sdw ) transition at 2.3 k@xcite .",
    "the transition into the commensurate sdw phase leaves 1/20 spins free from molecular field@xcite .",
    "these spins can be easily polarized by vortices .",
    "these spins are ising spins and experience large crystal field splitting@xcite , which results in slow relaxation dynamics@xcite .",

    "the maximal critical current for erni@xmath12b@xmath12c is estimated as @xmath17 at magnetic field @xmath18 t. the polaronic mechanism is also at work in other borocarbides , cuprate and iron - based superconductors with magnetic rear earth ions locating between superconducting layers .",
    "the polaronic mechanism of pinning provides an additional routine to achieve high critical current . to optimize such pinning mechanism",

    "thus the effective critical current of the whole system @xmath103 is proportional to @xmath104 as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) . therefore the thinner of both m and s layers , the higher is the critical current of the system .",
    "let us discuss the possible choice of s and m layers .",
    "the critical current decreases as @xmath105 because the smaller @xmath23 , the more nonuniform is the magnetic field distribution inside the m layers , hence stronger pinning .",
    "thus superconductors with smaller @xmath23 are preferred .",
    "the critical current does not depend on @xmath15 for sufficiently large @xmath15 , while the viscosity in the branch with vortex polaron is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the slow magnetic dynamics can be realized in spin glasses .",
    "their relaxation is described by a broad spectrum of time scale , with average time of the order @xmath106@xcite . for @xmath107 , @xmath108 at @xmath109 t. @xcite",
    "one may enhance @xmath110 by tuning the concentration of magnetic metal in alloys .",

    "@xcite one may also use the recently synthesized cobalt - based and rare - earth - based single chain magnets with @xmath112 at @xmath109 t and @xmath113.@xcite .",
    "next we discuss the effect of quenched disorder . in the presence of quenched disorder ,",
    "the vortex lines adjust themselves to take the advantage of the pinning potential , which destroys the long - range lattice order . below a threshold current ,",
    "vortices remain pinned ( actually they creep between pinning centers due to fluctuations ) . in this region ,",
    "the polaronic mechanism does not play a role . when the current is high enough to depin",
    "the vortices from quenched disorder , vortices start to move and the lattice ordering is enhanced . by formation of polaron with the nonuniformly induced magnetization , the vortex viscosity is enhanced . at a critical velocity ( current ) , the polaron dissociates and the system jumps to the conventional bs branch . pinning due to quenched disorder works in the static region and polaronic pinning works in the dynamic region .",
    "the critical current of the whole system is the sum of these two threshold currents .",
    "note that magnetostriction in combination with quenched disorder enhance the polaronic pinning mechanism .    the m / s multi - layer structure is naturally in some superconducting single crystals , such as @xmath114@xcite and ( re)ba@xmath12cu@xmath115o@xmath116@xcite , where re is the rear earth magnetic ions . in @xmath114",
    "the magnetic moments order ferromagnetically above @xmath66 thus the dominant enhancement of vortex viscosity is due to the radiation of magnons@xcite . for ( re)ba@xmath12cu@xmath115o@xmath116 , magnetic re ions positioned between superconducting layers interact weakly with superconducting electrons and order at very low nel temperatures of the order @xmath117 k. the polaronic mechanism is important above the magnetic ordering temperature , where spins are free .",
    "the london penetration depth of cuprate superconductors is large @xmath118 nm , thus the critical current is reduced significantly compared to that for nb multi - layer structure , because @xmath103 drops as @xmath119 .",
    "another natural realization is the recently discovered iron - based superconductors , such as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 ions ordered antiferromagnetically below @xmath117k.@xcite",
    "to summarize , we have proposed superconductor - magnet multi - layer structure to achieve high critical current density based on the polaronic pinning mechanism .",
    "the critical current is estimated to be @xmath122 at @xmath1 t for an optimal configurations of nb and proper magnet multi - layer structure . in the presence of",
    "quenched disorder , the polaronic pinning starts to work when vortices depin from quenched potential .",
    "thus the total critical current of the system is the sum of depinning current due to quenched disorder and depinning current due to the polaronic mechanism .",
