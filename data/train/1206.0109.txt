    "the cosmological abundance of relativistic and `` dark '' particles as active or sterile neutrinos   or any other light particle ( as axions , for instance ) is usually parameterized in terms of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 , being @xmath1 the standard value for three ( active ) neutrino species .",
    "several recent cosmological data analyses have constrained the value of @xmath0 with increasing accuracy ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) providing a clear evidence for a dark relativistic background at high statistical significance .",
    "the latest measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies at arc - minute angular scales from the south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite , when combined with other cosmological data sets , yield the constraint @xmath2 at @xmath3 confidence level ( cl )  @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , showing evidence for dark radiation ( i.e. @xmath4 ) at more than seven standard deviations , suggesting values higher than those expected in the standard scenario .",
    "this hint , that clearly must be tested by future cmb measurements as those expected , for example , by the planck satellite @xcite , is interesting since an extra relativistic component in the standard three active neutrino model could be explained by a sterile neutrino .",
    "models with one additional @xmath5  ev massive sterile neutrino , i.e. the so - called ( 3 + 1 ) models , were introduced to explain lsnd short baseline antineutrino data  @xcite by means of neutrino oscillations . up to date cosmological constraints on the number of massive sterile neutrino species",
    "have been presented in refs .",
    "however , a larger value for @xmath0 could also arise from different physics , related to axions  @xcite , decay of non - relativistic matter  @xcite , gravity waves  @xcite , extra dimensions  @xcite , dark energy  @xcite or asymmetric dark matter models  @xcite .",
    "the constraints on @xmath0 are also affected by possible interactions of the dark radiation component with the dark matter component , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "information on the dark relativistic background , however , can be obtained not only from its effects on the expansion rate of the universe but also from its clustering properties .",
    "for example , if dark radiation is made of massless neutrinos it should behave as relativistic particles also from the point of view of perturbation theory . following the definition introduced by hu  @xcite",
    ", this means that the dark radiation component should have an effective sound speed @xmath6 and a viscosity parameter @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "these perturbation parameters can be constrained through measurements of the cmb anisotropies since dark radiation is coupled trough gravity with all the remaining components  @xcite .",
    "this clearly opens a new window for testing the dark radiation component , since , for example , a smaller value for @xmath7 could indicate possible non standard interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a value of @xmath7 different from zero , as expected in the standard scenario , has been detected in @xcite and confirmed in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "more recently , a value of the effective sound speed @xmath6 smaller than the standard value of @xmath9 has been claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from this discussion is clear that current cosmological data analyses are sensitive to dark radiation properties and that the latest constraints on these parameters are showing interesting deviations from their expected standard values .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate the impact of non - standard dark radiation properties in the determination of cosmological parameters related to different sectors as dark energy or inflation .    in this paper",
    "we derive bounds from the most recent cosmological data on the dark radiation parameters @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 relaxing the usual assumption of a @xmath10cdm cosmology , analysing the correlations among the clustering parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 and other key cosmological parameters , as the dark energy equation of state or the scalar spectral index .",
    "we also study these correlations in light of future planck and core cmb data",
    ". we shall generate mock cmb data for a cosmology with dark radiation perturbation parameters different from their standard values and then we fit these simulated data via the usual mcmc analysis to an extended non minimal cosmology with standard dark radiation parameters , but varying both the constant and the time varying dark energy equation of state , or the scalar spectral index and its running .",

    "<S> recent cosmological data have provided evidence for a `` dark '' relativistic background at high statistical significance . </S>",
    "<S> parameterized in terms of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath0 , however , the current data seems to indicate a higher value than the one expected in the standard scenario based on three active neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> this dark radiation component can be characterized not only by its abundance but also by its clustering properties , as its effective sound speed and its viscosity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore crucial to study the correlations among the dark radiation properties and key cosmological parameters , as the dark energy equation of state or the running of the scalar spectral index , with current and future cmb data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that dark radiation with viscosity parameters different from their standard values may be misinterpreted as an evolving dark energy component or as a running spectral index in the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations . </S>"
