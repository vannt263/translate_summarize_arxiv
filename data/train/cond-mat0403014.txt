    "there are a number of useful systems consisting of small solid particles dispersed in host fluids . among them , colloidal dispersions are most common to our daily life and are of great importance , particularly in the fields of engineering and biology  @xcite .",
    "colloidal dispersions have been reported to exhibit several unusual phenomena , such as long - range correlations in sedimenting particles  @xcite , long - range anisotropic interactions in liquid crystal colloidal dispersions  @xcite , transient gel formations during phase separations of colloidal suspensions  @xcite , and electro - rheological effects in particle suspensions of nonconductive fluids  @xcite .",
    "since the dynamics of colloidal dispersions are very complicated , it is extremely difficult to investigate their dynamic properties by means of analytical methods alone .",
    "computational approaches are necessary in order to elucidate the true mechanisms of dynamic phenomena in a variety of situations .",
    "colloidal dispersions , however , have a typical multi - scale problem . the molecules comprising host fluids are much smaller and move much faster than colloidal particles . from a computational point of view , performing fully microscopic molecular simulations for this kind of multi - scale system is extremely inefficient .",
    "an alternative , which is generally considered much better than microscopic simulations , is to treat host fluids as coarse - grained continuum media .",
    "several numerical methods have been developed in an effort to simulate colloidal dispersions .",
    "two of the most well known methods are the stokesian dynamics  @xcite and the eulerian ",
    "lagrangian method .",
    "the former is thought to be the most efficient method , capable of treating hydrodynamic interactions properly .",
    "furthermore , it can be implemented as @xmath0 scheme for @xmath1 particles by utilizing the fast multipole method  @xcite .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to deal with dense dispersions and dispersions consisting of non - spherical particles by means of stokesian dynamics due to the complicated mathematical structures used in stokesian dynamics . on the other hand , the eulerian ",
    "lagrangian method is a very natural and sensible approach to simulate solid particles with arbitrary shapes .",
    "a number of kinds of tailor - made mesh , including unstructured mesh , overset mesh , and boundary - fitted coordinates , have been applied to specific problems , so that the shapes of the particles are properly expressed in the discrete mesh - space .",
    "thus , in principle it is possible to apply this method to dispersions consisting of many particles with any shape .",
    "however , a numerical inefficiency arises from the following : i ) re - constructions of the irregular mesh are necessary at every simulation step according to the temporal particle position , and ii ) the navier  stokes equation must be solved with boundary conditions imposed on the surfaces of all colloidal particles .",
    "the computational demands thus are enormous for systems involving many particles , even if the shapes are all spherical .",
    "thus , our goal is to develop an efficient simulation method that can be applied to particle dispersions in complex fluids .",
    "since host fluids are considered incompressible in such systems , an efficient simulation must address how to efficiently and accurately evaluate hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "as a first step towards this goal , we attempted to develop a method to simulate colloidal dispersions in simple newtonian fluids .",
    "the reliability of this method was tested by calculating the drag force acting on a cylindrical object in a flow .",
    "its performance was subsequently demonstrated by simulating the sedimentation processes of colloidal particles in a newtonian fluid within a small reynolds number regime .",
    "in order to overcome the problems arising at the solid - fluid interface in the eulerian  lagrangian method , rather than the original discontinuous rectangle profile ( interfacial thickness , @xmath2 ) schematically depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : profile ] , a smoothed profile was introduced to the interface ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this simple modification greatly benefits the performance of numerical computations , compared to the original eulerian ",
    "lagrangian method for the following reasons .",
    "\\i ) regular cartesian coordinates can be used for many particle systems with any particle shape , rather than boundary - fitted coordinates .",
    "the solid - fluid interface has a finite volume ( @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the particle radius and system dimension ) supported by multiple grid points .",
    "thus , the round particle shape can be treated in fixed cartesian coordinates without difficulty .",
    "the simulation scheme is thus free from the mesh re - construction problem that significantly suppresses the computational efficiency of the eulerian  lagrangian method . in addition , the simple cartesian coordinate enables use of the periodic boundary conditions as well as the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) .",
    "\\ii ) at the interfaces , the velocity component in the direction normal to the interface of the host fluid must be equal to that of the particle .",
    "this kinetic condition is imposed in the navier  stokes equation , as the boundary value condition defined for the solid - fluid interface in typical methods . in our method , however , this condition is automatically satisfied by an incompressibility condition on the entire domain , which will be subsequently explained in detail .",
    "\\iii ) the computational demands for this method include sensitivity to the number of grid points ( volume of the total system ) , however it is insensitive to the number of particles .",
    "thus , our method is thought to be suitable for simulating dense colloidal dispersions .",
    "the non - zero interfacial thickness @xmath7 is the only approximation used in the present method .",
    "thus , inter - particle hydrodynamic interactions can be fully resolved within the approximation of the non - zero thickness in the present method .",
    "there have been two similar methods developed by different authors  @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas of these methods is to use a fixed grid and represent the particles not as boundary conditions to the fluid , but by a body force or lagrange multipliers in navier  stokes equation .",
    "the essential difference in our approach to these two methods is to introduce a explicit diffuse interface in a smoothed profile .",
    "as long as a fixed grid is used , the moving boundary is inevitably represented as diffuse as grid spacing .",
    "the introduction of a explicit smoothed profile makes us to present a clear formulation of a numerical algorithm and is advantagous when it is applied to complex fluids  @xcite    the lattice boltzmann  ( lb ) method  @xcite has attracted much attention in recent years to simulate colloidal dispersions with hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite .",
    "the lb equation was proved to offer a faithful discretization of navier  stokes equation , and colloidal dispersions are simulated in the eulerian  lagrangian manner . in practical viewpoints ,",
    "the lb method is forumlated on a fixed cartesian lattice and is well adapted to parallel computation .",
    "the lb approach , although the formulation is not intuitive and its treatment of moving solid - fluid boundary is somewhat complicated , has several similar merits to the present method .",
    "the `` fluid particle dynamics ''  ( fpd ) method was proposed earlier and is similar to our method in spirit  @xcite . in this method , although a similar smoothed profile was adopted , there are several important differences between fpd and the present method .",
    "the most significant difference is that particles are modeled as a highly viscous fluid with viscosity @xmath8 , much greater than the fluid viscosity @xmath9 in fpd .",
    "this enables the rigidity of the particles to be sustained approximately by artificial diffusivity @xmath10  ( @xmath11 ) within the particle domain .",
    "while this model is physically correct , a practical problem remains in that a larger viscosity requires smaller time increments .",
    "in contrast , the present method treats colloidal particles as undeformable solids , ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath12 ) thus no additional constraint arises in the numerical implementations .",
    "colloidal dispersions are considered in a simple newtonian liquid .",
    "the motion of the host fluid is governed by the navier  stokes equation with the incompressibility condition , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fluid velocity , @xmath15 is the fluid density .",
    "the stress tensor is represented by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pressure , @xmath18 is the fluid viscosity .",
    "the colloidal particles are assumed to be rigid and spherical , and their positions @xmath19 are tracked in a lagrangian reference frame , @xmath20 with the translational momentum equation @xmath21 and the angler momentum equation @xmath22 where @xmath19 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the position , the translational velocity , the angular velocity , the mass , and the inertia tensor of the @xmath27th particle , respectively .",
    "the hydrodynamic force @xmath28 and torque @xmath29 acting on a particle can be obtained by integrating the stress tensor over the surface as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the relative position vector from the center of rotation to the colloid surface .",
    "furthermore , @xmath32 is the force due to direct particle - particle interactions , and @xmath33 is the buoyant force where @xmath34 is the mass density ratio of the particles to the host fluid , and @xmath35 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "relevant dimensionless parameters in the above equations include the reynolds number @xmath36 , the froude number @xmath37 , the mass density ratio @xmath38 , and the volume fraction @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 represent typical velocity and length scales specific to the systems under consideration , respectively .",
    "the kinematic viscosity @xmath42 and the mass density of colloidal particles @xmath43 are assumed to be constant .    in typical methods ,",
    "the above set of equations should be solved using proper boundary conditions defined at the solid - fluid interface . in the present method , however , the solid - fluid boundary condition is replaced with a body force and an incompressibility condition on a total velocity defined on the entire domain .",
    "assuming a smoothed profile with a finite thickness @xmath7 to the solid - fluid interface , we here derive the body force which accurately takes the interactions between solids and fluids due to the motions of colloids in an incompressible fluid into consideration .",
    "the present study considers a mono - disperse system consisting of @xmath44 spherical particles with radius @xmath5 .",
    "the positions of the particles @xmath45 are first transformed to a continuous field @xmath46 using the @xmath27th particle s profile function @xmath47 centered at @xmath48 .",
    "several possible mathematical forms for @xmath47 exist , however , some typical functions are listed in appendix  [ appendix : smooth_profile ] .",
    "the continuum velocity field @xmath49 is defined for the solid particles using @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 as @xmath53 the total ( fluid+particle ) velocity field is then given by @xmath54 since the particle velocity field @xmath49 is constructed from the rigid motions of particles , @xmath55 is verified as @xmath56 assuming the incompressibility of the fluid velocity @xmath14 , the divergence of the total velocity is @xmath57 the gradient of @xmath58 is proportional to the surface - normal vector and have a support on the interfacial domains . therefore , the incompressibility condition on the total velocity @xmath59 means the solid - fluid impermeability condition at the solid - fluid interface .",
    "we are to derive the evolution of the total velocity @xmath60 . to make the points clearer , we first consider the problem assuming that the motions of particles @xmath61 are given . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_u ] ) , only the fluid velocity @xmath14 is to be solved .",
    "the evolution equation of the total velocity is splitted as @xmath62 where the stress tensor is @xmath63 by integrating eqs  ( [ eq : predict_u ] ) with ( [ eq : stress ] ) , the total velocity is predicted as @xmath64 .",
    "the pressure @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stress ] ) is determined to fulfill the incompressibility condition @xmath66 .",
    "then , the body force @xmath67 is added to enforce eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_u ] ) and solid - fluid inpermeability condition .",
    "therefore , the time - integrated body force @xmath67 is determined as @xmath68 where the pressure @xmath69 is determined to fulfill @xmath70 . by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp ] ) with the body force , eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_fp ] ) , we finally make eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_u ] ) where the fluid velocity is @xmath71 we note that the non - slip condition at the solid - fluid interface is fulfilled in this time evolution of the total velocity .",
    "since the viscous stress  ( [ eq : stress ] ) acts on the entire domain including the interfacial domain , the tangential velocity difference between @xmath14 and @xmath49 is reduced . in other words ,",
    "non - slip or slip condition can be imposed in the definition of the stress @xmath72 used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : predict_u ] ) .",
    "when compared to fpd  @xcite , their body force is @xmath73 with the artificial diffusivity @xmath74 . in the limit of @xmath75 ,",
    "the particle becomes rigid , however this limit can not be achieved by the numerical scheme used in fpd .",
    "in contrast to fpd , the body force @xmath67 guarantees the rigidity of the solid particle without additional large artificial diffusivity .",
    "we complete the time evolution by deriving the hydrodynamic force @xmath76 acting on the particles .",
    "the hydrodynamic force is defined as the momentum flux between the fluid and solid .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic force is simply the counteraction from the fluid , @xmath77 in contrast to the force in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hydro_force0 ] ) which is expressed as the surface integral , the above force is given as the volume integral .",
    "the volume integral is much advantageous in mesh - based discretization compared to the surface integral since no generation of body - fitted mesh is needed .",
    "\\i ) for a given particle configuration @xmath78 , velocity @xmath79 , and angular momentum @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , where the superscript @xmath82 denotes the time step and @xmath83 is the time increment , the fluid velocity at a time @xmath84 is predicted as @xmath85 under the incompressibility condition @xmath86 which determines the intermediate pressure @xmath65 .",
    "\\ii ) at step @xmath82 , the total velocity @xmath87 should be equal to @xmath49 within the particle domain and the surface - normal velocity components of particles and fluid should be match in the interfacial domain .",
    "thus , it must be corrected by the body force @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 the correcting pressure @xmath69 is determined to make a resultant total velocity incompressible .",
    "this leads to the poisson equation of @xmath69 , @xmath90 finally , we have @xmath91    \\iii ) the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on each colloidal particle are now computed using the volume integrals , @xmath92 and the velocity , angular velocity , and position of each colloidal particles at the current step @xmath82 are updated to @xmath93 as @xmath94 since the same @xmath67 is used for both the host fluid ( [ eq : host_fluid ] ) and the colloidal particles ( [ eq : hydro_force ] ) , ( [ eq : hydro_torque ] ) through the interface , no excess or shorts for solid - fluid interactions exist .",
    "the same type of solid - fluid interaction has been previously proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the treatment used in the present method is more general .",
    "it is important to note that the timing of the updates for fluid ( [ eq : host_fluid_intermediate ] ) and particles ( [ eq : vi])-([eq : ri ] ) has been shifted ; the particles always go one step ahead of the fluid .",
    "this shift is primarily due to a technical issue related to the solid - fluid boundary condition . in general , the boundary value conditions , which is replaced with the force due to solid - fluid interactions in the present method , is necessary to update the fluid .",
    "otherwise , in order to update both the fluid and the particles simultaneously , the implicit scheme for particles must be used . consider the problem to integrate the @xmath95th step variables , @xmath96 with @xmath97 , to @xmath82th step .",
    "the particle velocity of next step , @xmath98 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_fp ] ) is needed to update the total velocity @xmath97 to @xmath87 before @xmath96 is updated .",
    "this situation requires the implicit treatment .",
    "the use of the implicit scheme complicates the algorithm and reduces the efficiency .",
    "the timing - shift is therefore necessary to realize the full explicit scheme described above .",
    "the initial condition , @xmath99 with @xmath97 , can be generically constructed . from the total velocity @xmath97 satisfying the initial boundary condition given by @xmath100 , the hydrodynamic force and torque is computed as surface integrals and the particle trajectory is integrated from @xmath95th to @xmath82th step .",
    "together with the construction of the initial condition , the timing - shift algorithm is realized without loss of generality .    in the above formulation , although the solid - fluid interaction force  ( [ eq : def_fp ] ) was computed on the basis of the euler scheme for simplicity of presentation , implementations of higher order schemes are straightforward for eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vi])-([eq : ri ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to update the host fluid in eq .",
    "( [ eq : host_fluid_intermediate ] ) , no restrictions exist for the time discretization and any conventional scheme can be used for incompressible fluids .",
    "the present method has been applied to two specific problems : the calculation of the drag force acting on an infinitely long cylindrical rod moving in a newtonian fluid in order to check the validity .",
    "the method was also applied to simulations of many sedimenting particles in a two dimensional fluid in order to demonstrate the performance . in the present simulations",
    ", the navier  stokes equation was discretized with a de - aliased fourier spectral scheme in space and a second order runge  kutta scheme ( the heun scheme ) in time .",
    "for the colloidal particles , the velocity and the angular velocity were integrated with the heun scheme , and the position was integrated with the crank  nicolson scheme .",
    "the external boundary condition on the edge of the systems was imposed in the same manner as the fluid - solid boundary condition on the particle surface .",
    "the simulation code is remarkably simple due to such unified treatment for all boundary conditions .",
    "the drag force acting on an infinitely long cylindrical rod with radius @xmath5 was computed by solving the navier  stokes equation around the rod in order to check the accuracy of the present method .",

    "an uniform stream @xmath40 in @xmath103-direction was assigned to the edge of the domain as the boundary condition . here",
    "the reynolds number was defined by @xmath104 .",

    "the performance of the present method was examined by simulating sedimentation processes of mono - disperse particles in a two dimensional newtonian fluid in a rectangular box surrounded by non - slip walls with @xmath129 and @xmath130 the dimensionless parameters were taken to be @xmath131 , @xmath132 , where the settling velocity and the diameter of particle were taken as the characteristic velocity and length .",
    "other computational parameters were chosen as @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , where @xmath138-axis is in the direction of gravity . in order to prevent the particles from overlapping within the core radius @xmath139 , the force was added @xmath140 due to direct particle - particle interaction using the repulsive part of the lennard - jones potential @xmath141\\theta(2^{7/6}a - r_{ij } ) , $ ] where @xmath142 is the step function and @xmath143 .",
    "the direct interaction @xmath144 is not very important when the particles are moving around because the particles never overlap due to the lubrication effect , even without @xmath144 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lub ] shows the lubrication force acting on two approaching rods computed using the present method .",
    "the lubrication force is always repulsive in this case , and thus prevents the rods from approaching each other .",
    "the strength of the repulsion increases with increasing velocity @xmath40 .    , ranging from @xmath145 to @xmath146 by @xmath147 , which almost collapsed .",

    ". in this simulation ,",
    "swirls were still developed , however they were smaller than those observed with non - slip walls .",
    "the effect of confinement in the non - slip walls therefore enhances the velocity correlation .",
    "the computational demand required for the present simulation is less than one day of processing on a normal pc .",

    "another primary benefit of using the smoothed profile arose when the method was extended to colloidal dispersions in complex fluids with an internal degree of freedom , such as the molecular orientation or ionic density .",
    "in complex fluids , inter - particle interactions can be mediated by the internal degree of freedom of the fluid . in such cases , the fluid - particle interactions at the colloid surface",
