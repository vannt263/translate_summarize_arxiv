    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is a protocol that allows two distant parties to share a secret without meeting and in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper @xcite .",
    "the security of the protocol is based on the validity of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "quantum key distribution protocols broadly fall under two main categories , viz .",
    "the product - state and the entanglement based ones , the bennett - brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) @xcite and the ekert 1991 @xcite protocols being prominent examples of the respective categories .",
    "it was later realized that the two categories are similar from several perspectives @xcite , with a notable difference being in the device independent security proof @xcite , which is based on the ekert protocol with security obtained via violation of bell inequality @xcite .",
    "we may note that in the two - qubit scenario , strong violation of bell inequality is possible only by states close to maximally entangled states , and such states are almost pure @xcite .",
    "an almost pure state shared between the legitimate users of the key distribution channel implies that these users are informationally detached from the rest of the world , including a possible eavesdropper , indicating the security of the information flowing in the channel between the legitimate users .    in this work",
    ", we ask whether we can start a step later to obtain a security proof of quantum cryptography for individual attacks via a variation @xcite of the ekert key distribution protocol . precisely , we consider states with high purity and that also has correlations which allow generation of correlated bit sequences .",
    "we consider a scenario with three parties called alice , bob , and eve , where alice and bob represent the legitimate users of the protocol , while eve represents the potential eavesdropper .",
    "we prove complementarity relations between the purity of the alice - bob system and the quantum mutual information in the alice - bob versus eve bipartition .",
    "we then show that such a complementarity can potentially lead to a bound on the secret key rate in the case of individual attacks .",
    "this secret key rate is obtained by concepts independent of bell inequalities , which , along with providing another perspective of the security of the ekert protocol , can also be important to avoid vulnerability of the proof from loopholes in experiments that violate bell inequalities @xcite ( cf .",
    "note that the complementarity relation is true for any quantum state of arbitrary dimensions of the individual parties , and is also true for an arbitrary number of parties , and so can have applications in other quantum information protocols with or without security .",
    "on the way , we also show that a similar complementarity exists in all multiparty quantum systems between the purity of the `` legitimate '' users , and a large number of quantum characteristics including quantum correlations in the legitimate versus `` eavesdroppers '' bipartition , irrespective of whether the multipartite quantum state is pure or mixed and irrespective of the dimensions of the subsystems and the number of parties involved .",
    "we also numerically investigate the tightness of the obtained inequalities by haar uniformly generating states of three qubits of different ranks .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", we derive the complementarity relations .",
    "their tightness is considered in the sec .",

    "a concluding section is presented at the end .",
    "we now derive the complementarity relations for arbitrary multiparty quantum states .",
    "the parties involved are divided into `` legitimate '' users and `` eavesdroppers '' .",
    "the relations show a trade - off between two quantities , one of which is the purity of the state of the legitimate users , while the other is a quantum characteristic in the legitimate users versus eavesdroppers bipartition .",
    "to be specific , we begin with the three party case , where there are two legitimate users and a single eavesdropper .",
    "we will briefly mention the case of an arbitrary number of parties later .",

    "if quantum discord is defined by considering the measurement in its definition to be in the first party , then its value for an arbitrary quantum state in @xmath7 can be shown to be bounded above by @xmath30 @xcite , so that the complementarity relation ( [ eq : qcr - ent1 ] ) is valid for the measure . henceforth , we consider that the quantum discord is defined by performing the measurement in the second party .",
