    "quantum mechanics was originally introduced as a non commutative matrix calculus of observables by werner heisenberg ( heisenberg 1925 ) and parallel as a wave mechanics by erwin schrdinger ( schrdinger 1926 ) .",
    "both structurally very different theories , matrix mechanics and wave mechanics could explain fruitfully the early observed quantum phenomena .",
    "already in the same year the two theories were shown to be realizations of the same , more abstract , ket - bra formalism by dirac ( dirac 1958 ) .",
    "only some years later , in 1934 , john von neumann put forward a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum theory in an infinite dimensional separable complex hilbert space ( von neumann 1955 ) .",
    "matrix mechanics and wave mechanics appear as concrete realizations : the first one if the hilbert space is @xmath1 , the collection of all square summable complex numbers , and the second one if the hilbert space is @xmath2 , the collection of all square integrable complex functions .",
    "the formulation of quantum mechanics in the abstract framework of a complex hilbert space is now usually referred to as the ` standard quantum mechanics ' .",
    "the basic concepts - the vectors of the hilbert space representing the states of the system and the self - adjoint operators representing the observables - in this standard quantum mechanics are abstract mathematical concepts defined mathematically in and abstract mathematical space , and this is a problem for the physicists working to understand quantum mechanics .",
    "several approaches have generalized the standard theory starting from more physically defined basic concepts .",
    "john von neumann and garett birkhoff have initiated one of these approaches ( birkhoff and von neumann 1936 ) were they analyze the difference between quantum and classical theories by studying the ` experimental propositions '",
    ". they could show that for a given physical system classical theories have a boolean lattice of experimental propositions while for quantum theory the lattice of experimental propositions is not boolean .",
    "similar fundamental structural differences between the two theories have been investigated by concentrating on different basic concepts .",
    "the collection of observables of a classical theory was shown to be a commutative algebra while this is now the case for the collection of quantum observables ( segal 1947 , emch 1984 ) .",
    "luigi accardi and itamar pitowski obtained a analogous result by concentrating on the probability models connected to the two theories : classical theories have a kolmogorovian probability model while the probability model of a quantum theory is non kolmogorovian ( accardi 1982 , pitowski 1989 ) .",
    "the fundamental structural differences between the two types of theories , quantum and classical , in different categories , was interpreted as indicating also a fundamental difference on the level of the nature of the reality that both theories describe : the micro world should be ` very different ' from the macro world .",
    "the author admits that he was himself very much convinced of this state of affairs also because very concrete attempts to understand quantum mechanics in a classical way had failed as well : e.g. the many ` physical ' hidden variable theories that had been tried out ( selleri 1990 ) . in this paper",
    "we want to concentrate on this problem : in which way the quantum world is different from the classical world .",
    "we shall do this in the light of the approach that we have been elaborating in brussels and that we have called the ` hidden measurement formalism ' .",
    "we concentrate also on the different paradoxes in quantum mechanics : the measurement problem , the schrdinger cat paradox , the classical limit , the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox and the problem of non - locality .",
    "we investigate which ones of these quantum problems are due to shortcomings of the standard formalism and which ones point out real physical differences between the quantum and classical world .",
    "as we mentioned already in the foregoing section , the structural difference between quantum theories and classical theories ( boolean lattice versus non - boolean lattice of propositions , commutative algebra versus non commutative algebra of observables and kolmogorovian versus non kolmogorovian probability structure ) is one of the most convincing elements for the belief in a deep difference between the quantum world and the classical world . during all the years that these structural differences have been investigated ( mostly mathematically ) these",
    "has not been much understanding of the physical meaning of these structural differences .",
    "in which way would these structural differences be linked to some more intuitive but physically better understood differences between quantum theory and classical theory ?    within the hidden measurement approach",
    "we have been able to identify the physical aspects that are at the origin of the structural differences between quantum and classical theories .",
    "this are two aspects that both characterize the nature of the measurements that have to be carried out to test the properties of the system under study .",
    "let us formulate these two aspects carefully first .",
    "_ we have a quantum - like theory describing a system under investigation if the measurements needed to test the properties of the system are such that : _    ( 1 ) : :    _ the measurements are not just observations but provoke a real change    of the state of the system _ ( 2 ) : :    _ there exists a lack of knowledge about the reality of what happens    during the measurement process _    it is the lack of knowledge * ( 2 ) * that is theoretically structured in a non kolmogorovian probability model.in a certain sense it is possible to interpret the second aspect , the presence of the lack of knowledge on the reality of the measurement process , as the presence of ` hidden measurements ' instead of ` hidden variables ' . indeed ,",
    "if a measurement is performed with the presence of such a lack of knowledge , then this is actually the classical mixture of a set of classical hidden measurements , were for such a classical hidden measurement there would be no lack of knowledge . in an analogous way as in a hidden variable theory ,",
    "the quantum state is a classical mixture of classical states .",
    "this is the reason why we have called the formalism that we are elaborating in brussels and that consists in formalizing in a mathematical theory the physical situations containing the two mentioned aspects , the ` hidden measurement formalism ' .",
    "after we had identified the two aspects * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * it was not difficult to invent a quantum machine fabricated only with macroscopic materials and producing a quantum structure isomorphic to the structure of a two dimensional complex hilbert space , describing for example the spin of a quantum particle with spin @xmath3 ( aerts 1985 , 1986 , 1987 ) . this quantum machine has been presented in different occasions meanwhile ( aerts 1988a , b , 1991a , 1995 ) and therefore we shall only , for the sake of completeness , introduce it shortly here .",
    "the machine that we consider consists of a physical entity @xmath4 that is a point particle @xmath5 that can move on the surface of a sphere , denoted @xmath6 , with center @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 .",
    "the unit - vector @xmath9 where the particle is located on @xmath6 represents the state @xmath10 of the particle ( see fig .",
    "for each point @xmath11 , we introduce the following measurement @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the diametrically opposite point @xmath13 , and install a piece of elastic of length 2 , such that it is fixed with one of its end - points in @xmath14 and the other end - point in @xmath13 .",

    "then the elastic breaks and the particle @xmath5 , attached to one of the two pieces of the elastic ( fig 1,c ) , moves to one of the two end - points @xmath14 or @xmath13 ( fig 1,d ) . depending on whether the particle @xmath5 arrives in @xmath14 ( as in fig 1 ) or in @xmath13",
    ", we give the outcome @xmath23 or @xmath24 to @xmath12 .",
    "we can easily calculate the probabilities corresponding to the two possible outcomes .",

    "we make the hypothesis that the elastic breaks uniformly , which means that the probability that the particle , being in state @xmath10 , arrives in @xmath14 , is given by the length of @xmath25 divided by the length of the total elastic ( which is 2 ) .",
    "the probability that the particle in state @xmath10 arrives in @xmath13 is the length of @xmath27 ( which is @xmath29 ) divided by the length of the total elastic .",
    "if we denote these probabilities respectively by @xmath30 and @xmath31 we have : @xmath32    these transition probabilities are the same as the ones related to the outcomes of a stern - gerlach spin measurement on a spin @xmath3 quantum particle , of which the quantum - spin - state in direction @xmath33 @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath35 , and the measurement @xmath12 corresponding to the spin measurement in direction @xmath36 @xmath37 , is described respectively by the vector and the self adjoint operator of a two - dimensional complex hilbert space .",
    "@xmath38 we can easily see now the two aspects in this quantum machine that we have identified in the hidden measurement approach to give rise to the quantum structure .",
    "the state of the particle @xmath5 is effectively changed by the measuring apparatus ( @xmath10 changes to @xmath39 or to @xmath40 under the influence of the measuring process ) , which identifies the first aspect , and there is a lack of knowledge on the interaction between the measuring apparatus and the particle , namely the lack of knowledge of were exactly the elastic will break , which identifies the second aspect .",
    "we can also easily understand now what is meant by the term ` hidden measurements ' .",
    "each time the elastic breaks in one specific point @xmath41 , we could identify the measurement process that is carried out afterwards as a hidden measurement @xmath42 .",
    "the measurement @xmath12 is then a classical mixture of the collection of all measurement @xmath42 : namely @xmath12 consists of choosing at random one of the @xmath42 and performing this chosen @xmath42 .",
    "first of all we remark that we have shown in our group in brussels that such a hidden measurement model can be built for any arbitrary quantum entity ( aerts 1985 , 1986 , 1987 , coecke 1995a , b , c ) . however , the hidden measurement formalism is more general than standard quantum theory .",
    "indeed , it is very easy to produce quantum - like structures that can not be represented in a complex hilbert space ( aerts 1986 ) .    if the quantum structure can be explained by the presence of a lack of knowledge on the measurement process , we can go a step further , and wonder what types of structure arise when we consider the original models , with a lack of knowledge on the measurement process , and introduce a variation of the magnitude of this lack of knowledge .",
    "we have studied the quantum machine under varying ` lack of knowledge ' , parameterizing this variation by a number @xmath43 $ ] , such that @xmath44 corresponds to the situation of maximal lack of knowledge , giving rise to a quantum structure , and @xmath45 corresponds to the situation of zero lack of knowledge , generating a classical structure .",
    "other values of @xmath0 correspond to intermediate situations and give rise to a structure that is neither quantum nor classical ( aerts durt van bogaert 1992 , 1993 and aerts durt 1994 a , b ) .",
    "we have called this model the @xmath0-model and want to introduce it again in this paper to explain in which way some of the quantum paradoxes are solved in the hidden measurement formalism .    _",
    "a ) the @xmath0-model _",
    "we start from the quantum machine , but introduce now different types of elastic .",
    "an @xmath46-elastic consists of three different parts : one lower part where it is unbreakable , a middle part where it breaks uniformly , and an upper part where it is again unbreakable . by means of the two parameters",
    "@xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] , we fix the sizes of the three parts in the following way .",
    "suppose that we have installed the @xmath46-elastic between the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the sphere .",
    "then the elastic is unbreakable in the lower part from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , it breaks uniformly in the part from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and it is again unbreakable in the upper part from @xmath52 to @xmath14 ( see fig .",

    "we have the following cases : _ ( 1 ) _ @xmath57 .",
    "the particle sticks to the lower part of the @xmath58-elastic , and any breaking of the elastic pulls it down to the point @xmath13 .",
    "we have @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    _ ( 2 ) _ @xmath61 .",
    "the particle falls onto the breakable part of the @xmath46-elastic .",
    "we can easily calculate the transition probabilities and find : @xmath62 _ ( 3 ) _",
    "the particle falls onto the upper part of the @xmath64-elastic , and any breaking of the elastic pulls it upwards , such that it arrives in @xmath14 .",
    "we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we are now in a very interesting situation from the point of view of the structural studies of quantum mechanics .",
    "since the @xmath0-model describes a continuous transition from quantum to classical , its mathematical structure should be able to learn us _",
    "what are the structural shortcomings of the standard hilbert space quantum mechanics_. therefore we have studied the @xmath0-model in the existing mathematical approaches that are more general than the standard quantum mechanics : the lattice approach , the probabilistic approach and the * -algebra approach .    _",
    "b ) the lattice approach _    in this lattice approach exists a well known axiomatic scheme that reduces the approach to standard quantum mechanics if certain axioms are fulfilled . for intermediate values of @xmath0 ,",
    "that is @xmath67 , we find that 2 of the 5 axioms needed in the lattice approach to reconstruct standard quantum mechanics are violated .",
    "the axioms that are violated are the weak - modularity and the covering law , and it are precisely those axioms that are needed to recover the vector space structure of the state space in quantum mechanics ( aerts durt van bogaert 1993 and aerts durt 1994 a , b ) .    _ c ) the probabilistic approach _    if we take the case of vanishing fluctuations ( @xmath45 ) , do we obtain the kolmogorovian theory of probability ?",
    "this would be most interesting , since then we would have constructed a macroscopic model with an understandable structure ( i.e. , we can see how the probabilities arise ) and a quantum and a classical behavior . we ( aerts 1995 ) proposed to test the polytopes for a family of conditional probabilities .",
    "the calculations can be found in ( aerts s. 1995 ) and the result was what we hoped for : a macroscopic model with a quantum and a kolmogorovian limit . for intermediate values of the fluctuations ( @xmath67 )",
    "the resulting probability model is neither quantum nor kolmogorovian : we have identified here a new type of probability model , that is quantum - like , but not really isomorphic to the probability model found in a complex hilbert space .    _",
    "d ) the * -algebra approach _    the * -algebra provides a natural mathematical language for quantum mechanical operators .",
    "we applied the concepts of this approach to the epsilon model to find that an operator corresponding to an @xmath0 measurement is linear if and only if @xmath44 ( aerts dhooghe 1996 ) .",
    "this means that for the classical and intermediate situations the observables can not be described by linear operators .",
    "* conclusion : * _ quantum theory and classical theories appear as special cases ( @xmath68 ) and the general intermediate case , although quantum - like , can not be described in standard hilbert space quantum mechanics .",
    "_    _ e ) the measurement problem and the schrdingers cat paradox _",
    "the result stated in the conclusion means that all the paradoxes of standard quantum theory that are due to the fact that quantum theory is used as a universal theory , also being applied to macroscopic system , for example the measuring apparatus , are not present in our hidden measurement formalism .",
    "we explicitly have in mind the ` measurement problem ' and the ` schrdinger cat paradox ' .",
    "indeed , the measurement apparatus should be described by a classical model in our approach , and the physical system eventually by a quantum model .",
    "the problem of the presence of quantum correlations between physical system and measuring apparatus , as it presents itself in the standard theory , takes a completely different aspect .",
    "we are working now at the elaboration of a concrete description of the measurement process within the hidden measurement formalism ( aerts durt 1994b ) .",
    "our result also shows that it is possible in the hidden measurement formalism to formulate a ` classical limit ' , namely as a continuous transition from quantum to classical ( aerts durt van bogaert 1993 ) .",
    "the measurement problem and paradoxes equivalent to schrdingers cat paradox disappear in the hidden measurement formalism , because standard quantum mechanics appears only as a special case , the situation of maximum fluctuations .",
    "all quantum mysteries connected to the effect of ` non - locality ' remain ( einstein podolsky rosen paradox and the violation of the bell inequalities ) .",
    "it is even so that non - locality unfolds itself as a fundamental aspect of the hidden measurement approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that if we explain the quantum structures as it is done in the hidden measurement formalism a quantum measurement has two concrete physical effects : ( 1 ) it changes the state of the system and ( 2 ) it produces probability due to a lack of knowledge about the nature of this change . with the quantum machine",
    "we have given a macroscopic model for a spin measurement of a spin @xmath69 particle .",
    "if we apply the hidden measurement formalism to the situation of a quantum system described by a wave function @xmath70 , and to a position or a momentum measurement performed on this system , we also have the two mentioned effects .",
    "for example in the case of a position measurement : the detection apparatus changes the state of the quantum system , in the sense that it ` localizes ' the quantum system in a specific place of space , and the probabilities that are connected with this measurement are due to the fact that we lack knowledge about the specific way in which this localization takes place .",
    "this means that ` before the detection has taken place ' the quantum system was in general not localized : it was not present in a specific region of space . with other words ,",
    "quantum systems are fundamentally non - local systems : the wave function @xmath70 describing such a quantum state is not interpreted as a wave that is present in space , but as indicating these regions of space were the particle can be localized , where @xmath71 is the probability that this localization will happen in region @xmath72 .",
    "a similar interpretation must be given to the momentum measurement of a quantum entity : the quantum entity has no momentum before the measurement , but the measurement creates partly this momentum . in ( aerts durt van bogaert 1993 )",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0-situation for a quantum system described by a wave function @xmath70 , element of the hilbert space of all square integrable complex functions , and we have found the following very simple procedure",

    "if @xmath88 has two maxima ( one behind slit 1 , and the other behind slit 2 ) that are equal , the non - locality does not disappear .",
    "indeed , in this case the limit - function is the sum of two delta - functions ( one behind slit 1 and one behind slit 2 ) .",
    "so in this case the non - locality remains present even in the classical limit .",
    "if our procedure for the classical limit is a correct one , also macroscopic classical entities can be in non - local states .",
    "how does it come that we do nt find any sign of this non - locality in the classical macroscopic world ?",
    "this is due to the fact that the set of states , representing a situation where the probability function has more than one maximum , has measure zero , compared to the set of all possible states , and moreover these states are ` unstable ' .",
    "the slightest perturbation will destroy the symmetry of the different maxima , and hence shall give rise to one point of localization in the classical limit .",
    "also classical macroscopic reality is non - local , but the local model that we use to describe it gives the same statistical results , and hence can not be distinguished from the non - local model .",
    "it is interesting to consider the violation of bell s inequalities within the hidden - measurement formalism .",
    "the quantum machine , as presented in section 3 , delivers us a macroscopic model for the spin of a spin @xmath3 quantum entity and starting with this model it is possible to construct a macroscopic situation , using two of these models coupled by a rigid rod , that represents faithfully the situations of two entangled quantum particles of spin @xmath3 ( aerts 1991b ) .",
    "the ` non - local ' element is introduced explicitly by means of a rod that connects the two sphere - models .",
    "we also have studied this epr situation of entangled quantum systems by introducing the @xmath0-variation of the amount of lack of knowledge on the measurement processes and could show that one violates the bell - inequalities even more for classical but non - locally connected systems , that is , @xmath90 .",
    "this illustrates that the violation of the bell - inequalities is due to the non - locality rather then to the indeterministic character of quantum theory . and that the quantum indeterminism ( for values of @xmath0 greater than 0 ) tempers the violation of the bell inequalities ( aerts d. , aerts s. , coecke and valckenborgh 1996 , aerts , coecke , durt and valckenborgh , 1997a , b )",

    "<S> in the hidden measurement formalism that we develop in brussels we explain the quantum structure as due to the presence of two effects , ( a ) a real change of state of the system under influence of the measurement and , ( b ) a lack of knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement process . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the presence of these two effects leads to the major part of the quantum mechanical structure of a theory describing a physical system where the measurements to test the properties of this physical system contain the two mentioned effects . </S>",
    "<S> we present a quantum machine , where we can illustrate in a simple way how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two effects . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a parameter @xmath0 that measures the amount of the lack of knowledge on the measurement process , and by varying this parameter , we describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure ( maximal lack of knowledge ) to a classical structure ( zero lack of knowledge ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for intermediate values of @xmath0 we find a new type of structure that is neither quantum nor classical . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the quantum paradoxes in the light of these findings and show that they can be divided into two groups : ( 1 ) the group ( measurement problem and schrdingers cat paradox ) where the paradoxical aspects arise mainly from the application of standard quantum theory as a general theory ( e.g. also describing the measurement apparatus ) . </S>",
