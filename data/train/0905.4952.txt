    "the existence of non - baryonic dark matter is supported by many astronomical and cosmological observations such as rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing , cluster dynamics , large scale structure surveys and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of dark matter remains elusive after decades of research - we only know that dark matter does not participate in the electromagnetic or strong interactions and that it has behaved as a non - relativistic fluid during the formation of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "many extensions of the standard model of particle physics generally predict new dynamics between the electroweak and the planck scales together with a number of new particles , sometimes with the required properties to be dark matter . if dark matter is composed of these particles , it can decay on cosmological time - scales or , in the case that a conservation law forbids the decay , it can annihilate in pairs .",
    "dark matter decays or annihilations in our galaxy will produce electromagnetic radiation , anti - matter and cosmic rays which we can be observed at earth and serve as the first hints of dark matter non - gravitational interactions , provided their fluxes can be disentangled from astrophysical backgrounds .    such indirect detection of dark matter would not only provide us with a tangible glimpse of the existence of particle physics beyond the standard model , but would also allow a deeper understanding of structure formation .",
    "it may serve as a window into the early universe , probing times much closer to the big bang than primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "in addition , indirect signatures of dark matter can reveal its large scale distribution and may thus serve as a diagnostic for astrophysics . finally , decaying or annihilating dark matter",
    "can even have interesting consequences for stellar evolution .",
    "in this paper we develop a general formalism to derive information and constraints on decaying dark matter models .",
    "we focus on two observables , namely the cosmic positron flux on earth and the synchrotron radiation from electrons and positrons in the galactic magnetic fields for both of which exist detailed observational data .",
    "the positron flux has recently been carefully measured by the pamela collaboration  @xcite . for the synchrotron radiation , our analysis",
    "is based on three full - sky maps at 408 mhz  @xcite , 1.420 ghz  @xcite and 22 ghz  @xcite the latter from wmap .",
    "usually , constraints are derived in the literature for specific dark matter scenarios with given decay or annihilation spectra and branching ratios into final state products . for a given dark matter scenario one",
    "proceeds to compute the diffusion of electrons / positrons through the galaxy and the resulting synchrotron maps .",
    "one can then compare with observations and derive constraints as in  @xcite .",
    "this method can be tedious if one is to use detailed propagation models , specifically when including re - acceleration because a numerical treatment is then mandatory , or if one has to repeat many simulations to fit data or scan a parameter space .",
    "however , since the propagation equation is linear in the electron density , each injected electron energy evolves independently .",
    "therefore , with a finite number of numerical simulations at different injected energies we can construct a numerical _ response function _ of signal to background . these response functions do depend on astrophysical parameters such as the cosmic ray propagation model and the dark matter halo profile , but not on the microscopic decay scenario .",
    "constraints can then be simply obtained by requiring that the convolution of the response functions with a given dark matter decay spectrum be smaller than unity . in this paper , we have developed our own numerical propagation code to build such response functions and provide constraints on decaying dark matter .",
    "as a service to the model - builder we also provide analytic fits to our numerical response functions .    it should be noted that relatively large uncertainties from the propagation of cosmic rays and the dark matter halo density profile could make dark matter constraints relatively uncertain  @xcite .",
    "we therefore systematically investigate the model dependence of our response functions by taking into account different choices for propagation models and dark matter density profiles as well as for the galactic magnetic field .",
    "recently , the pamela  @xcite and atic  @xcite results show anomalously large fluxes of high energy positrons and electrons and indicate the presence of previously unaccounted nearby sources .",
    "the results from the pamela anti - matter search show a hard change of slope in the positron to electron ratio in the range 10 - 100 gev while at the same time the observed anti - proton flux nicely satisfies the expectations from being a secondary product of interactions of cosmic rays with the intergalactic medium .",
    "the atic collaboration reported an interesting bump in the energy range from 300 to 800 gev and a sharp cutoff near @xmath0 500 gev in the flux of electrons plus positrons .",
    "however , more recent results from the fermi / lat experiment indicate at most a considerably smaller excess  @xcite than the suggested by atic . in order to explain these features , much discussion of the possible sources",
    "has ensued in the literature .",
    "some conventional astrophysics sources such as a nearby pulsar  @xcite can explain the positron `` excess '' rather naturally . however , given the impact a discovery of dark matter would have , much discussion has been on dark matter annihilation or decay as the origin of the pamela and atic `` anomalies '' , see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite for a model independent discussion .",
    "appealing as they are , these scenarios also face a number of potential challenges .",
    "for instance , most dark matter models generate a softer spectrum in electrons and positrons than the pamela and atic data imply  @xcite . in the dark matter annihilation case ,",
    "boost factors of @xmath1 are required to normalize the observed signals  @xcite , but at the same time are in serious conflict with other observations such as radio emissions  @xcite , @xmath2rays and anti - protons  @xcite .",
    "we believe that our study can help the model builder in the quest for explaining the pamela positron fluxes , or in providing complementary bounds from the synchrotron radio maps .",

    "a more detailed numerical simulation is , therefore , called for .",
    "indirect effects such as radio emission in the galactic magnetic field , can give complementary constraints since they are sensitive not only to the local electron - positron flux but also to the electron - positron flux induced by dark matter decay in remote parts of the galaxy which is not directly measurable .",

    ", we have developed our own numerical code .",
    "details on our code and computations are described in appendix  a.    let us once more stress that our response functions do not depend on the specific decay spectrum , but still depend on the characteristics of the propagation model and the dark matter distribution . in this paper",

    "@xmath80 , our response functions have to be multiplied by @xmath81 gev @xmath79 .",

    ", we use the pamela data to get our constraints .",
    "it consists of seven different energies so we can construct seven different response functions , see section  5 .",
    "the synchrotron case is more complicated since in principle there are infinite directions to look at , and the optimal direction will depend on the injected spectrum @xmath69 and the observed frequency .",
    "we discuss this case in the next section .",
    "in this section we compute the radio emission induced by dark matter decay and establish the response function by comparison with radio observations . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_crit ] ) , the radio frequencies relevant for our study are between 0.1 and a few 100 ghz . although the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) would dominate the radio sky at frequencies above @xmath83 ghz , this signal can be removed from the foreground based on the sensitive multi - frequency survey performed by the wmap satellite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ob - map ] , we show the full sky surveys at the frequencies 408 mhz  @xcite , 1.42 ghz  @xcite , and 23 ghz  @xcite .",
    "we do not use the higher frequency channels ( 33 ghz , 41 ghz , 61 ghz , 94 ghz ) observed by wmap , as they are considerably more noisy and less robust to foreground subtraction than the lower frequency bands .",
    "in addition , we smoothed all maps to angular resolution of @xmath84 .      based on various global multi - frequency model fits , recently a public code has been made available  @xcite which allows to fit most of the radio survey observation in the range 10 mhz-100 ghz to accuracy around @xmath85 depending on frequency and sky region .",
    "to obtain the strongest possible constraints on radio emission due to dark matter decay , one would perform a pixel - by - pixel scan over the whole sky and over all frequencies between 0.1 mhz to 100 ghz .",
    "most of the observed radio maps , however , have only partial sky coverage .",
    "although these uncovered regions can be interpolated by global model fits , we want to rely on direct observations so we only use the 408 mhz , 1.42 ghz and 23 ghz full sky survey maps for our study .",
    "recently , an excess of microwave emission in the inner @xmath86 around the center of our galaxy has been revealed in wmap bands between 22 and 93 ghz , after a subtraction of the free - free , dust and standard synchrotron emissions .",
    "this excess , dubbed as `` wmap haze ''  @xcite , is distributed with approximate radial symmetry and is uncorrelated with the known foregrounds .",
    "the use of this haze map with subtracted `` known '' foregrounds could further strengthen our constraints on decaying dark matter easily by an order of magnitude as has been shown already in the case of dark matter annihilation in  @xcite .",
    "we have , in fact , also performed this analysis and found the same order of magnitude improvement in the constraints than ref .",
    "in addition , the 22 ghz emission is likely dominated by spinning dust , as well as synchrotron and thermal dust emission .",
    "the synchrotron emission can be constrained from its polarized emission  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the astrophysical backgrounds themselves depend to some extent on the not very well known galactic magnetic field and cosmic ray propagation parameters .",

    "[ fig:1.42g_models ] , it is clear that the largest uncertainty of synchrotron radiation comes from the propagation models .",

    "for the min model , since the height of the diffusion zone is smallest , most of the radio emissions occurs at low latitudes . in other propagation models",

    "compared to the diffusion models min , med and max , the dc and dr models always produce smaller signals over the whole diffusion zone .",

    "we also study the variation of the synchrotron emission due to different halo profiles . in general , decaying dark matter with the nfw profile produces the largest average diffuse radio signals due to the relatively steeper slope of the density distribution . for the other two profiles the emissions are comparable with each other . since the decay rate is only proportional to the density , uncertainties from the halo profiles do not alter the resulting dark matter constraints significantly .",

    "the optimal directions are shown in the caption . as indicated before ,",

    "this is because the best direction points far from the galactic center , see fig .",
    "[ fig : excess ] , where the different halo models considered are similar . on general grounds ,",
    "if the optimal direction is close to the galactic center , the excess emission will be more sensitive to the halo profile since there the dark matter density is more uncertain in the absence of sufficiently high resolution numerical simulations .     as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] , for the radio excess maps , the max propagation model always gives the strongest constraints .",
    "the dc and dr models , which exhibit similar behavior , one clearly sees an exponential cut off at low injection energies , whereas the response functions for the min , med and max models are dropping more slowly with decreasing energy .",
    "this is not surprising since , in the latter case , re - acceleration shifts lower energy electrons to higher energies .",
    "the drop at low energies in these models is strongest at the highest frequencies at which re - acceleration of the corresponding higher energy electrons is less efficient .",
    "we note that in order to reproduce the observed b / c data , the re - acceleration zone in the min , med and max models should be limited to a slab of height @xmath95kpc , comparable to the height of the gaseous disk .",
    "if the re - acceleration region would extend to the full height @xmath96 of the diffusive region , the response function would be flatter and its values would be higher by about a factor of 3 above a few tens of gev .    to illustrate these points we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_e ] electron spectra in the galactic disc at 1 kpc from the center and 0.2 kpc above the disk , for different propagation models and injection energies .",
    "when re - acceleration is included , we get a noticeable bump in the spectrum at a few gev . above these energies ,",
    "the energy loss generated from inverse compton scattering and synchrotron emission dominates over energy gain by re - acceleration , and below a few gev , re - acceleration overcompensates the energy losses .",
    "thus a visible bump appears when the electrons accumulate in an energy region where re - acceleration and energy losses offset each other .",
    "it seems that the amplitude and the position of the bump is independent of the injection energy below a few gev .",
    "the large amount of electrons and positrons accumulating in this bump region induce most of the radio signals around ghz frequencies .",
    "that is why the shape of the response function drops more gradually in the lower energy region in the min , med and max models compared to the exponential drop in the dc and dr models .    in the dc model ,",
    "due to the absence of re - acceleration , the energy spectra appear as a sawtooth shape as the number of propagated electrons above the injection energy have a sharp cutoff .",
    "similarly , in the dr model , since the electrons and positrons can not gain enough energy from re - acceleration due to the larger diffusion parameter and the smaller alfven speed , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dpp ] ) , the propagated energy spectrum above the injection energy tends to zero rapidly .",
    "another interesting property of the response function is that it tends to fall at high energies .",
    "this can be understood as follows : higher energy electrons either loose energy more quickly , or , if their energy loss length is still larger than the half height of the diffusion zone , can propagate further and can thus escape from the diffusion zone more readily . the diffusion length can be estimated as @xmath97 a few kpc , and is comparable to the the thickness of the diffusion zone in the min and med models . as a consequence , in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum_e ] for the min and med models , the propagated spectrum is indeed smaller by factors of a few for the highest injection energies . in the case of the max model ,",
    "the half height of the diffusion zone is considerably larger than the typical diffusion scale so that the injection energy has a weak impact on electron spectrum below 100 gev .",
    "we note that the choice of the diffusion models and the injection energy affect the shape of the electron spectrum significantly only below 100 gev , where the influence of the diffusion mechanism on electron and positron propagation is still important . for energies above 100 gev",
    ", energy loss dominates the electron spectrum .",
    "the spectrum in this energy range thus should only depend on the isrf and magnetic field and not significantly on the diffusion parameters , as is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_e ] . the plots for the dc and dr models , for which re - acceleration is insignificant ,",
    "confirm our qualitative analysis .",
    "for instance , for 10 tev injection , a flat spectrum appears at energies above 100 gev , below which the spectrum steadily drops due to electron diffusion .",
    "the response function reaches its maximum around the critical energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_crit ] ) corresponding to the energy at which electrons emit photons of the considered frequency @xmath70 ( namely about 5 gev for 408 mhz , 9 gev for 1.42 ghz and 20 gev for 23 ghz , for slowly varying magnetic field of @xmath98 g strength in the regions of interest ) .",
    "we also note that the response function for the dc and dr models tend to give stronger constraints than the min scenario for the 23 ghz map .",

    "in our study we have computed the prediction for two important signatures from decaying dark matter , namely the synchrotron emission in our galaxy and the positron flux . in view of the recent experimental observations such as the radio full sky surveys and the new pamela data , we have introduced useful response functions that can be applied to constrain any interesting decay models .",
    "robust constraints can be obtained in terms of convolving the response function with the specific decay spectrum into electrons and positrons .",
    "our results show that the resulting constraints depend mostly on the set of propagation parameters rather than the halo profiles and reveal re - acceleration as an important ingredient .",
    "we have finally applied our method to provide model independent constraints on two widely discussed decay modes and studied the implications for some more concrete realizations . in some cases , specifically when choosing the propagation models with largest re - acceleration parameters our methods rule out recently proposed decaying dark matter models .",
    "we shall emphasize here that the methods showed in this paper can be used for other observables like gamma radiation , high energy neutrinos , etc ... and can be also used for the case of annihilating dark matter .",
    "dark matter decays or annihilations can also affect the extragalactic radio background . compared with other astrophysical sources , dark matter could lead to discriminable anisotropic features in our radio sky  @xcite . using future radio observation such as by ska  @xcite , possible signals of dark matter annihilation or decay could be discovered .",
