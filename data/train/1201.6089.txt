    "we assume that @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a discrete - time process @xmath12 with values in  @xmath10 , adapted to a filtration @xmath13 . for the process  @xmath14",
    ", we suppose that it is uniformly elliptic ( can advance in any given direction with uniformly positive probability ) , has uniformly bounded jumps , and is a _ strongly directed _ submartingale ( see definition  [ d_terms ] below for the precise meaning ) . in principle",
    ", we do not assume homogeneity in space and/or time , or even the fact that the process is markovian .",
    "in this paper we study two related questions :    * how many different sites can be visited by the process  @xmath14 by time  @xmath3 ? * how large can be the number of visits to a given site ?",
    "of course , in the absence of space / time homogeneity one can not hope to be able to characterize the precise behavior of the quantities of interest ; in this paper we content ourselves in proving that with probability @xmath15 the number of visits to any fixed site by time  @xmath3 is less than  @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "this in its turn implies that the number is different sites visited by the process by time  @xmath3 with very high probability will be at least  @xmath6 .    although it is not important for the formulation of our results , while reading the paper one may always assume that  @xmath10 is the vertex set of the integer lattice  @xmath16 , the vertex set of some other mosaic , or just any `` discrete '' ( in particular , countable ) set .",
    "this , of course , is justified by the questions that are of our interest : e.g. , if the law of the jump of the process is ( in some sense ) continuous , then such questions typically do not arise ( every site is visited at most once , and the process visits  @xmath3 different sites by time  @xmath3 ) .    range ( i.e. , the cardinality of the set visited sites , or sometimes this set itself ) and the local time ( i.e. , the number of visits to a given site ) for space - homogeneous discrete - time random walks were extensively studied in the literature . it is a classical result that the expected range of the simple random walk is @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 , see e.g.  section  6.1 of  @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain from this fact ( using an independence argument as e.g.  in lemma  3.1 of  @xcite ) that with very high probability the walk visits at least @xmath21 distinct sites by time  @xmath3 .",
    "finer results for the range of homogeneous random walks can be found in a number of papers ; see e.g.  in  @xcite and references therein . for nonhomogeneous",
    "random walks these questions , of course , are more difficult ; we mention  @xcite that contains results on the range of simple random walk on supercritical percolation cluster .",
    "the behaviour of the local time ( i.e. , the number of visits ) in a fixed site , or the field of local times in all sites , was much studied in the literature as well .",
    "it is quite elementary to obtain that the expected number of visits to the origin by time  @xmath3 for the simple random walk is @xmath22 for @xmath18 and  @xmath23 for @xmath20 .",
    "also , one can easily obtain for the simple random walk in dimension  @xmath24 ( using e.g.  * e1 * of section  iii.16 of  @xcite ) that , with stretched - exponentially small probability , the number of visits to the origin is less than  @xmath25 for any fixed  @xmath5 . of course",
    ", finer results ( for more general random walks as well ) are available ; see e.g.@xcite .    as mentioned above , with our assumptions",
    "we can not hope to obtain very `` precise '' results ; however , in some cases it may be important to be able to estimate the range from below . in particular ,",
    "consider the following process , called _ excited random walk _ , or sometimes _ cookie random walk_. it is a discrete - time stochastic process taking values on  @xmath16 , @xmath1 , described in the following way : when the particle visits a site for the first time , it has a uniformly positive drift in a given direction  @xmath26 ; when the particle is at a site which was already visited before , it has zero drift ( observe that this implies that the cookie random walk is a strongly directed submartingale in the sense of definition  [ d_terms ] below ) .",
    "this process was introduced in a simpler form ( @xmath26  is the first coordinate vector and in already visited sites the process behaves as simple random walk ) in  @xcite and then studied ( we mention only the papers that are concerned with dimension @xmath1 ) in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the key fact that is usually needed is that such a process typically visits much more than  @xmath27 different sites by time  @xmath3 ; this allows to prove bounds on the probability that the process advances in the direction of cookies drift by much more than  @xmath28 , and this in turn makes is possible to use regeneration arguments that imply the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem .",
    "it is worth noting that in this paper , differently from what was considered in  @xcite , we allow the process to have a nonzero drift of arbitrarily small absolute value ; for such processes , a direct application of methods of  @xcite fails .",
    "now , we write formal definitions and state our results .",

    "now , we see that this proof is in sharp contrast with the proof of theorem  [ t_submart2 ] .",
    "originally , our intention was to find a proof for theorem  [ t_submart2 ] that would use lyapunov functions in a similar way ; this amounts to finding a function  @xmath264 with the following properties : @xmath265 on @xmath266 , @xmath267 for some @xmath228 , and @xmath268 is a submartingale , where @xmath269 is the hitting time of @xmath270 .",
    "a possible idea would be to modify somehow the function  @xmath271 of formula  ( 3.5 ) of  @xcite , but we did not succeed in developing it properly .",
    "a natural question is if the results of theorems  [ t_mart ] and  [ t_submart2 ] can be improved . as for the results for the local time ( and  ) , it is not the case , as the following example shows :    [ ex_manyvisits ] consider a zero - drift random walk on  @xmath68 , defined in the way indicated on figure  [ f_recurrent_zd ] .",
    "more specifically , we first divide the plane in sectors with ( small enough ) angle  @xmath272 , and then define the transition probabilities in each sector in such a way , roughly speaking , that the walk `` prefers '' the radial direction to the transversal one . for any fixed  @xmath248 ,",
    "it is clear that one can define the parameters of the model so that the expression in the parentheses in the right - hand side of   is negative for all large enough  @xmath63 ( because the absolute value of the cosine in   will typically be close to  @xmath235 ) .",
    "applying theorem  1 of  @xcite , we obtain that @xmath273 for any @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the hitting time of the origin .",
    "but this implies that there typically will be  @xmath276 visits to the origin by time  @xmath3 ( and that , with probability stretched - exponentially close to  @xmath235 , the number of visits will be at least @xmath277 , where  @xmath278 is an arbitrarily small positive number ) .",
    "however , the situation with   and   is less clear : it is an open problem to find out if   ( respectively , ) should be valid for all  @xmath279 ( respectively , for all  @xmath280 ) . in fact , the authors were unable to find any examples of uniformly elliptic martingales with uniformly bounded jumps for which the expected range is of order less than that of the simple random walk ( as mentioned in the introduction , it is @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 ) .",
