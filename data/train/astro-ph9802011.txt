    "correlation functions are very powerful statistics to describe the large scale structures in the universe ( @xcite 1980 , hereafter p80 ) .",
    "the lowest order , the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) @xmath17 , has been widely used to measure the clustering strength of galaxies and to confront models of cosmic structure formation .",
    "quite a number of large galaxy catalogs , both angular and redshift , have been used to determine the 2pcf , and this statistic has now been established quite well ( @xcite 1998 , hereafter jmb98 ; @xcite 1998 in preparation ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1996 ; @xcite 1996 ; @xcite 1995 for a review before 1995 ) .",
    "this statistic has produced several constraints on theoretical models already despite the fact that there are many ingredients to a specific model which can be optimally adapted to the properties of the galaxy sample .",
    "the cosmological parameters , like the initial power spectrum of the dm component and the bias , i.e. the difference in the clustering of galaxies and dm particles , can all be adjusted to some extent .",
    "the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) @xmath18 is a further statistic useful in characterizing the clustering of galaxies ( p80 ) .",
    "its measurement can give additional constraints for cosmogonic models .",
    "the determination of the 3pcf was pioneered by peebles and his coworkers in the seventies . based on their careful analysis of the lick and",
    "zwicky angular catalogs of galaxies they propose a so - called  hierarchical \" form [ hier ] = q with the constant @xmath19 .",
    "this form is valid for scales @xmath20 ( p80 ) .",
    "the analysis of the eso - uppsala catalog of galaxies ( @xcite 1982 ) by @xcite ( 1991 ) supports this result .",
    "the 3pcf was also examined for the cfa , aat and koss redshift samples of galaxies ( @xcite 1981 ; @xcite 1983 ; @xcite 1984 ; @xcite 1989 ) . because all these redshift samples are small ( with @xmath21 galaxies )",
    ", these authors were not able to examine the validity of the hierarchical form in redshift space .",
    "instead they just forced a fit of the hierarchical form and obtained the value of @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath22 value of redshift samples obtained in this way is around @xmath23 ( @xcite 1984 ) , much smaller than the value advocated by peebles and his coworkers .",
    "the difference may partially be attributed to the redshift distortion effect which reduces the @xmath22 value ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "the skewness analysis of the 1.2 jy iras survey of galaxies has given a similar @xmath22 value ( @xcite 1993 ) .",
    "the hierarchical form ( eq .",
    "[ hier ] ) is purely empirical .",
    "there is no solid theoretical argument supporting this form .",
    "in contrast , the second - order perturbation theory predicts that @xmath22 depends on the shape of the triangle and on the slope of the linear power spectrum ( @xcite 1984 ) in the linear regime . for a cdm - like power spectrum with a slope which changes with the scale ,",
    "@xmath22 then varies with the size and shape of a triangle ( @xcite 1997 ) . even in the strongly non - linear regime where the hierarchical form was established",
    ", the cdm models do not seem to obey this form as demonstrated by @xcite ( 1994 ) based on n - body simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite ( 1997 ) have re - examined , based on the bbgky equation , the stable clustering ( strongly non - linear ) problem and pointed out that the hierarchical form holds if the clustering is stable .",
    "the question is if the condition of stable clustering can be achieved in the real universe ( @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "the 3pcf of galaxies carries much useful information which is important for cosmogonic models .",
    "the theories based on cdm models predict that the 3pcf of galaxies depends on the shape of the linear power spectrum ( @xcite 1984 ; @xcite 1997 ) and the galaxy biasing relative to the underlying mass ( @xcite 1985 ; @xcite 1994 ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1997 ; @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "it might also be sensitive to a possible non - gaussianity of the initial density fluctuation ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore the 3pcf must be determined accurately if one wants to use the cosmic virial theorem to obtain the mean density of the universe .",
    "we have carried out a detailed analysis of the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite 1996 ) , and in this paper we report the measurement of the 3pcf of galaxies in this survey .",
    "we have not only measured the 3pcf in redshift space but also developed a method to measure the projected 3pcf which has simple relations to the real space 3pcf (  3.1 ) .",
    "our methods are checked very carefully with the help of mock catalogs generated from n - body simulations , and the physical meaning of these two quantities is also investigated (  3.2 ) .",
    "our statistical results are compared with previous work , with the emphasis on a critical examination of the hypothesis of the hierarchical form (  3.4 ) . as we will see",
    ", the hierarchical form does not seem to be a good prescription even in the strong clustering regime .",
    "we will present a new fitting formula in  3.3 .",
    "implications for cosmogonic models are discussed in  4 .",
    "the sample used for our analysis is the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite 1996 ; hereafter lcrs ) .",
    "this is the largest redshift survey , which is now publicly available .",
    "our sample consists of all galaxies with recession velocities between 10,000 and 45,000 @xmath24 and with absolute magnitudes ( in the lcrs hybrid r band ) between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are 19558 galaxies in this sample , of which 9480 are in the three north slices and the rest in the three south slices .",
    "the survey is a well - calibrated sample of galaxies , ideally suited for statistical studies of large - scale structure .",
    "all known systematic effects in the survey are well quantified and documented ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ; lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , and so most can be corrected easily in statistical analyses . the only exception is the ` fiber collision ' limitation which prevents two galaxies in one @xmath27 field from being observed when they are closer than @xmath28 on the sky , because it is impossible to put fibers on both objects simultaneously . here we will use extensively mock catalogs generated from n - body simulations to quantify this effect .",
    "the real - space 2pcf and the pairwise velocity dispersion ( pvd ) have been determined for the lcrs by jmb98 .",
    "the redshift - space 2pcf and power spectrum for this sample were presented by @xcite ( 1997 ) and @xcite ( 1997 ) respectively .",
    "all these studies have shown that the lcrs is large enough to accurately measure these low order statistical quantities .",
    "in particular , jmb98 have carried out a detailed comparison between the observed 2pcf and pvd and the predictions of currently favoured cdm cosmogonies .",
    "they have used a large set of mock samples to adequately compare models and observations .",
    "the construction of mock catalogues from the simulations , i.e. photometric catalogues subject to the same selection effects as the real observations are a very important aspect of their analysis , because only in this way could the statistical significance of the results be asserted .",
    "three spatially flat models have been considered in jmb98 , with ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31,@xmath32)=(0.2,0.8,0.2,1 . ) , ( 0.3,0.7,0.2,1 . ) , and ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.5 , 0.62 ) , where @xmath29 is the density parameter , @xmath30 is the cosmological constant , @xmath33 and @xmath32 are the shape parameter and normalization of the cdm power spectrum ( @xcite 1986 ) .",
    "all of the models give a steeper 2pcf , and a higher pvd on small scales than the data .",
    "thus unless galaxies are biased with respect to the mass with a scale - dependent bias , all these models can be ruled out .",
    "unfortunately physical models for a density or a ( not so wanted , but perhaps unavoidable ) velocity bias are not on firm grounds . therefore in jmb98 a simple , but plausible phenomenological model for the bias has been suggested . to suppress the number of pairs in the dm distribution at small separations , it is assumed that the number of galaxies per unit dark matter mass @xmath34 is smaller in massive halos than in less massive ones . if a behaviour such as @xmath35 with @xmath36 is used for clusters of mass @xmath37 , the predictions of some cdm models are consistent with the observational results .",
    "the best agreement was achieved for the flat @xmath38 model .",
    "we will use 10 mock catalogs of this model to test our statistical methods and quantify the ` fiber collision ' effect .",
    "since this model has reproduced the lcrs 2pcf and pvd , we believe these mock catalogs are very suitable for this purpose",
    ". we shall also use these mock samples for model testing , as an example to illustrate the power of the three - point correlation function in discriminating between models which have similar two - point correlations . since the model is a typical cdm model",
    ", we will generalize the discussion to other cdm models .",
    "the three - point correlation function ( 3pcf ) @xmath18 is defined , through the joint probability @xmath39 of finding one object simultaneously in each of the three volume elements @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 at positions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , as follows ( p80 ) : [ 3pcfdf ] dp_123=d d d where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the mean density of galaxies at @xmath48 .",
    "this definition can be applied straightforwardly to redshift surveys of galaxies to measure the 3pcf @xmath49 of galaxies in redshift space ( at this point we neglect the anisotropy induced by the redshift distortion which will be considered later ) . here and below we use @xmath50 to denote the real space and @xmath51 the redshift space .",
    "the 3pcf of galaxies can be measured from the counts of different triplets ( p80 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "a sample of randomly distributed points , which has exactly the same boundaries and the same observational selection effects as the real survey , is generated .",
    "four types of distinct triplets with triangles in the range ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) are counted : the count @xmath55 of triplets formed by three galaxies ; the count @xmath56 of triplets formed by two galaxies and one random point ; the count @xmath57 of triplets formed by one galaxy and two random points ; the count @xmath58 of triplets formed by three random points .",
    "following the definition [ eq([3pcfdf ] ) ] , we shall use the following estimator [ 3pcfred ] & = & 27 rrr^2ddddrr^3 + & & - 9 rrrddrdrr^2 + 2 to measure the 3pcf of the galaxies in redshift space .",
    "the above formula is slightly different from the estimator used by groth & peebles ( 1977 ) .",
    "here we have extended the argument of @xcite ( 1993 ) for the 2pcf to the case of the 3pcf .",
    "the coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 are due to the fact that only _",
    "distinct _ triplets are counted in this paper . since the early work of peebles and coworkers ( p80 ) indicates that the 3pcf of galaxies is approximately hierarchical , it is convenient to express the 3pcf in a normalized form @xmath61 : [ qred ] q_red= + +",
    ". it is also convenient to use the variables introduced by peebles ( p80 ) to describe the shape of the triangles formed by the galaxy triplets . for a triangle with the three sides @xmath62 , @xmath6 , @xmath63 , and @xmath10",
    "are defined as : [ ruv ] s = s_12 , u = s_23 , v = s_31-s_23 .",
    "clearly , @xmath63 and @xmath10 characterize the shape and @xmath6 the size of a triangle .",
    "we take equal logarithmic bins for @xmath6 and @xmath63 with the bin intervals @xmath64 , and equal linear bins for @xmath10 with @xmath65 . for our analysis ,",
    "we take the following ranges for @xmath6 , @xmath63 and @xmath10 : @xmath66 ( @xmath67 bins ) ; @xmath68 ( 3 bins ) ; and @xmath69 ( 5 bins ) .    a sample of 25,000 random points is first generated .",
    "the counts @xmath70 are less than @xmath71 for small triangles ( @xmath72 ) . in order to suppress the fluctuation induced by the random samples ,",
    "we have recalculated the counts @xmath70 for @xmath73 by generating a random sample 10 times larger , which ensure that the counts @xmath70 are at least @xmath74 of the interested triangle configurations .",
    "we scaled these counts to 25,000 random points and also use these counts to get @xmath75 on the small scales since @xmath76 is constant .",
    "however , it is not trivial to search triplets for so many points .",
    "we have generalized the ordinary linked - list technique of @xmath77 simulations ( @xcite 1980 ) to spherical coordinates to count the triplets .",
    "the linked - list cells are specified by the spherical coordinates , i.e. the right accession @xmath78 , the declination @xmath79 and the distance @xmath6 . with this short - range searching technique",
    ", we can avoid the triplets out of the range specified thus making counting triplets very efficient .",
    "the 3pcf in redshift space @xmath80 depends both on the real space distribution of galaxies and on their peculiar motions .",
    "although this information contained in @xmath80 is also useful for the study of the large scale structures ( see  4 ) , it is apparent that @xmath80 is different from @xmath12 in real space . in analogy with the analysis for the two - point correlation function , we have determined the projected three - point correlation function @xmath81 .",
    "we define the redshift space three - point correlation function @xmath82 through : [ 3pcfzdf ] dp^z_123&= & d d d where @xmath83 is the joint probability of finding one object simultaneously in each of the three volume elements @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 at positions @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; @xmath90 is the redshift space two - point correlation function ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the separations of objects @xmath93 and @xmath94 perpendicular to and along the line - of - sight respectively .",
    "the projected 3pcf @xmath81 is then defined as : [ 3pcfproj1 ] = d_12 d_23 because the total amount of triplets along the line - of - sight is not distorted by the peculiar motions , the projected 3pcf @xmath81 is related to the 3pcf in real space @xmath18 : [ 3pcfproj2 ] = ( , , ) dy_12 dy_23 .",
    "similarly as for @xmath49 , we measure @xmath82 by counting the numbers of triplets @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 formed by galaxies and/or random points with the projected separations @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 and radial separations @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we will use @xmath7 , @xmath63 and @xmath10 : [ rpuv ] r_p = r_p12 , u = r_p23 , v = r_p31-r_p23 . to quantify a triangle with @xmath104 on the projected plane .",
    "equal logarithmic bins of intervals @xmath105 are taken for @xmath7 and @xmath63 , and equal linear bins of @xmath65 for @xmath10 .",
    "the same ranges of @xmath63 and @xmath10 are used as for @xmath106 , but @xmath7 is from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ( 7 bins ) .",
    "the radial separations @xmath102 and @xmath103 are from @xmath109 to @xmath110 with a bin size of @xmath111 .",
    "the projected 3pcf is estimated by summing up @xmath112 at different radial bins ( @xmath113 ) : [ pistat ] = _ i , j _",
    "z(r_p , u , v,^i_12,^j_23 ) ^i_12 ^j_23 and normalized as [ qproj ] = ( r_p , u , v ) + + . where @xmath114 is the projected two - point correlation function ( @xcite 1983 ; jmb98 ) [ wrp ] = _ i_z(r_p,^i)^i an interesting property of the projected 3pcf is that if the three - point correlation function is of the hierarchical form , the normalized function @xmath9 is not only a constant but also equal to @xmath22 . therefore the measurement of @xmath9 can be used to test the hierarchical form which was proposed mainly based on the analysis of angular catalogs .",
    "to test the reliability of our statistical analysis and to demonstrate the effects of the redshift distortion , the projection , and the fiber collisions , we make use of the full simulation and the mock catalogs .",
    "because the mock samples are cluster-(under)weighted , we have applied the same weighting to the full simulation to achieve a proper comparison . to calculate the quantities in redshift space for the full simulation , we assume that the third axis is along the line - of - sight .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) we compare @xmath80 estimated with our statistical method from the mock samples with the _ true _ value . the latter is determined from the full simulation using the method of @xcite ( 1997 ) . on the scales from @xmath111 to @xmath115 ,",
    "the two estimated quantities agree fairly well , indicating that the lcrs can yield an unbiased estimate within the error bars of the 3pcf in redshift space .",
    "the test is important , considering the fact that the lcrs is essentially two - dimensional with one dimension in the direction of the line - of - sight .    fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) shows the projected @xmath9 estimated from the mock samples with the method described above .",
    "the true @xmath9 can be calculated from the _ real space _",
    "3pcf @xmath116 through eq .",
    "( [ 3pcfproj2 ] ) .",
    "we determine @xmath116 for the full simulation using the method of @xcite ( 1997 ) and calculate the integral of eq.([3pcfproj2 ] ) by linearly interpolating the estimated @xmath116 .",
    "the two estimated quantities agree very well within the error bars , indicating that our method can give a correct estimate of the projected 3pcf .",
    "the real space 3pcf @xmath12 is also shown in the figure by the thick lines .",
    "it decreases with the scale @xmath117 , as noted previously ( @xcite 1994 ; @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "the reason for the decrease is due to the fact that the slope of the power spectrum is more negative on smaller scales ( see jing , in preparation , for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the consequence is that due to the averaging of @xmath12 on scales @xmath118 [ eq.([3pcfproj2 ] ) ] , the projected @xmath9 is also a decreasing function of @xmath7 but smaller than @xmath12 for @xmath119 ( compare thick and thin lines in the figure ) .",
    "another interesting point is that @xmath12 is much higher than its counterpart in redshift space @xmath80 on scales @xmath120 .",
    "this result is well - known since the redshift distortion smears out the dense clusters and thus reduces the 3pcf on small scales ( e.g. @xcite 1994 ; @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "we have also tested for the fiber collision effect of the lcrs sample as we did for the 2pcf and pvd in jmb98 .",
    "while both the 2pcf [ @xmath121 and @xmath122 and the 3pcf [ @xmath106 and @xmath123 show some small dependence on this effect , it cancels out completely , when we divide these two quantities by one another to form the normalized 3pcf @xmath80 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the fiber collisions of the lcrs have little effect on the normalized functions @xmath80 and @xmath9 .    in summary , these tests have convinced us that our method is suitable for giving a stable measurement of the 3pcf from the lcrs with reliable error estimates .",
    "we present our results of the 3pcf in redshift space @xmath80 and of the projected 3pcf @xmath9 in figures ( [ fig3 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) respectively for the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "the errors of the @xmath22-values are the bootstrap errors which are estimated with the approximate formula of @xcite ( 1992 ) . as we can see from fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , the 3pcf obtained from redshift space is not changing very much with @xmath6 or @xmath63 ; it increases somewhat with @xmath10 . for small @xmath10",
    ", @xmath124 is approximately constant with a value of @xmath125 , but it increases up to @xmath126 when @xmath127 . compared with the 3pcf in redshift space , the projected one @xmath9 [ figure  ( [ fig4 ] ) ] shows quite similar dependences on triangle shape ( i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath10 ) , but quite a different dependence on the triangle size ( i.e. @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , though the errors of the projected 3pcf are larger .",
    "its value decreases with @xmath7 from about @xmath128 at @xmath129 to @xmath130 at @xmath7 about @xmath131 . _",
    "both this decrease with growing @xmath7 and the weak increase with @xmath10 are in contrast to the hierarchical assumption_. if the three - point correlation function in real space were hierarchical , equation ( [ 3pcfproj2 ] ) shows that the projected one would also be hierarchical and equal to @xmath22 .",
    "this behavior , however , is qualitatively in agreement with the cdm model predictions , and we will discuss this point in  4",
    ".    the hierarchical form ( eq.1 ) does not seem to provide an adequate description of our results of the 3pcf in redshift space @xmath80 or of the projected 3pcf @xmath9 .",
    "we have looked for fitting formulae for both quantities .",
    "our results can be fitted quite well by @xmath0v^2}$ ] and @xmath3 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are in unit of @xmath8 ) , which are the smooth lines on figure ( [ fig3 ] ) and the thick lines on figure ( [ fig4 ] ) . we have neglected the weak systematic dependence on @xmath10 of @xmath9 at @xmath132 in fitting this quantity since the dependence is not statistically significant on the scales we probed . we do not intend to give an error estimate for the coefficients in the formulae , since the errors of the @xmath22-values in individual bins are likely non - gaussian distributed and correlated among different bins . these formulae are intended to give a simple , but for most purposes accurate , approximation to our statistical results .    since the real space 3pcf @xmath116 possibly depends on @xmath117 , @xmath63 and @xmath10 in a complicated way , the inversion of eq.([3pcfproj2 ] ) to get @xmath116 from the projected @xmath133 is certainly unstable .",
    "we have noted however that the projected @xmath9 can be modeled very well by _",
    "the value of the mock projected @xmath134 [ the thin lines in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) ] , which means that @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the real - space 3pcf of the cdm model , is a good approximation to the real - space 3pcf of lcrs galaxies on scales @xmath137 .",
    "these @xmath12 can be easily read out from the @xmath136 in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .      the high quality of the lcrs survey , by its ccd photometry , its complete redshift information and its large size , has enabled us to give a reliable determination of the 3pcf .",
    "it is the first time that the three - point correlation functions both in redshift space and in real ( projected ) space can be measured as a function of the triangle size and shape , with only a fractional error in each individual bin , for a wide range of triangle configurations .",
    "although our statistical results in real space on scales @xmath138 are not far from the hierarchical prediction ( 1 ) with @xmath139 ( @xcite 1977 ; gp77 ) , the systematic changes of @xmath9 with the triangle configurations clearly point to a more elaborate model for @xmath12 .",
    "one such model was already proposed in  3.3 .",
    "although our result of @xmath80 generally agrees with the previous studies based on much smaller redshift samples ( see  1 ) , our measurement has much better accuracy .",
    "recently there are concerns about the reliability of the high - order correlation functions derived from photographic - plates based galaxy catalogs .",
    "the skewness of the galaxies derived from the automatic plate machine ( apm ) angular catalog ( @xcite 1990 ) and from the edinburgh / durham southern galaxy catalogue ( edsgc , @xcite 1989 ) is significantly different even on small scales @xmath140 ( @xcite 1994 ; @xcite 1996 ) , despite the fact that both catalogs are constructed from the same uk iiia - j schmidt photographic plates and the latter is just a sub - sample ( @xmath141 ) of the former .",
    "the difference seems to arise from their different methods to digitalize the plates ( @xcite 1998 ) , and at this point it is rather difficult to judge which method is superior .",
    "it is also worth noting that the 3pcf results of gp77 are somewhat sensitive to the corrections they have applied to the lick catalog .",
    "fortunately the lcrs survey does not suffer from these uncertainties since its photometric catalog was constructed from the ccd drift scans .",
    "furthermore in our analysis we did not have to apply any additional corrections except for those well - documented by the survey team .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the skewness @xmath142 determined from the large angular catalogs , in particular since the two studies based on the apm and edscg catalogs have yielded rather discrepant results .",
    "the skewness is related to the 3pcf through an integral as follows : [ s3r ] s_3(r)&=&|(r)^2(r ) +     @xmath143 .",
    "it needs full information of @xmath12 to calculate the skewness [ eq .  ( [ s3r ] ) ] , and we use the model proposed in  3.3 .",
    "the skewness @xmath142 for the lcrs survey is then about @xmath144 at @xmath145 and about @xmath146 at @xmath147 , which seem in agreement with the results of @xcite ( 1996 ) based on the edsgc catalog but significantly higher than the apm results of @xcite ( 1994 ) on the scales @xmath148 .",
    "the cosmic virial theorem ( cvt ) has been widely used to measure the mean density of the universe .",
    "if the 3pcf is hierarchical , the cvt can be expressed in its simplified form relating the density parameter @xmath29 , @xmath17 , @xmath22 , and the pvd @xmath149 . since our results show that the 3pcf is not hierarchical , this relation becomes much more complicated and it is necessary to work out the integration over @xmath18 which might depend on @xmath18 on very small scales @xmath150 . since @xmath18 is a decreasing function of the triangle size , previous studies which usually used the @xmath22 value at @xmath151 might have overestimated the mean density .",
    "the size of galaxies , which are usually treated as point sources in the cvt application , may also be important in the estimate of the mean density , especially near @xmath150 ( @xcite 1976 ; @xcite 1997 ) .",
    "we would like to remark here that the significant difference between @xmath152 and @xmath153 at small scales comes from peculiar motions of galaxies .",
    "this gives another possibility to estimate the velocity dispersion of galaxies ( @xcite 1994 ) .",
    "in this section we compare the 3pcf of the lcrs with model predictions .",
    "@xcite ( 1997 ) and jing ( in preparation ) have recently studied the 3pcf @xmath12 for a set of cdm models based on second - order perturbation theory and n - boby simulations .",
    "we found that for fixed @xmath63 and @xmath10 , @xmath12 is a decreasing function of the size @xmath117 . in the strongly non - linear regime ( @xmath154",

    "@xmath12 increases significantly with @xmath10 for fixed @xmath117 and @xmath63 .",
    "all these features are found in the projected @xmath9 of the lcrs galaxies",

    "could the redshift distortion and the projection effects be accounted for properly . from the figures we find that the qualitative features , i.e. the dependence on @xmath10 for fixed @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and @xmath63 , the decrease of @xmath22 with increasing values of @xmath6 or @xmath7 are reproduced quite well in the mock samples .",
    "the values of the data set , however , are consistently lower than the mean model predictions by a factor @xmath155 . since the @xmath22-values in each bin of the ten mock samples are not gaussian distributed ( skewed to high values ) , it is not meaningful to use the standard deviation to quantify the statistical significance",
    ". instead we pick up the lowest of the ten mock @xmath124 or @xmath156 values in each bin and compare it with the observed results .",
    "the thick lines in figs .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) and ( [ fig6 ] ) correspond to these lowest values for @xmath157 , which should be compared with the open triangles .",
    "these lines are still higher than ( in most bins ) or at least as high as ( in a few bins ) the observational values , which indicates that the observational values are lower than this model s predictions at a confidence level @xmath158 .",
    "the underlying model for the mock sample is a cdm universe with @xmath38 and @xmath159 and with clusters underweighted ( see  2 ) .",
    "we have computed the 3pcf for this universe _ without _ cluster weighting , and found the cluster weighting , like the fiber collision effect , does not change much the value of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , even if this model fits the 2pcf and the pvd of the lcrs galaxies quite well , it seems not really adequate to describe the clustering of galaxies when the 3pcf is considered , unless the observed 3pcf is biased low by the cosmic variance [ at @xmath160 probability ] .",
    "this might indicate that the gravitational interaction alone is not sufficient to describe the clustering of galaxies , and physical processes of gas and radiation hydrodynamics connected with galaxy formation must be taken into account . a positive bias , i.e. a biasing parameter @xmath161 , can reduce the 3pcf .",
    "but , perhaps this conclusion goes too far  in fact , a slightly higher shape parameter @xmath31 will give a better fit , because @xmath22 becomes smaller if @xmath31 is increased .",
    "it appears that a model with a new set of parameters is to be sought and the 3pcf determined here should provide to such new models a test in addition to the 2pcf and the pvd .",
    "the result is clear , and the conclusions are straightforward : we have succeeded in measuring the 3pcf from the lcrs .",
    "this is the first time that the three - point correlation function of galaxies has been measured accurately from a redshift survey .",
    "both the 3pcf in redshift space and the projected 3pcf have been measured as a function of the triangle size and shape with only a fractional uncertainty in each individual bin .",
    "various tests have been carried out to assure that the measurement is stable and that the errors are estimated reliably .",
    "our results indicate that the 3pcfs both in redshift space and in real space have small but significant deviations from the well - known hierarchical form .",
    "the 3pcf in the redshift space can be fitted by @xmath0v^2}$ ] for @xmath162 and @xmath2 , and the projected 3pcf by @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are in unit of @xmath8 ) .",
    "although it might be not unique to get 3-d real space @xmath12 from the measured projected function @xmath9 , we found that a half of the predicted @xmath12 of the cdm model considered in this paper provides a good description of the lcrs data .",
    "the three - point correlation function gives an additional statistical tool to constrain cosmogonic models .",
    "the general dependence of the 3pcf on triangle shape and size is in qualitative agreement with the cdm cosmogonic models .",
    "quantitatively the 3pcf of the models may depend on the biasing parameter and the shape of the power spectrum , in addition to other model parameters .",
    "taking our result together with the constraints imposed by the two - point correlation function and the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies also obtained from the lcrs , we find that we have difficulties to produce a _",

    ", the flat model with @xmath16 meets the 2pcf and pvd constraints , but gives higher values for the 3pcf than observed .",
