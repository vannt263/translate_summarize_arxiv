    "there is yet no procedure of smoothing an alexandrov s space even in a neighborhood of a regular point .",
    "maybe a more interesting question is whether smoothing is unique up to a diffeomorphism .",
    "if the answer is positive it would imply in particular that any riemannian manifold with curvature @xmath124 and @xmath1042 is diffeomorphic ( ! ) to the standard sphere , see @xcite for details .",
