    "they have been essential in tuning the parton showers and non - perturbative components of monte carlo event generators  @xcite and have also provided a laboratory for developing and testing analytical insight into the hadronisation process ( e.g. refs .",

    "additionally , they are one of the several tools that are used for classifying hadronic final states in new physics searches .",
    "the majority of investigations of event shapes has been performed for @xmath1 colliders , with significant work also in dis .",
    "a review of some of that work is given in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , few dedicated studies have been performed on them at hadron colliders , with a handful of measurements at the tevatron  @xcite , a pure fixed order study  @xcite , pure resummations in  @xcite , and a recent experimental simulation study by cms  @xcite , as well as some investigation of the use of event shapes applied to jet contents for the identification of hadronic decays of boosted massive particles @xcite ( other approaches are reviewed e.g.  in ref .",
    "the purpose of this article is to help bring our understanding of hadron - collider event - shape phenomenology closer to the level of sophistication that is standard in the @xmath1 and dis cases , concentrating specifically on event shapes in hard qcd ( dijet ) events .    as is well known from the @xmath1 and dis cases , accurate studies of event shapes",

    "fixed - order calculations provide expansions of event - shape distributions in powers of the strong coupling , @xmath0 .",

    "this compromises the convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "the enhanced terms can however be resummed to all orders , providing the dominant contribution to the distribution for @xmath4 .",

    "the lowest - order contribution to a dijet event consists of just two incoming and two outgoing partons . throughout the paper we refer to these qcd configurations as the `` born limit '' .",
    "many of the event shapes studied here were presented for the first time in  @xcite .",
    "all share the property of continuous globalness  @xcite , which is a necessary condition for being able to carry out a resummation to nll accuracy without a leading-@xmath17 approximation , and which also contributes to the simplicity of caesar s generalised resummation approach ( independently of the question of large-@xmath17 approximations ) . for an observable to be continuously global",
    ", it has to be sensitive to all emissions in an event ( this is the requirement of globalness ) , and moreover it should have definite scaling properties with respect to secondary emission s transverse momenta ( see sec .  [ sec : precaesar ] for a mathematical formulation ) .",
    "the continuously global event shapes we propose fall into three main classes : observables that are directly global , others that are supplemented with `` exponentially suppressed forward terms '' and observables with `` recoil terms '' .",
    "we first consider observables that are defined in terms of _ all _ hadrons in the event , therefore the name ` directly ' global .",
    "the * global transverse thrust * is defined as @xmath18 where the sum runs over all particles @xmath19 in the final state , @xmath20 represents the two momentum components transverse to the beam , @xmath21 its modulus , and @xmath22 is the transverse vector that maximises the sum .",
    "the observable which is resummed is then @xmath23 , which vanishes in the born limit .",
    "the normalization of event shape observables to a hard transverse scale of the event is important because it reduces uncertainties associated with the experimental jet - energy scale , which partially cancel between numerator and denominator  @xcite . for most event shapes ( except @xmath24 ) the choice of specific hard scale to which one normalises is arbitrary , and",
    "could for example also be the sum of the transverse momenta of the two hardest jets .",
    "the transverse thrust axis @xmath22 and the beam form the so - called event plane .",
    "one can then define a * directly global thrust minor * , which is a measure of the out - of - event - plane energy flow @xmath25 in close analogy with the @xmath1 case  @xcite , one can formulate a * transverse spher__o__city * : @xmath26 where the minimisation is carried over all possible unit transverse @xmath27-vectors @xmath28 . that provides",
    "the minimal sum always coincides with the transverse direction of one of the @xmath29 . ]",
    "this variable ranges from @xmath30 for pencil - like events , to a maximum of @xmath31 for circularly symmetric events .",
    "an alternative observable , which makes use of a linearised version of the transverse momentum tensor ( with direct analogy to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 parameters @xcite used in @xmath1 ) , is the * @xmath34-parameter * : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the two eigenvalues of @xmath37 .",
    "related variables have been considered in the plane transverse to the thrust axis in @xmath1 ( resummed for @xmath38-jet events in @xcite ) and in the plane transverse to a jet in the context of boosted top - quark decays @xcite , where forms involving the determinant of @xmath37 , e.g.  @xmath39 , have been used .",

    "if the smallest value is @xmath54 then particle @xmath55 is included in the beam and eliminated from the final state particles .",
    "if the smallest value is @xmath56 then particles @xmath55 and @xmath57 are recombined into a pseudoparticle ( jet ) .",
    "a number of recombination procedures exist .",

    "the procedure is repeated until only 3 pseudoparticles are left in the final state .",
    "+ the observable we resum is the * directly global three - jet resolution parameter * @xmath59 where @xmath60 is defined by further clustering the event until only two jets remain and taking @xmath60 as the sum of the two jet transverse momenta , @xmath61    while directly global event - shapes are defined in terms of all particles in the event , experimental measurements can be carried out only up to some given pseudorapidity @xmath62 ( @xmath63 at the tevatron and @xmath64 at the lhc ) .",
    "however , as long as the event - shape s value @xmath5 is not too small  @xcite , @xmath65 , one can safely neglect the contribution of hadrons beyond the rapidity cut .",
    "the value @xmath66 up to which a nll resummation is valid is observable specific .",
    "in particular , it depends on the behaviour of each event shape under a soft and collinear emission , as derived in  @xcite .",
    "further discussion is given in appendix  [ sec : appb ] .",
    "one way to address the difficulty in performing measurements near the beam is to define event - shapes using only particles in a central region and to add a term sensitive to emissions along the beam direction , so as to render them global , but with an exponential suppression in the forward or backward directions .",
    "we define the central region @xmath67 by requiring that the rapidity of particles in @xmath67 satisfies @xmath68 , where @xmath69 specifies the rapidity region in which the two highest @xmath70 jets should lie , and @xmath71 is a rapidity buffer around the jets of size @xmath72 .",
    "given the central region @xmath73 , we introduce the mean transverse - energy weighted rapidity @xmath74 of this region , @xmath75 and define the exponentially suppressed ( boost - invariant ) forward term as @xmath76 we can then define non - global variants of the event - shapes defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : dir - glob ] by restricting the sums to just the central region .",
    "for example , we have a * central transverse thrust * , @xmath77a * central thrust minor * @xmath78 and a * central three - jet resolution threshold * , @xmath79 defined by the algorithm of section  [ sec : dir - glob ] applied only to the final state particles in @xmath73 ( but maintaining the `` beam '' distance , eq .",

    "we obtain the * exponentially suppressed transverse thrust , thrust minor and three - jet resolution * , @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83    additionally , one can consider event - shapes which are more naturally defined using particles only in a restricted region , like jet - masses and broadenings . given a central transverse thrust axis @xmath84 , one can separate the central region @xmath73 into an up part @xmath85 consisting of all particles in @xmath73 with @xmath86 and a down part @xmath87 with @xmath88 respectively .",
    "one then defines , in analogy with @xmath1 @xcite , the normalised squared invariant masses of the two regions @xmath89 from which one can obtain a ( non - global ) * central sum of masses and heavy - mass * , @xmath90 and the corresponding global event - shapes , the * exponentially - suppressed sum of masses and heavy - mass * @xmath91    with the same division into up and down regions as for the jet masses , one can define jet broadenings . to do so in a boost - invariant manner ,",
    "one first introduces rapidities and azimuthal angles of axes for the up and down regions , @xmath92 and defines broadenings for the two regions , @xmath93 from which one can obtain * central total and wide - jet broadenings * , @xmath94 adding the forward term one obtains the global * exponentially - suppressed total and wide - jet broadenings * , @xmath95 we note that an observable that effectively has exponentially suppressed forward behaviour has also been studied in @xcite .      because of transverse momentum conservation ,",
    "if radiation is emitted in the forward region @xmath96 , recoil effects will cause the vector sum of the transverse momenta in the complementary , central region @xmath73 to be non - vanishing .",
    "it is then possible to exploit this effect to make observables ( continuously ) global , despite the fact that only a central subset of particles in the event effectively enters the definition of the event shapes .",
    "to do so , we add to the central event - shapes a suitable power of a recoil term , the two - dimensional vector sum of the transverse momenta in @xmath73 , @xmath97    we obtain than * recoil enhanced transverse thrust , thrust minor , three - jet resolution , sum- and heavy - jet masses , total and wide broadenings *    @xmath98      the event shapes discussed so far have all been defined in terms of the particles in the event .",
    "the experiments do nt measure particles directly .",
    "they do , however , have methods such as the combination of information from electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters into `` topoclusters '' ( atlas  @xcite ) and , with tracking , `` particle flow '' ( cms  @xcite ) , that provide inputs to jet algorithms that are quite close to particles .",
    "these same inputs would probably also be well suited to event - shape studies .    in uses of event",
    "shapes to cut on event topology in beyond - standard - model searches , as well as in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not particles but instead jets that have been used as inputs .",
    "the jets are usually defined through an angular resolution parameter @xmath47 ( as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dij_hh ] ) ) and a transverse momentum cutoff , which we will denote @xmath99 .",
    "one of the interests of using jets is that the @xmath99 cutoff eliminates much of the contamination from the underlying event , which can easily contribute @xmath100 of transverse momentum to the rapidity region covered by lhc detectors .    from the point of view of resummation , the use of jets as inputs poses two main problems .",
    "one comes from the presence of the new scale @xmath99 in the problem : in terms of the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 defining the event - shape s sensitivity to radiation along the incoming legs ( cf.table  [ tab : evshp - param ] and section  [ sec : precaesar ] ) , this new scale causes separate regions of event shape value to each involve different logarithmic structure : for cases with @xmath103 the potentially different regions are @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the first of these regions may be within the scope of caesarif @xmath107 is sufficiently small .",
    "a second problem is that of globalness .",
    "emissions collinear to any outgoing hard parton will be clustered together with its emitter to form a jet .",
    "the observable s sensitivity to these emissions will then depend on the jet recombination scheme . in the @xmath108-scheme , the current default at the tevatron and lhc ,",
    "the jet four - momentum is constructed by simply adding the four momenta of its constituents .",
    "therefore , all observables defined using transverse momenta will get no sensitivity to emissions inside each of the two hard jets , and will therefore be non - global .",
    "this statement is true for any recombination scheme that adds three - momenta vectorially . for variables with sensitivity to longitudinal degrees of freedom ,",
    "globalness can only be assessed on a case by case basis .",
    "for instance if one considers any global version of the total and heavy - jet mass ( with exponentially suppressed or recoil term ) , in the @xmath108-scheme the mass of each central hard jet will enter the hemisphere central jet mass @xmath109 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass - xc ] ) .",
    "therefore one obtains the same result for the central component of the event shape as would have been obtained using hadrons as inputs ( modulo the fact that the jet clustering may affect which particles are considered central ) .    one alternative to the use of jets as inputs , in order to avoid the globalness issue , is the following : use as inputs the particles that are inside the two hardest jets , together with all the remaining jet momenta .",
    "note that this does not eliminate the issue of the extra scales related to @xmath99 , though it does maintain the reduced sensitivity to underlying event that comes from the use of jets .",
    "typically one wishes to consider event shapes only for events that are sufficiently hard , requiring for example at least one jet above some minimum transverse momentum threshold @xmath110 and in some central rapidity region .",
    "we will denote this kind of hardness selection cut by a function @xmath111 of the @xmath112 particles in the event ; @xmath111 is equal to @xmath31 for events that pass the cuts and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "one can then define the cross section for events that pass the cuts , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the differential cross section for producing @xmath112 particles in some configuration @xmath115 .",
    "one can determine @xmath116 perturbatively as long as @xmath117 corresponds to an infrared and collinear ( irc ) safe selection procedure .",
    "one also defines the partial integrated cross section @xmath118 for events that pass the cut and for which additionally the event shape observable @xmath119 is smaller than some value @xmath5 , @xmath120 the differential normalised distribution for the event shape is then given by @xmath121 perturbatively we will write @xmath116 and @xmath118 as expansions in the number of powers of the coupling that they contain , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the leading order ( lo ) result , @xmath124 the nlo result , etc . ; @xmath125 is proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "we have chosen not to extract the powers of @xmath0 from the @xmath125 coefficients , because the scale of @xmath0 may depend on the kinematics of the events over which one has integrated .",
    "the expansion for @xmath118 is similar @xmath127 with the property that @xmath128 because the observable vanishes at @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 looks like a nlo term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - expansion ] ) , but it is usually determined from the lo @xmath131 term for the differential cross section of @xmath5 , @xmath132 the quantity @xmath133 is similarly determined from the nlo term of the differential cross section of @xmath5 . in the following we shall never use explicitly @xmath134 , since @xmath135 , the nnlo correction to the dijet cross section , has yet to be calculated and since its effect would lead to terms that are beyond our accuracy in differential distributions .",
    "resummations are relevant in the region of small @xmath5 , where logarithmically enhanced contributions of soft and collinear origin , as large as @xmath136 , appear at all orders in the integrated cross section @xmath118 , thus making fixed - order predictions unreliable .",
    "there is a large class of observables for which one can write a common `` master '' resummation formula , as was done in  @xcite , in order to sum such terms to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we will first examine what the class of observables is , and then review the broad structure of the resummation .      in order for an observable",
    "to be resummed within the caesarframework , its functional behaviour in the presence of an arbitrary number of soft and/or collinear emissions has to satisfy a number of conditions .",
    "these have been extensively discussed in  @xcite , and are checked automatically by caesargiven a computer subroutine that computes the value of the an observable given a set of four - momenta .",

    "a detailed study of the @xmath183 observable would benefit from comparisons of high jet - multiplicity qcd samples and multijet samples from new - physics scenarios .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper , but would , we believe , be of interest .",
    "given the length of the paper , and the fact that we have addressed quite a range of issues , we find it useful , before concluding , to summarise here the main results of the paper .",
    "there are a number of reason why event shapes provide a powerful laboratory for studying of a range of aspects of strong - interaction physics at hadron colliders . from an experimental point of view , cross sections for the qcd ( dijet ) events on which one carries out event - shape studies are very large both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "this means that high - statistics event samples are already available at the tevatron and can be expected early on at the lhc . since event shapes are defined as dimensionless ratios of combinations of hadron - momenta , and since their differential distributions are also dimensionless , many experimental uncertainties are reduced . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "one of the attractive characteristics of event - shape studies is that different variables provide complementary sensitivities to a broad variety of features of hadronic events , such as the topology of the final state , the nature of initial and final - state jet - fragmentation , hadronisation , and the underlying event .",
    "the above points motivated us to study many hadron - collider event shapes in a single context .",
    "we exploited the automated nll resummation procedure implemented in caesarto obtain next - to - leading logarithmic resummed distributions matched to next - to - leading order exact predictions from nlojet`++`for a large number of event shapes at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "the matching procedure is conceptually simple , but technically involved , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : matchnllnlo ] .",
    "one issue is that the best logarithmic accuracy achievable once nlo and nll predictions are available , namely @xmath185 in the expansion of the integrated distribution , nnll@xmath186 , can be obtained only if the nlo code provides full information about the flavour of all incoming and outgoing partons .",
    "this decomposition into flavour channels is not present in the publicly available version of nlojet`++ ` , so we used the extended version developed in @xcite in order to extract this information .",
    "we also needed to use the flavour-@xmath40 jet - algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite to map the flavour of @xmath187 events into that of an underlying @xmath188 born - like event .",
    "additionally we needed the order - by - order expansion of pdf evolution , which was provided by hoppet@xcite .",
    "the computing effort should also not be neglected : our directory of resummed results contains @xmath189 files , and we estimate that several tens of years of cpu time have gone into the nlo and nll calculations used here .",
    "part of this complexity stems from our choice to consider several different classes of uncertainties associated with uncalculated higher - order terms : those from separate variation of renormalisation and factorisation scales ; redefinition of the argument of the logarithm being resummed ( @xmath190-scale ) ; and two choices of schemes for combining ( matching ) the nlo and nll results .    among the questions we asked was whether this considerable complexity is needed .",
    "it turned out that the flavour decomposition had only a modest effect ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec : appa ] ) .",
    "we also found that a simple exponentiation of the nlo result , as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : naive - exp ] , not even correct to ll or ll@xmath186 accuracy , comes remarkably close to reproducing most of the nlo+nll distributions ( albeit not close enough that one would forgo nlo+nll if it is available ) .",
    "one interpretation is that the large amount of radiation that comes from the 4 born legs in a @xmath191 process causes event - shape distributions to be dominated by regions where the logarithm that is being resummed is not all that large .",
    "note , however , that plain ( unexponentiated ) nlo predictions are very inadequate substitutes for the full nll+nlo result and their uncertainty bands are misleadingly small .",
    "we studied three generic classes of event shapes : the directly global ones , those with exponentially suppressed terms and those with a recoil term .",
    "the definition of the observables is recaleld in sections .",
    "[ sec : dir - glob ] , [ sec : exp - obs ] , and [ sec : rec - obs ] respectively . while stable numerical results could be obtained for observables belonging to the first two classes , for the last of these it was sometimes impossible to obtain numerically sensible results .",
    "this is in part due to cancellations among contributions from multiple emissions in the recoil term , which cause the resummation provided by caesarto have a divergence at small @xmath5 , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : nll_resum ] .",
    "it is also due to structures in the middle of the physical region , akin to sudakov shoulders  @xcite , which would require an additional resummation .",
    "such shoulders are visible e.g. for the broadenings with recoil term in figs .",
    "[ fig : nllnlo - tev200 ] and  [ fig : nllnlo - lhc200 ] .",
    "these observables are also challenging experimentally because the measurement of the recoil term is affected by cancellations between large transverse momenta of the two hard jets .",
    "a question mark that hangs over nll resummations is that of coherence - violating logarithms ( cvl , referred to as super - leading logarithms ( slls ) in the context of interjet energy flow ) @xcite , terms potentially starting at @xmath192 , related to a violation of coherence , whose validity was a crucial assumption in the resummations of @xcite .",
    "there is a risk that this could therefore invalidate our claim of nll accuracy for some observables .",
    "we investigated this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : superl - logar ] , and found that the answer depends critically on the ordering parameter used in the calculation of the sll terms .",
    "if , as in @xcite , one makes the _ assumption _ that the ordering parameter is transverse momentum , then the claim of nll accuracy breaks down for our `` exponentially suppressed '' class of observable ( not for the others ) , while nnll@xmath186 remains valid for all observables . if one instead assumes virtuality ordering , then both nll and nnll@xmath186 accuracies should be valid for all our observables .",
    "this highlights the importance of understanding the question of ordering for slls , which also affects the coefficient of the @xmath193 terms in @xcite and probably requires that one go beyond the eikonal approximation that was used there .",
    "nevertheless , practically we tend to believe that slls will not seriously affect our results , one reason being that we still retain nnll@xmath186 accuracy .    turning to our phenomenological results ,",
    "a feature common to all observables is that the shape of the distributions is strongly influenced by the ratio of quarks to gluons among the incoming partons .",
    "this is because the double - logarithmic sudakov exponent , responsible for the position and width of the peak of the distribution for each underlying subprocess , is determined by the total color charge of the hard emitting partons .",
    "event samples dominated by gluon scattering ( tevatron with @xmath194 gev , lhc with @xmath195 gev ) have broader distributions than those dominated by quark scattering ( tevatron with @xmath195 gev , lhc with @xmath196 gev ) .",
    "this is evident e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ fig : different - energies ] in the case of our representative observable @xmath197 and is discussed in sec  [ sec : resnlomat ] .",
    "we remark that dijet event - shapes at hadron colliders are the first case in which a change in a kinematical cut modifies the double logarithmic behaviour of the event - shape distributions",
    ". this would not be the case for event shapes in hadron - collider processes such as drell - yan production , or @xmath198+jet or @xmath199+jet .    in the absence of data on the event shapes discussed here ,",
    "one of the interesting uses of our nll+nlo results is to compare them to the results of two monte carlo parton shower programs , this is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : partshow ] .",
    "we considered pythia 6.4 and herwig 6.5 both without and ( in the case of herwig ) with matching to multi - parton tree - level matrix elements ( alpgen , mlm prescription ) .",
    "the quality of the agreement between plain parton showers and the resummations depends significantly on the quark / gluon admixture : in quark - dominated event samples it is often adequate , while in gluon - dominated samples it is somewhat poorer .",
    "this may be a reflection of the extensive tuning of quark parton showers carried out with lep data , while gluon parton showers have seen fewer constraints .",
    "the importance of tuning parton showers in a context with incoming beams is highlighted particularly strongly by the results of the newer @xmath70-ordered shower in pythia 6.4 . in two tunes , s0a and pro - pt0 ,",
    "the agreement both with nlo+nll and with other showers is quite poor ; in the perugia0 tune it improves , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : y3g - pytunes ] .",
    "one might expect that supplementing parton showers with matching to multi - parton tree - level events ( tree+ps ) should improve the agreement with nlo+nll results .",
    "this is the case only for some of the observables .",
    "we also examined the impact of ( simultaneous ) renormalisation and factorisation scale variation on the tree+ps results and found that it leads to an uncertainty estimate that is far smaller than the actual differences between tree+ps and nlo+nll results , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : nll - v - alp - tev ] and  [ fig : nll - v - alp - lhc ] .",
    "this should not be surprising : in the nlo+nll calculations simultaneous scale variation represented only a small part of the full uncertainties .",
    "questions that remain open therefore are whether in the tree+ps approach uncertainties can be more faithfully estimated if one examines further `` handles '' ( independent scale variation , matching scale , etc . ) , and whether we would have reached similar conclusions with other matching schemes ( e.g.  ckkw ) and programs .    from a non - perturbative point of view , we estimated both hadronisation and ue  corrections using monte carlo event generators , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : study - np - effects ] .",
    "as expected , hadronisation corrections decrease when increasing the @xmath200-cut on the jets .",

    "they are therefore well suited for tunes of perturbative parameters of showers and in general for perturbative studies .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi - jet ] we examined how well event shapes can discriminate qcd - like two - jet events from bsm - like multi - jet events , and how robust this discriminating power is with respect to parton shower ( radiative ) corrections .",
    "in general we find that event - shapes discriminate well between events with two or more than two jets , but they do not discriminate well between three or any large number of jets : the value of event - shapes does not even increase monotonically with the number of jets for symmetric events , see fig .",
    "[ fig : circular - limit ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : simple - kinem - stud ] . on the other hand",
    "it is possible to design new event shapes , which start with six jets in the final state , as is the case for our `` supersphero '' @xmath183 event shape defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : evshp - spherical ] .",
    "we believe these might be particularly promising for extracting new - physics signals that involve relatively isotropic events with high jet multiplicity . other considerations that we examined in sec .

    "[ sec : spheri ] is particularly poor in this respect ) ; and also their sensitivity not just to transverse event structure , but also to longitudinal event structure ( the broadenings do well at treating both on an equal footing ) .",
    "in this article we have shown the first nlo+nll ( nnll@xmath186 ) predictions , with full uncertainty bands , for hadronic observables at @xmath15 and @xmath13 colliders .",
    "we opted to make these predictions for event shapes in the context of dijet production , bringing together calculations with caesarand a specially adapted version of nlojet`++ ` , despite the fact that the nlo+nll matching is technically more challenging than for event shapes in other hadron - collider processes such as drell - yan @xcite or w / z+jet @xcite production .",
    "several properties of the dijet process motivated our choice : it involves both initial and final - state partons ; it offers the freedom to vary the proportion of quarks and gluons involved in the born process , through the cut on the hard jets ; when that cut is placed at moderate @xmath70 , dijet production involves a substantial @xmath206 scattering component , offering the most accessible example of a gluon - dominated process ; and the cross sections imply large event samples .",
    "comparisons of our results with parton - shower monte carlo predictions revealed adequate agreement for historic showers ( herwig 6.5 , virtuality - ordered pythia 6.4 ) in quark - dominated cases , while the showers were generally too hard in gluon - dominated processes .",
    "some common tunes of the newer , @xmath70-ordered shower in pythia 6.4 fared noticeably worse than the historic showers .",
    "we also examined one framework for matching to multi - parton tree - level matrix elements ( mlm matching of alpgen+herwig 6.5 ) . though it led to some improvements",
    ", it was not immediately sufficient to bring about systematic agreement with the nlo+nll results .",
    "these findings illustrate how event shapes can provide substantial input to the quest of understanding perturbative qcd at hadron colliders .    at hadron level , some event shapes are subject to significant non - perturbative corrections from hadronisation and the underlying event .",
    "we saw this to be the case , for example , for the thrusts and jet masses , while other observables , notably the @xmath207 variants , were largely unaffected by non - perturbative effects . studying a broad range of event shapes , as done here ,",
