    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) originate from the most luminous explosions in the universe and more than 35 years after their discovery in 1967 @xcite , many questions remain to be answered about their possible progenitors , the composition of the ultra - relativistic outflows that power them , and the dominant emission mechanism for their prompt gamma rays .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ; 1991 - 2000 ) made significant advances to the field , thoroughly exploring the 25  kev  2  mev energy range with detailed population studies of the prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "burst spectra were found to be well described by the band function @xcite , which consists of two smoothly connected power laws .",
    "it was understood , however , that observations of grbs at higher energies were of crucial importance to resolve some of the open issues : constrain the bulk lorentz factor of the outflow and the distance from the central source to the gamma - ray emission region , distinguish between hadronic and leptonic origins of the gamma - ray emission , and probe for signatures of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) which could be accelerated within grb jets ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of the prospects for grb science with fermi lat ) .",
    "constraints on the origin of the high - energy emission from grbs are quite limited due to both the small number of bursts with firm high - energy detection and the small number of events that were detected in such cases .",
    "high - energy emission from grbs was first observed by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret , covering the energy range from @xmath0mev to @xmath0gev ) onboard cgro .",
    "emission above @xmath1mev was detected in five cases : grbs  910503 , 910601 , 930131 , 940217 and 940301 @xcite .",
    "one of these sources , grb  930131 , had high - energy emission that was consistent with an extrapolation from its spectrum obtained with batse between 25  kev  4  mev  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , evidence for an additional high - energy component up to @xmath2mev with a different temporal behavior to the low - energy component was discovered in grb  941017 ( in egret s calorimeter tasc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the high - energy emission for the latter grb lasted more than 200 seconds with a single spectral component being ruled out .",
    "a unique aspect of the high - energy emission in grb  940217 was its duration , which lasted up to @xmath3@xmath4 minutes after the batse grb trigger , including an 18 gev photon at @xmath3@xmath5 minutes post - trigger @xcite .",
    "more recently , the grid instrument onboard astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile ) detected 10 high - energy events with energies up to @xmath6mev from grb 080514b , in coincidence with its lower energy emission , with a significance of @xmath7 @xcite .    the fermi gamma - ray space telescope was launched on june 11 2008 and provides an unprecedented energy coverage and sensitivity for the study of high - energy emission in grbs .",
    "it is composed of two instruments : the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gbm covers the entire unocculted sky with 12 sodium iodide ( nai ) detectors with different orientation placed around the spacecraft and covering an energy range from 8 kev to 1 mev , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillators placed on opposite sides of the spacecraft with energy coverage from 200 kev to 40 mev .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion telescope made up of @xmath8 arrays of silicon strip trackers and cesium iodide calorimeter modules covered by a segmented anti - coincidence detector designed to efficiently reject charged particles .",
    "the energy coverage of the lat instrument ranges from 20 mev to more than 300  gev with a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath3@xmath9 steradians .",
    "note that the lat effective area is still non - zero even as far out as 70 degrees off - axis which allows the detection of bursts with such high incident angles .",
    "as of june 1 2009 , 9 grbs have been detected by the lat at energies above 100  mev : grb  080825c @xcite , grb  080916c @xcite , grb  081024b @xcite , grb  081215a @xcite , grb  090217 @xcite , grb  090323 @xcite , grb  090328 @xcite , grb  090510 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report the observations and analyses of gamma - ray emission from grb  080825c , the first grb detected by both the gbm and the lat instruments .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] will present the gbm and lat observations along with the various methods used for data analysis , section [ sec : dataana ] provides the results of detailed time - resolved spectroscopy , and section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the theoretical interpretation of our observations and compares the properties of this event to the ones observed in some other lat grbs .",
    "at 14:13:48 utc on august 25 2008 ( @xmath10 ) , grb  080825c triggered the gbm flight software  ( trigger 241366429 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on - ground analysis of the gbm data localized the burst at right ascension ( ra , j2000 ) = 232.2@xmath11 , declination ( dec , j2000 ) = -4.9@xmath11 , with a statistical uncertainty of 1.5@xmath11 at the @xmath12-@xmath13 confidence level .",
    "the gbm on - ground localization placed this grb at @xmath3@xmath14 from the lat boresight at the time of the trigger , at the edge of the lat fov , where the effective area is a factor of @xmath3@xmath15 less than on axis .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ lightcurves ] show the background subtracted light curves ( see section [ sec : specana ] ) of the two brightest nai detectors ( 9 & 10 ) and of the two bgo detectors .",
    "the grb exhibits a multiple peak structure with the two brightest peaks seen right after onset .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 durations of the event ( time during which 90% and 50% of the event flux was collected , cf . * ? ? ? * ) were estimated to be ( 8 - 1000  kev ) @xmath3@xmath18s and @xmath3@xmath19s , respectively .",
    "emission in the nai and bgo detectors becomes extremely weak after @xmath3@xmath20s .",
    "however , emission is detected in the nai scintillators up to @xmath3@xmath21s after the trigger time with a @xmath22 significance in bin ( e ) .",
    "the lat events detected close to the gbm position around the trigger time are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ lightcurves ] ( see details below ) .",
    "the lat data show a count rate increase that is spatially and temporally correlated with the gbm emission . we have performed a detailed analysis of the significance of this detection .",
    "details on this computation as well as of the lat data selection , background estimation and localization are given below .",
    "most of the events detected by the lat instrument are cosmic rays that need to be distinguished from any source of @xmath23-ray signal .",
    "the broad range of lat observations and analyses , from grbs to extended diffuse radiation , leads to different optimizations of the event selections which have different rates of residual backgrounds ( misclassified cosmic rays ) .",
    "the lat background rejection analysis has been constructed to allow analysis classes to be optimized for specific science topics @xcite . in the case of grb observations ,",
    "the relatively small region of the sky as well as the very short time window allow the background rejection cuts to be relaxed relative to an analysis of a diffuse source covering a large portion of the sky over longer periods of time . indeed , the so - called ` diffuse ' event class is most suited for studying faint sources ( like diffuse gamma - ray emission ) with minimum background contamination . in the case of grb",
    "080825c , it was used to search for possible high - energy afterglow emission up to 13  ks after the burst trigger ( see section [ sec : afterglow ] ) . on shorter timescales ,",
    "a significant improvement in signal - to - noise ratio can be obtained by increasing the effective area while keeping the background rate at a reasonable level .",
    "the so - called transient event class was developed for this specific purpose and is used for burst detection and localization .    using monte - carlo simulations as well as real data input , the event selection used for spectral",
    "analysis has been optimized compared to previous analyses @xcite that uses the transient class for the prompt emission analysis . indeed",
    ", we found that cuts can be loosened even further for typical burst duration since background contamination is less of an issue for short time windows .",
    "for this purpose , a more relaxed event class , so - called s3 , has been developed to improve the lat effective area at the expense of an increase in background rate .",
    "pure effective area increase is on the order of @xmath330 % at 100 mev and @xmath310% at 1 gev . for a typical grb spectrum , the gamma efficiency above 80 mev increases by a factor of 20% when using the s3 class ( with a small dependence on spectral index and incidence angle ) when the all - sky - background rate increases from @xmath34.2 hz ( transient ) to @xmath35.2 hz ( s3 ) .",
    "our study showed that s3 brings improvement over the ` transient ' class in terms of signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath24 ) above 80 mev .",
    "this improvement depends on the brightness of the burst and is of the order of 15% for bursts with grb 080825c characteristics . as a consequence",
    ", the s3 event class was used for the spectral analysis of grb 080825c . note that the lower energy threshold does not add any additional systematics compared to the previously used 100 mev threshold ( see section  [ sec : specana ] ) .",
    "finally , the event selection makes use of the spatial information around the best lat localization .",
    "the lat point - spread - function ( psf ) has a strong dependence with energy as well as with the conversion point in the tracker .",
    "lat events are thus separated into front ( conversion in the upper part of the tracker ) and back ( conversion in the lower part of the tracker ) events @xcite for which separate response functions are provided .",
    "the region of interest ( roi ) considered in this analysis is energy dependent and based on the @xmath25 containment radius ( @xmath26 ) and the 95% lat error localization ( @xmath27 ) :    @xmath28    to avoid large background contamination , a maximum size is set at 10 and 12 deg for front and back events respectively . in the particular case of grb 080825c : @xmath29 is set to this maximum size and @xmath30 degrees for front and back events respectively .",
    "all events resulting from this selection process are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ lightcurves ] .",
    "since the number of events detected by the lat is only 15 ( of which 13 have an energy @xmath3180  mev and can can be used for spectral analysis ) , we need to carefully estimate the expected number of background events in order to calculate the statistical significance of our measurements .",
    "the background in the lat data used for this analysis is dominated by cosmic rays ( crs ) , with a small contribution from extragalactic and galactic diffuse gamma rays . because the earth s limb was @xmath385  deg from the grb location",
    ", the contamination from earth - albedo events was negligible and consisted of events with very poorly reconstructed directions .",
    "the background rate is a function of many parameters and can vary by more than a factor of two , depending on the observational conditions .",
    "for example , there is a strong dependence of the cr background rate on the geomagnetic coordinates at the location of the spacecraft .",
    "furthermore , the background rate also depends on the burst position in instrument coordinates , because the lat s acceptance varies strongly with the inclination angle .",
    "for these reasons , it is not straightforward to estimate the expected amount of background during the grb emission using off - source regions around the trigger time , since the spacecraft will have moved to regions of different geomagnetic coordinates , and the inclination angle of the region of interest will have changed significantly .",
    "all these effects are properly taken into account to estimate the background rate for our specific observational conditions .    because the two background components ( crs and gamma rays ) have different properties , they are estimated separately using two different methods .",
    "the amount of gamma - ray background from some direction in the celestial sphere depends only on the accumulated exposure in that particular direction .",
    "therefore , this component can be estimated by simply scaling the number of gamma rays detected in six months of lat data , produced during normal science operations , by the ratio of the exposure of the grb observation over the exposure of the six - month data set .",
    "similarly to the above , the amount of cr background from some direction in the celestial sphere depends on the exposure in that direction . however , unlike the above , the cr background also depends on the geomagnetic coordinates at the location of the spacecraft at each instant of the observation .",
    "because of the latter dependence , the cr background can not be calculated the same way as the gamma - ray background . instead",
    ", a monte carlo simulation of the grb observation is performed , in which parameterizations of the dependence of the cr background rate on the geomagnetic coordinates and on the inclination angle are used to estimate it for each second of the observation .",
    "these two methods will be described in detail below .",
    "the cr - background estimation was based on properties of the lat data extracted from a subset of six months of data selecting when the galactic plane was far from the center of the lat s fov ( @xmath32 ) . during such observations , and for the transient and s3 data classes ,",
    "the gamma - ray contribution to the detected signal is negligible , and the detected events can be approximated as being cosmic rays .",
    "specifically , for the transient class the gamma - ray contamination in this subset of the data is about 10% , which consists of comparable amounts of galactic and extragalactic diffuse emissions and a negligible contribution from resolved point sources . for the s3 class ,",
    "the gamma - ray contamination is comparable , although slightly lower . after extracting the dependence of the cr - background rate on the geomagnetic",
    "coordinates at the position of the spacecraft , we used this dependence to calculate the all - sky cr - background rate for each second of the grb observation .",
    "then , a corresponding number of simulated events were generated with directions in instrument - centered coordinates , off - axis @xmath33 and azimuthal angle @xmath34 , selected to match the observed distribution in the same subset of the six months of lat data as used above .",
    "these coordinates were then converted to equatorial coordinates , using the instrument s pointing information and were added to a skymap .",
    "the simulation procedure described above was repeated hundreds of millions of times .",
    "the individual skymaps generated at each one of the iterations were then averaged to obtain a single skymap that showed the expected amount of cr background from each direction of the celestial sphere for the specific grb observation .",
    "as mentioned above , the gamma - ray component of the background was estimated by rescaling the number of gamma rays detected during six months of lat data ( without applying a cut on the galactic latitude of the lat pointing direction this time ) .",
    "first , a cr background map corresponding to the six - month period was created by following the procedure mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "then , an all - particle ( both crs and gamma rays ) map was filled with the directions of all the events actually detected by the lat during the six - month period .",
    "then , the estimated cr - background map was subtracted from that all - particle six - month map to produce a residual map that was assumed to contain only gamma rays .",
    "the number of gamma rays detected during the grb observation was then calculated by scaling the residual map with the ratio of the exposures of the two periods ( six months exposure over grb - observation exposure ) .",
    "the procedures of estimating the cr and gamma - ray components of the background described above were repeated for 40 different energy ranges spaced logarithmically from 20  mev to 300  gev . for each energy range , the cr - background estimations used a different dependence of the cr - background rate on the geomagnetic coordinates , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 distributions . similarly , the gamma - ray background estimations used different instrument - response functions for the exposure calculations .",
    "the resulting cr and gamma - ray maps were then added to produce all - particle estimated - background maps ( one for each energy range ) .",
    "the new maps were then integrated over the energy - dependent regions of interest to produce the final all - particle background estimates .",
    "the all - sky fraction of gamma - rays in the background appears consistent with the @xmath32 gamma - ray fraction , such that it contributes @xmath35 towards the overall background rate .",
    "the results of this method were tested against actual lat data for a variety of durations , locations in the celestial sphere , energies , and data classes .",
    "all the distributions of the ratios of the estimated over the actually - detected signals followed a gaussian distribution , with width about 15% and center zero ( no systematic over- or under - estimation of the background ) .",
    "this accuracy did not depend on the direction of the region of interest ( e.g. its distance from the galactic plane ) and did not have a strong dependence ( @xmath36@xmath37 ) on the observation s duration .      using the ` transient ' event selection in an energy - dependent analysis region centered around the gbm best localization and no energy selection , we find 15 events ( @xmath38 ) between @xmath10 and @xmath39 s ( time interval where we find significant emission in the nai detectors ) . from the background estimate ( section 2.2.2 ) , the expected number of counts in the same region and time interval is @xmath40 .",
    "the gamma - ray contribution to the background estimate for this particular burst was about @xmath41 . in order to assess carefully the significance of this observation , we have used 4 independent statistical methods which are described below .",
    "the first method uses an unbinned likelihood analysis of the lat data which takes into account the energy - dependent psf in an event - by - event basis .",
    "this method finds a significance of 6.5 comparable to the significances found with more simple counting methods described below .",
    "this is due to the fact that our selected events have fairly large psf and thus spatial information within our roi is not that constraining . in the case of grbs",
    "where high energy events have been detected , this method is expected to provide the highest significance since it fully takes into account the spatial information for each event .",
    "the second method computes the probability of the null hypothesis being true ( the probability that the observed number of counts in the on - source region is due to a background fluctuation ) in a frequentist approach that treats the background uncertainty in a semi - bayesian way @xcite .",
    "given a certain estimated number of background counts b during the on - source interval , we compute what is the probability of the actual on - source measurement @xmath38 being consistent with this value .",
    "@xmath42 expresses the probability of the on - source measurement being equal or superior to @xmath38 when only statistical fluctuations are considered :    @xmath43    because of systematic uncertainties in the background estimation method , each possible value for the number of background counts is weighted using a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath44 and a standard deviation of @xmath45 ( since we estimate our systematics to be about 15% ) : @xmath46 .",
    "we then integrate over all the possible values of b to compute a weighted probability :    @xmath47    we applied this method for the numbers mentioned above : @xmath48 events , @xmath40 , and we obtained a null - hypothesis probability of @xmath49 , which corresponds to a significance of @xmath50 .",
    "the third method is fully bayesian .",
    "the question of whether a grb is detected by the lat is analyzed as an on - source / off - source observation in the time domain .",
    "for the on - source observation the same parameters are used as in the classical ( frequentist ) analysis , @xmath51 33.0 s of live time ( corresponding to a clock time of 35.5 s ) and @xmath5215 . because the inclination angle of the best source position with respect to the instrument boresight moved slowly in a 565 s interval around the burst trigger ( with @xmath53 525.0 s of live time ) , we could provide an estimate of the off - source background rate . during this interval",
    "there were @xmath54 19 counts detected , and the corresponding rate is consistent with the previous background estimate @xmath44 .",
    "the spacecraft motion was favorable for grb  080825c , allowing an unusually long off - source interval to determine the background rate .",
    "for some other grbs , spacecraft motion may cause the background in the lat to vary more quickly , limiting the time for which an off - source interval measures the same background as that of the on - source interval , and therefore limiting the applicability of this method .",
    "the bayesian method assumes that the counts during the background interval are due to a poissonian process with rate @xmath55 . to evaluate the probability that a source has been detected during the on - source interval ,",
    "the method compares two hypotheses for the poisson rate during the on - source interval : that observed counts are due to the same background rate @xmath55 , or that they are due to a background plus source rate @xmath56 .",
    "this second hypothesis is insufficiently specified to quantitatively solve the problem : one must specify some plausible range for the source rate @xmath57 using prior data ( i.e. , not using the lat observations ) .",
    "we produce a reasonable estimate for the lat source counts by extrapolating the time - integrated spectral fit of the gbm data to the lat energy range . the photon model from the gbm fit",
    "is propagated through the lat response to predict the number of lat counts .",
    "a real lat observation could have a smaller value than this estimate because of a statistical fluctuation , or because of a spectral break between the gbm and lat energy range .",
    "alternatively , a real lat observation could actually exceed this estimate for the maximum rate if there were an additional and distinct spectral component to the one found with the gbm data alone .",
    "nevertheless , this is a reasonable ` prior ' estimate for the maximum counts expected in the lat , which for grb 082525c is @xmath3@xmath58 counts . under the assumptions",
    "described , both @xcite and @xcite give analytic solutions for the probability @xmath59 that the source is detected . using the observational parameters listed above",
    ", we find @xmath60 which corresponds to a @xmath61 significance .",
    "moreover , this method can provide the probabilities for the number of events actually originating from the source : all 15 events ( 30% ) , 14 events ( 35% ) , 13 events ( 22% ) , 12 events ( 9% ) , 11 events ( 3% ) , @xmath6210 events ( 1% ) .",
    "finally we have computed the significance with a fully frequentist method using the on - source / off - source approach as described by ( equation ( 17 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "this method yields a significance of 6.4 @xmath13 for the detecting this burst .",
    "it should be noted that because such search for lat excess is performed on all grbs triggered by the gbm and other instruments ( when the burst is in the lat fov ) , it is important to consider multi - trials in our analysis . for independent searches as",
    "is the case here , the post - trials probability threshold for obtaining a @xmath63 result is @xmath64 where n is the number of trials and @xmath65 the @xmath63 probability threshold for a single search ( @xmath66 ) . in the case of grb 080825c , we searched for lat excess in @xmath350 bursts triggered by the gbm which corresponds to a post - trial probability for a @xmath63 results of @xmath67 .",
    "this corresponds to a significance of 5.7 which is therefore our threshold for a @xmath63 detection .",
    "the four independent significance computations presented above all yield consistent results similar or above this threshold .",
    "grb  080825c is therefore the first grb detected by the lat instrument @xcite at a high significance level .      due to the strong variation of the lat psf with photon energy @xcite",
    ", the on - ground localization of a source depends strongly on its spectral shape .",
    "for example , 10 photons detected at 100 mev will yield an accuracy of @xmath3@xmath68 , while one single photon with an energy of 10 gev will increase the accuracy to @xmath3@xmath69 .",
    "the on - ground localization procedure makes use of the ` transient ' class events .",
    "it is restricted to the events detected above 100 mev ( which have a good psf ) in a @xmath70 region around the gbm trigger position ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "the method is based on a likelihood ratio test , following the same steps as @xcite . while these authors used a binned likelihood for the analysis of egret data , our likelihood function is unbinned and uses the instrument psf on an event basis .",
    "it also takes into account the various residual backgrounds .",
    "first , the position of the source and its spectrum are left free in the fit , assuming a power - law shape . then , in order to compute an accurate localization error , the test - statistics ( ts , see section [ sec : afterglow ] for a complete definition ) of the point source spectral fit is computed at each node of a fine map ( @xmath73 for this case , with a bin size of @xmath69 ) . following @xcite , the ts values are interpreted in terms of the chi - squared distribution with two degrees of freedom ( the two map coordinates ) . figure  [ figloccl ] shows the obtained error contours around the fitted position @xmath74 , @xmath75 , with a 68% , 90% and 99% statistical error radius of 0.8@xmath11 , 1.3@xmath11 and 2.0@xmath11 , respectively .    at large inclination angles , the systematic error of a source localization with the lat",
    "is dominated by the slight bias in direction reconstruction of low - energy photons .",
    "this bias is mainly caused by a trigger effect , which selects those events that scatter downwards and interact with at least three tracker planes , as required by the instrument trigger logic @xcite .",
    "the bias is amplified by the reconstruction efficiency , which is larger for tracks near normal incidence .",
    "since the psf is assumed to be centered on average on the true directions of the gamma rays , this effect translates to a bias in the fitted position towards smaller inclination angle .",
    "this systematic error has been evaluated in two steps , using both data and monte - carlo simulations . in the first step",
    ", we studied the lat performance in localizing the vela pulsar , which is the brightest source and has a well - determined position from observations at other wavelengths .",
    "we found that the fitted position obtained from observations where this source was seen at large inclination angles , is biased towards smaller angles .",
    "this bias is noticeable only when low - energy events ( below 1  gev ) are used and it disappears when high - energy events ( above 1  gev ) are included in the analysis . the agreement found with the prediction of the monte - carlo simulation allows us to evaluate the bias for any burst observation .",
    "for instance , figure  [ figbiasvse ] shows how the bias varies with energy range for a bright gamma - ray point source with the same spectral index and inclination angle as grb  080916c @xcite .    in the second step , we used the monte - carlo simulation to evaluate the localization systematic error for grb  080825c .",
    "we produced a simulation of a point source with the same spectral index ( @xmath3@xmath76 ) and inclination angle as grb  080825c ( @xmath3@xmath14 ) .",
    "the position obtained with events between 100  mev and 570  mev showed a deviation of @xmath3@xmath77 with respect to the input position .",
    "this systematic error is larger than the one derived for the very bright grb  080916c ( @xmath78@xmath69 ) because grb  080825c occurred at a larger inclination angle and had a maximum photon energy well below 1  gev .",
    "the nai , bgo and lat ( s3 selection ) light curves are shown in figure  [ lightcurves ] . no lat event is seen in coincidence with the first bright gbm peak .",
    "the first 3 lat events above 80 mev are detected in a very short time window , a few seconds after the gbm trigger , in coincidence with the second gbm peak .",
    "after a quiet period where no lat events are detected up to @xmath3@xmath79s , 4 more events are detected within the gbm @xmath16 , and another 4 events after @xmath16 when the nai emission has faded close to background level .",
    "interestingly the highest energy event , with an energy of @xmath80  mev , is detected at @xmath3@xmath81s .    to quantify the different features of this grb ( lat delay , gap , and extended emission ) , we have performed monte - carlo simulations of the lat light curve and estimated the fraction of those simulations that reproduce these features .",
    "the lat event distribution was produced using poisson statistics for a constant background rate of 0.037@xmath82hz ( see section [ sec : background ] ) , an estimated detected signal above @xmath83mev of 11.7 events ( 13 events minus 1.3 estimated background events ) and a temporal probability distribution based on the nai light curve from @xmath10 to @xmath84s .",
    "the probability of the different features were computed as follow :    * delay : the fraction of simulated light curves where the first event arrives later than the first actual observed photon ( at @xmath85 s ) . *",
    "gap : the fraction of simulated light curves which include a gap in the middle of the light curve with a width larger than the 12.38 s observed . * extended emission : the fraction of simulated light curves where the last 5 events are detected after the timing of the ninth observed event ( detected at @xmath86 s ) .",
    "this analysis finds weak evidence for the possible delay or gap features ( with chance probabilities of 3.4% and 0.89% , respectively ) , but the evidence for temporally extended emission in the lat is more significant , at a 3.7@xmath87 level .",
    "we searched for possible afterglow emission up to 13  ks after the trigger time , but did not find any significant emission .",

    "the high - energy exponential cutoff was implemented by multiplying the original spectrum by @xmath97 .",
    "the main results of our combined gbm and lat analysis are shown in tables  [ tab : spectres ] ( spectral parameters ) and [ tab : fluxfluence ] ( flux and fluence in 50  300 kev and 100  600 mev ) , for which we used the lat data and responses obtained with the ` s3 ' cut . the time - integrated spectrum ( shown in figure  [ intspectrum ] ) and the time bins ( b ) to ( d ) are best fit to a significant degree by the band function , and thus only the best fit parameters and associated statistical uncertainties of the band function are provided in table  [ tab : spectres ] for these time bins .",
    "the best fit parameters for the band function are also given for time bin ( a ) , although an addition of a possible exponential cutoff is discussed later in this section .",
    "for time interval ( e ) , however , the spectrum is adequately described by a single power law , and adding more parameters does not improve the fit . adding a power law function to the band function",
    "does not improve the time - integrated and time - resolved fits .",
    "besides spectral fits to the whole gbm & lat energy range , we also fitted the gbm data alone and propagated the photon model from the gbm fit through the lat response to obtain the predicted numbers of lat counts .",
    "a comparison between the expected and observed numbers of events shows that there is no need for an extra emission component besides the band function ( or power law for time bin ( e ) ) .",
    "time bins ( a ) to ( d ) display the typical hard - to - soft evolution of @xmath98 @xcite , which is the energy at which the band function peaks in @xmath99 spectrum , starting at almost 300  kev and decreasing to @xmath3@xmath100kev . except for the second interval ,",
    "the values of the low - energy spectral index , @xmath101 , and the high - energy spectral index , @xmath102 , are constant within their uncertainties .",
    "the evolution of the spectral parameters , flux , fluence , and the flux ratio between the two energy ranges , are shown in figure  [ paramfluxfluence ] .",
    "the best - fit model spectra for time bins ( a ) to ( e ) are shown in figure  [ fig : multy_spec ] along with their @xmath103 confidence intervals .",
    "a significant hardening of the spectrum at high energy is observed after @xmath3@xmath104 sec . from the light curves ( figure  [ lightcurves ] ) it is clear that while the gbm emission in time bin ( e ) is just above the background level , there is significant emission in the lat , including the two highest energy events detected for this grb .",
    "this spectral hardening is also reflected in the power - law index of @xmath105@xmath106@xmath107 for time bin ( e ) ( see table  [ tab : spectres ] ) , which is significantly harder than the values of @xmath102 in the earlier time bins .",
    "looking at the evolution of @xmath98 , one could argue that the spectrum is affected by curvature at the low - energy end and that a band function is not preferred over a single power law due to poor statistics .",
    "however , a spectral fit in interval ( e ) of all the data above 300  kev gives a softer but consistent power - law index of @xmath108@xmath109@xmath110 .",
    "this @xmath102-value is closer to the @xmath102-values found for interval ( a ) to ( d ) , but still significantly harder .",
    "we have searched for possible departures from a simple band function in the different time bins by performing a likelihood ratio test comparing a simple band function with a band function multiplied by an exponential cutoff term , @xmath97 .",
    "a significance of @xmath111 was found for an exponential cutoff in time bin ( a ) with a cutoff energy around @xmath112 mev ( with following band function parameters : @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 kev ) .",
    "we investigated the dependence of this significance with the systematics of our instruments and found the strongest effect to be a @xmath116 variation in the bgo effective area which can bring the significance down to @xmath3@xmath117 . with 5 time bins ,",
    "this is not strong enough to claim the existence of an exponential cutoff .",
    "we have performed a careful investigation of the effect of systematic uncertainties on the spectral parameters of grb  080825c .",
    "we considered the following systematics in the lat , bgo and nai detectors : effective area , energy dispersion and background subtraction .",
    "for the lat the methodology we use is to modify the instrument response functions ( irfs ) in order to take into account those various effects .",
    "systematics on the lat effective area have been derived from a study of the vela pulsar and earth albedo photons because it is possible in both cases to extract an extremely pure gamma - ray sample .",
    "using this sample , the uncertainty on the lat effective area has been computed as a function of energy to be 10% below 100 mev , 5% around 1 gev and 20% above 10 gev .",
    "based on this estimate , some special irfs have been created to encompass the extreme scenarios in overall normalization and slope of the lat effective area . the uncertainty in energy measurement for the lat is estimated to be of the order of 5% .",
    "we adopted a 10% uncertainty in the nai and bgo effective area ( both overall normalization and slope ) .",
    "finally we also considered the uncertainty in the choice of off - timing sample for nai and bgo background subtraction and found the corresponding systematics to be negligible . in each time bin , the error values on the spectral parameters are found to be similar to or smaller than the statistical uncertainties reported in table  [ tab : spectres ] , except for the case of time bin ( a ) and ( b ) where the systematics on @xmath118 and the normalization are found to be about two times and three times larger , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : sys ] reports the systematics found for each parameter of the time - integrated best fit band function reported in table  [ tab : spectres ] as well as the predominant systematic effects .",
    "we note that similar trends for the systematic uncertainties were found for grb  080916c @xcite , which had many more lat events than grb  080825c .",
    "grb  080825c is the first grb detected by the fermi lat .",
    "furthermore , it is the first grb to show a hint of a time delay between the onset of the high - energy ( @xmath119mev ) emission relative to the low - energy ( sub - mev ) emission ( later seen much more clearly in grb  080916c ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , there appears to be a local minimum in the high - energy flux between the initial narrow ( @xmath120s ) lat spike , at @xmath3@xmath121s after the gbm trigger , and the later , much broader peak ( between @xmath3@xmath79s and @xmath3@xmath122s ) .",
    "grb  080825c is the first grb to show this possible feature in the high - energy emission .",
    "the late broad peak in the high - energy emission has a duration comparable to its peak time as measured from the grb trigger time , and these two timescales are also similar to the duration of the low - energy emission ( which has @xmath123s and @xmath124s ) .",
    "the fact that these three timescales are comparable is naturally accounted for if this late broad peak signifies the onset of the emission from the external ( reverse or forward ) shocks , if the reverse shock is ( at least mildly ) relativistic ( see figure  1 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this occurs around the deceleration time , as the grb outflow is decelerated by a reverse shock while it drives a highly - relativistic forward shock into the external medium . in this scenario",
    "the late broad lat peak can be either synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from the reverse shock or external - compton ( ec ) emission from the forward - reverse shock system that forms as the grb outflow is decelerated by the external medium ( as was suggested for grb  941017 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case",
    "the seed synchrotron photons can come from the reverse shock and the upscattering relativistic electrons from the forward shock , or vice versa @xcite .    in time",
    "bin ( e ) , which contains the second half of the broad high - energy lat peak while the gbm emission is almost back to background , the spectrum is well fit by a single power law with a photon index of @xmath125 , which is significantly harder than the values of the high - energy photon index @xmath102 in all of the earlier time bins .",
    "moreover , the two highest energy photons in this grb are in time bin ( e ) .",
    "this may suggest that the late time wide high - energy peak arises from a separate spectral component to that responsible for the low - energy emission , which is consistent with an origin from a distinct physical region ( and in particular with an external shock origin , as mentioned above ) . if there is still some contribution from the low - energy spectral component , then the photon index of the high - energy spectral component , which dominates in time bin ( e ) but is sub - dominant earlier on , could be somewhat harder than the measured value .",
    "a rather flat @xmath126 spectrum around @xmath3@xmath1mev might suggest that the peak photon energy of this spectral component is close to this energy range , which may be readily obtained for ssc from the reverse shock , and possibly for the ec process described above .",
    "such a spectrum would disfavor ssc from the forward shock , which typically peaks at tev energies near the deceleration time @xcite .",
    "the rate of the rise in flux up to the wide peak is hard to quantify , and therefore does not significantly constrain the theoretical models .",
    "the upper limits on the late time high - energy flux imply a flux decay at least as steep as @xmath127 .",
    "this is consistent with the steep decay that is expected from the reverse shock emission after the passage of the reverse shock , but only barely consistent with forward shock ssc emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for fast cooling for a sufficiently soft electron energy distribution , corresponding to a power - law index of @xmath128 .",
    "other emission mechanisms might also be able to produce a sufficiently steep flux decay rate .",
    "the possible high - energy cutoff around @xmath129mev in time bin ( a ) , i.e. the first @xmath130s from the trigger time , if true , is very interesting , as it does not appear to have a good simple explanation .",
    "the lack of a redshift measurement for grb  080825c , however , makes it difficult to draw very strong conclusions , even in this case . in time",
    "bin ( a ) , @xmath131kev is a factor of @xmath3@xmath132 lower than @xmath133 , thus disfavoring a quasi - thermal spectrum . a possible origin of such a cutoff from intrinsic opacity to pair production in the source ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be hard to reconcile with the non - thermal spectrum and sharp peak in the gbm light curve in time bin ( a ) , which both imply that the thomson optical depth @xmath134 of the pairs produced in the source can not be @xmath135 , for any reasonable redshift ( that is not @xmath136 ) .",
    "such a reasonable redshift would , in turn , typically imply a bulk lorentz factor of the emitting region of @xmath137 , and make it very difficult to produce @xmath129mev , corresponding to a comoving energy of @xmath138 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "producing the observed cutoff through intrinsic opacity to pair production requires @xmath139 . since the opacity to pair - production for a photon of energy @xmath140",
    "is produced mainly by photons of energy @xmath141",
    "( i.e. near threshold ) , and the cross - section to pair production near threshold is of the order of the thomson cross - section ( @xmath142 ) , then @xmath143 $ ] where @xmath144 is the thomson optical depth of the pairs that are produced if all the photons of energy near or above @xmath145 pair produce .",
    "in particular , taking @xmath146 implies that @xmath147 ( i.e. the thomson optical depth of the pairs produced by all the photons of energy @xmath148 is of order unity ) . in our scenario",
    "@xmath139 implies that all photons above @xmath140 pair produce , and since they are much more numerous than the photons above @xmath149 this produces a very large thomson optical depth in pairs , @xmath150 ( where @xmath151 is the high - energy photon index ) .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed spectrum and light curve , as mentioned above , since such a large optical depth would thermalize the spectrum and suppress the temporal variability .",
    "alternatively , a high - energy cutoff may reflect the energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons , but it is not clear why a power - law would extend over a very narrow range in this case and a much larger dynamical range in most other cases .",
    "grb  080514b was detected by agile , triggering on board both the superagile x - ray detector ( sa ) and the agile / mcal detector , and was observed by the grid instrument up to 300 mev @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray data above 30 mev show a significant extended duration with respect to emission in the hard x - ray and soft gamma - ray energy bands .",
    "a detailed analysis of this component was not possible due to limited statistics .",
    "another interesting fact is that in the case of grb  080514b , some grid events are detected when the low - energy emission has faded beyond detectability both in mcal and sa instruments .",
    "similarly , in the case of grb  080825c , emission in the nai detectors has receded to background level when the last lat events are detected . in both cases ,",
    "the behavior of the high - energy emission in the last part of the prompt emission does not seem to be correlated with that of the low - energy emission .",
    "this suggests that it may originate from a physically distinct emission region .",
    "the similar behavior observed in the high - energy emission of grbs 080514b and 080825c may suggest a common explanation .",
    "the longer duration of the high - energy ( @xmath119mev ) emission relative to the low - energy ( @xmath152mev ) emission , and to some extent ( though with much smaller statistical significance ) its later onset , are present not only in grb  080825c , but also in the two subsequent lat grbs , grb  080916c @xcite and grb  081024b @xcite .",
    "therefore , they appear to be common features of at least the first three lat grbs . additionally , the onset of the lat high - energy emission coincides with the second peak in the gbm low - energy light curve in all these three lat grbs .",
    "this has led  @xcite to favor an interpretation in which the first and second spikes of the low - energy light curve originate from two distinct emission regions with different intrinsic emission spectra , where the second spike has a harder high - energy photon index @xmath102 .",
    "this therefore accounts for the lat detection of the second spike and non - detection of the first spike .",
    "this interpretation is further supported in the case of grb  080916c by the clear change in both the low - energy ( @xmath101 ) and high - energy ( @xmath102 ) photon indices between the first and second peaks of the gbm ( low - energy ) light curve .",
    "this is not clearly seen in grb  080825c , possibly since it was not nearly as bright as grb  080916c .",
    "other explanations for the delayed onset are possible , and several other models were also considered by @xcite for grb  080916c .",
    "it was hard to clearly distinguish between the different models on the basis of the available data , despite the extreme brightness of grb  080916c ( which had an extremely large fluence of @xmath153 and a record breaking @xmath154 of @xmath155erg ) .",
    "for grb  080825c it is even harder to distinguish between the different possible explanations .",
    "temporally extended high - energy ( @xmath119mev ) emission , which lasted longer than the prompt low - energy ( sub - mev ) emission , was detected not only in grb  080825c , but also in the other two lat grbs mentioned above ( 080916c and 081024b ) , as well as in the agile grb  080514b and the egret grb  940217  @xcite .",
    "however , grb  080825c is the only one so far that shows a hint of a minimum in the high - energy flux between the early and late high - energy emission , which strengthens the case for an origin from a distinct physical region , as discussed above . in grb  080825c the late time high - energy emission has a harder photon index than the earlier high - energy emission , which is consistent with an external shock origin .",
    "the opposite is true for grb 080916c , which favors a somewhat different model such as external compton scattering of late time x - ray flare photons by forward shock electrons . in grb  080825c the highest - energy photon was detected after @xmath156s when the low - energy emission was already down to a very low level , while in grb  080916c the highest energy photon was detected after @xmath157s , while the low - energy emission was still very active .",
    "moreover , the observed duration of the high - energy emission in grb  080825c lasted only slightly longer than the low energy emission ( up to @xmath3@xmath122s compared to @xmath123s ) while in grb  080916c it lasted much longer ( more than @xmath3@xmath158s , compared to @xmath159s ) . while the high - energy emission in grb  080916c was detected for a longer time ,",
    "partly because it was generally much brighter than grb  080825c , it is also possibly because the flux decayed more slowly at late times ( as @xmath160 , compared to steeper than @xmath127 in grb  080825c ) .",
    "grb  080825c is the first grb detected by the lat , with 13 events above 80  mev and a detection significance of @xmath3@xmath161 .",
    "the highest energy events , up to @xmath3@xmath162mev , are detected at late times , @xmath3@xmath163s after the gbm trigger , when the emission in gbm has decreased close to the background level .",
    "the lack of @xmath164  gev events in the lat and the large angle of the source to the lat boresight result in a localization uncertainty of @xmath165 ( statistical plus systematic ) at the @xmath166 level .    the prompt emission spectrum from both instruments onboard fermi covers over 5 decades in energy .",
    "we have performed time - resolved spectral analysis using the two gbm nai detectors with the brightest grb signal , both gbm bgo detectors , and for the lat with an event selection scheme that is optimized for grb analysis .",
    "we have carefully taken the energy - dependent backgrounds into account for both gbm and lat , and studied the systematic uncertainties in the spectral analysis .",
    "the time - integrated and time - resolved spectra are well fit by the band function with a hard - to - soft evolution in the first @xmath167s : @xmath98 evolves from @xmath3@xmath168 to @xmath3@xmath100kev , the high - energy power - law index @xmath102 is constant at a value of @xmath3@xmath169 , while the low - energy power - law index @xmath101 is fairly constant except for the second time bin which contains the first lat events . in the last time",
    "bin , @xmath3@xmath163s after the gbm trigger time , the gbm data are barely above background level , and the spectrum is best fit by a single power law with an index of @xmath3@xmath170 which is significantly harder than the @xmath102 values of the earlier intervals .",
    "the duration and start time of the late broad peak in the high - energy emission , @xmath3@xmath171s after the trigger , suggest that this peak is emitted by the external reverse or forward shocks , rather than by internal dissipation within the grb outflow ( e.g. , internal shocks or magnetic reconnection ) .",
    "the relatively fast flux decay after this peak slightly favors a reverse - forward shock ` external ' compton origin over a forward shock ssc origin . although the origin and emission mechanism for this late peak can not be conclusively determined because of low number statistics ( and the lack of observations at x - ray or optical wavelengths , due to the poor grb localization ) , the external shock origin is further supported by the change in spectral behavior , in particular of the spectral index , at these late times .",
    "observations of more , brighter grbs with both gbm and lat will be able to test this hypothesis .",
