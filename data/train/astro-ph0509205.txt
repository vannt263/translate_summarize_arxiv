    "the density of background x - ray sources at least this bright ( @xmath93 , assuming @xmath94 and galactic @xmath85 ) is about 100 per square degree @xcite , so the likelihood of finding one within 10  of at least one of our 30 survey targets observed to date is @xmath957% .",
    "the low galactic latitude of 1421 - 490 ( @xmath96 ) increases the likelihood that this is an unrelated source .",
    "a weak optical source lies @xmath97 ne of b ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 with no extinction correction ) .",
    "it lacks any radio or x - ray counterpart and is consistent with a point source , hence is likely to be a foreground star in this crowded field .",
    "we do not discuss either object further .",
    "we suggest that region c is a terminal hot spot due to its extended radio structure and steep spectrum .",
    "the knotty question is whether we have a core at a with a one - sided jet extending through b to c or a symmetric system with a core at b between hot spots at a and c. the radio spectral indices do not provide guidance because both a and b have flat spectra typical of self - absorbed quasar cores .",
    "the detection of a compact , high brightness temperature vlbi source with apparent core - jet morphology coincident with a1 is suggestive but not conclusive : a hot spot could contain a compact component , although it would be exceptional for it to have core - jet structure and to provide so much ( 35% ) of the @xmath08.5  ghz flux density .",
    "the lack of a vlbi source at b is likewise not significant because b would not have been detected by extant observations .",
    "for now we adopt the one - sided jet scenario , guided by the vlbi source at a1 .",
    "this choice may need to be reconsidered as new data become available .",
    "however , we note that @xmath101 , consistent with a core / inner jet interpretation .",
    "one other possibility warrants consideration : that a and b are cores in separate systems . in comparison with other jet knot - core pairs ,",
    "the b / a x - ray flux ratio is atypical and the optical ratio unprecedented . given that x - ray sources with @xmath102 have a density of @xmath01.0 per square degree @xcite , the chance of finding such a source @xmath10310  from any of the systems so far observed in our jet survey is @xmath0@xmath104 if we neglect the possibility of clustering .",
    "thus it is unlikely that a and b are unrelated .",
    "we obtained an optical spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ optspec ] ) to test whether b is an interloper",
    ". only one tentative feature , an absorption line at 5825 , exceeds @xmath105 the local rms .",
    "a redshift limit of @xmath106 is required by the absence of a lyman forest at @xmath107 .",
    "the lack of strong spectral features rules out identification with common objects such as normal stars , galaxies and most types of agn , and is consistent with non - thermal emission from a jet knot .",
    "the only remaining candidates are dc white dwarfs ( wds ) and bl  lac objects .",
    "the former can be dismissed immediately as these cool wds are neither radio nor x - ray sources and are generally bluer ( @xmath108 , ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , whereas b has @xmath109 ) .",
    "moreover , photographic plates from the yale / san juan southern proper motion survey ( spm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) limit the proper motion of b to @xmath1038 mas yr@xmath110 ( d.  i.  dinescu 2004 , private communication ) ; with a distance @xmath103150  pc ( based upon the brightest known dc wds ; @xcite ) the tangential motion is limited to @xmath111 whereas wds typically have @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "if b is a bl  lac , then it is highly unusual .",
    "its @xmath113 index is typical of x - ray - selected bl  lacs , but @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively values at 2500    and 2  kev to facilitate comparison with @xcite . ] ) are exceptional , making b an outlier when compared to published samples @xcite .",
    "however , other methods of selection may broaden the distribution of indices e.g. , the optically - selected , radio - quiet bl  lac candidate discovered by @xcite .",
    "bl  lac objects typically vary in the optical by a magnitude or more on time scales of years , but catalogs and archival data show @xmath118 over 35  yr and @xmath119 on time scales up to 27  yr .",
    "finally , bl  lacs with comparable x - ray fluxes are rare : the chance of having one within 10  of _ any _ of our 30 _ chandra _ targets is @xmath120 @xcite ; finding one aligned with a radio jet is even less likely .",
    "thus , while we can not completely rule out a bl  lac interloper , we favor an association of b with pks  b1421 - 490 .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of feature b are unlike those of any other known jet knot .",
    "its optical apparent magnitude is second only to knot hst-1 of m87 despite lying at a much greater distance .",
    "hst-1 has a comparable x - ray @xmath121/@xmath122 ratio , but its optical ratio is 3 , compared to @xmath0300 for knot  b @xcite .",
    "the core sed can be modeled as emission from the parsec - scale base of the jet .",
    "the spectral index of a1 between 17.7 and 20.2  ghz is 0.5 , roughly consistent with strong - shock acceleration models .",
    "a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model with an equipartition magnetic field ( @xmath123 ) is plausible for the core as long as there is relativistic boosting towards the observer .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ sedfig ] shows a model of a jet with bulk motion of @xmath124 at 2.9to the line of sight , radius 0.5  mas ( 4  pc ) , electron number spectrum index @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and an energy - loss break by 1.0 at @xmath128 .",
    "such a model gives a reasonable description of the sed with @xmath129  mg . without relativistic beaming ssc models with @xmath130",
    "predict an x - ray flux @xmath0@xmath131 higher . for region",
    "b we also use synchrotron emission to model the radio - to - optical flux .",
    "the flat spectrum and apparent turn - over at low radio frequencies might suggest self - absorption in a series of small - scale components .",
    "this is often the case in cores but not large - scale jets . while there could be a self - absorbed region within the kpc - scale knot if the magnetic field is sufficiently high ( @xmath0 mg ) , we prefer instead an optically thin model . without beaming , a model consisting of a sphere of radius 005 ( 0.4  kpc ) , with @xmath132  mg , @xmath133 , @xmath126 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , yields a reasonable fit ( fig .",
    "[ sedfig ] ) , although it violates the @xmath136 limit and it is difficult to reproduce @xmath137 unless @xmath138 above @xmath139 .",
    "an unusually high @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) would provide a better compromise between the flat 8.620  ghz radio spectrum and the low 4.8  ghz flux density , although the physical mechanism would be uncertain ; @xmath123 would be little changed .",
    "the flatness of the optical spectrum suggests that the electron distribution would be better modelled as multiple components with a distribution of @xmath142 values .",
    "the radiative lifetime of the optically - emitting electrons is only of order 40  years , implying distributed electron acceleration across the knot .",
    "smaller electron lorentz factors apply if the source size is reduced .",
    "the greater difficulty is to explain the x - ray emission .",
    "unlike the core , the relatively larger angular size and lower radio luminosity of the knot means that ssc is not effective unless most of the radio emission is from embedded regions smaller than we adopt for the core .",
    "the observed flux is too low to be a simple continuation of the optical synchrotron and too flat to be the plunging high - energy tail of this component .",
    "synchrotron x - ray emission requires a second population of electrons extending to @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "the resulting emission extrapolates well below the fluxes measured at lower frequencies , thus @xmath140 is unconstrained . _ in situ _ acceleration is required to sustain this population as the cooling time is much shorter than the light - crossing time of the region .",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) models likewise have problems reproducing the knot x - ray emission .",
    "ic scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( ic - cmb ; @xcite ; @xcite ) for @xmath145 requires a bulk lorentz factor @xmath146 to boost the x - ray output by 8 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is inconsistent with our expectation that the knot should be less boosted than the core , especially after a bend in the jet as between a2 and b. a higher assumed redshift would ease this constraint , since @xmath147 @xcite , but even at @xmath148 we require @xmath149 .",
    "this limit could be reduced to @xmath150 if magnetic fields significantly below @xmath123 are considered .",
    "a decelerating jet model @xcite with a lower @xmath151 and @xmath152 can provide a qualitatively correct sed .",
    "a @xmath124 , @xmath153  mg flow oriented 2.9  from our line of sight that decelerates to semi - relativistic velocities within the @xmath154  kpc volume of knot b reproduces the optical flux with a strongly doppler - boosted synchrotron peak and provides x - rays through ic scattering of photons from the slowed , downstream portion of the jet .",
    "both ic models require abundant @xmath155 electrons to produce x - rays .",
    "these electrons can be in a second population ( this time at low energies ) , or part of the synchrotron - emitting population if @xmath140 is much lower than the assumed value of @xmath156 .",
    "a low @xmath140 would require the knot to contain unusually compact , self - absorbed sub - regions to avoid producing an order of magnitude more radio flux than observed .",
    "we have chosen to interpret pks  b1421 - 490 as a flat spectrum radio source with a one - sided jet and a unique knot at b. the optically - dominated spectral energy distribution of feature  b can be explained by two models .",
    "both invoke a synchrotron component for the radio - to - optical continuum , but one attributes the x - ray flux to synchrotron emission from a second electron population while the other involves inverse compton scattering by a relativistic , decelerating jet .",
    "alternative interpretations that currently can not be ruled out include a symmetric system with a core at  b and knots at  a and  c , and either an interaction , or a chance alignment , of pks  b1421 - 490 and an unrelated ( and unusual ) optically - dominated , radio - quiet bl  lac .",
    "deeper optical spectroscopy is urgently needed to measure the redshift of a and provide a high s / n spectrum to better identify b. observations in the mm , sub - mm , ir and far - uv bands would fill in the sed , thereby providing strong constraints for models of the emission processes .",
    "feature b is a good target for optical polarimetry , which could help confirm whether it is dominated by synchrotron jet emission .",
    "finally , we look forward to an upcoming long _ chandra _ observation that will allow a more detailed x - ray study and a deep vlbi mapping that will test the core - jet structure at a1 and possibly identify compact emission regions within b.      the authors thank bill van altena , dana dinescu and terry girard for their assistance with the spm archive . this work has been supported in part under sao contracts go4 - 5124 , sv1 - 61010 , and nas8 - 39073 , and nasa ltsa grant nag5 - 9997 .",
