    "pair creation by a photon in an electromagnetic field is the basic qed reaction which can play the significant role in many processes .",
    "this process was considered first in a magnetic field .",
    "investigation of pair creation by a photon in a strong magnetic field was started in 1952 independently by klepikov and toll @xcite . in klepikov",
    "s paper @xcite , which was based on the solution of the dirac equation in a constant and homogeneous magnetic field , the probabilities of radiation from an electron and @xmath2 pair creation by a photon were obtained for the magnetic field of arbitrary strength on the mass shell and the metric @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the 4-momentum of photon ) . in 1971 adler @xcite calculated the photon polarization operator in the mentioned magnetic field using the proper - time technique developed by schwinger @xcite and batalin and shabad @xcite calculated the photon polarization operator in a constant and homogeneous electromagnetic field for @xmath5 using the green function in this field found by schwinger @xcite . in 1975",
    "strakhovenko and present authors calculated the contribution of a charged - particles loop with @xmath6 external photon lines having applied the proper - time method in a constant and homogeneous electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "for @xmath7 the explicit expressions for the contribution of scalar and spinor particles to the polarization operator of photon are given .",
    "using this polarization operator the integral probability of pair creation by a photon in a magnetic field was analyzed by authors in @xcite .",
    "the probability of pair creation by a photon in a constant and homogeneous electric field in the quasiclassical approximation was found by narozhny @xcite using the solution of dirac equation in the sauter potential @xcite .",
    "nikishov @xcite obtained the differential cross section of this process using the solution of dirac equation in a constant and homogeneous electric field .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the integral probability of pair creation in an electric field basing on the polarization operator @xcite . in sec.2",
    "the exact expression for the integral probability of pair creation by a photon was obtained for the general case @xmath5 starting from the polarization operator in an electric field . in sec.3 the standard quasiclassical approximation ( sqa )",
    "is outlined for the high - energy photons @xmath8 is the electron mass ) , the corrections to sqa are calculated .",
    "these corrections define also the region applicability of sqa . in sec.4",
    "the new approach is developed for relatively low energies where sqa is not applicable .",
    "this approach is based of the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "the obtained probability is valid in the wide interval of photon energies and is overlapped with sqa . in sec.5 the case of the very low photon energies @xmath9 is analyzed .",
    "in particular , in the energy region @xmath10 where the previous approach is unapplicable , the low energy approximation is developed . in turn the found results have an overlapping region of applicability with the previous approach .",
    "so we have three overlapping approximations which include all photon energies .",
    "in conclusion we touch upon the problem connected with the vacuum instability .",
    "our analysis is based on the expression for the polarization operator obtained in @xcite , see eqs.(3.19 ) , ( 3.33 ) . for pure electric field ( * h*=0 ) this polarization operation can be written in the diagonal form @xmath11 here @xmath12 where the axis 3 directed along the electric field * e * , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the photon energy , @xmath16 is the tensor of electromagnetic field , @xmath17 is the dual tensor of electromagnetic field , and @xmath18 here @xmath19    let us note that the integration contour in eq.([d2 ] ) is turned slightly down , and in the function @xmath20 in the integral over @xmath21 the subtraction at @xmath22 is implied .",
    "it should be noted that the probability of pair creation in an electric field ( see eqs.([d0])-([d3 ] ) ) can be obtained from the probability of pair creation in a magnetic field ( eqs.(2.1)-(2.5 ) in @xcite ) using the formal substitutions @xmath23 .",
    "the imaginary part of the polarization operator determines the total probability of @xmath2 pair creation per unit length @xmath24 by a photon with a given polarization @xmath25 using the photon polarization vector @xmath26 we get the expressions for @xmath27 at @xmath5 : @xmath28 on the mass shell ( @xmath29 ) one has to put @xmath30 in eq.([d2 ] ) . in this case @xmath31 and only two photon polarizations @xmath32 and @xmath33 contribute . in this case",
    "the total probability of pair creation averaged over the photon polarizations is @xmath34    the corresponding analysis in a magnetic field ( * e*=0 ) was performed in @xcite .",
    "there are essential differences between pair creation process in magnetic and electric field .    1 .",
    "the probabilities of pair creation @xmath35 ( for each photon polarization ) in a magnetic field contain the factor @xmath36 and @xmath37 at each threshold when electrons and positrons are created on the landau levels . because of this the functions @xmath35 have saw - tooth form .",
    "rather laborious transformations of the imaginary part of the polarization operator are performed in @xcite to obtain the form allowing the direct calculation of the pair creation probabilities .",
    "it s more than difficult to use for this purpose directly the expression @xmath38 . in an electric field",
    "there are no levels and @xmath39 is a smooth function of @xmath40 and can be calculated directly using the above equation taking into account that the integration contour in eq.([d2 ] ) is turned slightly down .",

    "the pair creation is the result of conversion of a photon into pair .",
    "the constant and homogeneous magnetic field itself does nt create a pair .",
    "the vacuum is stable .",
    "for this reason eq.([d4 ] ) gives not only imaginary part of the photon energy but else the overall probability of pair creation .",
    "the expression for the polarization operator is valid for field strength @xmath44 ( one of possible application of the theory are processes in magnetars with @xmath45 ) . in an electric field , generally speaking , pairs can be created by field itself , without a photon presence .",
    "the vacuum is unstable .",
    "then eq.([d4 ] ) gives the partial probability of pair creation . in the limit",
    "@xmath46 the instability of vacuum is negligible .",
    "but at @xmath47 the vacuum pair creation becomes essential .",

    "this is because in the quasiclassical approximation the expression for the probability depends on an electromagnetic field via parameter @xmath64 ( in the frame where electric and magnetic fields are parallel ) .",
    "below we will see that at lower energy the probabilities of pair photoproduction are very different in electric and in magnetic fields .",
    "the probability of pair creation by a photon averaged over photon polarization eq.([d5a ] ) calculated in this approximation eq.([c6 ] ) coincide with curves found in calculation of exact expressions eqs.([d5])-([d5a ] ) given in fig.1 . near maximum of the curves",
