    "much of this emission arises from the warm and dense photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) that form on the uv - illuminated surfaces of molecular clouds .",
    "the [ cii ] transition is a primary pdr coolant , and is a sensitive probe of both the physical conditions of the photodissociated gas , and the intensity of the ambient stellar radiation field  @xcite . in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ,",

    "we have initiated a search for [ cii ] emission from galaxies at @xmath21 , concentrating on star - formation  dominated systems selected by their fir or submillimeter continuum brightness . here",
    "we report our first detection , from the @xmath4 hyperluminous starburst galaxy mips j142824.0 + 352619 ( hereafter mips j1428 ) .",
    "mips j1428 was identified in a spitzer / mips blank field survey as a bright 160 @xmath1 m source with red optical / near - ir colors , and subsequent spectroscopic and photometric measurements established it as a hyperluminous ( @xmath22 @xmath1m@xmath23=3.2\\times10^{13}$ ] @xmath3 ) galaxy at @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "there are several indications that this ir emission is powered by star formation , including the brightness of the pah features and the nondetection in hard x - ray emission , and with a starburst origin the estimated @xmath25 corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath8@xmath26 @xmath27 yr@xmath28  @xcite .",
    "mips j1428 was detected in co(@xmath29@xmath13@xmath30 ) and co(@xmath31@xmath13@xmath29 ) , and the line luminosities correspond to a large gas mass of @xmath32 @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "however , a gravitational lens may amplify the flux by as much as a factor of 10  @xcite , making the actual star formation rate and gas mass correspondingly lower .",
    "independent of the unknown lensing amplification , the large value of @xmath34 @xmath3 ( k km s@xmath28)@xmath28  @xcite indicates that mips j1428 is forming stars with high efficiency , similar to that seen in local ulirgs and high - redshift submillimeter galaxies ( smgs )  @xcite .",
    "this is the first detection of [ cii ] in the @xmath35 epoch of peak star formation activity in the universe , and the first detection from a high - redshift galaxy not associated with a qso .",
    "we observed the [ cii ] line toward mips j1428 in march 2008 with zeus  @xcite at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "zeus is a dual - band ( 350 and 450 @xmath1 m ) grating spectrometer equipped with a @xmath36 semiconductor bolometer array . for this observing run the instrument",
    "was configured as described in  @xcite . at the redshifted wavelength ( @xmath37 @xmath1 m ) of the [ cii ] transition",
    "the spectrometer provides a slit - limited resolving power of @xmath38 , and the 14 detectors operating in the 350 @xmath1 m window combine to provide an instantaneous bandwidth corresponding to @xmath39 km s@xmath28 .",
    "orion ( bn - kl ) was used as spectral calibrator , and mars  ( @xmath40 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as flux calibrator .",
    "we integrated on mips j1428 for a total of @xmath41 minutes ( including chopping ) in good submillimeter weather , with @xmath42@xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath44 zeus / cso beam was centered at @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( j2000.0 ) , and the data were obtained by chopping and nodding the telescope with a 30@xmath47 throw . a linear baseline is removed from the final spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . the integrated line flux is @xmath48 jy km s@xmath28 , and we compare this with other observations in table  [ mips_tracers ] . with @xmath49 @xmath3  @xcite , we estimate @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}\\approx2.1\\times10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "carbon has a lower ionization potential ( 11.26 ev ) than hydrogen , and consequently the [ cii ] transition is an important coolant of both ionized gas and diffuse atomic gas .",
    "however , most of the [ cii ] emission from nearby ir - bright galaxies arises from dense pdrs illuminated by the far - uv ( fuv ) radiation from young stars  @xcite . combined hii region and pdr modeling of the starburst",
    "templates ngc 253  @xcite and m82  @xcite has demonstrated that pdrs account for at least 70% of the [ cii ] emission in these sources .",
    "the available data suggests that such starburst galaxies are the best local analogs of mips j1428 ( see section  [ discussion ] ) , so here we assume that 70% of the [ cii ] emission from mips j1428 arises in pdrs .",
    "we further assume that pdrs produce all of the co(@xmath29@xmath13@xmath30 ) , co(@xmath31@xmath13@xmath29 ) , and fir continuum emission in this source , and we model these tracers as arising from a single representative pdr .",

    "these models calculate the line emission generated by a cloud illuminated on only one side , and must be modified to model clouds in the active regions of galaxies that are illuminated on all sides . for this geometry ,  @xcite note that an observer will detect optically thin radiation emitted by both the near and far sides of the cloud , while optically thick emission will only be visible from the near side .",
    "the [ cii ] line is generally moderately optically thin in these calculations , and the fir continuum is also assumed to be optically thin , but the low-@xmath70 co transitions are optically thick for the nominal @xmath71 cloud depth .",
    "we therefore increase the measured co fluxes by a factor of 2 with respect to these other tracers before comparing with the models . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the values of @xmath65 and @xmath67 allowed by the observations listed in table  [ mips_tracers ] , after correcting the [ cii ] and co measurements as described above . in the @xmath72 @xmath7 range",
    "the @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratio provides a strong constraint on @xmath67 , while the @xmath5}/l_{\\mathrm{co}(2\\rightarrow1)}$ ] ratio is primarily a function of density .",
    "the best fit solution obtained from these two ratios is consistent with the @xmath73 @xmath7 lower limit imposed by the @xmath74 ratio , and we conclude that the relative strengths of the [ cii ] , co(@xmath29@xmath13@xmath30 ) , co(@xmath31@xmath13@xmath29 ) , and fir continuum emission may be reproduced by a pdr with @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath75 .",
    "reducing the pdr contribution to the total [ cii ] emission by a factor of 2 ( 3 ) would increase @xmath65 by a factor of 7.2 ( 22 ) , but @xmath67 by only a factor of 1.6 ( 1.8 ) .",
    "we also note that without the factor of 2 correction to the observed co fluxes , @xmath65 would be 4.2 times lower , but @xmath67 would remain unchanged .",
    "an estimate of the atomic gas mass associated with the pdrs in mips j1428 is obtained from the inferred [ cii ] luminosity and this pdr solution . assuming the [ cii ] emission is optically thin , this mass is given as @xmath76}}{l_{\\sun } } \\biggr ) \\biggl ( \\frac{1.4 \\times 10^{-4}}{x_\\mathrm{c^+ } } \\biggr ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\biggl ( \\frac{1 + 2\\ , \\mathrm{exp}(-91\\,\\mathrm{k}/t ) + n_\\mathrm{crit}/n}{2\\ , \\mathrm{exp}(-91\\,\\mathrm{k}/t ) } \\biggr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use a c@xmath15 abundance per hydrogen atom of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "the surface temperature of a pdr with @xmath78 @xmath7 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 k  @xcite .",
    "assuming this temperature is representative of the full c@xmath15 region , and adopting a critical density of @xmath81 @xmath7  @xcite , this expression yields @xmath82@xmath83 @xmath33 ( where @xmath1 is the lensing amplification ) .",
    "this is 55% of the molecular gas mass estimated from the co luminosity  @xcite , which is similar to the pdr mass fractions in starburst galaxies  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corrected for the smaller @xmath84 used here ) .",
    "much like in nearby starburst nuclei , the pdr mass in mips j1428 is a significant fraction of the total molecular gas mass .",
    "to place our [ cii ] measurement of mips j1428 in context , we compare the [ cii ] , co , and fir continuum emission from this source with that from other galaxies and galactic sources . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot the @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] and @xmath85 ratios for samples of galactic star - forming regions and nearby gas - rich galaxies  @xcite , normal galaxies  @xcite , local ulirgs  @xcite , and mips j1428 and the 3 other high - redshift sources detected in [ cii ]  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the co(@xmath30@xmath13@xmath86 ) luminosity of mips j1428 assuming an @xmath87 ratio intermediate between the ratios observed in local ulirgs  ( @xmath88@xmath89 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in starburst nuclei  ( @xmath88@xmath90 ; * ? ? ?",

    "for reference , we overplot the pdr model curves from  @xcite .",
    "a vector attached to the mips j1428 data point indicates how the measured ratios were adjusted for the pdr analysis in section  [ pdranalysis ] ( to account for non - pdr contributions to the [ cii ] emission , and optical depth effects in the co transititions ) , and we further note that mips j1428 is placed in figure  [ fig3 ] assuming an @xmath91 ratio @xmath88@xmath92 lower than our best fit pdr solution .",
    "we compare mips j1428 with each of the populations shown in figure  [ fig3 ] in turn .",
    "@xcite study the [ cii ] emission from the central regions of a sample of nearby galaxies , and find that the @xmath5}/l_{\\mathrm{co}(1\\rightarrow0)}$ ] and @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratios are sensitive tracers of the star formation activity in these sources .",
    "starburst galaxies are well characterized by the same @xmath5}/l_{\\mathrm{co}(1\\rightarrow0)}=4100 $ ] ratio seen in galactic star - forming regions , which is a factor of @xmath8@xmath31 times larger than in non - starburst galaxies and galactic molecular clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratios in starburst galaxies are higher than those observed in the most intense galactic ob star formation regions .",
    "these results imply that while much of the molecular gas in a starburst nucleus is photodissociated by the fuv radiation from young stars , the very intense fields found in the most extreme galactic star - forming regions are not providing the bulk of the luminosity .",
    "this picture is supported by pdr modeling , which indicates that the fuv fields producing the emission in the centers of starburst galaxies are intermediate in intensity between those producing the emission in non - starburst galaxies , and those found in galactic ob star formation regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as the data point for mips j1428 falls near the high-@xmath67 end of the distribution of starburst points in figure  [ fig3 ] , we conclude that in mips j1428 , like in nearby starburst nuclei , the bulk of the molecular gas is exposed to moderately - intense fuv radiation produced by young stars . @xcite",

    "iso_-lws beam .",
    "these authors find that the fir continuum and much of the [ cii ] emission arises from pdrs , which in many of their galaxies are characterized by similarly elevated values of @xmath67 as deduced here for mips j1428 .",
    "however , the  @xcite sources have lower @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{co}$ ] ratios than mips j1428 or its starburst analogs , indicating that most of the co emission is produced by molecular gas residing in less active star - forming regions than those that produce the fine - structure line emission .",
    "this difference helps reinforce our conclusion that in mips j1428 it is the entire galaxy , rather than just an active central region , that is host to vigorous star formation .",
    "the median @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratio in local ulirgs is a factor of @xmath8@xmath18 times lower than in normal star - forming galaxies  @xcite , and a factor of @xmath8@xmath94 times lower than in mips j1428 .",
    "one possible explanation for this low ratio is that the [ cii ] emission is produced in dense pdrs illuminated by intense fuv radiation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as indicated by the pdr model overlays in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "alternatively , the [ cii ] emission may originate in pdrs with more modest values of @xmath65 and @xmath67 , but an additional source of fir continuum emission may lower the global @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratio  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the origins of the weak [ cii ] emission in local ulirgs , it is clear that these galaxies provide poor templates for mips j1428 .",
    "we also include the 3 high - redshift qsos detected in [ cii ] in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "sdss j1148 has been detected in co(@xmath31@xmath13@xmath29 ) and bri 0952 in co(@xmath95@xmath13@xmath94 ) , and we use the measured @xmath96 and modeled @xmath97 ratios for mrk 231  @xcite to estimate the co(@xmath30@xmath13@xmath86 ) luminosities for these sources . to account for the uncertainties in the co excitation of high - redshift systems  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we show these data points with errors bars corresponding to 0.2 dex and 0.3 dex , respectively . the low @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] and @xmath10 ratios in sdss j1148 and br 1202n indicate similar physical conditions as in local ulirgs . indeed ,  @xcite found that the [ cii ] , co , and fir continuum emission of sdss j1148 is consistent with a high - density , high-@xmath67 pdr , and  @xcite showed that the star formation in this system is confined to a compact region with a high surface brightness comparable to that at the center of arp 220 .",
    "however , bri 0952 has a larger @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratio and a @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{co}$ ] ratio similar to that in mips j1428 .",
    "we suggest that while sdss j1148 and br 1202n are likely dissimilar to mips j1428 , the connection drawn here between mips j1428 and local starburst nuclei may also provide insight into the nature of the host galaxy of bri 0952 . finally , it is important to note that while we assume that the @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] and @xmath10 ratios in mips j1428 are unaffected by the potential gravitational lensing , we can not rule out the possibility that these ratios are altered by differential magnification .",
    "for example , one could construct a model in which the intrinsic emission ratios of mips j1428 are similar to those in local ulirgs , but where the @xmath5}/l_\\mathrm{fir}$ ] ratio is enhanced by the relatively large magnification of a localized hii region that falls near a caustic .",
    "however , in the absence of other evidence supporting such a scenario , we assume that the measured flux ratios are equal to the intrinsic luminosity ratios",
    ".      the molecular gas in mips j1428 is exposed to similar uv radiation fields , and has similar excitation , as the gas in the central region of a typical starburst galaxy , and we suggest that mips j1428 may be modeled as a scaled - up version of a starburst nucleus . as an example , we consider scaling up the central region of the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 in such a manner as to match the much larger luminosity of mips j1428 , while at the same time conserving the strength of the characteristic fuv radiation field that controls the pdr emission .",
    "we assume that in a starburst environment this characteristic field is determined by the global star formation density , rather than by the purely local properties of the interactions between individual star clusters and their natal molecular clouds .",
    "this interpretation was adopted for m82 and ngc 253 based on multiple - line pdr analysis  @xcite , and is also motivated by the non - linear relation between @xmath98}$ ] and @xmath99 observed in larger samples of galactic nuclei  @xcite .    for a starburst region in which young stellar clusters and molecular clouds are randomly distributed ,",
    "@xcite modeled the relationship between the average fuv flux incident on the molecular gas ( @xmath67 ) , and the size ( @xmath100 ) and total luminosity ( @xmath25 ) of the region .",
    "this relationship depends on the mean free path of a fuv photon ( @xmath101 ) , but in the limits of @xmath102 and @xmath103 these models give @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . adopting @xmath106 @xmath3 for the central @xmath107 pc starburst region of m82  @xcite , and assuming that mips j1428 and m82 have the same average @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the factor of @xmath8@xmath108@xmath83 greater luminosity of mips j1428 then translates into a size scale of @xmath109@xmath110@xmath111 kpc . in short ,",
    "if the large luminosity of mips j1428 is produced by only moderate - intensity radiation , the star formation generating this radiation must be extended over a large area .",
    "while mips j1428 remains unresolved in dust continuum and molecular gas emission , integral field spectroscopy shows h@xmath112 emission extended over @xmath88@xmath113 ( @xmath88@xmath114 kpc )  @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with our interpretation of mips j1428 as a source powered by extended star formation , although the degree to which the h@xmath112 image is distorted by the foreground lens , or by the presence of large and spatially - varying extinction , is unknown .",
    "further interpretation of the connection between the bright [ cii ] emission in mips j1428 and the potentially large extent of the star formation will benefit from a size measurement in an extinction - free tracer , and better constraints on the lensing magnification .",
    "if mips j1428 is indeed powered by a starburst extending over several kiloparsecs this would be in sharp contrast to local ulirgs , in which most of the emission traced by co interferometry is contained within the central @xmath8@xmath30 kpc  @xcite .",
    "however , there is ample evidence that the most luminous star - forming galaxies at higher redshifts are more extended .",
    "the best studied sample of such sources are the smgs , which like mips j1428 are submillimeter - bright galaxies with luminosities of @xmath2 @xmath3 that are generated predominantly by star formation  @xcite .",
    "interferometric imaging of the radio continuum of @xmath35 smgs has shown that many of these sources have detectable emission extended over @xmath8@xmath115 kpc  @xcite , and that the population has a median fwhm size of @xmath8@xmath95 kpc  @xcite .",
    "similarly , many of the smgs studied by  @xcite have co fwhm sizes of @xmath8@xmath94 kpc . the model of extended star formation we suggest here for mips j1428 is therefore consistent with the large sizes of smgs , which indicate that the most luminous star - forming galaxies at @xmath35 are powered by starbursts extending over much larger regions than in local systems .",
