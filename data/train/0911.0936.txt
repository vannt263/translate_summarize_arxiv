    "the fate of planetary systems around sun - like stars can be studied by finding planets around their white dwarf ( wd ) remnants .",
    "wds are physically small ( @xmath1 ) , which sharply limits their luminosity in the infrared , where the planet spectrum peaks @xcite .",
    "compared to main - sequence ( ms ) stars , the significant gain in contrast makes wds excellent targets for photometric searches for planetary companions .",
    "however , to this day , no planet detection around wds has been reported . _",
    "spitzer _ irac imaging surveys by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and near - infrared imaging surveys by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were unsuccessful in finding planetary mass companions to wds with limits typically between 5 and @xmath2 .",
    "here we focus on using low - mass wds to provide additional leverage for detecting planetary mass companions .      timing measurements of pulsating wds is an alternative , powerful method to search for planets @xcite , but this method can be used only for a limited sample of stars",
    ". there is a promising signature of a @xmath3 planet in the pulsation timing measurements of the wd gd 66 @xcite .",
    "however , a full orbit has not been observed , and this detection remains provisional ( f. mullally 2009 , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "the discovery of circumstellar debris disks around more than a dozen wds imply that 1% to 3% of wds with cooling ages @xmath4 500 myr have disks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "these disks most likely formed by tidally disrupted asteroids @xcite .",
    "hence , there is indirect evidence that at least a few percent of wds have remnant planetary systems . of course",
    ", the observed debris disk fraction may represent only the planetary systems that become unstable during post - ms evolution , and the true fraction of wds with planets may be much higher .",
    "the reason for the lack of known planetary companions to wds may be a target selection effect @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that less than 3% of the stars with @xmath50.5 @xmath4 [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.0 have doppler - detected planets , whereas 25% of the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 + 0.3 have gas giant planets .",
    "based on the age - metallicity relation derived by @xcite , @xcite find that only 3% of the stars in the solar neighborhood have had [ fe / h ] @xmath6 + 0.3 in the past 10 gyr .",
    "therefore , a random selection of wds would be dominated by wds that come from low metallicity progenitors .",
    "the best way to find planetary companions to wds may be to search for companions to wds that form from metal - rich stars .",
    "low - mass helium - core wds ( @xmath7 ) can be produced from interacting binary systems , and traditionally all of them have been attributed to this channel .",
    "however , a low - mass wd can also result from a single star that experiences severe mass loss on the first ascent giant branch .",
    "@xcite identified several low - mass wds in the upper part of the wd cooling sequence of the metal - rich cluster ngc 6791 , and they argued that there is a mechanism in clusters to produce low - mass wds without requiring binary star interactions .",
    "however , this argument is now challenged by @xcite , who argue that the bright peak observed in the wd luminosity fuction of this cluster is better explained as binary wds .",
    "@xcite also argue that the low - mass wds found by @xcite can be explained as the product of binary star evolution .",
    "unlike the relatively faint low - mass wds in ngc 6791 , it is possible to obtain radial velocity measurements of low - mass wds in the field and test the binary formation scenario .",
    "around half the low - mass wds observed by @xcite lack detectable radial velocity companions . the eso snia progenitor survey ( spy ) searched for radial velocity variations in more than a thousand wds using the very large telescope @xcite .",
    "they found that about 58% of the low - mass wds in their sample do not show radial velocity variations @xcite .",
    "their detailed analysis of the detection probability of ms , wd , and brown dwarf companions show that their observations of low - mass wds are inconsistent with the idea that all of them reside in close binary systems .",
    "the spy observations are less sensitive to brown dwarf companions , because of their smaller mass , but even in this case 100% binary fraction rate can be ruled out ( r. napiwotzki 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite argue that these single low - mass wds might come from old metal - rich stars that truncate their evolution prior to the helium flash from severe mass loss .",
    "the fraction of single low - mass wds among the field wd sample is also compatible with the fraction of metal - rich dwarfs among the field dwarf population .",
    "a strong implication of the @xcite scenario is that single low - mass wds are good targets for planet searches because they may arise from metal - rich progenitors .",
    "this leads to an inversion of prior strategies for seeking planetary companions to wds , which avoid low - mass wds on the grounds that they are the products of binary interactions . instead",
    ", some of these objects may be the descendants of metal - rich stars that are known to have a high frequency of planet detection .",
    "if the progenitors of these single low - mass wds have planets , the planets are more likely to survive the post - ms evolution , as these he - core wds do not go through the asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "an alternative formation scenario for single low - mass wds is proposed by @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "low - mass wds form from sun - like stars with close planetary companions .",
    "a common envelope phase with a massive planet can expel the stellar envelope and form a low - mass wd .",
    "the planet may ( not ) survive the common envelope phase . however , if there are additional planets in wide orbits , they are likely to survive @xcite .",
    "both scenarios proposed by @xcite and @xcite suggest that low - mass wds may have planets . here",
    "we present a _",

    "therefore , the observed excess flux is most likely not intrinsic to the wd environment .      the usual method for estimating the upper mass limit for substellar companions in photometric surveys is to calculate the total age of the white dwarf , i.e. the wd cooling age plus the ms lifetime , and then use evolutionary models for substellar objects and giant planets to predict their brightness at the age and distance of the wd ( see for example",

    "but there is a problem for low mass wds : if they form through common envelope evolution , it is not possible to know their progenitor mass and their ms lifetimes .",

    "even if the low - mass wds form directly from single metal - rich progenitors , currently we do not have initial - final mass relations that would give us progenitor masses and lifetimes for such systems .",
    "therefore , all we can do is to calculate companion upper mass limits for a range of possible ages starting from the wd cooling ages to several gyr .",
    "all of the objects in our sample are hotter than 10,000 k ( table 1 ) , therefore their wd cooling ages are less than 350 myr @xcite .    a relatively massive planet or brown dwarf can stay hot and easily detectable by @xmath20 for billions of years .",
    "some brown dwarfs or planets may also be reheated during the red giant phase of the progenitor s evolution , either by direct radiation or by impacts from planets and debris belts destabilized during stellar mass loss @xcite .",
    "collisions between two planets may create mergers that would essentially reset the cooling clock of the planet and make the remnant planet overluminous by a factor of a hundred .",
    "however , @xcite predict that only about 2% of young wds may have overluminous planetary companions that form through collisions .",
    "@xcite report the discovery of a unique first - ascent giant star with a substantial dust disk .",
    "they suggest that the circumstellar material around this star may originate from a common - envelope phase with a low - mass stellar or substellar companion .",

    "the discovery of a close - in substellar companion to the low - mass wd 0137@xmath5049 implies that this substellar companion has gone through a common - envelope phase that resulted in the ejection of the envelope of the progenitor first - ascent giant star @xcite .",
    "if the first - ascent giant stars with gaseous / dusty disks are common and if these stars form low - mass single wds , then these wds may have second generation planets as well .",

    "@xcite predict that if a substellar object with @xmath62 goes through a common - envelope phase with a star , it will either evaporate or spiral - in during the process .",
    "more massive objects are expected to survive this evolution , as evidenced by wd 0137@xmath5049b",
    "( @xmath63 , * ? ? ? * ) , although the theoretical 32 @xmath22 limit needs to be tested by observations .",
    "@xcite use wd 1614 + 136 to demonstrate that their common envelope phase scenario is feasible .",
    "they assume that wd 1614 + 136 is a remnant of a 1 @xmath64 star with a core - mass of 0.33@xmath64 .",
    "they find that the minimum companion mass required to expel the envelope of the progenitor is 21 @xmath22 .",
    "no companion is detected in irac observations of this star , and @xcite rule out @xmath65 companions for ages @xmath66 gyr .",
    "this limit goes up to about 40 @xmath22 for 5 gyr old companions .",
    "a well tuned scenario involving a common envelope phase between a @xmath675 gyr old 1 @xmath64 star and a 21 - 40 @xmath22 brown dwarf at a certain orbital separation can explain the single , low - mass wd 1614 + 136 .",
    "our survey is sensitive to massive brown dwarf companions around the majority of our targets even at 5 gyr ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we rule out @xmath68 companions around 8 of our targets at 5 gyr . like wd 1614 + 136 ,",
    "only a well tuned common - envelope phase scenario involving 20 - 40 @xmath22 companions would explain the low mass wds in our sample .",
    "@xcite find that the driest part ( the minimum number ) of the brown dwarf desert occurs at 31 @xmath22 .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the scenario proposed by @xcite will explain all single , low - mass wds .",
    "however , given the caveats in understanding the common - envelope phase evolution and our age dependent limits on possible companions , we can not rule out this scenario .    an alternative scenario for the formation of single low - mass wds involves binary mergers of even lower mass wds @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that such mergers result in rotational velocities on the order of 1000 km s@xmath58 , unless the wds are efficient in loosing angular momentum through mass loss during the merging process .",
    "@xcite measure rotational velocities of 50 km s@xmath58 for two single low - mass wds and they suggest that efficient angular momentum loss should take place if these wds formed through binary mergers .",
    "@xcite find this formation scenario unlikely .",
    "currently , there are no known binary low - mass wd progenitor systems with combined mass @xmath69 and with merger time shorter than a hubble time ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    ". radial velocity studies of extremely low - mass ( @xmath70 ) wds are therefore important to search for such systems @xcite and to see if this scenario is likely to explain at least a fraction of single , low - mass wds .",
