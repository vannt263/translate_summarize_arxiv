    "the last decade has seen a renewed interest in theoretical and experimental investigations on fundamental studies of open quantum systems .",
    "the reasons for such interest are manifold . on the one hand",
    ", we have witnessed a tremendous advance in the development of quantum technologies , stemming from the ability to coherently control in a robust and efficient manner the dynamics of an ever increasing number of particles .",
    "quantum technologies need to be scalable to reach the market , which entails understanding and minimizing environment - induced decoherence effects in order to achieve the required thresholds for error correction . on the other hand",
    "the environment itself has been proven to be experimentally controllable and modifiable . nowadays",
    "reservoir engineering techniques are used for both minimizing the effects of environmental noise and as testbeds of theoretical models .",
    "all recent investigations on open quantum systems dynamics highlight the existence of two different classes of dynamical behavior known as markovian and non - markovian regimes .",
    "historically , in the quantum domain markovian dynamics has been associated to the semigroup property of the dynamical map describing the system evolution .",
    "if one thinks in terms of a microscopic model of system , environment and interaction , a markovian description of the open system requires a number of assumptions , such as system - reservoir weak coupling , and leads to a master equation in the so - called lindblad form @xcite . in certain scenarios , however ,",
    "such approximations are not justified and one needs to go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "it is clear that , due to the general complexity of the problem to be studied , exact solutions exist only for simple open quantum systems models such as the well - known jaynes - cummings model @xcite , the quantum brownian motion model @xcite , and certain pure dephasing models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "despite the fact that these models are often idealized versions of what can be implemented in current experiments , it is undoubtedly very important to fully understand and study these systems and compare the theoretical predictions with experimental implementations .",
    "one of the first features that emerges from the analysis of exact models is that memory effects , usually associated to re - coherence and information backflow , are not connected to the semigroup property of the dynamical map , but are rather associated to the more general property known as divisibility , as discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . in this spirit ,",
    "a non - markovianity measure quantifying the deviation from divisibility has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . other measures ( and corresponding definitions )",
    "are based on the behavior of quantities such as distinguishability between quantum states , as measured , e.g. , by trace distance @xcite or fidelity @xcite , quantum mutual information between initial and final state @xcite , channel capacities @xcite , fisher information @xcite , and the volume of accessible physical states of a system @xcite .",
    "what one defines as markovian or non - markovian dynamics is , in a sense , a question of semantics .",
    "it is tautologic to say that , in general , different definitions and corresponding measures of non - markovianity do not coincide .",
    "we prefer to follow a more pragmatic approach .",
    "we will not insist on the concept of the bestdefinition of non - markovianity but we rather look at different measures as descriptions of different properties of the open quantum systems .    our study will encompass the rivas , huelga , pleanio ( rhp ) divisibility measure of @xcite , the breuer , laine , piilo ( blp ) distinguishability measure @xcite , the luo , fu , song ( lfs ) coherent information measure @xcite , and the bylicka , chruciski , maniscalco ( bcm ) channel capacity measures @xcite .",
    "we will first consider the case of one and two qubits immersed in independent and common purely dephasing environments .",
    "we will then extend our analysis to the study of dissipative environments , again for single qubit and two qubits .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing both the definitions and properties of the non - markovianity measures used in the paper ( sec .",
    "ii ) and their properties and physical meaning ( sec .",
    "iii ) . in secs .",
    "iv and v we present the results of the dynamics of single qubit and two qubits interacting with pure dephasing and amplitude damping environment , respectively . finally , sec .",
    "vi summarises the results and presents conclusions .",
    "let us begin by recalling basic definitions of the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix , describing the state of an open quantum system , is given by a @xmath0-parametrized family of completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps @xmath1 , known as the dynamical map : @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the density matrix of the open system at the initial time @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamical map is divisible when it can be written as the composition of two cptp maps @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "non - divisibility therefore occurs if there exist times @xmath7 at which @xmath8 is not cptp .",
    "a common feature of all non - markovianity measures described in the following subsections is that they are based on the non - monotonic time evolution of certain quantities occurring when the divisibility property is violated .",
    "however , while non - monotonic behavior of such quantities always implies non - divisibility , the inverse is not true , i.e. , there can be non - divisible maps consistent with monotonic dynamics . in this sense , if one would assume divisibility as the definition of non - markovianity , all the other non - markovianity measures should be considered as non - markovianity witnesses .      with the defining attribute of all non - markovian dynamics in mind , namely the violation of the divisibilty property , rivas , huelga and plenio",
    "propose a measure based on the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite .",
    "the inability to write the dynamical map @xmath9 as a concatenation of two independent cptp maps connects with intuitive reasoning of present dynamics being dependent on memory effects .    for master equations written in the standard lindblad form but with time - dependent coefficients , & = & _ t _",
    "-i[h(t),_t ] + & + & _ k _ k(t ) ( v_k(t ) _ t v^_k(t)-\\{v_k^(t)v_k(t),_t } ) , it is possible to show that the corresponding dynamical map satisfies divisibilty if and only if @xmath10 .",
    "if on the other hand , @xmath11 becomes temporarily negative , there will exist an intermediate map @xmath8 which is not cptp , defying the composition law .    according to the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite",
    ", @xmath8 is completely positive if and only if : ( _ t , t)0 , where @xmath12 is a maximally entangled state of the open system with an ancilla . in light of this",
    ", one can quantify non - markovianity by considering the departure of the intermediate map from a map which is completely positive @xcite : _ = _ 0^",
    "dtg(t ) , [ rhp_one ] where [ g ] g(t)=_0^+ .",
    "and @xmath13 encapsulates the time elapsed between the initial time @xmath7 to the final time @xmath0 .",
    "the notation @xmath14 refers to the trace - norm .",
    "mathematically , an apparent advantage of this measure is that no optimization over states is required .",
    "the measure is most simple to calculate using only the specific form of the master equation .",
    "however , eq . ( [ g ] ) may be also calculated in terms of the intermediate dynamical map @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we note here , in ref .",
    "@xcite , another measure based on criteria quantifying the deviation from markovianity for quantum channels has been introduced .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , breuer , laine and piilo introduce a measure based on the non - monotonicity of the trace distance in order to connect non - markovian dynamics with a back - flow of information .",
    "the construction is based on the time evolution of the trace distance between two initial states , describing their relative distinguishability .",
    "the trace distance is contractive under cptp maps therefore , for a divisible process , distinguishability of two initial states @xmath15 decreases continuously over time .",
    "hence , the derivative of the trace distance , that can be seen as measuring the change of information content on the system , i.e. the information flux , is negative . in formulas ( t,^1,2_0)=d(_t^1,_t^2 )",
    "0 , where d(^1_t,^2_t)=|^1_t-^2_t | , is the trace distance between two states @xmath16 and @xmath17 evolving under the influence of a certain divisible dynamical map @xmath18 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite then define as non - markovian a process for which , for certain time intervals , @xmath19 , i.e. , information flows back into the system .    following this ,",
    "the measure of non - markovianity @xmath20 is found by summing over all periods of non - monotonicity of the information flux , including an optimization over all pairs of initial states of the system : _ ( _ t)=_^1,2_0_>0dt(t,^1,2_0 ) .",
    "non - markovian processes defined in this way are always non - divisible , however the converse is not necessarily true @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the non - additivity of this measure has been numerically proven , highlighting the challenge presented when one wishes to consider higher dimensional systems of qubits @xcite-@xcite .",
    "proofs of specific mathematical attributes of the optimal state pairs have to some degree eased the numerical challenges of this calculation by elimating regions of the @xmath21-dimensional hilbert space one should consider @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the states which maximize the measure must lie on the boundary of the space of physical states and must be orthgonal .",
    "finally , we note that in the spirit of this measure , trace distance is not a unique monotone distance and one may also use others such as the statistical distance @xcite .",
    "luo , fu and song in ref .",
    "@xcite introduce a measure of non - markovianity based on the monotonicity property characterizing the time - evolution of correlations between system and ancilla when the dynamics are divisible .",
    "they focus on the total correlations , including both classical and quantum , captured by the quantum mutual information i(_sa)=s(_s)+s(_a)-s(_sa ) , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are marginal states of a system and ancilla , respectively , and @xmath24 is von neumann entropy of state @xmath25 .",
    "the definition of this measure of non - markovianity goes as follows _",
    "( ) = _ ^sa _ i > 0 i(_t^sa ) dt , [ troppocomplicata ] done over all possible initial states @xmath26 with arbitrary hilbert space of the ancilla and @xmath27 .",
    "the authors insist that the optimization of the formula above is done over all possible initial states @xmath26 , where not only the state of the ancilla but also its hilbert space is arbitrary .",
    "of course this makes the optimization problem extremely complicated .",
    "therefore the authors @xcite also propose a simpler version of this measure without optimization @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is an arbitrary maximally entangled state .",
    "here we propose a slight simplification , a measure that is more general than eq .",
    "( [ tropposemplice ] ) but simpler than eq .",
    "( [ troppocomplicata ] ) , and still has a significant interpretation .",
    "when the initial state @xmath26 is pure , and also the initial state of the environment with which the system is interacting , one can rewrite @xmath31 as the mutual information between the input and output of the channel defining the system evolution , [ ni ] i ( , _ t)=s()+s(_t ) -s(,_t ) , with @xmath24 the von neumann entropy of the input state , @xmath32 the entropy of the output state and @xmath33 the entropy exchange , i.e. , the entropy at the output of the complementary channel @xmath34 .",
    "now the non - markovianity measure reads as _ ( ) = _ _ i > 0 i(,_t ) dt .",
    "the main advantage of @xmath35 over the original measure @xmath36 is that the optimization has to be done only over the input state of the system .      in ref .",
    "@xcite two measures that link non - markovian dynamics with an increase in the efficiency of quantum information processing and communication are introduced .",
    "this is motivated by observing that certain capacities of quantum channels are monotonically decreasing functions of time if the channel is divisible .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the connection between the data processing inequality @xcite and the divisibility of the dynamical map . in other words ,",
    "the measures proposed in @xcite can be treated as witnesses of non - markovian dynamics that cause revivals of quantum channel capacities .    in that article",
    "the authors are concerned with two types of capacities .",
    "the first one is the entanglement - assisted classical capacity @xmath37 , which sets a bound on the amount of classical information that can be transmitted along a quantum channel when one allows alice and bob to share an unlimited amount of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is defined in terms of the quantum mutual information @xmath38 between the input and the output of the channel , as given by eq .",
    "( [ ni ] ) , by optimizing over all initial states @xmath25 c_ea(_t)= _ i ( , _ t ) .",
    "[ eq : cea ]    since the entanglement - assisted capacity is monotonically decreasing in time when the channel is divisible , any increase of @xmath37 would indicate violation of the divisibility property and so can be considered as a signature of non - markovianity .",
    "based on this a measure of non - markovianity was introduced @xmath39 where the integral is extended to all time intervals over which @xmath40 is positive .",
    "the measure presents some advantages with respect to , e.g. , @xmath20 .",
    "the first advantage is that the calculation requires optimization only over the input state @xmath25 , while the optimization required in the definition of @xmath20 has to be done over pairs of initial states making it much more complicated to calculate , even knowing that we can restrict ourselves to only orthogonal pairs of states ( having in mind that beyond the one qubit case more than one corresponding orthogonal state may exist ) .",
    "the second advantage is the additivity property .",
    "thanks to the additivity of the mutual information one can prove the additivity of @xmath41 in the case of @xmath21 identical independent channels , i.e. , @xmath42 .      the second quantity discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the quantum capacity @xmath43 .",
    "it gives the limit to the rate at which quantum information can be reliably sent down a quantum channel and is defined in terms of the coherent information between the input and output of the quantum channel @xmath44 @xcite : [ eq : q ] q(_t ) = _ n , with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "following the same line of reasoning done for @xmath37 , a measure of non - markovianity based on the non - monotonic behavior of the quantum capacity was introduced [ nq ] _ = _ > 0 dt ,    it it worth noting that the two measures of non - markovianity based on capacities , in general , do not coincide even for degradable channels .",
    "the distinction between them is actually quite subtle .",
    "we notice indeed that as @xmath46 , with @xmath25 the input state , we have @xmath47 .",
    "therefore a measure based on the violation of the data processing inequality for certain non divisible maps and @xmath48 would not be able to distinguish between an increase in the different types of correlations .",
    "the optimizing state in the definitions ( [ eq : cea ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) , however , is time dependent and does not coincide for the two quantities , hence @xmath49 .",
    "contrarily to the entanglement - assisted classical capacity , the quantum channel capacity is in general not additive .",
    "however , for degradable channels @xcite , the general definition coincides with the one - shot capacity , @xmath50 , and additivity for identical independent channels holds .",
    "in this section we review some properties and physical interpretations of the considered non - markovianity measures .    _",
    "1 ) physical interpretation _",
    "most of the non - markovianity measures discussed here were born from an attempt to quantify and unveil the so - called reservoir memory effects .",
    "the manifestation of such memory effects , stemming from long lasting and non - negligible system - reservoir correlations , leads to a partial recovery of quantum properties previously lost due to the destructive effects of noise induced by the environment .",
    "the blp measure , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , was arguably the first attempt in this direction .",
    "the distinguishability between pairs of states , indeed , can be seen as a way to quantify the amount of information present in a quantum system . the more we know about the system , i.e. , the more information we have , the more we are able to distinguish between quantum states .",
    "the environment s action of continuously monitoring the system gradually causes a loss of information and therefore a decrease of state distinguishability . in this description memory effects",
    "lead to information backflow , i.e. a temporary increase of distinguishability .",
    "it is worth noting here a common abuse of this interpretation .",
    "when talking of blp non - markovianity many authors refer to the flow of information from the system to the environment and then back into the system or , equivalently , of a back flow of information previously lost in the environment .",
    "the blp definition , however , is based on quantities defined on the hilbert space of the system only and in no way takes into account the information content of the environment or how it changes due to the interaction with the system .    in order to answer to this question , and therefore to look at a connection between changes of information in the system and in the environment , we started investigating the capacity - based measures @xcite .",
    "the entropy exchange term appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ni ] ) is indeed the change in entropy of the environment , and the von neumann entropy is one of the most common ways of quantifying the information content of a quantum state .",
    "a similar consideration holds for the lfs measure .",
    "however , while the lfs measure associates non - markovianity to a memory - induced restoration of previously lost total ( quantum + classical ) correlations between an open quantum system and an ancilla , as measured by the mutual quantum information , the capacity - based measures look at a temporary increase of the entanglement assisted and quantum channel capacities .",
    "the latter ones , therefore , physically measure the total increase , due to reservoir memory , of the maximum rate at which information can be transferred in noisy channels for a fixed time interval or a fixed length of the transmission line .    the rhp measure , associated to divisibility , is often criticized for not having a clear physical interpretation and for being rather a mathematical definition than a physical one . here",
    "we would like to conjecture , however , that a physical interpretation can be given in terms of the non - markovian quantum jumps unravelling @xcite . whenever the system can be described in terms of a time - local master equation in lindblad form with time - dependent coefficients , indeed",
    ", one can describe the dynamics of the open system in terms of an ensemble of state vectors whose evolution consists of non - hermition deterministic dynamics interrupted by random quantum jumps with statistics connected to the time - dependent rates of the master equation .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that when the rates become negative , i.e. , the dynamical map is non - divisible and the rhp measure is non - zero , reverse quantum jumps restoring previously lost coherence occur . in this sense reverse jumps",
    "would be the physical manifestation of memory effects quantified by the rhp definition .",
    "reverse quantum jumps always cancel or undo previously occurred jumps and therefore a jump - reverse jump pair describes a virtual process that is in principle not directly observable .    a rigorous mathematical theory linking the rhp and",
    "the blp measures has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , while a general connection between the other measures presently does not exist and , we believe , is unlikely to be found .",
    "_ 2 ) experimental implementability _    simulation of open quantum systems in both markovian and non - markovian regimes is nowadays in the grasp of the experimentalists @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to identify the minimum requirements for implementing experiments measuring non - markovianity .",
    "all non - markovianity measures here studied can not be written in terms of system s observables . presently , all proposed witnesses of non - markovianity rely on the full knowledge of the density matrix at all times @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "so , generally , experiments aimed at revealing one of the measures require quantum process tomography .",
    "but that is not all .",
    "the only measure that does not require an optimization procedure is the rhp measure that , however , assumes the knowledge of either the dynamical map or the explicit form of the master equation . in contrast , the blp , lfs , and bcm measures do not in principle require an assumption on the specific model of open quantum system dynamics .",
    "however this comes with the heavy overload that the optimization should be performed experimentally .",
    "alternatively , one may assume the validity of a given model and solve the optimization problem either numerically or analytically .",
    "in this case it is generally sufficient to know the evolution of the density matrix , so once again process tomography is generally required . from this more realistic perspective",
    "the requirement for experimental implementation of all measurements are comparable .",
    "we conclude by noticing that both the blp and the rhp measures have been experimentally observed in optical experiments simulating pure dephasing environments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "_ 3 ) interest for quantum technologies _",
    "we conclude this section with a few remarks on the potential usefulness of non - markovianity for quantum technologies .",
    "recent results have shown that , in certain circumstances , the manipulation of reservoir spectral properties may lead to improvements in certain quantum technologies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "first of all , it is worth noticing that the improvements demonstrated for quantum metrology @xcite and for quantum key distribution @xcite do hold also when the dynamical map is divisible , i.e. , they are not directly connected to memory effects , as they may occur also when the dynamics is markovian according to the measures here discussed .",
    "other results work instead in the specific case of correlated dephasing environments , where the effect of the noise is known , such as the quantum teleportation scheme of ref .",
    "the only general answer to the question of the connection between certain quantum technologies and non - markovian memory effects is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and was in fact one of the motivations of the introduction of the channel capacity measures . whether or not non - markovianity can be seen as a resource for quantum technologies",
    "is still an open problem and would require rephrasing the question in terms of resource theory .",
    "we hope that such a direction will be the object of future studies .",
    "we begin our analysis by looking at the dynamics of one or two qubits interacting with environments leading to pure dephasing .",
    "note that , as there is no general monotonicity relation between the different non - markovianity measures , it does not make sense to compare their absolute values .",
    "therefore , in the paper we renormalize all measures to take values between zero and 1 , and we look at both their qualitative behavior and the markovian to non - markovian crossover when certain physical parameters of the model are changed .    a microscopic model of the total system - environment dynamics",
    "is presented in refs .",
    "one of the advantages of this model is that it is amenable to an exact solution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will consider initially the case of a single qubit interacting with a reservoir with spectral density of the ohmic class .",
    "the behavior of all non - markovianity measures in this case has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will then extend the analysis to the case of two qubits in both independent and common environments .",
    "both blp and rhp measures have been studied also in this case in ref .",
    "the analysis of the lfs and bcm measures for two qubits is the first result of our paper .    in the following subsection we will present results on the behavior of the four non - markovianity measures here considered .",
    "a thorough comparison and discussion about these results will be given in sec .",

    "often , the more structured is the environment , the greater is the number of negativity intervals and therefore the bigger is the rhp measure .",
    "physically , the number of reverse jumps is increasing too , leading to greater re - coherence .",
    "however , the measure proves problematic for the lorentzian spectrum where , as a direct consequence of the decay rate diverging when the dynamics is non - divisible , the measure diverges .",
    "also , we notice that this measure is additive for independent reservoirs , and the the qualitative behavior for two qubits in either independent and common ( dephasing ) environment is the same . for the other measures the situation is not so straightforward , as we explain below .",
    "we start from the pure dephasing cases , fig .",
    "[ oq ] ( single qubit and two qubits in independent environment ) and fig .",
    "[ tq ] ( 2 qubits in common environment ) show a clear similarity in the behavior of the blp , lfs and bcm measures , in the sense that they all have a peak for values of @xmath57 between 2 and 4 .",
    "this means that manifestations of memory in terms of increase of information on the system , increase of system - ancilla total correlations , or in terms of increase of channel capacities arise in a similar way when modifying the form of the spectrum .    in the common environment case of fig .",
    "[ tq ] , we note that , contrarily to the rhp measure , the other measures show a stronger sensitivity to the distance between the qubits , which in turn is connected to the cross - talk term , i.e. the environment mediated interaction that is known to contribute to the overall memory effects @xcite . the blp , lfs and bcm measures seem to show a narrower peak as the distance is increased , consistently with the independent qubit case of fig . [ oq ] .",
    "the amplitude damping case presents clear differences and , contrarily to the pure dephasing case , the crossover between markovian and non - markovian is not the same for all the measures .",
    "we note first of all that the presence of energy exchange between the system and the environment introduces a new relevant time scale , or frequency , i.e. the bohr frequency @xmath166 of the two - level system forming the qubit . in the dephasing case",
    "the structure of the spectral density and the presence of peaks in resonance with @xmath166 is not related to the occurrence of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "rather , it is the form of the spectrum at the origin @xmath217 that dictates the presence or not of re - coherence and revivals of information @xcite .",
    "the situation is clearly different in the dissipative case where the qubit is more likely to interact with environmental modes of the same frequency of @xmath166",
    ". a clear sign of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ ad ] ii ) for the photonic band gap case . here",
    "all non - markovianity indicators display the same key feature , i.e. , they have their maximum around @xmath218 , where the coupling between the qubit and the modes is the strongest @xcite . in this case , indeed , the qubit exchanges periodically energy with the environment and its population shows rabi oscillations .",
    "consistently , memory effects associated to the energy exchange between system and environment also lead to oscillations of the information content of the system ( back flow of information ) , total correlations between system and ancilla , and channel capacities .",
    "finally , another important point to notice emerges from the comparison of the ( finite ) measures for the lorentzian model on resonance . here",
    "the behavior of the blp and entanglement - assisted capacity is similar while for the quantum channel capacity measure , a much stronger coupling with the environment is required to have a partial increase in the maximum rate of information transfer for increasing times or lengths of the channel . as we have discussed in sec .",
    "v b , this is not surprising as quantum information is more sensitive to environmental noise than classical information .",
    "the overall picture that surfaces is one in which , despite the obvious differences between the measures , their corresponding physical mechanisms contributing to memory effects often appear correlated and show a similar connection with the reservoir spectral features . in conclusion",
    "the non - markovianity measures give different perspectives on the same complex physical process , a full understanding of which requires them all .",
