    "<S> first , we show that for every closed riemannian surface of genus  @xmath0 and area normalized to  @xmath1 , there are at least  @xmath2 homotopically independent loops based at the same point of length at most  @xmath3 , where  @xmath4 is a universal constant . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , this result substantially improves theorem  @xmath5 of m.  gromov in @xcite . on the other hand , it recaptures </S>",
    "<S> the result of s.  sabourau on the separating systole in @xcite and refines his proof .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we show that for any two integers  @xmath6 with  @xmath7 , every connected metric graph  @xmath8 of first betti number  @xmath9 and of length  @xmath9 contains at least  @xmath10 homologically independent loops based at the same point and of length at most  @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this result extends bollobs - szemerdi - thomason s  @xmath12 bound on the homological systole to at least  @xmath12 homologically independent loops based at the same point </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , we give examples of graphs where this result is optimal . </S>"
