    "neutron stars represent the compact remains of massive stars after their supernova explosion and collapse .",
    "consisting largely of neutron matter , neutron stars form highly compact astrophysical objects .",
    "therefore it is essential to take into account the curvature of space - time induced by the large concentration of mass .",
    "coupling the nuclear matter to gravity as described by general relativity ( gr ) or generalized theories of gravity then leads to a consistent theoretical approach to study neutron stars and their properties .    a current major unknown in such studies",
    "is the proper treatment of nuclear matter under extreme conditions as encountered inside a neutron star . here",
    "numerous equations of state ( eoss ) for the nuclear matter have been proposed and employed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of the eos determines the size of the neutrons stars and the maximal value of the mass .",
    "the observations of neutron stars with masses of @xmath0 @xcite therefore provide a strong constraint for the physically viable eoss .    while the physical properties of neutron stars typically depend strongly on the chosen eos , in recent years the study of eos independent  or almost independent  neutron star characteristics came into the focus .",
    "notably , the @xmath1-love @xmath2 relations for neutron stars represent universal relations that hold between the scaled moment of inertia , the love number , and the scaled quadrupole moment in einstein gravity @xcite . also for quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of neutron stars",
    "universal relations concerning frequency and damping time have been found @xcite .    whereas most studies of neutron star properties have been performed within gr , generalized models of gravity",
    "have also been considered ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , neutron stars represent an excellent testing ground for such generalized models of gravity . while scalar - tensor theories ( stts ) , for instance , can lead to results very close to those of gr , certain stts",
    "also allow for the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization , yielding neutron stars with considerably larger masses in the presence of a non - trivial scalar field @xcite .",
    "here we consider neutron stars in dilatonic einstein - gauss - bonnet ( degb ) theory .",
    "this theory is motivated from string theory , a leading candidate for a quantum theory of gravity and a unified description of the fundamental interactions of nature .",
    "string theory predicts the presence of higher curvature terms in the action as well as further fields .",
    "in particular , the low energy effective action obtained from heterotic string theory contains as basic ingredients a gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term and a dilaton field @xcite . as an attractive feature of degb theory the quadratic curvature terms in the action",
    "still lead to only second order equations of motion .",
    "properties of static neutron stars in degb theory were first considered in @xcite . studying neutron stars for three eoss",
    "it was shown , that the maximum mass of the neutron stars decreases as the gb coupling constant is increased .",
    "interestingly , the sequences of static neutron stars can not be extended beyond a critical value of the central density , which depends on the gb coupling strength and on the eos . here a vanishing radicant is encountered in the expansion of the dilaton field at the origin @xcite .",
    "this behavior therefore leads to eos dependent constraints on the gb coupling @xcite . in the case of slow rotation",
    "a perturbative study allows for the extraction of the moment of inertia of neutron stars . generalizing the corresponding gr derivation @xcite ,",
    "the moment of inertia was calculated in degb theory in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the moment of inertia decreases with increasing gb coupling .",
    "recently , also qnms of neutron stars were studied in degb theory @xcite , showing that the frequency of the modes is increased by the presence of the gb term .    rapidly rotating neutron stars",
    "have been studied extensively in gr ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however , in generalized theories of gravity the investigation of rapidly rotating neutron stars has only begun recently ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , where much progress was achieved in stts @xcite and first results were obtained in degb theory @xcite .",
    "the physically relevant domain of neutron stars is delimited by the set of static neutron stars , by the set of neutron stars along the secular instability line , which possess maximum mass for fixed angular momentum , and by the set of neutron stars rotating at the kepler limit .    here",
    "we construct for the first time the full physically relevant domain for rapidly rotating neutron stars in degb theory , employing two well - known eoss @xcite .",
    "we discuss the dependence of the mass on the radius and on the central density .",
    "we consider the compactness , the angular momentum , the rotation period and the dilaton charge .",
    "we extract the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment of these neutron stars , and analyze the corresponding universal relation .",
    "finally we discuss the deformation of the rapidly rotation neutron stars .",
    "for all these physical properties we analyze the dependence on the gb coupling strength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we exhibit the action , the field equations , the anstze , the boundary conditions and the definitions of the physical quantities , while we present our main results on rapidly rotating neutron stars in degb theory in section iii .",
    "section iv gives our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the appendix sketches our derivation of the quadrupole moment for neutron stars .",
    "here we first motivate and recall the action of degb theory .",
    "we exhibit the equations of motion for the metric and the dilaton field as well as the constraint equations for the stress energy tensor .",
    "subsequently , we present the stationary axially symmetric ansatz for the metric . for the neutron star matter",
    "we assume a perfect fluid in uniform rotation , described by a polytropic eos . since we work with dimensionless",
    "coordinates we discuss our choice of the dimensionful scales to obtain the corresponding physical values of the observables .",
    "we recall how to extract the global charges and the quadrupole moment from the asymptotic expansions of the functions , and we describe how we analyze the size and the shape of the neutron stars .",
    "today string theory represents a promising approach towards quantum gravity and a unified description of the fundamental interactions . in string theory modifications of gr",
    "arise , which can be incorporated into an effective low energy action .",
    "in particular , in heterotic string theory a gauss - bonnet term arises , which is coupled to a modulus field , the dilaton @xcite .",
    "moreover , lorentz - chern - simons terms and kalb - ramond axions are present .",
    "( for more recent discussions on the low energy effective action and its maximally symmetric solutions see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "the low energy effective action has received much attention in connection with black holes . based on the inclusion of various parts of the effective action , numerous static and slowly rotating black hole solutions",
    "have been found ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as well as rapidly rotating ones ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . also string theory corrections of further compact objects",
    "have been considered ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    motivated by the low - energy heterotic string theory action @xcite , we here employ a certain simplified action , which has been considered previously for black holes @xcite and wormholes @xcite .",
    "in particular , this action retains only the dilaton and the gb term in addition to the einstein - hilbert action , while it neglects the lorentz - chern - simons and axion terms ( as well as gauge fields and possible matter - dilaton couplings ) and treats spacetime as effectively four - dimensional , assuming no light compactification moduli .",

    "@xmath152 has been extracted for the keplerian sequence of eleven eoss , including the eos fps .",
    "for all eoss considered the maximal value reached for @xmath152 is about 0.7 , i.e. , distinctly below the kerr value . moreover , except for large values of the mass , the reduced dimensionless angular momentum @xmath152 varies only little with the mass .",
    "for the eos employed here , we observe a somewhat different behavior , which may arise from their polytropic character @xcite .",
    "the rotation periods @xmath104 of the known pulsars lie within the interval @xmath155 ms @xmath156 s , i.e. , the rotation period of the fastest known pulsar corresponds to only 1.4 ms .",

    "interestingly , close to the maximum mass , the period of neutron stars along the keplerian sequence is larger than the period along the secular instability line .",
    "therefore the boundary line exhibits a loop close to the maximum mass .",
    "in contrast to neutron stars in gr , neutron stars in degb theory possess a scalar charge due to the presence of the dilaton field .",
    "this dilaton charge @xmath74 has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ exdil ] ) .",
    "the presence of a scalar charge was addressed before in @xcite , where it was shown , that neutron stars do not possess a scalar charge in degb theory , when the dilaton is coupled only linearly to the gb term .",
    "in contrast , for the exponential coupling employed here a small dilaton charge arises for neutron stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the dilaton charge @xmath74 as a function of the mass @xmath72 for gb coupling constants @xmath110 and 2 . for neutron stars of small masses",

    "we observe that there is little dependence on @xmath6 along most of the keplerian sequence , while along the secular instability line the quadrupole moment is larger for larger values of @xmath6 , when compared at the same mass .",
    "let us now consider the quadrupole moment for a different set of sequences of neutron stars , where we fix the reduced dimensionless angular momentum @xmath152 , eq .",

    "we also observe a pronounced dependence on @xmath6 for the larger angular velocities .    clearly , the physical properties of neutron stars possess typically a pronounced dependence on the chosen eos .",
    "however , in recent years much effort has concentrated on the study of quantities , which are independent of the eos , or better , almost independent of the eos .",
    "a prominent example are the so - called @xmath1-love @xmath2 relations for neutron stars which represent universal relations holding between the scaled moment of inertia , the love number , and the scaled quadrupole moment in einstein gravity @xcite .",
    "these relations have been considered first for the slowly rotating case @xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1-@xmath2 relation between the scaled moment of inertia @xmath162 @xmath163 and the scaled quadrupole moment @xmath164 @xmath165 has yielded a mean square fit for the function @xmath166 , from which the values of any of the large number of different eoss employed differ by less than one percent @xcite .    for the generalization to rapidly rotating neutron stars ,",
    "it has turned out , that one needs to consider the relation @xmath166 at fixed values of the reduced dimensionless angular momentum @xmath152 in order to obtain near eos independence @xcite .",
    "this is the reason , that we have considered the fixed @xmath152 sequences in fig .",

    "[ fig6](b ) for a fixed value of @xmath161 both for the eos di - ii and the eos fps @xcite .",
    "clearly , the dependence of the @xmath167-@xmath164 relation on the equation of state ( for fixed @xmath6 ) is very weak , although it increases slightly with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "thus the degb theory possesses basically the same universal @xmath1-@xmath2 relation as gr .",
    "similar findings were obtained in stt @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us finally address the deformation and the shape of rapidly rotating neutron stars . since the centrifugal forces deform the neutron stars , their equatorial radius @xmath90 increases and the neutron stars flatten .",
    "to give an invariant account of this deformation we consider the ratio of the polar radius @xmath91 to the equatorial radius @xmath90 , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ r_p ] ) and ( [ r_e ] ) , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show this ratio versus the mass for @xmath110 and 2 for both eoss employed . as expected the deformation is strongest along the keplerian sequence , when the star gets unstable with respect to losing mass .    to visualize the geometry of the surface of the neutron stars we calculate the isotropic embedding of the surface for several examples .",
    "we exhibit the isotropic embedding in figs .",
    "[ fig11em ] , where we choose for each eos one star close to the secular instability line and one star close to the kepler limit and the gb coupling @xmath110 . for the stars rotating close to the kepler limit",
    "a cusp will develop at the surface in the equatorial plane , when the limit is reached .",
    "the distribution of the energy density @xmath15 is another physical quantity of interest .",
    "we therefore exhibit contours of constant energy density versus the coordinates @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) in figs .",

    "we choose the same neutron star solutions for the contours of the energy density as for the isotropic embeddings .",

    "the gb coupling has the value @xmath110 .",
    "the inner structure of these neutron stars is illuminated further in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] , where we exhibit colour encoded plots for the energy density for the same set of examples and order of the figures as in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "we have considered rapidly rotating neutron stars in degb theory , a generalized model of gravity inspired by heterotic string theory .",
    "whereas static and slowly rotating neutron stars have been studied before in this theory , we have here obtained for the first time the full domain of physically relevant neutron stars and its dependence on the gb coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "delimited by the static and keplerian sequences as well as by the secular instability line , our results show that this domain decreases as the gb coupling constant @xmath6 increases . employing dimensionless quantities",
    "we have chosen two values for the dimensionless @xmath6 ( eq .  ( [ ab ] ) , @xmath110 and 2 , which are below the observational limit ( @xmath174 ) obtained from binaries @xcite and below the limit ( @xmath175 ) obtained from the study of static neutron stars in degb theory @xcite .",
    "the latter limit arises from the fact that if we were to increase @xmath6 further , we would soon encounter a genuine degb effect known for black holes , wormholes and neutron stars @xcite : somewhere along the sequences of neutrons stars the solutions would stop existing , since the dilaton equation would no longer yield a real solution , leading to a completely different type of boundary for the domain of rotating neutron stars and also to a limit on @xmath6 @xcite .    for the eos of the neutron stars we have selected two simple examples , the eos di - ii @xcite and an approximation to the eos fps @xcite ,",
    "both representing polytropic eoss widely used before in the calculation of neutron stars . since both eoss do not yield a maximum mass of @xmath128 in the static case and for slow rotation",
    ", the present studies should be extended to investigate further eoss , yielding higher masses . in the static case , this has already been achieved in @xcite for a set of eight realistic eoss . for the rapidly rotating case , however , the current numerical scheme will need to be revised first in order to achieve higher efficiency .",
    "this also holds for a further increase of the gb coupling constant @xmath6 .    concerning the dependence of the physical properties of the neutron stars on the gb coupling @xmath6 we note that the maximum masses are smaller for larger values of @xmath6 while the minimum radii are larger . for the smaller masses and larger radii",
    "the kepler limit is ( almost ) independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the compactness of the neutron stars decreases with increasing @xmath6 . besides the global charges mass and angular momentum , neutron stars in degb theory carry also a scalar charge , the dilaton charge .",
    "this scalar charge arises only because of the exponential coupling of the dilaton to the gb term .",
    "in contrast , for a linear coupling the scalar charge would vanish @xcite . for exponential coupling",
    "therefore scalar dipole radiation would arise in a compact binary system whether or not one of the constituents is a black hole @xcite .",
    "for the quadrupole moment of neutron stars we have employed the definition of geroch and hansen @xcite , giving a brief derivation of the quadrupole moment in appendix a. the resulting expression corresponds to the expression for kerr - newman black holes , when the electric charge is replaced by the scalar charge .",
    "the quadrupole moment exhibits a pronounced dependence on the eos and on the gb coupling .",
    "the same is true for the moment of inertia .",
    "the moment of inertia and the quadrupole moment are known to exhibit a universal relation in gr for slowly rotating neutron stars @xcite as well as for rapidly rotating neutron stars , when the angular momentum is appropriately fixed @xcite .",
    "we have shown , that in degb theory neutron stars satisfy basically the same @xmath1-@xmath2 relation as in gr , presenting only a very weak dependence on the gb coupling @xmath6 .    finally , we have addressed the deformation of the neutron stars which arises because of the rotation . for neutron stars close to the kepler limit ,",
    "one notices the formation of a cusp at the surface in the equatorial plane . here",
    "mass shedding would occur when the kepler limit is exceeded . clearly , this phenomenon is independent of the gb coupling ( as long as neutron stars rotating at the kepler limit exist in degb theory ) .",
    "turning now to future extensions of this work , first of all a more efficient numerical code should be developed , which should allow the study of rapidly rotating neutron stars for a larger number of eoss as well as the determination of the domain of existence of neutron star solutions at large gb coupling .    from a string theoretical point of view",
    ", it would be very interesting to include further terms into the action . here ,",
