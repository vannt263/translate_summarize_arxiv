    "various astrophysical and cosmological observations provide convincing evidences for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "dark matter distribution spans in wide range of scales from galaxy to clusters of galaxies and the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "recently , anomalous x - ray line emissions have been observed from galaxy clusters and also in the andromeda galaxy  @xcite . while those might be a result of systematic effects , it would be interesting if the line came from the new source of astrophysical phenomena or from new physics .",
    "it was suggested that the signal might come from decaying dark matter with the mass and lifetime , @xmath2 assuming that they are the dominant component of dark matter .",
    "some theoretically interesting particle models have been suggested such as sterile neutrino  @xcite , exciting dark matter  @xcite , millicharged dark matter  @xcite , axion like particle  @xcite , in the effective theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the warm dark matter axino in a r - parity violating supersymmetric model . with bilinear r - parity breakings , neutralinos mix with neutrinos and",
    "thus the axino can decay into photon and neutrino .",
    "we find that the axino mass with @xmath3 kev can have the proper lifetime and relic density for the x - ray line emission . in this scenario , as an interesting consequence , the upper bound on the neutrino mass imposes that the bino mass is lighter than about @xmath4 gev .    in section  [ axino ]",
    "we introduce the model of axino dark matter and in section  [ rparity ] we consider the r - parity violation and decay of axinos .",
    "we summarize in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the strong cp problem and the hierarchy problem in the standard model can be naturally solved in the supersymmeric axion model  @xcite .",
    "if axino , the fermionic superpartner of axion , is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , then it is a good candidate of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the effective operator of the axino can be derived by the supersymmetric transformation of the axion interactions and is given by @xmath5\\tilde{g}^b g^b_{\\mu\\nu }   + i\\frac{\\alpha_yc_{ayy}}{16\\pi { f_{a}}}\\overline{{{\\tilde{a } } } }   \\gamma_5[\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu ] \\tilde{y}y_{\\mu\\nu } ,   \\label{eq : laxino}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the peccei - quinn breaking scale , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the gauge couplings , gaugino fields and the field strength for @xmath13 and @xmath14 gauge groups respectively .",
    "the mass of axino is expected to be of the order of gravitino mass , but it can be much smaller  @xcite , or much larger  @xcite than the typical supersymmetric particle mass scale , depending on the specific models  @xcite . here",
    "we take the light axino mass of the order of kev as dark matter component .",
    "the primordial axinos are generated from the thermal plasma during reheating after the primordial inflation .",
    "if the reheating temperature is lower than the decoupling temperature  @xcite @xmath15 the axinos can not reach the thermal equilibrium . then axinos are generated through scatterings and decay of heavy particles in the thermal plasma , and the amount could be abundant enough for axino to be the dominant dark matter component  @xcite .",
    "the abundance of thermally produced axinos depends on the reheating temperature for the ksvz axion model  @xcite  . the axino number density to entropy density ratio",
    "is estimated as  @xcite @xmath16 with this , the relic density of non - relativistic axino at present is given by @xmath17 we can find that @xmath18 axino can be a natural candidate for warm dark matter when the reheating temperature is around @xmath19 and peccei - quinn scale @xmath20 .",
    "such thermally produced kev axino is a warm dark matter candidate   and may solve various problems at the small scale in cold dark matter model  @xcite .",
    "this range of reheating temperature is free from the gravitino problem  @xcite .",
    "we consider the bilinear type r - parity violation with the usual @xmath21 -term superpotential in the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are chiral super fields of the lepton doublet and up - type higgs doublet and @xmath25 parameterizes the size of the r - parity violation . by redefining the @xmath23 and @xmath26",
    ", we can eliminate the r - parity violating term in  eq .",
    "( [ wp ] ) , then r - parity violating effect appears only in the scalar potential  @xcite , @xmath27 where the coefficients are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from this scalar potential , the sneutrinos",
    "obtain non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the sneutrino mass .",
    "since the non - zero vevs of sneutrinos induce mixings between leptons and gauginos , the neutrinos mix with neutralinos and can obtain mass at the tree level as  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 parameterizes the r - parity breaking given by @xmath36    the upper bound of the neutrino mass @xmath37 constrains the r - parity breaking parameters .",
    "the baryon asymmetry can be erased in the early universe by the @xmath38 violating interactions  @xcite .",
    "however if one of the lepton flavors of the r - parity violating couplings is preserved and the slepton mixing is small enough , the problem can be avoided  @xcite .    due to the r - parity violation",
    ", the stability of lsp is not guaranteed anymore  @xcite . for bilinear r - parity breakings",
    ", the light axino decays dominantly into photon and neutrino and the decay rate is given by  @xcite @xmath39 where the photino - zino mixing is given by @xmath40 with the neutralino mixing matrix @xmath41 . in the case of @xmath42 , it is simplified to be @xmath43 although axino can also decay to three neutrinos mediated by z - boson , this mode is highly suppressed and negligible .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the relatively large @xmath35 can be inconsistent with the mass of neutrino from eq .",
    "( [ mnu ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] , we show the contour plot of @xmath44 in the plane of @xmath45 . to explain the neutrino mass @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the value in the contour need to be smaller than @xmath49 . that can be obtained when @xmath50 with slight dependence on @xmath51 .",
    "an interesting point to note is that the value of @xmath52 implies light bino @xmath53 for @xmath54 from the upper bound for neutrino mass .",
    "axino is a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "when its mass is around @xmath55 and r - parity is broken bilinearly , the axino decays into photon and neutrino .",
    "we studied this decaying axino warm dark matter in the light of the recent observation of x - ray line emission from the center of galaxy clusters and andromeda galaxy observed by xmm - newton .",
    "we find that the decaying axino can naturally explain the x - ray signal with / without additional component of dark matter .",
    "we note that the neutrino mass bound implies that the bino mass is less than about @xmath4 gev .",
    "as this work was being submitted , a paper  @xcite appeared that also discusses decaying axino dark matter as a source of the x - ray line signal .",
