    "it is well known that making copies of a quantum system ( e.g. with a quantum copier ) does not increase the amount of information present about the original . to put it another way ,",
    "spreading information about the original system onto several systems does not increase the amount of information that one can obtain about the original ( in fact , this usually decreases it due to noise ) .",
    "however , in discussions on this matter it is usually tacitly assumed that one has access to optimal measuring devices .    in practical situations ,",
    "however , this is never the case .",
    "one is always restricted to imperfect measurements , due to inefficient detectors , and various sources of random noise .",
    "although , in theory , quantum mechanics allows one to perfectly distinguish between orthogonal states by making appropriate measurements , in practice distinguishing perfectly every time is impossible .",
    "of course , in many situations these imperfections of measurement are insignificant , but in this article we consider those cases where such inefficiencies are relevant .",
    "let us investigate what can be done in principle if one is restricted to using inefficient and noisy detectors .",
    "in many practical situations what one is interested in is to determine in which one of several possible orthogonal states a system is residing . for example , this is what one does to extract transmitted information from a signal .",
    "the basic idea explored in this article can be expressed as follows : if we can get a second chance to use the detectors at our disposal on the same state , we might do better at distinguishing it from among the range of possibilities .",
    "we will investigate what happens when one makes copies of the original state .",
    "if the available detectors are fairly poor , then one may hope that making even imperfect copies may still give improvements if one can then make independent measurements on each of the copies .",
    "copying machines in general use two approaches .",
    "one of the extreme cases is a classical copying machine , where measurements ( destructive or non - destructive ) are made on the original state , the results of which are then fed as parameters into some state preparation scheme that attempts to construct a copy of the original .",
    "this approach obviously allows one to generate an arbitrary amount of copies , possibly all identical to each other .",
    "the opposite extreme is a fully quantum copying machine that by some process that is unseen by external observers ( a `` black box '' ) , creates a fixed number of copies , usually destroying the original in the process .",
    "naturally in a realistic situation , noise will additionally degrade the quality of the copies , and copiers that utilize both of the processes above are obviously also possible .    since one s detection resources are restricted to imperfect detectors that discard some information about the state , then it becomes immediately obvious that classical copying gains you nothing .",
    "any information about the original state that you can extract from the copies can be extracted just as well from the measurement results used to produce the copies  and these are made with those imperfect detectors .",
    "quantum copying , however , _ is _ able to give improvements , even when degraded by noise and inefficiencies , as will be seen below .    for simplicity , and because the aim is above all to demonstrate the principle at work here , we will consider situations where one wishes to distinguish between two orthogonal possibilities for the input state .",
    "some examples of this would be single - photon detection , distinguishing spins of spin - half particles , single - photon polarization , or distinguishing between some number of photons and no photons .",

    "also , the probability that no photon was present if it was not detected also approaches one .    note that using quantum copiers , and not classical ones is vital .",
    "a classical copier would have to rely on the same imperfect photodetectors , and would actually _ reduce _ the detection efficiency , since to detect a photon at one of the two copy detectors , one must have been first detected at the copier .",

    "it was seen in the previous section that if one intends to make a definite judgment about whether a photon was incident on the ( single ) detector or not , then for some parameter values , the measurement result is no help at all .",

    "( of course if dark counts are very common , it will give only a minute amount ) .",
    "it follows then , that the method of interpreting the results described in the previous section  [ estimator ] ( choosing the most likely possibility ) must be wasting some information about the input state .",
    "let s look instead at the total amount of information about the input state that is contained in the measurement results .",
    "this is the ( shannon ) mutual information @xmath89 per input state between some observer @xmath90 who knows with certainty what the original states are ( perhaps because they were prepared by that observer ) , and another observer @xmath91 who has access to the measurement results of the detection scheme .",

    "it is applicable for all parameter values .",
    "this mutual information has very concrete meaning even though in general , @xmath91 can never be actually certain what any particular input state was .",
    "it is known that by using appropriate block - coding and error - correction schemes , @xmath90 can transmit to @xmath91 an amount of _ certain _ information that can come arbitrarily close to the upper limit @xmath89 imposed by the detection probabilities . in other words",
    ", @xmath89 is the maximum amount of information that @xmath90 and @xmath91 can share using a given detection scheme , if they are cunning enough .",
    "it follows then , that the detection scheme which gives a greater information content about the initial state @xmath89 , will potentially be the more useful one .",
    "the authors have shown that the wootters - zurek ( @xmath31 ) copier is the optimal quantum broadcaster of information when the information is decoded one - symbol at a time @xcite .    from expression  ( [ imexpr ] ) it can be seen that @xmath89 depends on the _ a priori _ input probabilities ( the parameter @xmath4 in the cases considered here ) .",
    "this leads one to surmise that ( at least in general ) various detection schemes may do relatively better or worse depending on how frequently the input is a photon .",
    "this is in fact found to be the case .",
    "however , in what follows , we will concentrate mainly on the @xmath96 case of equiprobable photons and vacuum , since this is the situation that allows the maximum amount of information to be encoded in the original message , and so is in some ways the most basic case .",
    "lastly before we begin analyzing the new detection scheme , since @xmath89 becomes very small when most inputs are of the same type ( mostly photons , or mostly vacuum ) , it is convenient to introduce an effective efficiency @xmath97 of the detection scheme .",
    "if the new detection scheme gives mutual information content @xmath98 per input state , then @xmath99 is defined as the efficiency of a noiseless detector that would give the same mutual information content if it was used by itself in the basic scheme with no copiers .",
    "i.e. @xmath100 @xmath97 is a one - to - one , monotonically increasing function of @xmath89 , and so if ( and only if ) some detection scheme increases @xmath97 , it also increases the mutual information .",
    "thus , @xmath97 and @xmath89 are equivalent for ranking detection schemes in terms of effectiveness .",
    "@xmath97 also has the advantage that for some cases of the new copier - enhanced detection scheme it is independent of the photon input probability @xmath4 .",
    "( notably the basic noiseless ( but possibly inefficient ) case when @xmath36 , and @xmath39 )    now it is time to ask the question : for what parameter values does the copier - enhanced detection scheme provide more information about the initial states than using a single detector ?",
    "consider firstly the simplest case of interest , where there are no spurious ( `` dark '' ) counts in the photodetectors ( @xmath39 ) , and one has a copier of efficiency @xmath27 , that produces vacuum upon failure ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "this will give some idea about the relationship between the detector and copier efficiencies required , leaving the effects of noise for later consideration in sec .",
    "[ noise ] .    as mentioned previously , in this situation",

    "since no random noise is introduced by either copier or detector , improvement is achieved whenever more copiers are added , to arbitrary order @xmath6 .",

    "a few things of interest to note in this figure :    1 .",
    "the copier efficiency required is always above @xmath0 and above @xmath108 .",
    "a gain in efficiency can be achieved even with quite poor copiers  for relatively small detector efficiencies @xmath0 ( which occur for photodetection in practice ) , the copier efficiency required is only slightly above half .",
    "3 .   for very good detectors , to get improvement , the copier efficiency @xmath27 has to be slightly greater than the detector efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "4 .   for low efficiencies ,",
    "the relative gain in efficiency can be very high , and can reach approximately @xmath45 for very poor detectors and very good copiers .    to examine how much improvement can be achieved in more detail ,",
    "consider when the efficiency of the detectors is @xmath109 .",
    "this is a typical efficiency for a pretty good single - photon detector at present .",
    "this is shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ eta0.6fig ] .",
    "note how quite large efficiency gains are achievable even when the copier efficiency is slightly over the threshold useful value of @xmath110 ( from eq .",
    "( [ simplecond ] ) ) , and how adding more copiers easily introduces more gains at first , but after three levels of copiers , adding more becomes a lot of effort for not much gain .",
    "following on from the analysis in sec .  [ i m ] , let us now introduce various types of noise into the detection scheme .",
    "unfortunately nice analytical results like  ( [ effeff ] ) - ( [ simplecond ] ) disappear , so what follows is based on the results of numerical calculations .",
    "additionally , the results now also depend on the photon input probabilities @xmath4 .",
    "firstly consider the effect of dark counts ( @xmath111 ) , while still keeping the copier noiseless ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the regions of efficiency gain and loss with one copier are shown in fig .",
    "[ xifig ] . in real detectors ,",
    "dark counts always occur , but are usually kept quite rare , so realistic values of @xmath87 are of the order of @xmath113 .",
    "thus ( as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ xifig ] ) for likely parameters , dark counts do not reduce the effectiveness of the copier detection scheme by much at all .",
    "next , consider noise in the copier . in our scheme ,",
    "noise is linearly introduced into the copying process by varying the parameter @xmath38 away from @xmath114 .",
    "the amount of noise increases as @xmath38 approaches zero , until only pure noise occurs upon failure of the copying for @xmath35 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath38 of the values of @xmath27 and @xmath0 needed for efficiency gain is shown in fig .",
    "[ mufig ] . in the particular case shown ,",
    "photons and vacuum are equiprobable ( @xmath96 ) and there are no dark counts ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "firstly , it is seen that in most cases@xcite , the optimum output for the copier to produce upon failure is vacuum ( @xmath36 ) , and the worst situation is when it produces photons by default ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "totally random default output ( @xmath35 ) requires the copier inefficiency to be reduced by roughly a factor of two relative to what is permissible for vacuum default output .",
    "unfortunately , little is known to date about how much noise will be inevitably introduced in a practical quantum copier , but it seems reasonable that the default output can be made somewhat ( perhaps significantly ) better than random .",
    "if noise could be made 10% probable ( perhaps not an unreasonable figure ) upon failure to copy , then copiers with efficiency @xmath27 of about @xmath115 would improve detection for typical quantum efficiencies @xmath0 of about @xmath116 or @xmath117 . either way , it is seen that even overwhelming noise upon failure to copy , still allows fairly inefficient ( say @xmath118 ) copiers to improve the detection efficiency .",
    "this is perhaps somewhat unexpected .    since the effective efficiency @xmath97 only varies with photon frequency @xmath4 when noise is present , the next question which arises when considering noisy schemes , is what effect does @xmath4 have on the performance of the new detection scheme ?",
    "[ pfig ] shows regions of efficiency increase in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath0 for a single copier scheme , when it is used on sets of input states containing different proportions of photons @xmath4 .",

    "features seen include    1 .",
    "efficiency is easiest to increase when @xmath4 is close to one , i.e. there are photons coming in most of the time",
    "when photons are rare ( @xmath4 small ) , the copiers have to be very efficient to be useful , since one wants to register almost all of those that do come along .",
    "when photons and vacuum are of a similar frequency , the necessary copier efficiency changes slowly .",
    "( see how the @xmath119 curves are close together ) .",
    "the behaviour exhibited is fairly typical , although @xmath35 appears to be the worst case scenario , as it is the most noisy . in less noisy situations ,",

    "let us consider what properties a quantum copier must have to be useful in this scheme .",
    "the scenario where it is easiest to enhance the detection of information is where the detectors are very weak ( @xmath0 very small ) and there are no dark counts ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "so , if a copier is of no use in this situation , it will not be useful for any detector parameters whatsoever .",
    "this will let us specify the broadest range of copier parameters for which they may be useful in improving detection efficiencies .    in any detection situation , we can choose the basis in which to specify the transformation to be the one in which the detectors measure populations only .",

    "this allows us to write the copying transformation of the two possible input states ( including any noise introduced by experimental factors ) as    @xmath121    where @xmath122    and where , , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 consist only of coherences , so do not contribute to the measurement probabilities , since we have chosen the basis so that what the detectors measure become the populations .",
    "the information about the original states transmitted to the observer with the detectors can be easily calculated using the relations  ( [ pi ] ) ,  ( [ detpovm ] ) ,  ( [ imexpr ] ) , noting that when a copier is present , the povm which describes the combined measurements at both detectors simply consists of all tensor products of the one - detector povm @xmath125 the information with weak detectors , input photon probability @xmath4 , and no copier is @xmath126 and with copier : @xmath127\\log_2 [ pa+(1-p)b],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that depends only on two parameters of the copier @xmath128    fig .",
    "[ copfig ] shows the values of parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 over which copiers are useful for detection enhancement , for various @xmath4 .",
    "some points to note about this figure :    1 .",
    "the diagonal @xmath129 corresponds to ( via  ( [ abim ] ) ) the worst - case situation where no information about the input states is recoverable from the detectors ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "2 .   when @xmath131 , photon inputs create photon outputs more often than vacuum , while if @xmath132 , vacuum inputs create vacuum outputs more often than photons .",
    "thus , the region @xmath131,@xmath132 corresponds to imperfect cloning transformations , while the region @xmath133,@xmath134 corresponds to imperfect swapping transformations which most often transform photons into vacuum , and vacuum into two photons .",
    "relabeling @xmath135 , and @xmath136 in the copying transformation does not keep the recovered information @xmath89 invariant because the detectors do not react the same way to photons and vacuum .",
    "this is why fig .",
    "[ copfig ] is not symmetric about @xmath129 .",
    "4 .   the noisy copying transformation  ( [ copytransf ] ) used in previous sections of this article can be made to correspond to any values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath137 by appropriate choices of @xmath38 and @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , + @xmath138 + and families of such transformations with a set efficiency @xmath27 are parallel to the dividing line @xmath129 .",
    "greater ranges of copiers become useful as @xmath4 ( the _ a priori _ input photon frequency ) becomes larger .",
    "for very low photon frequencies , only the close vicinity of @xmath139 gives improvements .",
    "the wootters - zurek copying machine ( or entangler ) lies at this point @xmath140 , and is the only copying transformation which gives improvement for arbitrary photon frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the well known universal quantum copying machine ( uqcm)@xcite , which reproduces an arbitrary qubit with the best fidelity lies at @xmath141 , outside the region of detection improvement for any @xmath4 , and hence is never useful for the type of detection enhancement scheme discussed here .",
    "thus one can see that quantum copying transformations used in such a detection improvement scheme as outlined here must be similar in their properties to the wootters - zurek copier ( the controlled - not gate ) , and the degree of similarity required depends on the input photon frequency .",
    "we have provided an example of how spreading information about quantum states onto a larger number of subsystems , actually increases the amount of information about the original state that is available to an observer .",
    "the key reason why this occurs is that in realistic situations , observers are always restricted in how close to the ideal their measurements can be .",
    "then , quantum copying the original state may allow the observer to make better use of the detection apparatus at their disposal .",
    "in particular , more efficiency of detection can be gained by employing entangling quantum copiers such as a controlled - not gate .",
    "in fact if the efficiency of the detectors is far from 100% ( such as in single - photon detection ) the copier does not have to be very efficient itself , and significant gains in detection can still be made .    from fig .",
    "[ nen3fig ] , and others , it can be seen that to be useful , the quantum copiers must be successful with an efficiency @xmath27 over 50% and somewhat greater than the detector efficiency @xmath0 .",
    "it is not generally clear how feasible this is for various physical systems , or measurement schemes that one might wish to employ . with current technology",
    "it is often still easier to make measurements on a system , rather than entangling it with other known systems , however this varies from measurement to measurement and from system to system .",
    "the physical processes involved in measurement and quantum copying are often quite different : the former requires creating a correlation between a quantum system and a macroscopic pointer , whereas the latter involves creating quantum entanglement between two similar microscopic states .",
    "efficient detection depends on correlating the system with its environment in a strong , yet controlled way , whereas quantum copying depends on isolating the system from its environment .",
    "one thus supposes that the usefulness of a scheme such as the one outlined here will depend on the system and measurements in question , due to the relative ease of implementing detection and controlled quantum evolution in those systems .",
    "the copier parameters required for usefulness of the proposed scheme when random noise is present are found to depend somewhat on the relative frequency of the various states to be distinguished . in any case , the copying transformation must be similar to a controlled - not gate , the exact degree of similarity depending on the relative frequency of the input states .",
    "the effectiveness of the scheme is , however , quite robust to random noise in the detection and copying .",
    "we note that although a detailed analysis was carried out for the case of single - photon detection , the basic scheme immediately generalizes to the case of distinguishing between any two mutually orthogonal states with inefficient detectors , and can be readily generalized to a larger set of input states , and different detectors .",
    "the analysis that is carried out in terms of mutual information between the sequence of input states , and an observer using the detection scheme , is seen to be a simple to use , and powerful method of evaluating detection schemes ."
