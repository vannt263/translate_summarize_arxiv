    "studies of static and dynamical properties of yukawa systems constitute an import interdisciplinary topic with applications to strongly coupled plasmas , dusty ( complex ) plasmas , and colloidal dispersions .",
    "an idealized model deals with point - like charged particles immersed in a neutralizing medium and interacting via the pairwise potential of yukawa ( debye - hckel ) type , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle charge , @xmath2 is the debye screening length associated with the neutralizing medium , and @xmath3 is the distance between a pair of particles . clearly , such an idealization oversimplifies considerably the actual rather complex interactions between the particles in real systems , in particular in dusty plasmas and colloidal suspensions  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , many experimentally observed trends can be reproduced by this simple consideration , at least qualitatively .",
    "hence , it can be considered as a basis for constructing more realistic models .",
    "thermodynamic properties of yukawa systems are relatively well investigated using various computational and analytical techniques .",
    "some relevant examples include monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) numerical simulations ,  @xcite as well as integral equation theoretical studies  @xcite . semi - empirical fitting formulas  @xcite and simplistic approaches  @xcite to estimate thermodynamics of yukawa systems have been also discussed in the literature .",
    "their accuracy is in most cases not better than moderate .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to put forward practical approach to evaluate thermodynamic properties of yukawa fluids across coupling regimes .",
    "this approach is based on simple phenomenological arguments , which are likely applicable to a wide class of soft repulsive interactions . in particular ,",
    "expressions for the internal energy , pressure , and isothermal compressibility modulus are derived . when compared with the `` exact '' results from numerical simulations",
    ", the approach demonstrates an impressive accuracy .",
    "hence , it represents very convenient tool to estimate thermodynamics of yukawa and other related fluids . among expected applications ,",
    "wave - related phenomena in strongly coupled complex ( dusty ) plasmas can be particularly mentioned .",
    "we consider @xmath4 particles contained in the ( three dimensional ) volume @xmath5 and interacting via the yukawa potential ( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "the number of particles and the volume are very large , while the number density @xmath6 is finite , so that finite - size and surface effects are not important .",
    "the system of repelling particles is stabilized by the presence of the neutralizing medium .",
    "the effect of this neutralizing medium on the thermodynamic properties of the system can be trivially evaluated , as discussed in the appendix  [ ap2 ] .",
    "we focus therefore on the contribution coming from particle - particle interactions and resulting correlations .",
    "thus we effectively consider a _ single component _ yukawa system .",
    "the system is characterized by two dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first is the coupling parameter , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wigner - seitz radius and @xmath9 is the temperature ( in energy units ) .",
    "this is roughly the ratio of the ( coulomb ) interaction energy between neighboring particles to the kinetic energy .",
    "the second is the screening parameter @xmath10 , which is roughly the ratio of the interparticle separation to the screening length .",
    "the main thermodynamic quantities considered here are the internal energy @xmath11 , helmholtz free energy @xmath12 , pressure @xmath13 , and the isothermal compressibility modulus @xmath14 .",
    "in reduced units these are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( the ratio @xmath18 is also known as the compressibility factor ) , respectively .",
    "except explicitly specified , we consider only the contribution from the particle - particle correlations .",
    "the reduced excess ( over that of non - interacting particles ) energy can be divided into the static and thermal components @xmath19 the static contribution corresponds to the value of internal energy when the particles are frozen in some regular structure and the thermal corrections arise due the deviations of the particles from these fixed position ( consequence of the thermal motion ) .",
    "of course , such a division is only meaningful when the regular structure is specified . for crystals ,",
    "the corresponding lattice sum is a relevant choice fort @xmath20 . for fluids",
    ", it is convenient to link @xmath20 with the energy obtained with the percus - yevick ( py ) radial distribution function of hard spheres in the unphysical limit @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the hard sphere packing fraction  @xcite . for yukawa system",
    "this is equivalent to the result of the ion sphere model ( ism ) , where each particle is placed in the center of the charge neutral wigner - seitz spherical cell and the energy is then calculated from simple electrostatic consideration  @xcite . with this choice ,",
    "the static component of the internal energy of the single component yukawa fluids becomes  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 has been termed the fluid madelung constant  @xcite .    .",
    "symbols correspond to the numerical simulations for different values of the screening parameter @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the ( red ) solid curve is the fit of eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the ( black ) dashed line corresponds to the same functional form , but with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as suggested in  @xcite.,width=283 ]    as rosenfeld and tarazona  @xcite first pointed out , the thermal component of the internal energy exhibits quasi - universal behavior for a wide class of soft repulsive potentials , including the yukawa case .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath31 is plotted for a number of screening parameters @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the value of the coupling parameter at the solid - fluid phase transition ( melting ) . to produce this plot , the numerical data on @xmath34 and @xmath35 tabulated in refs .",
    "@xcite have been used ( the contribution of the neutralizing medium has been subtracted ) .",
    "it is seen that numerical data have a tendency to group around a single quasi - universal curve .",
    "reasonably accurate fits ( shown by the curves ) can be obtained by using the following functional form @xmath36 the original suggestion of rosenfeld to use @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "some improvement can be observed when choosing @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as documented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "these values are therefore adopted throughout this paper .",
    "note that although the functional form ( [ fit ] ) with the exponent @xmath37 provides reasonable accuracy for yukawa fluids in a wide range of @xmath25 , it can be not the best choice for each single value of @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , in the case of one - component - plasma ( limiting case @xmath38 of yukawa systems ) , the exponent @xmath39 is known to deliver better accuracy  @xcite .    equations ( [ div])-([fit ] ) with the proper expression for @xmath35 ( see below ) provide a simple and accurate tool to estimate the excess energy of yukawa fluids .",
    "the excess free energy can then be obtained by the standard integration @xmath40 note that in case of the non - zero value of the parameter @xmath41 , this integral is diverging logarithmically .",
    "a simple conventional procedure to avoid this divergence is to start integration from @xmath42 in ( [ free ] ) and add the corresponding value @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the weakly coupled region @xmath43 is in fact of minor importance for @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath43 have been tabulated in refs .",
    "@xcite , interpolation is straightforward .",
    "this is not done here , because the main interest is the excess pressure and its derivative at strong coupling , where the contribution from the weak coupling region is negligible .    using the dimensionless quantities @xmath25 and @xmath45 instead of particle density and temperature",
    ", the excess pressure can be obtained from  @xcite @xmath46 after the straightforward manipulation we can rewrite this as @xmath47 where @xmath48 $ ] is the excess pressure associated with the static component of the internal energy and the two last terms in ( [ pex ] ) come from the thermal component of the internal energy .",
    "the static contribution can be easily evaluated and yields a compact expression  @xcite @xmath49 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] to evaluate the thermal contribution , the functional dependence @xmath35 should be specified .",
    "several approximate methods to locate the fluid - solid phase transition , based on the properties of the interaction potential alone , have been discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "some of them are applicable to a wide range of interactions , including the yukawa case , and can be used for this purpose .",
    "being focused on yukawa interaction here , we adopt a simple expression proposed by vaulina _",
    "et al_.  @xcite @xmath50 where the constant @xmath51 is the ratio of the mean interparticle distance @xmath52 to the wigner - seitz radius @xmath53 .",
    "equation ( [ melt ] ) is in rather good agreement with the numerical data in the regime @xmath54 addressed in this study .",
    "equations ( [ fit ] ) , ( [ pex ] ) , ( [ pst ] ) , and ( [ melt ] ) allow to evaluate the excess pressure and hence the compressibility factor , @xmath55 of yukawa fluids for any given pair @xmath25 and @xmath45 .",
    "this constitutes the main result of this paper . in the appendix  [ ap1 ]",
    "the explicit expressions for the compressibility factor and isothermal compressibility modulus are provided , which are convenient for practical calculations .",
    ".[tab0 ] compressibility factor ( reduced pressure ) of a single component yukawa fluid in a wide range of coupling .",
    "the first two columns specify the location of the system state point on the @xmath56 plane .",
    "the third column lists the values of the reduced coupling strength @xmath31 ( note that the first point may correspond to supercooled liquid ) .",
    "the remaining columns contain the values of @xmath57 obtained using mc simulations by meijer and frenkel ( mf )  @xcite ( @xmath58 ) , dry method by tejero _",

    "simple approach to estimate the internal energy , pressure , and compressibility modulus of three - dimensional yukawa fluids across coupling regimes has been put forward .",
    "explicit analytical expressions for these quantities have been derived ( see appendix  [ ap1 ] ) , which demonstrate excellent agreement with precise results from mc simulations at strong coupling . these expressions are directly applicable to single component yukawa systems , modifications to describe charged particles in the neutralizing medium are trivial ( see appendix  [ ap2 ] ) .",
    "the obtained results can be particularly useful in connection with studying wave phenomena in strongly coupled complex ( dusty ) plasmas , since simple and accurate equation of state is often required for such studies . for this reason , the main focus here has been on pressure - related quantities , although other thermodynamic functions can apparently be also estimated using the proposed approach .",
    "the approach is also likely to be relevant for other simple fluids with soft repulsive interactions , when the static component of the internal energy dominates over the thermal one .",
    "this and related issues are left for future work .",
    "we would like to thank panagiotis tolias for useful discussions .",

    "to keep some generality we consider the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 , entering eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) for the thermal component of the excess energy , as unspecified for a moment .",
    "the explicit expression for the compressibility factor is @xmath64 ^ 2}+\\frac{\\delta}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma_{\\rm m}}\\right)^{2/5}f_{\\rm z}(\\alpha\\kappa),\\ ] ] where @xmath65 the isothermal compressibility modulus is related to the compressibility factor via @xmath66 .",
    "this yields @xmath67 ^ 3}+\\frac{\\delta}{45}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma_{\\rm m}}\\right)^{2/5}f_{\\rm \\mu}(\\alpha\\kappa),\\ ] ] where @xmath68 the dependence @xmath35 is given by eq .",
    "( [ melt ] ) . regarding the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", we suggest to use @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the contributions from particle - particle correlations and particle - background interactions are additive . in particular , the excess energy associated with the presence of neutralizing medium is  @xcite @xmath69 the first term represents the excess ( free ) energy of the medium that , on average , neutralizes the charge of the particles while the second term gives the ( free ) energy of the sheath around each particle . note that this latter term does not contribute to the excess pressure , as can be clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "it , therefore , has no effect on the compressibility modulus , too . to account for the effect of the neutralizing medium , one simply needs to add the term @xmath70 to the compressibility factor , eq .",
    "( [ expl_p ] ) , and the term @xmath71 to the isothermal compressibility modulus , eq .",
    "( [ expl_mu ] ) .",
    "note that the contribution of the neutralizing medium is _ negative _ and _ dominant _ at strong coupling , implying that the excess energy , pressure , and compressibility are also negative in this regime .",
