    "an accurate estimate of the intrinsic collision probability between two objects moving on independent keplerian orbits is essential in many topics in planetary system studies : the impact flux of interplanetary dust particles and minor planets on the earth and other planets @xcite , evolution of the orbits of a swarm of planetesimals @xcite , planet formation @xcite , dynamical lifetimes of small bodies @xcite , collisional evolution of asteroids @xcite , the impact hazard of near - earth asteroids @xcite , and collisions amongst artificial earth - orbiting satellites @xcite .    in such problems ,",
    "one usually wishes to quantify the probability of collision within some volume of space which is small compared to the uncertainties of the orbital parameters of the objects that pass through that volume ; the objects are assumed to be moving on independent keplerian orbits about a central body . @xcite",
    "derived an equation for this collision probability for the case when one of the objects is assumed to be in a circular orbit .",
    "@xcite generalized this solution to two eccentric orbits .",
    "pik s and wetherill s approaches have two steps in the calculation of collision probability .",
    "first , the collision probability for two intersecting keplerian orbits is calculated .",
    "we call this probability @xmath0 , which is a function of the collision radius and the orbital elements defining the shape and the orientation of the two orbits .",
    "the two orbits are assumed to be fixed in space , and the mean anomalies are assumed to be independent ( i.e. , there is no mean motion resonance between the two bodies ) .",
    "then , over a long period of time , the pair of objects has a well - defined probability of impact near the location where the two orbits intersect or where the distance between the two orbits is small enough for collision to be possible .",
    "( the collision radius is inflated from the sum of the physical radii of the bodies , to account for the gravitational focusing effect from their mutual interaction . ) secondly , for ensembles of bodies , the equation for @xmath0 works as a back - bone to calculate the average collision probability marginalized over all values of the mutual argument of pericenter , @xmath1 . for most values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the minimum distance between two orbits is much larger than the distance that allows collision .",
    "thus , the specific ranges of @xmath1 that allow the collision condition is calculated and @xmath0 over those intervals is integrated over the entire range .    in most previous works in the context of collision rates of asteroids , it has been assumed that apsidal and nodal precession rates are uniform so that @xmath1 is uniformly distributed over its range @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in two recent studies @xcite , the assumption of uniform precession is discarded and the secular evolution along the kozai - lidov cycle is adopted to integrate @xmath0 for high inclination orbits .",
    "@xcite showed that a monte - carlo method can be used to integrate @xmath0 over the precession cycle .",
    "although all the cases described in @xcite have uniformly distributed angular parameters , their method can be straightforwardly extended to applications with non - uniformly distributed angular parameters .",
    "@xcite implemented the pik - wetherill method for the case of non - uniform precession by generating a large number of clones which follow the non - uniform angular distributions .",
    "the @xmath0 values of clones are then summed up to yield the total collision probability on a target object without assuming uniform precession or uniform distribution of @xmath1 .",
    "this method was used to calculate the seasonal variation of the asteroid impact flux on mars @xcite .",
    "we stress that collision probability , @xmath0 , should be interpreted only from the statistical standpoint of collisions of a large population of small bodies in nearly keplerian orbits .",
    "it is not appropriate for predicting a specific impact event in the near future , nor for estimating the long - time impact probability , for a specific pair of objects . for the former purpose , we need the information of passage time which is regarded as a random value in the calculation of @xmath0 . for the latter purpose , the premise of fixed keplerian orbits is invalid as orbits evolve over time . with the steady state condition for the orbital distribution of numerous colliders ,",
    "however , we can statistically calculate the impact probability for a given object by integrating @xmath0 over the distribution of colliders .    in the present work , we first present , in section  [ s : nontngcol ] , a new and simplified derivation of @xcite s collision probability , @xmath0 .",
    "we then show that @xmath0 diverges when the two objects are moving in the same direction , i.e. , when the two bodies have a tangential encounter .",
    "several authors @xcite have pointed out this singularity in @xcite and @xcite s approach , but addressed it only in the averaging of @xmath0 over the precession cycle .",
    "@xcite discussed outcomes of tangential encounters but did not calculate the modification of @xmath0 in such cases .",
    "thus , the singularity problem in @xmath0 itself has not been solved .",
    "even though near - tangential encounters are not very common , the singularly high collision probability of even just a few such cases can cause non - negligible errors in estimates of collision rates .",
    "we examine this singularity problem carefully , and we derive an improved equation for @xmath0 for tangential encounters which regularizes this singularity ( section  [ s : tangenc ] ) .",
    "we comment on the practical implementation of the formulas for tangential and non - tangential encounters in a general purpose code for collision rates ( section  [ s : transition ] ) , and we describe a case study to illustrate the importance of the correct treatment of tangential encounters ( section  [ s : casestudy ] ) .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section  [ s : summary ] .",
    "consider the motion of two bodies , body 1 and body 2 , whose fixed keplerian orbits are intersecting each other .",
    "their motions are approximated to be linear near the orbit intersection where collision is possible , as illustrated in figure  [ lntrj ] .",
    "each body s position can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary position vector along the line at time @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the constant velocity in the neighborhood of the orbit intersection point .",
    "we can set up a position relation between the two bodies using the point of intersection : @xmath7 where subscripts denote the object number ( figure  [ lntrj ] ) . in this configuration",
    "each body passes the orbit intersection point at time @xmath8 and time @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the encounter velocity is @xmath10 by taking the cross product with the encounter velocity on both sides of equation  [ rtv ] and re - arranging the terms , we get @xmath11 any pair of bodies moving with non - parallel constant velocities has a unique time when the distance between the two bodies , @xmath12 , becomes minimum . by calling this specific time @xmath5 , we get the minimum distance @xmath13 .    at the minimum distance ,",
    "the encounter velocity vector is normal to the relative position vector .",
    "this is a trivial consequence of the fact that at the minimum mutual distance , @xmath14 and the left hand side is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "as this concept is a core part in further derivations , we write it down as a mathematical theorem below for frequent reference .",
    "[ t : normal ] two moving points have their local minimum distance when their relative position vector is normal to their encounter velocity vector .",
    "this is true for any two moving points on regular curves , except when the relative distance of the two moving points vanishes and the direction of their relative position becomes meaningless .",
    "we mention that theorem  [ t : normal ] encapsulates the same concept as in the definition of the so - called  @xmath16-plane \" adopted by @xcite in the context of pik - wetherill formulas .",
    "the @xmath16-plane is defined as the plane passing through the target body and being normal to the inbound asymptotic ( unperturbed ) relative velocity .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath16 , which is the magnitude of the projection of the inbound asymptote on the @xmath16-plane , is related to the minimum encounter distance by a scaling factor that accounts for the gravitational interaction between the two bodies .",
    "in fact , the gravitational interaction between the bodies makes the two bodies approach closer than the distance @xmath16 ( this is the so - called  gravitational focusing \" effect ) ; we will include this effect when we discuss the collision radius later .",
    "we note that gravitational focusing also causes a change in the relative velocity of the two bodies , but this is usually insignificant and is neglected in the calculation of @xmath0 in the pik - wetherill approach . throughout this paper , we use  encounter velocity \" to refer to the relative velocity which is unperturbed by the mutual gravitational interaction of body 1 and body 2 .    from theorem  [ t : normal ] and equation  [ rxvrel ]",
    ", we can find that the time interval between body 1 and body 2 passing the orbit intersection point , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scalar magnitude of @xmath20 .    .",
    "the two bodies have minimum distance , @xmath21 , at @xmath5.,width=300 ]    for convenience we choose body 1 as the body passing the intersection point ahead of the other body ( @xmath22 ) , and illustrate this in figure  [ bullett ] .",
    "note that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 can have negative values as one or both bodies may have already passed the orbit intersection point when the two bodies approach each other with the minimum distance , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath5 . in the middle panel of figure  [ bullett ] , body 2",
    "is @xmath23 ahead of the orbit intersection point when body 1 is passing the intersection ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "if body 2 were farther away from the intersection at @xmath24 , the pair would have larger minimum distance than @xmath21 .",
    "likewise , if body 2 were located near the orbit intersection point at @xmath24 , the minimum distance would be smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "collision is possible if @xmath21 is smaller than a specified collision radius @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the collision radius @xmath25 would be the sum of the physical radii of the two bodies , if we neglect their mutual gravity . if we wish to take account of their mutual gravity , we can multiply with the gravitational focusing factor .    thus , if body 2 passes the orbit intersection point later than body 1 , collision would occur if and only if , at time @xmath24 , body 2 is within @xmath27 of reaching the intersection point .",
    "conversely , if body 2 passes the orbit intersection point ahead of body 1 , collision would occur if and only if body 2 already has passed within the time interval @xmath27 before body 1 passes the intersection point .",
    "therefore , whenever body 1 passes the intersection point , collision would occur if body 2 is within the time interval @xmath29 of reaching the intersection point .",
    "considering that body 1 passes the intersection point once per its orbital revolution , the probability @xmath30 that it collides with body 2 in any single orbital period is @xmath31 thus the collision probability per unit time , @xmath0 , for body 1 to collide with body 2 is @xmath30 divided by the orbital period of body 1 , @xmath32 note that @xmath0 is the collision probability per unit time when two orbits exactly intersect .",
    "the general case of non - intersecting orbits will be considered in the next section .    , is along the z axis .",
    "the y direction is chosen to be parallel to the direction of motion of body 2 .",
    "the xy plane is the plane of the orbit of body 1 ; the trajectory of body 2 is a distance @xmath33 away from the xy plane .",
    "when two bodies reaches the minimum distance @xmath21 , their projected relatiisve distance on the xy plane becomes @xmath34.,width=300 ]      even when two orbits do not intersect , collision is still possible if the distance between the closest points of the two orbits , so - called `` minimum orbit intersection distance '' or moid , is less than the collision radius @xmath25 .",
    "we note that , in general there exist multiple local minima of the distance between two orbits @xcite , and it is possible that more than one of these could be less than @xmath25 .",
    "the collision probabilities introduced by those local minima can be easily integrated , if necessary , as they have the same functional form as that of the moid . in the case",
    "study that we describe in section  [ s : casestudy ] , we include contributions by all the multiple local minima .    the calculation of @xmath0 for the non - intersecting case and its averaging for moid@xmath35 is described well in @xcite . here",
    "we derive the same equation with an alternative approach .",
    "first we note that two skewed lines , _ i.e. _ a pair of lines not intersecting nor being parallel , have a unique minimum distance and the vector along the minimum distance is normal to both the lines .",
    "this can be generalized as the following theorem .",
    "[ t : skewd ] two smooth curves have the local minimum distance along the line orthogonal to the tangents of both curves .    stated in other words , the normal planes of two smooth curves at a certain point on each curve should coincide with each other if there exists a local minimum distance at the given points .",
    "then , as before , we linearize the motion of the two bodies in the neighborhood of the moid .",
    "figure  [ dgrmln ] illustrates the situation when the minimum non - zero distance between two orbits , denoted by @xmath36 , is along the z axis . by theorem  [ t : skewd ] , both bodies move normal to the z axis in the vicinity of the moid location . without loss of generality , we choose the y axis to be parallel to the motion of body 2 .",
    "the path of body 2 , shifted by @xmath37 , intersects the path of body 1 at the origin , as in section  [ s : drvintsec ] .",
    "therefore , from equation  [ rtv ] and  [ rxvrel ] , @xmath38 @xmath39 as before , we consider body 1 and body 2 to have a minimum distance @xmath21 at @xmath40 and @xmath41 at @xmath5 . in equation",
    "[ rxvrel2 ] , the resultant direction of the right - hand side is parallel to the z axis . as @xmath20 is on the xy plane , @xmath42 should also lie on the xy plane and its magnitude is @xmath43 from pythagorean theorem ( figure  [ dgrmln ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath20 is normal to both @xmath36 and @xmath44 ; the latter is normal to @xmath20 according to theorem  [ t : normal ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 is also normal to @xmath20 , which gives @xmath45 for collision radius @xmath25 .    for two fixed orbits having @xmath46",
    ", we can use equation  [ dt2 ] without any modification .",
    "however , in monte - carlo type numerical simulations , the averaged value of @xmath0 , within @xmath46 , is more useful as we can get a better estimate of impact flux from the same number of test projectiles .    in the small vicinity where collisions are allowed , @xmath33 can be assumed to be uniformly distributed .",
    "( this follows from the argument that , for a random distribution of lines with fixed directions in space , the fraction of cases with minimum distance less than @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath33 ; this is a good assumption for @xmath47 heliocentric distance . )",
    "averaging @xmath27 within @xmath46 , equation  [ dt2 ] gives @xmath48 times @xmath27 of equation  [ dtcol ] .",
    "therefore , the averaged collision probability per unit time when two bodies have @xmath33 random in the range @xmath49 becomes @xmath50      in @xcite s derivation , his equation 7 gives the probability of collision per unit time for two bodies on intersecting orbits .",
    "expressing his equation with our notation gives @xmath51 where @xmath52 in above equation @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the x and y components of @xmath20 and @xmath55 is the angle between the x axis and the velocity vector of body 1 .",
    "the sun is located in the x direction .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath56 is the maximum distance from the orbit intersection point where body 1 should be present to allow collision to occur when body 2 is at the orbit intersection point .",
    "derivation of equation  [ wethpx ] and [ etamax ] is lengthy and complicated in @xcite and his equation does not look commutative between body 1 and body 2 at first glance . below we prove that his equation is the same as our simplified derivation of the collision probability per unit time , equation  [ ptau ] , which is clearly symmetric in body 1 and body 2 .",
    "the term , @xmath57 , in the denominator of equation  [ etamax ] is the projection of the * encounter * velocity @xmath20 along the velocity direction of body 1 .",
    "therefore , the denominator is equal to the component of @xmath20 normal to @xmath58 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 which gives equation  [ ptau ] when it is substituted to equation  [ wethpx ] .",
    "when the bodies are located at point a and b , respectively .",
    "point b@xmath60 is the location of body 2 having the same y component as point a. the angle between the common direction of two bodies ( staight line ) and + x direction is @xmath61 .",
    "the curvatures of two bodies are exaggerated for visual clarification.,width=300 ]    it is evident that the right hand side of equation  [ ptau ] is singular when @xmath58 and @xmath62 are parallel .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure  [ dgrmtng ] .",
    "the origin of this singularity lies in our linear approximation for the motion of bodies near the collision point . to resolve this singularity",
    ", we can use a better approximation of the true motion of the two bodies , namely parabolic motion instead of linear motion , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the gravitational acceleration due to the sun , assumed to be constant in the vicinity of the encounter .",
    "the constant vector @xmath65 is the velocity of body @xmath66 at the orbit intersection point , and body @xmath66 passes the orbit intersection point at time @xmath67 . at this time , the direction of the velocity vector of both bodies is the same .",
    "the encounter geometry is illustrated in figure  [ dgrmtng ] in a coordinate system with the origin at the orbit intersection point , the sun is located on the negative x axis , the orbital poles of the two bodies are aligned to the z direction , and the motion of the two bodies is approximated as parabolic paths .",
    "( note that the time epochs , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , when body 1 and body 2 pass the origin , have negative values in the case illustrated in figure  [ dgrmtng ] . )",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the angle between the x - axis and the common direction of the velocity vectors ; the range of @xmath61 is @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "the time @xmath5 is defined as the epoch when the two bodies approach the minimum distance , @xmath21 ; at this time their position vectors are @xmath70 and @xmath71 and the encounter velocity is given by the relative velocity at @xmath5 , @xmath72    we define the outer orbit , the one having smaller curvature , as body 1 and the inner orbit as body 2 . because the outer body should have higher velocity than the inner body at @xmath5",
    ", we introduce a velocity ratio @xmath73 where the negative values occur when body 2 orbits in the opposite direction of body 1 . for simplicity , in the following",
    "we consider only the case of positive @xmath74 for the derivation of @xmath0 .",
    "the derivation for the negative @xmath74 is similar , and we note that the final results ( equation  [ tcoltng ] , [ ptng0 ] , [ dttng2 ] , and [ ptng ] ) hold true for both positive and negative @xmath74 . the general derivation with an alternative approach is also provided in the appendix .    the path of body 2 from the origin to point b is slightly longer than the path of body 1 from the origin to point a in the case illustrated in figure  [ dgrmtng ] . because the y components of the velocities remain constant , the ratio of the travel time for @xmath75 for body 2 and @xmath76 for body 1 is equal to the inverse of the ratio of initial velocity , @xmath77 .",
    "( here @xmath78 is the location of body 2 having the same y component as the point a. ) the relation between the times @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( when body 1 and body 2 pass the origin ) can be written as @xmath79 where the small time interval , @xmath80 , for body 2 to go from @xmath81 to @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 note that @xmath80 is positive when @xmath84 and negative for @xmath85 . to solve for @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", we take a similar approach as in section  [ s : nontngcol ] . thus ,",
    "similar to equation  [ rtv ] , we can set up the following relation for the positions of the two bodies using the orbit intersection point : @xmath86 by taking the vector product with the encounter velocity , @xmath87 ( eq .  [ u0 ] ) , on both sides of equation  [ rtv3 ] , and using @xmath88 ( for tangential encounters ) , we get @xmath89 where @xmath90 . with the use of theorem  [ t : normal ] , the above equation simplifies to the following , @xmath91 g \\sin{\\alpha } , \\label{rxvrel3_2}\\ ] ] because @xmath80 is a small value , we neglect the term with @xmath80 for the moment ( but we return to it below ) .",
    "also , considering that @xmath92 is much smaller than @xmath93 , @xmath20 can be approximated as @xmath94 .",
    "then , we find the minimum distance of approach of the two bodies is related to their times of passage at the origin as follows , @xmath95 by using @xmath96 and rearranging equation  [ dmin ] , we obtain @xmath97 where the minus sign is for the case when the bodies have already passed the origin when the minimum distance is achieved ( as in figure  [ dgrmtng ] ) , whereas the plus sign is for the opposite case .",
    "analogous to the derivation in section  [ s : nontngcol ] , we can define the time interval @xmath98 for collision to occur for a given collision radius @xmath25 : @xmath99 thus , if body 2 has passed the origin more than @xmath27 earlier than body 1 , body 1 can not catch up to collide with body 2 . on the other hand , unlike figure  [ dgrmtng ] , in order for the collision to occur before the bodies reach the orbit intersection point , the expected @xmath8 should not be more than @xmath27 earlier than the expected @xmath9 .    if we wish to be more accurate , equations  [ t2t1delt ] and [ dmin ] give the following better estimate of @xmath27 , @xmath100 where the sign order is the same as in equation  [ t2 ] .    in other words ,",
    "regardless of the choice between the above two equations , if body 2 passes the origin within a time interval @xmath101 of when body 1 passes the origin , the collision would occur .",
    "( note that the @xmath80 term in equation  [ tcoltng2 ] cancels when we add the time intervals with the plus and minus signs . )",
    "thus , the collision probability per unit time of these two bodies whose velocity vectors are parallel near the collision point is given by    .",
    "the sun is located along the minus horizontal direction ( -x ) and the path of body 1 ( oa ) defines the xy plane .",
    "the projection of body 2 on the xy plane is also shown ( ob ) .",
    "minimum orbit intersection occurs when body 1 is at the origin ( oc ) .",
    "the minimum distance with time between two orbit @xmath21 is projected on xy plane and shown as line ab . the moving direction of two bodies at a and b are almost same as their direction at the origin ( two straight lines ) . however , we exaggerated curvatures of two bodies for visual clarification.,width=300 ]    @xmath102    this equation may appear counter - intuitive at first glance because @xmath0 decreases as the velocity ratio @xmath74 approaches 1 .",
    "it is true that the path length oa and ob increases as @xmath74 approaches 1 .",
    "however , as the two velocities become identical , it takes longer for body 1 to catch up with body 2 .",
    "consequently , when body 1 is at the origin , body 2 should be located within a smaller distance to have a chance to collide with body 1 .",
    "now we consider a more general collision geometry where the orbits do not intersect but their minimum approach distance , @xmath33 , is small enough to allow collision .",
    "we define a coordinate system that has the origin as the point on body 1 s orbit where the moid , @xmath46 , occurs . again , the sun is located along the x direction and the orbit of body 1 is on the xy plane .",
    "we assume that the variation of the vertical velocity component of body 2 is negligible in the small region where collisions are possible .    according to theorem  [ t : skewd ] , at the location where moid occurs",
    ", the position vector of body 2 should be normal to the velocity direction of both bodies , @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the position of body 2 at @xmath104 can be expressed as follows : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the angle between the position vector of body 2 and the xy plane .",
    "figure  [ dgrmtng2 ] shows the orbit of body 1 on the xy plane with the projection of the orbit of body 2 on the xy plane . as before ,",
    "when body 1 passes the point a , it can barely touch body 2 located at b. because the path of body 2 shifted by @xmath107 intersects the path of body 1 at the origin , from equations  [ rtv3 ] and [ rxvrel3 ] , we get @xmath108 @xmath109 as in section  [ s : drvintsec2 ] , we approximate @xmath110 and @xmath111 . as @xmath112 ( theorem  [ t : normal ] ) and @xmath113 ( theorem  [ t : skewd ] ) ,",
    "@xmath114 is also close to orthogonal to @xmath94 and @xmath20 , therefore we get @xmath115 the z - directional motion of body 2 is negligible in the small vicinity of the moid location , so body 2 is moving in the plane parallel to the orbital plane of body 1 .",
    "thus , as illustrated in figure  [ dgmsbta ] , @xmath114 lies in the xy plane and has length    , minimum distance of two moving bodies @xmath21 , and the angles @xmath106 and @xmath116 measured from the xy plane.,width=300 ]    @xmath117    where @xmath116 is the angle between the line corresponding to the moid and the xy plane . by the law of sines , the angle @xmath116 is given by @xmath118 as is the case in section  [ s : drvintsec2 ] , @xmath9 is not exactly the same as @xmath119 , but the difference almost cancels with the time difference on the opposite side , _ i.e. _ the case where the minimum distance is achieved before the bodies reach the origin .",
    "thus , from equation  [ dmin2 ] through  [ dgmeqsbta ] , we obtain , for collision radius of @xmath25 , the time interval @xmath27 to be @xmath120 assuming a uniform distribution within the parameter space @xmath121 and @xmath122 , we can obtain the average value of @xmath27 .",
    "( care must be taken over the range of @xmath106 , as the orbit of the faster body should always be outside of the slower body in the vicinity of the moid . ) with numerical integration we found the average value of the factor @xmath123 is 0.61 .",
    "thus , we obtain the collision probability per unit time ,    @xmath124    in the appendix , we present fully analytic derivations which prove that equation  [ tcoltng2 ] and [ dttng2 ] are valid for @xmath125 .",
    "this condition is well satisfied in solar system applications of the impact rate of asteroids on planets , since planet sizes are much smaller than their heliocentric distances .",
    "an example where this condition may be violated is for large planets orbiting close to their host star .",
    "for example , in the case of hot jupiter wasp-18b orbiting with semimajor axis of 0.02  au , the physical radius is 2.7% of the semimajor axis @xcite . considering the gravitational focusing factor",
    ", we calculate @xmath126 of wasp-18b to be equal to @xmath127 when @xmath128 . for the more common planetary targets with larger semimajor axis and smaller radius than wasp-18b , equation  [ tcoltng2 ] and [ dttng2 ] are valid approximations unless the encounter velocity is vanishingly small .",
    "we have seen that the collision probability for non - tangential encounters , equation  [ pmoid0 ] and [ ptau ] , increases to infinity as the velocity vectors become aligned , which is not physical . on the other hand , our formulas for the collision probability for the tangential case ,",
    "equation  [ ptng0 ] and [ ptng ] , are independent of the angle , @xmath129 , between the two velocity vectors .",
    "this is also not a good approximation when @xmath130 is not too small .",
    "we expect that the collision probability smoothly transitions from the non - tangential formula to the tangential case as @xmath130 decreases below some transition angle , @xmath131 . however , a rigorous calculation of this transition is hard to obtain , for two reasons .",
    "first , the collision time interval @xmath27 ( equation  [ dt2 ] and [ dttng2 ] ) is a function of @xmath33 and @xmath106 , therefore , the transition will be a function of both parameters . furthermore , for tangential collisions , the body with higher velocity should orbit outside of the body of slower velocity near the moid location , whereas this restriction is removed for the non - tangential case .    here , we provide an approximate condition for the transition between the non - tangential and tangential collisions by equating equation  [ ptau ] and [ ptng ] . when the velocity vectors are nearly parallel , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "then , with the approximation @xmath134 , we obtain the transition value @xmath131 , @xmath135 it is useful to comment on some properties of @xmath131 .    1 .",
    "the @xmath136 term in the numerator can be expressed as a function of true anomaly @xmath137 and eccentricity @xmath138 of an elliptical orbit , @xmath139 the minimum value of @xmath136 is @xmath140 , and it occurs when @xmath141 . for nearly circular orbits , @xmath136 is close to unity . for an eccentric orbit of @xmath142 ,",
    "the minimum @xmath136 is 0.866 when @xmath143 , and @xmath144 can be as small as 0.5 only when the eccentricity is as large as 0.866",
    "the factor @xmath145 is monotonically decreasing to zero as @xmath74 approaches unity .",
    "this means that @xmath131 is smaller for smaller encounter velocities .",
    "the transition angle , @xmath131 , is proportional to the square root of the collision radius divided by the heliocentric distance , @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the transition angle would be significantly larger for close - in large planets , such as hot jupiters in exo - planetary systems .",
    "as an example , consider the case of the earth with a circular orbit and an impactor with velocity ratio of @xmath147 .",
    "we adopt the physical radius of the earth for @xmath25 ( neglecting gravitational focusing ) .",
    "figure  [ colpcomp ] shows the collision probability @xmath0 for this example , calculated with equations  [ ptau ] and [ ptng ] ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "( we plot the product of @xmath0 and the orbital period of the impactor to provide the dimensionless result , collision probability per orbital revolution of earth . ) for this case , we find @xmath148 .     near the moid location .",
    "earth s orbit is assumed to be circular and gravitational focusing is neglected .",
    "the ordinate is the collision probability per orbital revolution of earth .",
    "the previous method of calculation has an unphysical singularity near @xmath149 ( solid line , equation  [ ptau ] ) ; our new method for calculation of collision probability of a tangential encounter gives a finite result which is independent of the encounter angle ( dashed line , equation  [ ptng ] ) . , width=300 ]    in practical monte - carlo type numerical simulations with a moderate number of particles , the number of cases of moid @xmath150 is often statistically too small to accurately calculate the integrated impact flux of a projectile population on a given target . for computational efficiency ,",
    "an artificially enhanced collision radius , @xmath151 with @xmath152 , can be adopted and the results scaled to the real collision radius ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for the case of non - tangential encounters , the number of random orbits having moid @xmath150 on the target orbit increases linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "as the collision probability itself also linearly increases with @xmath25 ( equation  [ ptau ] ) , the total impact flux is proportional to @xmath153 .",
    "thus , the numerically computed impact flux with an adopted collision radius @xmath151 can be rescaled by a factor @xmath154 to obtain the real impact flux .",
    "on the other hand , for the case of tangential encounters , the number of cases of moid @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath153 . in practice , however , the exactly tangential cases are of measure zero , so two velocity vectors will not be strictly parallel near the moid location , and there would be a small , non - zero angle between them .",
    "we can identify the near - tangential cases , i.e. , those with @xmath155 , and in these cases the minimum encounter distance should be measured along the @xmath156 direction .",
    "the number of such cases having moid @xmath150 is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "as the collision probability in these encounters is proportional to @xmath157 ( equation  [ dttng2 ] ) , the integrated impact flux of these cases is proportional to @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , in monte - carlo type numerical simulations , care should be taken with the artificially enhanced collision radius : the transition angle @xmath131 should be calculated with the physical radius @xmath25 ( including a gravitational focusing factor ) , not the artificially enhanced collision radius ; and the impact flux of the near - tangential collisions should be rescaled by a factor @xmath159 .",
    "in this section , we provide a case study of the impact flux of a synthetic population of neos on earth to illustrate that the correct treatment of tangential encounters is crucial to determine the correct impact frequency .",
    "the orbital parameters , the mass and the physical radius of earth are adopted and the impact frequency from @xmath160 test particles orbiting in earth - like orbits is calculated .",
    "the test particles semimajor axes are chosen randomly from the range 1.11.2  au ; this range exceeds ten times the hill radius of earth , and avoids the co - orbital region of earth .",
    "the eccentricities are chosen randomly from zero to 0.3 , and inclinations from zero to 5 degrees relative to the ecliptic ; these ranges are selected for more frequent near - tangential encounters .",
    "the arguments of perihelia and the longitudes of ascending node are randomly generated within the range zero to @xmath161 .",
    "for statistical analysis , we repeat the same simulation 100 times ( making different realizations of the random orbital parameters in each case ) , and we report mean values and standard deviations of the impact counts below .    using the code developed by @xcite , we determine that the total number of orbit crossings having local minimum distances smaller than the collision radius is @xmath162 . for the collision radius , we multiply the physical radius of earth by the gravitational focusing factor of each test particle . for this synthetic population of impactors with",
    "earth - like orbits , the mean of the gravitational focusing factor is a significantly large value of 2.96 .",
    "test particles representing neos . the gray shaded histogram ( with wide bins )",
    "depicts the results from the unmodified pik - wetherill formulas using equation  [ ptau ] .",
    "the black histogram ( with narrow bins ) depicts the results from our improved method in which equation  [ ptau ] is replaced by equation  [ ptng ] for the near - tangential encounters .",
    "the impact rates from 100 independent realizations of random test particle neos are used for these histograms . note that a logarithmic scale is used on the abscissa.,width=400 ]",
    "the total impact frequency calculated from equation  [ ptau ] varies greatly from simulation to simulation , from a minimum of 1.6 impacts per year to the maximum of 456 impacts per year ; the results are shown in the gray shaded histogram in figure  [ impfrqlog ] .",
    "the mean value and the standard deviation are 9.8 and 47 , respectively .",
    "this highly variable impact frequency is owed to the divergence of equation  [ ptau ] when test particles sporadically encounter earth at nearly tangential velocities with @xmath163 .",
    "a careful examination of the distribution of the close encounters reveals that , among the @xmath162 local minimum distances smaller than the collision radius , only @xmath164 of them have smaller @xmath130 than the critical value ( equation  [ thetacrit2 ] ) , but the smallest @xmath130 case alone contributes more than 50 percent of the total impact frequency in 18 simulations out of 100 .",
    "however , the corrected total impact frequency , when equation  [ ptau ] is replaced by equation  [ ptng ] for the near - tangential encounters , is found to be a very stable quantity , @xmath165 impacts per year ( shown in the narrow black histogram on the left of figure  [ impfrqlog ] ) .",
    "these results show that the incorrect treatment of near - tangential encounters leads to systematically higher impact rate estimates and also greater scatter of the estimates .    in order to demonstrate the validity of our formulas for the impact probability in near - tangential encounters ( equation  [ ptng ] )",
    ", we sampled 1000 test particle orbits having @xmath166 , from amongst the above - described synthetic populations of neos .",
    "we numerically integrated these particles with swift - rmvs3 ( http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/swift.html ) , in a model including the sun and the earth with their actual mass and radius .",
    "the mean anomalies of the test particles were randomly generated in 10 different realizations , and 10 different numerical simulations are carried out for statistical analysis .",
    "we limited the orbit integration time to 10 years to avoid orbit evolution of the particles , and we adopted an integration step size of 1.4 minutes to accurately resolve collisions . from the 10 different numerical integrations , we find an average of @xmath167 impacts .",
    "we can compare this result of the numerical integrations with the expected number of impacts calculated with the unmodified pik - wetherill formulas and with our corrected formulas . for the former ,",
    "the expected value calculated from equation  [ ptau ] is 1802 impacts over ten years ; this large value , which is unsurprising due to the nature of the singularity in equation  [ ptau ] for near - tangential encounters , is strongly in disagreement with the numerical integration result . for the latter ,",
    "the expected value calculated from equation  [ ptng ] is 8 impacts over ten years , which is within 1@xmath168 of the numerical integration result .",
    "the classical method of @xcite and @xcite for calculating collision probabilities of pairs of objects in keplerian orbits has been widely used in many problems in planetary dynamics . in this paper , we have given a simplified derivation of the backbone of these calculations .",
    "our derivation is easier to understand and to relate to the underlying geometry of collisions of keplerian orbits .",
    "additionally , our formula for the collision probability per unit time , @xmath0 ( equation  [ ptau ] ) , is explicitly commutative between the two colliding orbits ( in contrast with the pik - wetherill formulas ) .",
    "we also derived the collision probability for tangential encounters ( equation  [ ptng ] ) ; this regularizes a singularity in the pik - wetherill formulas .",
    "we achieve this regularization by replacing the linear approximation in the vicinity of the collision point with a parabolic approximation of the true motions of the bodies , but otherwise the derivation is similar to the derivation for the non - tangential encounters . in the appendix , we provide an alternate , fully analytic derivation , which additionally identifies the domain of applicability of the regularized collision probability of tangential collisions",
    ". stated qualitatively , our formulas are valid in the regime in which the collision radius is much smaller than the heliocentric distance and the encounter velocity is not a vanishingly small fraction of the orbital velocity .",
    "the quantitative condition is described in detail in the appendix .",
    "the domains of the non - tangential and near - tangential collisions should be chosen based on the critical angle we derived in section  [ s : transition ] .",
    "the additional step needed in computing collision rates is not computationally expensive by virtue of the large increase in available computing power since the 1960s .",
    "the neglect of near - tangential encounter cases has the potential to lead to erroneous results ; we demonstrated this by an exemplary , although extreme , case of the collision rates on earth of a population of particles in earth - like orbits .",
