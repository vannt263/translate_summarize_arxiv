    "luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath3 , @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 ) , emit most of their bolometric luminosity in the far - ir ( up to @xmath6 ) , and are the dominant class of galaxies in the local universe at these high luminosities @xcite .",
    "many lirgs are interacting / merging galaxies @xcite rich in molecular gas @xcite .",
    "it is not well understood whether starbursts produce most of the ir luminosity , how the starbursts are initiated and what role galaxy - galaxy interactions might play in triggering these starbursts .",
    "a study of the molecular gas properties at various phases of the merging process in lirgs would help identify the key physical processes involved .",
    "previous co imaging studies have concentrated on relatively advanced merger systems @xcite in which the interstellar medium ( ism ) has already been highly disrupted by the interaction and starbursts . in order to isolate the conditions in the ism _ leading _ to starbursts",
    ", we have started a program to study a sample of lirgs chosen to represent different phases of the interacting / merging process , using the newly expanded berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter - wave array @xcite .",
    "the goal is to sample statistically the evolution of physical conditions of the molecular material in lirgs as compared with the properties of the ir emission along the merger sequence .",
    "our sample emphasizes lirgs which appear to be in the early and intermediate stages of merging with large nuclear separation ( table 1 ) .",
    "these lirgs are potentially the most molecular gas - rich systems since the co luminosity is found to increase with increasing separation of the merging nuclei in a sample of @xmath7 50 lirg mergers @xcite .",
    "the bima array is ideally suited to study these early / intermediate lirg mergers given its large primary beam and wide spectral bandwidth .",
    "the observations presented here were all made with the 9-element bima array in the h / c configurations in 1996 .",

    "overlayed on broad - band images in 4 lirgs in an order of decreasing nuclei separation .",
    "although lirgs in our sample have very small ranges in l@xmath13 and l@xmath14 , the apparent differences in co morphology and gas properties are clearly seen along the merger sequence :    @xmath15 the morphology of the molecular gas in lirgs changes , along the merger sequence , from the weakly disturbed two separated gas disks , e.g. , early or pre - mergers like arp  302 @xcite and ngc  6670 @xmath16 the disturbed or merged - common - envelope gas disks ( intermediate mergers like arp  55 and mrk  848 ) @xmath16 a single common gas disk for the double nuclei of the two galaxies ( close to the advanced mergers like ngc  6090 )",
    ".    @xmath15 the total spatial co extent drops from @xmath7 20 kpc for the early mergers to a few kpc for the intermediate and advanced mergers .",
    "very advanced mergers like arp  220 have typical nuclear co concentration @xmath17 1 kpc @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 the corrected face - on central gas surface density ( lower - limits due to resolution ) increases from a few times 10@xmath18 pc@xmath12 to @xmath19 pc@xmath12 along the sequence . whereas advanced mergers such as arp  220 and mrk  273 have typical values @xmath20 pc@xmath12",
    ".    @xmath15 the @xmath21 ratio ( star formation efficiency , sfe ) increases by roughly a factor of two from the early mergers to the intermediate / advanced mergers .",
    "when we scale the ir luminosity and extent with those of the radio continuum emission @xcite using the well - known correlation between far - ir and radio continuum flux densities @xcite , we can estimate the central sfe ratio which tends to increase more drastically than the global sfe along the sequence ( see table  1 ) .",
    "@xmath15 the sfe ratio usually ranges from 20 to 100 @xmath22 in lirgs .",
    "however , we found that early mergers like arp  302 @xcite and ngc  6670 appear to have much smaller sfe throughout the entire interacting / merging disks , comparable to that of gmcs in the milky way disk .",
    "the level of star formation activity in early mergers is therefore remarkably similar to that of gmcs .",
    "this strongly suggests that lirgs in the early stage of merging are in a phase .",
    "@xmath15 in intermediate stage lirg mergers the starbursts appear to have `` turned - on '' , exhibited by higher sfe ratios especially in the nuclei .",
    "this may imply that starburst phase does not begin before the separation between the merging galaxies reaches roughly 10 kpc characterizing these intermediate stage lirg mergers .",
