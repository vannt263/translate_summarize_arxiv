    "@xmath59 is assumed which , when substituted into equation ( 5 ) recovers the relation of equation ( 3 ) .",

    "the time - averaged sed produced by the simulations had a jet break frequency which scales with luminosity as @xmath69 .",
    "we can compare equations ( 10 ) and ( 4 ) directly with the observations of jet breaks as shown in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "3 , respectively . one would only expect these relations to explain the data of all sources if other parameters that affect the jet break are the same for each source ( see below ) .",
    "this is unlikely , as it is known that some variable parameters of the inflow ( e.g. the disc temperature , disc inner radius ) differ between sources at the same luminosity , and some fundamental parameters ( e.g. the black hole mass ) also differ between sources .",
    "nevertheless , the large range of jet breaks at similar luminosities prevents there being one single relation between jet break frequency and luminosity .",
    "in addition , since two sources at @xmath70 possess jet break frequencies similar to the broad range seen at @xmath71 ( right panel of fig .",
    "3 ) , the predicted positive power law relation between luminosity and jet break frequency appears to be weak in the global sample ( although we do not have more than a few data points for each source ) .",

    "3 ( neglecting the data which represent only upper / lower limits on @xmath13 ) and arrive at a best fit empirical relation : @xmath73    this is a poor fit due to the two orders of magnitude of scatter in @xmath13 at a similar luminosity .",
    "however this best fit to the sample implies the jet break frequency could be independent of luminosity altogether ( i.e. , a power law index of zero ) , and the power law index is @xmath74 away from the expected relation of @xmath75 . the best fit is shown as a black line in the left panel of fig .",
    "3 ( with errors in the slope shown as dotted lines ) . in both panels of the figure",
    "the theoretical relations are shown in grey .",
    "since we are fitting a compilation of sources with typically one or two data points per source , we can not rule out the theoretical predicted relation being true for each source , but we can rule out a global relation applicable to all sources",
    ". it may be that some sources could obey the theoretical relation , but have different normalizations .",
    "this could be due to different values of the magnetic field strength or the radius of the faz at the same luminosity between sources .",
    "other parameters are likely to be changing on short timescales , and the global expected relation appears to be lost in the short term changes .",
    "this may be why the jet break of xte j1118 + 480 was seen to differ by a factor of 10 in frequency on two dates with very similar luminosities ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in addition",
    ", @xcite showed that @xmath13 shifted by a factor of 10 in frequency on hour timescales in gx 3394 while the x - ray luminosity remained largely unchanged on the same timescale .",
    "we note that the best power law fit to the global compilation of sources is sensitive to the two data points at low luminosity .",
    "while the jet break of a062000 in quiescence has been observed directly , the jet break of gro j0422 + 32 is inferred via interpolation , and its error bars are large because we can only infer limits on the spectral index and normalization of the optically thick spectrum .",
    "the large errors in @xmath13 for gro j0422 + 32 are not 1@xmath76 however ( they do not represent one standard deviation assuming a gaussian distribution of possible values of @xmath13 ) , and the break must reside in the frequency range indicated , for all possible values of @xmath54 and radio luminosity .",
    "more jet breaks identified at low luminosities would be beneficial to better constrain the best fit relation .",
    "jet models predict the jet break frequency to depend not only on the mass accretion rate , but also on the bh mass , magnetic field strength in the flow ( @xmath77 ) and the scale height of the launching region ( the faz ) , @xmath78 . in @xcite",
    "the hour - timescale variability of the jet break frequency was interpreted as dramatic changes in one or both of these two latter parameters .",

    "are both also expected to vary with mass accretion rate . here",

    "( 11 ) , we expect some scatter of the jet break frequency between different sources at the same luminosity if they have different bh masses . here",
    "we assess whether this could explain some of the observed scatter in fig .",

    "so the different bh masses in our sample can theoretically shift the jet break frequency by no more than a factor of 5.5 ( 0.7 dex ) between two bhs at the same luminosity .",

    "it has been shown that the jet break shifts on hour timescales in gx 3394 @xcite , which is not as rapid as the accretion rate changes that cause the fast variability . since",
    "the size of the emitting region at the jet break is likely to be light seconds across , these hour - long variations can not be due to individual plasma ejections .",
    "discrete jet ` shells ' with different velocities in the flow produce additional synchrotron emission when they collide ( aka ` internal shocks ' ) and this could be on timescales of hours , but are likely to produce emission at lower frequencies than the jet break frequency , as the plasma cools ( see * ? ? ? * for simulations of individual ejections and the broadband seds they produce ) .",

    "most jet models explored predict the magnetic field strength to decrease with distance @xmath86 along the length of the jet , due to the lateral expansion of the jet along its axis , and magnetic flux conservation . in the seminal model of compact , self - absorbed jets explored by @xcite , a conical jet with constant flow velocity",
    "has radius @xmath87 linearly proportional to @xmath86 , and thus @xmath88 .",

    "the first is that the optically thin power law extends to x - ray energies ( the high energy cutoff , or the cooling break , resides at energies @xmath120 kev ) .",
    "this cooling break is hard to detect , but observations have favoured a cooling break in the energy range @xmath12150 kev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent discussion ) .",
    "the second assumption is that of the spectral index of the optically thin power law . for each measurement of the jet break ,",
    "we compute the x - ray ( 210 kev ) luminosity of the extrapolated optically thin jet spectrum assuming its spectral index is @xmath122 ( a fairly typical spectral index ) . adopting different values of @xmath60 would shift each predicted x - ray luminosity systematically by the same amount in log(@xmath106 ) .",
    "5 shows the predicted x - ray luminosity of the optically thin jet power law plotted against the observed x - ray luminosity . for all bhxbs except those in quiescence ,",
    "the predicted jet luminosity is approximately equal to , or less than the observed x - ray luminosity . above the quiescent luminosity ,",
    "all bhxbs have x - ray luminosities that are no brighter than @xmath123 times the predicted jet luminosity .",
    "the only exceptions are cyg x1 , which is @xmath124 times more luminous , and the neutron star xb 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "it has been shown that in both of these objects , the x - ray emission is very unlikely to originate from synchrotron emission from the jet @xcite .",
    "5 confirms this for these two sources .    for most bhxbs , the jet luminosity underpredicts the observed x - ray luminosity by a factor of up to ten , implying that the jet does not dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "this is consistent with the standard picture of the comptonized corona producing the x - ray power law in the hard state ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "we have here showed however that the jet emission could typically contribute more than 10 per cent of the x - ray flux , if the cooling break does not reside at lower energies than the x - ray band .    at @xmath125 , three sources (",
    "xte j1118 + 480 , 4u 154347 and xte j1550564 ) have observed x - ray luminosities within a factor of two of the predicted jet luminosities .",
    "empirical evidence has favoured a jet origin to the x - ray emission at this luminosity in xte j1550564 @xcite .",
    "xte j1118 + 480 was the first bhxb that was proposed to have a jet dominating the x - ray luminosity , and this was at a similar x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "5 suggests that the jet of 4u 154347 may also have dominated its x - ray luminosity at @xmath126 .",
    "the data are broadly consistent with the suggestion that the jet does not dominate the x - ray luminosity above @xmath127 @xmath18 , but may do below that luminosity @xcite .",
    "the two quiescent bhxbs have observed x - ray luminosities that are several orders of magnitude ( three in the case of a062000 ) fainter than the predicted jet luminosity . for this to occur ,",
    "the cooling break in the jet spectrum must lie at energies much lower than the x - ray regime ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "it is possible that the optically thin spectral index becomes steeper ( e.g. @xmath129 ) at lower luminosities .",
    "a correlation was found between @xmath60 and luminosity for xte j1550564 , in which it was as steep as @xmath130 at the lowest luminosities as the jet first appeared after the soft - to - hard state transition @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that the measured x - ray spectral index of quiescent bhxbs is generally steeper ( @xmath131 ) than is typical for the hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the observed spectral indices in quiescence are consistent with that expected from the jet at energies higher than the cooling break ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps this implies that the origin of the x - ray emission in quiescent bhxbs is the jet ( as predicted by , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is speculative . we can conclude that it is likely that the high energy break in the jet spectrum shifts from x - ray energies at @xmath7 to uv energies at @xmath132 .",
    "we have collected multiwavelength seds of bhxbs in their hard x - ray states .",
    "synchrotron emission from the jets launched in these systems is identified spectrally , and constraints on the frequency and luminosity of the characteristic break in the jet spectrum have been achieved for a total of eight bhxbs .",
    "we detect the jet break directly in the sed of v404 cyg during its 1989 outburst , at @xmath1 hz ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "jet break frequencies span more than two orders of magnitude , and there appears to be no strong global relation between jet break frequency and luminosity from @xmath1331 @xmath18 . in two sources , gx 3394 and xte j1118 + 480 ,",
    "the jet break frequency varies by more than one order of magnitude while the change in luminosity is negligible ( seen on hour - timescales by * ? ? ? * in the case of gx 3394 ) .",
    "the wide scatter in the relation between jet break frequency and luminosity may be due to the magnetic field strength and/or the radius of the launching region in the jet varying dramatically , causing large shifts in the jet break frequency , and suppressing the visibility of any global relation with luminosity .",
    "different bh masses in different sources are unlikely to cause much of the scatter , but differences in the magnetic field strength , radius of the faz , or the jet radiative efficiency could contribute to the scatter in jet break frequencies .",
    "the high energy ( cooling ) break in the jet spectrum appears to shift in frequency , from uv energies at @xmath132 ( quiescence ) to x - ray energies at @xmath7 .",
    "we find a power law correlation between the jet peak flux ( i.e. , at the jet break frequency ) and the x - ray luminosity for hard state bhxbs ; @xmath8 ; very similar to the well documented radio  x - ray correlation .",
    "this implies a radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the hard state ; @xmath134 .",
    "the bhxbs that are radio - faint in the radio  x - ray correlation ( or perform transitions between being radio - faint and radio - bright ) are also ir - faint , and the radio to ir spectral index of the jet is independent of luminosity .",

    "<S> in x - ray binaries , compact jets are known to commonly radiate at radio to infrared frequencies , whereas at optical to @xmath0-ray energies , the contribution of the jet is debated . </S>",
    "<S> the total luminosity , and hence power of the jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum , between optically thick ( self - absorbed ) and optically thin synchrotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> this break , or turnover , has been reported in just one black hole x - ray binary ( bhxb ) thus far , gx 3394 , and inferred via spectral fitting in two others , a062000 and cyg x1 . here , we collect a wealth of multiwavelength data from the outbursts of bhxbs during hard x - ray states , in order to search for jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions . in particular , we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum of v404 cyg during its 1989 outburst , at @xmath1 hz ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we increase the number of bhxbs with measured jet breaks from three to eight . </S>",
    "<S> jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than two orders of magnitude , from @xmath3 hz for xte j1118 + 480 during its 2005 outburst , to @xmath4 hz for v4641 sgr in outburst . a positive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity </S>",
    "<S> is expected theoretically ; @xmath5 if other parameters are constant . with constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 bhxbs including two quiescent systems </S>",
    "<S> , we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similar luminosities and no obvious global relation ( but such a relation can not be ruled out for individual sources ) . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that different magnetic field strengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regions of the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter between sources . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence that the high energy cooling break in the jet spectrum shifts from uv energies at @xmath6 ( implying the jet may dominate the x - ray emission in quiescence ) to x - ray energies at @xmath7 . finally , we find that the jet break luminosity scales as @xmath8 ( very similar to the radio  x - ray correlation ) , and radio - faint bhxbs have fainter jet breaks . </S>",
    "<S> in quiescence the jet break luminosity exceeds the x - ray luminosity .    </S>",
