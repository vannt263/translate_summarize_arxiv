    "no physical explanation has been put forth for intrinsic redshifts and qso ejections . the observations supporting these hypotheses can be easily explained by hgt without inventing new physics by recognizing that the galaxies and qsos are aligned by perspective , and stay aligned along narrow lines of sight as the universe expands because their sticky beginnings allow only small transverse velocities .",

    "the ill - posed jeans 1902 theory ( neglecting non - acoustic density perturbations ) is far too limited a basis for discussion of structure formation because it neglects viscous forces , turbulence forces , non - acoustic density fluctuations , particle collisions , and the effects of diffusion on gravitational structure formation .",
    "jeans did linear perturbation stability analysis ( neglecting turbulence ) of euler s equations ( neglecting viscous forces ) to reduce the problem of gravitational instability of a nearly uniform ideal gas with density @xmath8 only a function of pressure ( the barotropic assumption ) to one of gravitational acoustics .",
    "furthermore , to reconcile his equations with the linearized collisionless boltzmann s equations and the resulting poisson s equation for the gravitational potential @xcite , jeans assumed the density was zero in a maneuver appropriately known as the `` jeans swindle '' .",

    "density fluctuations in natural fluids are generally not barotropic as assumed by jeans 1902 except in small regions and short times near powerful sound sources , but are dominated by non - acoustic ( non - barotropic ) density variations from turbulent mixing of temperature or chemical species concentrations @xcite . even in the context of jeans theory ( without the jeans swindle ) , any gravitational condensation on an acoustical density maximum rapidly converts to a non - acoustical density maximum because the accreted mass retains the momentum of the presumed motionless ambient gas . at this point one",
    "faces the more realistic problem of gravitational structure formation in a moving , viscous , diffusive , possibly turbulent gas that was addressed by gibson 1996 .",
    "turbulence or viscous forces will dominate gravitational forces at small distances from a non - acoustic point of maximum or minimum density , but gravitational forces will dominate turbulent or viscous forces at larger distances if the gas does not diffuse away faster than it can condense or rarify due to gravity .",
    "the jeans 1902 analysis fails because the problem was ill posed .",
    "self - gravitational structure formation in nature occurs on non - acoustic density maxima and minima , not sound wave crests , but jeans started by assuming a uniform density , and was forced to set the density to zero in the jeans swindle to avoid the nonlinear problems of non - acoustic density maxima forming at acoustic wavecrests .",
    "the geometry of evolving non - acoustic density fields at scales @xmath84 is shown in figure 1 , with ( top ) and without ( bottom ) self - gravitational instability . without self - gravity a quasi - equilibrium at the batchelor length scale ( table 1 ) exists , where the competition between diffusive smoothing of density gradients and strain rate steepening produces a universal turbulent mixing scale @xmath85 at points of maximum and minimum density @xcite that begin to decay by diffusion as soon as turbulence scrambles a uniform density gradient to form such extrema with zero density gradients , as shown by experiments and numerical simulations @xcite . without gravity , points of maximum density always decrease by diffusion and points of minimum density increase , always moving and diffusing back toward the original configuration with uniform gradient and no density extrema .",
    "evidence of primordial turbulence in cmb anisotropies @xcite suggests non - acoustic density maxima necessary to seed primordial gravitational structures were available in the plasma epoch . assuming the same initial density conditions as fig .",
    "1 ( top ) , the evolution of density with self gravity ( bottom ) is very different .",
    "the reason is that gravity has the effect of causing a negative diffusivity @xmath86 for distances @xmath87 close to the points of zero density gradient and maximum or minimum density value .",
    "negative density diffusivity causes absolute gravitational instability at non - acoustic density extrema . with self gravity ( bottom )",
    "density maxima increase their density values toward infinity and density minima decrease their density values toward zero . both experience exponential growth to form condensates and voids for all length scales @xmath88 unless limited by turbulent , viscous or diffusive effects at the appropriate schwarz length scales .",
    "consider a well posed problem in self - gravitation .",
    "a mass perturbation @xmath89 with scale @xmath90 suddenly placed in a motionless fluid of constant density @xmath8 at time @xmath91 will increase as @xmath92 $ ] unless viscous , turbulent , other forces or diffusion arise to prevent the exponential growth @xcite .",
    "everything slowly begins to move toward or away from the mass perturbation for @xmath93 and everything happens at once at @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath95 the radial velocity @xmath96 from newton s law of gravity , so the mass flow @xmath97 and density @xmath8 are independent of radius .",
    "thus , @xmath98 , so @xmath99 . since everything happens within @xmath45 of the perturbation at @xmath100 , any `` pressure support '' mechanism is confined to this small space - time region and has no affect on the weakly accelerated fluid that slowly gains momentum at scales @xmath101 and @xmath102 for times @xmath103 .",
    "since it takes a time @xmath100 for a sound wave to reach a distance @xmath104 in time @xmath105 , any hypothetical acoustic `` pressure support '' mechanism of the jeans criterion would be too late to prevent the exponential density singularity at @xmath100 .",
    "note that the time required for self - gravitational structure formation depends almost entirely on the mean density @xmath8 and only very slightly on the size of the density perturbation @xmath106 .",
    "the diffusion velocity is @xmath107 for diffusivity @xmath108 at distance @xmath45 and the gravitational velocity is @xmath109 .",
    "the two velocities are equal at the diffusive schwarz length scale @xmath110^{1/4}.\\ ] ] weakly collisional particles such as the hypothetical cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) material can not possibly form potential wells for baryonic matter collection because such particles have large diffusivity and will disperse , consistent with observations @xcite .",

    "cdm particles have @xmath116 m@xmath71 or less compared to baryonic @xmath117 m@xmath71 values .",
    "weakly collisional particles thus have large collision distances @xmath35 and therefore large diffusivities @xmath108 and large diffusive schwarz lengths @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , the non - baryonic dark matter ( possibly neutrinos ) must be the last material to fragment by self gravity and not the first as assumed by cdm cosmologies . in hgt galaxy formation @xcite , the nbdm diffuses to form either an outer halo of the galaxy",
    "if the galaxy is isolated , or diffuses completely away from the baryonic galaxy to become part of a galaxy cluster halo or galaxy supercluster halo at mpc scales @xmath119 m or more .",
    "the baryonic matter is subject to large viscous forces , especially in the hot primordial plasma from photon viscosity and gas states from large @xmath112 values existing when most gravitational structures first formed , where @xmath120 if @xmath121 .",
    "the viscous forces per unit volume @xmath122 dominate gravitational forces @xmath123 at small scales , where @xmath124 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath125 is the rate of strain of the fluid .",
    "the forces match at the viscous schwarz length @xmath126 which is the smallest size for self gravitational condensation or void formation in such a flow .",
    "turbulent forces may require even larger scales of gravitational structures .",
    "turbulent forces @xmath127 match gravitational forces at the turbulent schwarz scale @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the viscous dissipation rate of the turbulence .",
    "thus in strongly turbulent regions with large @xmath129 values one expects large stars to form because the turbulent schwarz scales are larger than any other hydro - gravitational scale . in the cold , turbulent , dense molecular clouds of the milky way galaxy disk where the jeans mass is near @xmath130 or less , few stars form",
    "compared to the rate expected by the jeans criterion because @xmath131 .",
    "the jeans criterion is nearly irrelevant to gravitational structure formation triggered by non - acoustic density maxima and minima where structures can form at scales that are either larger or smaller than @xmath9 . by jeans criterion no structures can form in the primordial plasma because @xmath9 during this hot , dense",
    ", epoch is always larger than the scale of causal connection @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the speed of light and @xmath134 is the time since the big bang .",
    "however , the viscous and turbulent schwarz scales @xmath135 became smaller than @xmath9 during this period , and first matched the more rapidly increasing @xmath24 at time @xmath136 seconds @xcite , well before @xmath137 seconds which is the time of plasma to gas transition ( 300,000 years ) . because the expansion of the universe inhibited condensation but enhanced void formation in the weakly turbulent plasma , the first structures were proto - supercluster - voids . at @xmath138 s the reynolds number was near critical so that @xmath139 where @xmath118 applies to the non - baryonic component and @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 apply to the baryonic component .",
    "as proto - supercluster fragments formed the voids between filled with non - baryonic matter by diffusion , inhibiting further structure formation by decreasing the gravitational driving force . the baryonic mass density @xmath143 kg/@xmath144 and rate of strain @xmath145 @xmath146 were preserved as hydrodynamic fossils within the proto - supercluster fragments and within proto - cluster and proto - galaxy objects resulting from subsequent fragmentation as the photon viscosity and @xmath140 decreased prior to the plasma - gas transition and photon decoupling @xcite .",
    "as shown in eq .",
    "5 , the kolmogorov scale @xmath147^{1/4}$ ] at the time of first structure nearly matched the horizon scale @xmath132 and the viscous and turbulent schwarz scales , freezing in the density , strain - rate , and spin magnitudes and directions of the proto - cluster and proto - galaxy fragments of proto - superclusters .",
    "remnants of the strain - rate and spin magnitudes and directions of the weak turbulence at the time of first structure formation are forms of fossil vorticity turbulence @xcite .",
    "thus hgt naturally explains observed bright galaxy spin alignments and close angular associations with each other and quasars without assuming intrinsic red shifts and mutual ejections .",
    "the quiet condition of the primordial gas is revealed by measurements of temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , which show an average @xmath148 , much too small for any turbulence to have existed at that time of plasma - gas transition .",
    "this is to be expected because any turbulent plasma motions would have been strongly damped by buoyancy forces after the first gravitational fragmentation time @xmath138 s. viscous forces in the plasma are inadequate to explain the lack of primordial turbulence ( kinematic viscosity @xmath124",

    "the gas temperature , density , viscosity , and rate of strain are all precisely known at transition , so the gas viscous schwarz mass @xmath151 is @xmath152 kg , the mass of a small planet , or @xmath153 . from hgt , soon after the cooling primordial plasma turned to gas at @xmath137 s ( 300,000 yr ) , the entire baryonic universe condensed to a fog of planetary - mass primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) .",

    "proto - galaxies fragmented at the pfp scale but also at this proto - globular - star - cluster pgc scale @xmath9 , although not for the reason given by the jeans 1902 theory . density fluctuations in the gaseous proto - galaxies were absolutely unstable to void formation at all scales larger than the viscous schwarz scale @xmath140 .",
    "pressure can only remain in equilibrium with density without temperature changes in a gravitationally expanding void on scales smaller than the jeans scale . from the second law of thermodynamics ,",
    "rarefaction wave speeds that develop as density minima expand due to gravity to form voids are limited to speeds less than the sonic velocity .",
    "cooling would therefore occur and be compensated by radiation in the otherwise isothermal primordial gas when the expanding voids approached the jeans scale .",
    "gravitational fragmentation of proto - galaxies will then be accelerated by radiative heat transfer to these cooler regions , resulting in fragmentation at the jeans scale and isolation of proto - globular - star - clusters ( pgcs ) with the primordial - gas - jeans - mass .",
    "these @xmath159 kg pgc objects were not able to collapse from their own self gravity because of their internal fragmentation at the viscous schwarz scale to form @xmath160 kg pfps .",
    "the fact that globular star clusters have precisely the same density and primordial - gas - jeans - mass from galaxy to galaxy proves they were all formed simultaneously soon after the time of the plasma to gas transition @xmath137 s. the gas has never been so uniform since , and no mechanism exists to recover such a high density , let alone such a high uniform density , as the fossil turbulent density value @xmath161 kg/@xmath144 .",
    "young globular cluster formation in bdm halos in the tadpole , mice , and antennae galaxy mergers show that dark pgc clusters of pfps are remarkably stable structures , persisting without disruption or star formation for more than ten billion years .",
    "so the proto - galaxies ( pgs ) before stars were rapidly fragmented at both the jeans and viscous schwarz scales to form pgcs , a million per galaxy , with embedded pfps , a trillion per pgc and @xmath162 per pg .",
    "viscous forces inhibited the formation of larger planetoids by accretion of the pfps except at the cores of the pgcs and the cores of the pgs .",
    "it was a very quiet and gentle time .",
    "the gentleness of this time of first star formation is reflected in the small , uniformly distributed , long - lived , population ii stars of the ancient globular - star - clusters observed in the milky way galaxy .",
    "the time to form the first of these stars was probably one million years ( the primordial density free fall time ) , not the 275 million `` dark age '' years required by the standard cdm model while the cdm halos formed by frictionless clustering of cdm seeds .",
    "open star clusters formed from captured and disrupted pgcs in the galaxy disk are exposed to higher levels of radiation and tidal friction than pgcs in the bdm halo , and form large irregularly distributed stars .",
    "the large sizes of the disk stars and their slow rate of formation reflect the high turbulence levels of disk star forming regions ( from supernovas ) compared to the low turbulence levels existing where stars are formed in isolated pgcs . from hgt , the thin disks of spiral galaxies are accretion disks forming within large , massive , spherical bdm halos surrounding the original smaller denser @xmath163 m galaxy cores from which the pgcs diffused , rather than collapsed gaseous pancakes in cdm halos as envisaged in cdm standard models .",
    "relatively low gas levels are observed in spiral galaxy cores according to hgt , where excess gas is frozen out on the ambient pfps .",
    "with the expansion of the universe and further cooling , the pgcs and pfps cooled as well , reaching the 14 k freezing point of hydrogen at about a redshift of 30 at a time about 80 my . because most of the gas is isolated in individual pfps separated from their neighbors by distances of about @xmath164 m corresponding to the primordial density , and because most pfps within a pgc are initially surrounded homogeneously by identical objects with the same spacing , the tendency without external forcing would be for them to slow down due to friction from the inter - pfp gas and remain isolated indefinitely .",
    "after freezing , the pfp collision cross section will decrease but the inter - pfp gas density and friction will also decrease , permitting speedup of the pfps and a new meta - stable state of equilibrium .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough phenomenon shows intergalactic gas effectively vanishes for red shifts smaller than 6 ( @xmath165 700 my ) in quasar spectra with their lyman-@xmath166 forests of intervening galaxies .",
    "this suggests that most baryonic - dark - matter galaxy halo gas has frozen out on pfps embedded in the bdm halos at times less than a billion years after the big bang .",
    "as the inter - pgc gas density decreases with time since pfp creation , these pgc clumps of condensing baryonic dark matter become increasingly collisionless and diffusional .",
    "those formed near the core of the proto - galaxy have a higher likelihood of mutual capture , interaction , disruption , and conversion to stars , but those formed on the periphery of the proto - galaxy will tend to either capture each other to form proto - dwarf - galaxies or diffuse to larger and larger orbits . the inner pgcs should be the most agitated by tidal forces and therefore the most likely to form stars and eventually the full population of @xmath167 stars observed in a globular star cluster .",
    "those further out might form only a few thousand stars and drift to the outskirts of the luminous portion of the galaxy , sometimes being captured or disrupted by the disk , but the largest number diffusing farther out to form the baryonic - dark - matter ( bdm ) halo of the galaxy , invisible unless disturbed by intruders as in the case of the tadpole merging galaxy system ( vv29=arp 188=ugc 10214 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the hst / acs image with its combination of wide field and high resolution , which clearly reveals the existence of star wakes , a dark dwarf galaxy and young - globular - clusters triggered into existence from the dark baryonic - dark - matter halo by the merging cluster of galaxy components vv29cdef as they spiral in to the central galaxy vv29a and merge @xcite .",
    "sparse globular clusters such as palomar 5 with luminous mass @xmath168 and palomar 13 with luminous mass @xmath169 observed in the milky way are likely dim rather than disrupted pgcs with 98% to 99.9% of their mass intact as dark - matter pfps .",
    "nearly half of the stars of pal 5 are observed as long tidal tails along its orbit about the galaxy center @xcite , suggesting that the same tidal forces that produced the tails may also be producing the stars from a large supply of remaining pfps .",
    "the amount of dark matter in dim globular clusters like pal 5 and pal 13 in the milky way , and in galactic dwarf spherical galaxies ( dsphs ) , is likely underestimated in virial estimates @xmath170 of the dark mass @xmath171 because friction from pfp gas is neglected that reduces the velocity variance @xmath172 of the stars within radius @xmath173 . a mass - to - light ratio @xmath174 for palomar 13",
    "was recently reported @xcite , which is the first estimate from @xmath172 measurements in dim globular star clusters and is much higher than @xmath175 expected . in another estimate ( cote et al .",

    "large @xmath178 values measured in dsph galaxies have been assumed to reflect non - baryonic cdm halos @xcite , but from tadpole we see pgc and dsph dark matter is mostly baryonic because it forms stars when agitated .",
    "the hydro - gravitation - theory ( hgt ) scenario presented here is significantly different from standard cdmhc cosmology based on jeans 1902 precepts .",
    "gravitational structures in the baryonic matter fragmented during the plasma epoch with supercluster to galaxy masses .",
    "the protosuperclusters have the observed uniform supercluster mass of about @xmath179 kg ( including their non - baryonic halos ) , with a uniformity not expected for hierarchical clustering of cdm halos assumed in the standard cdmhc model .",
    "weak primordial turbulence is damped by buoyancy forces of the first structures to form fossil vorticity turbulence @xcite .",
    "the density and rate - of - strain values at the time of first structure ( @xmath138 s ) are preserved ( fossilized ) , and can still be detected in the density of globular star clusters and the masses of pfps .",
    "the non - baryonic matter diffused to fill the protosuperclustervoids , limiting the amplitude of the density contrast formed to the small values observed in the cmb .",
    "superclusters , clusters and galaxies never contracted or collapsed but continue to fragment and gently expand at slower rates than the rest of the universe .",
    "evidence supporting the hydro - gravitational theory of structure formation is gradually accumulating .",
    "high resolution telescope images in star forming regions and supernova remnants are full of poorly explained small objects , knots and `` ejecta '' that are likely to be evaporating pfps .",
    "cometary globules and the huge masses of gas observed by the hst near hot dying stars in planetary nebulae are much more easily explained as the result of evaporating ambient pfps in the interstellar medium than they are as ejecta .",
    "plasma beams from young stars produce herbig - haro objects with cometary tails , and the plasma beams themselves pulsate as though the accreted material forming the star contained planetary mass chunks .",
    "numerous brown dwarfs and jupiters have been detected whose origin is mysterious without hgt .",
    "the total mass of extra - solar planets discovered increases with decreasing planet - mass , even though low mass extra - solar planets are more difficult to detect , as expected if extra - solar planets are formed by accretion of ambient pfps before their capture by stars .",
    "the closest planetary nebula is helix , figure 2 , where some 6500 cometary globules have been identified , each with mass about @xmath180 kg and size @xmath137 m , and separated by about @xmath164 m @xcite .",
    "radial tails point away from the hot , central , white dwarf star at @xmath181 m. the mass @xmath182 kg and separation distances @xmath183 m of the helix cometary globules give a halo density @xmath184 kg m@xmath4 , suggesting that pfps originally in a sphere with radius @xmath181 m have accreted to form the central star out of an ism with mass dominated by pfps , with primordial density @xmath184 kg m@xmath4 , leaving pfps at the hole boundary ( oort cloud ) evaporated and illuminated by the hot dying star .",
    "measured evaporation rates @xcite are too high for the globules shown in figure 2 to be pfps , so they must be jpps with at least jupiter mass to have survived this long @xcite .",
    "if the ism surrounding the helix represents a dark proto - globular - star - cluster ( pgc ) , the pn represents the luminous boundary of a hole formed by accreted pfps to form the illuminating central star , with mass @xmath185 of the surrounding ism pgc baryonic dark matter cloud of pfps .",
    "the gas in the nebula is of order the mass of the star , but the total mass of the atmosphere of the dying star before it is ejected should be less than about @xmath186 .",
    "the mass density for the helix globules @xmath187 kg/@xmath144 is three orders of magnitude larger than the density of any atmosphere ejected by the white dwarf star .",
    "shock waves can increase densities by no more than factors @xmath188 , not the factors @xmath189 required to explain the objects of figure 2 .",
    "these cometary globules are usually explained as due to rayleigh - taylor instability , where a dense gas shell ejected first is accelerated by a lighter shell ejected more rapidly later , but rt instability can not increase the density of the dense shell by many orders of magnitude or decrease the density in the rt fingers to form wakes as observed .",
    "rt fingers only form in a narrow range of reynolds numbers near critical , but this is not the case for the helix objects . if the cometary globule separations in helix reflects that of the ambient pfp population , the mass density of pfps is near the value @xmath3 kg/@xmath144 expected for a pgc .",
    "the pgc may have supplied the pfps from which the helix star was formed , consistent with the size of the @xmath190 m region surrounding the white dwarf that is observed to be empty of cometary globules @xcite .    however , the most conclusive and convincing evidence for the pgc - pfp hgt scenario is still the technically challenging one of quasar microlensing . the schild 1996 interpretation that the qso 0957 + 561a , b quasar lens galaxy must be dominated by planetary mass objects",
    "is based on the observed high twinkling frequency of the two quasar images a , b .",
    "the initially controversial schild time delay has now been confirmed by several independent observers , and is in the process of further refinement by an international team of observers using telescopes at sufficient points on the earth to provide continuous coverage and independent confirmation of the twinkling qso 0957 + 561a , b light curves ( colley et al . 2002 , 2003 ) . at this time",
    "four other lensed quasars have been observed with sufficiently precise time delays of the mirage images to extract the planetary mass twinkling frequencies , and these have been observed and reported ( burud et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; hjorthe et al .",
    "2002 , schechter et al .",
    "the specific microlensing profile discovered in q0957 by colley and schild ( 2003 ) with high statistical significance shows that the lens galaxy g1 halo population has a significant optical depth of planetary mass objects , and the double - ring halo model of schild and vakulik ( 2003 ) shows how such rapid microlensing plausibly follows from simulations .",
    "evidence of substructure in several lensing galaxies is reported by dalal and kochanek 2002 from the difference in brightness of the background source mirages , with substructure masses in the range @xmath191 .",
    "this evidence is presented to suggest that the missing cdm halos of the local group of galaxies is not a crisis for the hierarchical cdm model of galaxy formation that overestimates the numbers of dwarf galaxies by orders of magnitude compared to observations because the actual galaxy substructures may be dark .",
    "however , the substructure evidence @xcite of dark non - baryonic cdm halos may also be interpreted as evidence that significant fractions of the lens galaxies central masses are in dark baryonic clumps .",
    "dark pgc clumps of pfps dominating central galaxy masses is predicted by hgt .",
    "clumps of dark pgcs triggered to form clumps of ygcs by the star formation wake of vv29c are indicated in the vv29b filament of tadpole by the hst / acs images @xcite , figure 3 .",
    "merging galaxy systems such as the tadpole , mice , and antennae are characterized by the appearance out of the dark of young - globular - clusters ( ygcs ) and large quantities of gas .",
    "using the hst and a wide variety of other telescopes to cover a broad range of frequencies @xcite , nearly a thousand ygcs have been identified and studied in the antennae system ( ngc 4038/9 ) , which is the closest merging galaxy system at only @xmath192 m. at this distance the clusters are well resolved .",
    "the mass function inferred from the luminosity for the young ( 5 myr ) globular clusters in antennae @xcite is very different than that for old ( @xmath193 gyr ) globular clusters ( ogcs ) , falling with power law slope -2 from a maximum near @xmath194 rather than showing the narrow lognormal peak near @xmath195 widely observed for ogcs .",
    "the brightest ygcs have the same mass as the ogcs .",
    "we suggest that the low masses of the most numerous ygcs is simply because most of the mass of the pgcs from which these ygcs are forming is still tied up in dark matter pfps that are rapidly accreting to form stars under the influence of the tidal merger .",
    "figure 4 shows an hst image of stephan s quintet ( sq , hgc 92 , arp 319 , vv 288 ) which is number 92 in the hickson catalog of compact clusters .",
    "like over 40@xmath196 of the hgcs , the sq galaxies @xcite have highly discordant redshifts .",
    "these are easily explained by hgt , where the sq and other hgc galaxies with discordant redshifts represent galaxy clusters that have gently separated only recently due to the expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the star wakes in figure 4 show luminous evidence of the baryonic dark matter cluster halo and its boundary .",
    "no evidence of a galaxy merger is shown , in contrast to the tadpole merger in figure 3 where the merged galaxy is revealed .",
    "numerous young globular clusters ( ygcs ) have been identified in sq @xcite , confirming the hgt prediction that the baryonic dark matter consists of pgc clumps of pfps that can be triggered to form stars by radiation and tidal forces .",
    "figure 5 shows the tomographic mass distribution of the rich galaxy cluster abell 1689 determined from the gravitational distortion of 6000 background galaxy images by 4000 foreground galaxies in the cluster @xcite .",
    "a mass to light ratio of about 400 suggests the cluster halo is non - baryonic dark matter with an extent determined by the nbdm particle diffusivity @xmath197 and the large cluster density .",
    "the schwarz diffusive scale @xmath198 from the mass profile is @xmath199 m , giving @xmath200 m@xmath6 s@xmath2 from the cluster density @xmath201 kg m@xmath4 .",
    "such a large diffusivity excludes any possibility that the outer dark matter halo is baryonic .",
    "it fixes the value of the @xmath202 ratio to a value @xmath203 kg m@xmath68 . because the maximum collision cross section @xmath115 for non - baryonic matter is about @xmath204 m@xmath6 ,",
    "the maximum particle mass for the nbdm is @xmath205 kg , excluding wimps with @xmath206 kg as nbdm candidates by large factors .",
    "for example , the neutralino mass is about @xmath207 kg , giving a @xmath115 value of @xmath208 m@xmath6 , which is so large that neutralino - nbdm would be easily detected .",
    "the nbdm becomes unstable to gravitational fragmentation when @xmath118 becomes less than the horizon scale @xmath24 .",
    "this occurs at @xmath209 , soon after the plasma - gas transition at 300,000 years , for the indicated diffusivity .",
    "outer halos scale with @xmath210 so the galaxy nbdm outer - halo - radius is @xmath211 m , or about four times the observed bdm inner - halo - radius for the tadpole galaxy @xcite .",
    "since baryons can be no more than @xmath212 of the mass of a flat universe from nucleosynthesis , non - baryons can be no more than @xmath213 times the mass of baryons . thus ( neglecting any @xmath26 contribution ) galaxy outer halo densities are dominated by non - baryons and galaxy inner halo densities are dominated by baryons .",
    "high resolution images of the helix nebula , the tadpole merger and the stephan quintet ( sq ) compact cluster support the hydro - gravitational theory ( hgt ) prediction that primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) in proto - globular - star - clusters ( pgcs ) dominate baryonic dark matter ( bdm ) inner - galaxy - halos and the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "young globular clusters and star wake alignments in tadpole and sq are explained by hgt and are not explained by previous models .",
    "evidence accumulates showing high frequency twinkling of quasar images lensed by foreground galaxies , confirming that the galaxy missing baryonic mass is dominated by pfp mass `` rogue planets '' @xcite .",
    "large numbers of extra - solar planets have been discovered with jupiter mass which must be made of h - he gas , but which are shown to be impossible by the jeans 1902 gravitational structure formation criterion in @xmath214 .",
    "such planets can not be formed by condensation on rocky cores because the formation of rocks is also impossible by the jeans criterion .",
    "jupiters and rocks form naturally using hydro - gravitational theory @xcite by accretion of pfps to form larger planets and stars , and by gravitational accumulation of the dust of supernovas by pfps and larger planets to form rocky cores .",
    "the helix nebula and other planetary nebula show evidence that the ism mass is dominated by pfps as predicted by hgt .",
    "these accrete to form jpps ; jupiters , brown dwarfs and stars .",
    "evidence that the total mass of small extra - solar jpps exceeds the total mass of larger extra - solar jpps , as expected from hgt , suggests that the total mass of brown dwarfs in a galaxy exceeds the mass of stars .",
    "this prediction of hgt can be tested by the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) when it is launched , possibly this year .",
    "stephan s quintet is an example of many compact clusters of galaxies with discordant red shifts that refute cdmhcc and support hgt .",
    "hst images confirm the pgc - pfp baryonic dark matter halo model indicated by the tadpole merger , but show star wakes of cluster galaxies separating through the bdm cluster halo rather than merging as shown by tadpole and as predicted by hgt .",
    "angular clustering of qsos and bright galaxies @xcite also rule out cdmhcc and support either hgt without new physics or intrinsic red shifts and qso ejection by agn galaxies @xcite and a possible failure of the big bang hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the forty year authoritative accumulation of inexplicable angular clustering of galaxies , clusters and qsos with anomalous red shifts are readily explained by hgt as the result of perspective and gentle straining along lines of sight by the expansion of the universe , with small transverse velocities reflecting the viscous origins and frictional effects of fragmenting clusters in gassy , baryonic , galaxy and cluster halos .    from hgt and the mass distribution",
