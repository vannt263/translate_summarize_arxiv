    "the giant stellar stream ( gss - also known as the giant southern stream ) constitutes a major substructure in the halo of our neighbor galaxy m31 .",
    "it was discovered in 2001 from a survey of the southeastern inner halo of m31 undertaken with the wide field camera on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "followup observations with the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) further revealed the enormous extent of the stream , spanning at least @xmath17 of sky ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a projected size in excess of @xmath18 kpc at m31 halo distances .",
    "a high - density stellar stream of these proportions is a structure seldom seen in the local group and its importance for understanding the evolution of the m31 system can not be overestimated .",
    "the gss has proven to exhibit a complex morphology , with a wide spread in metallicities and evidence for more than one stellar population . based on stellar isochrone fitting , @xcite found evidence for a more metal rich core , surrounded by a sheath of bluer metal poor stars , which combine to produce a luminosity of @xmath19 @xmath20 ( a total absolute magnitude of @xmath21 ) .",
    "similarly , studies such as @xcite and later @xcite find two kinematically separated populations in several inner fields of the stream , using data obtained with the deimos spectrograph on the 10 m keck ii telescope .",
    "@xcite again report a more metal poor envelope enclosing the core .",
    "@xcite use data from the same source to deduce a mean metallicity of @xmath22 = -0.51 $ ] toward the far end of the stream , suggesting the gss is slightly more metal rich than the surrounding halo stars in this region . using deep photometry obtained of an inner stream field via the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys , @xcite compare their data with isochrone grids to ascertain a mean age of @xmath23 gyr and a mean metallicity of @xmath22 = -0.7 $ ] ( slightly more metal poor than the spheroid population studied ) but note a large spread in both parameters .",
    "further to this , @xcite have shown that star formation in the stream started early and quenched about 5 gyr ago , by which time the metallicity of the stream progenitor had already reached solar levels .",
    "on the basis of this , they propose an early type system as the stream progenitor , perhaps a de or spiral bulge .",
    "detailed age and metallicity distributions are also included in this contribution .    by combining distance estimates for the stream , particularly those presented in @xcite , with kinematic data , it is possible to constrain the orbit of the stream progenitor , and also to measure the dark matter halo potential within the orbit .",
    "numerous studies have been dedicated to these aims , such as that of @xcite which uses the results of @xcite to infer a highly elliptical orbit for the progenitor , viewed close to edge - on . both @xcite and , more recently , @xcite have obtained mass estimates for m31 using the gss , with the latter incorporating a mass estimate for the progenitor comparable to the mass of the large magellanic cloud .",
    "whilst the distance information presented in @xcite has been of great benefit to past studies , a more extensive data set , namely the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas - @xcite ) is now available .",
    "this data set provides comprehensive coverage along the full extent of the gss , as well as other structures in the vicinity , notably stream c and stream d @xcite .",
    "stream c is determined in that study to be a little brighter and substantially more metal rich than stream d. both streams exhibit distinct properties to the gss and hence must be considered separate structures , despite their apparent intersection with the gss on the sky . given the reliance of the aforementioned orbital studies on high quality distance and metallicity information , and given the prominent role played by stellar streams as diagnostic tools within the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation , it is highly advantageous to further constrain the distance and metallicity as a function of position along the stream using these data .",
    "the following sections hence outline the results of a new tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) algorithm as applied to subfields lining the gss and streams c and d. in section  2 , we provide a description of this method , in  3 we present the results of this study and in  4 and  5 we conclude with a discussion and summary respectively .",
    "note that this publication forms part of a series focusing on key substructure identified in the m31 outer halo .",

    "obtaining distances at closely spaced intervals along the giant stellar stream has proven quite challenging , owing largely to the contrast of the stream with respect to the surrounding m31 halo stars , and also due to the wide spread in metallicities . whilst the trgb method presented in @xcite and @xcite provided the basis for the method we employ here",
    ", that method has its niche in application to metal poor populations with a low spread in metallicities .",
    "hence for the gss , a significant adaptation was necessary , as now discussed .    in the earlier method",
    ", the luminosity function of the object in question was modeled using a truncated power law to represent the contribution from the object s red giant branch ( rgb ) , as per eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 represents the probability of finding a star at a given magnitude , @xmath27 is the ( cfht ) @xmath28-band magnitude of the star in question , @xmath29 is the trgb magnitude and @xmath30 is the slope of the power law . to this power law was then added a polynomial fit to the luminosity function of a nearby field chosen to represent the contamination from non - object stars in the object field .",
    "this contamination component was then scaled relative to the object rgb component based on a comparison of the stellar density between the object and contamination fields . as this method",
    "is solely concerned with the @xmath28-band magnitude of a star , and does not take into account its color information , it is effectively a one - dimensional method in two - dimensional color - magnitude space .",
    "this means that the only metallicity information incorporated into the fit is that from the color - cut imposed on the stars beforehand .",
    "the dependence of the cfht @xmath28-band trgb magnitude on metallicity becomes an important consideration however for metallicities greater than @xmath31 ( see for example fig",
    ". 6 of @xcite for the sdss @xmath28-band which is comparable ) . for this reason",
    ", we have developed a two - dimensional approach to identifying the trgb , one that incorporates a star s position in both color and magnitude space into the fitted model .",
    "for our two - dimensional model of the object rgb , we draw our basis from the isochrones provided in the dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite .",
    "therein are provided the necessary theoretical isochrones for the cfht @xmath28-band and @xmath32-band photometry provided by the pandas survey . within this database , isochrones are provided for a range of ages ( @xmath33 gyr ) , metallicities ( @xmath34 \\le 0.5 $ ] ) , helium abundances @xmath35 and alpha - enhancement @xmath36 $ ] values . for use with our algorithm ,",
    "we have generated a large set of @xmath37 isochrones in cfht @xmath28 vs @xmath38 space with @xmath22 = -2.50 , -2.45 , ... , 0.50 $ ] for each of @xmath39 gyr where @xmath40 gyr and @xmath41 gyr where @xmath42 gyr .",
    "all isochrones are generated with @xmath43 and @xmath36 = 0.00 $ ] .",
    "the model rgb can then be constructed via an interpolation of the isochrone grid corresponding to a given age .    using the set of dartmouth isochrones",
    "as generated for any given age , we essentially have a field of points in 2d ( i.e. those corresponding to the color and magnitude of a particular mass value within a given isochrone ) which form the framework of our model .",
    "each of these points can then be scaled relative to each other point , thus adding a third dimension which represents the model height or density at that location in the cmd .",
    "this model height can then be manipulated by a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm by altering a number of parameters , as outlined below . the model surface in between the resulting points is then interpolated by taking adjacent sets of 3 points and fitting a triangular plane segment between them .",
    "in order to manipulate the model height at each point in color - magnitude space , 3 parameters are implemented .",
    "the first is the slope of a power law _ a _ applied as a function of _ i_-band magnitude , as per eq [ eq1 ] .",
    "the second and third denote the centre and width of a gaussian weighting distribution applied as a function of metallicity ( i.e. a function of both colour and magnitude ) .",
    "the slope parameter _ a _ is a convenient , if crude measure for accounting for the increase in the stellar population as you move faint - ward from the trgb .",
    "significant time was invested in an effort to devise a more sophisticated approach taking into account the specific tracks of the isochrones , but the simplest approach of applying the slope directly as a function of _ i_-band magnitude remained the most effective and hence was used for all fits presented in this contribution .",
    "the gaussian distribution applied as a function of metallicity is used to weight each isochrone based on the number of object stars lying along that isochrone .",
    "each isochrone is hence given some constant height along all its constituent masses , with the slope parameter being used to discriminate between model heights within a single isochrone .",
    "the isochrones are weighted as follows : @xmath44_{iso } - [ fe / h]_0)^2}{2 \\times w_{rgb}^2 } \\right )       \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the weight applied to isochrone @xmath46 , @xmath22_0 $ ] is the central metallicity of the population , @xmath22_{iso}$ ] is the metallicity of the isochrone being weighted , and @xmath47 is the one sigma spread in the metallicity of the isochrones , which we shall refer to as the rgb width .",
    "we note that the metallicity distribution function can be far from gaussian , but nevertheless hold that this simplified model is both efficient and adequate in its simplicity .",
    "in particular , the distribution for the general m31 spheroid is far from gaussian and hence this component is essentially folded into the normalization of the field contamination .",
    "our fitted streams are in contrast represented by far more gaussian distribution functions , and hence are fitted as the signal component by our algorithm .    with the model cmd for the object constructed in the aforementioned fashion",
    ", we now require the addition of a contamination model component . here",
    "we use the pandas contamination models as provided in @xcite .",
    "essentially they provide a measure of the intensity of the integrated milky way contamination in any given pixel in the pandas survey .",
    "likewise , they allow the user to generate a model contamination cmd for any pixel in the survey . whilst it is possible to derive a measure of the object - to - contamination ratio directly from these models ,",
    "we find that given the low contrast in many of the gss subfields , it is preferable to fit this ratio as a free parameter determined by the mcmc process .",
    "to generate our mcmc chains , we employ the metropolis - hastings algorithm . in summary",
    ", we determine the likelihood @xmath48 of the model for a given set of parameters and compare with the likelihood of the most recent set of parameters in the chain @xmath49 .",
    "we then calculate the metropolis ratio @xmath50 :    @xmath51    and accept the proposed parameter set as the next in the chain if a new , uniform random deviate drawn from the interval @xmath52 $ ] is less than or equal to @xmath50 . in order to step through the parameter space ,",
    "we choose a fixed step size for each parameter that is large enough to traverse the whole probability space yet small enough to sample small features at a suitably high resolution .",
    "the new parameters are drawn from gaussian distributions centered on the most recent accepted values in the chain , and with their width set equal to the step size . upon the completion of the mcmc run , the chains",
    "are then inspected to insure that they are well mixed .",
    "thus , we now have everything we need for our model cmd . at each iteration of the mcmc",
    ", we generate a model of the gss red giant branch by using a grid of isochrones and manipulating their relative strengths using free parameters representing the central metallicity and rgb width of the stellar population combined with a parameter representing the slope in density as a function of _ i_-band magnitude .",
    "we then slide this model component over the top of the contamination model component , with their respective ratio set via a fourth free parameter .",
    "we restrict the fitted magnitude range to @xmath53 to provide adequate coverage of the range of distances we expect to encounter whilst retaining a relatively narrow , more easily simulated band across the cmd .",
    "the final fitted parameter then is the trgb magnitude itself , which determines how far along the _",
    "i_-band axis to slide the isochrone grid from it s default position at 10 pc ( i.e. the isochrones are initially set to their absolute _",
    "i_-band magnitudes ) .",
    "thus it is actually the distance modulus of the population that we measure directly , since there is no fixed trgb magnitude , but rather it is variable in color as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fit2gss3 ] . for the sake of presenting a specific trgb magnitude ( as all trgb investigations",
    "traditionally have done ) , we define a reference trgb apparent magnitude ( @xmath29 ) , derived from the distance modulus assuming a fixed absolute magnitude of the trgb ( @xmath54 ) of @xmath55 .",
    "this is a good approximation to the roughly constant value of @xmath54 for intermediate to old , metal poor populations for which the trgb standard candle has traditionally been used ( @xmath22 \\le -1 $ ] , see fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) and allows for direct comparison with other publications in this series . clearly for the present study",
    "we are fitting populations that are often more metal rich than this , but it must be stressed that this adopted value is purely cosmetic with no bearing on the derived distance or any other determined parameter .",
    "the age of the isochrone grid is fixed at an appropriate value determined from the literature ( 9 gyr in the case of the gss , 9.5 gyr for streams c and d and general spheroid fields and 7.5 gyr for the m31 disk - all rounded from the values given in @xcite ) .",
    "initial tests of the algorithm with the population age added as a sixth free mcmc parameter revealed that the choice of age had no effect on the location of the parameter probability peaks returned by the mcmc , but only on their relative strengths .",
    "it was hence decided more efficient to fix the age at a suitable value for the target population , as determined from the literature .    as an additional consideration",
    ", the model rgb is further convolved with a 2d gaussian kernel to simulate the blurring effects of the photometric uncertainties .",
    "we assume a photometric uncertainty of 0.015 magnitudes for both @xmath28 and @xmath32 bands and set the dimensions of the gaussian kernel accordingly .",
    "we note that whilst in the fitted range the photometric uncertainty lies in the range 0.005 to 0.025 , the tip will generally be located in the range @xmath56 for the structures studied in this contribution , making the assumed uncertainty value the most suitable .",
    "any issues of photometric blending must be resolved by excising any regions above some suitable density threshold , although such issues have only been observed at the centers of the densest structures in the pandas survey and were not an issue for this study .",
    "similarly , care must be taken to insure that data incompleteness does not effect the fitted sample of stars , which was achieved in the present study by restricting the magnitude range of selected stars .",
    "finally , at the conclusion of the mcmc run , a probability distribution function ( pdf ) in each free parameter is obtained by marginalizing over the other parameters . as an example , the distance pdf for the gss3 subfield , which was obtained via sampling from the pdf in the reference trgb magnitude , is presented in fig .",
    "[ gss3_distance_pdf ] .",
    "the distance probability distribution is derived from that in the reference trgb magnitude using the following equation : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the distance in parsecs ; @xmath29 is the reference trgb apparent magnitude , sampled from the pdf in this parameter produced by the mcmc ; @xmath59 is the extinction in magnitudes for the center of the field , as sampled from a gaussian with a central value determined from the schlegel extinction maps @xcite and a width equal to 10 % of the central value ; and @xmath54 is the absolute magnitude of the trgb .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath54 is a systematic quantity and we thus omit it from our calculations since we are primarily concerned in relative distances between subfields as opposed to absolute distances from earth .",
    "we hence ignore any uncertainty in the absolute magnitude of the tip and note that all distances will have a systematic offset of not more than @xmath18 kpc ( assuming an uncertainty of approximately @xmath60 magnitudes ) .",
    "all mcmc runs used for the results presented in this contribution were of @xmath61 iterations whilst the distance distributions are generated using @xmath62 samples of the @xmath29 and @xmath59 distributions .    in conjunction with the results we present in the following section , we also provide an appendix to inform the interested reader as to any degeneracy between the key parameters of tip magnitude , metallicity and the rgb width . in appendix",
    "a , we present contour plots illustrating the covariance between the tip magnitude and the metallicity for the gss and streams c and d. in appendix b we present similar plots for the covariance between metallicity and rgb width for the same structures . in",
    "appendix c we present both types of plot for our halo comparison fields which shall be referred to in the next section .",
    "it can be seen from these plots that any covariance between parameters is only minor .",
    "these plots are also extremely useful for visualizing the true probability space of the key parameters for each field , and provide an informative compliment to the results plotted in figs .",
    "[ gssdist ] through [ stream_d_parameters ] .",
    "the results we present in this section pertain to a number of separate structures . a field map illustrating the gss subfields and andromeda i exclusion zone as well as the fields utilized by @xcite , is presented in fig . [ fieldmaps ] .",
    "the subfield placements along stream c and stream d are also indicated in this figure .",
    "our principal focus is the giant stellar stream , which is contained within our field labeled ` gss ' .",
    "fields c and d enclose streams c and d respectively ; and fields h1 through h3 are separate halo fields adjacent to our target fields which sample the general m31 spheroid for comparison purposes .    as discussed in  [ method ] , for each subfield we obtain estimates of the heliocentric distance , the metallicity [ @xmath63 and the rgb width ( @xmath47 ) , as well as the contamination fraction from milky way stars ( @xmath64 ) . these are quantified in tables [ par_table1 ] and [ par_table2 ] , as are the distance modulus , extinction ( @xmath65 ) and m31 distance for each subfield .",
    "distances along the gss ( both heliocentric and m31-centric ) are plotted as a function of their m31-centric tangent plane coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 in figure [ gssdist ] .",
    "metallicities and rgb widths for the gss are plotted as a function of @xmath66 and @xmath67 in figure [ gssmet ] .",
    "figures [ stream_c_parameters ] and [ stream_d_parameters ] present the distances ( heliocentric and m31-centric ) , metallicities and rgb widths for stream c and stream d respectively . all data points are plotted together with their one - sigma ( @xmath68 ) uncertainties .",
    "note that for the gss , an overlapping system of fields was implemented such that a given field gss@xmath69 contains the stars from the lower half of field gss@xmath70 and the upper half of field gss@xmath71 .",
    "for this reason , data points are shown in between the numbered fields in figure [ gssdist ] and figure [ gssmet ] . in each of the figures [ gssdist ] through [ stream_d_parameters ] , basis splines",
    "are over plotted on each structure to aid the eye - they are not intended as a fit to the data .",
    "the splines are simply a smoothing function weighted by the errors in each data point - they are not constrained to pass through any specific data point .",
    "each combination of parameters is smoothed separately and smoothing does not take into account the full three dimensions ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath72parameter@xmath73 ) .",
    "cubic splines are used for our gss measurements whilst quadratic splines are used for all other measurements .    for",
    "the derivation of the m31 distance for each subfield , a new distance to m31 of @xmath74 kpc was determined via our new method , by fitting to stars within an elliptical annulus centered on m31 and defined by inner and outer ellipses with ellipticities of @xmath75 , position angles of @xmath76 and semi - major axes of @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fieldmaps ] ) .",
    "this distance is a little smaller than the @xmath79 kpc determined by the 1d predecessor of our current method @xcite and larger than the @xmath80 kpc determined from cepheid variables @xcite or the @xmath81 kpc determined from eclipsing binaries @xcite but nevertheless well within the uncertainties of each of these measurements .",
    "it is immediately clear , both from the large error bars in figures [ gssdist ] through [ stream_d_parameters ] and in particular from the last column ( @xmath64 ) of tables [ par_table1 ] and [ par_table2 ] , that our parameter estimates for most subfields are derived from heavily contaminated structures .",
    "nevertheless , on closer inspection , much can be inferred from the estimates returned by our algorithm .",
    "our results support the same general distance gradient reported by @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ gssdist ] , although we note a slightly greater increase in distance as a function of angular separation from m31 .",
    "we also find no evidence of the sudden distance increase between fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 of that study , and importantly , we note that the stream appears to emerge from a small distance in front of the m31 disk center",
    ". it should be noted that the results reported in @xcite determine distance shifts of each field with respect to field @xmath83 - taken as the m31 distance - whereas our estimates are independent of any inter - field correlations .",
    "our data is also the product of a different imager to that used in this earlier study and of a different photometric calibration .",
    "we also stress that the technique used in the earlier contribution did not take metallicity changes into account on a field - by - field basis .",
    "the mid gss fields are in fact slightly more metal rich than the inner most fields ( see fig .",
    "[ gssmet ] ) which would yield inflated distance estimates for those fields .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ gssdist ] that our distance estimates appear to depart markedly from the general trend between subfields gss4 and gss5.5 as well as between gss6 and gss7.5 .",
    "these subfields coincide with the intersection ( on the sky ) between the gss and streams d and c respectively . with the exception of subfield gss4.5 ,",
    "each of these anomalous subfields contain parameter probability distributions that are double peaked , with the second peak more in keeping with the gss trend and thus presumably attributable to the gss . in the case of subfield gss5",
    ", stream d would appear to be consistent with the additional peak in so far as distance is concerned , but the same can not be said for either the metallicity or the rgb width . in the case of subfields gss6.5 and gss7 , the additional peak is roughly consistent with the secondary peak derived for subfield c3 in terms of distance and rgb width but the metallicity is different . for all fields where a restriction on the trgb probability distribution proved informative ( namely subfields gss5 , gss6.5 , gss7 , gss8.5 and gss9 ) ,",
    "parameter estimates are provided for both the restricted and unrestricted case .",
    "the fields are denoted in the restricted case with the symbol @xmath84@xmath85 in table [ par_table1 ] and in appendix a and appendix b , whilst @xmath84 is used in the unrestricted case .",
    "fields denoted @xmath84@xmath85 will be represented as black triangle symbols in figs [ gssdist ] and [ gssmet ] whilst those denoted @xmath84 will be represented as red square symbols .",
    "we note that even when the gss subfield distances are determined from the full parameter distributions , they remain in general keeping with the trend when the full uncertainties are considered .    moving on to the outer most portion of the gss , it is interesting to observe that the distance seems to plateau and even diminish beyond the brightest portion of the stream covered in @xcite , although caution must be exercised with inferences made from the outermost subfields , due to the extremely low signal available .    for streams c and d ,",
    "we find average distances of @xmath86 kpc and @xmath87 kpc respectively .",
    "we are unable to determine any reliable distance gradient along either of these structures .",
    "in addition to streams c and d , consideration had been given to the possibility of an arching segment of the gss , extending outward from subfields gss8 , gss9 and gss10 and falling back onto the m31 disk in the vicinity of subfields c4 and d4/ d5 . despite the conceivable existence of such a feature based on visual inspection of stellar density plots ,",
    "no distinct population could be reliably determined in any of the fitted parameters . if such a continuation of the gss exists , it is heavily contaminated by the much brighter stream c and stream d and beyond the reach of our method in its present form .",
    "when we examine the metallicity and rgb width estimates returned by our algorithm ( see figure [ gssmet ] ) , we observe an unusual trend as we move out along the main part of the gss .",
    "closest to the m31 disk , the stream is found to be moderately metal poor , with metallicities in the range @xmath88 > -0.8 $ ] whilst midway along the stream we find more metal rich stars with @xmath22 > -0.5 $ ] . then , as we move out still further , the metallicity diminishes again , falling below the levels in the inner part of the stream with @xmath22 \\approx -1 $ ] at the furthest reaches in subfield gss10 .",
    "a similar trend is observed for the rgb width .",
    "this would suggest that the range of metallicities present is relatively small in the inner part of the stream , whilst increasing significantly as we move toward the middle part of the stream . once again , in the outer most parts of the stream , we observe a return to lower values , although not to the same degree as we observed for the metallicity .",
    "once again , we must stress however that the contamination fraction is exceedingly high in the outermost subfields and thus the metallicity and rgb width estimates for these subfields should be treated with caution .",
    "we find streams c and d to be consistently more metal poor than the gss , with average metallicities of @xmath89 dex and @xmath90 dex respectively .",
    "they are also generally less diverse in terms of the range of metallicities present .",
    "when we compare our halo fields to our gss and stream c and d fields , we find a clear indication that we are indeed picking up the signal of the intended structures .",
    "when we examine the contour plots in appendix c , we find distributions that are markedly different from those of our target structures presented in appendices a and b. these fields were carefully chosen to be of comparable size to our target fields , and to traverse the approximate m31 halo radii spanned by our target structures .",
    "the lack of any clear structure to fit to in fields h1 and h2 is clear from the breadth of the distributions in all parameters , whereas clearly such poor parameter constraints are not observed for any of our target fields .",
    "likewise , we find little correlation between the location of the distribution maxima .",
    "halo field h3 is somewhat different to fields h1 and h2 in that it is expected to be heavily contaminated by the m31 disk .",
    "more overlap in the distributions is found between the h3 field and our target fields ( the stream d subfields for instance ) , particularly in tip magnitude and metallicity , but the signal - to - noise ratio is much higher for our inner fields , suggesting that any correlations are real and not merely the result of contamination .",
    "we should also note that we expect any parameter gradients across the halo to be diffuse and unsuited to our method which works most favorably with sharply defined structure boundaries along the line of sight .",
    "this is indeed exemplified by the plots in appendix c.",
    "the key findings of our method lie in the spatially resolved metallicities and distances along the main inner - halo structures around m31 .",
    "our metallicity measurements are consistent with all prior published measurements . whilst these measurements utilize data from a variety of instruments , we note that our method was not tuned to be consistent with any of these prior results .",
    "the initial discovery of the gss by @xcite in the issac newton telescope ( int ) survey measured a metallicity of slightly higher than @xmath22=-0.71 $ ] at a position consistent with our innermost gss subfields ( gss1 to gss3 ) . of the 16 hubble space telescope ( hst )",

    "further out , at a location consistent with our gss subfield gss4 , keck deimos spectra analyzed by @xcite gave a higher mean metallicity measurement of @xmath22=-0.51 $ ] , matching our findings .",

    "@xcite also found the inner halo streams ( including streams c and d ) to be dominant in the metallicity range @xmath22=-1.7 $ ] to @xmath92 , where our results for stream d and one subfield of stream c are situated , although there are also signs of a significant population of stream c members in the range @xmath22=-1.1 $ ] to @xmath93 , where the bulk of our stream c results lie .",
    "this lends support to the suggestion by @xcite that there are two , potentially completely separate populations that make up stream c. these populations are found separable by their velocity measurements , and also by their metallicities of @xmath22=-1.3 $ ] and @xmath10 in the aforesaid publication , which match our findings for subfield c2 , and the rest of stream c respectively .",
    "indeed , @xcite also find evidence of two populations in stream c , separable into a more metal rich component ( @xmath22_{mean } = -0.79 \\pm 0.12 $ ] dex ) and metal poor component ( @xmath22_{mean } = -1.31 \\pm 0.18 $ ] dex ) .",
    "we caution however that our detection of two populations is tentative and independent velocity measurements for our field locations are warranted if a clear distinction is to be confirmed .",
    "@xcite additionally measured the metallicity of stream d to be @xmath22=-1.1\\pm 0.3 $ ] , in good agreement with our results .",
    "a key finding of this paper is the extraordinary extent of the gss to the south - east , reaching a full degree further away from m31 in projection than previously measured , at a @xmath94 degree separation for subfield gss10 .",
    "@xcite was able to find a model for the gss which sufficiently matched observations of some of the inner structures , however the low velocity dispersions , physical thickness and narrow metallicity ranges of streams c and d found by @xcite suggest that a single accretion event is unlikely to be sufficient to form both of these structures as well as the gss .",
    "one possible scenario that might explain the difference in metallicity between streams c and d and the main gss structure is a spinning disk galaxy progenitor with a strong metallicity gradient following a radial plunging orbit into m31 resulting in the outer portion ending up on a counter orbit with a lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "although each new observation makes explanations such as this increasingly contrived .",
    "none of the current simulations of this system predict or include an extension of the gss as far out as we find it , or the existence of any arching segment to the gss ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the latest simulations of @xcite include distances for the main gss , which while consistent with the distances presented by @xcite , are also highly consistent with the distances presented here , particularly for the innermost and outermost portions of the gss .",
    "this suggests that finding a simulation consistent with our much more restrictive distance constraints for the gss may only require minor alterations .    whilst our method has been very successful fitting these structures , particularly considering the high levels of contamination in this region ( over 85 per cent for most subfields )",
    ", it is in some instances difficult to resolve all the populations , especially for the fainter structures .",
    "some additional information will be gleaned by running a full multi - population fit ( martin et al in prep ) , but to fully uncover the history of this system , we will need detailed simulations of the formation and evolution of the gss and associated structures .",
    "these simulations should take into account realistic gas physics , combined with next generation observations including wide field kinematic surveys .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ par_table2 ]",
    "we have presented the distances and metallicities for the major inner - halo streams of m31 using the highest quality data currently available .",
    "there is a great deal of overlap between many of these features , making clear measurements troublesome , however the new method we developed to fit populations to the data have allowed some details to be revealed .",
    "there is a clear need for a wide field kinematic survey of the stellar substructure within the halo of m31 , which combined with the superb pandas photometric data , would allow for a complete decomposition of these structures .",
    "this would bring a much greater understanding of the current and past accretion history of our nearest neighbour analogue , and would represent a great leap forward in galactic archaeology .",
    "the conclusion of this work then , is that the gss , stream c , and stream d , are in general extremely faint , and can not be completely separated using the currently available photometric data .",
    "our method however , allows for even the lowest contrast structures to be partially resolved into separate populations , providing both distance and metallicity probability distributions .",
    "these values will be invaluable for future simulations of the m31 system , placing much stronger constraints on the three dimensional present day positions of the major inner - halo structures . a full population fit based on this data , will lead to a deeper understanding , and will be the subject of a future contribution .",

    "<S> we are able to generate probability distributions in distance , metallicity and rgb width for a series of subfields spanning these structures . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we confirm a distance gradient of approximately 20 kpc per degree along a 6 degree extension of the giant stellar stream , with the farthest subfields from m31 lying @xmath0 120 kpc more distant than the inner - most subfields . </S>",
    "<S> further , we find a metallicity that steadily increases from @xmath1 dex to @xmath2 dex along the inner half of the stream before steadily dropping to a value of @xmath3 dex at the farthest reaches of our coverage . </S>",
    "<S> the rgb width is found to increase rapidly from @xmath4 dex to @xmath5 dex in the inner portion of the stream before plateauing and decreasing marginally in the outer subfields of the stream . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we estimate stream c to lie at a distance between @xmath6 and @xmath7 kpc and stream d between @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 kpc . we estimate the median metallicity of stream c to lie in the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 dex and a metallicity of @xmath12 dex for stream d. rgb widths for the two structures are estimated to lie in the range @xmath13 to @xmath14 dex and @xmath15 to @xmath16 dex respectively . in total , measurements are obtained for 19 subfields along the giant stellar stream , 4 along stream c , 5 along stream d and 3 general m31 spheroid fields for comparison . </S>",
