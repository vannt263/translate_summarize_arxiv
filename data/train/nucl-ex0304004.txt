    "photoproduction of mesons from light nuclei can serve two purposes : the investigation of the isospin structure of the electromagnetic excitation of nucleon resonances and the study of the meson - nucleon interaction via final state interaction effects . in principle , there are two possibilities to learn about the isospin structure of the photoexcitation amplitudes .",
    "coherent photoproduction from light nuclei may be used as an isospin filter , while photoproduction from bound nucleons in quasifree kinematics can be used to extract the neutron cross section . the small binding energy and the comparatively well understood nuclear structure single out the deuteron as exceptionally important target nucleus .",
    "however , as a cross check for nuclear effects , it is desirable to use also a nucleus with a different momentum distribution of the bound nucleons as target . in this respect",
    "@xmath5 is an extreme case due to the stoung bindung of the nucleus .    during the last few years we have intensively studied quasifree , and coherent @xmath0-photoproduction from the deuteron and from he - nuclei @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation of @xmath6 @xmath7 resonances involves two isospin components , the isoscalar and the isovector amplitudes .",
    "the complete determination of the amplitudes is possible from the measurement of @xmath0-photoproduction from the proton , the neutron and coherent photoproduction from the @xmath8 deuteron making use of :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the isoscalar and @xmath11 the isovector part of the helicity amplitude .",
    "it is of course clear that the extraction of the amplitudes from the cross sections requires a careful separation of the contributions from overlapping resonances and background terms like born terms or vector meson exchange .",
    "the situation is simplest close to threshold where only a few partial waves contribute . in this sense @xmath0-photoproduction in the threshold region",
    "is a special case , since the reaction is completely dominated by the excitation of the s@xmath4(1535 ) resonance .",
    "the experiments were done at the mainz mami accelerator with the taps - detector @xcite , experimental details can be found in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the extraction of the cross section ratio @xmath12 for the reaction on the neutron and the proton can be done with different experimental concepts , which have all been exploited .    *",
    "measurement of the inclusive @xmath13 reaction and comparison of the sum of fermi smeared proton cross section and fermi smeared ansatz for the neutron cross section to the inclusive nuclear cross section in pwia .",
    "variation of @xmath14 until agreement is achieved . * coincident measurement of @xmath0-mesons and recoil nucleons .",
    "extraction of the ratio of @xmath15 as function of the incident photon energy @xmath16 . * coincident measurement of @xmath0-mesons and recoil nucleons and reconstruction of the effective @xmath17 and effective incident photon energy @xmath18 from the final state kinematics , extraction of @xmath15 as function of @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20",
    "the total cross sections for the reactions @xmath13 and @xmath21 are summarized in fig . [",
    "fig : incl ] .",
    "the result of the pwia analysis in the s@xmath4(1535 ) range was a constant ratio @xmath15=2/3 @xcite .      only very close to the threshold the agreement between pwia and experimental results is not good ( see inserts in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot_incl ] ) .",
    "this is due to final state interaction ( fsi ) effects which have been understood in the meantime @xcite .",
    "note that the influence of the different nuclear momentum distributions is quite severe .",
    "the total cross sections from @xmath5 and from the deuteron are almost equal at an incident photon energy of 800 mev although twice the number of nucleons is involved in the he case .",
    "the good agreement of both data sets with impulse approximations using the same neutron proton ratio is therefore quite reassuring for the application of this method .",
    "the data for the neutron - proton cross section ratio obtained with the exclusive measurements for different targets are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratall ] and compared to model predictions . the observed rise of the cross section ratio to unity at the breakup threshold for incident photon energies , respectively at the free nucleon threshold for equivalent photon energies , is understood and a pure nuclear effect due to rescattering contributions etc . .",
    "the ratios are almost constant for higher incident photon energies and within their systematical uncertainties consistent with @xmath15=2/3 .",
    "a comparison of the energy dependence in the s@xmath4-range to model predictions clearly disfavors the interpretation of the resonance as a @xmath22 bound state @xcite .",
    "the results from the quasifree @xmath0-photoproduction in combination with coherent production from the deuteron @xcite have been interpreted as evidence for a dominant isovector contribution in the photoexcitation of the s@xmath4-resonance . since in addition",
    "the relevant multipole ( @xmath23 ) is a spin - flip multipole it is expected that the coherent reaction on @xmath5 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) is almost completely supressed , that it is weak on the deuteron ( @xmath24 , @xmath26 ) and not suppressed on @xmath27 ( @xmath6 , @xmath28 ) . in agreement with this expectation ,",
    "only upper limits could be derived for the coherent reaction on @xmath5 @xcite , while a small contribution was seen for the deuteron @xcite . however , in case of the deuteron the results for the quasifree and coherent reaction are not yet completely understood since the first seem to indicate an isoscalar admisture of @xmath29 9% while the latter require a larger isoscalar contribution of @xmath29 20% @xcite .",
    "the problem could be due to nuclear effects in the coherent reaction which are not yet well enough under control .",
    "additional information will be gained from the coherent reaction on @xmath27 , where due to the quantum numbers of the nucleus the dominant isovector , spin - flip part of the amplitude contributes .",
    "first preliminary results for the the cross section of this reaction indicate indeed a substantial contribution from the coherent part ( see fig .",
