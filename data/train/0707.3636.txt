    "our understanding of advanced stages of star formation ( t tauri and later phases ) has been significantly improved with the advent of infrared , submillimeter , and high - resolution optical observatories such as hst and spitzer . at the same time",
    "a great deal of uncertainty still remains regarding the earliest , so - called class 0 and class i , stages of the star formation process . in the conventional nomenclature , class 0 stars are the protostellar cloud cores in the very beginning of their collapse , while class i are the protostars embedded within an envelope of circumstellar material that is infalling , accumulating in the centrifugally supported disk , and being accreted by the protostars .    at present",
    ", our knowledge exhibits a significant gap when it comes to describing the actual buildup of the stellar mass , from @xmath4 in the class 0 phase to @xmath5 in the end of class i phase . from the observational point of view",
    "the major reasons for this are ( 1 ) the heavy obscuration provided by the increased densities in the central part of the infalling protostellar core and the molecular cloud as a whole and ( 2 ) the difficulty in deriving the spectra of the central objects , namely distinguishing between the intrinsic protostellar and accretion luminosities . at the same time",
    ", our ignorance concerns not only the history of _ mass _ accumulation by the protostars .",
    "thermodynamical state of the accumulated gas is also an important ingredient of the picture .",
    "stars that form out of material with high entropy , in particular that processed through the accretion shock , tend to have large sizes , while objects formed out of the lower entropy gas should be more compact . at the moment",
    "the uncertainty in the initial thermodynamical state of protostellar objects precludes us from getting a good handle on the evolutionary tracks of the fully assembled ( in terms of mass ) protostars in the first @xmath6 myrs after their formation . beyond about 10 myrs , when the initial conditions become largely forgotten , the evolution tracks calculated under different assumptions about the initial conditions typically converge ( baraffe 2002 ) . however , prior to this stage there are significant discrepancies between the results of different groups , and the uncertainty in the initial conditions for such calculations is the prime suspect for the difference .",
    "it is generally accepted that the conservation of the angular momentum in the collapsing protostellar cloud results in accumulation of the collapsed gas in a rotationally - supported disk in the cloud center .",
    "only a small fraction of the cloud mass has low enough angular momentum to collapse directly into the protostellar core .",
    "the majority of stellar mass is most likely accumulated by accretion from the disk .",
    "according to observations , class i stars acquire most of their mass on timescale of several @xmath7 yrs which implies that disks around these objects must exhibit time averaged mass accretion rates of @xmath8 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    "accretion luminosity released in processing such large mass flux through the disk exceeds the intrinsic luminosity of the protostar .",
    "this immediately raises an issue of the possible non - trivial radiative coupling between the protostar and its circumstellar disk .",
    "effects of disk accretion on structure of young stars have been investigated by mercer - smith ( 1984 ) , palla & stahler ( 1992 ) , siess & forestini ( 1996 ) , hartmann ( 1997 ) , siess ( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "some of these authors studies how the heat advected into the star with the freshly accreted material affects protostellar properties",
    ". however , none of these investigations looked at the effect of heat deposited at the stellar _ surface _ by radiation originating in the inner parts of the circumstellar disk , where most of the accretion energy is released ( see figure [ fig : scheme ] for a schematic representation ) . given that accretion luminosity may easily exceed the intrinsic stellar luminosity ( luminosity derived from gravitational contraction , cooling and , possibly , deuterium burning in stellar interior ) , omission of this effect may not be justified in many cases .",
    "in this paper we investigate stellar irradiation by the circumstellar disk and address the importance of this effect in determining the intrinsic luminosity of young stars .",
    "we calculate the spatial distribution of the disk flux on the stellar surface and determine when irradiation is important in  [ sect : t_dist ] .",
    "the effect of irradiation on stellar cooling is investigated locally in  [ sect : stellar_cool ] and globally in  [ sect : total_cooling ] . finally , in ",
    "[ sect : disc ] we discuss the applications of this study to some real objects and its possible limitations .",
    "we start by calculating the distribution on the stellar surface of the radiative flux @xmath9 produced by the disk .",
    "we consider an axisymmetric geometrically thin disk accreting onto a star with radius @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 .",
    "flux @xmath9 intercepted by the star is a function of @xmath12  the angle between the normal to the stellar surface and the normal to the disk ( coincident with the polar axis of the star , assuming that disk lies in the stellar equatorial plane ) .",
    "polar regions of the star are exposed to the radiation of only the distant , cool parts of the disk , while the equatorial regions have a direct view to the innermost parts of the disk where most of the energy is dissipated .",
    "one can easily show that a disk extending all the way to the stellar surface gives rise to irradiation flux @xmath13 given by ( adams & shu 1986 ; popham 1997 ) & & f_irr()=2 _ r_in^f_d(r)r dr + & & _ 0^_c d [ eq : irr_flux ] where @xmath14 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the energy radiated by the unit surface area of the disk per unit of time . in appendix",
    "a we demonstrate that this expression can be reduced to a one - dimensional integral which is easier to analyze than equation ( [ eq : irr_flux ] ) .    to find the explicit dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath12 one needs to know @xmath17 which is determined by the viscous dissipation in the disk .",
    "studies of steady - state thin accretion disks have generally found that f_d(r)=f(r ) [ eq : vis_dissip ] where @xmath18 is a mass accretion rate and the function @xmath19 , embodying the details of the disk emissivity near the stellar surface , behaves as @xmath20 when @xmath21 . with @xmath22 given by ( [ eq : vis_dissip ] )",
    "one finds f_irr()=g ( ) , [ eq : irr_flux_mod ] where the dimensionless function @xmath23 is given by equation ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "a standard disk with zero torque at the stellar surface ( situation appropriate for accretion onto black holes ) has ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath24 . the total viscous dissipation in such a disk is @xmath25 and the gas at the inner edge of the disk rotates at the local keplerian velocity .",
    "this is inappropriate in our case since the gas speed has to match the velocity of the stellar surface at @xmath26 ( for simplicity assumed to be zero in our case ) . as a result",
    "a boundary layer must form near the stellar surface in which the azimuthal velocity of the gas is lowered by the viscous torque from the local keplerian value to the stellar rotation speed .",
    "viscous dissipation dramatically increases gas temperature in this layer creating an additional source of radiative flux very close to the stellar surface .",
    "irradiation by the boundary layer emission boosts up the stellar surface temperature in a narrow belt at the equator ( with the thickness in @xmath12-direction comparable to the thickness of the boundary layer ) above that expected from the irradiation by the more distant parts of the disk , outside of the boundary layer .",
    "thus , the existence of the boundary layer significantly modifies disk structure and emissivity near the stellar surface ( popham 1993 ; popham & narayan 1995 ) complicating the calculation of @xmath19 .",
    "fortunately , it will be shown later in  [ sect : total_cooling ] that cooling of irradiated stars depends only weakly on the behavior of @xmath19 at @xmath27 and is thus relatively insensitive to the structure of the boundary layer . for the mass accretion rates considered in this work ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 )",
    "the geometric thickness of the boundary layer is rather small , @xmath28 r@xmath29 ( popham 1993 ) , so that the fraction of the stellar surface covered by the boundary layer and affected by the energy dissipation in it is rather small .",
    "for this reason we will further assume for simplicity that , larger than what can be provided by the change of the potential energy of disk material , but this inconsistency is not going to strongly affect our results . ] @xmath30 .",
    "in this case @xmath22 keeps increasing all the way to the stellar surface [ unlike the zero inner torque case in which @xmath31 thus roughly mimicking the contribution of the boundary layer to the disk flux .",
    "we plot the behavior of function @xmath23 in figure [ fig : irr_flux ] for both @xmath32 and @xmath24 .",
    "irrespective of the complications related to the existence of the boundary layer one can derive useful results for @xmath13 in two asymptotic regimes . in particular , using equation ( [ eq:1d ] ) one finds that as @xmath33 f_irr ,  g , [ eq : t_pi_2 ] a result that is easy to understand since any point at the stellar equator receives disk radiation with uniform temperature corresponding to local disk flux @xmath34 from @xmath35 steradian and reemits it into @xmath36 steradian . in the other limit of",

    "this asymptotic behavior is insensitive to the details of the disk emissivity at @xmath27 since polar regions are irradiated only by parts of the disk at @xmath21 where @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote @xmath3 and @xmath41 the temperature and luminosity which a star with mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath10 would have in the absence of irradiation ( @xmath42 is a stephan - boltzmann constant ) . to characterize the importance of irradiation we introduce _ irradiation parameter _",

    "young stars , brown dwarfs and giant planets are fully convective objects .",
    "it is well known ( kippenhahn & weigert 1994 ) that many characteristics of fully convective objects such as their luminosity and effective temperature are determined mainly by the properties ( opacity behavior , ratio of specific heats of the gas ) of their outermost , near - photospheric layers and are rather insensitive to the processes occurring in the convective interior . given that irradiation changes the boundary conditions on the surface of accreting fully convective object we may also expect that it should affect the luminosity of such an object ( arras & bildsten 2006 ) .",
    "intense heating some parts of the stellar surface suppresses convection in the subsurface layers and gives rise to a convectively stable radiative zone sandwiched between the photosphere and convective interior , see figure [ fig : scheme ] for illustration .",
    "appearance of this zone is analogous to the formation of a roughly isothermal radiative layer in the outer parts of the close - in extrasolar giant planets caused by the intense radiation of their parent stars ( guillot 1996 ; burrows 2000 ) .",

    "the radiative boundary condition ( [ eq : tboundary ] ) coupled with ( [ eq : balance ] ) is appropriate here because most of the stellar surface is not obscured by the accreting gas and is free to radiate energy into space .",
    "in general one must solve equation ( [ eq : rad_tran ] ) together with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in two dimensions  @xmath76 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , under the circumstances clarified in  [ sect:1d_validity ] the @xmath76-component of the radiative flux @xmath77 is much larger than its @xmath12-component @xmath78 , so that the latitudinal transport of energy can be neglected .",

    "this is the limit that we will focus on in this work .",
    "because of the thinness of the radiative zone , @xmath76 varies only weakly through the radiative zone so that one can neglect the divergence of the radial component of @xmath77 , thereby reducing equation ( [ eq : rad_tran ] ) to simply @xmath80 . with these simplifications equation ( [ eq : rad_tran ] )",

    "are calculated neglecting any additional heating that can be produced near the equator by the boundary layer dissipation .",
    "we will address this point in more detail in ",
    "[ sect : complications ] .",
    "luminosity suppression by disk irradiation is one of the most important results of this work .",
    "analogous phenomenon has been previously found in studies of extrasolar giant planets in short - period orbits , where stellar irradiation is quite severe ( guillot 1996 ; burrows 2000 ) . in that case irradiation",
    "affects only one side of the plant which always faces the star . some heat from the day side",
    "gets redistributed to the night side by atmospheric circulation ( menou 2003 ; dobbs - dixon & lin 2007 ) which should complicate the calculation of the photospheric boundary conditions across the whole planetary surface . in our case irradiation",
    "is azimuthally symmetric which makes our calculation more robust .",
    "analogous to the case of extrasolar giant planets we expect that luminosity suppression by irradiation would tend to retain heat inside the star and increase stellar radius above the value found in the absence of irradiation ( baraffe 2003 ) . whether this radius increase is significant will be investigated in future work .",
    "luminosity suppression may have some effect on the strength of the magnetic field that is generated by dynamo action in the convective interior of the star .",
    "since in irradiated case convective eddies transport smaller energy flux to the stellar surface than in the case of an isolated star the speed of convective motions is expected to be smaller .",
    "this results in a less vigorous dynamo action and likely weaker magnetic field generated inside the star .",
    "formation of an optically thick radiative zone near the stellar surface in irradiated regions is another result of this work which has important implications .",
    "as the star grows the hot gas in the vicinity of the boundary layer where disk meets the star gets advected into the convective interior thereby raising stellar entropy .",
    "this provides another way of slowing down stellar contraction , in addition to the luminosity suppression discussed above .",
    "hartmann ( 1997 ) argued that impact of the heat advection on stellar structure is not significant as long as the temperature of advected gas is much smaller than the central temperature of the star . in the irradiated case",
    "it is the properties of the external radiative zone that determine the temperature of the gas at the convective - radiative boundary , and thus the amount of thermal energy advected into the stellar interior . indeed",
    ", hot gas sinking through the radiative zone will lose a significant fraction of its thermal energy by radiative diffusion in the latitudinal direction , so that the temperature at the convective - radiative boundary is likely to be lower than in the center of the boundary layer .",
    "it is important to build the detailed 2d model of the radiative transport in the vicinity of the boundary layer to quantify this effect and to verify the significance of heat advection ( see also  [ sect:1d_validity ] ) .",
    "presence of the radiative zone may also affect atmospheric opacity in accreting brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "accreted gas brings in significant amount of dust into the object s atmosphere ( dust can also form out of the gas phase under low - temperature conditions ) which changes @xmath70 and radiative properties of the star ( chabrier 2000 ) . however , if the object is fully convective all the way to its photosphere , vertical fluid motions quickly advect dust grains into the hot interior where grains get easily destroyed .",
    "this is not the case in irradiated regions of accreting objects since dust grains can hover in the radiative zone for a long time , as long as their gravitational settling is not too fast . of course",
    ", for grains to exist in the outer radiative layer in the first place @xmath182 must be lower than the sublimation temperature of dust material , which may be possible only in accreting brown dwarfs and giant planets .",
    "we expect that in the case of young stars it would be very difficult to obtain a direct observational confirmation of the luminosity suppression by irradiation .",
    "the major reason for this is that @xmath166 starts to deviate from unity only when @xmath18 and , correspondingly , accretion luminosity are very large . at this stage",
    "the luminosity of a star+disk system is completely dominated by the direct emission from the disk and the disk flux intercepted and re - radiated by the stellar surface .",
    "intrinsic stellar luminosity provides negligible contribution which would be almost impossible to distinguish .",
    "besides , forming protostar should still be enshrouded in the dense veil of the residual gas collapsing onto the circumstellar disk .",
    "reprocessing of star+disk emission in this infalling envelope would complicate things even more .",
    "another potential way of detecting the luminosity suppression is indirect , through its effect on the stellar radius and luminosity as the star emerges as almost fully formed class i object in the end of active accretion phase .",
    "effects of disk accretion in star formation have been previously investigated by a number of authors .",
    "adams & shu ( 1986 ) and popham ( 1997 ) have calculated the amount of energy which is emitted by the disk and is intercepted by the star . unlike us these authors were not primarily concerned in the details of the distribution of irradiation flux over the stellar surface .",
    "this is a crucial point of our study allowing us to identify the two different regimes of stellar cooling ",
    "high- and low - latitude .",
    "mercer - smith ( 1984 ) were the first to explore the effect of disk accretion on the stellar structure .",
    "they handled disk accretion by specifying mass addition rate and accretion luminosity as external boundary conditions .",
    "they find that the stars formed by disk accretion have _ larger _ radii than nonaccreting stars of the same mass .",
    "as mentioned in hartmann ( 1997 ) this outcome most likely results from allowing the accreted material to have very high entropy which leads to stellar swelling , see prialnik & livio ( 1985 ) .",
    "this approximation is unlikely to be valid in reality since disk material joining the stellar surface should have enough time to radiate most of its thermal energy before being fully incorporated into the star .",
    "palla & stahler ( 1992 ) and hartmann ( 1997 ) in their studies of intermediate- and low - mass stars allowed the accreted material to have low entropy .",
    "they found that accretion _",
    "reduces _ stellar size compared to the non - accreting case since in this case the addition of mass leads only to the increase of gravitational energy of the star and is not accompanied by the increase of thermal energy .",
    "all these studies have either ignored irradiation of star by the disk or accounted for it only in the averaged sense which may not be acceptable as our study demonstrates . to get a complete picture of protostellar evolution one needs to include the luminosity suppression by disk irradiation into account .",
    "such calculation must necessarily allow for the spatial distribution of irradiation flux on the stellar surface since only in this way a proper estimate of the luminosity suppression can be obtained .      here",
    "we apply our results to different classes of fully convective objects which may accrete through the disk at high @xmath18 . in doing our estimates , which require the knowledge of @xmath10 and @xmath3",
    ", we use the radii and photospheric temperatures of corresponding objects determined in the absence of irradiation and mass inflow by accretion as proxies for @xmath10 and @xmath3 that these objects would have if irradiation and accretion were properly accounted for .",
    "needless to say , a truly accurate estimate of the effect of irradiation can be obtained only if @xmath10 and @xmath3 are calculated self - consistently accounting for the effects of accretion and irradiation .",
    "young low - mass stars transitioning from class 0 to class i phase are fully convective and should be assembled by mass accretion from a circumstellar disk within several @xmath7 yrs .",
    "this implies very high accretion rate and we adopt @xmath183 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 for a simple estimate .",
    "an isolated @xmath184 m@xmath1 star at an age of @xmath7 yrs has a radius @xmath185 r@xmath1 and effective temperature @xmath186 k ( siess 2000 ) .",
    "these parameters yield @xmath187 and @xmath188 k , although the latter is likely to be higher because of the boundary layer dissipation . at this @xmath43 cooling in the equatorial region",
    "is suppressed but the size of the polar caps is reduced only weakly : according to figure [ fig : irr_flux ] @xmath189 [ @xmath63 is given by an implicit relation @xmath190 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lambdas ] we present more general results for @xmath43 calculated for stars of different masses using stellar parameters from siess ( 2000 ) and assuming constant @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the accretion time ( assumed equal to the stellar age ) .",
    "one can see that the low - mass stars assembled within @xmath193 yrs generally have @xmath43 in the range of @xmath194 , agreeing with our simple estimate .",
    "since @xmath195 for @xmath111 k , young stars cool mainly through the polar regions and we find from figure [ fig : supp ] that stellar luminosity is reduced by irradiation only by about @xmath196 for @xmath197 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath18 is not constant but increases as @xmath11 grows one may expect values of @xmath43 larger by a factor of several . also , to calculate @xmath43 we have used parameters of isolated stars while stars assembled by disk accretion of the low - entropy material have smaller @xmath10 , leading to larger @xmath43 .",
    "all these factors may increase the importance of disk irradiation in determining @xmath148 of young accreting stars .",
    "a very interesting mode of star formation is possible in the accretion disks around the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the centers of galaxies ( illarionov & romanova 1988 ; goodman & tan 2004 ; nayakshin 2006 ) .",
    "it is currently known that our own galactic center harboring a smbh of mass @xmath198 m@xmath1 ( ghez 2005 ) contains a number of young ( @xmath199 myrs ) massive ( @xmath200 m@xmath1 ) stars that form two misaligned disks around the smbh ( paumard 2006 ) .",
    "one of the most likely scenarios for the origin of these stars is a fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk ( or disks ) followed by the growth of fragments to their present masses by gas accretion from the residual disk ( levin 2006 ; nayakshin 2006 ) . assuming that disk temperature is kept at the level of @xmath201 k by the radiation of nearby stars ( levin 2007 ) one finds that at @xmath202 pc from the smbh ( which is the typical dimension of the observed disks ) surface mass density of @xmath203 g @xmath204 is required for the disk to be toomre unstable .",
    "fragments formed as a result of instability at @xmath205 pc have a typical mass @xmath206 m@xmath1 ( approximately one jupiter mass ) where @xmath207 is a disk scale height . at formation",
    "the hill radius of such an object @xmath208 is already comparable to @xmath207 and as @xmath11 grows by accretion @xmath209 becomes larger than @xmath207 . as a result , accretion onto fragment proceeds through the _ sub - disk _ that forms within the fragment s hill sphere , presenting us with the setting investigated in this paper .",
    "rate at which gas flows into the fragment s hill sphere is the hill accretion rate is also typical for fu orioni objects .",
    "as demonstrated by popham ( 1993 ) in the high-@xmath18 regime the boundary layer is so thick that it covers a significant ( @xmath210 ) fraction of the stellar surface slowing down interior cooling .",

    "is affected by the time history of @xmath148 , irradiation should not be overlooked in studies of star formation in quasar disks .",
    "brown dwarf ( bd ) formation is likely to be a scaled down version of the low - mass star formation : one again expects a formation of a centrifugally supported disk around a fully convective object that grows by disk accretion .",

    "thus , young bds may be affected by the disk irradiation which may have consequences for their subsequent thermal evolution .",

    "the self - gravity of the core triggers an instability and leads to rapid gas accumulation ( mizuno 1980 ) .",
    "while the initial stages of this process can be adequately described in the spherically - symmetric approximation , the later epoch of unstable gas accretion must have distinctly non - spherical morphology .",

    "this results in @xmath253 and leads to a smaller drop of temperature in the outer convective parts of the star . on the other hand , superadiabaticity of convection in the outer layers of convective zone counteracts this effect to some extent .",

    ". a proper calculation of @xmath149 and @xmath166 must be able to account for the variation of @xmath88 with @xmath73 and @xmath249 inside the outer radiative zone .",
    "our analysis is affected to some extent by the presence of the boundary layer through which disk material joins the star .",
    "viscous dissipation in this layer heats accreting gas to very high temperature .",
    "since this energy release takes place very close to the stellar surface most of the heat is likely to leak out and not get carried into the star with the accreted gas .",
    "however , some residual heat may still be accreted .",
    "moreover , in addition to advective there could also be a radiative energy transfer from the boundary layer into the outer layers of the star ( popham 1997 ) .",
    "increase of @xmath249 in the external radiative zone driven by these processes acts to additionally slow down stellar cooling in the equatorial region , as equation ( [ eq : f_in ] ) demonstrates .",
    "thus , presence of the boundary layer reduces @xmath166 even more than our analysis predicts , and the results presented in figure [ fig : supp ] should be viewed as upper limits on @xmath166 .",
    "this effect is likely not very important for young stars which cool predominantly through their polar regions , largely unaffected by the additional heat deposition at the equator .",
    "however , in the case of young giant planets which lose fair amount of energy through the low - latitude part of the surface ( see  [ sect : planets ] ) the reduction of intrinsic flux in the equatorial region may produce quite noticeable decrease of @xmath166 compared to the idealized case considered in this work .",
    "when discussing the external radiative zone throughout this work we have been concerned only with the radiative energy transport . at the same time , it is well known that in the case of hot jupiters advective transport in the form of atmospheric jets and winds can be quite important in redistributing heat across the planetary surface ( menou 2003 ; dobbs - dixon & lin 2007 ) . in our azimuthally - symmetric setting only meridional atmospheric motions can lead to energy exchange between the hot equatorial and cold polar regions .",
    "fluid motions occurring on surfaces of constant effective potential ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) are unlikely to produce efficient equator - pole energy exchange ( compared to the radiative transfer ) because of rather fast rotation typical for objects formed by disk accretion .",
    "rotation forces angular momentum conservation and prevents significant fluid motions in @xmath12-direction , suppressing this mode of advective transport . on the other hand",
    ", rotation tends to promote meridional circulation within the radiative layer ( kippenhahn & weigert 1994 ) whose impact on the energy transport in the outer radiative zone should be investigated in more detail .",
    "finally , our basic assumption of direct mass accretion from the disk may be challenged if the growing star possesses magnetic field strong enough to disrupt accretion flow outside of @xmath10 ( knigl 1991 ; matt & pudritz 2005 ) . in this case gas",
    "is channeled by the magnetic field and is deposition onto the stellar surface at magnetic poles rather than at stellar equator .",
    "this completely changes the topology of accretion flow but the major conclusions about the effect on stellar cooling are likely to hold .",
    "indeed , the magnetically channeled gas travels towards the stellar surface at a good fraction of the free - fall velocity and at some point it must pass through the radiative shock , after which it accumulates at the top of the magnetospheric column of accreted material , as schematically indicated in figure [ fig : mag_pole ] .",
    "total energy release within the shock and magnetospheric column is comparable to that occurring if the accretion disk were extending all the way to the stellar surface .",
    "this hot column of accreted material illuminates the surface of the star leading to the same suppression of intrinsic stellar flux as we discussed in this work . in this case , however , irradiation is strongest near the magnetic poles while the magnetic equator is likely to be the coolest part of the stellar surface with the distance from the star . ] .",
    "calculation of stellar irradiation and integrated luminosity in this case would involve constructing a model for the magnetospheric column structure and its radiative properties .",
    "the impact of these details on the structure and evolution of young stars should be addressed by future work .",
    "luminosity of young stars actively accreting from the circumstellar disk can be significantly affected by the radiation which is produced in the inner parts of the disk and is intercepted by the stellar surface .",
    "we showed that if a star gains its mass via disk accretion on timescale of several @xmath7 yr then the radiative flux caused by viscous dissipation in the disk is more than sufficient to increase the surface temperature of the star above the photospheric temperature that an isolated star with the same mass and radius would have .",
    "irradiation by the disk is strongest in the equatorial regions and is almost negligible near the poles .",
    "an outer radiative zone of almost constant temperature forms above the fully convective interior in the strongly irradiated parts of the stellar surface .",
    "this leads to the local suppression of intrinsic energy flux escaping from the stellar interior .",
    "we have demonstrated that there are two distinct modes in which a fully convective object can cool : mainly through the cool high - latitude polar regions or predominantly through the low - latitude parts of the stellar surface .",
    "a particular regime of cooling in a given object is set by the opacity behavior and the adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath109 in the outer radiative zone .",
    "accreting young stars and brown dwarfs cool mainly through the polar regions while forming giant planets cool through the whole surface .",
    "integrated stellar luminosity in accreting case is suppressed compared to the case of an isolated object , by up to a factor of several in some classes of objects ( actively accreting brown dwarfs and planets , stars forming in gravitationally unstable disks in galactic nuclei ) .",
    "this leads to larger radii of irradiated objects and may affect the initial conditions which are used to calculate the evolution of the low - mass objects on timescales of @xmath227 myr after their formation .",
    "existence of external radiative zone may facilitate retention of dust in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and planets , and may affect the strength of magnetic field generated by internal dynamo in convective objects .",
    "some of the results obtained in this work may be applicable to accreting white dwarf and neutron star systems .",
