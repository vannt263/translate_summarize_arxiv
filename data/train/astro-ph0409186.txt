    "in recent years , the study of meteors received significant input primarily due to the campaigns to observe the leonid meteor storms ( jenniskens et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the new studies introduced novel observational methods as well as new analysis techniques . among those , the analysis of the light curves of visible meteors remains one of the more widespread techniques .",
    "the accepted picture regarding the light production by a meteor is that collisions between the ablated meteor atoms and atmospheric molecules and ions are responsible for this phenomenon . for small meteoroids ,",
    "the light production is proportional to the loss of kinetic energy by the body .",
    "as the meteoroid velocity remains almost constant throughout the luminous phase , it follows that the light production tracks the instantaneous mass loss by ablation .",
    "a general review of meteor light curve analysis was presented by hawkes et al .",
    "they discussed six improvements to traditional meteor light curve analysis in order to provide higher resolution and better information : use of generation iii image intensifier technology , digital recording techniques , digital image processing algorithms which separate the even and odd video fields , whole - image background subtraction , analysis of pixel - by - pixel high resolution meteor light curves , and utilization of coincidence and correlation techniques .",
    "however , they did not introduce novel analysis methods of the higher quality data .",
    "the classical light curve ( lc ) produced by a solid , compact , and non - fragmenting meteoroid should be smooth and exhibit its maximum luminosity near the end of the trail ( cook 1954 ) .",
    "this is the combination of the exponential increase in air density as the meteoroid penetrates into deeper atmospheric layers , and of the reduction in the surface area presented by the meteoroid to the airflow as the ablation proceeds .",
    "however , recent measurements indicate that this picture of single - body ablation may not be correct . in many cases ,",
    "faint meteors were shown to produce @xmath2symmetric lcs .    a basic question concerning the behavior of the light produced by ablating meteors is therefore whether this process involves at all stages a single object , or whether during the production of light the meteoroid disintegrates in a rather large number of grains ( the `` dustball '' model : hawkes & jones 1975 ) .",
    "this model assumes that the meteoroid is composed of numerous small grains with a high melting point temperature , held together by a low melting point glue .",
    "fisher et al .",
    "( 2000 ) followed hawkes & jones ( 1975 ) and suggested that most meteoroids are collections of hundreds to thousands of fundamental minute grains , at least some of which are released prior to the onset of intensive ablation .",
    "one would expect these grains , unless extremely uniform in physical properties , to become aerodynamically separated during atmospheric entry , and therefore to produce a `` wake '' , which is defined as some instantaneous meteor light production from an extended spatial region .",
    "fisher et al . presented theoretical results for wake production as a function of grain mass distribution , height of separation , zenith angle and velocity .",
    "koten & borovicka ( 2001 ) analyzed 234 meteor lcs , among which there were 110 leonids from the 1998 and 1999 showers .",
    "one of their goals was the identification of relations between the lc shapes and other parameters . among these , they included the leading and the trailing slopes of the lcs , defined as linear relations between the beginning of the lc and its maximum , and between the maximum and the terminal point of the lc .",
    "bellot rubio et al ( 2002 ) studied photographic light curves of relatively bright meteors with magnitudes in the range from + 2.5 to -5 , collected by jacchia et al .",
    "( 1967 ) with super schmidt observations , in order to derive the average density of meteors and to test whether the single - body theory of meteor evolution fits the observations better than that of continuous disintegration .",
    "velocities , decelerations and magnitudes were fitted simultaneously to synthetic light curves , and the ablation coefficient , the shape - density coefficient and the pre - atmospheric mass of each individual meteoroid were determined .",
    "bellot rubbio et al . could not confirm the large meteor density values determined from the quasi - continuous fragmentation models , essentially supporting the single - body ablation model .",
    "babadzhanov ( 2002 ) reached opposite conclusions , supporting the continuous fragmentation model , from an analysis of 111 photographic light curves of meteors .",
    "similar conclusions , that is a preference for continuous disintegration during re - entry of meteors , were reached by jiang & hu ( 2001 ) from an analysis of high spatial resolution meteor light curves obtained during the 1998 and 1999 leonid showers .",
    "light curves of leonid meteors collected in recent years were analyzed by murray et al .",
    "the meteors they concentrated on were fainter than those discussed by bellot rubbio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , of 6 - 8 mag , and the observations were performed with intensified ccd video cameras with fields of view from 16@xmath312@xmath4 to 40@xmath335@xmath4 .",
    "murray et al .",
    "concentrated on the modified _",
    "f _ parameters and used these to distinguish among differences in overall light curve shapes .",
    "the _ f _ parameter , to be explained below , ranged between 0.49 and 0.66 for individual annual showers ( where _ _ f__=0.5 is defined as a symmetrical curve , _",
    "_ f__@xmath50.5 an early skewed one , and _ _",
    "f__@xmath60.5 a late skewed curve ) .",
    "the findings indicate morphological differences between leonid meteoroids observed in different years , thus originating from different ejection epochs .",
    "murray et al . also noted the presence of very distinctive ( but not quantified ) features among yearly events , with the 1998 leonid light curves characterized by early skewed shapes while those from 1999 showed unusual `` flat topped '' curves .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by koten & borovicka ( 2001 ) . in this , and in all the previously mentioned publications , the lcs were discussed almost exclusively in reference to the single quantitative parameter @xmath0 , the skewness of the lc ( fleming et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the ungluing of a complex of micro - meteoroids , with the subsequent formation of a classical trail , the epitome of the fragmentation model , was shown to fit the vhf radar observations of geminid meteors ( campbell - brown & jones 2003 ) .",
    "the interesting finding of this study is the altitude at which the radius of the trail is zero , and which can be interpreted as the region where the ungluing process begins : approximately 240-km for the geminids .",
    "this fits the region where the high altitude radar echoes connected with meteor activity were detected by the israeli l - band radar ( brosch et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the light produced by many meteors was noted to be far from `` well - behaved '' and steady .",
    "smith ( 1954 ) computed a simple model to account for the sudden brightening of meteor light curves .",
    "these flares cause the brightening of the meteor by 1 - 2 mag and , as explained by smith , are the result of the release of a few thousand particles from the original single - body meteor .",
    "one explanation for this phenomenon , put forward by kramer & gorbanev ( 1990 ) , is that this flaring is produced by the shedding and spraying of a liquid film formed on the leading surface of the ablating meteor .",
    "they described a phenomenon by which the light intensity from the meteor is @xmath2constant , then shows a sudden drop ( depression ) , after which the meteor flares in brightness . therefore , meteor lcs may show both sudden brightening episodes , as well as sudden dimmings .",
    "kramer & gorbanev remarked that meteors showing a depression in their lc have the brightness maximum earlier , on average , than meteors with no depression . in terms of the skewness parameter , such meteors would then be classified as `` early skewers '' .",
    "it seems that in order to discuss statistical properties of meteors it is necessary to use descriptors that would reduce the amount of data characterizing a single lc while providing quantitative measures .",
    "the descriptors could be the symmetry parameter @xmath0 described above and used extensively , or the leading and trailing slopes as described by murray et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and by koten & borovicka ( 2001 )",
    ". these could , in principle , refine the studies where tens to hundreds of lcs are collected and simultaneously analyzed , by reducing each lc to a small set of consistent numbers .",
    "the present paper presents an exploration of measurable parameters in the context of the examination of meteor lcs collected in israel during the 2002 leonid shower . a first attempt was already made in our contribution describing lcs of leonids 2001 , geminids 2001 , and perseids 2002 ( brosch et al .",
    "2002 ) , where the pointedness parameter",
    "_ p _ was introduced ( see below ) .",
    "the 2002 leonid shower was analyzed by arlt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the following preliminary characteristics .",
    "the activity was due to two dust trails , one of cometary dust ejected seven revolutions ago in 1767 that produced a peak zhr of 2510@xmath760 and was seen in asia and europe , and the other by dust ejected four revolutions ago in 1866 that produced a zhr of 2940@xmath7210 and was seen in the americas .",
    "the first peak took place on november 19 at 04:10@xmath71 ut with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 39@xmath73 minutes .",
    "the second was in the same day at 10:47@xmath71 ut with a fwhm of 25@xmath73 minutes .",
    "our observations described below covered the period of the rise toward the twin peaks and a portion of the decay from the peak activity , but neither of the peaks themselves .    here",
    "we expand the discussion to include more parameters and to explore the internal correlations they might show for the case of the meteors observed in november 2002 during the leonid shower by using classical statistical techniques .",
    "this approach is novel in the study of meteor lcs and may prove useful in uncovering hidden connections among the measured parameters , as many lcs are collected and uniformly analyzed in this manner .",
    "we describe our observations in section 2 , the data reduction in section 3 , the analysis and results in section 4 , and conclude in section 5 .",
    "starting in november 1998 , the wise observatory ( wo ) is active in the observation of meteors . from 2001 onward ,",
    "these observations consist of intensified video ( iccd ) measurements , sometimes accompanied by l - band phased - array radar observations .",
    "we do not discuss here the radar observations ( e.g. , brosch et al .",
    "2001 ) , but concentrate exclusively on the analysis of the light curves ( lcs ) derived from the intensified video observations .",
    "the observations reported and analyzed here were collected during five nights , from november 15 - 16 to november 19 - 20 2002 , using mobile meteor detection systems .",
    "each system is based on an itt night vision 18-mm , iii - generation image intensifier ( it ) with a gaas cathode , supplied by collins electro - optics .",
    "the it is optically - coupled to an astrovid 2000 ccd video camera operating in the pal tv standard ( 50 interlaced half - frames per second , or a 20 msec exposure for each half - frame ) .",
    "the it is illuminated by a 50-mm f/0.95 navitar lens and provides a final imaged field of 6@xmath88 degrees@xmath9 .",
    "the astrovid 2000 sends the video stream to a digital hi8 video recorder equipped with a date / time stamper and , in parallel , to a matrox meteor ii frame grabber card mounted in the docking bay of a compaq armada 850 computer .",
    "the log of observations is given in table 1 and shows the number of meteors recorded by the observing stations during each individual night as well as the total number of detected meteors .",
    ".meteor observations , by night and by camera [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that beech & murray ( 2003 ) calculated also the effect of the zenith angle on the light curve .",
    "their figure 7 displays this effect for the @xmath10=1.73 model with the following resuts : z=60@xmath4 ; _ _ f__=0.48 ; z=45@xmath4 : _ _ f__=0.45 , _ _ p__=0.87 ; and z=0@xmath4 : _ _ f__=0.45 , _",
    "_ p__=0.70 .",
    "as mentioned above , their lcs are cut off at high altitude presumably by the evolution beginning at 120 km ; the effect is primarily causing high values for _ p _ and the true _",
    "p _ values can not be easily recovered .",
    "we presented an objective exploration of some measurable parameters of meteor light curves based on a uniform collection of lc from the 2002 leonid shower .",
    "the lcs belong mostly to leonid and sporadic meteors and this allowed an inter - comparison of the properties of these two groups .",
    "the analysis confirmed the reduced importance of the symmetry parameter @xmath0 used in many previous lc analyses , and showed that , at least for te meteor lcs studied here , the most important parameters are the duration , the skewness , and the brightness amplitude . comparisons of the distributions of measured parameters between leonid and sporadic meteors indicated that the leo lcs are more uniform than the spo ones .",
    "the statistical analysis showed that short - duration meteors have stronger sudden brightening and/or dimming episodes ( flares ) than long - duration ones .",
    "the long duration meteors have shallower general brightening and dimming stages .",
    "light curves with early skews , that reach their maximal brightness before the middle of their luminous phase , tend to have lcs with steep slopes .",
    "a pca showed that , at least for the meteors observed in 2002 , three principal components suffice to describe most of the variation observed among the lcs .",
    "the components are related ( in order of importance ) to the duration of a trail , its brightness amplitude , and its amount of skewness .",
    "the `` flaring '' activity presented by a meteor train seems to be related both to the duration of the trail and to its brightness amplitude .",
    "an attempt to compare the meteor lcs characterized here with theoretical models was not very successful because of a lack of published model light curves and of characterizing parameters , such as those defined and tested here .",
    "however , the use of both _ f _ and _ p _ in comparing the observations with the models of murray et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicated similar population indices as estimated for the 2002 leonids by arlt et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "a comparison with the more recent models of beech & murray ( 2003 ) yielded a population index of @xmath11 , rather different from that measured for the 2002 leonids , but probably affected by the lack of data describing the high altitude lc behaviour .",
