    "the scattering of electromagnetic waves from a rough surface has been studied in different domains such as radio - physics , geophysical remote sensing , ocean acoustics , and surface optics .",
    "@xcite one of the earlier theory used , is the small perturbations method ( spm ) originally developped by rice ,  @xcite this theory still remains of interest  @xcite because perturbative terms of order higher than one can produce enhanced backscattering , or improve predictions accuracy in an emission model .",
    "although , the rice method can be used in principle to determine all orders in the perturbative development , very few works use terms of order higher than one for a two - dimensional surface due to the calculations complexity .",
    "the second order has been written in a compact form by voronovich  @xcite in his work on small - slope approximation , and only recently the third order has been presented .",
    "@xcite however , there exists a different way to obtain ( spm ) which dates back from the work of brown _ et al . _",
    "@xcite using both the rayleigh hypothesis and the extinction theorem , they have obtained an integral equation , called the reduced rayleigh equation , which only involves the incident and the scattered field alone . in their method the field transmitted through the surface has been eliminated in such a way that the scattered field becomes a function of the incident field only .",
    "this reduced equation has been extensively used by maradudin _",
    "_ to study localization effects by a conducting surface ,  @xcite coherent effects in reflection factor ,  @xcite scattering by one - dimensional  @xcite and two - dimensional conducting surface .",
    "@xcite it has to be noticed that the third order perturbation term was already explicited in the work of ref .  .",
    "in recent years , similar studies have been done in the case of thin films bounded by a rough surface ,  @xcite but only in the one - dimensional case . in order to calculate the two - dimensional case it becomes necessary to derive an extension of the reduced rayleigh equation for this system . in the present paper ,",
    "we first study a surface where a down - going and up - going fields exist both on the upper and the bottom side of the film .",
    "we show the existence of four equations , that we also call reduced rayleigh equation , they have the property that one of the down - going or up - going fields has been eliminated . with these equations , we rediscover the equation obtained by brown _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for one rough surface , and derive the corresponding ones for a slab where one of the boundary is a rough surface .",
    "next , a perturbative development up to third order is obtained in a compact matrix form for these two systems .",
    "this third order term is mandatory if we need the expression of the cross section up to fourth order approximation . as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the results of the incoherent cross section show a well defined peak in the retroreflection direction .    in the case of small - roughness metallic surfaces",
    "this peak was originaly explained by the infinite perturbation theory ,  @xcite and further developments  @xcite have shown that the major contribution for the enhanced backscattering peak comes from the second order term in the field perturbation . however , in the one dimensional case the enhanced backscattering for a rough surface , appears only for a @xmath0 incident wave due to the fact that plasmons polaritons only exist for this polarization .",
    "in the two dimensional case , due to the existence of cross - polarization , we will show that an incident @xmath1 wave can excite a @xmath0 plasmon mode which can transform into a @xmath1 or @xmath0 volume electromagnetic wave .",
    "thus , the enhanced backscattering is present independently of the polarization of the incident and scattered waves . for a rough dielectric film bounded by a conducting plane",
    "the enhanced backscattering is present for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 incident waves , even in the one - dimensional case because guided waves exist for these two polarizations .",
    "the qualitative effect of the two - dimensional surface is particularly sensitive when we study thin film , for instance , in one - dimensional case , satellite peaks  @xcite appear on each side of the enhanced backscattering peaks , however , in the two - dimensional case , the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes attenuates drastically these peaks .",

    "[ redray ] , we derive the four new reduced rayleigh equations . in sec .",
    "[ rmatrix ] , we introduce the diffusion matrix , and in sec .",
    "[ pertu ] , we determine the perturbative development up to third order term in the surface height , for a rough surface alone , and for slab with a rough surface located at one of the boundaries . in sec .",
    "[ muller ] , we introduce the mueller matrix and the definition of the statistical parameters for the rough surface . we then obtain the bistatic matrix in terms of a perturbative development .",

    "the reduced rayleigh equation was obtained for a two - dimensional surface by brown _ et al . _",
    "@xcite using the extinction theorem and the rayleigh hypothesis , it allows to calculate the scattered field from the rough surface .",
    "now , if we want to compute the transmitted field from the rough surface , one has to introduce an other reduced rayleigh equation derived by greffet .",
    "@xcite however , these two equations were established in the case where there is no up - going field inside the medium , thus they can not be used to obtain the field scattered by a slab with a rough surface in its upper side .",
    "in fact , to generalize these equations to a slab , we have to consider all the fields shown in fig .  [ surface ] .",
    "we will prove that there exists four reduced rayleigh equations , which involve only three of the participating fields @xmath2 .",
    "we consider that each electromagnetic waves propagates with a frequency @xmath3 , and in the following the factor @xmath4 will be omitted .",
    "we choose to work with a cartesian coordinate system @xmath5 , where the z axis directed upward , and we consider a boundary of the form @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , we suppose that there exists a length @xmath7 for which @xmath8 , if @xmath9 or @xmath10 , @xmath7 may be arbitrary large but finite .      the electric field @xmath11 satisfies the helmohltz equation in the two media : @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "since the system is homogeneous in the @xmath14 directions , we can represent the electric field by its fourier transform .",
    "thus , using the helmohltz equation , we deduce the following expression for the electric field  @xcite in the medium 0 : @xmath15 where ( see fig .

    "we need to add an explicit dependence in the @xmath19 coordinate like ( see ref .  ):",
    "@xmath20 however , explicit calculations in the case of infinite conducting surfaces ,  @xcite and for a dielectric medium  @xcite without this hypothesis , have shown that the perturbative developments are identical .",

    "now , when the incident wave is circularly polarized , we see in fig .",

    "if the decomposition of each step of the mutiple scattering process is clearly put in evidence , however , it offers the disadvantage to produce a more heavier perturbative development as it can be seen when comparing ( [ dev1 ] ) and ( [ q+]-[p ] ) with ( 15 - 19,a-1 ) of ref .  .",

    "( [ eqpic ] ) . for the @xmath1 polarization ,",
    "since we have only two guided waves , the satellite peaks can only exist at the angles @xmath305 .",

    ", the slab produces fringes similar to those obtain with a fabry - perrot interferometer illuminated by an extended source .",
    "the roughness modulates amplitude fringes but their localization remains the same as for the interferometer .",
    "we also notice that the enhanced backscattering decreases with the slab thickness .",
    "we can conclude that as in the case of one - dimensional rough surface , the satellite peaks appear only when the wave guide supports few modes for the @xmath1 polarizations .",
    "these results differ from those obtained in ref .   where no satellite peak appears in their two - dimensional slab",
    ", we have checked that with their parameters values we also find no peak , and we agree with the results given by the contributions of the first and second order terms .",
    "however , the third order gives a contribution larger than the first one , such a result casts some doubt on the validity of the ( spm ) method in that case .",
    "however , for the choice of parameters presented here no satellite peak has been observed even when the thickness of the slab is chosen in such a way that only two guided modes exist for the @xmath0 polarization ( a result not presented here ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "for one dimensional surface where it is noticed that the excitation of @xmath0 modes are more difficult to excite than the @xmath1 modes . in order to enhance this effect they choose a higher permittivity for the media 1 : @xmath309 . in this case",
    "satellite peaks are observed for a slab which supports three guided modes .",
    "we have also done numerical calculations with these parameters , however we do not observe satellite peaks .",
    "so the transition from one dimensional to two dimensional rough surface lower the efficiency of the excitation of @xmath0 modes .",
    "next , instead of doubling the slab thickness , we have changed the infinite conducting plane by a silver plane ( @xmath310 ) , we see in fig .",
    "[ slabsupef ] , that the enhancement of backscattering is also decreased , and that there is no more satellite peak corresponding to @xmath1 to @xmath1 scattering .",
    "this fact has to be compared with the next configuration , where the rough surface is now between the media 1 and the media 2 , see fig .",
    "[ slabb ] .    0.2 cm 0.2 cm    the permitivities are the same as in the previous configuration , excepted that the case @xmath274 can not be treated with the ( spm ) because the second and third order diverge .",

    "we have not chosen @xmath311 because numerically we have noticed that the first order term @xmath251 was not greater than the second order @xmath252 , which means that we are near the limit of validity of ( spm ) .",
    "the perturbative development is given by ( [ xb1]-[xb3 ] ) , and the guided modes are the roots of @xmath312^{-1}$ ] for @xmath0 polarization , and of @xmath313^{-1}$ ] for @xmath1 polarization .",
    "we obtain two modes in the @xmath1 case , whose values are : @xmath314 , and @xmath315 , the corresponding satellite peaks angles are : @xmath316 . for the @xmath0 case , we have three guided modes with @xmath317 , @xmath318 and @xmath319 ,",
    "they correspond to six possible sattelite peaks angles given by @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath322 .",
    "we see the apparition of satellite peaks only for @xmath0 to @xmath0 scattering process as shown in fig .",
    "[ slabinf ] .",
    "this result differs from the previous case because , on one hand , the rough surface being not a perfect conductor we still obtain satellite peaks , on the other hand , these satellite peaks now appear for the @xmath0 to @xmath0 polarization instead of @xmath1 to @xmath1 .",
    "this is a surprising result because the @xmath0 polarization which has one more mode than the @xmath1 one , should decrease the amplitude of the satellite peaks for this polarization as it was the case with an upper rough boundary .",
    "moreover , we see in fig .",
    "[ slabinf2 ] , that the three satellite peaks can be clearly separated .",
    "this can be explained from the fact that there are two phenomenons which occur in this case .",
    "the first is the same as in the previous case where the wave can excite guided modes through the roughness which produces the enhancement of backscattering and the satellite peaks .",
    "these effects come from the term @xmath323 in eq .",
    "( [ x2d ] ) where @xmath324 have resonances for the different modes of the guided wave .",
    "but , there is also a second phenomenon which was described in our first example where the rough surface can excite a plasmon mode .",
    "this appears from eq .",
    "( [ x2d ] ) with the term @xmath325 and subsequently in eqs .",
    "( [ incoh2],[ich2 ] ) .",
    "the localization of this mode @xmath259 is given by : @xmath326^{-1}=\\frac{1}{{\\epsilon}_2\\,{\\alpha_{1}({\\boldsymbol}{p}_{r})}+{\\epsilon}_1\\,{\\alpha_{2}({\\boldsymbol}{p}_{r})}}\\ , .\\ ] ] in our case this give @xmath327 which is very close to the value @xmath328 .",

    "now , by doubling the slab thickness , we see from fig .",
    "[ slabinf2h ] that the satellite peaks have disappeared due to the too many guided modes which can be excited .",
    "we have obtained four generalized reduced rayleigh equations which are exact integral equations , and where one of the four unknown fields coming on the rough surface has been eliminated .",
    "these equations offer a systematic method to compute the small perturbation development without lenghty calculations , moreover , the scattering matrices are only two dimensional .",
    "all the theoretical calculations have been done up to order three in the height elevation which allow us to obtain all the fourth - order cross - section terms .",
    "we have calculated the perturbative development for three different structures composed of a rough surface separating to semi - infinite media , and a dielectric film where one of the two boundaries is a rough surface .",
    "for the first structure , the perturbative expression has been already calculated at the third order , but our derivation offers the advantage to be formulated in compact manner making easier numerical computations . for the slabs configuration we present new results .",
    "it has to be noticed that for the case of a rough surface in the upper position , the generalized derivation of the reduced rayleigh equations becomes mandatory .",
    "the numerical results show an enhancement of the backscattering for co- and cross - polarizations in all these cases . in the slab case , for some configurations and definite polarizations ,",
    "we have detected satellite peaks which result from interference of different waveguide modes .",
    "this general formulation can be extended to the configuration including two rough surfaces , and some results will be presented in a next paper .",
