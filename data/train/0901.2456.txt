    "the @xmath0/cft correspondence maps string theory , or certain limits thereof , to quantum field theory . a well - established explicit formulation maps classical supergravity to large @xmath3 gauge theory .",
    "application of the @xmath0/cft correspondence to strongly coupled systems at finite temperature and particle density is interesting from two points of view .",
    "first , holographic models allow for qualitative comparison of string - theory motivated calculations with phenomenology .",
    "second , the @xmath0/cft correspondence provides a very useful approach to dynamical processes in strongly coupled field theories .",
    "holographic models therefore may prove to be valuable tools to gain insight into the nature of matter under extreme conditions , as it existed shortly after the big bang or in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we pursue the strategy of the top  down approach .",
    "this means we use solutions of ten - dimensional supergravity to investigate the properties of the dual field theories .",
    "in this way we restrict our attention to the best accessible field theory limits , i.e.  asymptotic low energy , large number @xmath3 of color degrees of freedom and strong coupling .",
    "in particular we are interested in bound states of fundamental and anti - fundamental matter described by the hypermultiplet of @xmath2 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory , accompanied by gauge fields in the adjoint gauge multiplet of @xmath1 sym theory .",
    "we interpret these bound states as quark - antiquark mesons in a quark - gluon plasma . in the quantum field theory ,",
    "the vector valued bound states of quarks can be described by the retarded two - point correlation function @xmath4 of flavor currents @xmath5 , @xmath6\\big>.\\ ] ] generalizations of the @xmath0/cft correspondence allow to compute these correlators at _ strong coupling _ , and to derive meson mass spectra from them .",
    "the same methods can be used to estimate the effect of strong coupling on meson diffusion .",
    "the coupling constant in our effective model is determined by the quotient @xmath7 of t  hooft coupling and quark mass .",
    "we compare momentum broadening at _ strong coupling _ , obtained from @xmath0/cft calculations , to perturbative results at _",
    "weak coupling_. these efforts are motivated by the search for a mechanism of the suppression of heavy quarks observed at rhic , and energy loss of mesons in the strongly coupled medium .",
    "we work in the d3/d7 setup , where a finite small number of @xmath8 d7-branes is embedded into the @xmath9 black hole background , which is generated by a stack of @xmath10 d3-branes .",
    "we restrict to the low energy limit , where the resulting degrees of freedom of string excitations are dual to the @xmath1 gauge multiplet plus the @xmath2 hypermultiplet of sym theory .",
    "we mainly focus on the latter degrees of freedom which transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we may therefore interpret @xmath3 as the number of colors , @xmath8 as the number of flavors , and the hypermultiplet as the supersymmetric realization of quark fields .    according to the @xmath0/cft dictionary ,",
    "the parameters and fields of the gravity setup translate into field theory equivalents as follows .",
    "the @xmath0 black hole radius is proportional to the field theory temperature @xmath13 , which breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the separation of the d3- and d7-branes is proportional to the quark mass @xmath14 , which breaks conformal symmetry .",
    "we normalize dimensionful quantities to the temperature and use @xmath15 as a free parameter .",
    "the second free parameter is the particle density @xmath16 , which is proportional to the value of the time component of the @xmath12 valued gauge field @xmath17 in the supergravity theory , evaluated on the boundary of @xmath18 space .",
    "additional to the flavor symmetry group @xmath12 the full symmetry group @xmath19 of the brane configuration also exhibits a @xmath20 factor .",
    "we work in @xmath21 and interpret the @xmath22 charge as baryon number and the @xmath23 charge as isospin number . in this way we can tune the baryon and isospin particle density @xmath16 by specifying the boundary value of @xmath17 @xcite .    to derive the spectra of bound states of quark - antiquark pairs as above ,",
    "we need to determine the embedding of the d7-branes as well as the gauge field configuration on the brane .",
    "they are determined by extremizing the dirac - born - infeld action , which is given by @xmath24 here the d7-brane embeddings determine the induced metric @xmath25 of the d7-brane , and @xmath26 is the field strength tensor of the gauge field on the brane , and @xmath27 is the brane tension .",
    "we describe the field theory meson spectrum in terms of the spectral function @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 to obtain @xmath4 , as defined in , we make use of the @xmath0/cft correspondence which allows us to identify the partition sum of the d3/d7 setup with the generating functional of the dual field theory .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath30 .",
    "as the boundary value of the gauge field @xmath17 is the source of the operator @xmath5 in , we can obtain correlation functions by evaluating functional derivatives of the above partition function @xcite .",
    "explicit calculation @xcite yields @xmath31 where we have to insert @xmath17 , which we obtain as a numerical solution to the equations of motion derived from the dbi action @xcite .",
    "the resulting vector meson spectra depending on the normalized frequency @xmath32 for @xmath21 are shown in figures  [ fig : speccompare],[fig : specdensities ] and  [ fig : specsplit ] .    ' '' ''        ' '' ''        ' '' ''        in figure  [ fig : speccompare ] we compare the obtained spectra for a certain choice of quark mass / temperature ratio and particle density to the analytically known line spectrum for the case of zero temperature and vanishing particle density , where supersymmetry is restored . at low temperatures we observe resonance peaks in the derived spectra in accordance with the expectations from supersymmetric setups .",
    "moreover we also see the phenomenologically expected behavior of finite resonance peak widths , indicating finite lifetimes of the bound states at finite temperature , referred to as _ meson melting_. figure  [ fig : specdensities ] shows the influence of variations in the particle density .",
    "increasing the density destabilizes the bound states and slightly shifts the positions of the resonance peaks to higher energies .",
    "such in - medium effects have also been observed in effective field theory models @xcite .",
    "we do _ not _ observe brown - rho scaling , which predicts decreasing meson masses @xcite .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : specsplit ] shows the splitting of the vector meson spectrum at finite isospin density .",
    "the isospin @xmath33 quarks combine to the different possible combinations constituting an isospin @xmath34 meson triplet with @xmath35 components @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "in this section we summarize the results of @xcite obtained in collaboration with k. dusling , d. teaney , and c. young . we make use of the effective lagrangian from @xcite for the heavy meson field @xmath39 with mass @xmath40 .",
    "transcription to @xmath1 sym theory in lowest order in @xmath41 yields @xmath42 we refer to the last two terms as the interaction lagrangian @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath45-component of the energy momentum tensor and @xmath46 is the operator which mediates the coupling of the mesons to the gauge bosons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 determine the mass shift of the mesons in medium by @xmath49 .    in a langevin process the diffusion of the mesons in the medium",
    "can be described by the momentum broadening @xmath50 , which determines the change of momentum @xmath51 by damping and a random force @xmath52 ( random kicks ) by @xmath53 on time scales short compared to equilibration times but long compared to medium correlations we have @xmath54 we derive the force @xmath55 from the interaction lagrangian @xmath56 , given by the last two terms in , @xmath57 . plugging this into leads to @xmath58 the two - point correlation functions @xmath4 of the energy momentum tensor and the field strength tensor",
    "can be obtained perturbatively at weak coupling , and via @xmath0/cft at strong coupling in a similar way as above .",
    "the same applies for the mass shift @xmath59 .",
    "the quotient @xmath60 does not depend on the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath48 .",
    "we can compare this quantity in the limit of weak coupling with the result at asymptotically strong coupling @xcite , @xmath62_{\\lambda\\to 0}=\\frac{\\pi t}{n^2}\\,37.0\\ : ,          \\qquad\\qquad          \\left [ \\frac{\\kappa}{(\\delta m)^2}\\right]_{\\lambda\\to\\infty}=\\frac{\\pi t}{n^2}\\,8.3\\:.\\ ] ] we thus see that the momentum broadening is reduced in the limit of strong coupling , leading to increased diffusion and relaxation time .",
    "using the example of the d3/d7 system , we showed that holographic models are capable of describing spectra of meson - like bound states of supersymmetric fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "these spectra exhibit many qualitative features expected in finite temperature , finite density strongly coupled qcd . among these are increased decay rates at high temperature , in - medium effects of increased decay rates and mass shifts at finite particle density , as well as the triplet splitting of vector meson spectra at finite isospin density .    in an effective lagrangian model we used holographic techniques to estimate strong coupling effects on meson diffusion in a model of the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the results suggest that the drag forces on mesons in the medium are reduced at strong coupling , such that momentum broadening in the medium is reduced and relaxation times increase . in this sense",
    "the observed suppression of the quarkonium drag coefficient is analog to the suppression of the shear viscosity coefficient at strong coupling .",
