    "weak perturbations of limit cycle oscillators are of great interest in a variety of fields in physics , chemistry , engineering , and quantitative biology , whenever the system under study displays stable oscillations .",
    "a powerful theoretical approach in the analysis of weakly perturbed limit cycles , particularly in relation to synchronization and phase lock of a network of oscillators , is to reduce the description of the system to a single `` phase '' variable .",
    "this phase reduction procedure is the focus of the present paper .    in this introduction , we begin by describing a standard numerical approach for obtaining first order phase reduction , due to i.g .",
    "malkin @xcite .",
    "we then explain our higher order method , which is summarized in theorem [ main_theorem ] , and illustrate it in order @xmath0 using the well - known stuart - landau oscillator as an example .",
    "proofs are are given in the subsequent sections .",
    "our focus is on the theoretical underpinnings of the method rather than on the details of numerical implementation , but we provide a numerical example to illustrate the approach .",
    "the following set - up is assumed to hold throughout .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth ( i.e. , continuously differentiable to all orders ) vector field on @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space @xmath3 .",
    "the flow line of an initial point @xmath4 will be denoted @xmath5 , or simply @xmath6 , for @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a stable ( hyperbolic ) limit cycle of the differential equation @xmath9 having period @xmath10 .",
    "we write @xmath11 for the reciprocal of the period .",
    "the stability condition means that for any given point @xmath4 on @xmath8 , there exists a linear @xmath12-dimensional subspace @xmath13 in @xmath3 transverse to @xmath14 such that vectors in @xmath13 contract exponentially under positive iterations of the differential @xmath15 of the flow map at @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath16 for positive constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 , positive integer @xmath2 , and all @xmath19 in @xmath13 .",
    "as we are only concerned with the system near @xmath8 , there is no loss of generality in assuming that @xmath1 is a complete vector field , so that the flow lines @xmath5 are defined for all @xmath7 and all @xmath20 .",
    "we briefly review a few well - known facts about the dynamics near a stable limit cycle for the purpose of setting up notation .    due to normal hyperbolicity on @xmath8 , it is known @xcite that a neighborhood of the limit cycle is continuously foliated by contracting manifolds , @xmath21 , for each @xmath22 , where the @xmath21 are smooth submanifolds tangent to @xmath13 at @xmath4 and diffeomorphic to an open disc .",
    "the foliation is invariant , i.e. , @xmath23 maps @xmath21 into @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and all @xmath4 in @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the foliation is smooth since @xmath8 is an orbit of a smooth flow .",
    "in fact , we can use maps of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to produce smooth foliation charts around @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a function defined on a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath8 , whose level sets are the local contracting manifolds and such that @xmath30 modulo integer translations .",
    "i.e. , @xmath29 takes values in @xmath31 .",
    "we often regard @xmath29 simply as a function into @xmath32 , keeping in mind that , in this case , @xmath33 .",
    "derivatives of @xmath29 , on the other hand , are single - valued functions into @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to @xmath29 as the _ phase function _ of the oscillator .",
    "it is , thus , a smooth function on some neighborhood of the limit cycle such that @xmath34 iff @xmath35 as @xmath36 whenever @xmath22 and y lies in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "the level sets of @xmath29 are also called _ isochrons _ @xcite .",
    "the existence of isochrons was first proved in @xcite .",
    "since the component functions of the gradient of @xmath29 give the change in phase due to a small change in the respective position coordinates @xcite , the graphs of those functions are often referred to as _ phase response curves_. this notion is widely used in theoretical and experimental neuroscience .",
    "for example , some theoretical studies have examined how the shape of the phase response curves affect the sychronization dynamics of coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "other studies have investigated the connection between phase response curves and mechanisms of brain function and pathology such as autoassociative memory @xcite and epileptic seizures @xcite .",
    "the phase response curves of neurons in the neocortex have been experimentally determined @xcite .      before explaining our main results , which are collected in theorem [ main_theorem ] , it is useful to briefly review the standard method of phase reduction . for a more complete discussion",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , chapter 10 , and to @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see why the derivatives of @xmath29 are needed when studying weak perturbations of a stable oscillator described by @xmath9 .",
    "let such a perturbation be given by the new equation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a small positive number .",
    "then @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gradient of the phase function . writing @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the point on the limit cycle on the same isochron as @xmath6 , then @xmath43 one then proceeds by discarding the term @xmath44 and analyzing the resulting system .",
    "thus implementing the phase reduction method in order @xmath45 in @xmath46 requires finding the gradient of the phase function along the limit cycle of the unperturbed oscillator , denoted by @xmath47 in the last equation .",
    "one practical method for obtaining the gradient of @xmath29 is by solving the equation : @xmath48 where the dot indicates time derivative and @xmath49 is the transpose of the jacobian matrix of @xmath1 evaluated along the limit cycle .",
    "this procedure was suggested by malkin @xcite and later by others independently @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , chapter 9 , for more details of the malkin s theorem and @xcite , chapter 10 for a historical note on phase reduction .",
    "one can find @xmath47 by numerically integrating the equation backwards in time for any initial condition satisfying @xmath50 , over an interval of time long enough to allow the solution to stabilize to a periodic one @xcite .",
    "one limitation of the method as presented above is that it is only valid to first order . to develop higher order phase reduction ,",
    "it is necessary to obtain higher order partial derivatives of @xmath29 .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , an approach to higher order approximations of @xmath29 similar in spirit to the above due to malkin for finding the gradient of @xmath29 has not been described so far in the literature .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to develop a numerical method to obtain partial derivatives of @xmath29 to arbitrary order .    even within the framework of first order phase reduction ( _ i.e. _ equation ) , in certain situations , as when dealing with weak stochastic perturbations of oscillators",
    ", one may need to know the derivatives of @xmath29 along the limit cycle to orders greater than @xmath45 .",
    "for example , in @xcite , a stochastic version of phase reduction is given using the 2nd order partial derivatives of @xmath29 to obtain the mean and variance of the period of a limit cycle oscillator .",
    "they apply their results to the stuart - landau oscillator , for which an explicit form of @xmath29 can be obtained analytically . in general",
    ", however , an analytical form of @xmath29 is not available . therefore , the method we present here is of particular interest in order two for studying the dynamics of a limit cycle oscillator subjected to stochastic perturbations .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in a future paper .",
    "the main result of this paper , which is described in theorem [ main_theorem ] below , amounts to a recursive procedure for finding the higher order derivatives of @xmath29 in which the first step is malkin s method just described .",
    "we need a few definitions first .",
    "let @xmath51 be any vector in @xmath52 and @xmath53 any differentiable real - valued function in @xmath54 .",
    "given a multi - index @xmath55 , i.e. , an @xmath2-dimensional vector with non - negative integer entries , we write @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 times ) .",
    "let @xmath62 represent the symmetric @xmath61-multilinear map on @xmath3 characterized ( via polarization of polynomial maps ) by @xmath63 for all @xmath64 .",
    "the sum is over all multi - indices @xmath65 of order @xmath66 . here , and often later",
    ", we omit reference to the point @xmath4 where the derivatives are taken . when necessary , this point is indicated as a sub - index ; thus @xmath67 is the bilinear map evaluated at the vectors @xmath68 regarded as tangent vectors at @xmath20 , where @xmath4 is the point where the partial derivatives of @xmath53 are calculated .",
    "we now define @xmath69 for some fixed @xmath20 , where @xmath23 is the flow of @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath70 , which is now a vector valued , symmetric , @xmath61-multilinear map .",
    "( a convenient alternative description of @xmath71 and @xmath70 , and more generally of the higher order derivative forms associated to tensor fields , will be given later in the paper . ) in particular , @xmath72 is the linear map which to @xmath64 gives the directional derivative of @xmath1 along @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is defined by this identity .",
    "another general concept needed below is the _ symmetric composition _ of multilinear maps , which we define as follows .",

    "this expansion is described in section [ forest ] .",
    "the equation for the standard ( malkin s ) method of phase reduction for obtaining the gradient of @xmath29 is the equation in part 1 of the theorem when @xmath92 : @xmath111 furthermore , @xmath112 is the unique periodic solution such that @xmath113 .",
    "this unique solution can be found numerically , according to part 2 , by the following procedure : let a covector @xmath114 ( i.e. , a linear map from @xmath3 to @xmath32 ) at @xmath115 be a choice of initial condition for equation [ malkin1 ] which is arbitrary except for the normalization @xmath116 .",
    "one then integrates equation for @xmath117 ( backward integration ) until the solution stabilizes to a periodic ( co)-vector - valued function on the limit cycle .",
    "stabilization is assured to happen for sufficiently large @xmath118 .",
    "this periodic function is the solution we want in order one .",
    "the general order case is then given recursively by the successive applications of the theorem .    before presenting the proof ,",
    "we illustrate the use of the theorem with the stuart - landau oscillator .      to illustrate the method , we focus attention on the case @xmath119 . from the general definition of symmetric composition introduced above we have that @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given by @xmath122    we suppose that @xmath47 has already been obtained ( say , by the standard method ) and wish to find @xmath123 .",
