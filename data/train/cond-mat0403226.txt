    "the investigation of semiconducting nanoclusters is one of the most promising directions in the search for new materials to construct optical and electronic devices , new laser materials , and biological markers  @xcite .",
    "the properties of nanosize clusters are typically very different from their parent bulk compounds ; for example , surface passivated silicon nanoclusters show a number of interesting effects such as ultrabright luminescence  @xcite and nonlinear optical effects  @xcite , whereas crystalline bulk silicon is optically uninteresting because of its small and indirect gap .",
    "previous theoretical studies have employed various methods to model and understand the basic structural and electronic properties of nanosize clusters such as tight - binding  @xcite , empirical pseudopotentials  @xcite , density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , gw - bethe salpeter ( gw - bse )  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite .   despite the significant progress that has been made , especially in interpreting the properties of larger clusters ( @xmath0 2 nm , @xmath0 500 atoms ) , many open questions still exist as to how new physical effects begin to dominate the electronic structure of these clusters as the surface to volume ratio increases .",
    "these effects include the possibility of surface states , reconstructions , and impurities .",
    "recent optical measurements of silicon nanocrystals synthesized in macroscopic quantities using a process of first etching and then sonically breaking up a silicon wafer  @xcite appear to have predominantly spherical shapes , show ultrabright luminescence , and are produced in remarkably uniform batches .",
    "the smallest silicon nanoclusters in the range of 1 to 1.2 nm  @xcite synthesized through this method exhibit significantly different properties compared with predictions from previous studies such as smaller absorption gaps and different red shifted emission peaks ( i.e.  the stokes shift )  @xcite .",
    "understanding the differences in these two characteristics call for high quality electronic structure calculations which can precisely describe the effects of electron correlation in ground and excited states , charge transfers , and different surface bonding networks .    in this article",
    ", we present a state - of - the - art computational study of @xmath1 1 nm hydrogenated si nanocluster prototype systems in order to understand the interplay between their electronic and optical properties , their surface states and structures , and to interpret their absorption and emission processes .",
    "we employ a combination of high accuracy _ ab initio _ methods including dft ( using the local density approximation ( lda ) and the perdew burke ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite and b3lyp flavors of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) ) and qmc to elucidate the electronic and structural properties of the most relevant structural prototypes .",
    "we focus on systems with 50 to 70 total atoms which are consistent with the observed sizes that emit in the blue or at the uv edge ( @xmath1 2.90 ev ) .",
    "we find that surface dimerization is considered as the best possible mechanism for the occurrence of smaller gaps and stokes shifts than would otherwise be expected in this size range  @xcite .",
    "we use our derived models to study the structural and electronic effects related to the observed stokes shift , namely the energy difference between absorbed and emitted photons and the character of the corresponding exciton state .",
    "the high accuracy of our qmc calculations enables us to deduce that the mechanism most likely to be responsible for the stokes shift in these systems is due to _ a global relaxation of the cluster _ rather than the stretch mode of a single surface dimer  @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that the accurate calculation of a combination of properties is critical for a full understanding of surface reconstructions , doping , and the stokes shift of nanoclusters in this size range .",
    "finally , we find that despite its agreement in determining optical gaps for spherical silicon nanocrystals , b3lyp compares less favorably with qmc results for systems with reconstructed surfaces or with oxygenated surfaces .",
    "to construct structural prototypes , we start from the bulk silicon lattice and choose a spherical region as this has the smallest surface area for a given number of atoms . the dangling bonds on the surface are saturated with hydrogen and the terminated si atoms are classified into -sih , -sih@xmath2 and -sih@xmath3 types . the structures with -sih@xmath3 are discarded as they are energetically less favorable and therefore prone to reactions with the environment .",
    "considering prototypes with -sih and -sih@xmath2 terminations in the 1 - 1.2 nm size regime leads to two likely ideal structures , si@xmath4h@xmath5 and si@xmath6h@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sih ] ) .   in some cases",
    ", dft calculations using a planewave basis and norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite are used to establish the equilibrium geometries and the electronic structure of these systems with a kinetic energy cutoff of 35  ry , a gianozzi pseudopotential for hydrogen  @xcite , and a hamann pseudopotential for all other atoms  @xcite .   in other cases , gaussian all - electron calculations using a 6 - 311g@xmath7 basis is used  @xcite .",
    "as we have previously observed  @xcite , the relaxed structures are very similar when calculated using either lda or gradient corrected ( pbe ) functionals and are fairly close to the original bulk derived structures with small adjustments of the bond lengths and angles , predominantly of the surface atoms . for each cluster ,",
    "the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo)/ lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) gap is calculated using lda , pbe , and the b3lyp functional .",
    "h@xmath5 , si@xmath4h@xmath5 , and si@xmath4h@xmath8 nanocrystals .",
    "the larger spheres represent si atoms while the smaller ones the hydrogens . note the surface reconstruction of the top dimer from si@xmath4h@xmath5 to si@xmath4h@xmath8 . ]",
    "although dft techniques produce accurate minimum energy structures of silicon nanoclusters and also reliably predict the trends in the optical gap of a given structural type as a function of size  @xcite , a more accurate approach , for example , qmc which takes many - body effects into account is required to predict the difference in optical gaps between different classes of structural prototypes , such as clusters with different surface passivants , clusters with reconstructed surfaces , or clusters with amorphous - like geometries .",
    "in addition to the computed dft gaps , we therefore adopt a previously described qmc procedure  @xcite to perform qmc calculations using the casino code  @xcite for the optical gaps discussed in this paper .",
    "the smallest experimentally measured clusters are determined to be @xmath9  nm in diameter  @xcite .",
    "1  nm clusters are too small to observe crystallinity using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , so the structure must be discerned from other experimental methods , or deduced from physical properties such as the absorption gap and the stokes shift . indeed ,",
    "even if tem or other methods were capable of resolving the crystallinity of 1  nm clusters , it could not predict the surface chemistry . in a previous work ,",
    "we compared the absorption gap of 1  nm spherical silicon nanoclusters with two types of reconstructed surfaces  @xcite .   amongst the various structures analyzed , only clusters with reconstructed dimers yielded results consistent with the experimentally measured gaps .",
    "however , in addition to all possible oxygenated clusters which were not considered , a recent molecular dynamics calculation predicted that amorphous - like 1  nm clusters can have similar gaps to those with reconstructed dimers  @xcite .   here",
    ", we have recalculated the gaps of these ideal and reconstructed clusters , now using linear scaling qmc  @xcite which has allowed us to obtain much smaller statistical errors , and compared them with the double cored clusters  @xcite as well as various oxygenated clusters .   for comparison",
    ", we also compute all relevant homo / lumo gaps within dft using various functionals , focusing on the b3lyp functional in order to make a more complete comparison of this functional with computationally demanding many - body qmc results .",
    "table  1 shows that the optical absorption gaps as calculated within qmc of two completely hydrogenated spherical crystalline nanoclusters about 1  nm in diameter , si@xmath4h@xmath5 and si@xmath6h@xmath5 ( 5.3 and 4.9 ev ) are larger than our experimentally measured value of @xmath1  3.5 ev@xcite , while the crystalline cluster with reconstructed dimers are in agreement with experiment as previously shown  @xcite .",
    "a comparison with oxygenated clusters indicates that those with bridged oxygen are significantly higher than our experimental gaps , while those with double bonded oxygen are significantly lower , in both cases differing by over 1 ev",
    ".   however , these gaps are consistent with the calculated gaps of double core amorphous - like clusters  @xcite , suggesting both structures should be analyzed further .",
    ".calculated optical gaps ( ev ) of some prototype 1  nm clusters using three different methods .",
    "the statistical errors in the qmc values are in parenthesis . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also consider here the non - crystalline 1  nm clusters which have been predicted to form during chemical vapor deposition at high temperatures by quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "although not applicable to the sonification process demonstrated here , these non - crystalline clusters were shown to have a gap comparable to those with ideal reconstructed clusters .",
    "we calculate the stokes shift of these clusters to ascertain whether they have the 0.4 to 0.5 ev stokes shifts observed in our clusters and predicted for reconstructed clusters .",
    "surprisingly , we find very large stokes shifts , on the order of the gap size !",
    "these non - crystalline 1  nm clusters behave more like small molecules  @xcite than quantum dots .",
    "thus , the stokes shift has proved a very powerful characterization technique eliminating the `` double core '' non - crystalline clusters as being those observed here .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out a thorough study of hydrogen terminated silicon nanoclusters in the 1 - 1.2 nm range .",
    "we investigated several prototype structures and compared their optical absorption gaps and stokes shifts with recent measurements and found that although a few other structures may yield a similar gap , most notably an amorphous - like double core cluster , only si@xmath4h@xmath8 yields both the correct gap and stokes shift .",
    "thus , we determine that _ both _ properties must be considered when evaluating candidate structures to interpret optical measurements .",
    "we determined that b3lyp generates inconsistent results for clusters with localized orbitals compared with qmc level calculations .",
    "the atomistic first - principles dft approaches coupled with qmc allowed us to study the optically induced excitons and to conclude that the most likely mechanism causing the stokes shift is the barrierless relaxation of the whole structure with the red shift of @xmath1  0.4  ev in agreement with experiment . comparison with further experimental data indicates that the si@xmath4h@xmath8 structural prototype is the most promising candidate of the possibilities we tested .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of doping with a number of atoms and molecular groups . like ideal unreconstructed structures , @xmath10",
    "bonded passivants have a minimal effect on absorption gaps , as do single bridged passivants .",
    "therefore , other atoms or ligands may be used to functionalize these clusters with no discernible change to the gap .",
