    "there is a strong belief that qcd is equivalent to a string theory and that this equivalence could play an important role in the development of the theory of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "the solution of the two - dimensional qcd in terms of strings has been invoked to put forward the ultimate conjecture that qcd is actually equivalent to string theory .",
    "the @xmath1 string has the property to suppress folding of the surface and therefore has a kind of extrinsic curvature @xcite .    in the recent articles @xcite the authors suggested a geometrical string , which directly extends the notion of the feynman integral over paths to an integral over surfaces . in this theory the surface which degenerates into a single particle world line",
    "has an amplitude which is proportional to the length of world line .",
    "this approach was motivated by the fact that in the first approximation the motion of the particle with internal structure is described by the action which should be proportional to the length of the spacetime path @xcite .",
    "this principle , together with the continuity principle allows to define the action of the theory @xmath0 . for the smooth surfaces this action is proportional to the mean extrinsic curvature and",
    "has the property to suppress the folding of the surface @xcite .",
    "the degree of suppression depends on the gonimetric factor @xmath2 in the definition of the action @xmath0 and can be made arbitrary large .",
    "for that the @xmath2 should grow fast enough near the dihedral angles close to @xmath3 which describe a flat surfaces @xcite .    in the subsequent publication @xcite",
    "the authors have found that the action @xmath0 has an equivalent representation in terms of the total curvature @xmath4 of the polygons @xmath5 which appear in the intersection of the plane @xmath6 with the given surface @xmath7 .",
    "the curvature @xmath4 should then be integrated over all planes @xmath6 intersecting the surface @xmath7 .",
    "this representation has been proven for the special case of the action @xmath0 , when the action depends linearly on dihedral angle @xmath8 . to provide necessary rigidity of the polygons @xmath9 and the corresponding suppression of the folding of the surface it is important to have generalization of the curvature representation for the cases when the dependence on the dihedral angle @xmath8 is arbitrary @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to perform numerical analyses of the curvature representation of the gonihedric action for the cases when dependence on the dihedral angle is arbitrary .",
    "the gonihedric string has been formulated in an euclidean space @xmath10 , where the feynman integral coincides with the partition function for the randomly fluctuating surfaces . in the continuum euclidean",
    "space @xmath10 the random surface is associated with a connected polyhedral surface @xmath7 with vertex coordinates @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the number of the vertices .",
    "the action is defined as @xcite    @xmath14 where the gonimetric factor @xmath2 is defined as    @xmath15 @xmath16 the summation is over all edges @xmath17 of @xmath7 and @xmath18 is a dihedral angle between two neighbor faces ( flat triangles ) of @xmath7 in @xmath10 having a common edge @xmath17 .",
    "the property ( 3 ) always allows to consider the argument of the @xmath2 function to be in the interval @xmath19 in all subsequent computations .",
    "one can say that we are measuring the dihedral angle @xmath18 from that side of the surface where it is less than @xmath3 . as it is easy to see the action indeed has the physical dimension of the length and the degree of the suppression of the folding of the surface depends on @xmath2 @xcite . in cases",
    "when the @xmath2 is equal to @xmath20 and @xmath21 the suppression can be made arbitrary large .",
    "the physical properties of this model and possible connection with qcd have been discussed in @xcite .    as we stress above the new representation of action @xmath0",
    "have been proven @xcite for the special case when the factor @xmath2 is linear @xmath22 in the present article we shall perform the numerical analyses of the curvature representation for the cases when the dependence on the dihedral angle is arbitrary .",
    "the numerical integration shows that one can always select the dependence from the dihedral angle so as to provide necessary rigidity of the polygons @xmath23 and therefore corresponding suppression of the folding of the surfaces .",
    "this may help to proceed with the analytical results for the general case .",
    "if we denote by @xmath24 the angle which appears in the intersection of the plane @xmath6 with dihedral angle @xmath18 of the edge @xmath17 , then the total curvature @xmath4 of the polygon or polygons appearing in the intersection is equal to the following sum @xcite    @xmath25 here we imply that @xmath24 is equal to @xmath3 for the edges @xmath17 which are not intersected by the given plane @xmath6 . with this definitions the gonihedric action @xmath0 is equal to @xcite    @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the invariant measure of two - dimensional planes @xmath6 in @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this measure can be defined explicitly in @xmath28 through the coordinates of the unit vector @xmath29 which is normal to the plane @xmath6 and through the distance @xmath30 of the plane @xmath6 from the origin @xcite    @xmath31 to prove the representation ( 6 ) let us substitute ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) into ( 6 ) , this yields @xcite    @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 where    @xmath35 now one should prove , that @xmath36 in ( 9 ) , after averaging over all orientations of the plane @xmath6 is indeed equal to @xmath37 ( 4 ) .",
    "this has been proven in @xcite , but here we will present a new proof which allows to apply numerical integration to more complicated cases .",
    "we have the following expression for @xmath38    @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle in the intersection of the plane @xmath6 with dihedral angle @xmath8 .",
    "it is very hard to integrate directly ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) to get ( 4 ) . instead of",
    "that we would like to remark , that from ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) it follows that    @xmath42 and that    @xmath43 where as before we imply that all angles are in the interval @xmath19 ( see property ( 2 ) ) .",
    "the basic property of the dihedral angle @xmath44 is the @xmath45 property    @xmath46 which follows from the geometrical picture or one can check it directly using explicit formula ( 10 ) .    now substituting ( 13 ) into ( 9 ) and using ( 12 )",
    "we will get    @xmath47 the last functional equation together with the boundary condition ( 11 ) has unique solution    @xmath48 this completes the proof of the curvature representation ( 6 ) and ( 5 ) for @xmath0 in the particular case ( 4 ) .",
    "our aim is to extend this result into the cases when @xmath36 is an arbitrary function of @xmath37 .",
    "generally one can expect that    @xmath49 where the extended curvature @xmath50 is defined as    @xmath51 and the function @xmath52 is defined by the integration over all planes @xmath6    @xmath53 now the problem is to select an appropriate function @xmath54 in the definition of the total curvature @xmath50 such that the integration over all planes @xmath6 will produce the gonimetric factor @xmath2 with the necessary properties ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the most important cases are when @xmath54 is a power of @xmath55    @xmath56 or a root function @xmath57 it is also interesting to compute the two angle correlation function    @xmath58 which is defined by the integral    @xmath59 as it is easy to see from ( 9),(10 ) and from the last integral it is almost impossible to compute these explicitly , therefore we should use the numerical integration to study their behaviour .",
    "in figure 1 we show the result of the integration over all planes @xmath60 in ( 18 ) for various functions @xmath54 .",
    "as we see the qualitative behaviour of the gonimetric function @xmath2 is very similar to the behaviour of the corresponding @xmath54 function .",
    "[ fig31 ]    [ fig32 ]    therefore it is reasonable to ask how big is the  deformation \" of the functions ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) after integration over all planes @xmath60 in ( 18 ) , that is the magnitude of the differences @xmath61 or @xmath62 in figure 2 one can see that the differences are not very large , but the equality between these two quantities is definitely excluded . only for @xmath63 does the equality hold @xcite .",
    "the question to which we can not get an answer by numerical analyses is how to select the function @xmath54 in ( 17 ) to recover the power or root behaviour of the @xmath2 function , that is to find out the coefficients @xmath64 in the @xmath54 series    @xmath65 such that    @xmath66 our numerical results indicate that the biggest coefficient in ( 26 ) is @xmath67 .",
    "figure 3 shows the behaviour of the correlation function @xmath68 for various values of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 . again",
    "the function @xmath68 does not simply coincide with @xmath71",
    "finally we should stress that the curvature representation is very helpful in establishing global properties of the action and hence of the partition function and the loop green functions @xcite ."
