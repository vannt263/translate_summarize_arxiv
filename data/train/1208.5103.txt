    "transforming a complicated quantum system into classical one provides a lot of useful insights into wide area of theoretical physics .",
    "a prototypical example in string - theory community is the anti - de sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new variational formulation for quantum critical models , the so - called multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) , has been proposed in statistical physics with the help of quantum - information knowledge , and it is a hot topic to examine the similarity between mera and ads / cft  @xcite . even apart from these theories , the suzuki - trotter breakup has been a very important quantum - classical correspondence for a long time  @xcite .",
    "it is thus attracting much attention to know common mathematical properties behind them .    the ads / cft correspondence is the conjectured equivalence between a string theory with gravity defined on a spacetime and a quantum field theory without gravity defined on the conformal boundary of the spacetime .",
    "the background field in the gravity side is described by the ads ( hyperbolic ) metric .",
    "this equivalence transforms a @xmath0-dimensional strong - coupling quantum critical theory into a @xmath1-dimensional classical einstein gravity in the limit that the curvature radius of ads is much larger than the length scale of a string .",
    "thus , this is a kind of holographic or duality theory .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath2 in the classical side ( holographic space ) corresponds to a scale parameter in the quantum side . by changing @xmath2 systematically , we know the behaviors of the @xmath0-dimensional quantum field theory in various energy scales , and this method gives a framework of renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "thus , this framework is called holographic rg . in general",
    ", an interacting quantum system is characterized by competition among various energy - scale ( or length - scale ) physics .",
    "thus if it s possible to decompose the original quantum model into a set of effective models , each of which has a particular energy scale , each model would behave classically or as a gapped quantum system with exponentially - damped quantum correlation .",
    "therefore , the decomposition necessarily induces the extra degree of freedom associated with the scale .    on the other hand ,",
    "mera is a variational wave function appropriate for @xmath0-dimensional quantum critical models .",
    "the total amount of the physical information in the model is quite huge in critical cases , and thus we decompose it into a set of tensors with smaller dimensions .",
    "then , the sequencial optimization of each tensor is numerically possible .",
    "the tensor product forms a network , the so - called mera network , in a @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "the network structure resembles to a discretization of the ads space , and the relation between mera and ads / cft was proposed .",
    "mera is also viewed as a holographic rg theory , since the entanglement entropy in this variational representation obeys some scaling fromulae required for the holographic rg .",
    "the existence of ads / cft - type dualities including mera and non - ads cases has been checked by many examples , and it would be no doubt correct . however , we would like to get more conclusive data independent of details of each model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an information - theoretical approach in order to give some alternative viewpoints to these correspondences .",
    "since our targets spread into the wide area , it would be possible to drop the details of the models and to pick up common mathematical background .",
    "my proposal is to apply information theory to this problem . in more radical sense",
    ", we focus on `` pure information '' or `` minimal information '' of the original quantum critical system that is stored or embedded into a classical memory space .",
    "of course the universality of the original quantum model plays a role on this information . in information - theoretical terminology , the question seems to find an efficient method for data storage or to find data transformation where the information entropy is conserved .",
    "recently , it has been well known that the entanglement entropy is a very powerful tool to know critical and topological behaviors of quantum systems , and many theoretical supports from cft and other techniques have been obtained .",
    "furthermore , the conservation of the total amount of the data is represented by the holographic entanglement entropy  @xcite . by these rich results",
    ", the power of the quantum information theory would be recognized to be very strong . however , the application of another types of information theory to this problem is still limited  @xcite .",
    "thus , we try to open a path for more frexible use of information theory .    in this respect",
    ", it seems to be very efficient to examine geometrical structure of the memory space by based on the relative information entropy  @xcite . as we will introduce the definition , the relative entropy classically measures a difference between two quantum states by comparing between their sets of the reduced - density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "thus , it is not only able to introduce the metric in the memory space , but also connect the original quantum state with the classical memory space .",
    "that is related to the idea of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in addition , overall features of the eigenvalue - oriented quantities ( more specifically entropy - oriented quantities ) at critical points tend to be strongly restricted by the universal scaling relations .",
    "well - known examples are the calabrese - cardy s formula for the entanglement entropy and the finite - entanglement scaling  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to examine what features induce the anti - de sitter metric in the memory space without introducing specific models . the metric is a really crucial factor to determine the potency and the total capacity of the memory space . by naturally following from the underlying properties of the density - matrix eigenvalues ,",
    "the memory space should be a manifold with an appropriate metric in terms of riemaniann geometry . in connection with ads / cft and mera",
    ", a question is whether the ads geometry is automatically derived from the overall features of quantum critical systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "we will find that the relative entropy defined from the eigenvalues of spatially one - dimensional quantum critical states is proportional to the line element of the two - dimensional anti - de sitter space , if we correctly derive the holographic representation of the density - matrix eigenvalues that determine how to distribute the original data into the holographic space .",
    "this correspondence leads to a formula connecting the central charge with the power of algebraic decay of the eigenvalues , and the formula is confirmed by numerical simulations . in order to see the underlying mechanism of these results , we will examine conformal properties of the relative information entropy by complexifying the holographic space .",
    "the standard cft defines a complex coordinate from @xmath3-dimensional spacetime , but in the present case the 2d holographic space is directly complexified .",
    "then , we can compare the ads space with the holographic representation of the eigenvalues on the same framework , and it becomes very clear to know the close relation between the conformal weight and the curvature radius of the ads space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the relative information entropy that is a key quantity to connect the quantum critical systems with the classical gravity theory . sections iii and iv are the main parts of this paper . here",
    ", we examine what type of the density matrix of the quantum theory leads to the ads metric .",
    "in addition , we derive some formula related to the universal entanglement - entropy scaling , and this is confirmed by numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "v , the present theory is complexified in comparison with the standard cft .",
    "then , it would be very clear why the ads / cft appears .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in sec .",
    "vi with some remarks .",
    "technical details related to @xmath4-extension of the relative entropy are summarized in appendix .",
    "in order to connect quantum information with geometric quantities , it is useful to introduce the so - called relative information entropy . the relative entropy measures an abstract distance between two quantum states by their sets of the density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "let us first introduce two sets of the density - matrix eigenvalues of a spatially @xmath0-dimensional model , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the number @xmath7 represents that of the density - matrix eigenstates that play significant role on the physical properties of the corresponding model .",
    "hereafter , we consider that the density matrix is defined for a partial system where the environmental degrees of freedom are traced out . this procedure is necessary in a formal sense , when we consider the ( holographic ) entanglement entropy .",
    "the conservation relation of the total probability is represented by @xmath8 here we assume that @xmath7 is invariant for different quantum states .",
    "even when @xmath9 for @xmath10 , we formally consider the @xmath7 states .",
    "the relative von neumann entropy between them is defined by @xmath11 this is sometimes called the kullback - liebler divergence in information - theory community .",
    "this form is determined so that @xmath12 approaches @xmath13 for @xmath14 and approaches zero for @xmath15 . in appendix , we will present @xmath4-extension of this quantity , @xmath16 , but the essential properties are the same except for an overall factor .",
    "thus , we can start from this quantity without loss of generality .",
    "later , we will see that @xmath12 can be viewed as a metric tensor of the space where the quantum information is stored .",
    "we call this space as the momory space or the information space . soon after we will discuss the physical meaning of the memory space in terms of the density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "let us introduce the difference between @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 where we assume that @xmath20 is a small parameter and @xmath21 we consider that any small difference between @xmath22 and @xmath23 is detectable , when we take a sufficiently large-@xmath7 value .",
    "we expand @xmath12 by the small parameter @xmath20 @xmath24 we find that @xmath12 is always positive , and is an increasing function with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we can regard @xmath12 as a measure of distance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in our information space .",
    "a key ingredient in this study is to consider that the probability distribution function for @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems contains a set of @xmath1 continuous parameters @xmath25 , and the set forms the bases of a @xmath1-dimensional classical space where the quantum information is embedded : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an infinitesimal parameter .",
    "the left hand side of each equation focusing on the index @xmath28 is `` quantum '' representation , while the right hand side focusing on the internal paramaters is `` classical '' one .",
    "the extra dimension @xmath29 controls an energy scale of the original quantum model .",
    "this situation would be more clearly understandable in terms of mera .",
    "the variational wave function of mera is formally represented by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes quantum degree of freedom at site @xmath32 in the original @xmath0-dimensional quantum lattice model , contraction of the tensors @xmath33 forms a network ( mera network , holographic space ) , and each tensor is located at a point @xmath34 in the mera network with the extra degree @xmath29 , and @xmath35 is the number of the tensors which depends on the system size in the original quantum system .",
    "the physical meaning of this trial function is that the original quantum data are decomposed into many smaller degrees of freedom , @xmath33 , and they are embedded into the holographic space with one - higher dimension .",
    "the partial density matrix tracing over environmental degrees of freedom @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 then , the eigenvalue spectrum is obtained from the following eigenvalue equation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the eigenstate of @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the holographic representation of the spectrum indirectly contains information of a set of tensors that are functions of the coodinates @xmath25 .",
    "more specifically , the spectrum should be a functional of the tensor rank @xmath41 in stead of the tensor itself : @xmath42 .",
    "this is because the tensor is non - commutative and still has remnant of quantum fluctuation . in general",
    ", it is reasonable to imagine that the tensor rank is position - dependent in the hologrphic space , if it s able to really optimize the dependence variationally .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the original quantum information of the density - matrix eigenvalues is stored into the classical memory space with the ads metric in an appropriate way .",
    "since the ads space has a radial axis characterizes the energy scale , the data from low - energy ( high - energy ) physics are stored into an ir ( uv ) region of the ads space . in that sense , the data storage would be local with some spatial fluctuation in the memory space .",
    "this remark is important , since the definition of the relative entropy , that will later give the metric , is somehow complicated .",
    "the relative entropy measures the difference between two distributions .",
    "thus , the entropy does not only measure the difference between two point in the memory space , but also detect some fluctuation around these points .",
    "that is the reason why the relative entropy is a sensitive detector of space fluctuation in the present formalism .",
    "let us expand the logarithm of @xmath23 up to the second order as @xmath43 where the einstein s convention is used . multiplying @xmath22 into both sides of eq .",
    "( [ logk ] ) and summing upto all @xmath28 , we finally obtain @xmath44 where we have changed the order of the sum and the derivative as follows : @xmath45 by using the following relation @xmath46 we obtain the following representaton @xmath47 where @xmath48 is fisher s information matrix defined by @xmath49 this is nothing but a metric tensor of our information space in terms of general relativity . here , the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath22 is very important to keep the rank of the matrix @xmath48 , otherwise @xmath50 is represented by a single parameter and the space is ill - defined .",
    "for instance , when we take @xmath51 for any @xmath28 , we find that @xmath52 .",
    "we will later discuss the @xmath28-dependence in detail .",
    "the relative entropy is dimensionless . in order to make our discussion compatible with general relativity ,",
    "we introduce a constant @xmath53 with the dimension of length ( more precisely , @xmath53 corresponds to the newton constant ) .",
    "then , the line element of our information space is given by @xmath54",
    "let us consider geometrical and physical meaning of the metric tensor @xmath48 .",
    "now , we do not have any physical constraint for the structure of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , any type of the metric may be reproduced by the appropriate @xmath22 . here",
    ", we would like to find a physical case in which @xmath48 can be converted into the ads metric given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is curvature radius , and we denote radial axis as @xmath57 . to make our purpose clear",
    ", it is important to state that we would like to determine the holographic representation of @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) as functions of the space coodinates @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "hereafter , we focus on one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems and their corresponding 2d classical systems labeled by the coordinate @xmath60 . in order to find the appropriate @xmath22 that reproduces ads , we first rewrite @xmath22 as @xmath61 where the quantity @xmath62 corresponds to ( the holographic dual of ) the entanglement spectrum . by using the entanglement spectrum ,",
    "the metric is represented as @xmath63 thus , the metric picks up a correlation function associated with the space fluctuation of the spectrum .",
    "next , we expand @xmath62 as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , are constant parameters that depend on @xmath28 . this form is found heuristically so that we can make @xmath69 after the derivative by @xmath2 and @xmath64 .",
    "we will later discuss more sophisticated treatement .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ metric2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath70 we find that the metric becomes ads for @xmath71 , if @xmath68 is independent of @xmath28 ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . then , @xmath22 is transformed into the following form : @xmath75 here @xmath76 should be a positive - definite parameter , if taking the large-@xmath2 limit corresponds to finding a rg fixed point and @xmath22 becomes much smaller due to the condition @xmath77 for this limit .",
    "the holographic representation of @xmath22 seems to be very suggestive in view of entanglement entropy scaling . according to the ryu - takayanagi s ( rt ) formula for the holographic entanglement entropy  @xcite ,",
    "the original quantum data are decomposed into a set of data with different length scales , and each of them is embedded into different layers of the ads space . in those cases ,",
    "the entropy is derived by calculating the geodesic minimal length connecting two end points of a partial system with length @xmath78 in the original quantum system .",
    "then , each layer behaves as a rather classical system .",
    "then , the total holographic entropy can be obtained by summing up all of contributions from each layer , but the entropy in each layer strictly satisfies the area law scaling that is required for gapped systems .",
    "our resulting eq .",
    "( [ lambda1 ] ) clearly shows this feature : @xmath22 shows exponential decay for the spatial coodinate @xmath64 , although the coefficient @xmath66 changes the sign in order to satisfy the condition @xmath74 .",
    "this suggests that each holographic layer is gapped , since the correlation functions are roughly proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "remember that the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath22 is necessary so that the information space is well defined .",
    "let us move to determine the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath22 . at quantum criticality",
    ", it has been well known that @xmath22 decays algebraically as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "thus , we take @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and then @xmath81 combining this with @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 this relation implicitly defines @xmath64 and @xmath2 dependences of @xmath7 , and thus means how the original quantum degrees of freedom are distributed into the holographic space .",
    "that s why we start from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) on the basis of the mera network .",
    "we denote @xmath84 , and @xmath85 becomes the riemann s zeta function in the large-@xmath7 limit , @xmath86 .",
    "this function diverges at @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , the divergence of the second term should be weaker than that of @xmath85 even without the small prefactor @xmath88 , since @xmath66 has both plus and minus signs due to the presence of the constraint @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the leading term is the first one .",
    "we may proceed more extensive analysis based on the dirichlet-@xmath78 function @xmath89 and the euler product formula , if it is able to determine @xmath66 as a totally multiplicative function . by using the euler - maclaurin s sum formula ,",

    "for this purpose , we introduce the holographic entanglement entropy given by @xmath96 where we have substituted eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ lambda1 ] ) into the first and the second lines of the above equations , respectively .",
    "it is easy to find @xmath97 which characterizes rg flow , since @xmath2 controls the energy scale in the original quantum system  @xcite . for large-@xmath7 values and for @xmath71 , eq .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) and examine how to determine @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we represent @xmath170 with use of two real variables @xmath182 and @xmath183 as @xmath184 and we take @xmath185 and @xmath186 then , we find @xmath187 in general , the first term remains .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath188 in the ir limit @xmath189 , this leads to the ads metric @xmath190 where we have assumed @xmath191    in the ir limit , the logarithmic function is expanded into the following form : @xmath192 then , @xmath167 is represented as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is an odd integer .",
    "therefore , this is really equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) with use of the notations @xmath195 we also know that the condition @xmath196 corresponds to @xmath74",
    ". then , all of the assumptions given by eqs .",
    "( [ as1 ] ) , ( [ as2 ] ) and ( [ as3 ] ) are completely the same as those in the main sections in this paper .",
    "finally , the scaling dimension is given by @xmath197 this would be closely related to the brown - henneaux s formula where the curvature radius of the ads space is proportional to the central charge  @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we have taken the ir limit @xmath189 to compare the results with eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "more sophisticated treatment is possible by introducing the full laurent - mode expansion given by @xmath198 where @xmath170 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is replaced to @xmath199 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath200 and their inverse transformations are given by @xmath201 where the integral path @xmath202 is a closed loop that surrounds the origin of the complex plane .    in the standard notation of cft , the stress - energy tensor ( we ignore the index @xmath28 ) is expanded as @xmath203 thus , eqs .",
    "( [ dg1 ] ) and ( [ dg2 ] ) may be replaced to the stress - energy tensor @xmath204 and its complex conjugate @xmath205 as @xmath206 although there might be some ambiguities for the method of changing the power of @xmath207 by one .",
    "if this procedure is correct , the second derivative of the metric tensor is important .",
    "actually , we have @xmath208 this behavior strongly reminds us the stress - energy correlation function in the standard cft .",
    "this would be very important connection between the cft and the emergent ads space .",
    "in the present case , instead of the virasoro algebra and the conformal tower structure , we will see that the expectation values between a holomorphic mode and its corresponding anti - holomorphic mode play important roles on the conformal structure and the emergent metric .",
    "first , it is clear that the expectation value of single coefficient is zero .",
    "actually @xmath209 and from eq .  ( [ dg1 ] )",
    "this requires @xmath210 for all @xmath56 .",
    "next , we consider the relation between the metric and the correlation between two raurent modes . by using the laurent - expansion coefficients ,",
    "each component of the metric is represented as @xmath211 and @xmath212 the inverse transformation for the last one is given by @xmath213 where we can take the path @xmath214 that is generally different from @xmath202 . clearly , @xmath215 in definitions of @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "when we introduce the inverse transformation of @xmath216 , we must take care about the power of @xmath207 : @xmath218 where the sum runs over the partial region of @xmath219 given by @xmath220 .",
    "we would like to find the conditions in which @xmath221 becomes the exact ads metric .",
    "the denominator of the ads metric in eq .",
    "( [ metricimw ] ) is @xmath222 and this is not a good representation in view of complex analysis . by based on the condition @xmath223",
    ", we expand the ads metric as follows : @xmath224 and then we take @xmath225 . after this procedure ,",
    "the metric is decomposed into the sum of the product between holomolphic and anti - holomorphic parts .",
    "the first term in the last line , @xmath226 , has been already derived from the logarithmic terms of @xmath167 in eq .",
    "( [ gammafull ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we examine a role of the higher - order terms of the raurent modes on the precise determination of the ads metric .",
    "let us first examine @xmath227 . taking a condition @xmath228 in eq .",
    "( [ hkhl ] ) , we find that @xmath229 where @xmath230 is a binomial coefficient .",
    "we see that the prefactor @xmath231 appears after correcting all of the higher - order terms in eq .",
    "( [ adsw ] ) .",
    "the convergency of this infinite series is very slow , but i have numerically confirmed that the sum is still @xmath232 for a very large value @xmath233 .",
    "the modification of @xmath76 due to the presence of this prefactor is given by the root of this factor , and thus we need not to worry about the divergence .",
    "practically , we will introduce a cut - off in the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ adsw ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we easily confirm that @xmath234 vanishes for @xmath235 .",
    "thus , the remaining work is to evaluate @xmath236 .",
    "the result is following : @xmath237 this is finite for the following conditions @xmath238 and the solution is @xmath239 in this case , @xmath236 is given by @xmath240 this result contains eq .",
    "( [ h0h0 ] ) .",
    "this quantity is invariant under the sign change in the index @xmath56 , since @xmath241 : @xmath242 we observe that the components with small @xmath56 variables play significant roles on the laurent expansion , but the higher - order terms are still important for quantitative analysis .",
    "thus , the full laurent - mode expansion is necessary in order to recover the conformal symmetry of the exact ads metric .    before closing this section , eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) is generalized as follows .",
    "the square of the scale dimension is given by @xmath243 thus , the expectation value of this equation is @xmath244 then , we obtain @xmath245",
    "summarizing , we have found rich physical aspects behind the relative information metric ( the fisher information metric ) , when we focus on the information - geometrical understanding of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the relative entropy for one - dimensional quantum critical states is proportional to the line element of the two - dimensional anti - de sitter space , if we correctly derive the holographic representation of the density - matrix eigenvalues .",
    "the holographic representation determines how to distribute the original quantum data into the holographic space .",
    "this correspondence leads to a formula connecting the central charge with the power of algebraic decay of the eigenvalues , and the formula is confirmed by dmrg and monte carlo simulations .",
    "complexification of the holographic space provides us a unified viewpoint of the present results . in the standard cft ,",
    "the complex plane is spanned by space and time coodinates , while in the present case the holographic space is directly complexified .",
    "then , the dimension of the ads space is equivalent to that of the complex analysis of the holographic space , and we directly know the relation between the curvature radius @xmath56 of ads and the conformal weight @xmath181 .",
    "this is a core factor of the physics of ads / cft and mera in an information - theoretical viewpoint .",
    "the extention of the present method to higher - dimensional cases is one of on - going works along the present result .",
    "a preliminary calculation shows that the method can be applied to 4d memory space by replacing complex valiables into quaternions .",
    "the leading order reproduces the ads metric , but some additional terms come from non - commutativity between two quaternions . with respect to the super yang - mills theory ,",
    "this is an interesting question whether the supersymmetry eliminates the additional terms .",
    "finally , i am very interested in the physical meaning of the einstein tensor @xmath246 of the information space for general metric cases ( in the case of ads , @xmath247 should be zero with a negative cosmological constant @xmath18 ) .",
    "the fisher information metric was related to the correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus , we also expect that @xmath247 has also some physical meaning .",
    "we may discuss close connection among information theory , thermodynamics , and general relativity .",

    "this entropy approaches the von neumann entropy in the @xmath251 limit @xmath252 it has been extensively examined that the @xmath4-deformed statistical distribution appears in many complex systems  @xcite .",
    "the tsallis entropy comes from thermally equillibrium state where a partial system is combined with environment with heat capacity @xmath253  @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath254 saturates at the value @xmath253 for @xmath255 if we take @xmath77 .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath4 controls how efficiently the environment works as a heat bath .",
    "since the partial system can not reach at thermal equillibrium instantaneously , it is hard to access all of the physical states in our phase space .",
    "that is the origin for nonergodicity and metastable states of complex systems . in other words",
    ", @xmath4 changes the amount of thermal fluctuation between the system and the environment , and then we see various coarse - grained systems labeled by @xmath4 .",
    "such a function of the nonextensive parameter @xmath4 may have some correspondence to the extra dimension of the ads space .",

    "the scaling properties of the fractal would be closely related to the conformal invariance in cft .",
    "complexity is in some sense complementary to the presence of scaling properties , since the complexity itself is originated from strong competition between states with various energy and length scales .",
