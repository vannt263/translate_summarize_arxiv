    "during the last decade , space - based and terrestrial astronomy have revolutionized our understanding of the high-@xmath0 universe ( redshift @xmath1 ) .",
    "astronomers can now observe the high-@xmath0 universe in many bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and have begun putting upper limits on the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "their telescopes and detectors have provided a direct probe of cataclysmic transient astrophysical phenomena that are rare in our local universe but occur at high rates on a cosmological scale .",
    "for example , optical observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ) , are used as tools to constrain the cosmological model that best describes our universe .",
    "their uniformity in luminosity means they can be used as standard candles for determining cosmological distances . recently",
    "23 high-@xmath0 type ia sne , including 15 at @xmath2 were used as a cosmic ruler to show that the universe is accelerating and has cosmological parameters consistent with spatial flatness @xcite .",
    "the high - energy signature of one class of event occurs in the gamma - ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum : cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are extremely energetic transient events and their fluence ( time - integrated flux ) and time variability show that their power sources must be compact .",
    "at least a fraction of grbs are associated with massive and short - lived progenitor stars , implying that either a neutron star or black hole must be driving the emissions .",
    "recent estimates suggest that the universal cosmological grb rate could be as high as one per minute @xcite .",
    "we adopt these definitions : an _ event _ is a cataclysmic astrophysical transient occurrence , such as a core - collapse sn or a grb , with a duration much less than the observation period ; an _ observer _ records event times and redshifts , obtained as data from a flux - limited detector sensitive to high-@xmath0 events .    with the launch of the _ swift _ satellite ( on 2004 november 20 ) , a multi - wavelength grb observatory ( http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) , up",
    "to 1000 grbs are expected to be detected in 3 years as a result of a sensitivity limit 5 times fainter than that of batse ( the burst and transient source experiment that was aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ) .",
    "the _ swift _ mission has the potential to localize about one grb per day , providing the possibility of cataloging hundreds of grb redshifts .",
    "predicting the rates of transient astrophysical events , such as grbs , is fundamental to detector design and planning realistic science goals .",
    "an understanding of the probability of achieving those goals is correlated with the probability of acquiring a useful sample of events .",
    "the ` ultimate detector ' would be sensitive enough to detect all events out to the redshift where the events of the relevent type first started .",
    "for example , determining the event rate for grbs as a function of @xmath0 would ideally require detectors with all - sky coverage and extraordinary sensitivity .",
    "in addition , selection effects plague many high-@xmath0 observations .    with continuing technical improvements to astronomical instrumentation ,",
    "it is conceivable that the observed rates of grbs will approach the theoretical limit in the future .",
    "but for the present , all astronomical detectors probe only a fraction of the total volume encompassing all possible events . for any astronomical detector and source type , one can define a ` detectability horizon ' centred on the detector and encompassing the volume in which such events are potentially detectable ; the horizon distance is determined by the flux limit of the detector and the source flux .",
    "a second horizon , defined by the minimum distance for at least one event to occur over some observation time , with probability above some selected threshold , can also be defined .",
    "we call this the ` probability event horizon ' ( peh ) .",
    "it describes how an observer and all potentially detectable cosmological events of a particular type are related via a probability event distribution encompassing all such events .",
    "to illustrate the idea , we first show how a peh can be defined in the simple case of a static euclidean universe , assuming an isotropic and homogenous distribution of events . for a constant event rate @xmath3 per unit volume ,",
    "the mean cumulative event rate in a volume of radius @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the events are independent of each other , so their distribution is a poisson process in time : the probability for at least one event to occur in this volume during observation time @xmath6 at a mean rate @xmath7 at constant probability @xmath8 is given by an exponential distribution : @xmath9 @xmath10 being the probability of zero events occurring .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) to remain satisfied as @xmath6 increases , the mean number of events in this volume , @xmath11 , must remain constant . the corresponding radial distance , a decreasing function of observation time , defines the peh : @xmath12 the speed at which the horizon approaches the observer  the peh velocity  is obtained by differentiating @xmath13 with respect to @xmath6 : @xmath14    in practice , we ll take @xmath15 , corresponding to a 95% probability of observing at least one event within distance @xmath4 , and so @xmath16 is the mean number of events . note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the choice of @xmath8 through @xmath19 : if @xmath20 is chosen , @xmath21 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be bigger by a factor of 3 than for @xmath22 .",
    "if we consider event rates in volumes of cosmological scale , @xmath23 can be very much greater than the speed of light . for neutron star formation , @xmath24 s@xmath25 mpc@xmath26 in the nearby universe ( coward , burman & blair 2001 , section 2.1 ) . taking this value and solving eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) for @xmath6 with @xmath27 mpc s@xmath25 and @xmath15 , we find that about @xmath28 years of observation time elapse before @xmath23 drops below @xmath29 .",
    "the horizon would then be about 0.2 mpc from the observer , but the assumption of homogeneity breaks down for distances less than a few tens of mpc .",
    "after one year of observation , the peh would be 30 mpc from the observer , which is about the distance within which we would expect fluctuations in @xmath7 resulting from the local distribution of galaxies to dominate ; @xmath23 at this distance is about 2 pc s@xmath25 .",
    "to extend the peh model to a friedmann cosmology requires modifying the simple euclidean model to incorporate cosmic evolution .",
    "the expansion of the universe is described by the evolving hubble parameter @xmath30 , which can be expressed in terms of the contributions of matter and vacuum energy @xcite : @xmath31^{1/2}\\ ] ] for a ` flat-@xmath32 ' cosmology ( a spatially flat cosmology with cosmological constant ) .",
    "the comoving radial ( line - of - sight ) distance is obtained from @xmath33 by @xmath34 this corresponds to integrating elements of comoving distance  ones that remain constant with epoch for neighbouring objects moving with the hubble flow  and is the appropriate distance measure for structures locked to the hubble flow @xcite .    the luminosity distance , @xmath35 : defined so that the inverse - square law of intensity applies , it can be measured by means of ` standard candles ' .",

    "neutron star ( ns ) births result from massive short - lived progenitor stars and there is mounting evidence that grbs do so too , so both types of events should closely track the evolving star formation rate ( sfr ) .",

    "<S> suppose an astronomer is equipped with a device capable of detecting emissions  whether they be electromagnetic , gravitational , or neutrino  from transient sources distributed throughout the cosmos . because of source rate density evolution and variation of cosmological volume elements , the sources first detected when the machine is switched on are likely to be ones in the high - redshift universe ; as observation time increases , rarer , more local , events will be found . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the observer s evolving record of events in terms of a ` probability event horizon ' , converging on the observer from great distances at enormous speed , and illustrate it by simulating neutron star birth events distributed throughout the cosmos . as an initial application of the concept , we determine the approach of this horizon for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by fitting to redshift data . the event rates required to fit the model are consistent with the proposed link between core - collapse supernovae and a largely undetected population of faint grbs .    </S>",
