    "the latter is exemplified by a spinning black hole or neutron star . in this way",
    "we generalize the picture of the evolution of a system consisting of a black hole and a test particle , which we considered in * i*. the equations of motion and the spin precession equations valid to the ( post@xmath14-newtonian order are reviewed in the second section .",
    "the constants of motion are the energy @xmath4 and the total angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "since our goal is to get the radiation losses up to the leading terms in the spin , we approximately picture the spin precession by a rigid paralelogram with sides @xmath1 and @xmath16 , rotating about the total angular momentum vector @xmath15 . in this approach",
    "the magnitude @xmath1 and the spin projection @xmath17 of the orbital angular momentum are constants of the motion . from their expressions",
    "an uncoupled radial equation can be found .    in the third section",

    "we then introduce two parameters , the eccentric anomaly and the true anomaly. they have the respective properties , and in the no - spin limit reduce to , the eccentric anomaly and true anomaly of kepler orbits .",
    "the parametrization of the orbit by the eccentric anomaly enables one to compute the orbital period defined as twice the period of time elapsed between consecutive turning points .    in the fourth section ,",

    "these considerations enable us to compute the loss of magnitude and spin projection of the orbital angular momentum . however the latter will still contain radiative spin loss terms , which are evaluated from the burke - thorne potential .",
    "fortunately , introducing suitable new angular variables , all losses can be expressed in terms of the true anomaly parameter alone .    in the fifth section we average these expressions by using the residue theorem .",
    "we find that the spin - loss terms give no averaged contribution to the losses .",
    "the finite - mass backreaction effects are of the same order as the other spin effects .",
    "the results obtained in the lense - thirring case emerge as smooth limits , although the test particle case is outside the framework of this paper .",

    "since we are interested in the leading spin terms of the gravitational radiation backreaction losses , we may replace @xmath55 by inserting terms of higher order in @xmath16 .",
    "this is allowed , as we are neglecting terms of order @xmath56 in the precessional angular velocity , which are @xmath57 order higher then the spin terms that we have kept .",
