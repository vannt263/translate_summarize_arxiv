    "the seminal experiments on electricity and magnetism in the @xmath1@xmath2 centuries were codified into a set of physical laws , gauss s law , ampre s law , faraday s law , and thompson s law , that form the foundation of early classical electromagnetism .",
    "in the course of time , a crisis emerged when it was determined that ampre s law is not consistent with the continuity equation for charge and current . in 1865 , maxwell @xcite proposed a modification to ampre s law that resolved the inconsistency and established a new paradigm for electrodynamics that led to the prediction of electromagnetic wave phenomena . over two decades later , hertz @xcite demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves , providing experimental validation for the maxwell theory . with the replacement of ampre s law by the maxwell  ampre law , the collective laws of classical electrodynamics are known as maxwell s equations , appearing in a microscopic formulation that applies to microscopic fields in the vacuum and in a macroscopic formulation as equations of motion for averaged fields in continuous media .",
    "the maxwell equations for the components of the fields were recast as vector equations by heaviside and by minkowski . the maxwell ",
    "minkowski equations are the dominant paradigms of microscopic classical electrodynamics and of macroscopic classical continuum electrodynamics . for over fifteen decades ,",
    "maxwellian continuum electrodynamics has been extraordinarily successful in predicting and describing real - world phenomena that occur in dielectric materials .",
    "there are , however , anomalies .",
    "the anomalies include the abraham  minkowski momentum controversy @xcite and rosen s refractive index - dependent special theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that the macroscopic maxwell  minkowski equations are inconsistent with conservation of total momentum : that is the origin story of the century - old abraham  minkowski controversy @xcite .",
    "the difference between the total momentum , which is decided by temporal invariance of the total momentum in a thermodynamically closed system , and the electromagnetic momentum that is systematically derived from the macroscopic maxwell - minkowski equations has generally been attributed to the existence of a material momentum that is associated with the movement of matter in either a macroscopic or a microscopic picture of the dielectric @xcite .",
    "while the physical origin and characteristics of the phenomenological material momentum have been debated for decades , experimental demonstrations of a material momentum has been variously inconsistent , contradictory , and refuted @xcite likewise , theoretical treatments of the abraham  minkowski controversy @xcite have not provided a conclusive consistent physical solution . in 2007 ,",
    "pfeifer , nieminen , heckenberg , and rubinsztein - dunlop @xcite reviewed the state of the field and concluded that the issue had been settled for some time : `` when the appropriate accompanying energy  momentum tensor for the material medium is also considered , experimental predictions of the various proposed tensors will always be the same , and the preferred form is therefore effectively a matter of personal choice . '' in 2010 , barnett @xcite offered a more restrictive resolution of the abraham  minkowski conundrum by contending that the total momentum for the medium and the field is composed of either the minkowski canonical momentum or the abraham kinetic momentum , each supplemented by the appropriate canonical or kinetic material momentum .    according to the scientific method , a scientific hypothesis should result in a unique testable prediction of physical quantities .",
    "there are many examples in the extant experimental record in which the interpretation of momentum experiments is unrestricted with experiments that prove the minkowski electromagnetic momentum later being shown to prove the abraham electromagnetic momentum and vice versa @xcite .",
    "likewise , experiments that disprove the minkowski momentum are later re - analyzed to confirm the minkowski momentum and similarly for the abraham momentum @xcite .",
    "although the barnett @xcite and pfeifer , nieminen , henckenberg , and rubinsztein - dunlop @xcite theories are based on fundamental principles , barnett s restriction to two simultaneous physically motivated momentums is not compatible with the mathematical tautology that underlies pfeifer , _",
    "et al_. the non - uniqueness of the electromagnetic momentum and the non - uniqueness of the material momentum that are derived for the propagation of light through a dielectric are contrary to popper s criterion of falsifiability .    in a thermodynamically closed system ,",
    "the total momentum , like the total energy , is a known quantity that is uniquely determined by temporal invariance .",
    "then the construction of the unique total energy  momentum tensor gets us right with the scientific method and definitively resolves the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy .",
    "except that there are problems here , too . applying the four - divergence operator to the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor , one obtains conservation laws for the total energy and the total linear momentum of an antireflection - coated simple linear medium that is positioned in free space @xcite .",
    "it is easily argued that the conservation law for the total energy , so obtained , can not be incommensurate with the poynting theorem that is systematically derived from the maxwell field equations .",
    "it is also easily proven that _ i _ )",
    "the energy conservation law , derived from the four - divergence of the total energy  momentum tensor , is self - inconsistent because its two non - zero terms depend on different powers of the refractive index and _ ii _ ) the conservation law for the total energy that is derived from the four - divergence of the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor is undeniably incommensurate with the poynting theorem @xcite .",
    "the current author @xcite made the _",
    "ansatz _ of a ravndal @xcite refractive index - dependent material four - divergence operator and demonstrated consistency between the field equations and total energy ",
    "momentum conservation , at the cost of apparent problems with special relativity .",
    "then we have fixed the abraham  minkowski momentum problem only to have it re - appear in a different form elsewhere .",
    "we must go deeper into the relations between electrodynamics , conservation , and special relativity in a simple linear dielectric medium in order to obtain any meaningful resolution of the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy .",
    "classical continuum electrodynamics can be treated as a formal system in which the macroscopic maxwell  minkowski equations and the constitutive relations are the axioms .",
    "theorems are derived from the axioms using algebra and calculus .",
    "poynting s theorem of energy continuity is one example of a theorem of axiomatic continuum electrodynamics as is the continuity equation for the minkowski momentum .",
    "the scalar energy continuity equation and the scalar component equations of the vector minkowski momentum continuity equation can be written using linear algebra as a single matrix differential equation that is a valid theorem within the formal system of maxwellian continuum electrodynamics .    in this article",
    ", we derive valid theorems of the formal theory of maxwellian continuum electrodynamics from explicitly stated axioms using simple substitutions of explicitly defined quantities ; there are no implicit axioms and no manifest deficiencies in the derivations . noting that conservation laws , special relativity , and the maxwell field equations are distinct laws of physics , we show that valid theorems of maxwellian continuum electrodynamics are proven false by the energy ",
    "momentum conservation laws for an unimpeded , inviscid , incompressible continuous flow of non - interacting particles , photons .",
    "we also show that valid theorems of the formal theory of maxwellian continuum electrodynamics are proven false by von laue s application of the einstein theory of special relativity to a dielectric . when a valid theorem of an axiomatic formal theory is proven false by an accepted standard",
    ", then it is proven that one or more axioms of the formal theory are false .",
    "alternatively the standard with which the theorem is being compared is false , or both the theory and the standard can be simultaneously false . therefore",
    ", the extant theoretical treatments of energy  momentum conservation , special relativity , and continuum electrodynamics must be regarded as being mutually inconsistent in a region of space in which the effective speed of light is @xmath0 .",
    "this is a _ significant result of this article _ and it was clearly presaged by the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy @xcite and by the contradiction between the von laue @xcite and rosen @xcite treatments of special relativity in a dielectric .",
    "having proven the existing theories to be inconsistent , it is customary to propose alternatives . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the field and dielectric are continuous at all length scales .",
    "we define an isotropic , homogenous , absorptionless , linear dielectric - filled , flat , non - minkowski , continuous material spacetime @xmath3 , where the time - like coordinate @xmath4 is identified with @xmath5 . in this spacetime ,",
    "the basis functions of propagating electromagnetic fields @xmath6 are what we would expect for monochromatic , or quasimonochromatic , fields propagating at speed @xmath0 in a simple linear dielectric , instead of @xmath7 that are the basis functions of maxwellian electrodynamics .",
    "consequently , there is a fundamental difference between an organically continuum - based electrodynamics and microscopic fields interacting with individual particles in the vacuum .",
    "as in statistical and thermal physics , the macroscopic model and the microscopic model are fundamentally disjoint : the assumptions , approximations , and averages that are implicit in the macroscopic model are not reversible .",
    "we apply lagrangian field theory in the isotropic , homogeneous , linear dielectric - filled , flat , non - minkowski , continuous material spacetime @xmath3 to systematically and rigorously derive equations of motion for macroscopic fields in a simple linear dielectric .",
    "these equations of motion are the axioms of a new formal theory of continuum electrodynamics .",
    "there is sufficient commonality between the new equations of motion and the macroscopic maxwell ",
    "minkowski equations that the extensive theoretical and experimental work that is correctly described by the macroscopic maxwell ",
    "minkowski equations has an equivalent formulation in the new theory .",
    "in particular , the wave equation has the same form in both versions of continuum electrodynamics .",
    "more interesting is the work that we can do with the new formalism of continuum electrodynamics in a thermodynamically closed system that is improperly posed in the standard maxwell theory of continuum electrodynamics .",
    "these cases will typically involve the invariance or tensor properties of the set of coupled equations of motion for the macroscopic fields .",
    "this interpretation is borne out in our common experience : the macroscopic maxwell ",
    "minkowski equations produce exceedingly accurate experimentally verified predictions of simple phenomena like reflection , refraction , wave velocity , _ etc .",
    "_ , but fail to render a unique , uncontroversial , verifiable prediction of energy  momentum conservation .",
    "conservation laws are distinct from the energy ",
    "momentum evolution theorems that are systematically derived from the maxwell field equations . in continuum dynamics , the continuity equations , often called conservation laws , are derived for the case an unimpeded , inviscid , incompressible continuous flow of non - interacting particles ( dust , fluid , photons , _ etc .",
    "_ ) in an otherwise empty volume @xcite . applying the divergence theorem to a taylor series expansion of a density field of a conserved property in an empty minkowski spacetime results in a continuity equation for the conserved property .",
    "we show that applying the same derivation procedure to a non - empty , linear dielectric - filled , isotropic , homogeneous , flat , non - minkowski , continuous material spacetime produces a continuity equation for a conserved property of a simple linear dielectric that requires differentiation with respect to the independent variable @xmath4 , which is identified with @xmath5 , instead of @xmath8 .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the fact that the photon fluid is not incompressible : there is a change in energy density , and a corresponding change in photon density , as the field crosses the interface between the vacuum and a simple linear dielectric .",
    "we then construct the diagonally symmetric , traceless total energy  momentum tensor as an element of a valid theorem of the new formal theory of continuum electrodynamics .",
    "we demonstrate that the spatial integrals of the total energy density and the total momentum density are temporally invariant and that valid theorems of the new formal theory correspond to continuity equations for the conserved properties in a non - empty , dielectric - filled spacetime .",
    "the tensor properties of the new formulation of continuum electrodynamics constitute a definitive resolution of the abraham  minkowski dilemma . the unique total energy ",
    "momentum tensor that is derived by the new formal theory is entirely electromagnetic in nature .",
    "consequently , there is no need to assume any `` splitting '' of the total energy , the total momentum , or the total angular momentum into field and matter subsystems in order to satisfy the energy ",
    "momentum conservation laws for a simple linear dielectric : _ i _ ) in the case of quasimonochromatic optical radiation incident on a stationary homogeneous simple linear dielectric draped with a gradient - index antireflection coating , the surface forces are negligible .",
    "then , the total energy , the total linear momentum , and the total angular momentum are purely electromagnetic and the dielectric remains internally and externally stationary .",
    "_ ii _ ) in the absence of an antireflection coating , the dielectric block acquires momentum due to the optically induced surface pressure that is associated with fresnel reflection and this will be treated by boundary conditions , not by a hypothetical internal material momentum , in a separate publication .",
    "special relativity is the remaining issue on our list of three theories that are mutually inconsistent in a dielectric , the other two being macroscopic electrodynamics and conservation laws .",
    "einstein s theory of special relativity was derived using coordinate transformations between inertial coordinate systems in an infinite vacuum spacetime .",
    "we can , in principle , start with einstein s theory of relativity for microscopic particles in an infinite vacuum spacetime , as a fundamental basis , and describe the interaction of each particle of the material with every other particle and describe how the interaction of every particle with the microscopic field affects the propagation of a light signal .",
    "if we were even capable of such a monumental task , we would then justify some assumptions about limiting behavior and make some approximations and averages that would allow an effective macroscopic description of the full microscopic treatment .",
    "typically , the process will invoke the continuum limit , evaluating discrete sums by integrals and extending the region of integration to spatial infinity @xcite . here , we derive a theory of relativity based on the propagation of a light signal in an infinite , isotropic , homogeneous , continuous dielectric spacetime in which the speed of light is @xmath0 and make a very reasonable assumption that the theory holds for the large finite material spacetime that is a model for a simple linear dielectric .",
    "the result confirms rosen s @xcite phenomenological index - dependent lorentz factor .",
    "this result is consistent with the symmetry of the new equations of motion that are derived from first principles for macroscopic fields in a dielectric - filled spacetime .",
    "we also show how the macroscopic rosen theory of dielectric special relativity can be related to the von laue theory of dielectric special relativity that is based on einstein s theory of special relativity in a vacuum .",
    "the mutually consistent alternative formulations of three connected physical principles , relativity , conservation , and electrodynamics , in a dielectric medium that is represented by a continuous , linear dielectric - filled , flat , non - minkowski material spacetime allows a self - consistent , fully macroscopic , fully electromagnetic resolution of the abraham ",

    "the center - of - energy velocity of the field slows to @xmath307 . invoking the einstein mass  energy equivalence ,",
    "it is argued in the scientific literature @xcite that some microscopic constituents of the dielectric must be accelerated and then decelerated by the field ; otherwise the theorem that the center of mass  energy moves at a constant velocity is violated . for a distribution of particles of mass @xmath308 and velocity @xmath309 ,",
    "the total momentum @xmath310 is the sum of the momentums of all the particles @xmath311 in the distribution .",
    "if the mass of each particle @xmath308 is constant , the statement that the velocity of the center of mass @xmath312 is constant is a statement of conservation of total momentum .",
    "we know from section iii that the momentum , eq .",
    "( [ eqt7.04 ] ) , is temporally invariant even though the center - of - energy travels at speed @xmath0 in the dielectric .",
    "because of the enhanced momentum density of the field in a dielectric , the differential electromagnetic momentum @xmath313 that is contained in an element of volume @xmath314 is a factor of @xmath77 greater than in the vacuum . for a finite pulse , the narrower pulse width and enhanced momentum density offset allowing the electromagnetic momentum to be invariant in time as the field enters , and exits , the dielectric through the gradient - index antireflection coating .",
    "consequently , there is no need to hypothesize any motion of the material constituents of the dielectric to preserve conservation of momentum .",
    "one of the enduring questions of the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy is why the minkowski momentum is so often measured experimentally while the abraham form of momentum seems to be so favored in theoretical work .",
    "we now have the tools to answer that question .",
    "the minkowski momentum is not measured directly , but inferred from a measured index dependence of the optical force on a mirror placed in a dielectric fluid @xcite . because the field is completely reflected at the mirror , the force on the mirror is @xmath315 the measured force on the mirror is directly proportional to the refractive index @xmath77 of the fluid @xcite in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eqt7.08 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we were to assume @xmath316 , which is the relation between momentum and force in an otherwise empty spacetime , then we can write eq .",
    "( [ eqt7.08 ] ) as @xmath317 then one might infer from eq .",
    "( [ eqt7.09 ] ) that the momentum of the field in the dielectric fluid is the minkowski momentum .",
    "instead , we see that the electromagnetic momentum that is obtained from an experiment that measures the optical force on a mirror depends on the theory that is used to interpret the results .",
    "however , based on the changes to continuum electrodynamics that are necessitated by conservation of energy and momentum by the propagation of light in a continuous medium , we find that eq .",
    "( [ eqt7.08 ] ) is the correct relation between the force on the mirror and the momentum of the field in a dielectric .",
    "in this article , we treated maxwellian continuum electrodynamics as an axiomatic formal theory and showed that valid theorems of the formal theory are contradicted by conservation laws and showed that valid theorems of the formal theory are contradicted by special relativity .",
    "axiomatic formal theory is a cornerstone of abstract mathematics and the contradiction of valid theorems of maxwellian continuum electrodynamics by other fundamental laws of physics proves , unambiguously , that continuum electrodynamics , special relativity , and energy",
    " momentum conservation laws , as currently applied to dielectrics , are mutually inconsistent .",
    "we then established a rigorous basis for a reformulation of theoretical continuum electrodynamics by deriving equations of motion for the macroscopic fields from lagrangian field theory adapted for a dielectric - filled spacetime .",
    "we reformulated the conservation laws , which were originally derived for the case of an unimpeded inviscid incompressible flow of non - interacting particles ( dust , fluid , etc . ) in the continuum limit in an otherwise empty volume , for the continuous flow of photons in a dielectric - filled volume .",
    "we used coordinate transformations between inertial reference frames in a dielectric - filled volume to derive a theory of dielectric special relativity .",
    "the reformulated versions of continuum electrodynamics , special relativity , and energy ",
    "momentum conservation laws are mutually consistent in a dielectric - filled volume .",
    "we used the new theory to provide a lucid re - interpretation of the balazs thought experiment and the jones ",
    "richards experiment for the electromagnetic momentum in a dielectric medium .",
    "the abraham ",
    "minkowski controversy is trivially resolved because the tensor total energy  momentum continuity theorem , the total energy  momentum tensor , the total momentum , and the total energy are fully electromagnetic and unique for a thermodynamically closed system consisting of a simple linear dielectric block draped with a gradient - index antireflection coating illuminated by quasimonochromatic light .",
