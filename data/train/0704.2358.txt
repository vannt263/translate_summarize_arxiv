    "when a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor ( s ) are brought together , their mutual interaction results in the modification of their electronic and transport properties .",
    "in particular , the normal metal may acquire genuine superconducting properties such a gap in the density of states or the ability to sustain a supercurrent .",
    "this effect , known as _ proximity effect _",
    ", was first discussed by de gennes  @xcite in the 1960 s and in recent years it has been extensively studied in diffusive hybrid nanostructures .",
    "@xcite many equilibrium  @xcite and transport properties  @xcite of diffusive sn systems are now well understood , which is partially due to the impressive predictive power of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity for diffusive systems , which is summarized in the usadel equations .",
    "@xcite    the proximity effect is mediated by andreev reflections .",
    "@xcite in this tunneling process an electron coming from n with energy @xmath0 below the superconducting gap @xmath1 is converted into a reflected hole , thus transferring a cooper pair to the s electrode .",
    "the time - reversed states involved in this process are coherent over a distance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the diffusion constant of n and @xmath4 is the phase coherence length .",
    "this coherence may also be altered by interactions that break the time - reversal symmetry such as those induced by paramagnetic impurities or an external magnetic field .    in this work we present a theoretical study of the density of states and the supercurent in diffusive sns junctions .",
    "these quantities nicely reflect the proximity effect under equilibrium conditions .",
    "it was first shown by mcmillan  @xcite that a diffusive normal metal in contact with a superconductor can develop a gap in its electronic spectrum , which is usually referred to as _ minigap_. more recently the minigap has been studied by numerous authors , usually within the framework of the usadel equations .",
    "@xcite from the experimental point of view , the appearance of a minigap has been tested indirectly in several tunneling experiments ( see for instance refs .",
    "[ ] an references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that a sns junction can sustain a supercurrent is known since the first experiments performed with pb - cu - pb sandwiches .",
    "@xcite it was soon realized that the existence of a dissipationless current in these structures is possible due to the proximity effect .",
    "@xcite later on , a more systematic experimental study of the critical current in these hybrid structures was carried out with the help of diffusive sns microbridges .",
    "@xcite the results of these experiments were described by likharev ,  @xcite who made use of the usadel equations in the high temperature regime ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a more general study of the josephson effect in diffusive sns junctions was made in ref .",
    "[ ] . more recently , dubos _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite demonstrated that the full temperature dependence of the critical current of diffusive nb - cu - nb junctions with highly - transparent interfaces could be quantitatively described by the quasiclassical theory .",
    "most of the theoretical work done on proximity effect has been focused in the case of either ideal ( perfectly transmissive ) sn interfaces or in the tunneling limit ,  @xcite with some notable exceptions .",
    "@xcite one of the two main goals of this paper is to study how the local density of states ( dos ) and the supercurrent in diffusive sns junctions is influenced by arbitrary transmission of the interfaces .",
    "this is an important issue , in particular , in order to be able to establish quantitative comparisons between theory an experiment , since in reality the mismacht of material parameters leads to a broad range of transmission through the sn interfaces . in particular",
    ", we shall discuss the following issues : ( i ) how the transmission determines the magnitude of the minigap and , in general , the shape of the dos in the normal wire , both in the absence and in the presence of a supercurrent and ( ii ) how a finite transmission modifies the current - phase relation and the critical current of these junctions .",
    "our results , based on the quasiclassical theory , show that the minigap , which is reduced as the interface resistance increases , is the energy scale that controls , in particular , the magnitude and temperature dependence of the critical current . for ideal interfaces ,",
    "this role is played by the thouless energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the length of the normal metal .",
    "the second goal of our work is to study the role of spin - flip scattering in the local dos and supercurrent of diffusive sns junctions .",
    "this type of scattering , which can be induced by magnetic impurities or an external magnetic field , breaks the time reserval symmetry between the electrons in cooper pairs and reduces the superconducting correlations .",
    "@xcite different authors  @xcite have studied the effect of spin - flip scattering in the properties of sn structures . however , basic quantities like the supercurrent in sns structures have , to our knowledge , not yet been addressed .",
    "we present in this work a detailed study of the dependence of the critical current of a diffusive sns on the strength of the spin - flip scattering for arbitrary range of parameters ( length of the normal wire , temperature and interface resistance ) .",
    "our predictions can tested experimentally by measuring the critical current in the presence of magnetic field since , as long as the normal wire is a thin film , the field acts simply as a pair - breaking mechanism .",
    "@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the general formalism , based on the quasiclassical theory for diffusive superconductors , that allows us to compute the dos and the supercurrent in diffusive sns junctions for arbitrary length , temperature and interface transparency .",
    "section iii is devoted to the analysis of the local dos in the normal wire in different situations . in section",
    "iv we discuss the results for the dependence of the supercurrent on the interface resistance , temperature and strength of the spin - flip scattering . finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section v. in the appendix a we describe our analytical results for the critical current in the limit of weak proximity effect and in appendix b we include some numerical fits described in the previous sections .",

    "we assume that the transport is phase - coherent , i.e. @xmath11 and neglect the suppression of the pair potential in the s leads near the interfaces .",
    "our main goal is to study how the equilibrium properties of this system are influenced by the transparency of the sn interfaces and by the presence of a spin - flip mechanism in the diffusive wire .",
    "in particular , we want to study ( i ) the equilibrium density of states ( dos ) in the normal wire and ( ii ) the supercurrent in the sns system when a superconducting phase difference @xmath12 is established between the electrodes .    in order to describe these properties we use the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity in the diffusive limit ,  @xcite where the mean free path is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length in the normal metal , @xmath13 .",
    "this theory is formulated in terms of momentum averaged green s function @xmath14 , which depend on position @xmath15 and an energy argument @xmath0 , since we shall only deal with stationary situations .",

    "notice that , since we shall only consider equilibrium situations , the keldysh component of @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the retarded and advanced components as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the inverse of the temperature .    the propagator @xmath14 satisfies the stationary usadel equation , which in the n region reads @xcite @xmath25 +   \\epsilon \\left [ { \\bf \\check \\tau_3 } ,   { \\bf \\check g } \\right ] = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is proportional to the unit matrix in keldysh space and equal to the pauli matrix @xmath27 in electron - hole space .",

    "now , we have to provide the boundary conditions for the eqs .",
    "( [ g - eq],[gtilde - eq ] ) .",
    "let us first remind that for ideal interfaces ( perfect transparency ) such conditions at the ends of the n wire result from the continuity of the green s functions over the sn interfaces : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and the same for the coherent function with tilde .",

    "thus , the two s - n interfaces will be characterized by two quantities , namely the barrier conductance @xmath60 and the transmission @xmath58 , and our starting point for the boundary conditions will be @xmath61 } { 4\\pi^2 - \\tau \\left ( \\left\\{{\\bf \\check g}^{\\beta } , { \\bf \\check g}^{\\alpha } \\right\\ } + 2\\pi^2 \\right ) } , \\ ] ] where we have defined the ratio @xmath62 . in this language ,",
    "an ideal interface is characterized by @xmath63 and a tunnel contact is described by @xmath64 . in what follows ,",

    "( [ non - ideal ] ) by removing the term proportional to @xmath58 in the denominator .",
    "such approximation is valid strictly speaking for the case of tunnel junctions ( @xmath64 ) and it turns out to be very good for highly transparent interfaces ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "[ superc3 ] displays the zero - temperature critical current as a function of the spin - flip rate @xmath100 for different values of the wire length and ideal interfaces ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the reason for plotting the current as a function of the square root of the rate is that this plot can be seen as the magnetic field dependence of the critical current when the normal wire is a thin film .",
    "it is important to remark that in these calculations we assume that the order parameter in the leads is not affected by the spin - flip mechanism ( such an effect can be trivially included ) .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ superc3 ] the spin - flip mechanism causes a decay of the critical current .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that the spin - flip scattering acts as a pair - breaking mechanism for the cooper pairs that penetrate in the normal wire .",
    "such scattering introduces a new relevant length scale in the problem , namely the spin - flip length @xmath148 .",
    "when this length becomes smaller than the length of the system and the thermal length , it dominates the decay of the supercurrent . as we show in fig .",
    "[ superc3](b ) , when @xmath110 its normalized by its value in the absence of spin - flip rate , its decay with @xmath100 becomes universal for relatively long wires .",
    "such decay can be phenomenologically fitted with a gaussian function @xmath145 , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ superc3](b ) .",
    "the analysis detailed in appendix a suggests that , in the low transparent regime , the decay follows a law of the type @xmath149 at finite temperature , which numerically is similar to the gaussian function above .    on the other hand , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ superc3 ] , there is still a non - negligible supercurrent even when minigap is completely closed , i.e. when @xmath150 .",
    "this phenomenon in the proximity structure considered here is the equivalent of the well - known gapless superconductivity in bulk superconductors .",

    "the inset show the temperature dependence of the constant @xmath152 used in the gaussian fits : @xmath153 . ]    finally , to complete the discussion of the role of the spin - flip scattering , let us now describe what happens at finite temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ superc5 ] one can see the critical current for a wire length @xmath102 as a function of the rate @xmath100 for different values of the temperature .",
    "the main conclusion is that by increasing the temperature the decay of the critical current becomes slower .",
    "such a trend can be understood with the help of the result of appendix a.",
    "with the advances in the fabrication techniques of superconducting hybrid structures and the development of local measuring probes , it is now possible to explore the proximity effect in diffusive metallic nanostructures in great detail . in this sense , it is highly desirable from the theory side to elucidate the role of ingredients usually present in experiments such as partially transmissive interfaces and pair - breaking mechanisms . with this idea in mind , we have presented in this work a detailed analysis of the density of states and supercurrent in diffusive sns junctions . in particular , we have studied the influence in these two equilibrium properties of an arbitrary transmission of the interfaces and spin - flip scattering in the normal wire .",
    "our analysis is based on the quasiclassical theory for diffusive superconductors ( usadel theory ) , supplemented by the boundary conditions put forward by nazarov .",
    "@xcite    with respect to the local density of states , we have shown that the minigap that appears in the normal wire is very sensitive to the interface transmission both in the absence and in the presence of a supercurrent in the system .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the minigap closes when the energy rate that describes the spin - flip scattering is a few times larger than the minigap in the absence of this type of scattering .",
    "this fact nicely illustrates that the minigap is indeed the relevant energy scale for the proximity effect for non - ideal interfaces .    turning to the analysis of the supercurrent",
    ", we have shown that both the magnitude and temperature dependence of the critical current depend crucially on the interface resistance .",
    "in particular , the critical current decays faster with temperature as the interface resistance increases .",
    "moreover , we have studied how the existence of spin - flip scattering in the normal wire diminishes the supercurrent and identified the relevant energy and length scales for its decay . in particular , we have shown that a supercurrent can still flow when the minigap is completely closed , which is the analogous in proximity structures of the well - known gapless superconductivity in bulk samples .",
