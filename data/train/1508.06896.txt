    "does the glass cease to flow at some finite temperature ? \" answering this question -of pivotal importance for glass formation theories- would require ridiculously long observation times .",
    "we circumvent this infeasibility relating the ( directly inaccessible ) ultra - viscous flow of a liquid to the elastic properties of the corresponding glass , which we measure as function of its age .",
    "the older is the glass the lower is the temperature at which viscosity can be determined .",
    "taking advantage of physical vapor deposition , we rapidly obtain a wide spectrum of ages rivaling those of millenary ambers , enabling viscosity determinations at values as large as those pertaining to the asthenosphere .",
    "our result ultimately rules out the finite temperature divergence of the molecular diffusion timescale in a glass .",
    "a wide range of liquids can be cooled below the freezing point avoiding crystallization . under such circumstances , viscosity increases dramatically , up to the point where the system falls out - of - equilibrium @xcite . whether @xcite or not @xcite this increase signals a divergent behaviour is a question hitting at the core of any glass transition theory , and has attracted an increasing number of experimental investigations @xcite .",
    "the thermal history of a liquid engraves the properties of the resulting , amorphous material ( glass ) , which continuously hikes down a rugged energy landscape to enhance its stability in search of lower minima @xcite . from an opposite perspective , the way the equilibrium properties of a unique liquid are encoded in the peculiarities of different corresponding glasses , each endowed with different histories and stabilities , has always puzzled scientists and technologists @xcite .",
    "the fictive temperature @xmath0 , for instance , unambiguously signals the out - of - equilibrium arrested state accompanying the glass transition @xcite , and increases with the cooling speed , which is upper limited by the finite thermal conductivity of the sample . upon slowing down the quenching rate ,",
    "the system gets trapped in lower potential energy landscape basins ( inherent structures ) , but crystallization is also facilitated . in an attempt to rationalize such phenomenology , one way to define",
    "the glass transition temperature is as the fictive temperature at a conventional cooling rate : @xmath1 k / min@xmath2 .",
    "correspondingly , the system falls out - of - equilibrium over a timescale of @xmath3 100 s , attaining viscosities of @xmath4 poise .",
    "the impact of such an arbitrariness is mitigated by the observation that , for bulk materials , ordinary cooling rates are often confined in the range -0.1 to -10 k / min and @xmath0 varies very little .",
    "remarkably , this severely limits the free energy region accessible by the glass , at least on timescales useful for many potential applications .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite , however , that the limitations in exploring the bottom of the energy landscape can be circumvented synthesizing glasses directly well below @xmath5 , avoiding the supercooling route by physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) .",
    "these glasses are referred to as ultrastable , for their enhanced resistance against crystallization , and populate free energy regions as low as those of semi - fossilized resins @xcite aged for thousands of years .",
    "indomethacin ( imc ) , selected for this study , is a prototype organic glass - former endowed with antipyretic properties , which , in its crystalline form , has poor water - solubility and bioavailability @xcite , limitations partially removed in the amorphous phase .",
    "obtaining ultrastable amorphous imc on laboratory timescales does not improve water solubility , but enables a unique opportunity to approach the so called `` ideal glass '' , i.e. an amorphous phase with the same entropy of the undelying crystalline form .",
    "glass stability can be quantified by determining @xmath0 from the endothermic jump exhibited by the specific heat upon fast heating @xcite , due to the transformation of the glass into supercooled liquid ( materials and methods ) .",
    "we present in fig . 1 an assessment of the stabilities of imc glasses prepared by pvd at six different substrate temperatures @xmath6 in the range 190 k @xmath7 290 k , as determined using differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc )",
    ". the @xmath8 s of the depositions testifies to their stability enhancement ( compared to conventional glasses ) , which increases with the substrate temperature up to a maximum gap of 34 k with respect to @xmath5 , achieved for the most ultrastable , lowest @xmath8 case ( @xmath6=266 k , in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for such stability enhancement , attained by tuning @xmath6 , has been traced back to the increase of the surface mobility , which is believed to allow molecules to arrange themselves into lower energy configurations @xcite .",
    "specifically , for a given deposition rate , coming from the high temperature side , the ( relatively large ) surface mobility grants that the glass is `` assembled '' in equilibrium with its liquid , i.e. each layer of molecules is equilibrated before new molecules arrive in the deposition process . within this regime , the lower is the temperature , the lower the entropy of the system and the higher the stability . below a given temperature",
    "the mobility is so slow that the structure is no longer in equilibrium with the liquid , and the system becomes increasingly unstable    since the shape of the inherent structures of the energy landscape defines the vibrational properties , a question arises on the possible connection between mechanical response and glass stability , in connection with recent experimental evidences in amorphous depositions and naturally aged glasses @xcite .",
    "specifically , previous studies @xcite of imc obtained by pvd reveal a sound velocity dependence on local substrate temperature which , in turn , has been shown to relate to the onset temperature of enthalpy release measured in calorimetry upscans @xcite . to address this issue we first studied the acoustic properties of the most ultrastable deposition by a combination of time domain pump - probe optical spectroscopy and frequency domain inelastic x - ray scattering ( ixs ) .",
    "the former technique is a broadband version @xcite of picosecond photo - acoustics ( bpa ) @xcite , which we recently developed to efficiently generate and detect longitudinal acoustic wave - packets in sub-@xmath9 m thick transparent layers . specifically , by using white light pulses ( @xmath10 nm )",
    ", the energy dispersion and mode attenuation of the vibrational excitations have been simultaneously investigated in the frequency range @xmath11 ghz .",
    "ixs , on the other hand , allows the study of the high frequency limit ( thz ) , where the characteristic excitation wavelengths approach the average interparticle distance and the structural disorder becomes of crucial importance .",
    "further details on both the techniques are given in materials and methods .",
    "the dispersion curve as determined by bpa in the low frequency regime , and by ixs in the mesoscopic regime , is reported in fig .",
    "2 , along with the photoinduced differential reflectivity oscillations map and ixs spectra at fixed exchanged momenta ( insets a and b ) , from which the dispersion is obtained . in the low - frequency region , the linear energy dispersion indicates the existence of propagating vibrational excitations corresponding to a single longitudinal acoustic - like phonon branch . remarkably , the propagating nature of these excitations lingers up to the thz frequency regime .",
    "the presence of structural disorder , indeed , strongly attenuates acoustic modes at the nanometer scale .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a well defined first sharp diffraction peak mimics a first pseudo - brillouin zone and , though the vibrational eigenmodes are no longer plane waves , a well defined dominant wavevector still exists up to a zero - group velocity point corresponding to half of the pseudo - brillouin zone boundary @xcite . the obtained sound velocity ( the @xmath12 derivative of the best sinusoidal fit to ixs data , dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) is in excellent agreement with bpa data in the ten ghz range and with previous single ( lower ) frequency determination @xcite .",
    "the existence of a well defined dispersion at any lengthscales within a pseudo - brillouin zone , suggests the potential sensitivity of the acoustic properties to the local topology of the inherent structures visited by the glass .",
    "given its capability to access a sizable portion of the dispersion curve , determining sound velocity with superior accuracy ( down to 0.1 @xmath13 , about one order of magnitude better than ordinary brillouin light scattering ) bpa measurements have been extended to the other pvd samples in fig . 3 ( a and b ) . during the experiments",
    "the temperature was kept constant at t=295 k , i.e. well below @xmath5 and above the @xmath0 of the different depositions , to ensure that the glass state is arrested on the laboratory timescale .",
    "a clear inverse correlation between sound velocity and @xmath8 arises .",
    "bpa experiments also enable to determine the hypersonic attenuation @xmath14 with an accuracy of tenths of ghz , and , accordingly , determine the frequency dependence of the life - time of the vibrational excitations .",
    "as an example , the frequency dependence of @xmath14 for @xmath0 = 281 k and 301 k are reported ( pink and blue , respectively ) in fig .",
    "3 ( c ) . aiming to unravel any link with @xmath0 , we integrated the attenuation over the explored frequency range and calculated the excess relative ( and normalized ) to the most ultrastable glass ( @xmath15 k ) , as reported in fig . 3 ( d ) .",
    "the relative attenuation shows , similarly to the sound velocity , a clear but opposite ( direct ) correlation with @xmath0 .",
    "acoustic attenuation in disordered materials is ruled by different physical mechanisms @xcite . in the ghz regime , where a crystal - like picture of vibrational excitations holds",
    ", the attenuation is expected to be due to the anharmonicity of the interparticle interaction .",
    "the decrease of sound attenuation towards the lowest @xmath8 s discussed above , therefore , corroborates the idea that lower energy basins are more harmonic in nature .",
    "the distinct thermo - mechanical correlation reported in this study has important implications for the validity of those paradigms which can be uniquely benchmarked at the liquid side of the glass transition , since equilibration times dramatically increase below @xmath5 preventing direct explorations .",
    "fragility , in particular , quantifies the steepness of the liquid viscosity ( or equivalently the relaxation time , through maxwell s relation @xmath16 ) at @xmath5 , and it has a pivotal role in controlling physical properties of the supercooled phase @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the provocative idea that fast degrees of freedom characterizing glass dynamics well below @xmath5 can be predictors for slow dynamical properties of the liquid state , such as the structural relaxation time and hence fragility , is rapidly gaining consensus @xcite . while density fluctuations completely decorrelate in a liquid , as a consequence of the ergodic sampling of different basins in the energy landscape , in a glass , a residual correlation exists , uniquely determined by the entire spectrum of vibrational eigenstates of the energy minimum where the system is trapped .",
    "this is the so called non ergodicity factor ( nef ) , the long time limit of the density - density autocorrelation function . of interest here",
    ", it has been shown that the liquid fragility , m , can be determined by the low temperature behavior of the nef , @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the nef can be quantified in different ways . among them , by the relative sound velocity jump occurring at the glass transition @xcite , namely : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the liquid and glass sound velocity values , respectively , and @xmath21 expresses the above discussed correlation with fragility m @xcite , verified in ordinary imc glass @xcite .",
    "critically , @xmath19 is an equilibrium property of the liquid , while @xmath20 is shown here to depend upon the very stability of the corresponding glass .",
    "this advocates the extension of the fragility concept to a temperature dependent steepness index @xcite , @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , which we use here to obtain the equilibrium viscosity below @xmath5 .",
    "the mechanical response of a glass of a given stability , indeed , determines the viscosity of its liquid at the corresponding @xmath0 , via the dependence @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ alfa ] , reported in fig .",
    "integrating this latter ( see eq . [ notes ] in materials and methods ) , an arrhenius plot can ultimately be obtained , shown in fig .",
    "the super - arrhenius behaviour documented in imc above @xmath5 @xcite is reported as dashed line representing a vogel - fulcher - tamman ( vft ) function . for @xmath25",
    "a remarkable deviation is observed : the apparent fragility is larger than m , but falls below the vft expectation , and decreases with the glass stability , signifying a fragile - to - strong transition , quantified in fig .",
    "this result verifies the predictions of kovacs and adam - gibbs - vogel models from aged imc @xcite and rationalizes very recent work in naturally long - time aged amber @xcite , which set an upper bound to the temperature dependence of the dynamics below @xmath26 .",
    "it is also in line with the conclusion against the vft extrapolations in the glass @xcite , and relates to the observation of an additional non arrhenius equilibration process in polymers @xcite .",
    "moreover , the simultaneous decrease of both the acoustic attenuation and generalized fragility reported here at low @xmath8 s , validates recent molecular dynamic simulations @xcite which put forward a direct correlation between kinetic fragility m and the degree of anharmonicity of the interparticle interaction potential .",
    "all together , these evidences syncretize on the scenario schematically depicted in fig .",
    "4 , establishing a firm link between the hypsometric characterization of the energy landscape and basin - specific vibrational properties . crucial to technological applications ,",
    "the mechanical approach advanced here to assess stability is a non destructive one , as opposed to calometric determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "most important , we demonstrate that the state of the glass is totally identified by @xmath0 and @xmath27 , and once the non ergodicity parameter is calculated by the sound velocity jump at @xmath0 it is possible to determine the relaxation time from equation eqs .",

    "the emerging protcol provides a unique way to capture essential features of a liquid attaining the structural arrest away from @xmath26 , up to relaxation times beyond @xmath28 s , corresponding to exapoise viscosities . in conclusion",
    ", we circumvented here the major hindrances to probe equilibrium properties below the ordinary glass transition temperature : crystallization tendency and unrealistic observation times .",
    "the isothermal measurement of mechanical properties for glassy phases with different @xmath0 reveals the increase of the longitudinal elastic modulus and decrease of the acoustic loss below @xmath5 , which we connect to a breakdown of the vft law .",
    "this may lead to reconsider old paradigms based on dynamical divergency to ever reach a definitive understanding of the glass transition .",
