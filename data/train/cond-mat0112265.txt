    "effect of impurities on transport in superconducting nanostructures is one of the key issues in the physics of mesoscopic superconductors , among which point contacts are the simplest devices of interest .",
    "one can distinguish contacts with only a few transverse eigenmodes ( or conducting channels ) relevant for a given temperature ( quantum contacts ) and those where the number of channels @xmath0 is relatively large ( mesoscopic contacts ) .",
    "in quantum contacts , the effect of impurities on both static and transport properties can be satisfactorily described by introducing certain transmission and reflection probability @xmath1 for each conducting channel @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic weak links with disorder are sometimes also treated within this scheme . to this end , a quantum eigenstate problem for a charge carrier is to be solved for the particular realization of disorder , each state being considered as an individual channel with certain transmission probability . the problem of a multichannel weak link is then mapped into that for a set of tunnel contacts having an effective distribution of transmission probabilities . this scheme has been shown recently @xcite to be equivalent to the semi - classical theory of superconductivity for calculating some _ static _ properties of multichannel contacts .",
    "the individual channels found by solving the quantum - mechanical problem are independent in the sense that transitions between them are absent under static conditions .",
    "one might now raise a question how useful is the model of independent channels for _ transport _ properties of multichannel contacts when time - dependent perturbations induce transitions between the individual channels .",
    "this is of a crucial importance for further theoretical studies of transport in superconducting mesoscopic multichannel devices in presence of disorder .",
    "we address this problem using a specific example of a ballistic point contact between two clean superconductors assuming that the thickness @xmath2 of the insulating layer and the size @xmath3 of the orifice in it are much larger than atomic dimensions but shorter than the coherence length @xmath4 and the mean free path @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the contact thus has a very large number of conducting channels , @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of the midgap states localized within the coherence length @xmath4 near the point contact was first found in @xcite @xmath8 for a phase difference @xmath9 between the two superconductors .",
    "the spectrum is degenerate : all particles flying from one superconductor into another have the same energy independently of their momentum directions within the corresponding hemispheres .",
    "another example is a contact having a tunnel barrier with a transmission probability @xmath10 .",
    "the spectrum @xcite @xmath11 has a ( mini)gap @xmath12 near the phase difference @xmath13 , which separates the two branches of the spectrum .",
    "the mid - gap states have a profound effect on dynamics of the contacts . when the applied voltage is larger than the inelastic relaxation rate , @xmath14 , a nonlinear regime sets in which originates from multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) @xcite of localized quasiparticles .",
    "for a contact without both impurities and a barrier , excitations from below the gap edge with @xmath15 are accelerated through the midgap states eq.([spectr / clean ] ) and re - appear above the gap with @xmath16 and vice versa , thus producing a highly nonequilibrium situation . on the contrary , if a contact has a barrier with a reflectivity @xmath17 , the localized excitations can not accelerate due to the minigap and retain their original states .",
    "it is only zener tunnelling through the minigap that provides nonequilibrium current through the contact @xcite .    the model of independent channels",
    "was applied to kinetic effects in multichannel point contacts in ref .",
    "the key ingredients of that model were ( i ) the mar processes in separate channels with ( ii ) zener transitions through a minigap between two spectral branches in eq .",
    "( [ specrt / tunnel ] ) within each individual channel , and ( iii ) a standard distribution @xcite of reflection coefficients over the channels .",
    "here we study the transport in mesoscopic multichannel contacts with impurities and show that the above model of individual channels consisting of processes ( i)(iii ) is not suitable for dynamic phenomena when the number of channels is large , @xmath18 , because transitions between different channels are excited in time - dependent conditions .",
    "as a result , the system finds the optimal way to relax through channels with small reflection probabilities avoiding weak zener tunneling .",
    "we further demonstrate that the concept of mar is equivalent to the _ spectral flow _ appearing in a wide variety of quantum systems @xcite . using the quasiclassical theory of nonstationary superconductivity",
    "we show that the impurity scattering provides an effective momentum exchange between particles moving from the opposite sides of the contact and impedes the mar acceleration",
    ". for low inelastic relaxation rate , the i  v curve displays a non - trivial behavior : at low voltages , impurity relaxation slows the acceleration down and results in a new linear current - voltage dependence with a large conductance .",
    "this differs from a square - root dependence obtained within the independent - channel model ( i)(iii ) .",

    "the reason is that , in a macroscopic contact , the quantum channels are very close to each other in energies with the level spacings inversely proportional to the number of channels @xmath0 . thus , in addition to the transitions within each channel ( which are the only ones considered in the independent - channel model ) , time dependent processes excite even more effectively transitions _ between different channels_. as a result , the distribution function is spread over the entire energy interval of nonzero dos or over the range @xmath185 of reflection coefficients .",

    "thus the fraction of essential channels contributing to the current in multichannel contacts is decreased by a factor @xmath191 as compared to the independent channel model .",
    "this yields a much smaller current compared to what is predicted by the kinetic - equation approach .",
    "therefore , the zener processes can be neglected in favor of the momentum relaxation on impurities .",
    "to summarize , the model based on zener transitions within independent channels does not seem to be suitable for kinetic processes in multichannel contacts .",
