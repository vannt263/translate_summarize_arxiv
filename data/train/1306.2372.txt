    "more than 30 years the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite is playing the leading role in studies of the nuclear multifragmentation reactions @xcite which , probably , is one of the most spectacular phenomena that is available for exploration in nuclear reactions at intermediate energies .",
    "additionally , the smm greatly stimulated the studies of phase transition ( pt ) in finite systems @xcite and investigation of nonhomogeneous phases of strongly interacting matter in astrophysics @xcite and heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a simplified version of the smm without the coulomb and asymmetry terms was proposed in @xcite .",
    "its analytical solution was obtained in @xcite , where an additional parameter , the fisher exponent @xmath0 , was introduced in the model . the value of fisher exponent extracted from nuclear experiments @xcite turned out to be @xmath2 , i.e. well below the prediction of the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) @xmath3 @xcite , but in a good correspondence with the critical exponent analysis made in @xcite for the simplified smm .",
    "this fact initiated new attempts to analyze the multifragmentation data in order to extract the values of the exponent @xmath0 and critical temperature @xcite .",
    "these studies gave a first evidence that the nuclear liquid - gas pt has the tricritical endpoint rather than the critical one @xcite .",
    "the successes achieved by the smm in describing many sets of different experimental data gave enough proofs of its validity and this very fact prevented researches from asking two simple conceptual questions : why does the smm perfectly work in describing the low density nuclear vapour that appears after the multifragmentation , and why the smm is unable to describe the high densities of nuclear matter achieved , for example , in heavy ion collisions . at first glance",
    "the answer on the second question seems to be very trivial : the smm considers nucleons and all nuclear fragments as incompressible objects .",
    "this can be seen from the excluded volume of the @xmath4-nucleon fragment which is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 @xmath7 denotes the normal nuclear density .",
    "thus , the limiting particle density appears in the smm due to the van der waals like treatment of the short range repulsion between the fragments .",
    "however , in this case we really face a difficult problem to get the answer on the first of the above questions and to explain the reason why the smm is so good in describing the experimental data at freeze - out density which is between @xmath8 and @xmath9 of @xmath10 . it is well known that to describe the thermodynamics at low densities one has to use the virial expansion and account , at least , for the second virial coefficients @xmath11 between all pairs of fragments of the hard core radii @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the real problem , however , is that the smm employs not the second virial coefficients which provide the description of low density matter , but uses the proper volumes of the @xmath4-nucleon fragments @xmath14 , which , usually , enter in the high density limit @xcite !",
    "therefore , in order to understand why the smm is successful at low densities , first of all , we have to return to its basic assumptions and find out , how the virial coefficients appear in this model .",
    "the simplified version of the smm @xcite which is solved analytically in @xcite is much more elaborate than the fdm @xcite since , in contrast to the latter one , the smm explicitly contains the nonzero proper sizes of all fragments and , hence , the liquid phase .",
    "however , in the standard smm the nuclear liquid is incompressible , that is too rough approximation at higher temperatures . moreover , the critical and tricritical endpoints of the simplified smm @xcite appear at the density of a liquid phase @xmath15 , while in ordinary substances the critical density is about one third of that one for low temperature liquid phase @xcite . in present paper",
    "we extend the smm to account for the compressibility of nuclear liquid and show how the equation for the surface tension coefficient induced by interaction between the nuclear fragments naturally appears from the virial expansion .",
    "such an analysis allows us to answer the two conceptual questions formulated above .",
    "the developed approach has common features with refs .",
    "@xcite , but compared to these works we obtain an equation for the surface tension coefficient which is induced by interaction between the nuclear fragments . therefore , the developed model can be considered as a further refinement of the ideas formulated in @xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a heuristic derivation of the equations for the gaseous phase pressure and for the surface tension induced by the hard core repulsion .",
    "the conditions of the 1-st and 2-nd order pt of a liquid - gas type are formulated in section 3 .",
    "the properties of the liquid phase pressure and the phase diagrams for various parameterizations of the present model are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to an analysis of the fragment size distributions when going from subcritical to supercritical temperatures .",
    "the conclusions are formulated in section 6 .",
    "in order to recapitulate the formal steps of obtaining the van der waals eos in the grand canonical ensemble , let us consider the one - component gas with the hard core repulsion .",

    "also it is important to note that in ( [ eqviii ] ) the induced surface free energy coefficient is extrapolated to high densities using the same ensemble of one - particle distribution functions @xmath49 for @xmath4-nucleon fragments as the one employed in ( [ eqvii ] ) .",

    "it is easy to find that the reason for such a behavior is just a cancellation of the bulk and surface contributions in the vicinity of @xmath300 .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the saddle - like mass distributions were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors numerically studied the multifragmentation scenario for the ensemble of classical particles interacting via the lennard - jones potential .",
    "thus , the full curve in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite is very similar to the distributions with the negative surface tension coefficient discussed above , although its extrema are not so well pronounced as the ones shown in figs . [ figd_3 ] and [ figd_4 ] .",
    "it is , of corse , difficult to directly compare our results for the fragment size distributions with the ones found in @xcite and to make some definite conclusions , since the authors of @xcite either studied small systems ( 189 particles ) in which the finite size effects are strong ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) or they have low statistics for the power law shown in fig . 8 of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the authors of @xcite claimed to find a curve of power law size attenuations with nearly constant energy per particle .",
    "note that such a behavior is typical for the present model along the curve of the 2-nd order pt .",
    "in @xcite it was also found that in the course of expansion from the initially dense state to a dilute state the fragments are highly nonspherical and they have fractal surfaces .",
    "the above analysis of the gaseous fragment size distributions shows us that the fractals which appear at the tricritical point or at the states of the 2-nd order pt correspond to a power law dependence on the size of fragments , whereas the fractals associated with the negative values of the surface tension coefficient manifest themselves in the nonmonotonic fragment size distributions of the saddle - like shape .",
    "therefore , it is quite possible that the negative surface tension is responsible for the peculiar and nonmonotonic fragment size distributions reported in @xcite , but for a more definite conclusion a detailed comparison between the two models is needed .",
    "in the present work we propose a new smm formulation based on the consistent treatment of the second virial coefficients for the ensemble of nuclear fragments .",
    "such a virial expansion allows us to explicitly account for the many - body effects .",
    "our analysis shows that interaction between the nuclear fragments induces an additional contribution into the surface tension free energy .",
    "it is shown that by a proper choice of the temperature dependence of the full surface tension the standard smm which accounts only for the proper volumes of fragments is able to correctly reproduce the low density virial expansion up to the second order .",
    "this resolves an old puzzle of why the smm is so good at low densities , although it employes the hard core repulsion approximation which is suited for high densities only .",
    "the present model , however , leads to an additional equation for the induced surface tension coefficient , which at the moment accounts only for the repulsion between the nuclear fragments . in order to simplify the presentation of our idea and to make easier an analysis of the model phase diagram",
    ", here we assumed that the effects of attraction between the nuclear fragments are implicitly accounted in the temperature dependent surface tension coefficient of the fragments .",
    "however , the treatment of the model with an attraction between the fragments will be our next step .",
    "another important result of the present work is extension of the previous model for the case of a compressible nuclear liquid .",
    "this is achieved by introducing an additional @xmath17-dependent term in the expression for liquid phase pressure .",
    "note that the obtained model eos for @xmath232 obeys the basic axioms of the statistical mechanics formulated by l. van hove .",
    "it does not lead to an appearance of the non - monotonic isotherms in the mixed phase region which are typical for the mean - field models .",
    "a direct consequence of the finite liquid compressibility is that the present model allows us to generate the tricritical endpoint at @xmath176 , which is a typical value of critical density for the liquid - gas pts in the ordinary liquids .",
    "this novel feature makes the present model more realistic than the standard smm .",
    "the range of the fisher parameter in this model is @xmath301 , whereas in the simplified smm all values of the parameter @xmath0 are allowed .",
    "the other important difference with the simplified smm is that in the present model there exist the tricritical points only and this is possible for @xmath302 .",
    "thus , our analysis showed that in the present model each 1-st order pt curve is ended at the curve of the 2-nd ( or higher ) order pt .",
    "it is found that the 2-nd order pt in the tricritical point exists for @xmath1 , while the @xmath34-th ( @xmath303 ) order pt in a tricritical point exist for @xmath136 .    for @xmath111 we found that , in contrast to the simplified smm , the 1-st order pt exists at @xmath235 and , hence , in this case instead of the critical endpoint the model exhibit a critical line .",
    "therefore , the physical range of the fisher parameter @xmath0 should be constrained by @xmath1 .",
    "our analysis of the fragment size distributions in the region of negative surface tension coefficient showed that these distributions have an unusual saddle - like shape .",
    "we established a simple relation between the local minimum position in the fragment size @xmath275 and the dimensionless surface term @xmath286 which can be used to estimate the @xmath80 value directly from the fragment size distribution .",
    "we would like to stress that the distributions of a similar shape were observed in molecular dynamical studies of multifragmentation for the particles interacting via the lennard - jones potential @xcite .",
    "highly nonspherical shapes of the fragments observed in these simulations , allow us to believe that all these features of the dynamical multifragmentation can be related to the negative surface tension coefficient in supercritical region .    in the developed model",
    "the contribution of surface tension induced by the repulsive interaction between the nuclear fragments is evaluated in a simplified form . nevertheless , in combination with a finite incompressibility of liquid phase it gave us rather rich phase structure of the nuclear matter phase diagram .",
    "it is clear that a realistic short - range attraction between the nuclear fragments should also be included in order to correctly locate the region of the 2-nd order phase transition .",
