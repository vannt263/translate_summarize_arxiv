    "modeling non - deterministic physical systems is a modern subject of research that covers many different disciplines . for models that use an",
    "_ a priori _ source of randomness , the gaussian white noise is the most common ingredient .",
    "nevertheless there is a growing interest in searching alternatives to the white noise .",
    "there are two main characteristics , often considered unrealistic for modeling , that motivate these researches : the white noise induces ( i ) infinitely many randomness for each small interval of time and ( ii ) unlimited fast fluctuations , although with an exponentially decreasing probability .",
    "the random telegraph signal ( named also binary or dichotomous process ) is the most elementary assumption that does not suffer of these pathologies : it is a signal switching randomly between two values , with a determined law for switching times . as examples of application to science and engineering , we mention : anomalous diffusion @xcite , reaction - diffusion @xcite , scattering of radiation @xcite , biological dispersal @xcite , for diffusive processes , and non - maxwellian equilibrium @xcite , diagnostic technique for semiconductor lasers @xcite , filtered telegraph signal @xcite , harmonic oscillators @xcite , for systems having an equilibrium .    for an introduction ,",
    "let us consider a dissipative process subject to a noised input : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a dynamical variable and @xmath2 represents the noise .",
    "when @xmath2 is the gaussian white noise , @xmath1 is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and the associated equation @xmath3 , describing the density distribution function @xmath4 , results by the well known fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 is taken as the random telegraph signal , the same equation describes a filtered random telegraph process @xcite or , equivalently , a langevin equation @xcite subject to a dichotomous noise .",
    "@xmath2 alternately takes on values @xmath5 , with an exponential ( or poisson ) switch probability density function of the form : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the average time @xmath8 between switches . with this assumption , we see that the eq .",
    "( [ frtp ] ) can be integrated as an ordinary differential equation , provided that not any switching event happen inside the integration interval .",
    "therefore , with the exceptions of switching times , the process is deterministic , composed of pieces of increasing and decreasing exponentials .",
    "anyway , the whole resulting process @xmath1 is not deterministic , it represents a random sample path in a probability space , and the statistical properties can be described using the characteristic functional method @xcite or the associated probability densities distribution @xmath9 , governed by a liouville - master equation of the following form @xcite : @xmath10    this kind of process is a case of a more general class of _ piecewise - deterministic processes _ that were formalized by davis @xcite . following this framework , in sect .",

    "[ numtest ] the numerical solution of a dissipative model is plotted and compared to monte carlo s histograms of the same process .",
    "the process described by eq . ( [ frtp ] ) , rather than a single equation driven by a binary noise , can be regarded as composed of pieces of two deterministic equations having two velocity states .",
    "it is clear that following this point of view , we can perform some extensions : ( i ) on the number of states of the system , ( ii ) on the laws governing the velocity of the dynamical variable @xmath1 , ( iii ) on the statistics of the generating randomness .",
    "based on these ideas we can formalize a piecewise deterministic process as follows :    1 .",
    "the dynamics is described by the equation : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a function chosen randomly in a set of @xmath13 functions . given @xmath14 , we say that the dynamics is in the state @xmath15 .",
    "we require that @xmath16 be lipschitz continuous , so that for fixed @xmath15 , @xmath1 exists and is unique",
    "the initial condition is settled either by the cauchy problem to eq .",
    "( [ rte_estesa_1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath17 , and by the initial state of the process .",
    "states are characterised by a poisson statistics of _ switching times _ : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "4 .   at every _ switching time",
    "_ the dynamics can change from the state @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) to the state @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) according to a transition probability matrix ( or stochastic matrix ) : @xmath24 having the following fundamental @xcite properties : @xmath25 and @xmath26 , for each @xmath27 .    we can easily visualize this process as a sequence of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ rte_estesa_1 ] ) , where the end point of each is just the initial condition for the successive integral curve , so that this process is continuous , because at switching times only the first derivative of @xmath1 is involved .",

    "we focus our attention on solutions @xmath51 having an equilibrium , but the numerical scheme can be extended to diffusion processes too .",
    "conditions for the existence of equilibrium solution can be conjectured by using simple dynamical considerations @xcite .",
