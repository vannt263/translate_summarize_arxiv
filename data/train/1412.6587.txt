    "the analogous problem for the @xmath12 limit of the navier - stokes equations is an important open problem .",
    "as we have seen , the second - grade fluids equation provides a natural family of problems which formally interpolates between these situations , aside from having independent interest , see @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to examine the limit @xmath27 of the second - grade fluids equations , in the hope of shedding light into the contrast between the vanishing @xmath4 limit of euler-@xmath4 and the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes system in the presence of a boundary layer .",
    "our investigation of the limit @xmath27 of solutions to is expressed in three different results .",
    "first , we prove that if @xmath7 , under appropriate conditions on regularity and convergence of initial data , solutions of the second - grade fluid equations converge to solutions of the euler system in @xmath28 in space , uniformly in time , as @xmath29 .",
    "this result is a natural extension of the main result in @xcite , and the condition @xmath7 can be interpreted as a smallness condition on @xmath22 , implying that the second - grade fluid equations behave as a small perturbation of the euler-@xmath4 system .",
    "the other results are kato - type criteria ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for convergence .",
    "first , we prove that , if @xmath30 , convergence is equivalent to vanishing of the energy dissipation rate in a region near the boundary of width @xmath31 .",
    "note that , with the condition imposed on @xmath22 , this width is known to vanish as @xmath8 , but no rate can be asserted . in this result , the second - grade fluid equations are still a small perturbation of the euler-@xmath4 model , but the perturbation is larger , so that convergence is lost and only the sharp characterization of convergence is retained . for the last result ,",
    "we assume @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", we prove that convergence is equivalent to vanishing of the energy dissipation rate in a region of width @xmath32 near the boundary , which is precisely the result obtained by kato for the navier - stokes system in @xcite . in contrast with the first two results , this last result imposes a smallness condition on @xmath4 , which can be interpreted as thinking of the second - grade fluids system as a small perturbation of the navier - stokes system .",
    "the result proved is , therefore , a natural extension of the original result by kato @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the regions of validity of the three results in figure 1 below ,    ; between ii and iii : @xmath33 ; between iii and iv : @xmath34.,width=240,height=240 ]    convergence in region iv , sharp convergence criteria in regions i and iii , and no result obtained in region ii .",
    "the proofs of all three results are technically very similar , based on the use of energy estimates and boundary correctors , following the ideas introduced by kato in @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature associated with the vanishing viscosity and vanishing @xmath4 limits , which we briefly survey below . for the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes equations",
    ", convergence is known in cases without boundary , see for example , @xcite and references therein , and for navier boundary conditions , see @xcite . for no - slip",
    "boundary conditions the problem is open , with sharp convergence criteria obtained first by kato in @xcite , and reformulations of kato s criteria obtained in @xcite . for a recent survey on this subject , see @xcite .",
    "the literature associated with the @xmath8 problem is much smaller .",
    "in addition to the convergence result in @xcite , already mentioned , it was shown in @xcite that , in the whole space , solutions of euler-@xmath4 converge to the corresponding solutions of the euler equations , as @xmath29 . in @xcite , the limit @xmath3 of the solutions of with navier - type boundary conditions was shown to converge to the corresponding solutions of the euler equations , irrespective of the relative vanishing rates of @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",

    "<S> the second - grade fluid equations are a model for viscoelastic fluids , with two parameters : @xmath0 , corresponding to the elastic response , and @xmath1 , corresponding to viscosity . formally setting these parameters to @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> reduces the equations to the incompressible euler equations of ideal fluid flow . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we study the limits @xmath3 of solutions of the second - grade fluid system , in a smooth , bounded , two - dimensional domain with no - slip boundary conditions . this class of problems interpolates between the euler-@xmath4 model ( @xmath5 ) , for which the authors recently proved convergence to the solution of the incompressible euler equations , and the navier - stokes case ( @xmath6 ) , for which the vanishing viscosity limit is an important open problem . </S>",
    "<S> we prove three results . </S>",
    "<S> first , we establish convergence of the solutions of the second - grade model to those of the euler equations provided @xmath7 , as @xmath8 , extending the main result in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we prove equivalence between convergence ( of the second - grade fluid equations to the euler equations ) and vanishing of the energy dissipation in a suitably thin region near the boundary , in the asymptotic regime @xmath9 , @xmath10 as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to a convergence criterion similar to the well - known kato criterion for the vanishing viscosity limit of the navier - stokes equations to the euler equations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtain an extension of kato s classical criterion to the second - grade fluid model , valid if @xmath11 , as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of all these results relies on energy estimates and boundary correctors , following the original idea by kato .    </S>",
