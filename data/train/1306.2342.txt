    "the neutrino oscillation data unambiguously establish that neutrinos have tiny but non - zero masses , the explanation of which calls for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a simple paradigm for understanding the smallness of left - handed ( lh ) neutrino masses is the ( type - i ) seesaw mechanism  @xcite where one introduces a set of heavy sm singlet majorana fermions @xmath0 breaking the @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "the seesaw matrix has the generic form in the @xmath2 space : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dirac mass term which mixes the @xmath5 and @xmath0 states , and @xmath6 is the majorana mass term for @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the seesaw formula for light neutrinos of the form  @xcite @xmath7 and a heavy - light neutrino mixing of order @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "thus there are two key aspects to the seesaw mechanism : the majorana mass of the heavy neutrino , and the mixing between the heavy and light neutrinos . to probe the seesaw paradigm experimentally , one must therefore test both the majorana nature of @xmath0 and the heavy - light neutrino mixing effects .",
    "there are two possible ways to do this .",
    "the first well known way is to test for the majorana nature of both the heavy and light neutrino masses via searches for the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath9 ) and disentangle the heavy neutrino effect  @xcite which however does not necessarily probe the heavy - light neutrino mixing .",
    "the second way is to directly look for the presence of heavy - light mixing , which can manifest in several ways , e.g. , ( i ) via departures from unitarity of the pmns neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite , which can be probed in neutrino oscillation experiments as well as lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) searches , and ( ii ) via their signatures in colliders  @xcite . clearly for these latter tests of seesaw to be effective",
    ", the mixing parameter @xmath10 must be significant and this requires that @xmath6 must be small ( in the tev range ) and @xmath4 large ( in the few gev range ) simultaneously .",
    "it is the second aspect of testing seesaw at colliders that we focus on in this paper .    to proceed with details ,",
    "we remind the reader that the simplest implementation of the seesaw paradigm is to add the gauge - singlet neutrino field @xmath0 with a majorana mass @xmath6 to the sm .",
    "the seesaw scale ( synonymous with @xmath6 ) then remains an adhoc parameter unconnected to any new physics or symmetry .",
    "we will call this scenario the sm - seesaw in what follows . on the other hand , these heavy neutrinos @xmath0 naturally arise as the right - handed ( rh ) partners of the lh neutrinos in the left - right ( l - r ) symmetric extension of the sm which was originally introduced  @xcite in order to understand the origin of parity violation in weak interactions at low energies . the minimal l - r symmetric theory , based on the @xmath11 gauge group ,",
    "provides a natural explanation of the seesaw scale as connected to the @xmath12 breaking scale .",
    "the smallness of the lh neutrino mass in these theories is connected to the extent to which the rh - current effects in weak interactions are suppressed at low energy .",
    "we will call this scenario the l - r seesaw .",
    "thus , a tev - scale l - r symmetric theory provides an attractive class of seesaw models that can be probed at the lhc  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "here we propose a possible distinction between the various contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by considering two kinematic variables , namely , the dilepton invariant mass distribution and angular correlation between the charged leptons . for a realistic collider simulation , the parton - level signal events generated by calchep  @xcite are fed into pythia  @xcite and pgs4  @xcite to implement parton showering , hadronization and detector effects .",
    "we have used an anti-@xmath13 jet algorithm with jet cone size parameter @xmath14 .",
    "apart from the basic selection criteria of two same - sign muons and two light jets , we have implemented the following selection cuts for both @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes following the latest atlas analysis  @xcite : @xmath17 gev , @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 gev , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 $ ] gev . for the @xmath24 mode",
    ", we have implemented the cuts following the latest cms analysis  @xcite : @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 gev , @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 gev , @xmath30 and @xmath21 . for comparison ,",
    "all distributions have been normalized to unity after applying the cuts .",
    "the simulation results for an illustrative case with @xmath31 , @xmath32 tev and @xmath33 tev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    , @xmath16 and @xmath24 modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for comparison ,",
    "all distributions have been normalized to unity.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] , @xmath16 and @xmath24 modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for comparison ,",
    "all distributions have been normalized to unity.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    it is clear that the dilepton invariant mass distribution ( left panel ) is a good kinematic variable for distinction between the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath24 modes at the lhc .",
    "the angular correlation between the two leptons ( right panel ) is another good variable to distinguish the @xmath16 and @xmath24 case from the @xmath15 case due to different helicity correlations .",
    "in summary , we have pointed out a new contribution to the smoking gun collider signals of a tev scale left - right seesaw model i.e. @xmath34 coming from the heavy - light neutrino mixing contribution ( called @xmath16 in the text ) which can dominate over the usually discussed @xmath15 and @xmath24 contributions .",
    "probing this contribution can provide crucial information on the detailed nature of the seesaw mechanism and supplement searches for this effect using violations of unitarity of the pmns matrix .",
    "this will provide extremely important information regarding the detailed nature of left - right tev scale seesaw models .",
    "we emphasize the importance of this channel for heavy majorana neutrino searches in the hope that this will be taken into account in the future experimental analyses , along with the usual @xmath15 and @xmath24 channels .",
    "we show how taking into account this @xmath16 contribution can improve the collider limits on the left - right neutrino mixing in certain parameter domains of the seesaw matrix , with the improvement becoming more prominent as we go to higher heavy neutrino masses and higher center of mass energy at the lhc .",
    "we also propose a simple way to distinguish the different contributions and to identify the dominant channel by analyzing the invariant mass distribution and angular correlation of the two same - sign leptons .",
    "should a same - sign dilepton plus two jets with no missing energy signal be observed at the lhc , this will help us in determining the existence of a tev - scale lr - symmetry as well as the structure of the seesaw matrix .",
