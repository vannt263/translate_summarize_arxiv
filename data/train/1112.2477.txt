    "the discovery of the charm - quark in 1974 by detecting the @xmath0-particle @xcite has completed the second quark - generation and was a manifest triumph of the quark - model . while @xmath0 is a bound state of a charm - quark and an anti - charm quark , @xmath1 , so - called open - charmed mesons were discovered soon afterwards : @xmath2 , and their corresponding anti - mesons @xmath3 .",
    "the open charmed mesons are much easier accessible experimentally , because the d - mesons are the lightest particles which contain a charm - quark and their lifetime is a few orders of magnitude larger than @xmath0 : the mass of @xmath0 is @xmath4 and the lifetime is @xmath5 , while , for instance , the mass of @xmath6-meson is @xmath7 and the lifetime @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "whereas charmed mesons in vacuum were studied thoroughly ever since , nothing is known so far from experimental side about the properties of these mesons in medium .",
    "nowadays , experiments are initiated to study charmed mesons embedded in a hadronic medium .",
    "in fact , the upcoming accelerator fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research ) at gsi ( gesellschaft fr schwer - ionenforschung ) in darmstadt / germany @xcite offers the opportunity to study charmed mesons in dense nuclear matter .",
    "especially , the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter ) collaboration intends to study the near - threshold production of d - mesons and @xmath0 in heavy - ion collisions , while the panda ( anti - proton anihilation at darmstadt ) collaboration will focus on charm spectroscopy as well as on charmed mesons produced by anti - proton annihilation in nuclei .",
    "this growing interest can also be motivated from in - medium modifications of k - mesons , that is an expected down - shift of @xmath9 and an up - shift of @xmath10 with increasing density @xcite .",
    "there is a similarity between d - mesons and k - mesons in respect to their quark structure : @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12 , while @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we conclude the qualitative fact , that both strangeness and charm might be regarded as probes of the in - medium situation . moreover",
    ", the expected in - medium modifications of d - mesons might have a considerable impact on normal @xmath0 suppression , e.g. @xcite , and open - charm enhancement , e.g. @xcite , in heavy - ion collisions .    despite the upcomming experiments cbm and panda , theoretical investigations of charmed mesons , both in vacuum and in medium , are fairly rare .",
    "one reason is , that the well - established perturbation theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of strong interactions , can not be applied , because the momentum transfer @xmath15 among bound quarks is small @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "thus , the running coupling constant of qcd @xmath17 becomes large , and non - perturbative approaches are compelling in order to derive the physical properties of mesons from fundamental principles .    especially , the infrared regime of qcd is complicated due to the still unresolved phenomenon of confinement .",
    "one aspect of thereof is the non - vanishing of normal - ordered products of quark and gluon field operators taken between the non - perturbative , so - called physical , groundstate @xmath18 of qcd , e.g. the chiral quark and gluon  condensate : @xmath19    here , @xmath20 denotes normal - ordering of a composite operator @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the quark field operator of color index @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the gluon field strengh tensor , where @xmath25 are lorentz - indices and @xmath26 is the gell - mann index ; troughout the article the einstein convention is used .",
    "vacuum expectation values like ( [ intro_1 ] ) and ( [ intro_2 ] ) are called vacuum - condensates , a term which refers to the fact that the physical ground state of qcd is not `` empty '' but contains colorless and chargeless states of strongly bounded ( condensed ) quarks and gluons .",
    "in contrast , in the perturbative vacuum @xmath27 of qcd the normal - ordered condensates vanish , e.g. : @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    at finite baryonic densities",
    "the vacuum - condensates are generalized to in - medium - condensates , where the in - medium state is denoted by @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31    the ground state of a hadronic medium can be approximated as a fermi - gas of nucleons : @xmath32 .",
    "it is a formidable challenge to evaluate vacuum and in - medium condensates from first principles of qcd .",
    "so far , approximative solutions have been obtained ( e.g. lattice gauge theory , wilson loop expansion , instantons , etc . ) , but a comprehensive understanding of the confinement problem is far out of reach .",
    "therefore , the question arises how fundamental qcd parameters may be related to the vacuum and in - medium properties of mesons .",
    "one of the best methods among the non - perturbative approaches are the qcd sum rules ( qsr ) , which link hadronic observables like mass , decay - width and coupling - constant of the hadron under consideration to fundamental parameters of qcd .",
    "the qsr have first been developed for mesons in vacuum @xcite , and later been generalized to the case of mesons in medium @xcite , see also @xcite for the case of finite density and temperature .",
    "the decisive advantage of this approach is , that qsr consider the existence of vacuum  condensates and in - medium  condensates as a given fact , instead of determining their numerical values by first principles of qcd . in this way",
    ", qsr are not concerend with the problem of confinement , but assume that confinement exists and they are neither concerned with the involved structure of the groundstate @xmath33 nor the in - medium state @xmath30 .    thus ,",
    "once a very few parameters , i.e. numerical values of condensates , are given , physical properties of a large variety of hadrons can be predicted .",
    "the link between hadronic observables and fundamental parameters of qcd is given by a dispersion relation of n - point correlators which are non - local products of n operators : @xmath34 .",
    "here , we consider so - called current - current correlators @xmath35 , which are two - point correlators .",
    "the analyticity of the current - current operator allows to relate the time - like region ( hadronic part ) with the space - like region ( qcd part ) of that operator .",
    "while the hadronic side of the dispersion relation is parametrized by means of hadronic observables , the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite is applied on the qcd side . in general",
    ", the product @xmath36 diverges in the limit @xmath37 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the wilson ope allows to decompose the product of non - local operators in terms of a series of regular local operators @xmath21 and so - called wilson coefficients @xmath38 which are divergent for @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath39    the point of the ope ( [ intro_5 ] ) is that the fields of the currents are separated into a hard and a soft part .",
    "the hard part is proportional to the unit operator and can be treated perturbatively , i.e. can be evaluated with respect to the perturbative vacuum @xmath27 .",
    "the spatial dependence of the soft part can be taylor expanded and leads to local condensates in the medium state @xmath40 .    in general , the currents of the correlator are interpolating fields , which carry the symmetries of the specific hadron : spin , isospin , parity , charge and the valence quark content . more specific , in case of d - mesons or b - mesons we need to analyze correlators of heavy - light - quark currents .",
    "ope s of such heavy - light - quark current - current correlators have been evaluated since the early days of qcd sum rules , see pioneering investigations @xcite .",
    "one of the main peculiarities within the calculation of the ope for a pseudoscalar heavy - light - quark meson correlator is the absorption of infrared mass divergences which occur in the wilson coefficients . in order to render the ope finite",
    ", these divergences have to be absorbed into the condensates by introducing non - normal - ordered condensates , like @xmath41    instead of normal - ordered ones .",
    "the unique mathematical scheme behind is the approach of operator mixing which allows for a consistent separation of scales .",
    "this problem has been worked out in detail in @xcite , and accounts for a perturbative piece of the condensates , cf .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the vacuum case .    at non - vanishing baryonic densities",
    "the ope differs from the vacuum case and additional mass singularities occur . in order to treat them consistently",
    "one has to find additional expressions which reproduce the vacuum limit but also render the in - medium ope infrared stable .",
    "a crucial point is the mixing of different condensates under this procedure .",
    "the in - medium ope for open charmed mesons has been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the results and wilson coefficients presented in these references significantly differ from each other .",
    "moreover , it is not clear in which way the authors have dealt with the infrared mass singularities .",
    "however , the knowledge of the correct ope is compelling for a reliable prediction of in - medium properties of d - mesons within the qsr approach .",
    "recently , in @xcite an ope for heavy - light currents in medium has been presented where the operator mixing and cancellation of infrared simgularities were correctly taken into account , but no further details of the involved evaluation of the ope were given . in view of the progressing in - medium d - meson physics , both experimentally and theoretically , it is timely to present a transparent and thorough calculation of the ope for d - mesons in matter and a comprehensive representation of the techniques which have to be applied .",
    "the pseudoscalar b - mesons are also heavy - light - quark systems and their quark structure is : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "so far , the only application of the qsr approach has been performed in @xcite in order to determine in - medium modifications of b - mesons . since the formalism of ope and qsr can easily be extended from d - mesons to the case of b - mesons , we will incorporate these mesons in our investigation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the ope in terms of normal - ordered condensates is calculated in section [ sct : ope ] .",
    "non - normal - ordered condensates and , therewith associated , the operator mixing and the absorption of infrared divergences is discussed in section [ sct : abs_div ] .",
    "the ir - limit , i.e. the limit of a vanishing light - quark mass , is considered in section [ sct : limit ] . in section [ sct : rest_frame ]",
    "the ope is given for the physical situation where the meson is at rest with respect to the surrounding medium .",
    "furthermore , a borel transformation is performed .",
    "a comparison with the results given in several publications is given in section [ sct : literature ] .",
    "the summary can be found in section [ sct : summary ] .",
    "let us introduce the current - current correlator for d - mesons , which is defined as fourier transformation of the expectation value of the time - ordered products of two currents : @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the wick time - ordering , @xmath48 is the four - momentum of the d - meson , and @xmath30 is the groundstate of hadronic matter .",
    "application of wick s theorem to the correlator ( [ eq : correlator ] ) naturally yields the ope in terms of normal - ordered operators and can be written as @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the unit operator , the notation @xmath51 means tree - level matrix elements , and the bar denotes wilson coefficients which correspond to tree - level matrix elements , cf .",
    "the ope of heavy - light - quark currents in vacuum @xcite . from now on we drop the label @xmath51 , i.e. normal - ordered condensates are always on tree - level throughout the work .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the currents in ( [ ope_ir_unstable ] ) are constructed such that they contain the quantum numbers of the particle under consideration , i.e. spin , isospin , parity , charge and the valence quark content .",
    "accordingly , for d - mesons they are given by @xmath52    due to @xmath53 and @xmath54 we obtain , by means of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum operator , the relations @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in isospin symmetric nuclear matter a replacement @xmath59 does not change these four correlators .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider the current - current correlator ( [ eq : correlator ] ) with the current operator of the @xmath60 meson given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : current_d1 ] ) , since the other three correlators @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , can easily be deduced from @xmath64 .",
    "similarly , for the b - mesons the currents read : @xmath65    obviously , we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the ope for the b - mesons can be deduced from the ope of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , since the ope of @xmath71 can be obtained from the ope of @xmath60 by the replacements @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we conclude that the ope of all heavy - light - quark pseudoscalar currents can be deduced from the ope of the @xmath60 meson ; therefore , from now on we will drop the explicit notation @xmath60 .    in this section , we will determine the wilson coefficients of ( [ ope_ir_unstable ] ) .",
    "the ope contains all operators up to mass dimension 5 : @xmath74    where the flavor of the quark - fields are either charm or down quarks , the dirac indices are denoted by @xmath75 , and the operators have to carry a colorless structure ; for notation see appendix [ sct : not ] . in what follows",
    ", we will calculate all wilson coefficients at first non - trivial order in powers of the qcd coupling constant , except for the unity operator where we include @xmath76 corrections .    as we will see in this section , the wilson coefficients of ( [ ope_ir_unstable ] ) are divergent in the limit of a vanishing light - quark mass @xmath77 , which is a so - called ir - divergency .",
    "the reason for this divergence is that a proper factorization of short and long distance contributions in the ope requires the calculation of matrix elements at the same order as the wilson coefficients .",
    "this special issue will be the topic of the next section . in this section",
    "we will consider the ope ( [ ope_ir_unstable ] ) , i.e. in terms of normal - ordered operators .    by inserting the current ( [ eq : current_d1 ] ) into ( [ eq : correlator ] ) and applying wick s theorem to the current - current correlation function @xmath78 we obtain : @xmath79    where the notation @xmath80 means trace over dirac- and color - indices .",
    "the point of the whole ope is that the quark and gluon fields are separated into a hard and a soft part .",
    "the hard part can be treated perturbatively .",
    "the soft part can not be calculated in this way , but being soft one can taylor expand the spatial dependence of the fields and relate it to local condensates .",
    "accordingly , the term @xmath81 is decomposed into a perturbative part , which is proportional to unit matrix and is treated by standard perturbation theory of qcd , and a gluonic part where the gluon fields are soft : @xmath82    the terms @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 describe the non - perturbative part of the correlator .",
    "the labels @xmath51 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the number of non - contracted quark fields , i.e. the number of quarks which participate in the formation of a condensate .",
    "the term @xmath86 concerns only the soft part of all operators .",
    "thus there is no flow of hard momentum .",
    "the result of the integral in ( [ eq : wick_theorem_3 ] ) is proportional to dirac s delta - function @xmath89 and derivatives thereof , i.e. @xmath86 vanishes except for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore at large @xmath91 ( ope ) there is no contribution from this term .",
    "the quark propagator in a weak gluonic background field in coordinate space reads ( @xmath92 is either @xmath93 or @xmath94 ) @xmath95    where @xmath96 denotes the free propagator and hat a contraction with dirac matrices @xmath97 . for our investigation we need the quark propagator up to order @xmath98 , given explicitly by eqs .",
    "( [ quark_propagator_10 ] ) - ( [ quark_propagator_20 ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we will determine the wilson coefficients of ( [ eq : wick_theorem_1 ] ) - ( [ eq : wick_theorem_2_c ] ) , while ( [ eq : wick_theorem_3 ] ) does not contribute at large @xmath91 .",
    "the perturbative part is the wilson coefficient of the unit operator ( [ operator_0 ] ) , and is given by @xmath100    note , there is neither a normal - ordering nor an expectation value , since in perturbative qcd the propagator is a usual c - number .",

    "we will not finish this paragraph without a final remark about the dispersion relation ( [ im_pert_5 ] ) . according to ( [ im_pert_10 ] ) , the dispersion relation ( [ im_pert_5 ] )",
    "gives an infinite result in ultraviolet regions of integration , i.e. one might prefer a twice - subtracted dispersion relation instead of ( [ im_pert_5 ] ) .",
    "such a subtraction scheme yields polynomials in the external momentum @xmath110 .",
    "however , after a borel transformation has been performed , all polynomials disappear , that means a borel transformation of a twice - subtracted dispersion relation is identical to a borel transformation of ( [ im_pert_5 ] ) .",
    "let us turn to the gluonic part , eqs .",

    "first we note , that by inserting the expressions ( [ quark_propagator_10 ] ) - ( [ quark_propagator_20 ] ) into ( [ gluonic_part_a ] ) - ( [ gluonic_part_c ] ) we recognize that these three integrals are ultraviolet finite .",
    "we also note , that inserting higher orders of the quark propagator , e.g. @xmath114 , or the gluon fields would lead to higher dimensional gluon condensates , such as @xmath115 , or , by usage of the equations of motion , to quark and mixed quark - gluon condensates .",
    "these terms are either of higher mass dimension or of higher orders in @xmath76 , so we omit such terms .    at this stage of our investigation",
    "we would like to mention that the calculation of the gluonic part @xmath83 is performed at the one - loop level and leads to cumbersome expressions .",
    "some details of the evaluation are therefore shifted to appendix [ gluonic_terms ] , where we have described in detail the techniques by means of which we obtain the following final result for the terms ( [ gluonic_part_a ] ) - ( [ gluonic_part_c ] ) : @xmath116    here , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 is the four - velocity of the surrounding medium .",
    "the first line in ( [ pi_g2 ] ) is the scalar contribution which does not vanish in vacuum , while the other term is a medium - specific condensate and vanishes at zero density .",
    "one immediately observes an ir - divergergent term @xmath119 known from the vacuum ope of d - mesons , while in medium there is an additional logarithmic ir - singularity @xmath120 .",
    "these both ir singularities appear because in the corresponding diagram ( right diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram_gluon ] ) there are three light - quark propagators with the very same momentum , while in the other diagrams there are only one or two .",
    "we note the symmetry of ( [ gluonic_part_a ] ) - ( [ gluonic_part_c ] ) in exchanging the charm and down quark .",
    "however , since we have to perform the ir - limit @xmath77 after operator mixing , we have taken into account the leading ir - divergent terms only , that means @xmath121 and @xmath120 .",
    "hence , the solution ( [ pi_g2 ] ) is no longer symmetric in exchanging down and charm quark . in appendix [ gluonic_terms ] further details",
    "are given about how the needed expansions in terms of a small d - quark mass destroy this kind of symmetry .",
    "furthermore , terms of the form @xmath122 and @xmath123 occur simultaneously and can not be made small at the same time for @xmath124 .",
    "however , as has been found in @xcite , they are remnants of the large distance behavior , i.e. they originate from the small momentum contribution to the loop integrals .",
    "their occurrence breaks the neat separation of scales , which is a necessary feature of every ope , and must therefore be absorbed into the condensates . in @xcite",
    "the author argues that these logarithms do not occur when the wilson coefficients are calculated within a minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "moreover , they can be absorbed into the condensates if one reexpresses normal - ordered condensates , which naturally emerge if one applies wick s theorem to ( [ eq : correlator ] ) , by so - called non - normal - ordered ones .",

    "let us now consider the term ( [ eq : wick_theorem_2_d ] ) , which leads to condensates which contain down - quarks .",
    "after expanding the light - quark fields and performing the fourier transformation we obtain the expression @xmath126    the quark fields and their covariant derivatives have to be calculated at the origin , i.e. @xmath127 . from here we can go to higher quark field derivatives or to higher orders in the perturbative propagator or to higher orders in the gluon field , which enters through the perturbative quark propagator .",
    "the quark fields are of mass dimension @xmath128 .",

    "this assumption can be justified as follows .",
    "according to the approximation of the in - medium state @xmath141 , we can split the term ( [ before_lorentz_projection_c ] ) into a vacuum part and a nucleon part : @xmath142 .    at first , let us consider the vacuum part : @xmath143 . in vacuum , the only non - vanishing term in the limit",
    "@xmath77 reads : @xmath144    we insert the operator mixing relation ( [ physical_condensates_2c ] ) for the vacuum situation , and obtain the expression @xmath145 in terms of non - normal ordered condensates @xmath146    where we also have used the projection of the lorentz structure for the vacuum case : @xmath147 ; cf .",
    "( [ projection2a ] ) for the corresponding in - medium projection .",
    "now we apply the heavy - quark mass ( hqm ) expansion , which is an expansion of a heavy quark condensate in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass , and for the scalar charmed condensate in vacuum it is given by @xcite : @xmath148    the idea behind the hqm expansion is , that the interaction of the heavy quarks with the qcd vacuum mainly happens via gluon interactions , because the quark itself is too heavy to couple directly to a condensate .",
    "hence , the heavy quark condensates are expressed in terms of gluon condensates .",
    "obviously , by inserting ( [ hqe_1 ] ) into ( [ before_lorentz_projection_c_vacuum_2 ] ) we recognize that both the additional gluon condensate and the logarithmic term which appear in ( [ before_lorentz_projection_c_vacuum_2 ] ) are exactly cancelled by the hqm expansion .",
    "this statement of cancellation can also be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the nucleon part : @xmath149 .",
    "the charmed condensates in a nucleon are negligibly small @xcite , since they contribute in nucleon only via virtual effects ; in this respect , to generate an easily interpreted image we recall the tamm - dancoff approach @xcite where the nucleon consists of a valence quark core of up and down quarks accompanied by a cloud of virtual mesons which accounts for the virtual sea quarks ( e.g. charm quarks ) and gluons .",
    "thus , we can neglect the in - medium charmed condensates . finally we note , that it is almost certain for us that the described cancellation of charmed condensates in vacuum via hqm expansion can be generalized to the in - medium charmed condensates , but a detailed proof needs special care and would spoil the intention of our paper .    in summary of this section",
