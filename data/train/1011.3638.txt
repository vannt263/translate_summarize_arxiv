    "stochastic processes such as recurrent events and repeated measurements are often collected in medical follow - up studies in addition to survival data .",
    "examples include recurrent hospitalizations , medical cost processes , repeated quality of life measurements and cd4 counts .",
    "such processes often exhibit certain terminal behavior during a short time before failure events .",
    "for example , medical costs tend to increase suddenly before death , qualities of lives deteriorate before death and cd4 counts decrease before aids diagnosis .",
    "conventional statistical methodologies mainly focus on stochastic processes that are counting forward from initial events observed for every individual ; see nelson ( @xcite ) , pepe and cai ( @xcite ) , lawless and nadeau ( @xcite ) , cook and lawless ( @xcite ) , lin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and wang , qin and chiang ( @xcite ) , among others , on recurrent event processes , lin ( @xcite ) on medical cost processes and pawitan and self ( @xcite ) on cd4 count processes .",
    "the conventional views of stochastic processes , however , are not designed to study the terminal behavior of processes .",
    "consider medical cost as an example .",
    "calculating the mean of cost processes for a population defined at an initial event would include both survivors and nonsurvivors at any fixed time after the initial event , and the increase in medical cost based on survivors cost measurement is offset by nonsurvivors who do not contribute to the increase in medical cost after death . unless the failure times are constant over a population , conventional forward processes do not serve the purpose of estimating the terminal behavior of stochastic processes .    in this paper",
    "we directly consider stochastic processes before failure events of interest , by introducing backward processes that start at failure events and counting backward in time . by aligning the origins of the processes to failure events , terminal behavior of stochastic processes",
    "could be naturally and directly studied by the backward processes .",
    "we will focus on one - sample nonparametric estimation of the mean of backward processes when the failure events are partially observed subject to left truncation and right censoring .",
    "since failure events and processes right before failure events may not be observed , statistical methods are needed to correct a bias induced by missingness .",
    "development of methods rely on a stochastic representation technique of a marked counting process generalizing that of huang and louis ( @xcite ) and the proposed estimator also generalizes a weighted estimator for left truncated and right censored data proposed by gross and lai ( @xcite ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we will consider medical costs as motivating examples .",
    "the seer  medicare linked data provide illustrative examples of medical cost process data collected in a left truncated and right censored follow - up sample .",
    "the surveillance , epidemiology and end - results ( seer)medicare linked data are population - based data for studying cancer epidemiology and quality of cancer - related health services . the seer  medicare linked data consist of a linkage of two large population - based databases , seer and medicare .",
    "the seer data contain information of cancer incidence diagnosed between 1973 and 2002 .",
    "the medicare data contain information on medical costs between 1986 and 2004 .",
    "the linked data consist of cancer patients in the seer data who were enrolled in medicare during the study period of the medicare data .",
    "details of each data and linkage are discussed in warren et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "although the linkage criterion sounds simple , it creates a left truncated and right censored sample because the two data sets have different starting times . in the seer  medicare linked data , patients diagnosed with cancer before 1986 form a prevalent cohort , because only those patients who survived through 1986 were included .",
    "patients diagnosed with cancer after 1986 form an incident cohort , because those patients were recruited at the onset of disease .",
    "patients survived through 2004 were considered censored .",
    "a prevalent cohort is typically a left truncated and right censored sample and data from a combination of incident and prevalent cohorts are also left truncated and right censored .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] we will introduce backward processes to study terminal behavior of stochastic processes and discuss the differences from conventional forward process models . the proposed methods for estimating the mean function of backward processes will be discussed in section  [ sec3 ] , together with identifiability problems associated with incomplete follow - up , large sample properties of the proposed estimators and a method for constructing confidence bands for mean functions .",
    "we will also discuss two related extensions of the proposed procedure in section [ sec4 ] , one is on distributional estimation of the backward processes , and the other is on estimation of derivatives of backward mean functions .",
    "simulations and real examples analyzing a seer  medicare linked data set will be presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "section [ sec6 ] will include several concluding remarks .",
    "let @xmath0 be a stochastic process with bounded variation , where @xmath1 is the time after an initial event , usually defined as the time of disease onset .",
    "we call @xmath2 a forward stochastic process since the time index @xmath1 in @xmath0 starts at the initial event and moves forward with calendar time . on the other hand ,",
    "a backward stochastic process is defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time from the initial event to a failure event of interest and the time origin for @xmath5 is the failure event . in the medical cost example , @xmath0 is total medical cost within @xmath1 time units after the initial event , and @xmath5 is total medical cost during the last @xmath6 time units of life .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the trajectories of forward and backward cost processes for 3 uncensored individuals in the seer  medicare linked data .        in figure  [ fig1 ] we can see an increase in medical cost a short period before death . to study this terminal behavior of medical cost processes ,",
    "it is natural to align the processes to a different time origin , the failure event , as shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) . since terminal behavior of stochastic processes",
    "usually incur during a short time period before death , relevant scientific questions center on a rather short period @xmath7 before death , say , 6 months or 1 year .",
    "@xmath7 is a prespecified time period related to scientific questions of interest .",
    "the backward stochastic processes at @xmath7 time units before failure events are only meaningfully defined for a subgroup of patients who survive at least @xmath7 time units , and the estimand of interest is @xmath8 , for @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "however , due to limited study duration , only a conditional version @xmath10 can be nonparametrically identified , where @xmath11 depends on study design and data availability .",
    "@xmath11 can be taken as the maximum follow - up period , and the time period of interest @xmath7 is usually much shorter than @xmath11 .",

    "denotes a time index counting forward from initial events and @xmath6 denotes a time index counting backward from failure events .",
    "the processes @xmath0 and @xmath5 address different scientific questions and have different interpretations .",
    "consider the medical cost example , where @xmath0 measures medical cost from an initial event .",
    "note that @xmath0 will not increase after death , so that @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the interpretation of forward mean function @xmath14 is generally confounded with survival performance .",
    "for example , if there are two groups of patients with the same spending per unit time when alive but different survival distributions , the group with longer survival time will have a higher mean forward cumulative cost .",
    "there may also be crossovers between mean forward cost curves , because patients with severe disease tend to spend more near disease onset but die in shorter time than patients with less severe disease .",
    "we shall see such an example from the seer ",
    "medicare data set in section [ sec5.2 ] . on the other hand , the time origin of a backward process @xmath5 is defined to be a failure event , and the backward mean function can be interpreted as the mean of stochastic processes before failure events . in the medical cost example , when financial decision is a major concern ( e.g. , decision made by insurance company ) , then discounted forward cost may be more relevant .",
    "the backward processes essentially answer different types of questions related to end - of - life cost , and there is currently a lot of public health interest in comparing and evaluating palliative care",
    ". this work could provide valid statistical methods for public health researchers interested in estimating end - of - life medical cost , together with other applications .",

    "are observed only when @xmath20 , that is , the failure time is left truncated .",

    "in fact , @xmath27 and @xmath4 are allowed to be arbitrarily dependent under this assumption and thus handle the case of informative failure events .",
    "the assumption is similar in nature to those imposed for nonparametric estimation of forward mean function with informative terminal events ; see , for example , lawless and nadeau ( @xcite ) , lin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , strawderman ( @xcite ) and ghosh and lin ( @xcite ) .",

    ". for subjects in a prevalent cohort , backward process data may not be fully available for individuals who experience failure events within @xmath7 from recruitment . in this case",

    "this is equivalent to artificially truncating a small portion of data and it guarantees that @xmath35 $ ] , is observable for all uncensored observations with @xmath36 in the prevalent cohort .      a backward stochastic process can be viewed as a marked process attached to a failure event .",
    "this is a generalization of marked variables considered by huang and louis ( @xcite ) in which random variables are observed at failure events .",
    "because of limited study duration , marginal distribution of marked variables can not be fully identified nonparametrically .",
    "the same applies to backward stochastic processes because we do not have data on backward processes for subjects with survival time greater than @xmath11 , which is the maximum support of the censoring time . in view of this identifiability problem , together with the fact that stochastic processes within a prespecified time period of interest @xmath7 before failure events are only meaningfully defined for the subgroup of individuals who survives at least @xmath7 time units , we confine ourselves to estimate a conditional version of backward mean function , @xmath37 , for @xmath38 $ ] .",

    "an important implication of using prevalent cohort data is that it allows us to identify a larger portion , possibly all , of the right tail of the survival distribution .",

    "for all three groups of patients , the full right tail of survival distributions can be identified when the full data set is considered , but not in the case when we only analyze the incident cohort .",

    "when we include prevalent cohort data in the analysis , we can estimate @xmath8 nonparametrically .",
    "we propose an estimator for the backward mean function @xmath39 by using marked counting process arguments extending those of huang and louis ( @xcite ) .",
