    "x - ray and gamma - ray astronomers frequently consider the crab supernova remnant to be a steady standard candle suitable as a calibration source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite presented over 5 years of the spectrometer on _ integral _  ( spi , 20 kev - 8 mev ) observations , with fitted flux normalizations at 100 kev consistent with being constant to within the @xmath3% quoted errors .",
    "on the basis of data from _ xmm - newton _ , _ integral _ , _ swift _ , _ chandra _ , _ rxte _ , and several earlier missions , @xcite have concluded that the crab flux can be described at least up to 30 kev by the same spectrum proposed by @xcite three decades earlier : @xmath4 , i.e. they describe the crab as a standard candle .",
    "driven by the central pulsar s spin - down luminosity , the surrounding remnant consists of a cloud of expanding thermal ejecta and a synchrotron nebula @xcite with an integrated luminosity @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the pulsar provides a shocked wind that accelerates electrons and positrons to energies @xmath7 gev and a source of kinetic energy driving turbulent motion of a ring of wisps nearly surrounding the synchrotron nebula .",
    "high resolution observations reveal wisps and knots moving at velocities up to 0.7  c from radio to x - ray energies @xcite .",
    "a central torus and jet structure extending out from the pulsar were observed in x - rays by _",
    "@xcite , aligned closely with the pulsar s proper motion @xcite .",
    "the nebular emission is considered to be a combination of synchrotron radiation up to @xmath8 mev and a harder inverse compton spectrum extending up to tev energies @xcite .",
    "observations of the 8 ghz nebular flux in 1985 @xcite showed a decrease of @xmath9% yr@xmath6 , consistent with predictions by @xcite for an expanding synchrotron - emitting cloud . at optical wavelengths",
    ", @xcite reported a decrease in the nebula - integrated flux of @xmath10% yr@xmath6 from 1987 - 2002 . at x - ray energies ( 2 - 28 kev ) , 1996 - 2002",
    "_ bepposax _ observations described by @xcite included a 2% systematic error to account for the observed fluctuations in time .",
    "in the 35  300 kev energy region , @xcite reported @xmath11 % variations in the flux observed with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ over periods of days to weeks .",
    "@xcite reported a @xmath12% increase in the unpulsed flux ( 0.75 - 30 mev ) measured with the _ cgro _ compton telescope ( comptel ) between april / may 1991 and august / september 1992 . at the same time , @xcite reported a @xmath13% decrease in the 75 - 150 mev flux and steady emission from 150 mev to 30 gev measured with the _ cgro _ energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) between 1991 and 1993 .",
    "they interpret this as steady compton emission @xmath14 mev from long - lived @xmath15 gev electrons and @xmath16 mev synchrotron emission from shorter - lived 100 tev to 1 pev electrons accelerated by time - variable small - scale shock structures .",
    "a change in this electron acceleration mechanism would drop a portion of the electrons from the range responsible for the egret emission to the comptel range , resulting in the observed fluxes .",
    "the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) found no variations with time in the 100 mev - 30 gev band from 2008 august - 2009 april @xcite .",

    "* ) , and the very energetic radiation imaging telescope system ( veritas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide no evidence for time variability , consistent with expectations for higher energies .",
    "although it is extremely difficult to obtain absolute flux measurements with accuracy @xmath17 % with a single instrument , we have analyzed independent data sets from four separate operating missions . in section 2 , we present the crab light curves measured independently by _",
    "fermi_/gbm , _",
    "swift_/bat , _ integral_/ibis and jem - x , and _ rxte_/pca . in section 3 ,",
    "we summarize the results and discuss their implications .",
    "the gbm instrument @xcite , sensitive from 8 kev to 40 mev , provides nearly continuous full - sky coverage via the earth occultation technique , successfully demonstrated with batse @xcite .",
    "the @xcite approach has been adapted for gbm @xcite . to date",
    ", six persistent and two transient sources have been detected above 100 kev @xcite , including the crab .",
    "the gbm implementation of the earth occultation technique uses both ctime ( 8 energy channels with 0.256-second resolution ) and cspec data ( 128 energy channels with 4.096 s resolution ) .",
    "a detailed detector response model has been developed based on geant4 simulations confirmed by extensive ground testing in order to determine the response as a function of orientation @xcite . in flight , fits to background lines ( e.g. , 511 kev ) over time show a stable gain and energy resolution in all the gbm detectors and electronics , with lines typically within 1% of their expected position .",
    "the crab light curve measured in four energy bands with gbm from august 12 , 2008 through july 13 , 2010 ( mjd 54690 - 55390 ) is shown in figure  [ gbm ] .",
    "with respect to the rate on mjd 54690 , the crab rate appears to have decreased steadily by more than 5% : the decrease is @xmath18% , @xmath19% , @xmath20% , and @xmath21% in the 12 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , 300 - 500 kev bands , respectively .",
    "inclusion of a linear decline in the 12 - 50 kev band improves reduced @xmath22 to 605.8/130=4.66 from 956.3/131=7.30 for a constant crab .",
    "frequent observations with the _ rxte _  pca were made to monitor the radio - x - ray phase of the crab pulsed emission @xcite and for calibration purposes @xcite . in the pca ,",
    "the crab is bright ( @xmath23 2500 counts s@xmath6 detector@xmath6 ) .",
    "unrejected background from all sources amounts to about 1 mcrab .",
    "the pca is a relatively simple instrument , with commanded changes in operating conditions limited to the high voltage .",
    "data since the last high voltage change in 1999 for pcu 2,3 , and 4 are used in this paper .",
    "the pca response has two small time - dependent effects , both accounted for in the response matrices .",
    "first , xenon is slowly accumulating in the front veto layer ( nominally filled with propane ) and reducing the low energy sensitivity with time .",
    "second , there is a small energy drift in the pulse height channel boundaries , so that a constant channel selection samples a slowly varying energy band .",
    "both effects can influence the rate , though flux determinations ( i.e. conversion of count rate to flux ) account for this .",
    "in particular , the correction for changing opacity of the front veto layer is negligible in the 15 - 50 kev band .",
    "our observed changes in the crab rate ( see figure  [ rxte ] ) are more than 5 times larger than these effects combined .",
    "figure  [ rxte ] shows total crab rates for individual _ rxte _  pointed observations . from mjd 54690 - 55435",
    "the crab rate in pcu 2 declined by @xmath24% and @xmath25% in the 2 - 15 and 15 - 50 kev bands , respectively , relative to mjd 54690 .",
    "similar results , variations of 2 - 7% , are seen if the bands are further subdivided . in spectral fits to individual pca observations ,",
    "the power law index softens and the normalization and absorption column gradually increase with time , with no clear correlation with flux .",
    "these light curves were produced using _",
    "rxte_/pca standard 2 data ( 129 energy channel , 16-second ) that were extracted , background subtracted , deadtime corrected using standard _ rxte_recipes and corrected for the known time dependence of the response .    from visual inspection of the _ rxte _  light - curve ,",
    "three evident peaks suggest a periodic or quasi - periodic variation with a period of 1000 - 1500 days . to quantify these impressions we constructed a power spectrum , shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ rxte ] , and conducted a search for periodic signals .",
    "we averaged the corrected 15 - 50 kev pcu 2 rates within uniformly spaced bins , using three bins per year , with the yearly interval where crab can not be observed because of sun constraints occurring in the center of every third bin . a linear trend , which passed through the first and last binned rate , was subtracted from the rates , to limit the bleeding of low frequency power into higher frequency bands .",
    "the power spectrum was then created from the fourier transform of the binned rates .",
    "the lower five points in the plot are from individual fourier amplitudes , with the remainder rebinned to reduce errors .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit to the unbinned power spectrum was made using a power - law model .",
    "the best fit model is shown , which has a power - law index of @xmath26 .",
    "standard pulse search methods such as the lomb test are inappropriate because of the underlying red noise power spectrum .",
    "the test statistic we adopted is the improvement in @xmath22 between fitting the binned rates to a quadratic and to quadratic plus a sinusoid .",
    "the quadratic accounts for the low frequency trend in the rates . since the source power dominates the counting statistics , we use uniform errors in the fits , setting @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the power spectrum model at the middle of the region where a periodicity may be present ( @xmath29 day@xmath6 ) , and @xmath30 the bin width .",
    "as seen in the lower panel of figure  [ rxte ] , a peak in the @xmath31 is seen at @xmath32 day@xmath6 , corresponding to a period of @xmath33 days .",
    "however , its significance is only @xmath34",
    ". a longer history of the crab flux will be needed to determine if this feature is a property of the source , or only a statistical fluctuation .",
    "interestingly , this peak value is consistent with twice the period of 568 @xmath35 10 days found in crab radio timing noise from 1982 to 1989 @xcite .",
    "in the 3.2 - 35 kev band.[rxte_pulsed ] ]    the crab pulsed flux measured using pcu 2 event mode data ( 250 @xmath36s , 129 energy channels , top layer ) is shown in figure  [ rxte_pulsed ] .",
    "although the pulsed flux ( upper panel ) steadily decreases at @xmath37% yr@xmath6 , consistent with the pulsar spin - down , the larger ( several % per year ) variation in the signal is not seen in the pulsed emission and clearly seems to be nebular in origin .      here",

    "[ integral ] isgri and jem - x2 count rates from individual pointings averaged over the 3-day _ integral _  orbit with rms errors are shown .",
    "the isgri data were analyzed with the off - line analysis ( osa ) package @xcite version 9 with the settings used for the _ integral _  galactic bulge monitoring program light curves @xcite . using images from individual pointings , the point - spread function of isgri is fitted .",
    "these images are integrated in a given energy band after gain , offset , and charge loss corrections are performed for each event . a time - dependent effective area correction , usually performed by assuming that the crab flux is constant , has been excluded from these data , meaning that not all systematic effects are taken into account .",
    "known effects include residuals in gain and charge loss corrections , present with an amplitude of @xmath39% , varying on month - years timescales .",
    "similarly , for jem - x , the ad - hoc piecewise linear correction ( added to osa to reduce time trends in the crab flux ) was excluded from the standard osa analysis .",

    "we binned data from individual swift pointings in 50-day intervals , eliminating pointings of less than 200 seconds duration and those in which less than 15% of the bat detectors were illuminated by the crab .",
    "the statistical errors on each data point are small ( 0.1% ) and are dominated by systematic errors .",
    "we estimate the systematic errors to be @xmath43% by assuming that the long term variations in the lightcurve are due to real variations in the crab , and that the shorter term variations around that trend are representative of the systematic error .",

    "prior to this time , the pca measurements show continued variations extending back to @xmath23mjd 52000 , which are not seen with isgri in the 20 - 50 kev band .",
    "we investigated the effect of a change in the default dithering pattern since 2006 march , but found that this can not explain the observed difference .",
    "known systematic errors in isgri energy reconstruction are expected to account for @xmath46% deviations .",
    "beginning at @xmath23mjd 54000 , there is a strong correlation among the results from the four independent instruments with very different signal to noise characteristics and observing techniques : earth occultation , coded - mask imaging , and collimated detectors .",
    "the range of techniques strengthens the case that the variation is intrinsic to the crab .",
    "we found no apparent correlations between these variations and variations in the _",
    "integral_/spi anticoincidence detector count rates or gbm count rates , disfavoring local background condition changes as a possible origin , and further supporting a crab origin .",
    "the pulsed flux stability suggests that the observed variations are nebular .",
    "the observed time variability may be explained by models of the crab pulsar wind flow . in some models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a radial plasma flow in the equatorial plane decelerates downstream of a termination shock located at a radius of about 0.5  lyr and near the inner ring observed in x - rays @xcite .",
    "due to adiabatic and synchrotron losses in the fluid the flow becomes inhomogeneous with large variations in local magnetic field strength .",
    "these magnetosonic waves are relativistic and the variability timescale is roughly the fluid crossing time across the shock diameter or @xmath47 years .",
    "alternatively @xcite , variability on scales of the ion larmor radius may result from cycles of compression of the electron - positron plasma induced by magnetosonic waves caused by the cyclotron instability in the ion orbits .",
    "_ chandra _ @xcite and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite observations of the crab suffer from pile - up effects , making it difficult to monitor absolute fluxes at the level of a few % .",
    "acis observations of the crab were performed from mjd 54135 - 55466 .",
    "nevertheless , both instruments have shown that the spectrum of the synchrotron x - rays grows distinctly softer as distance from the pulsar increases .",
    "since higher energy electrons have shorter synchrotron lifetimes , the spectrum becomes softer as the particles move outward and synchrotron losses grow . alternatively ,",
    "the site of the main particle acceleration or the spectral steepening as a function of distance from the pulsar and shock region may vary with time .",
    "the differential photon spectrum @xmath48 produced by synchrotron - emitting electrons depends on magnetic field strength @xmath49 and photon energy @xmath50 as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the power law photon energy index @xcite , suggesting that the observed change in flux could be produced either by a change in the accelerated electron population or a change in the nebular magnetic field of a few percent .    in summary ,",
    "the widely - held assumption that the crab can be used as a standard candle , suitable for normalizing instrument response functions and for calibrating x - ray instruments , should be treated with caution .",
    "although obtaining absolute calibrations and instrument normalizations at @xmath17% is difficult , the results presented here from four independent spacecraft demonstrate that in fact the nebular x - ray / gamma ray emission from the crab varies at a level of @xmath53% yr@xmath6 .",
    "the variation is seen in the nebular emission , and so apparently results from changes in the shock acceleration or the nebular magnetic field .",
    "we can not predict if the present decline will continue or if the @xmath3 year pattern will persist .",
    "longer baselines and multi - wavelength observations are needed to answer these questions .",
