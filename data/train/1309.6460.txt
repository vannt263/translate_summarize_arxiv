    "the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) is a large spectroscopic survey which observed stars of the milky way ( steinmetz et al . , @xcite ) in the magnitude interval 9@xmath012 in the southern celestial hemisphere .",
    "after ten years of observations , the survey ended in april 2013 , collecting 574,630 spectra of 483,330 stars .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the 1.2 meter uk schmidt telescope of the australian astronomical observatory .",
    "the 150 optical fibres of the 6df spectrograph allowed us to collect up to 130 spectra in one hour of exposure time . with a resolution of r@xmath17500 , the spectra centered on the near infrared ca ii triplet region ( 8410 - 8795 ) yield precise radial velocity ( rv ) measurements ( @xmath22  km  s@xmath3 at s / n@xmath440 ) . beside",
    ", rave provides stellar parameters such as effective temperature , gravity , and metallicity ( zwitter et al .",
    "@xcite , siebert et al .",
    "@xcite , kordopatis et al . in preparation ) , and chemical abundances for the elements mg , al , si , ti , fe , and ni ( boeche et al .",
    "@xcite , kordopatis et al . in preparation ) .",
    "proper motions of the rave stars come from a variety of catalogues , such as tycho2 ( hg et al . , @xcite ) , ppm - extended catalogues ppmx and ppmxl ( roeser et al . ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and the second and third u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ucac2 and ucac3 ( zacharias et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "distances have been estimated with different methods ( breddels et al .",
    "@xcite , zwitter et al .",
    "@xcite , burnett et al .",
    "@xcite , binney et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the kinematic information , combined with the distances and the chemical abundances , enables us to locate the rave stars in the six dimensional phase - space and the chemical space , making the rave database a rich mine for galactic archaeology studies .",
    "+ rave is complementary to the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration survey ( segue , yanny et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact , the two surveys observe in opposite hemispheres , at different magnitude ranges ( segue covers @xmath5 ) , and at different resolution ( r@xmath12000 for segue ) . because of the difference in magnitude , the segue dwarf stars cover a volume similar to the one probed by the rave giant stars , making the comparison of the two samples crucial for the robustness of the results obtained with the two surveys .",
    "we measured the chemical gradients of the milky way along its radius by using a sample of 19,962 rave dwarf stars ( boeche et al . , submitted )",
    "selected to have spectra with s / n@xmath440 , effective temperature 5250@xmath6 , gravity @xmath73.8  dex and error in distance smaller than 30% .",
    "the stars are also classified as normal stars by matijevi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and have little or no continuum defects in their spectra . since the rave dwarf stars cover a small galacticentric distance range ( @xmath10.6  kpc , see fig.[boeche_corrado_fig1 ] , left panel ) a chemical gradient measured by using the actual positions of the stars will be necessarily poorly constrained .",
    "thus , we extended the measurements to the galactic radius range r@xmath14.59.5  kpc by using the guiding radius @xmath8 . to obtain @xmath8 ,",
    "the galactic orbits of the stars have been integrated in the potential model n.2 by dehnen & binney ( @xcite ) . from the rotation curve and the integrated orbits we computed the guiding radius @xmath8 , and extract other orbital parameters such as apocentre , pericenter and maximum distance from the galactic plane reached by the star ( z@xmath9 ) .",
    "+ in order to avoid observational bias and compare the real galaxy with models , we created a rave equivalent mock sample by using the stellar population synthesis code galaxia ( sharma et al . , @xcite ) , which uses analytical density profiles based on the besanon model ( robin et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "the mock sample reproduces the rave selection funcion in i magnitude and the target distribution on the sky .",
    "the same cuts in s / n , t@xmath10 , @xmath11 applied to the rave sample have been applied to the mock sample , which contains 26,198 entries ( see fig.[boeche_corrado_fig1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "we measured the gradients of iron abundance [ fe / h ] of these two samples at three different z@xmath9 values by dividing them in three subsamples : stars with @xmath12 ( kpc)@xmath13 , @xmath14 ( kpc)@xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( kpc)@xmath17 . the results are illustrated in fig.[boeche_corrado_fig3 ] for the rave sample and the mock sample .",

    "the [ fe / h ] distributions of the mock sample are traced with a dashed black line , a dashed gray line and a solid grey line for the thin disc , thick disc and halo stars , respectively .",
    "the overall distributions are represented by a black thin line.,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]    the rave sample exibits a negative gradient of d[fe / h]/d@xmath18  dex  kpc@xmath3 for @xmath19  kpc , and becomes flat at @xmath20  kpc .",
    "this result is in agreement with other previous works ( cheng et al .",
    "@xcite , pasquali & perinotto @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the mock sample shows positive gradients at any @xmath16 .",
    "these unrealistic gradients have several causes : i ) the mock sample has an excess of thick disc stars ( see the [ fe / h ] distributions in fig.[boeche_corrado_fig3 ] , bottom plot , right panels ) , ii ) their mean metallicity appears too low with respect the rave sample , and iii ) because of the larger asymmetric drift and the lower metallicity of the thick disc stars with respect to the thin disc stars , such stars are shifted toward lower @xmath8 and lower [ fe / h ] ( fig.[boeche_corrado_fig3 ] , bottom plot , left panels ) .",
    "the superposition of thin and thick disc stars mimics a positive gradient , the value of which depends on the ratio of thin / thick disc stars in the sample .",
    "besides , the thin disc stars of the mock sample have the unrealistic gradient d[fe / h]/d@xmath21  dex  kpc@xmath3 although the gradient in the actual galactocentric distance @xmath22 ( assigned by the besanon model ) is d[fe / h]/d@xmath23  dex  kpc@xmath3 . this difference is due to the absence of a correlation between the kinematics and the metallicity . in fact , in the real galaxy , stars with high eccentricity are more likely to be metal poorer , whereas in the besanon model the metallicities of the stars are assigned considering their galactocentric distances but regardless of their eccentricities ( i.e. kinematics ) .",
    "the discrepancies between the rave sample and the mock sample can therefore be reduced by i ) decreasing the density , ii ) decreasing the vertical velocity , iii ) increasing the metallicity of the thick disc in the besanon model , and iv ) assigning metallicities to the stars as a function of their kinematics , so that stars in high eccentricity orbits are on average metal poorer .",

    "large spectroscopic surveys face the challenge to process and analyse large databases of spectra in a reasonable time .",
    "this boosts the effort of developing new methods and automated tools for spectral analysis , which are also part of the survey s outcome .",
    "space ( which stands for stellar parameters and chemical abundances estimator ) is one of rave s fruits , since it evolved from the rave chemical pipeline ( boeche et al .",
    "both codes are based on 1d lte ( one dimensional , local thermodynamic equilibrium ) atmosphere models .",
    "the rave chemical pipeline derives chemical abundances from a normalised , radial velocity corrected spectrum , where stellar parameters such as @xmath24 , @xmath11 and a first guess of [ m / h ] are provided by an external source .",
    "space estimates stellar parameters and chemical abundances with no need of extra information but the normalized spectra and a first guess of the spectral resolution .",
    "space does not rely on a library of synthetic spectra , nor does it measure equivalent widths ( ews ) of isolated lines .",
    "instead it relies on a list of lines with astrophisically corrected oscillator strenghts , and on a library of generalised curves - of - growths ( gcogs ) of such lines .",
    "the gcog is a function in the 3-dimensional parameter space ( ps , where the variables are @xmath24 , @xmath11 , and abundance [ x / h ] ) , which describes the variation of the ew of a line in the ps .",
    "when @xmath24 and @xmath11 are fixed , the gcog reduces to the classical curve - of - growth .",
    "space retrieves the ews of the lines from the gcogs of one point in the ps , reconstructs a spectrum model by assuming a gaussian / voigt line profile and varies the stellar parameters and chemical abundances , searching for the model that matches best the observed spectrum via @xmath25 minimization . to date , space works in the stellar parameter ranges of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28(dex)}<0.5 $ ] .",
    "eextensions of the ps are possible . in principle",
    ", space can work in any wavelength range when an appropriate line list and the corresponding library of gcogs are provided . to date ,",
    "space works in the wavelength ranges 5200 - 6200  and 8400 - 8900 . other wavelength ranges will be included soon .",
    "we tested space by using spectra of the elodie spectral library ( prugniel et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) degraded to a resolution of r=5000 and r=20000 , a s / n@xmath170 , and considering only the wavelength interval 5200 - 6200 . at resolution",
    "r=5000 ( fig.[boeche_corrado_fig5 ] ) space gives satisfactory results with @xmath29 errors in @xmath24 , @xmath11 and [ fe / h ] of @xmath1120  k ( with an offset of + 106  k ) , 0.25  dex and 0.10  dex , respectively .",
    "chemical abundances have uncertainties smaller than 0.1 - 0.2  dex ( depending on the element ) and correctly trace the enhancement of @xmath30-elements with respect to iron ( fig.[boeche_corrado_fig6 ] ) . at r=20000",
    "the errors do not seem smaller than the ones at r=5000 ( @xmath31=172  k , @xmath32=0.33  dex , and @xmath33}$]=0.10  dex ) because a not yet identified systematic error in @xmath24 and @xmath11 affects the results .",
    "nonetheless , the resulting chemical abundances look unexpectedly good , highlighting the gap in @xmath30-enhancement between thin and thick disc stars in [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] . more work and tests are needed in order to identify the causes of the systematic errors and to extend the working wavelength range .",
    "once a stable version of the code exists , space will be released to the scientific community as a tool for spectral analysis .",
