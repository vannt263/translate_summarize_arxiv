    "the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory is the basis for a microscopic understanding of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it has , together with band theory , been successful for an understanding of the correlation between the superconducting ( sc ) @xmath1 and material parameters like phonon frequency , electron - phonon coupling , @xmath2 , and the electronic density - of - states ( dos ) at the fermi energy , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the good understanding of the `` gap ratio '' , the ratio between the sc gap , @xmath0 , at @xmath4=0 and @xmath5 , is another example of the success of the bcs theory .",
    "the observation of isotope effects are often in good agreement with the predictions from bcs , which confirms the dependence on lattice stiffness .",
    "although the variations of @xmath1 with pressure can be complex they are usually understood from lattice hardening and the behavior of the matrix elements for electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "however , there are complications @xcite ; competition with magnetism and electron - electron correlation is reducing @xmath1 .",
    "high-@xmath1 cuprates are not understood , since their @xmath2 s are not very large .",
    "the isotope effect is sometimes very complex , even in elementary metals .",
    "other shortcomings might be that the many - body bcs formula does not allow for an intuitive comprehension of the superconducting mechanism and there is no direct explanation of the meissner effect @xcite .",
    "here is presented a simple one - electron like derivation of the bcs gap equation .",
    "many assumptions are the same as in bcs , but some interpretations are different .",
    "the many - body formulation of bcs gap equation is based on exchange of virtual phonons and the sc state appears `` when the energy difference between the electrons involved is less than the phonon energy '' @xcite .",
    "in the present one - particle derivation the gain in electronic energy is caused by dynamic changes of the band structure .",
    "a one - particle band will have a gap because of a periodic potential perturbation , as in the appearance of a gap for semiconductors @xcite .",
    "a spontaneous lattice vibration creates the perturbation and the electronic states at @xmath6 and -@xmath6 are affected equally ( but there is no exchange of phonons ) .",
    "also states on nearby k - points are involved as can be found from the band dispersion .",
    "only phonons which modifies electronic states around the fermi surface ( fs ) are of interest , since changes of the bands far from the fermi energy ( @xmath7 ) make no change in the total kinetic energy .",
    "this puts a constraint on the @xmath8-vectors of the phonons .",
    "the difference between the present derivation and original bcs is that the energy gain is calculated from all one - particle states near @xmath7 , and the sc state appears as soon as this gain is larger than the vibrational energy .",
    "this allows for further insight to the mechanism of sc pairing , since the parameters can be understood in a simple way from the band structure .",
    "phonons and spin fluctuations in the normal ( non - sc ) state are excited thermally following the thermal bose - einstein occupation , @xmath9 , of the phonon- or spin wave dos , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the averaged atomic displacement amplitude for phonons , @xmath12 , can be calculated as function of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "approximate results for debye like spectra make @xmath13 at low @xmath4 and @xmath14 at high @xmath4 , where @xmath15 is an effective force constant , which can be calculated from @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the total energy ) , where @xmath18 is an atomic mass .",
    "the corresponding relations for averaged fluctuation amplitudes of the magnetic moments , @xmath19 , are the same , but without the polarization factor 3 and with replacement of @xmath15 with @xmath20 , which is constant for harmonic dependence of the total energy as function of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus , for the normal state , one can estimate @xmath12 and @xmath19 at any given @xmath4 from these relations , if the force factors @xmath15 and @xmath21 can be calculated or are known from experiment .",
    "phonons and spin waves have an influence on the electronic state and its dos @xcite , and may cause a pseudo gap close to @xmath7 in the normal state of high-@xmath1 copper oxides @xcite .",
    "phonons make a periodic potential perturbation along a chain of atoms , @xmath22 if the phonon propagation is along @xmath23 with wave vector @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "a spin wave makes an analogous perturbation within the spin polarized part of the potential .",
    "the potentials for opposite spins are the same except for a phase shift of @xmath25 .",
    "the result is an anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) spin configuration with wave length given by @xmath26 .",
    "phonons and spin waves can be considered separately , but several works have shown that an important spin - phonon coupling ( spc ) exists in the cuprates , which also can explain many of their unusual properties @xcite .",
    "the following development is based on phonon excitations , but later it will be seen how things will change with spin waves and spc .    at very low @xmath4",
    "there are practically no occupation of phonons .",
    "the fermi - dirac occupation @xmath27 is essentially a step function at @xmath7 ( here @xmath7 is put at zero ) .",
    "the simple nearly free - electron ( nfe ) model , with the periodic potential , leads to a gap @xmath28 in the free electron band at a new `` zone - boundary '' @xmath29 @xcite , and the general band dispersion as function of @xmath30 is @xmath31 if the gap appears at @xmath7 for this particular value of @xmath30 there is a gain in kinetic energy , @xmath17 .    for band energies near the gap it is convenient to express the k - dispersion in terms of a linear @xmath32 measured from @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is measured from the zone boundary at @xmath36 .",
    "the approximation of a linear @xmath32 as function of @xmath35 is valid for @xmath37 , the band width from the bottom of the band to @xmath7 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath38    the normal free electron dispersion , @xmath39 , is recovered for @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , becomes constant and equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the gapped @xmath43 is zero for energies within @xmath44 around @xmath7 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling @xmath2 will enhance the electronic dos for energies @xmath45 around @xmath7 , where it can be written @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the matrix element @xmath47 is zero outside the interval @xmath45 . inside the interval",
    "it can be evaluated as @xmath48 , which is the first order change in energy caused by the perturbation @xmath49 for @xmath50 . for a finite value of @xmath12",
    "the change in energy will be finite and equal to the gap @xmath51 , since @xmath52 is constant for harmonic vibrations .",
    "thus , instead of calculating @xmath47 as a matrix element it is possible to take the value directly from the band gap , and @xmath47 can be written @xmath52 for energies close to @xmath7 .",
    "the separate values of @xmath51 and @xmath12 are important variables , and later it can be verified that the band gap @xmath51 is linked to the sc gap @xmath0 .",
    "the energy of an atomic oscillation consists of elastic and kinetic contributions , but its time dependence , @xmath53 , is a constant in the harmonic approximation . for @xmath54",
    "all the energy is of elastic origin so the cost in energy to generate an atomic vibration can be written @xmath55 , where @xmath12 refers to the maximal atomic displacement . totally there will be a gain in energy if @xmath56 .",
    "the system will spontaneously generate phonons in such a case , and this is the condition for the sc state .",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath17 are the energies per unit cell for which the dos of the normal state is @xmath42 .",
    "the condition @xmath58 is written    @xmath59    for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the dos with the gap and @xmath62 , the dos of the normal state , is assumed constant within @xmath63 around @xmath7 .",
    "the integration is only to @xmath63 since @xmath2 , which will appear later in the equation , is zero for energies larger than @xmath45 .    with a substitution @xmath64",
    "we obtain @xmath65 and ,    @xmath66    with @xmath0 replacing @xmath51 this gives @xmath67    and    @xmath68    since @xmath69 @xcite when the gap at @xmath60 is @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , on one hand it can be argued that @xmath51 has to be equal to @xmath0 , the sc gap , since this derivation then reproduces the bcs result .",
    "but the equivalence between @xmath0 and @xmath51 can also be understood from the fact that @xmath51 is a measurable band gap in the superconductor .",
    "further , a constant @xmath2 implies that the phonon amplitude @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath0 , so that @xmath12 is largest at @xmath4=0 , and @xmath70 when @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the integral and the interpretations look a bit different from bcs @xcite , but the final result for @xmath0 is the same",
    ". any system will generate phonons as soon as the gain in electronic energy generated by the phonon is larger than the energy needed for the phonon .",
    "in reality other more subtle effects , electron - electron correlation energy and potential terms will be added to the energy costs and those terms will prevent a sc gap in many systems .",
    "a numerical solution needs some care for the diverging part of @xmath43 , but models with non - constant @xmath42 and with larger ratios of @xmath73 can be studied .",
    "the model for finding @xmath1 is obtained from eq .",
    "[ eqn4 ] , but with the fermi - dirac function as the @xmath4-dependent weight factor for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and with the integration in the interval [ @xmath77 .",
    "thus , at @xmath1 it is required that the phonon energy is equal to the difference between the kinetic energy of the gapped and the normal electronic dos , but with the constraint that @xmath74 0 .",
    "this is solved numerically from    @xmath78    or    @xmath79    where    @xmath80    for @xmath74 0 . the  in the first integral means that the energies where @xmath81 are excluded .",
    "a factor of @xmath82 is extracted from the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqn8 ] and combined with @xmath42 and @xmath83 on the left hand side to give @xmath2 as before .    the original bcs expression for @xmath1 , which is derived from @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the coupling constant @xcite ) is independent of @xmath0 . here",
    ", we solve this equation numerically with the same precision as the one - particle expression for very small @xmath0 .",
    "the results , shown in fig .",
    "1 , tend towards the analytic solution of eq .",
    "[ eqn11 ] , the well - known bcs formula , which can be written    @xmath86    when @xmath87 .",
    "for example , it can be verified from this formula and fig [ fig1 ] that a @xmath2 of 0.5 makes @xmath88 15 mev when @xmath89 is 100 mev .",
    "a non - constant dos is considered by solving eq .",
    "[ eqn9]-[eqn10 ] with the @xmath76 directly from eq .",
    "2 with @xmath89 being a large fraction of @xmath90 .",
    "the requirement of constant number of electrons as function of @xmath4 in the normal and sc state makes the numerical stability more difficult .",
    "but the results indicate that @xmath1 is lower if the non - constant ( free electron like ) dos is included in the integrations over @xmath91 compared to the result with a constant dos .     as function of @xmath92 as obtained for eq .",
    "[ eqn11 ] , i.e. the numerical bcs result for @xmath89=0.1 ev .",
    "the thin and broken lines show the corresponding result from eqs .",
    "[ eqn9]-[eqn10 ] , for 5 different @xmath0 s ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 mev ) .",
    "the result for the smallest @xmath0 is indistinguishable from the bcs result over this temperature range . , width=302,height=226 ]    for afm spin waves there is a cost in magnetic energy , which in the harmonic approximation can be written @xmath93 .",
    "the change in potential on some site , @xmath94 , is positive for one spin and negative for the other spin direction .",
    "this defines a @xmath95 as a coupling constant for spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the rest of the equations are valid with @xmath96 replacing @xmath2 and with @xmath97 being the energy of the spin wave .",
    "as was mentioned above , typical atomic displacements and magnetic moments from phonons and spin waves in the normal state can be determined from thermal excitations via the effective force constants @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "magnetic moments , with a tendency for a pseudogap in the dos , are driven by thermal excitations , but the left hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqn8 ] is larger than the right hand side .",
    "however , the situation might be reversed at lower @xmath4 , when @xmath19 is supported by the sc gap . in the sc state @xmath12 and @xmath19",
    "are proportional to the sc gap ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "increasing amplitudes of @xmath12 in superconductors at low @xmath4 should be measurable , but their values are small in conventional superconductors .",
    "for example , in nb , with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xcite and @xmath103 , @xmath104 ( @xmath105 the lattice constant ) will be less than one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath12 from zero - point motion .",
    "the complex fs of d - band superconductors implies a multitude of active @xmath8-vectors .",
    "lithium , which under pressure can have a high @xmath1 and a simple free electron fs , should be more promising for detection of @xmath12 for a few @xmath8-vectors .",
    "copper oxides with high @xmath1 and relatively simple 2-dimensional fs , should have sizable amplitudes of the magnetic moments ( assuming that spin fluctuations are responsible for superconductivity ) , and simple q - dependence .",
    "both the superconducting gap and the pseudogap for @xmath106 are sensitive to spin waves ( or phonons ) with the same @xmath8-vectors .",
    "for instance , fluctuations in form of spin waves and spc in the cuprates are thermally excited at large @xmath4 and contribute to a pseudogap for @xmath107 @xcite . the fact that @xmath19 ( or @xmath12 ) is proportional to @xmath0 shows that these magnetic fluctuations will reappear in the sc state and become stronger as @xmath108 .",
    "this is in line with the observations of increasing peak intensity of spin waves at or below @xmath1 in experiments of inelastic neutron scattering on underdoped ybco @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates of @xmath19 , in the range 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath109 in the sc state and in the normal state at large @xmath4 , are not very precise because of uncertainties in density functional calculations .",
    "however , the q - dependence is not expected to change as @xmath4 goes below @xmath1 , so the results for spin excitations calculated for the normal state in ref .",
    "@xcite can be carried over to the sc state .    the standard propositions for higher @xmath1 is to increase @xmath110 ( through isotope shifts ) and/or @xmath2 ( through higher absolute value of the dos @xcite ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath2 can remain constant and lead to larger @xmath0 if @xmath19 ( or @xmath12 ) is increased .",
    "this might be achieved through anharmonicity so the maximum @xmath19 are increased without large changes of @xmath21 .",
    "another possibility is to modify the way @xmath92 is occupying and depleting states around the sc gap and around @xmath7 in the normal state .",
    "temperature and the fermi - dirac distribution can not change , but different energy variations of the dos near @xmath7 are possible . the effect of a gap originating from a potential perturbation on the real band structure has to be determined and inserted in eqs .",
    "[ eqn9]-[eqn10 ] for sorting out the effects of non - constant dos , @xmath76 .",
    "the case with strong spc in the cuprates leads to large enhancements of @xmath96 for some phonons with particular @xmath8-vectors .",
    "anharmonicity is also expected in spc when the magnetic moments can be enhanced at large @xmath12 , which then lead to mutual softening of phonons and spin waves .",
    "this can be taken into account in quasi - harmonic vibrations as amplitude dependent @xmath21 and @xmath15 .",
    "when the gap at @xmath7 is caused by a few periodicities of phonons or spin waves it might be important to consider decoupled @xmath8-dependencies in the numerical search of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for instance , large @xmath111 for selective @xmath24 on the 2-dimensional fs of the high-@xmath1 cuprates is favorable to d - wave pairing , because the strength of the gap is different at different parts of the fs @xcite .",
    "however , the present derivation does not yet consider the phase of the gap . in direct spc",
    ", the excitations of a phonon and a spin wave are made together , which can make @xmath112 and a large @xmath111 .",
    "indirect , weaker @xmath96 are possible for independent spin fluctuations which are enhanced by the presence of normal thermally excited phonons at large t @xcite .",
    "this relative strength of spc is consistent with effective couplings derived from optical spectra showing that the strongest couplings appear near phonon energies , while weaker couplings exist at higher energies @xcite .",
    "from the discussion about selective q - dependence there is a possible reason to why a weak magnetic field is expelled in a superconductor .",
    "as mentioned , one particular phonon , @xmath24 , is responsible for the gap on the paramagnetic fs at @xmath7 .",
    "a magnetic field , @xmath113 , will split the fs into two , one for each spin ( `` up '' or `` down '' ) , @xmath114 .",
    "if sc gaps should appear optimally on these two fs , it requires two independent phonons .",
    "one produces a potential perturbation at @xmath115 , and the other at @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is determined by the band dispersion and @xmath118 .",
    "the sum of these two potentials is @xmath119 , and therefore , even if there is a modulation given by the cosine function , the effective @xmath24 remains the same and will not fit to the optimal values for the two fs .",
    "the resulting sc gaps do not appear at @xmath7 on the two spin - split bands .",
    "this will reduce the gain in energy of the sc state , as can be seen from a two - level model : suppose that the dos of the sc state consists of two peaks at @xmath120 ( each containing one electron of each spin ) and that @xmath7=0 in zero field .",
    "the kinetic energy in this case @xmath121 a field puts the states asymmetrically around @xmath7 and the kinetic energy for the two spin states ( `` up '' or `` down '' ) will be @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "the result is that @xmath124 for most @xmath125 ( but for @xmath92 and @xmath126 being small in comparison to @xmath0 ) , i.e. the symmetric state with no field has the lowest energy .",
    "[ eqnd ] ) as function of @xmath126 for low , intermediate , and high temperature , respectively .",
    "the values are normalized to 1 for @xmath127 .",
    "these calculations are made with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]    the increasing kinetic energy can also be demonstrated for the approximation of a constant dos by adding and subtracting the field @xmath126 in the fermi - dirac function .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the energy difference , @xmath130 , of kinetic energy for the gapped superconducting dos with and without field , which is calculated as :    @xmath131    when @xmath132 for low and high @xmath4 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath134 as function of the field @xmath126 is because the thermal occupation can be made more efficiently if @xmath7 is closer to the dos peak ( on @xmath43 ) above the gap for `` majority '' and closer to the dos peak below the gap in the `` minority '' states , than if @xmath7 is in the middle of the gap .",
    "thus , the gapped state with @xmath118=0 has the lowest kinetic energy .",
    "this state will be preferred by the system as long as screening of an external field can be made through superconducting currents .",
    "the model shows that the minimum at @xmath127 is less profound for large @xmath4 , or when @xmath92 exceeds about @xmath135 .",
    "the feedback from the transfer of minority to majority spin states and effects of a non - constant dos are not included in the model .",
    "the bcs formulas for @xmath0 at @xmath60 and @xmath1 at @xmath136 are derived directly from the one - particle dos functions of the gapped and normal state band structures .",
    "this allows for an easy comprehension and further interpretations of the sc mechanism .",
    "while phonons and/or spin waves are excited thermally in the normal state , they are generated via the electronic band gap in the superconducting state .",
    "atomic displacements of harmonic vibrations and magnetic moments of harmonic spin fluctuations are proportional to the sc gap .",
    "since the sc gap is closely related to the gap of the perturbed band structure , it will be interesting to consider dos functions in materials with impurities and other defects via supercell calculations ."
