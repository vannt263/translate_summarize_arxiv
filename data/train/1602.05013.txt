    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are mysterious radio transients characterized by short intrinsic durations ( @xmath0 a few @xmath1 ) , large dispersion measures ( @xmath2 , and high galactic latitudes ( @xmath3 ) @xcite",
    ". their physical origin is not identified , but the observational properties place them at distances of at least extragalactic , or even cosmological ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "assuming such large distances , their fluences of @xmath4 or larger suggest an extremely high brightness temperature up to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of frbs is unknown . suggested models include collapses of supra - massive neutron stars to black holes @xcite , magnetar giant flares @xcite , super - giant pulses from young pulsars @xcite , flaring stars @xcite , double neutron star mergers @xcite , double white dwarf mergers @xcite , evaporation of mini black holes @xcite , accretion of a comet by a neutron star @xcite , and so on .",
    "precise localization of frbs through radio interferometry or by detecting counterparts in other wavelengths hold the key to make the breakthrough .    in some of these proposed scenarios ,",
    "frbs are expected to be located in a surrounding nebula @xcite . according to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", frbs may be super - giant pulses from young pulsars , which are probably still within their associated supernova remnants .",
    "magnetars that produce giant flares are usually relatively young , some of which may be associated with supernova remnants @xcite . within the `` blitzar '' scenario ,",
    "@xcite suggested that delay between the birth and collapse of the supra - massive neutron stars can be thousands to even millions of years , so that one may not expect a remnant near the frb site .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the delay time can be much shorter , even thousands of seconds after the formation , so that a small fraction of these frbs may be associated with grbs , and the frbs may be surrounded by a bright `` nebula '' , i.e. radio afterglow of a grb . considering a continuous distribution of the delay time scale ,",
    "it is possible that frbs may be generated inside a synchrotron nebula with various ages .",
    "the existence of a ( @xmath6 ) scattering tail of many frbs @xcite as well as faraday rotation in frb 110523 @xcite also suggest that there may exist a dense magnetized plasma screen in the vicinity of at least some frbs @xcite .    whereas the possible existence of a nebula in the vicinity of frbs apparently did not affect the observed frbs , in this paper",
    ", we consider a hypothesized scenario that some frbs may have interacted with their nebulae , if the synchrotron self - absorption frequencies of those nebulae are above the characteristic frequency of the frbs .",
    "this process may be named as `` synchrotron heating '' ( for the nebula ) or `` synchrotron external absorption '' ( for the frb ) .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) has been extensively studies by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to the contribution from the reabsorption of ssa , the electron distribution would deviate from the original ( broken ) power - law distribution and approach a quasi - maxwellian distribution in the low - energy regime for a steady equilibrium situation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "observations show that the spectra of frbs are quite steep ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical models invoking bunching coherent mechanisms also predict relatively narrow spectra with @xmath31 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one can immediately see that when @xmath70 , eq.([itot ] ) becomes @xmath71 , so that the frb emission goes through the nebula without significant interaction .",
    "the synchrotron heating process is only relevant when @xmath72 .    for @xmath72",
    ", the perturbed nebula electron population would eventually relax to a steady state .",
    "one may estimate the relaxation time of the electron distribution .",
    "after the frb injection , synchrotron heating from the frb disappears , and only ssa intensity from electrons contributes to the coefficient @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath73 . for ssa , as pointed out by @xcite , the reheating time scale is of the same order of the synchrotron cooling time scale , i.e. @xmath74 . on the other hand , before frb injection , since the electron distribution is steady , the time scale for electron injection is also the same order of @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the relaxation time depends on the time scale of ssa , synchrotron cooling and electron injection , which is given by @xmath76^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath77 is the peak lorentz factor of high - energy bump in the electron distribution , and the numerical calculation shows that @xmath78 .",
    "we may also consider the change of the frb spectrum .",
    "after the frb injection , the new self - absorption frequency @xmath79 would be given by @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 for the frb emission , which is significantly attenuated for @xmath72 .",
    "in our calculation , the original frb spectrum is a @xmath32-function . in reality",
    ", it would have a certain band width .",
    "the external absorption process becomes important below @xmath20 , so that it essentially defines a low frequency cut - off of the frb emission spectrum . in any case , the chance to have both an frb and the frb - heated nebula both observed is very low .",
    "with the above analysis , we numerically solve eq.([ke ] ) to calculate the consequence of synchrotron heating of a nebula by an frb . to make the problem relevant",
    ", the nebula should satisfy the following requirements : ( 1 ) the self - absorption frequency should be @xmath82 ; ( 2 ) the frb should be close enough to the nebula so that its effective intensity is much greater than that of the nebula , i.e. @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the source intensity , @xmath85 is the intrinsic intensity of the frb , @xmath86 is the geometrical size of the frb source , @xmath87 is the lorentz factor of the frb emitting plasma , and @xmath88 is the distance between the frb source and the nebula . with these parameters ,",
    "the effective integrated frb intensity is @xmath89 . for the nebula , we assume @xmath90 , which gives a self - absorption frequency @xmath91 , where @xmath92 $ ] is the nebula ssa luminosity .",
    "other parameters are chosen as @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . as a result , one has @xmath97 so that the integrated ssa intensity of the source is @xmath98 , which is @xmath99 .",
    "the results depend on @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we first fix the latter to @xmath102 and investigate the effect of the former . given @xmath103 for our parameters , we vary the frequency of the frb and study the electron spectrum and emission spectrum after the frb injection as a function of @xmath100 ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "one can see that as one lowers @xmath11 , more and more nebula electrons are accelerated .",
    "also the self - absorbed spectrum becomes increasingly stronger as @xmath100 decreases .",
    "the lower the @xmath100 value , the broader the modified spectral peak , since more high frequency emission is enhanced ( fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the enhancement of flux is more significant at relatively higher frequencies ( but not too high ) above @xmath20 .",
    "we found that the enhancement reaches a factor of @xmath104 at @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "next , we fix the value of the characteristic frequency of the frb ( @xmath107 ) , and change the intensity ratio @xmath101 around @xmath108 . similar to decreasing @xmath100",
    ", increasing @xmath101 would lead to acceleration of more electrons .",
    "the self - absorbed emission spectrum also shows a more significant hump feature as @xmath101 increases ( fig.[fig2]b ) .    finally , we consider the modification of the frb spectra due to the absorption of the nebula . as",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the new nebula self - absorption frequency @xmath79 after the frb injection is larger than the original self - absorption frequency @xmath20 before the frb injection .",
    "the frb is subject to such absorption . only at the high - energy band where @xmath109 is satisfied",
    "can the emission escape the source .",
    "the emission at @xmath110 is absorbed and used to accelerate nebula electrons . given a steep spectral index for most frbs @xcite , the escaped emission would be a very small fraction of the total frb flux , and therefore would not be detectable .",
    "motivated by the possibility that frbs may be physically located in a synchrotron nebula in some progenitor models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in this paper we investigate the physical process of synchrotron heating by the frb in a self - absorbed synchrotron nebula .",
    "we show that if the frb characteristic frequency @xmath11 is below the self - absorption frequency @xmath20 of the nebula , the nebula would undergo a sudden brightening , leading to a spectral hump signature near @xmath20 .",
    "the lower the @xmath100 ratio and the larger the @xmath101 ratio , the more significant the heating signature .",
    "identifying such a signature would support the origin of frbs in synchrotron nebulae , such as the super - giant - pulse models for young pulsars @xcite , magnetar giant flare models @xcite , or supra - massive neutron star collapse model @xcite in a relatively young nebula @xcite .    for typical parameters adopted in this paper ,",
    "the relaxation time after frb synchrotron heating is extremely long , reaching a few thousand years for @xmath111 mg . within the observational time scale , this can be regarded as a permanent distortion of the spectrum . identifying the spectral bump feature would then give a strong evidence of frb heating in the nebula . interestingly ,",
    "if the nebula has a stronger magnetic field ( e.g. @xmath112 ) , such as the case of a grb afterglow or the afterglow of pre - frb explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our model would predict a type of radio transient lasting for @xmath113 , which is followed by an exponentially decay to the original nebula flux level due to the relaxation of electrons to the original distribution .",
    "the fraction of frbs that are absorbed depends on the relative @xmath114 ratio and , more importantly , the distribution of nebula @xmath20 with respect to the frb band ( @xmath115 ) : an frb is completely absorbed if @xmath116 , partially absorbed if @xmath117 , and not absorbed if @xmath118 . for the parameters of our calculation , a large nebula luminosity @xmath119 is needed to get a high enough @xmath20 to make our problem relevant .",
    "observationally frbs are in the ghz range , suggesting that these frbs are usually not absorbed .",
    "it is possible that some frbs may have lower peak frequencies , so that they could be absorbed by dimmer nebula .",
    "future surveys of faint , low - frequency synchrotron nebula would constrain whether absorbed low - frequency frbs indeed exist in nature .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the flux of the nebula . for our parameters ,",
    "the predicted nebula flux before frb injection is given by @xmath120 , where @xmath114 is the nebula intensity , @xmath88 is the nebula radius , and @xmath121 is the luminosity distance .",
    "this flux is low , which is comparable to or even lower than the flux of the radio afterglow of an frb itself @xcite .",
    "after frb injection , for an frb and associated nebula with @xmath106 at @xmath122 , the ssa flux from the nebula at high frequency ( e.g. @xmath123 ) would be significantly increase , @xmath124 , as shown in fig . [ fig1]b .",
    "such a nebula may be detectable by the current or upcoming radio telescopes such as australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ) , five - hundred - meter aperture spherical radio telescope ( fast ) , and low - frequency arrray ( lofar ) and vla sky survey ( vlass ) .",
