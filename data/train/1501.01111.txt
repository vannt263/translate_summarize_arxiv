    "we will consider non smooth solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) . in this case although the discrete galerkin method can be implemented directly but this method leads to very poor numerical results .",
    "thus it is necessary to introduce a regularization procedure that allows us to improve the smoothness of the given functions and then to approximate the solution with a satisfactory order of convergence . to this end",
    ", we propose a regularization process which the original equation ( [ 1 ] ) will be changed into a new equation which possesses a more regularity properties by taking a suitable coordinate transformation .",
    "our logic in choosing proper transformation is based upon the formal asymptotic expansion of the exact solution in ( [ 6 ] ) .",

    "spectral galerkin method is one of the weighted residual methods(wrm ) , in which approximations are defined in terms of truncated series expansions , such that residual which should be exactly equal to zero , is forced to be zero only in an approximate sense .",
    "it is well known that , in this method , the expansion functions must satisfy in the supplementary conditions .",
    "the two main characteristics behind the approach are that , first it reduces the given problems to those of solving a system of algebraic equations , and in general converges exponentially and almost always supplies the most terse representation of a smooth solution(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this article , we use shifted gjps on @xmath48 , which are mutually orthogonal with respect to the shifted weight function @xmath49 on @xmath48 where @xmath50 belong to one of the following index sets @xmath51 where the symbol @xmath52 is the collection of all integer numbers .",
    "the main advantage of gjps is that these polynomials , with indexes corresponding to the number of homogeneous initial conditions in a given fide , are the natural basis functions to the galerkin approximation of this problem(@xcite , @xcite ) .",
