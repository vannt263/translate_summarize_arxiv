    "a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a toroidal trap  @xcite is an ideal system to study fascinating properties of a superfluid , such as persistent flow  @xcite , symmetry breaking localization  @xcite , and various rotating states arising from quantized circulations  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of circulation in superfluids originates from the single - valuedness of the wave function , i.e. , the change in the phase of the wave function must be an integer multiple of @xmath0 along a closed path  @xcite .",
    "an angular momentum of a bec in a toroidal trap is therefore quantized if the density is uniform . however , if a density vanishes at a part of the circumference of the torus , the phase can jump at the density defect  @xcite , and the system is allowed to rotate with an arbitrary circulation .    in the present paper , we consider a system of a two - component bec rotating in a toroidal trap  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a situation in which the repulsive interaction separates the two components along the circumference of the torus as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : schematic ] . since the closed path along the torus for one component is blocked by the other component , the quantization condition is not imposed on the circulation around the torus , and the system can rotate at an arbitrary frequency . if we decrease the intercomponent repulsion from this initial state , the two components mix , and the density distribution of each component becomes multiply connected , and consequently , the quantization condition is imposed on the circulation along the torus for each component . during this dynamics , the total angular momentum must be conserved .",
    "nontrivial dynamics is thus expected due to the interplay between the change of the quantization condition on the circulation and the angular momentum conservation .",
