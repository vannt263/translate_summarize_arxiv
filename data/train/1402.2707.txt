    "the rapid increase of mobile traffic  primarily driven by data - intense applications such as video streaming and mobile web@xcite  requires new wireless architectures and techniques .",
    "hcns have attracted much interest due to their potential of improving system capacity and coverage with increasing density . because of the opportunistic and dense deployment with sometimes limited site - planning , hcns have at the same time contributed to rendering interference the performance - limiting factor @xcite .",
    "base station ( bs ) cooperation , which aims at increasing the signal - to - interference ratio ( @xmath0 ) at victim users , is a promising technique to cope with newly emerging interference situations .",
    "bs cooperation has been thoroughly analyzed in @xcite . to address interference issues associated with heterogeneous deployments and to make use of the increased availability of wireless infrastructure , bs cooperation",
    "was also studied for hcns . in @xcite",
    "the authors demonstrated that with low - power bss irregularly deployed inside macro - cell coverage areas , bs cooperation achieves higher throughput gains compared to the macro - cell only setting , and hence as hcns create new and complex cell borders more users profit from tackling other - cell interference through bs cooperation .",
    "the applicability of coordinated scheduling / beamforming ( cs / cb ) cooperation for hcns was studied in @xcite , where it was found that practical issues such as accurate csi feedback and tight bs synchronization required for coherent cooperation may disenchantingly limit the achievable gains .",
    "such practical challenges associated with bs cooperation are by no means unique to hcns @xcite , and hence other techniques with less stringent requirements have been studied as well .",
    "one such technique is non - coherent jt , in which a user s signal is transmitted by multiple cooperating bss without prior phase - mismatch correction and tight synchronization across bss . at the user",
    ", the received signals are non - coherently combined , thereby providing opportunistic power gains .",
    "the standardization interest for non - coherent jt @xcite , is particularly due to its _ lower implementation complexity _ for both the backhaul and the csi feedback @xcite and its ability for _ balancing load _ @xcite ; features of essential importance in hcns @xcite .",
    "besides , analyzing bs cooperation in hcns entails several challenges due to the many interacting complex system parameters , e.g. , radio channel , network geometry , and interference . to make things even more difficult ,",
    "these parameters typically differ across tiers , e.g. , bs transmit power , channel fading or cell association . to address these challenges , _ stochastic geometry _ @xcite has recently been proposed and used for analyzing cooperation in cellular networks @xcite .      in this paper , we model and analyze non - coherent jt cooperation in hcns .",
    "the contributions are summarized below .",
    "* analytical model : * a tractable model for hcns with non - coherent jt is proposed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the model incorporates cooperation aspects of practical importance such as user - centric clustering and channel - dependent cooperation activation , each of which with a tier - specific threshold that models the complexity and overhead allowed in each tier .",
    "other aspects such as bs transmit power , path loss , and arbitrary fading distribution are also assumed tier - specific .",
    "* coverage probability : * as the main result , the coverage probability under non - coherent jt is characterized in section  [ sec : cov_prob ] for a typical user .",
    "the main result has a compact semi - closed form ( derivatives of elementary functions ) and applies to general fading distributions .",
    "we also propose a simple but accurate linear approximation of the coverage probability .    * design insights : * _ load balancing : _ balancing load in two - tier hcns , by additionally pushing more users to small cells in order to let these cells assist macro bss with non - coherent jt , is favorable only to a limited extent . as small - cell cooperative clusters are increased , spectral efficiency gains grow only approximately logarithmically while cell load in those cells increases much faster . at small cluster sizes of small cells , generously stimulating cooperation by channel - dependent cooperation activation yields considerable spectral efficiency gains without consuming much radio resources . + _ intra - cluster scheduling in small cells : _ when cooperation is aggressively triggered , small cells should reuse the resources utilized by non - coherent jt , i.e. , intra - cluster frequency reuse ( fr ) , to obtain cell - splitting gains . in lightly - loaded small cells with less aggressive triggering ,",
    "not reusing these resources , i.e. , intra - cluster cs , is better to avoid harmful interference .",

    "for instance , the @xmath42 for tier-1+tier-2 hcns can be higher than for the case of three tiers .",
    "this is because , in this example , the clustering threshold @xmath65 in tier-3 was chosen relatively high , e.g. , due to complexity and overhead constraints , resulting in a rather unfavorable ratio of interference and cooperation .",

    "importantly , imprudently stimulating more cooperation by lowering @xmath60 and/or @xmath66 increases the @xmath0 , however , possibly at the cost of an overwhelming load increase in the participating small cells . using the developed model ,",

    "can be seen that users closer than @xmath68 to a @xmath2-tier bs request cooperation from that bs .",
    "second , given the stationarity of the user point process , the number of radio resources @xmath69 used for cooperation in a tier-2 cell is proportional to the number of cooperation requests .",

    "the load increase remains small , but rapidly accelerates as more clustering is stimulated through lowering @xmath75 .",
    "interestingly , lowering the activation threshold @xmath76 does not change the load significantly at higher @xmath75 while providing considerable spectral efficiency gains .",
    "an important insight is that balancing load , by stimulating small cells ( decreasing @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) to assist macro bss through non - coherent jt , may be favorable only to a certain extent since the additional load imposed on small cells eventually outpaces the spectral efficiency gains .",

    ", the impact of the two scheduling schemes is moreover intensified by the activation threshold @xmath66 . in hcns",
    ", in particular , intra - cluster fr might be favorable in small cells to obtain `` cell - splitting '' gains .",
    "we next study whether intra - cluster fr or intra - cluster cs should be used in smaller cells using the following metric : switching from cs to fr invokes a resource saving at cooperative @xmath2-tier bss not participating in non - coherent jt .",

    "cs should hence be used when a high @xmath76 is desired in order to additionally profit from muting intra - cluster interference .",
