    "kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is a mainstream electronic structure theory , due to the useful accuracy and high computational efficiency .",
    "formally it is exact , but in practice the exchange - correlation energy component , which accounts for all many - body effects , has to be approximated as a functional of the electron density .",
    "development of reliable exchange - correlation energy functionals for a wide class of problems has been the central task of dft .",
    "many density functionals have been proposed  @xcite , and some of them have achieved remarkable accuracy in condensed matter physics or quantum chemistry or both .    according to the local ingredients , density functionals can be classified into two broad categories : semilocal and nonlocal .",
    "semilocal functionals make use of the local electron density , density derivatives , and/or the orbital kinetic energy density as inputs , such as the lsda ( local spin - density approximation )  @xcite , gga ( generalized - gradient approximation )  @xcite and meta - gga  @xcite . due to the simplicity in theoretical development , relatively easy numerical implementation , and cheap computational cost ,",
    "semilocal functionals have been widely - used in electrunic structure calculations  @xcite . indeed",
    ", semilocal dft can give a quick and often accurate prediction of many properties such as atomization energies  @xcite , bond lengths  @xcite , lattice constants  @xcite , cohesive energies  @xcite , etc .",
    "semilocal dft has achieved high level of sophistication and practical success for many problems in chemistry , physics , and materials science , but it encounters difficulty in the prediction of reaction barrier heights , band gaps , charge transfer , and excitation energies .",
    "a proper description of these properties requires electronic nonlocality information  @xcite , which is absent in semilocal functionals .",
    "nonlocality effect can be accounted for via mixing some amount of exact exchange into a semilocal dft .",
    "this leads to the development of hybrid  @xcite and range - separation functionals  @xcite .",
    "the former involves the exact exchange energy or energy density , while the latter involves the exact as well as approximate semilocal exchange holes .",
    "there are three general ways to develop the exchange hole : one is from paradigm systems such as the slowly varying density  @xcite and one - electron density  @xcite , another is from the reverse engineering approach  @xcite , and the third is from the density matrix expansion  @xcite . however , semilocal exchange holes developed with the reverse engineering approach may not be in the gauge of the conventional exchange hole . in the construction of the semilocal exchange hole",
    ", one must impose the hole to recover the underlying semilocal exchange energy density , which is usually not in the same gauge of the conventional exchange energy density , due to the integration by parts performed in the development of semilocal dft .",
    "examples include the pbe gga  @xcite and tpss meta - ggas  @xcite exchange holes .",
    "many range - separation functionals have been proposed  @xcite , and some of them have obtained great popularity in electronic structure calculations .",
    "semilocal exchange hole in the gauge of the conventional exchange is of special interest in dft . in this work",
    ", we aim to develop an exchange hole , which reproduces the tpss exchange functional . to ensure that our model hole is in the conventional gauge , we not only impose the exact constraints in the conventional gauge ( e.g. , correct short - range behaviour without integration by parts ) on the hole model , but also alter the tpss exchange energy density by adding the tao - perdew - staroverov - scuseria gauge function  @xcite with a modification for improving the density tail behaviour of the original gauge function .",
    "the change in the local exchange energy density does not alter the integrated tpss exchange energy , but it largely improves the agreement of the model hole with the conventional exact exchange hole .",
    "furthermore , the hole model can generate the exact system - averaged exchange hole by replacing the tpss exchange energy density with the gauge - corrected tpss exchange energy density but with the tpss part replaced by the conventional exact exchange energy density .",
    "finally , as a simple application , we apply our semilocal exchange hole to construct a range - separation functional .",
    "this tpss - based range - separation functional yields band gaps of semiconductors and barrier heights in much better agreement with experimental values , without losing much accuracy of molecular atomization energies .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a spin - unpolarized density ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "for such a density , the exchange ( x ) energy can be written as @xmath1 & = & \\int d^3r~ n(\\rv ) \\epsilon_{\\rm x}(\\rv ) \\nn \\\\ & & \\nn \\\\   & = &   \\int d^3r~ n(\\rv ) \\frac{1}{2 } \\int d^3u \\frac{\\rho_{\\rm x}(\\rv,\\rv+\\uv)}{u},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the total electron density , @xmath3 is the conventional exchange energy per electron , or loosely speaking exchange energy density , and @xmath4 is the exchange hole at @xmath5 around an electron at @xmath6 .",
    "it is conventionally defined by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the kohn - sham single - particle density matrix defined by @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the occupied kohn - sham orbitals . according to the expression  ( [ energy ] ) , we can regard the exchange energy as the electrostatic interaction between reference electrons and their associated exchange hole .",
    "therefore , an exchange energy functional can not be fully justified unless the underlying exchange hole has been found .",
    "the exchange hole for a spin - unpolarized density can be generalized to any spin polarization with the spin - scaling relation  @xcite @xmath11 =   \\frac{n_\\uparrow}{n}\\rho_{\\rm x}[2n_\\uparrow]+ \\frac{n_\\downarrow}{n}\\rho_{\\rm x}[2n_\\downarrow].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , in the development of the exchange hole , we only need to consider a spin - compensated density . performing the spherical average of the exchange hole over the direction of separation vector @xmath12 , the exchange part of eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath13 = \\int_0^\\infty   du~4\\pi u^2 \\int d^3r~ n(\\rv ) \\frac{\\langle\\rho_{\\rm x}(\\rv , u)\\rangle_{\\rm sph}}{2u},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the spherical average of the exchange hole defined by @xmath15 this suggests that the exchange energy does not depend on the detail of the associated hole .",
    "re - arranging eq .",
    "( [ energy2 ] ) leads to a simple expression @xmath16 = n \\int du~4\\pi u^2 \\frac{\\langle \\rho_{\\rm x}(u)\\rangle}{2u},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the system average of the exchange hole defined by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the number of electrons of a system .",
    "although the conventional exchange hole of eq .",
    "( [ xhole ] ) satisfies the sum rule , @xmath20 the most important property of the exchange hole , the exchange hole under a general coordinate transformation does not .",
    "nevertheless , its system average always satisfies the sum rule @xmath21 this is a constraint that has been imposed in the development of semilocal exchange hole .",
    "while the exchange energy is uniquely defined , the exchange energy density @xmath3 and the exchange hole @xmath4 are not .",
    "for example , these local quantities can be altered by a general coordinate transformation , or arbitrarily adding the laplacian of the electron density , without changing the exchange energy  @xcite .",
    "the conventional exchange hole is related to the pair distribution function @xmath22 by @xmath23 in general , a semilocal exchange hole can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the shape function that needs to be constructed , with @xmath26 being the dimensionless reduced density gradient , @xmath27 being the fermi wave vector , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the von weizscker kinetic energy density , and @xmath31 is the kohn - sham orbital kinetic energy density given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 are the occupied kohn - sham orbitals with spin summed over .",

    ", the tpss shape function should also approach the pbe shape function , i.e. , @xmath42    among these constraints , ( vi ) is for the conventional exchange hole , while ( vii ) is a constraint used in the development of tpss functional .",
    "these two constraints will be discussed in detail below . in previous works",
    "@xcite , constraint ( vi ) was used with integration by parts and thus is not for the conventional exchange hole , and ( vii ) was not considered .      expanding the spherically - averaged exchange hole up to second order in @xmath39 yields @xmath43 \\nn \\\\ & & \\nn \\\\ & \\times & u^2 + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the laplacian of the density tends to negative infinity at a nucleus , the negativity of the exchange hole in the small-@xmath39 expansion of eq .",
    "( [ smallu ] ) is not ensured .",
    "therefore , we must eliminate it .",
    "in previous works , the laplacian of the density was eliminated by integration by parts  @xcite . in order to model the conventional exchange hole , instead of performing integration by parts , here",
    "we eliminate it with the second - order gradient expansion of the kinetic energy density , @xmath44 which is exact for slowly varying densities .",
    "this technique has been used in the development of tpss  @xcite and other semilocal functionals  @xcite as well as in the construction of electron localization indicator  @xcite .    substituting eqs .",

    "note that @xmath50 .    in the large - gradient limit , the tpss shape function should recover the pbe shape function .",

    "this choice of @xmath56 ensures that the small-@xmath39 behaviour of our shape function is essentially determined by eq .",
    "( [ tpss - shape - expan ] ) , while it merges into the pbe shape function in the large - gradient limit .",

    "they can be analytically expressed in terms of @xmath64 as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 . following the procedure of constantin , perdew , and tao  @xcite for the construction of the original tpss shape function ,",
    "here we determine @xmath68-dependence of @xmath64 by fitting to the two - electron hydrogen - like density , while @xmath69-dependence is determined by the wave vector analysis of the surface energy .    [",

    "so , in the tpss - based range - separation functional of eq .",
    "( [ rsfunctional ] ) , the best value of @xmath72 will be 0 , if @xmath70 is chosen .",
    "since in the range - separation functional , some amount of the exact exchange ( here the long - range part ) in tpssh is replaced by semilocal tpss functional , to compensate for this , we need a value of @xmath71 larger than 0.1 .",
    "then we can find the best range - separation parameter @xmath72 by fitting to some electronic properties . to avoid possible overfitting , here we choose @xmath73 , a value that was recommended by perdew , ernzerhof , and burke  @xcite and adopted with pbe0 functional  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is determined by a fit to the band gap of diamond ( c ) .",

    "the results are listed in tables  [ table4 ] . from tables",
    "[ table4 ] , we can see that , our range - separation functional only worsens the tpss atomization energies of tpss functional for this special set by about 3 kcal / mol .",
    "this error is still smaller than many other dft methods such as lsda , pbe , and pbesol .",
    "reaction barrier heights are decisive quantity in the study of chemical kinetics .",
    "however , semilocal functionals tend to underestimate this quantity . as an interesting application",

    "[ table5 ] , we obserce that our range - separation functional provides the most accurate description of bh6 , compared to other functionals considered .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a semilocal exchange hole underlying tpss exchange functional .",
    "the hole is exact in the uniform - gas limit and accurate for iso - orital densities . then is is interpolated between these two densities through wva on the surface of infinite barrier model .",
    "our numerical test on the ne atom shows that the hole mimics the conventional exact exchange hole quite accurately . in particular , with our new gauge function correction",

    "based on the tpss hole , we have constructed a range - separation functional .",
