    "the celebrated fry - milnor theorem states that a curve in @xmath12 of total curvature at most @xmath3 is unknotted . in the present paper",
    ", we shall emphasize the knotting dimension @xmath13 .",
    "as a key step in his 1950 proof , john milnor showed that for a smooth jordan curve @xmath4 in @xmath2 , the total curvature equals half the integral over @xmath14 of the number @xmath15 of local maxima of the linear  height \" function @xmath16 along @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this is then taken as the definition of total curvature when @xmath4 is only continuous .",
    "the fry - milnor theorem ( even for @xmath17 curves ) follows , since total curvature less than @xmath3 implies there is a unit vector @xmath18 so that @xmath19 has a unique local maximum , and therefore that this linear function is increasing on an interval of @xmath4 and decreasing on the complement . without changing the pointwise value of this ",
    "height \" function , @xmath4 can be topologically untwisted to a standard embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath2 . the fenchel theorem , that any curve in @xmath2 has total curvature at least @xmath20 , also follows from milnor s key step , since for all @xmath21 , the linear function @xmath22 assumes its maximum somewhere along @xmath4 , implying @xmath23 .",
    "milnor s proof is independent of the proof of istvan fry , published earlier , which takes a different approach @xcite .",
    "we would like to extend these results , replacing the simple closed curve by a finite _ graph _",
    "@xmath4 in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath4 consists of a finite number of points , called _ vertices _ , and a finite number of simple arcs , called _ edges _ , which each have as endpoints two of the vertices .",
    "we shall assume @xmath4 is connected .",
    "the _ valence _ of a vertex @xmath24 is the number @xmath25 of edges which have @xmath24 as an endpoint . for convenience",
    ", we shall assume in the first part of this paper that each edge is of class @xmath11 up to its endpoints . in section [ nonsmooth ]",

    "continuous_.    * definitions of total curvature for knots *    the first difficulty , and a substantial one , in extending the results of fry and milnor , is to understand the contribution to total curvature at a vertex of valence @xmath26 . for a smooth closed curve @xmath4 ,",
    "the total curvature is @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes arc length along @xmath4 and @xmath29 is the curvature vector . if @xmath30 denotes the position of the point measured at arc length @xmath28 along the curve , then @xmath31 . for a piecewise smooth curve ,",
    "that is , a graph with vertices @xmath32 having always valence @xmath33 , the total curvature is readily generalized to @xmath34 where the integral is taken over the separate @xmath11 edges of @xmath4 without their endpoints ; and where @xmath35 $ ] is the exterior angle formed by the two edges of @xmath4 which meet at @xmath36 .",
    "that is , @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the unit tangent vectors at @xmath36 pointing into the two edges which meet at @xmath36 .",
    "the exterior angle @xmath40 is the correct contribution to total curvature , since any sequence of smooth curves converging to @xmath4 in @xmath17 , with @xmath41 convergence on compact subsets of each open edge , includes a small arc near @xmath36 along which the tangent vector changes from near @xmath42 to near @xmath43 .",
    "the greatest lower bound of the contribution to total curvature of this disappearing arc along the smooth approximating curves equals @xmath40 .    in the context of the first variation of length of a graph , however ,",
    "a different notion of total curvature becomes appropriate , known as the _ mean curvature _ of the graph @xcite .",
    "the contribution to mean curvature at a vertex @xmath36 of valence @xmath44 , as above , is @xmath45 .",
    "this is smaller than the exterior angle @xmath46 .",
    "if the variation vector field is allowed to be multiple valued at @xmath36 , then the larger value @xmath46 appears instead in the first variation of length .",
    "* definitions of total curvature for graphs *    when we turn our attention to a _ graph _",
    "@xmath4 , we find the above definition for curves ( valence @xmath47 ) does not generalize in any obvious way to higher valence ( see @xcite ) . the ambiguity of the general formula is resolved if we specify the definition of @xmath48 when @xmath4 is the cone over a finite set @xmath49 in the unit sphere @xmath50 .",
    "a rather natural definition of total curvature of graphs was given by taniyama in @xcite .",
    "we have called this * maximal total curvature * @xmath51 in @xcite ; the contribution to total curvature at a vertex @xmath24 of valence @xmath52 is @xmath53 in the case @xmath54 , the sum above has only one term , the exterior angle @xmath55 at @xmath24 .",
    "however , as may become apparent to readers of the present paper , for @xmath56 , this notion of total curvature offers certain problems for questions of the isotopy type of a graph in @xmath2 .    in our earlier paper @xcite on the density of an area - minimizing two - dimensional rectifiable set @xmath57 spanning @xmath4 , we found that it was very useful to apply the gauss - bonnet formula to the cone over @xmath4 with a point @xmath58 of @xmath57 as vertex .",
    "the relevant notion of total curvature in that context is * cone total curvature * @xmath59 , defined using @xmath60 as the choice for @xmath55 in equation : @xmath61 note that in the case @xmath54 , the supremum above is assumed at vectors @xmath62 lying in the smaller angle between the tangent vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 to @xmath4 , so that @xmath60 is then the exterior angle @xmath55 at @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that @xmath20 times the area density of @xmath57 at any of its points is at most equal to @xmath59 .",
    "the same result had been proved by eckholm , white and wienholtz for the case of a simple closed curve @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath57 to be the branched immersion of the disk given by douglas @xcite and rad @xcite , it follows that if @xmath65 , then @xmath57 is embedded , and therefore @xmath4 is unknotted .",
    "thus @xcite provided an independent proof of the fry - milnor theorem .",
    "however , @xmath59 may be small for graphs which are far from the simplest isotopy types of a graph @xmath4 ( see the nearly spherical example following observation [ mc>>nc ] below ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we introduce the notion of * net total curvature * @xmath66 , which is the appropriate definition for generalizing  _ to graphs _",
    " milnor s approach to isotopy and total curvature of _",
    "curves_. for each unit tangent vector @xmath67 at @xmath24 , @xmath68 , let @xmath69 be equal to @xmath70 on the hemisphere with center at @xmath67 , and @xmath71 on the opposite hemisphere ( values along the equator , which has measure zero , are arbitrary ) .",
    "we then define @xmath72^+\\,da_{s^2}(e).\\ ] ] in the case @xmath47 , the integrand is positive ( and equals 2 ) only on the set of unit vectors @xmath62 which have a negative inner product with both @xmath63 and @xmath64 , ignoring @xmath62 in sets of measure zero .",
    "this set is a lune bounded by semi - great circles orthogonal to @xmath63 and to @xmath64 , and has spherical area equal to twice the exterior angle .",

    "one - half the sum of these exterior angles , however , depends on the choice of the euler circuit @xmath78 .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is the union of the @xmath81-axis and the @xmath82-axis in euclidean space @xmath2 , then one might choose @xmath78 to have four right angles , or to have four straight angles , or something in between , with completely different values of total curvature . in order to form a version of total curvature at a vertex @xmath24 which only depends on the original graph @xmath4 and not on the choice of euler circuit @xmath78 , it is necessary to consider some of the exterior angles as partially balancing others .",
