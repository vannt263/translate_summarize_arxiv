    "<S> the energy of quasi - bound states can be determined either by looking at the pole of the scattering matrix@xcite which works well in one dimension or by calculating the dwell time of the incident electron for two or three dimensional systems@xcite . in the case of double @xmath43 barriers structure , </S>",

    "<S> this defines a resonance line @xmath56 in parameter space @xmath2 along which the transmission is at resonance@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is the detuning of the fermi energy from the bound state .    to show the quantization of charge transfer in the ns system , it is useful to recall the calculation of the normal case and make the comparison . in the normal case </S>",
    "<S> the charge transfer is given by@xcite @xmath58    @xmath59   \\label{normal1}\\ ] ]    the pumped charge in this case has been calculated in ref .. in the _ weak pumping limit _ , it is easy to show that only @xmath60 contributes to the pumped charge . in the strong pumping regime </S>",
    "<S> , we will show in the following that the contribution from @xmath61 to the pumped charge in normal structure is zero . as discussed in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , we neglect the smooth energy dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . from eq.([normal1 ] ) , we obtain the contribution due to @xmath61 @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xmath64 to compute the surface integral of @xmath65 in eq.([pi1 ] ) , it is convenient to change the variables from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and @xmath68 :    @xmath69    and @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . substituting eqs.([x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) into eqs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) and expanding eqs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) in terms of small @xmath43 , we have @xmath73 @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 ( an even function of @xmath68 ) is given in eq.(8 ) of ref .. since @xmath76 is an odd function of @xmath68 , the contribution due to @xmath61 to the pumped charge is zero .    </S>",
    "<S> now we follow the same procedure to calculate the pumped charge for the ns system . for the parametric pumping at zero temperature , we only need the scattering matrix at the fermi level , i.e. , at @xmath77 . from eqs.([she ] ) and ( [ me ] ) , we see that @xmath18 is a real quantity and hence makes no contribution to the pumped charge in eq.([q2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to calculate @xmath78 using eq.([see ] ) , from which we obtain , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.1 we plot both @xmath78 and @xmath82 as well as their cross - sections along and perpendicular to the resonance line . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath78 and @xmath82 are peaked around the resonance line . </S>",
    "<S> two features are worth noticing . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the peak of @xmath78 is much sharper than that of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this is understandable and is due to the resonance nature of ns structures near the resonance line . in the breit - wigner form , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission coefficients for normal and ns structures are , respectively @xmath83 $ ] and@xcite @xmath84 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath85 is the resonant level , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the decay widths into the left and right lead . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath88 decays much faster away from @xmath85 than @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering matrix @xmath90 and @xmath18 will appear , respectively , in eqs.([q2 ] ) and ( [ normal ] ) implicitly as can be seen from fisher - lee relation eq.([fisher ] ) and the dyson equation @xmath91@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the peak height of @xmath78 is four times larger than that of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely due to the constructive interference of direct reflection and multiple andreev reflection@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now the physics of pumping at resonance is clear . for the resonance pumping in the weak pumping regime </S>",
    "<S> , we are looking at the small neighborhood of the peak . </S>",
    "<S> the area of the neighborhood has to be small since it is the weak pumping . </S>",
    "<S> the neighborhood has to be around the peak with @xmath92 since only around the peak the transmission coefficient is approximately one . as a result , we obtain immediately the pumped charge or pumped current of ns structure near the resonance is four times of that of corresponding normal structure . in the other extreme , for strong pumping , we take a large contour enclosing entire resonance line . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath78 decreases much faster than @xmath82 away from the peak , it is understandable that the pumped charges ( the integral of @xmath93 over the area enclosed by the contour ) for both normal and ns structures are equal , which will be shown analytically below .    </S>",
    "<S> after the expansion in powers of @xmath43 in eqs.([f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) and keep the leading orders of @xmath43 , we have @xmath94(-1+z)^3 ( 1+z)^4\\frac{\\delta^9}{64}\\ ] ]    @xmath95 \\delta^4\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so eq.([q2 ] ) becomes , @xmath96 using the fact that @xmath97 , eq.([eq1 ] ) becomes    @xmath98    hence the pumped charge for ns system is quantized at the same value of that of the normal structure .    </S>",
    "<S> now we have a better physical picture for the transport properties of the ns structure . for the conductance or the i - v curve , we need @xmath90 or @xmath18 . for normal structure , </S>",
    "<S> the current is given by @xmath99 |s_{12}|^2 $ ] and hence at resonance and at zero temperature @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> for ns structure , we have@xcite @xmath101 and at resonance @xmath102 which is the well known doubling of the conductance . for pumped charge or pumped current at resonance , however , it depends only on @xmath103 or @xmath104 ( @xmath77 is assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> because of the constructive interference between direct reflection and multiple andreev reflection in the _ weak pumping regime _ , the charge transfer increases by a factor of four when one of the lead becomes superconducting . in the strong pumping regime , </S>",
    "<S> however , the charge transfer is quantized at the value equal to that of normal structure , if the pumping contour is chosen such that the resonance line is enclosed . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this can be understood as follows . in the normal case </S>",
    "<S> , the contour enclosing the resonance line in the parameter space passes through the resonance line at two points @xmath105 when the left contact is almost closed and @xmath106 when the right contact is almost closed . when passing through those two points , the resonance level of the dot crosses the fermi energy . at each crossing , the occupation of the level changes , and two electrons with opposite spin enter or exit the region between the barriers . </S>",
    "<S> since one of the tunnel barriers has zero conductance at those points , it is clear that the electrons must have tunneled through the other contact upon entering or leaving the quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the pumping cycle , electrons are shuttled pairwise through the dot . in the presence of superconducting lead , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance level ( both the energy and the width ) is exactly the same as that of normal case since the scattering matrix is given by @xmath107 when @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the same argument applies to the superconducting case and the quantization unit is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that our statement is only valid when the electron interaction is neglected . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of two normal - metal contacts , if interactions are included the quantization will remain , but now the quantum is only @xmath108 : only one electron at a time can enter the region between the barriers ; addition of a second electron is forbidden by coulomb blockade . in the presence of superconducting lead , since the andreev reflection requires two electrons with opposite spin in order to produce the supercurrent , it seems that the pumping is not allowed in the strong pumping regime due to coulomb blockade . in this paper , we have also neglected the effect of temperature and the effect of inelastic scattering . as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature will destroy the quantization of the pumped charge . </S>",
    "<S> when inelastic channel is present an additional physical mechanism for an incoherent pump effect will show up@xcite . </S>"
