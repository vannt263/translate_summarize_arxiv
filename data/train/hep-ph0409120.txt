    "a reliable understanding of bottom quark fragmentation in top quark decay ( @xmath2 ) will be fundamental to accurately measure the top properties , such as its mass @xmath3 , at present and future high - energy colliders .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty on bottom quark fragmentation is one of the sources of systematic error on @xmath3 at the tevatron accelerator @xcite and will play a crucial role in the reconstruction of @xmath3 from final states with leptons and @xmath4 at the lhc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate bottom fragmentation in top decay within the framework of perturbative fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "we shall resum collinear logarithms @xmath5 and soft terms that appear in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) b - quark energy distribution .",
    "we shall present results on the b - quark energy spectrum in top quark decay and investigate the impact of collinear and soft resummation .",
    "hadron - level results on b - flavoured hadrons will be shown in @xmath6 and moment spaces .",
    "in ref .  @xcite nlo corrections to top decay @xmath7 have been computed for a massive b quark , and the differential width @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the normalized b - quark energy fraction in the top rest frame , has been calculated . the differential rate obtained in @xcite exhibits large mass logarithms @xmath10 that need to be resummed in order to improve the prediction",
    ".    such contributions can be resummed by using the perturbative fragmentation approach @xcite , which , up to power corrections , factorizes the rate of heavy - quark production into the convolution of a coefficient function , describing the emission of a massless parton , and a perturbative fragmentation function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the factorization scale . in the @xmath13 factorization scheme",
    "we have : @xmath14^{\\overline{\\mathrm{ms } } } d_i\\left({x_b\\over z},\\mu_f , m_b \\right)^{\\overline{\\mathrm{ms } } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\cal o}\\left((m_b / m_t)^p\\right ) \\ ; , \\label{pff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "the @xmath17 top decay coefficient function has been computed in @xcite .",

    "parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations @xcite once an initial condition at a scale @xmath18 is given .",

    "if we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we resum large logarithms @xmath26 , which are indeed the terms appearing in the massive , unevolved , nlo @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , both the @xmath27 coefficient function @xcite and the initial condition of the perturbative fragmentation function ( [ dbb ] ) present , at @xmath17 , terms that behave like @xmath28 or @xmath29_+$ ] , which become large for @xmath30 , i.e. for soft - gluon radiation . in mellin moment space , such contributions correspond to behaviours @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "soft contributions in the perturbative fragmentation function are process - independent and have been resummed in @xcite with nll accuracy .",
    "soft terms in the coefficient function are instead process - dependent .",
    "resummation of ll @xmath33 and nll @xmath34 contributions to the top - decay coefficient function has been performed in @xcite and we do not report here the formulae for the sake of brevity .",

    "[ parton ] we show the b - quark energy spectrum .",
    "the nlo calculation lies below the two resummed predictions and is divergent as @xmath30 . after the resummation of collinear terms @xmath5",
    "the distribution exhibits a sharp peak at @xmath9 close to 1 .",
    "finally , the inclusion of soft - gluon resummation smoothens out the distribution , which exhibits the so - called sudakov peak .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the implementation of collinear and soft resummation leads to a milder dependence of observables on the factorization and renormalization scales entering the calculation , which corresponds to a reduction of the theoretical uncertainty . as an example , fig .",

    "we note that while the unresummed prediction still exhibits a dependence on the value chosen for @xmath12 , the implementation of soft resummation yields three almost undistinguishable distributions .",
    "we would like to make predictions for the spectrum of b - flavoured hadrons in top decay .",
    "we write the normalized rate for the production of b - hadrons b as a convolution of the rate for the production of b quarks and a non - perturbative fragmentation function @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath6 is the b normalized energy fraction .",
