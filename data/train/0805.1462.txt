    "one of the elegant methods for solving the laplace / poisson equations ( normally an integral expression of the inverse square law ) is to set up the boundary integral equations ( bie ) which lead to the moderately popular boundary element method ( bem ) . in the forward collocation version of the bem ,",
    "surfaces of a given geometry are replaced by a distribution of point singularities such as source / dipole of unknown strengths .",
    "the strengths of these singularities are obtained through the satisfaction of a given set of boundary conditions that can be dirichlet , neumann or of the robin type .",
    "the numerical implementation requires considerable care @xcite because it involves evaluation of singular ( weak , strong and hyper ) integrals .",
    "some of the notable two - dimensional ( while all the devices are 3d by definition , useful insight is often obtained by performing a 2d analysis ) and three - dimensional approaches used to evaluate the singular integrals are discussed in @xcite and @xcite and the references in these papers .",
    "it is well - understood that many of the difficulties in the available bem solvers stem from the assumption of nodal concentration of singularities which leads to various mathematical difficulties and to the infamous numerical boundary layers @xcite when the source is placed very close to the field point ( @xcite and references [ 4 - 6 ] therein ) .",
    "while mathematical singularities ( that occur when the source and field points coincide ) have been shown to be artifacts , several techniques have been used to remove difficulties related to physical or geometrical singularities ( that occur when boundaries are degenerate , i.e. , geometrically singular , or due to a jump in boundary conditions ) such as gaussian quadrature integration , mapping techniques for regularization , bicubic transformation , nonlinear transformation and dual bem techniques @xcite .",
    "the last technique seems to be a popular one and capable of dealing with a relatively wide range of similar problems .",
    "departing from the approaches mentioned in the above references and many more to be mentioned below , we had shown in an earlier paper @xcite that many of these problems can be eliminated or reduced if we adopt a new paradigm in which the elements are endowed with singularities distributed on them , rather than assuming the singularities to be concentrated at specific nodal points . despite a large body of literature , closed form analytic expressions for computing the effects of distributed singularities are rare @xcite , complicated to implement and , often , valid only for special cases @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the integration of the green function to compute the influence of a constant source distribution is modified to an ",
    "n - plane \" integration .",
    "the evaluation of this integration involves co - ordinate transformations and the resulting expressions are rather complicated . in @xcite",
    ", the gauss - bonnet concept is used in which the panel is projected onto a unit sphere and the solid angle is determined from the sum of the induced angles . the procedure and",
    "the resulting expressions are neither simple , nor easy to implement in a computer code .",
    "in fact , possibly due to these difficulties , these approaches have remained relatively unpopular and even in very recent papers it is maintained that for evaluating the influence due to source distributed on triangular elements in a general case , one must apply non - analytic procedures @xcite .",
    "thus , for solving realistic but difficult problems involving , for example , sharp edges and corners or thin or closely spaced elements , introduction of special formulations ( usually involving fairly complicated mathematics , once again ) becomes a necessity @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks are some of the major reasons behind the relative unpopularity of the bem despite its significant advantages over domain approaches such as the finite - difference and finite - element methods ( fdm and fem ) while solving non - dissipative problems @xcite .",
    "the inverse square law exact solutions ( isles ) library developed in conjunction with the nearly exact bem ( nebem ) solver @xcite , in contrast , is capable of truly modeling the effect of distributed singularities precisely and , thus , is not limited by the proximity of other singular surfaces or their curvature or their size and aspect ratio .",
    "the library consists of analytic solutions for both potential and flux due to uniform distribution of singularity on flat rectangular and triangular elements .",
    "these close - form exact solutions , termed as _ foundation expressions _ , are in the form of algebraic expressions that are long but without complications and are fairly straight - forward to implement in a computer program . in deriving these foundation expressions , while the rectangular elements were allowed to be of any arbitrary size @xcite , the triangular element was restricted to be a right angled triangle of arbitrary size @xcite . since any real geometry can be represented through elements of the above two types ( or by the triangular type alone ) , this library has allowed us to develop the nebem solver that is capable of solving three - dimensional potential problems involving arbitrary geometry .",
    "it may be noted here that any non - right - angled triangle can be easily decomposed into two right - angled triangles .",
    "thus , the right - angled triangles considered here , in fact , can take care of any three - dimensional geometry .",
    "a set of particularly difficult problems to be dealt with by bem is one that contains corners and edges and , in this work , we will attempt to solve several problems belonging to this set .",
    "the perfectly conducting bodies studied here are unit square plate , l - shaped plate , cube , l - shaped volume and two rectangular plates meeting at various angles and creating an edge .",
    "besides being interesting and difficult , these solutions can have significant applications in micro electromechanical systems ( mems ) , nano - devices , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , electro - optical elements , micro - pattern gas detectors ( mpgd ) and many other disciplines in science and technology .",
    "for these problems , it is important to study integral features such as the capacitance of the conductors , as well as detailed features such as the charge density , potential and flux on various surfaces of these objects including regions close to the geometric singularities .",
    "while several approaches including finite - difference method ( fdm ) , finite element method ( fem ) , bem and its variants such as the surface charge method ( scm ) and various implementations of the monte - carlo technique ( often coupled with kelvin transformation ) have been used to study these problems , only the latter two approaches , namely , bem and monte - carlo technique are found to possess the precision necessary to model the curiously difficult electrostatics with acceptable levels of accuracy @xcite .",
    "the volume discretization methods are known to be unsuitable because of the open nature of the problem and the inadequate representation of edge and corner singularities .",
    "methods using kelvin inversion ( or quadratic inversion ) , although accurate , have been found incapable of handling planar problems . it may be noted here that despite the usefulness of 2d analysis , there are an overwhelming number of problems that need to be addressed in 3d . as a result , several interesting approaches have been developed to analyze edge and corner related problems in complete three dimensions , without even the assumption of axial symmetry . in order to maintain applicability in the most general scenarios , in this work",
    "we will deal with the problems of edge and corner as truly three - dimensional objects even when comparing the results with 2d analytic ones .",
    "the problem of estimation of capacitance of square plate and cube raised to unit volt has been studied by an especially large number of workers using entirely different approaches .",
    "in fact , these have been considered to be some of the major unsolved problems of electrostatics , of which a solution is said to have been given by dirichlet and subsequently lost .",
    "one of the more popular numerical approaches used to explore these problems is the bem / scm @xcite .",
    "some of the solution attempts are more than a century old and yielded quite acceptable results .",
    "the later studies @xcite , used the mesh refinement technique and extrapolation of @xmath0 ( the number of elements used to discretize a given body ) to infinity in order to arrive at more precise estimates of the capacitance . in order to carry out this extrapolation ,",
    "uniform charge density scenario has been maintained so that the form of charge distribution on individual segments becomes irrelevant .",
    "according to the @xcite , it is justified to use uniform charge density on individual elements because increase in complexity through the use of non - uniform charge density ultimately does not lead to computational advantage . in @xcite",
    ", the author mentions that for the cube , the element sizes are made such that the charge on each element remains approximately a constant ( independent of its distance from an edge ) since this arrangement is found to give the most accurate results .",
    "the problem of estimation of the order of singularities at edges and corners of different nature is strongly coupled with the problem of estimation of integral properties such as the capacitance of conductors of various shapes .",
    "thus , this problem , which also has importance in relation to other areas of science and technology as discussed earlier , has attracted the attention of a large number of workers as well . here ,",
    "fortunately , some analysis has been possible using purely theoretical tools @xcite , at least for two - dimensional cases . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors used a singular perturbation technique to obtain the singularity index at inside and outside corners of a sectorial conducting plate .",
    "similarly , corner singularity exponents were numerically obtained in @xcite . according to @xcite , it was possible to achieve accuracy of one in million through the use of fem approximations for both electrodes and surface charge density , in addition to proper handling of edge and corner singularities . in this investigation ,",
    "the fichera s theorem was used to correctly describe the peculiarities of surface charge density behaviour in the vicinity of the electrode ribs and tips .    according to another recent work @xcite , low - order polynomials used to represent the corners and edges",
    "lead to errors in estimation of the derivatives of the potential , and that is the crux of the problem . despite its advantages ( no prior knowledge of singular elements and the order of singularity is necessary ) and good convergence characteristics , the mesh refinement approach has been mentioned to be less accurate than two other methods , namely , 1 ) singular elements , and 2 ) singular functions . among these ,",
    "beforehand knowledge of the location and behaviour of the singularity in terms of the order of singularity is required for ( 1 ) . the singular function approach ( 2 )",
    "performs the best since it uses both the above and also information on singularity profile ( corresponding to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given geometry ) .",
    "unfortunately , this approach requires complex formulation and is generally restricted to 2d .",
    "since the singular element approach uses the location information and only the order of the singularity , it is more versatile and popular . thus , @xcite implements the method of singular elements in 3d while attempting to use proper shape function / interpolation function to model correct singular behaviour at corners and edges .",
    "it is shown that singular elements are needed to accurately capture the behavior at singular regions , such as sharp corners and edges , where standard elements fail to give an accurate result .",
    "unfortunately , singular elements must be defined before it is possible to apply either the singular function or the singular element approach .",
    "this is a nontrivial task since for a realistic device , there can easily be thousands , if not millions , of elements involved .",
    "according to @xcite , the manual classification of boundary elements based on their singularity conditions is an immensely laborious task if not outright impractical . in @xcite",
    ", the authors developed an algorithm to extract the regions where singularity arises by querying the geometric model for convex edges based on geometric information of the model .",
    "the associated nodes of the boundary elements on these edges were then retrieved and categorized according to different types of singularity configuration .",
    "the algorithm developed was implemented in the patran command language ( pcl ) on the msc / patran platform @xcite which is an industry standard finite - element pre- and post - processor allowing a high degree of customization . in order to determine the order of singularity ,",
    "two - dimensional results have been used directly @xcite for edges under the assumption that the point lies sufficiently far from any corner .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , any point other than the vertices has been considered to be far enough .",
    "this approach is quite unlikely to be very accurate , especially when the dimensions of the devices are small enough so that no point may even be considered to be far enough .",
    "later , while discussing the results obtained using our proposed approach , we will return to this issue again . a study on the effect of bias ratio (",
    "a ratio of the largest element length to the smallest element length , similar to r- mesh refinement ) has led the authors @xcite to state that while for normal elements this ratio should be around 4:1 for a given problem , the singular element approach works better with lower bias ratio .    besides the above procedures to identify the singular elements and their orders",
    ", attempts have also been made to place nodes at optimal positions while solving problems involving edges and corners .",
    "for example , in fracture mechanics @xcite , for handling singularities of the order 0.5 , mid - side nodes in quadratic elements is normally shifted to quarter point positions .",
    "several other techniques such as least square , constrained displacement of side nodes adjacent to a crack - tip @xcite have also been used to find the optimum position of the mid - side nodes for handling singularities of other orders . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have subsequently shown that this approach of shifting mid - side nodes is likely to produce singularities of order 0.5 only and it is not suitable to impose arbitrary singularity in isoparametric elements by simply shifting side nodes to assumed positions .",
    "in addition to bem approaches , work has also been carried out using radically different approaches , for example , the monte carlo methods .",
    "an impressive array of work exist providing very accurate estimates of capacitance and variation of charge density near edges and corners @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , the use of bem introduces unnatural estimate of the charge density distribution - not for shapes with smooth contours ( discs or spheres ) , but for plates and cubes .",
    "it has been mentioned that the situation is worst for the corner singularities of plates in which case there are no other surfaces present ( as in a cube ) to weaken the order of singularity at the corner .",
    "we will discuss this issue when results for square plates are presented below .",
    "the other point is that the bem can not satisfy the boundary conditions at or , at least , close to the edge because , the collocation points in bem does not match the boundary of the device .",
    "in fact , it is mentioned that the solutions become unstable when the collocation points are shifted away from the centroid of the elements . this notion , as mentioned in the earlier paragraph , is not without counter - examples . moreover , this is a point that we plan to take up in a future communication where we hope to illustrate that for the proposed formulation , shifting the collocation points to non - centroid locations does not lead to numerical instabilities .",
    "in addition , the approach of extrapolating capacitance has been criticized on the ground that they do not match for different amounts of shift .",
    "it has been mentioned that no formal error analysis exists for methods other than fdm and the extrapolation is purely empirical in nature .",
    "it has been observed that the apparent high accuracy may be illusory in nature and citing @xcite , it has been emphasized that situation can become even worse by attempting extrapolation of results obtained using non - equivalent meshes .    by developing a model that incorporates the truly distributed nature of sources / doublets / vortices on surfaces of three - dimensional geometries , we have recently shown @xcite that it is possible to use the same formulation for studying a very wide range of problems ( multi - scale , involving multiple layers of dielectric materials ) governed by the poisson s equation .",
    "recently , we have extended the new formulation with the capability of including triangular elements as an option for discretizing arbitrary three - dimensional bodies @xcite . here , we present the expressions to evaluate the exact values of potential and fluxes at any arbitrary point due to uniform singularity distributed on right - angled triangular element .",
    "these expressions have been included as additional functions of the isles library and subsequently used in the nebem solver in the manner usual to , probably , most of the bem solvers available . besides presenting the expressions , we have also shown results to illustrate the accuracy of the expressions under various circumstances .    in this report",
    ", we have presented studies on the electrostatic configuration of several three - dimensional bodies , all of which contain corners and / or edges .",
    "the classic benchmark problems of estimating the capacitance of a unit square plate and unit cube raised to unit volt have been addressed .",
    "electrostatics of generic shapes such as l - shaped plate and l - shaped 3d conductors has also been analyzed .",
    "in all the above cases , the order of the singularity distribution near the edges and corners has been estimated in addition to estimating the capacitance of the conductors themselves .",
    "the singularity distributions obtained have been compared with theoretical and numerical studies carried out by earlier workers .",
    "the variation of the singularity along an edge between two corners at its ends has been studied , probably for the first time .",
    "finally , the well - known problem of electrostatic configuration of two planes intersecting at different angles has been addressed .",
    "the two - dimensional counter - part of this problem is known to have analytic solution and has even been discussed in several textbooks on electromagnetics @xcite . although accessible analytically , this problem seems to have been rarely solved using numerical techniques @xcite .",
    "this benchmark problem is known to be a difficult one and , in order to test the proposed approach under difficult circumstances , we have computed electrostatic properties of a three - dimensional analogue of this problem close to the point of intersection for a very wide range of angle of intersection . following the above studies , we have come to the conclusion that the proposed approach is capable of solving critical multi - scale problems governed by the poisson s equation in a rather straight - forward manner . while higher bit accuracy , improved evaluation of transcendental functions , adaptive mesh generation and parallelization is expected to be of significant help , no special mathematical treatment or new formulation has been found to be necessary to deal with problems involving corners / edges and extremely closely spaced surfaces .    according to @xcite , using bem , it is difficult to obtain physically consistent results close to these geometric singularities .",
    "wild variations in the magnitude of the charge density have been observed with the change in the degree of discretization , the reason once again being associated with the nodal model of singularities . in contrast , using nebem , we have obtained very smooth variation close to corner .",
    "presence of oscillations seemingly acceptable to @xcite , has not occurred .",
    "in fact , oscillations close to edges and corners considered in this work seem to indicate numerical inaccuracy and have been treated accordingly .",
    "in addition to the shape , the magnitudes of the charge density have been found to be consistently converging to physically realistic values .",
    "these results clearly indicate that since the foundation expressions of the solver are exact , it is possible to find the potential and flux accurately in the complete physical domain , including the critical near - field domain using nebem .",
    "in addition , since the singularities are no longer assumed to be nodal and we have the exact expressions for potential and flux throughout the physical domain , the boundary conditions no longer need to be satisfied at _ special _ collocation points such as the centroid of an element .",
    "although consequences of this considerable advantage is still under study , it is expected that this feature will allow nebem to yield even more accurate estimates for problems involving corners and edges since it should be possible to generate an over - determined system of equations by placing extra collocation points near the edges / corners .",
    "this will also allow the method to satisfy the boundary conditions of a given geometry at its true boundaries .",
    "it should be noted here that the exact expressions for triangular elements consist of a significantly larger number of mathematical operations than those for rectangular elements presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , for any solver based on the isles library , it is more economical to use a mixed mesh of rectangular and triangular elements using rectangular elements as much as possible .",
    "in the following discussions , we will concentrate on the electrostatics of conducting geometries governed by the poisson s equation . using bem approach , the poisson s equation for electrostatic potential @xmath1",
    "can be solved to obtain the distribution of charges which leads to a given potential configuration . for a point charge @xmath2 at @xmath3 in 3d",
    "space , the potential @xmath4 at @xmath5 is known to be @xmath6 for a general charge distribution with charge density @xmath7 , superposition holds and results in @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the free space green s function for the laplace operator in 3d with @xmath10 , the permittivity of free space .",
    "similarly , the field for a general charge distribution can be written as @xmath11 leading to @xmath12 and , finally to , @xmath13 the charge distribution can be obtained from equation ( [ eq : potential ] ) or ( [ eq : field ] ) by satisfying the boundary conditions at collocation points known either in the form of potential ( dirichlet ) or flux ( neumann ) or a mixture of these two ( mixed / robin ) on material boundaries / surfaces present in the domain .    considering the dirichlet problem only at present ( for ease of discussion ) ,",
    "the following integral equation of the first kind can be set up .",
    "@xmath14 in the above equation , @xmath4 is the potential at a point @xmath15 in space and @xmath16 is the charge density at an infinitesimally small volume @xmath17 placed at @xmath18 .",
    "the problem is , generally , to find @xmath7 as a function of space resulting the known distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "once the charge distribution on the boundaries and all the surfaces is known , potential and field at any point in the computational domain can be obtained using the same equation ( [ eq : green ] ) and its derivative .",
    "the primary step of the bem technique is to discretize the boundaries and surfaces of a given problem .",
    "the elements resulting out of the discretization process are normally rectangular or triangular though elements of other shapes are also used .",
    "elements of triangular shape can be used to model geometries of any variety and , thus , is one of the most commonly used in many approaches of numerical simulation including fem and bem . in the collocation approach ,",
    "the next step is to find out charge distribution on the elements that satisfies equation ( [ eq : green ] ) following the given boundary conditions .",
    "the charge distribution is normally represented in terms of known basis functions with unknown coefficients .",
    "for example , in zero - th order formulations using constant basis function , which is also the most popular one among all the bem formulations because of a good optimization between accuracy and computational complexity , the charge distribution on each element is assumed to be uniform and equivalent to a point charge located at the centroid of the element .",
    "this is the method that is referred to as the _ usual bem _ in the rest of the paper .",
    "however , diverse varieties of basis function have been exercised to develop many more bem formulations in order to represent the charge distribution on an element more efficiently so as to enhance the accuracy of the method .",
    "since the potentials on the surface elements are known from the given potential configuration , equation ( [ eq : green ] ) can be used to generate algebraic expressions relating unknown charge densities and potentials at the centroid of the elements .",
    "one unique equation can be obtained for each centroid considering influences of all other elements including self influence and , thus , the same number of equations can be generated as there are unknowns . in matrix form , the resulting system of simultaneous linear algebraic set of equations can be written as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the matrix consisting of influences among the elements due to unit charge density on each of them , @xmath21 represents a column vector of unknown charge densities at centroids of the elements and @xmath22 represents known values of potentials at the centroids of these elements .",
    "each element of this influence coefficient or capacity coefficient matrix , @xmath20 is a direct evaluation of an equation similar to equations ( [ eq : potential ] ) or ( [ eq : field ] ) which represents the effect of a single element on a boundary / surface ( obtained through discretization ) on a point where a boundary condition of the given problem is known . while , in general , this should necessitate an integration of the green s function over the area of the element , this integration is avoided in most of the bem solvers through the assumption of nodal concentration of singularities with known basis function .",
    "the construction of the matrix implies that its diagonal elements are dominant through the presence of the coulomb - type singularity in the kernel .",
    "this singularity has been shown to make the solutions well - defined in the class of rather smooth functions @xcite .",
    "since the right hand side of ( [ eq : matrix ] ) is known , in principle , it is possible to solve the system of algebraic equations and obtain surface charge density on each of the element used to describe the conducting surfaces of the detector following @xmath23 once the charge density distribution is obtained , equations ( [ eq : potential ] ) and ( [ eq : field ] ) can be used to obtain both potential and field at any point in the computational domain .    despite the elegance of formulation ,",
    "the usual bem suffers from several drawbacks that have resulted in its relative lack of popularity .",
    "two of the most important ones can be mentioned as follows .",
    "( i ) it is assumed that a surface distribution of charge density on an element can be represented by a nodal arrangement based on a chosen basis function .",
    "( ii ) it is assumed that the satisfaction of the boundary condition at a predetermined point ( or , through the use of known shape functions ) is equivalent to satisfying the same on the whole element in a distributed manner .",
    "the former assumption leads to infamous numerical boundary layer @xcite due to which the near - field solution in regions close to an element becomes erroneous .",
    "thus the estimation of potential and field in near - field region close to the boundaries and surfaces by usual bem is found to be inaccurate .",
    "this also leads to complications in solving problems involving closely spaced surfaces such as degenerate surfaces , edges , corners and other geometrical singularities .",
    "the degenerate surface refers to a boundary , two portions of which approach each other such that the exterior region between the two portions becomes infinitely thin .",
    "it is well known that the coincidence of two boundaries gives rise to an ill - conditioned problem .",
    "a number of special formulations has been developed to cope up with these problems but , unfortunately , most of these formulations are effective in a rather small subset of problems related to potential and field that are usually faced in reality .    this problem has been resolved to a great extent through the development of the nebem solver that uses _ exact integration _ of the green s function and its derivative in its formulation .",
    "these integrations for rectangular and triangular elements having uniform charge density have been obtained as closed - form analytic expressions using symbolic mathematics @xcite .",
    "thus they account for truly distributed nature of charge density on a given element . besides the fundamental change in the way the influence coefficient matrix is computed and the foundation expressions used for evaluating potential and field at any point after the charge density vector is solved for , most of the other features of nebem are similar to any other bem solver .",
    "the expressions for potential and flux at a point @xmath24 in free space due to uniform source distributed on a rectangular flat surface having corners situated at @xmath25 and @xmath26 has been presented , validated and used in @xcite and , thus , is not being repeated here .    here ,",
    "we present the exact expressions necessary to compute the potential and flux due to a right - angled triangular element of arbitrary size , as shown in fig.[fig : trielemgeom ] .",
    "it may be noted here that the length in the x direction has been normalized , while that in the z direction has been allowed to be of any arbitrary magnitude , @xmath27 . from the figure ,",
    "it is easy to see that in order to find out the influence due to triangular element , we have imposed another restriction , namely , the necessity that the x and z axes coincide with the perpendicular sides of the right - angled triangle . both these restrictions are trivial and can be taken care of by carrying out suitable scaling and appropriate vector transformations .",
    "it may be noted here that closed - form expressions for the influence of rectangular and triangular elements having uniform singularity distributions have been previously presented in @xcite .",
    "however , in these works , the expressions presented are quite complicated and difficult to implement . in @xcite and in the present work ,",
    "the expressions we have presented are lengthy , but completely straight - forward . as a result ,",
    "the implementation issues of the present expressions , in terms of the development of the isles library and the nebem solver , are managed quite easily .     right - angled triangular element with x - length 1 and an arbitrary z - length , @xmath27 ; p is the point where the influence ( potential and flux ) is being computed , width=288,height=288 ]    it is easy to show that the influence ( potential ) at a point @xmath28 due to uniform source distributed on a right - angled triangular element as depicted in fig.[fig : trielemgeom ] can be represented as a multiple of @xmath29 in which we have assumed that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as shown in the geometry of the triangular element .",
    "the closed - form expression for the potential has been obtained using symbolic integration @xcite which was subsequently simplified through substantial effort .",
    "it is found to be significantly more complicated in comparison to the expression for rectangular elements presented in @xcite and can be written as @xmath34    where , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes a constant of integration .",
    "similarly , the flux components due to the above singularity distribution can also be represented through closed - form expressions as shown below :    @xmath45    @xmath46    and ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 implies the sign of the y - coordinate and @xmath44 indicates constants of integrations .",
    "it is to be noted that the constants of different integrations are not the same .",
    "in addition to being extremely useful in the mathematical modeling of physical processes governed by the inverse square laws , these expression are expected to be useful as benchmark expressions for other approximate formulations .",
    "being exact and valid throughout the physical domain , they can be used to formulate versatile solvers to solve multi - scale multi - physics problems governed by the laplace / poisson equations involving dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions .",
    "the expressions for the rectangular element have been validated in detail in @xcite . here , we present the results for triangular elements in fair detail . in fig.[fig :",
    "cntrtrielem ] , we have presented a comparison of potentials evaluated for a unit triangular element by using the exact expressions , as well as by using numerical quadrature of high accuracy .",
    "the two results are found to compare very well throughout .",
    "please note that contours have been obtained on the plane of the element , and thus , represents a rather critical situation .",
    "similarly , fig.[fig : tridiag1fy ] shows a comparison between the results obtained using closed - form expressions for flux and those obtained using numerical quadrature .",
    "the flux considered here is in the @xmath49 direction and is along a line beginning from @xmath50 and ending at @xmath51 .",
    "the comparison shows the commendable accuracy expected from closed form expressions . in figs.[fig : surftrielem ] and [ fig : trify_xy0 ] , the surface plots of potential on the element plane ( @xmath52 plane ) and @xmath49-flux on the @xmath53 plane have been presented from which the expected significant increase in potential and sharp change in the flux value on the element is observed .",
    "thus , by using a small fraction of computational resources in comparison to those consumed in numerical quadratures , isles can compute the exact value of potential and flux for singularities distributed on triangular elements .",
    "potential contours on a triangular element computed using exact expressions and by numerical quadrature , width=384,height=384 ]     comparison of flux ( in the y direction ) as computed by isles and numerical quadrature along a diagonal line , width=480,height=288 ]      in order to emphasize the accuracy of isles , we have considered the following severe situations in the near - field region in which it is observed that the quadratures can match the accuracy of isles only when a high degree of discretization is used .",
    "please note that in these cases , the value of @xmath27 has been considered to be 10 . in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvspot ] we have presented the variation of potential along a line on the element surface running parallel to the z - axis of the triangular element ( see fig.[fig : trielemgeom ] ) and going through the centroid of the element .",
    "it is observed that results obtained using even a @xmath54 quadrature is quite unacceptable .",
    "in fact , by zooming on to the image , it can be found that only the maximum discretization yields results that match closely to the exact solution .",
    "it may be noted here that the potential is a relatively easier property to compute .",
    "the difficulty of achieving accurate flux estimates is illustrated in the two following figures .",
    "the variation of flux in the @xmath55-direction along the same line as used in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvspot ] has been presented in fig.[fig : tcentroidzvsfx ] .",
    "similarly , variation of @xmath49-flux along a diagonal line ( beginning at ( -10,-10,-10 ) and ending at ( 10,10,10 ) and piercing the element at the centroid ) has been presented in fig.[fig : tdiag1vsfy ] . from these figures",
    "we see that the flux values obtained using the quadrature are always inaccurate even if the discretization is as high as @xmath54 .",
    "we also observe that the estimates are locally inaccurate despite the use of very high amount of discretization ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) .",
    "specifically , in the latter figure , even the highest discretization can not match the exact values at the peak , while in the former only the highest one can correctly emulate the sharp change in the flux value .",

    "the optimized amount of discretization to be used for the quadrature can be determined from a study of the speed of execution of each of the functions in the library and has been presented separately in a following sub - section .",
    "if we plan to replace the exact expressions by quadratures ( in order to reduce the computational expenses , presumably ) beyond a certain given distance , the quadrature should necessarily be efficient enough to justify the replacement . while standard but more elaborate algorithms similar to the fast multipole method ( fmm ) @xcite along with the gmres @xcite matrix solver can lead to further of computational efficiency , the simple approach as outlined above can help in reducing a fair amount of computational effort .",
    "in the following , we present the results of numerical experiments that help us in determining the far - field performance of the exact expressions and quadratures of various degrees that , in turn , help us in choosing the more efficient approach for a desired level of accuracy .    in fig.[fig :",
    "diagpffarfield ] we have presented potential values obtained using the exact approach , @xmath54 , @xmath58 and no discretization , i.e. , the usual bem approximation while using the zeroth order piecewise uniform charge density assumption . the potentials are computed along a diagonal line running from ( -1000 , -1000 , -1000 ) to ( 1000 , 1000 , 1000 ) which pierces a triangular element of @xmath59 .",
    "it can be seen that results obtained using the usual bem approach yields inaccurate results as we move closer than distances of 10 units , while the @xmath58 discretization yields acceptable results up to a distance of 1.0 unit . in order to visualize the errors incurred due to the use of quadratures , we have plotted fig.[fig : errorpot ] where",
    "the errors incurred ( normalized with respect to the exact value ) have been plotted . from this figure",
    "we can conclude that for the given diagonal line , the error due to the usual bem approximation falls below 1% if the distance is larger than 20 units while for the simple @xmath58 discretization , it is 2 units .",
    "it may be mentioned here that along the axes the error turns out to be significantly more @xcite and the limits need to be effectively doubled to achieve the accuracy for all cases possible .",
    "thus , for achieving 1% accuracy , the usual bem is satisfactory only if the distance of the influenced point is five times the longer side of an element .",
    "please note here that the error drops to 1 out of @xmath60 as the distance becomes fifty times the longer side .",
    "besides proving that the exact expressions work equally well in the near - field as well as the far - field , this fact justifies the usual bem approach for much of the computational domain leading to substantial savings in computational expenses .",

    "the expression given is exact , whereas , the multipole ( monopole+quadrupole ) expression is expected to be valid at any arbitrary location .",
    "the accuracy depends on the distance from the element as discussed in the papers , an approximate rule being that the accuracy is of the order of @xmath61 when the distance of the field point from the barycenter of the triangle is more than @xmath62 times the longer side of the right triangle . for points less distant than the mentioned value",
    ", the triangle needs to be further segmented .",
    "consulting fig .",
    "[ fig : errorpot ] we may note that along a diagonally intersecting line , the usual bem achieves this accuracy only when the distance of a field point is 8 times the larger side .",
    "the @xmath58 discretization is as good for a field point that is distant twice the longer side .    in table",

    "it is interesting to note that the right triangle for which two perpendicular sides are of equal length , it is most difficult to obtain the precise value of potential using quadrature .",
    "in fact , with a discretization of @xmath63 , we obtained the value of 2.407462 , while with @xmath64 we obtained 2.407323 .

    "an efficient and robust library , isles , for solving potential problems in a large variety of science and engineering problems has been presented .",
    "exact closed - form expressions used to develop isles have been validated throughout the physical domain ( including the critical near - field region ) by comparing these results with results obtained using numerical quadrature of high accuracy and with those obtained using quadrupole expressions .",
    "algorithmic aspects of this development have also been touched upon .",
    "the nebem solver that uses foundation expressions being evaluated by isles , has been used to solve several corner and edge electrostatic problems .",
    "several classic benchmark problems such as those related to unit square plate and unit cube have been solved to very high precision .",
    "charge density values at critical geometric locations like corners have been found to be numerically stable and physically acceptable .",
    "values of singularity indices at different corners and edges have been estimated and compared with other analytic and numerical estimates .",
    "the agreement among the different approaches has been found to be quite acceptable .",
    "it has been observed that the variation of this index along the edge of a conducting body is non - negligible implying caution necessary for methods that need prior knowledge of these indices to solve a given problem . finally ,",
    "using the same solver , a three - dimensional equivalent of an edge problem has been solved for which analytic solution exists in two - dimensions .",
