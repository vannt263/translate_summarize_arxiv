    "let @xmath0 denote a sample of independent @xmath1 dimensional random variables from a distribution @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 the spatial sign , then @xmath7 denotes the empirical spatial sign covariance matrix ( sscm ) with location @xmath8 .",
    "the canonical choice for the location estimator @xmath8 is the spatial median @xmath9 beside its nice robustness properties like an asymptotic breakdown - point of 1/2 , it has ( under regularity conditions , see @xcite ) the advantageous feature that it centres the spatial signs , i.e. , @xmath10 so that @xmath11 is indeed the empirical covariance matrix of the spatial signs of the data . if @xmath8 is ( strongly ) consistent for a location @xmath12 , it was shown in @xcite that under mild conditions on @xmath2 the empirical sscm is a ( strongly ) consistent estimator for its population counterpart @xmath13 there are some nice results if @xmath2 is within the class of continuous elliptical distributions , which means that @xmath2 possesses a density of the form @xmath14 for a location @xmath15 , a symmetric and positive definite shape matrix @xmath16 and a function @xmath17 , which is often called the elliptical generator .",
    "prominent members of the elliptical family are the multivariate normal distribution and elliptical @xmath18-distributions ( e.g.  @xcite , p.  208 ) .",
    "if second moments exists , then @xmath19 is the expectation of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 a multiple of the covariance matrix .",
    "the shape matrix @xmath21 is unique only up to a multiplicative constant . in the following ,",
    "we consider the trace - normalized shape matrix @xmath22 which is convenient since @xmath23 also has trace 1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is elliptical , then @xmath23 and @xmath21 share the same eigenvectors and the respective eigenvalues have the same ordering .",
    "for this reason , the sscm has been proposed for robust principal component analysis ( e.g.   @xcite ) . in the present article",
    ", we study the eigenvalues of the sscm .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath26 those of @xmath23 .",
    "explicit formulae that relate the @xmath27 to the @xmath28 are only known for @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) , namely @xmath30 assuming @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 thus the eigenvalues of the sscm are closer together than those of the corresponding shape matrix .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this holds true for arbitrary @xmath33 , so @xmath34 as long as @xmath35 there is no explicit map between the eigenvalues known for @xmath33 .",
    "drre et al .",
    "@xcite give a representation of @xmath27 as one - dimensional integral , which permits fast and accurate numerical evaluations for arbitrary @xmath1 , @xmath36 we use this formula ( implemented in r @xcite in the package sscor @xcite ) to get an impression how the eigenvalues of @xmath23 look like in comparison to those of @xmath25 .",
    "we first look at of equidistantly spaced eigenvalues @xmath37 for different @xmath38 .",
    "the magnitude of the eigenvalues necessarily decreases as @xmath1 increases , since @xmath39 per definition of @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "as one can see in figure [ eval ] , the eigenvalues of @xmath23 and @xmath25 approach each other for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "in fact the maximal absolute difference for @xmath40 is roughly @xmath41 . in the second scenario",
    ", we take @xmath42 equidistantly spaced eigenvalues and one eigenvalue 5 times larger than the rest , i.e. , @xmath43 \\frac{5(p-1)}{p((p+1)/{2}+5)-5}&i = p . \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this models the case where the dependence is mainly driven by one principle component .    as one can see in figure [ eval2 ] , the distance between the two largest eigenvalues is smaller for @xmath23 than for @xmath25 .",
    "this is not surprising in light of ( [ evrel ] ) .",
    "thus in general , the eigenvalues of the sscm are less separated than those of @xmath25 , which is one reason why the use of the sscm for robust principal component analysis has been questioned ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". however , the differences appear to be generally small in higher dimensions .",
    "equation ( [ eveq ] ) can be used to derive an estimator for the correlation coefficient based on the empirical sscm : the spatial sign correlation coefficient @xmath44 ( @xcite ) . under mild regularity assumptions",
    "this estimator is consistent under elliptical distributions and asymptotically normal with variance @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ratio of the marginal scales and @xmath47 is the generalized correlation coefficient , which coincides with the usual moment correlation coefficient if second moments exists .",
    "equation ( [ asi1 ] ) indicates that the variance of @xmath44 is minimal for @xmath48 , but can get arbitrarily large if @xmath49 tends to infinity or 0 .",
    "therefore a two - step procedure has been proposed , the _ two - stage spatial sign correlation _",
    "@xmath50 , which first normalizes the data by a robust scale estimator , e.g. , the median absolute deviation ( mad ) , and then computes the spatial sign correlation of the transformed data . under mild conditions ( see @xcite ) , this two - step procedure yields an asymptotic variance of @xmath51 which equals that of @xmath44 for the favourable case of @xmath48 .",
    "since ( [ asi2 ] ) only depends on the parameter @xmath52 , the two - stage spatial sign correlation coefficient is very suitable to construct robust and non - parametric confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient under ellipticity .",
    "it turns out that these intervals are quite accurate even for rather small sample sizes of @xmath53 and in fact more accurate then those based on the sample moment correlation coefficient @xcite .",
    "one can construct an estimator of the correlation matrix @xmath54 by filling the off - diagonal positions of the matrix estimate with the bivariate spatial sign correlation coefficients of all pairs of variables .",
    "this was proposed in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ evequation ] ) allows an alternative approach : first standardize the data by a robust scale estimator and compute the sscm of the transformed data .",
    "then apply a singular value decomposition @xmath55 where @xmath56 contains the ordered eigenvalues @xmath57 one obtains estimates @xmath58 by inverting ( [ evequation ] ) .",
    "although theoretical results are yet to be established , we found in our simulations that the following fix point algorithm @xmath59 works reliably and converges fast .",
    "let @xmath60 denote the diagonal matrix containing @xmath61 then @xmath62 is a suitable estimator for for the shape of the standardized data and @xmath63 with @xmath64 an estimator for the correlation matrix , which we call the _ multivariate spatial sign correlation matrix_. contrary to the pairwise approach , the multivariate spatial sign correlation matrix is positive semi - definite by construction .",
    "theoretical properties of the new estimator are not straightforward to establish . by a small simulation study we want to get an impression of its efficiency .",
    "we compare the variances of the moment correlation , the pairwise as well as the multivariate spatial sign correlation under several elliptical distributions : normal , laplace and @xmath18 distributions with 5 and 10 degrees of freedom .",
    "the latter three generate heavier tails than the normal distribution .",
    "the laplace distribution is obtained by the elliptical generator @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the appropriate integration constant depending on @xmath1 ( e.g.  @xcite , p.  209 ) .",
    "we take the identity matrix as shape matrix and compare the variances of an off - diagonal element of the matrix estimates for different dimensions @xmath67 and sample sizes @xmath68 .",
    "we use the r packages mvtnorm @xcite and mnm @xcite for the data generation .",
    "the results based on 10000 runs are summarized in table [ effit ] .",
    ".simulated variances ( multiplied by @xmath69 ) of one off - diagonal element of the correlation matrix estimate based on the moment correlation ( cor ) , the pairwise spatial sign correlation ( sscor pairwise ) and the multivariate spatial sign correlation matrix ( sscor multivariate ) for spherical normal ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and laplace ( @xmath73 ) distribution , several dimensions @xmath1 and sample sizes @xmath74.[effit ] [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     except for the moment correlation at the @xmath71 distribution , the results for @xmath75 and @xmath76 are very similar .",
    "note that the variance of the moment correlation decreases at the laplace distribution as the dimension @xmath1 increases , but not so for the other distributions considered .",
    "the lower dimensional marginals of the laplace distribution are , contrary to the normal and the @xmath18-distributions , not laplace distributed ( see @xcite ) , and the kurtosis of the one - dimensional marginals of the laplace distribution in fact decreases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "equation ( [ asi2 ] ) yields an asymptotic variance of 2 for the pairwise spatial sign correlation matrix elements regardless of the specific elliptical generator , which can also be observed in the simulation results .",
    "the moment correlation is twice as efficient under normality , but has a higher variance at heavy tailed distributions . for uncorrelated",
    "@xmath71 distributed random variables , the spatial sign correlation outperforms the moment correlation . looking at the multivariate spatial sign correlation , we see a strong increase of efficiency for larger @xmath1 . for @xmath77",
    "the variance is comparable to that of the moment correlation .",
    "since the asymptotic variance of the sscm does not depend on the elliptical generator , this is expected to also hold for the multivariate spatial sign correlation , and we find this confirmed by the simulations .",
    "the multivariate spatial sign correlation is more efficient than the moment correlation even under slightly heavier tails for moderately large @xmath1 .",
    "an increase of efficiency for larger @xmath1 is not uncommon for robust scatter estimators . it can be observed amongst others for @xmath78-estimators , the tyler shape matrix , the mcd , and @xmath79-estimators ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all of these are affine equivariant estimators , requiring @xmath80 .",
    "this is not necessary for the spatial sign correlation matrix .",
    "one may expect that the efficiency gain for large @xmath1 is at the expense of robustness , in particular a larger maximum bias curve .",
    "further research will be necessary to thoroughly explore the robustness properties and efficiency of the multivariate spatial sign correlation estimator .",
