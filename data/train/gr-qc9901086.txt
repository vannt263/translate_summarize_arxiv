    "this is one in a series of papers that develops perturbative mathematical and physical tools for studying the interaction of an isolated gravitating body with a complicated `` external universe '' in the slow - motion limit . by `` slow - motion limit '' we mean that the shortest timescale @xmath0 for changes of the body s multipole moments and/or changes of the universe s tidal gravitational field is long compared to the body s size @xmath1 : @xmath2 , where we have set the speed of light equal to unity .",
    "in addition to this slow - motion requirement , we also require that the body be isolated from other objects in the external universe , in the sense that both the radius of curvature @xmath3 of the external universe in the body s vicinity , and the lengthscale @xmath4 on which the universe s curvature changes there , are long compared to the body s size : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    the slow - motion , isolated - body formalism , to which this paper is a technical addendum , is , in essence , a perturbative expansion in powers of the small parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a detailed discussion of the structure of this expansion and its realm of validity ,",

    "i.b ) , the slow - motion and isolated - body assumptions make no reference to the internal gravity of the object under study .",
    "consequently , the thorne - hartle formalism in general , and the results of this paper in particular , can be applied even to strongly - gravitating bodies , as long as the source of the external tidal field is far enough away to allow a  buffer zone \" where gravity is weak .",
    "this buffer zone , called the local asymptotic rest frame , will be described more fully at the beginning of sec .",
    "two examples of isolated , slow - motion bodies are : ( i ) a neutron star or black hole in a compact binary system that spirals inward due to emission of gravitational waves ; and ( ii ) the satellite io , which travels around jupiter in an elliptic orbit and gets heated by jupiter s tidal gravitational field @xcite .",

    "thorne and hartle @xcite : formulated the problem of analyzing the effects of the external universe s tidal fields on such an isolated body , and conceived and initiated the development of the perturbative formalism for studying the influence of the tidal fields on the body s motion through the external universe , the precession of its spin axis , and its changes of mass - energy .",

    "their studies were motivated by numerical solutions of einstein s equations by wilson , mathews , and maronetti @xcite which seemed to show each neutron star in a binary being compressed to the point of collapse by gravitational interaction with its companion .",
    "thorne and flanagan found no such effect of the large magnitude seen in the numerical solutions . an important piece of thorne s analysis came from examining the work done on each star by its companion s tidal field ",
    ", an analysis of `` tidal heating . ''    thorne s analysis of tidal heating required dealing with an issue that thorne and hartle had discussed , but avoided confronting : for an isolated body with mass quadrupole moment @xmath10 , being squeezed by an external tidal gravitational field @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the external riemann tensor ) , there appears to be an ambiguity in the body s total mass - energy @xmath13 of order @xmath14 .",

    "because the coordinates are cartesian , it makes no difference whether tensor indices are placed up or down . )",
    "one can understand this apparent ambiguity by examining the time - time part of the spacetime metric in the body s local asymptotic rest frame : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the unit radial vector and @xmath17 is distance from the body in its local asymptotic rest frame . among the terms omitted here are those of quadratic and higher order in the body s mass @xmath13 and quadrupole moment @xmath18 and the external tidal field @xmath19terms induced by nonlinearities of the einstein field equations . among these nonlinear terms",

    " tidal heating \" of the isolated body involves injecting into it an amount of energy that is of just the same magnitude as this ambiguity , @xmath25 .",
    "does this mean that tidal heating is an ill - defined , unphysical concept ?",
    "certainly not , as is attested by photographs of volcanic plumes ejected from jupiter s satellite io ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) . that volcanism was predicted by peale , cassen , and reynolds @xcite before the voyager spacecraft discovered it ; and their explanation  that io gets tidally heated to high internal temperature by the coupling of its quadrupole moment to jupiter s tidal field ",
    "is firm ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the phrase  tidal heating \" to mean the net work done by an external tidal field on an isolated body .",
    "this phrase is slightly misleading , as the work done on the body need not necessarily go only into heat .",
    "the additional energy might be used to deform the body ( i.e. , raise a tide on it ) or it might go into vibrational energy .",
    "if , however , timescales for changes of @xmath19 and @xmath10 are not close to the body s vibrational periods , then , when averaged over many cycles of change of @xmath19 and/or @xmath10 , the work will contribute primarily to heat , as in the case of io .    in his analysis of binary neutron star systems ,",
    "thorne @xcite argued , but did not prove in detail , that although the tidal - quadrupole interaction energy is ambiguous , the amount of work done on an isolated body by an external tidal field ( i.e. , the amount of tidal heating ) is unambiguously given by the formula ) is only the leading order term in the perturbative expansion of @xmath26 .",
    "the next term is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the `` magnetic type '' tidal field of the external universe and @xmath29 is the body s current quadrupole moment @xcite . in this paper",

    "in sec.iii we shall give a relativistic demonstration  showing , more specifically , that although the quadrupole / tidal interaction energy is gauge dependent , the work done is gauge invariant and has the value ( [ eq : work ] ) .",
    "in this section , we consider a newtonian body , with weak internal gravity @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the body s gravitational potential ) , subjected to an external newtonian tidal field .",
    "we assume that the external field is nearly homogeneous in the vicinity of the body , @xmath33 ( cf .",
    "; in the newtonian case , the inner boundary of the vacuum  local asymptotic rest frame \" indicated by the inner dashed circle  would be at the surface of the body ) .    in our analysis",

    ", the region where the external field is nearly homogeneous ( again , cf .",
    "1 ) . we denote by @xmath34 the interior of this sphere and by @xmath35 its boundary . of greatest interest",
    "will be the interaction energy ( between the body and the external tidal field ) and the work done by the tidal field on the body .",

    "for simplicity , assume that all the bodies are made of perfect fluid ( a restriction that can easily be abandoned ) .",
    "then , for the full system , the newtonian gravitational energy density and energy flux can be written as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the newtonian gravitational potential , mass density , pressure , velocity , and specific internal energy @xcite .    using conservation of rest mass @xmath39 , the first law of thermodynamics @xmath40 , the euler equation for fluids @xmath41 , newton s field equation @xmath42 , and the definition of the comoving time derivative @xmath43",

    "choosing @xmath57 , by contrast , puts the gravitational energy entirely in the matter ( @xmath58 ) , so it vanishes outside the body . when @xmath58 is integrated over the entire system ( body plus its companions ) , the result is a widely used way of computing gravitational energy ( e.g. , sec .",

    "the energy in the region @xmath34 that contains and surrounds the body but excludes the companion , @xmath59 will depend on @xmath53 ; i.e. , it will depend on where the energy is localized .",
    "by contrast , the total energy ( [ eq : ntotalenergy ] ) for the fully isolated system ( body plus its companions ) will be independent of @xmath53 .    another way to express this ambiguity of the localization of the gravitational energy",
    "is given by thorne ( appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : it is possible to add the divergence of @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is an arbitrary constant ) to @xmath62 and the time derivative of @xmath63 to @xmath64 without affecting energy conservation ( [ eq : divtheta ] ) or the physics of the system .",

    ", the newtonian gravitational potential can be broken into two parts : the body s self field @xmath32 and the tidal field @xmath67 produced by the external universe ( the companion bodies ) , so that @xmath68 the external field is quadrupolar and source - free in the region @xmath66 so that @xmath69 and , furthermore , the tidal field @xmath70 evolves slowly with time .",
    "the body s ( external ) self field is monopolar and quadrupolar and has the body s mass distribution as a source : @xmath71 the quadrupole moment @xmath72 , like that of the external field , evolves slowly with time , but the body s mass @xmath13 is constant . recall that @xmath73 is radial distance from the body s center of mass and @xmath74 is the radial vector .",

    "the formalism to be used is the landau - lifshitz energy - momentum pseudotensor and multipole expansions as developed by thorne and hartle @xcite and zhang @xcite , together with the slow - motion approximation , so time derivatives are small compared to spatial gradients .",
    "we will work in the body s vacuum local asymptotic rest frame , which is defined as a region outside the body and far enough from it that its gravitational field can be regarded as a weak perturbation of flat spacetime , yet near enough that the tidal field of the external universe can be regarded as nearly homogeneous .",
    "this region is a spherical shell around the body ; its inner boundary is near the body s surface but far enough away for gravity to be weak , and its outer boundary is at a distance where the external tidal field begins to depart from homogeneity ( see fig .",
