    "it has been known for quite a long time that superconductivity ( s ) and ferromagnetism ( f ) are two antagonistic orderings and that they can hardly coexist in a same compound .",
    "although they tend to avoid each other , their mutual interaction may be studied when they are spatially separated , which is realized in superconductor / ferromagnet ( s / f ) hybrid structures ( as a review , see @xcite ) . indeed , in such systems , superconductivity and ferromagnetism",
    "can influence each other through the so called proximity effect. the main peculiarity of the proximity effect in s / f structures is the damping oscillatory behavior of the superconducting correlations in the f layers ( while they monotonically decay in normal layers of superconductor / normal metal structures ) . in the dirty limit and for large exchange field , the characteristic lengths of the decay and oscillations are the same .",
    "they are given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient in the ferromagnet and @xmath2 is the exchange field acting on the electrons spins .",
    "this unusual proximity effect leads to several striking phenomena , such as the non - monotonic dependence of the critical temperature and current of s / f multilayers on the f layers thickness and the realization of the so - called @xmath3 junction in s / f / s trilayers @xcite .    although the existing theory provides rather good qualitative description of the observed _ _  _ _ effects , there is still no complete quantitative agreement with experiments .",
    "this indicates that besides the exchange field , some additional pair - breaking mechanisms are present in the f layers .",
    "indeed , spin - flip process is inherent to the ferromagnetic layers ( because of magnetic impurities , spin - wave or non stoichiometric lattices ) and may have dramatic consequences on superconductivity ( contrary to non magnetic impurities that have very little impact ) .",
    "such a pair - breaking mechanism also arises in usually used weak ferromagnetic alloys , because they are close to ferromagnetism disappearance and then quite favorable to large magnetic disorder .",
    "this can be inferred for instance from the very strong decrease of the critical current of s / f / s junctions as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer in experimental studies ryazanov2001,sellier , ryazanov1 . in such experiments ,",
    "the ferromagnetic alloys used were cu@xmath4ni@xmath5 with @xmath6 , limit range of concentration for ferromagnetic properties .",
    "in addition , the pair destruction due to spin - orbit interaction must be taken into account as well .",
    "though the spin - flip and spin - orbit interactions in the ferromagnetic material were introduced in several recent theoretical studies on proximity effect in s / f hybrids , only few simple limiting cases were considered ( we ll give appropriate references below ) .",
    "thus the problem of quantitative description of these effects in s / f multilayered systems is still unsolved . in this paper",
    "we present the results of detailed theoretical study of the influence of spin - flip and spin - orbit scattering mechanisms on the critical temperature ( @xmath7 ) and critical current ( @xmath8 ) of s / f multilayered systems .",
    "we obtain analytical and numerical solutions of the problem which provide the basis not only for qualitative understanding of experimental results but also to fit the data quantitatively .",
    "in particular , we show that spin - orbit and spin - flip scattering mechanisms influence differently the properties of s / f structures : spin - orbit mechanism can destroy the @xmath7 and @xmath8 oscillations while spin - flip scattering can only modify them .",
    "we also report on a striking non - intuitive behavior that the critical temperature and current can acquire with the variation of the s / f interface transparency__. _ _",
    "a very convenient set of equations for an inhomogeneous superconductor was elaborated by eilenberger @xcite .",
    "however , the eilenberger equations can be replaced by the much simpler usadel equations @xcite when the electron scattering free path in s / f systems is shorter than the superconducting length , which is often the case .",
    "these equations are nonlinear but can be simplified when the temperature is close to the critical temperature @xmath9 or at any temperature in the f layer when the transparency is low .",
    "we consider a s / f multilayered system where all physical quantities depend only on the coordinate @xmath10 perpendicular to the layers .",
    "the natural choice of the spin - quantization axis is along the direction of the exchange field . in the general case , magnetic and spin - orbit scatterings mix up the up and down spin states .",
    "therefore , two anomalous green functions , namely @xmath11 and @xmath12 are needed to describe this situation .",
    "the linearized usadel equations may be written for @xmath13 as @xcite @xmath14 in the s layers and @xmath15 in the f layers , where @xmath16 is the superconducting order parameter , @xmath2 is the exchange field , @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient in the s(f ) layer and @xmath18 are the matsubara frequencies , @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is the spin - orbit scattering time .",
    "the magnetic scattering times are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the rate @xmath23 is proportional to the square of the exchange interaction potential ( the notations are the same as in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the microscopical green functions theory of superconductors with magnetic impurities and spin - orbit scattering was proposed by abrikosov and gorkov @xcite .",
    "besides , the usually used ferromagnets present a strong uniaxial anisotropy . in that case",
    ", the perpendicular fluctuations of the exchange field are suppressed , that is @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , henceforth , @xmath25 will be noted as the magnetic scattering time @xmath26 .",
    "the spin - flip scattering is now simply incorporated replacing @xmath27 by @xmath28 in the standard usadel equation , and @xmath26 is the magnetic scattering time ( see for example @xcite ) . note that the usadel equations in the f layers are not coupled anymore when @xmath29 , and only one equation is needed .",
    "the common feature of all the s / f bilayered and multilayered heterostructures is the non monotonic evolution of the critical temperature @xmath7 with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "this behavior was first predicted by buzdin and kuprianov _ _  _ _ @xcite and _ _  _ _ radovic _ _  et al . _ _",
    "@xcite , and was since then intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally ( as a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of magnetic scattering can result in an additional decrease of the transition temperature ( on the contrary , nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the transition temperature ) . note that the theoretical description of @xmath7 for ferromagnetic layers with spin - orbit scattering was performed by demler _",

    "1 ( this system is also equivalent to a s / f bilayer of thicknesses @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively ) .",

    "the ratio of the characteristic lengths _ _  _ _ @xmath81 clearly shows that the magnetic scattering decreases the decay length and increases the oscillation period . if @xmath82 , @xmath65 can become much smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "besides , the decrease of @xmath65 makes the observation of the oscillations more difficult .    the evolution of the critical temperature without and with spin - flip scattering is given in fig .",
    "the phase that really occurs is the one with higher critical temperature .",
    "it is seen that @xmath65 decreases in presence of spin - flip while @xmath66 increases .",

    "we extend this discussion taking into account spin - flip scattering in the f - layer and considering broader range of interfacetransparencies and demonstrate that new effects take place in this situation .",
    "the intriguing evolution of @xmath85 with the interface transparency parameter @xmath86 must be underlined ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . if @xmath87 , there is no magnetic scattering and it could intuitively be believed that , the higher the barrier , the less is the influence of the proximity effect on the s layer and therefore , @xmath88 .",
    "however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 that the critical temperature is a decreasing function of the interface transparency parameter @xmath86 for a small thickness of the f layer .",
    "this counter - intuitive behavior can be qualitatively understood for a s / f bilayer .",
    "the probability for a cooper pair to leave the s layer is smaller for a low transparent interface @xmath89 .",
    "nevertheless , the probability for this pair to come back again in the s layer is much higher for a transparent interface . indeed ,",
    "when the f layer is thin enough , the reflection of the cooper pair at the other interface of the f layer allows the pair to cross again the first interface , which is easier when @xmath86 is small .",
    "consequently , the staying time in the f layer increases with the increase of the barrier , and when this time becomes higher than the coherence time of the cooper pair , the pair is destroyed , leading to a weakened superconductivity . therefore , the critical temperature decreases with the barrier in that case . on the other hand , if @xmath90 increases , the cooper pair is hardly reflected by the external interface of the f layer whatever the value of @xmath86 is and the critical temperature is expected to increase with the barrier .",
    "besides , an analytical approach using formula ( [ tau ] ) leads to the determination of the critical temperature when @xmath91 . in that case , the pair breaking parameter in the 0 phase becomes @xmath92 two behaviors emerge whether @xmath93 or not . indeed , if @xmath94 , the critical temperature evolution is described by @xmath95 which is an increasing function of @xmath96 . on the contrary , if @xmath97 , the critical temperature decreases when @xmath96 increases , following @xmath98 the critical temperature evolution with @xmath96 presented in fig .",
    "3 is therefore understood .    in presence of small magnetic scattering ,",
    "the critical temperature evolution remains qualitatively the same .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , it appears that superconductivity may be less destroyed when there is spin - flip scattering . in that case , the pair breaking parameter becomes @xmath99 the critical temperature is described by @xmath100 when @xmath101 , and magnetic scattering leads to a slight enhancement of the transition temperature . on the contrary , if @xmath102 @xmath103 and spin - flip implies the decrease of the transition temperature .",
    "let us now consider briefly the general case , with spin - orbit and/or perpendicular spin - flip scattering .",
    "an additional parameter has to be introduced , namely @xmath104 and the parameter @xmath105 now becomes @xmath106 in that case , expressions ( [ tau-0 ] ) and([tau pi ] ) are modified . in the 0 phase ,",

    "however , a special situation arises when @xmath115 .",
    "then , the oscillations of the cooper pair wave function are completely destroyed .",
    "similar conclusion for spin - orbit mechanism was obtained in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the influence of the perpendicular magnetic scattering is analogous to the spin - orbit scattering ( see fig .",
