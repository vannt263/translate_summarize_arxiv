    "in view of the compelling experimental evidence on neutrino oscillations , the origin of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing emerges as one of the most fundamental issues in particle physics .",
    "since neutrinos are massless particles in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , a broad class of models extended the sm have been proposed in order to accommodate massive neutrinos .",
    "the seesaw mechanism  @xcite turns out to be among the most attractive extensions of the sm in virtue of its natural explanation of tiny neutrino masses . in the canonical type - i",
    "seesaw model , three heavy right - handed neutrinos are introduced besides the sm particle contents , while a majorana mass term @xmath2 is assumed , which is not subjected to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking scale , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the light neutrino mass scale is then strongly suppressed with respect to @xmath4 due to the heavy right - handed neutrino masses .",
    "in general , the type - i seesaw model is pestered with too many model parameters , and therefore , fails to predict the lepton flavor mixing pattern as well as the light neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "for example , in case of the simplest type - i seesaw model with three right - handed neutrinos , there are in total fifteen free parameters in the dirac mass matrix together with three unknown mass eigenvalues of heavy majorana neutrinos , whereas the light neutrino mass matrix contains only nine physical parameters , indicating a lack of valuable predictions .",
    "note that , in the most economical type - i seesaw model , i.e. , the minimal seesaw model ( msm ) @xcite , one could introduce only two right - handed neutrinos , whereas the observed neutrino mass hierarchy and lepton flavor mixing can be well interpreted .",
    "such a minimal extension of the sm greatly reduces the number of free parameters , and hence is very predictive .",
    "for instance , in the msm , one of the light neutrinos should be massless since @xmath5 is of rank 2 , which indicates that @xmath6 in the normal hierarchy case while @xmath7 in the inverted hierarchy case with @xmath8 being the light neutrino masses . in case that future cosmological observations set more stringent constraints on the summation of the light neutrino masses , the msm would then be the most plausible underlying model .    recently , plenty of models extended the gauge group with flavor symmetries",
    "are studied in order to understand the lepton flavor mixing . in particular",
    ", the experimentally favored tri - bimaximal mixing pattern  @xcite can be naturally realized in many flavor symmetry models .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate if the neutrino masses and mixing can be realized in the msm based on certain flavor symmetries .",
    "now that there are only two right - handed neutrinos in the msm , the symmetry group @xmath9 should contain at least one two - dimensional representation , if two right - handed neutrinos are located in the same multiplet of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , a three - dimensional representation should be employed in order to accommodate three generations of charged leptons in a natural way . in this sense",
    ", the permutation group @xmath0 appears as an attractive candidate for the msm , since it is one of the smallest discrete groups containing one- , two- and three - dimensional representations .",
    "similar models of the @xmath0 flavor symmetry within the canonical seesaw framework have been intensively studied in the literature  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the msm based on the @xmath0 flavor symmetry . in particular , we shall show that our scheme is rather compact whereas it is compatible with the experimental observation , i.e. , the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern could be easily accommodated .",
    "the remaining parts of the work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec - ii ] , we present the main content of our model , and formulate the general expressions of the lepton mass matrices . one interesting example is given in order to show how the tri - bimaximal mixing is realized .",
    "the information on the higgs potential is also briefly discussed .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : sec - iii ] , we perform a detailed numerical analysis , and illustrate the main results obtained in the model .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec - iv ] .",
    "the discrete group @xmath0 is the permutation group of four distinct objects , which contains 24 group elements and 5 irreducible real representations . among the five representations , two are one - dimensional ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , one is two - dimensional ( @xmath12 ) , and two are three dimensional ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the group properties , i.e. , the kronecker products and the clebsch gordan coefficients , can be found in the appendices of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the total symmetry of our model is then chosen to be @xmath15 under which the lepton content in our model is placed as @xmath16 note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the minimal seesaw model is considered whereas the two right - handed neutrinos are assigned to the trivial representation of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the higgs assignments in our model are given by @xmath17 where the @xmath18 doublets higgs fields are in analogy to these in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas an additional @xmath18 singlet higgs @xmath19 is introduced .",
    "we will show later on that @xmath19 is crucial to ensure the corrected prediction on the neutrino mixing angles as well as the light neutrino masses .",
    "note that we mainly focus our attention on the lepton flavor mixing , and hence do not include the quark sector in our discussions . a simple way to contain",
    "the quark mixing in our model is to make a naive assumption that all the quarks belong to the identity representation , i.e. , @xmath20 , and then the quark flavor mixing and masses can be obtained via the standard yukawa couplings to @xmath21 .    by using the group algebra of @xmath0 , we can write the invariant yukawa couplings for leptons as @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\a_2 \\left[\\left(\\overline{l_2}\\tau_r + \\overline{l_3}\\mu_r\\right)\\xi_1 + \\left(\\overline{l_1}\\tau_r + \\overline{l_3 } e_r\\right)\\xi_2 \\right",

    "the @xmath0 flavor symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higgs scalars , i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "one then arrives at the mass matrix of charged leptons as @xmath30 where we have defined @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) . in general",
    ", all the parameters in the mass matrix can be complex , while in case of cp - conservation , there are totally six real parameters in @xmath35 . for simplicity",
    ", we will take all the parameters to be real , but comment later on the most general case with cp - violating effects .    according to eq .",
    ", the contributions from @xmath36 merely affect the diagonal entries , whereas @xmath24 appear in the off - diagonal elements . in the limit @xmath37",
    ", @xmath35 approximates to a nearly diagonal form , and the charged - lepton masses are solely determined by @xmath38 . note that this is indeed a very realistic scenario if the vevs of @xmath24 are much smaller than those of @xmath36 .",
    "explicitly , the sum of the vevs has to be equal to the electroweak scale , i.e. , @xmath39 . since @xmath21",
    "should also be responsible for the generation of the top - quark mass , one may reasonably take @xmath40 with all the other vevs being much smaller than @xmath41 . in our model , we assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as a result ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath35 are approximately given by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "compared to the charged - lepton masses , one immediately obtains @xmath47 in addition , the diagonalization matrix for @xmath35 is nearly an identity matrix , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "since there are only two right - handed neutrinos in the msm , the dirac mass of neutrinos is a @xmath49 matrix , viz .",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 for @xmath34 . the right - handed neutrino mass matrix in our model is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively . in case of @xmath56 , eq .",
    "leads to the masses of right - handed neutrinos as @xmath57 note that , as aforementioned , the natural scale of @xmath58 relies on the vevs @xmath59 implying @xmath60 .",
    "this in turn helps us to estimate that the right - handed neutrino masses should be around @xmath61 , which turn out to be beyond the scope of forthcoming collider experiments . in case that certain fine - tuning is involved in the seesaw formula , e.g. , the structural cancellation",
    ", one can , at least in principle , bring the masses of right - handed neutrinos down to the electroweak scale , although the naturalness of such low - scale right - handed neutrinos seems questionable .    by using the standard seesaw formula ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath62 , we obtain the light neutrino mass matrix as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath71 is symmetric , and thus can be diagonalized by means of a unitary matrix @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath74 which links the neutrino mass eigenstates with their flavor eigenstates is then given by @xmath75 where the last approximation follows since we have taken the charged - lepton mass matrix to be nearly diagonal . in the standard ( i.e. , ckm - like ) parametrization one has @xmath76 where @xmath77 correspond to the elementary rotations in the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 planes ( parametrized in what follows by three mixing angles @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 contain the dirac and majorana cp - violating phases , respectively .    in order to get the explicit expression of @xmath74 , a fully diagonalization of @xmath71",
    "is involved , and the results are rather tedious . however , since the @xmath71 is of rank 2 , there exists a eigenvector @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 . in case that the light neutrino mass spectrum is inverted hierarchy ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 corresponds to the third column of @xmath74 . compared to eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath89 in view of the experimentally measured maximal atmospheric angle and small reactor mixing angle , the relation @xmath90 has to be fulfilled .",
    "the two non - vanishing masses are then approximately given by @xmath91 + { \\cal o}(r_1,r_2 ) \\",
    "m_2 & \\simeq & m_0 \\left [ 1-\\epsilon_2 - \\sqrt{(1-\\epsilon_2)^2 } \\right ] + { \\cal o}(r_1,r_2)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] no matter what value of @xmath92 one chooses , it is not possible to let the two masses to be nearly degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) , which is indeed required for the inverted mass hierarchy case .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the eigenvector of @xmath71 , we can conclude that the inverted light neutrino mass hierarchy is not compatible with the model .    henceforth , we shall concentrate on the normal hierarchy case , namely @xmath94 . here",
    ", we show one interesting example , in which the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern ( i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) is predicted . concretely",
    ", we make the assumptions that @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "equation now reduces to @xmath100 one observes from eq .",
    "that , with the assumptions above , a @xmath101 symmetry appears in @xmath71 , which generally predicts a maximal atmospheric mixing angle , i.e. , @xmath102 , and a vanishing @xmath103 .",
    "it is then easy to prove that the diagonalization matrix of @xmath71 takes exactly the tri - bimaximal mixing form , i.e. , @xmath104 while the light neutrino masses are given by @xmath105 consequently , both the tri - bimaximal mixing and the normal neutrino mass spectrum ( @xmath94 ) are accommodated .",
    "furthermore , if we relax the assumptions on @xmath106 and @xmath107 , a deviation from the tri - bimaximal mixing can be achieved .",
    "fox example , in the case @xmath108 , the light neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 the neutrino mixing angles are then modified to @xmath112 according to the above equations , the deviations of @xmath113 from their exact tri - bimaximal values are correlated by @xmath114 , and in the limit @xmath115 ( or effectively @xmath116 ) , the exact tri - bimaximal mixing will be reproduced .",
    "note that , the correction to @xmath117 is proportional to @xmath118 , and thus is strongly suppressed for a small @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , @xmath119 is rather stable against @xmath120 corrections  @xcite .",
    "now that the previous discussions rely on the vevs of the scalar fields , we are coming to the question of the possible higgs potential and its minima . apart from the @xmath18 singlets",

    "we proceed to the numerical illustrations .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] . from the upper plot",
    ", one observes that the allowed regions of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are symmetric , which is actually resulted from the @xmath130 symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix .",

    "@xmath132 is allowed but @xmath133 is not , indicating that @xmath19 is required in order to fit the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , for a fixed value of @xmath120 , there are two allowed regions for @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .    since the right - handed neutrino masses are also correlated to @xmath106 , we present in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] the predicted mass ratio between two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "one reads from the figure that the mass ratio is generally larger than 2 showing that the resonant leptogensis mechanism@xcite may not simply apply to this model .",

    "now we turn to the special case with the assumption @xmath138 , namely , a @xmath139 symmetry exists in the neutrino sector .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] .    as we expected",
    ", there exist strong correlations between three mixing angles according to the upper and middle plots .",
    "this is in good agreement with our analytical results aforementioned since the mixing angles are connected by a single parameter @xmath114 .",
    "the most severe constraint comes from @xmath141 , and its experimental allowed range can be fulfilled . as for @xmath103 , an upper bound @xmath142 can be obtained .",
    "as has been shown , @xmath119 is confined to it s tri - bimaximal mixing value , and rather stable compared to the two other mixing angles . in the particularly interesting limit @xmath132",
    ", the exact tri - bimaximal mixing pattern will be reproduced .",
    "finally , from the lower plot , we also find that the right - handed neutrino mass spectrum should be hierarchical , e.g. , @xmath143 .",
    "we stress that our discussions are based on the assumption of real yukawa couplings as well as scalar vevs , whereas in the most general situation , both of them could be complex . in the presence of cp - violating effects , the imaginary parts of the model parameters @xmath144 and @xmath145 could significantly change the predictions addressed here , and we therefore study it further . since the neutrinoless double beta decay process rely on the majorana feature of light neutrinos , we illustrate in fig .

    "in this work , we presented a minimal seesaw model based on the discrete @xmath0 flavor symmetry . in our model , besides the sm fermion content , two right - handed neutrinos are introduced transforming as an @xmath0 doublet .",
    "the structure of the model is minimal in the sense that there are at most two massive light neutrinos which are indeed required to account for the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the number of model parameters are reduced greatly compared to the ordinary type - i seesaw , and thus allow us to make useful predictions on the neutrino parameters .",
    "after carefully exploring the parameter spaces , we found that the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy is ruled out whereas the normal hierarchy can be well accommodated in this framework .",
    "in particular , the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern can be naturally obtained from simple assumptions on the model parameters , while the deviation of three mixing angles from their exact tri - bimaximal mixing values are correlated by a single model parameter .",
    "in addition , the right - handed neutrinos feature a hierarchical mass spectrum , i.e. , the ratio between right - handed neutrino masses is generally larger than 2 .",
    "note that , in the current discussions , we have ignored the cp - violating effects , since there is yet no direct experimental information on leptonic cp violation .",
    "however , in the most general case , the cp - violating phases can be easily included since all the coefficients of yukawa couplings as well as the vevs could in principle be complex .",
    "in fact , the cp - violating effects are very crucial in order to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via thermal leptogenesis mechanism in the seesaw models  @xcite . in addition",
    ", a dirac cp - violating phase may also be searched for at future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "finally , we stress that the right - handed neutrinos may not be necessarily heavy , e.g. , their masses could be located around kev scales .",
    "one may wonder that , in the mass range @xmath148 ( i.e. , the right - handed neutrinos are sterilized ) , if the right - handed neutrinos could be viewed as warm dark matter so as to explain simultaneously the neutrino mass generation and the dark matter puzzle .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible in the current model , since the stability of kev right - handed neutrinos on the cosmic time scale requires the mixing between sterile and active neutrinos to be smaller than @xmath149 , which leads the mass scale of light neutrinos to be about @xmath150  @xcite . such tiny neutrino masses are in conflict with neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "possible variations extending the msm may provide successful warm dark matter candidate , ( e.g. , an additional light right - handed neutrino transforming as a singlet under @xmath0 ) , which are however beyond the scope of current work .",
