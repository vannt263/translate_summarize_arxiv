    "magnetic tunnel junctions with controllable relative orientation of the magnetization in the leads  @xcite are in the focus of current research motivated by their promising application potential as well as general interest in spin - dependent phenomena in complex condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , among various theoretical studies of spin - polarized transport a large body of work has aimed at developing adequate models for the tunneling magnetoresistance in single - particle approximation  @xcite , and by accounting for many - body effects due to electron - magnon interactions in normal  @xcite and superconducting  @xcite states , and the influence of disorder  @xcite .",
    "the subject of the present study is the tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect originating from the dependence of the tunneling current on the relative orientation of the magnetizations in two electrodes separated by a thin insulating layer  @xcite .",
    "usually , the tunnel structure is designed in such a way that in a zero external magnetic field the magnetic moments are antiparallel ( ap ) to each other , and change to the parallel ( p ) configuration upon application of a weak magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the resistances in the ap and p configurations , respectively , the tmr ratio can be defined as @xmath4 , or as @xmath5 in terms of the corresponding conductances @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "as the effect stems from the exchange interaction , it is not surprising that spin - dependent scattering is often seen as the main obstacle for achieving higher tmr ratios  @xcite .",
    "less obvious is that spin - independent elastic scattering can affect the tmr as well  @xcite , in particular in the presence of structural disorder in the insulating barrier .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of disorder - induced mixing of conducting channels with different wave vectors @xmath0 in the junction plane occuring independently for the two spin species . on the other hand , according to julli ` ere s conjecture  @xcite an increase in the amount of barrier disorder should eventually lead to a completely random @xmath0 transfer , with the tmr ratio depending only on electron spin polarizations in the magnetic leads .",
    "the question of how the crossover between the @xmath0-conserving and julli ` ere regimes actually occurs and which of them is most favorable for achieving a higher tmr are the facets of a challenging problem currently under investigation .",
    "although some aspects of this problem have been addressed by numerical techniques  @xcite , we feel that there is an apparent lack of analytical work aimed at proving julli ` ere s conjecture from the general standpoint of statistical theory of quantum transport within a model - based approach .    in the present work we propose an analytically solvable statistical model for spin - polarized tunneling describing the full disorder - driven crossover from the @xmath0-conserving to random tunneling regime .",
    "the model assumes nonresonant long - range defects in the barrier and works in the thermodynamic limit where the crossover is controlled by the defect concentration @xmath8 .",
    "the scenario of the crossover appears quite unusual as depicted in fig .",
    "[ tmr_n ] : first decreasing with @xmath8 at low concentrations , the @xmath9 can eventually recover that of an ideal junction , @xmath10 , or even exceed it approaching an @xmath8-independent value for large defect concentrations . as we demonstrate",
    "later this value corresponds to julli ` ere s tmr for the junctions addressed here . to our knowledge",
    "such a reentrant tmr effect has not been studied previously .",
    "this finding could potentially be used for defect engineering of magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "we also find that the lower the electron spin polarization the stronger is the effect of the long - range disorder .",
    "this to some extent is in line with the experimental observation of a rather weak tmr effect in semiconductor / nonepitaxial iron tunnel junctions  @xcite where one may expect long - range electrostatic disorder in the semiconductor barrier . a quantitative comparison with the experimental data is unfortunately hindered by approximations we have to resort to in order to get an analytically tractable theory .",

    "the barrier inhomogeneity is described by the second term as the superposition of @xmath14 pairs of opposite - sign potentials centered at points @xmath15 and @xmath16 randomly distributed over a large junction area @xmath17 .",
    "we do not distinguish the @xmath18 coordinates of the defects assuming @xmath19 to vary smoothly with @xmath18 across the barrier .",
    "the inhomogeneous part vanishes upon averaging over the junction area so that it represents the lateral spatial fluctuation of the barrier potential around a mean value , @xmath20 ( measured from the fermi level @xmath21 ) .",
    "while capturing generic features of randomly transparent barriers , this model , in particular , describes electrostatic disorder in an overall neutral insulator containing an equal amount of donors and acceptors .",
    "if they are distributed homogeneously , the fermi level remains in the middle of the band gap  @xcite so that at sufficiently low bias voltage and temperature we can neglect resonant tunneling . in the situations where resonant",
