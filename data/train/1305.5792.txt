    "besides its theoretical interest , the role of quantum entanglement has been acknowledged for its wide range of applications in quantum information protocols @xcite and quantum communication @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "one of the key results is the positive partial transposed ( ppt ) separability criterion @xcite , which provides a necessary and , in some cases , a sufficient condition for distinguishing between separable and entangled states in discrete quantum systems .",
    "this criterion was extended to continuous variable systems @xcite by implementing the partial transpose operation as a mirror reflection in the wigner phase - space .",
    "an important application of the `` continuous '' ppt criterion is in the theory of quantum information of gaussian states @xcite , which is at the core of the test beds for estimating quantum correlations @xcite . in this case , the ppt criterion yields both a necessary and sufficient separability condition @xcite . as will be seen , gaussian states are also quite useful for investigating the entanglement exclusively induced by a noncommutative ( nc ) deformation of phase - space .    noncommutativity is believed to be an essential feature of quantum gravity and string theory @xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics ( qm ) and quantum cosmology , phase - space noncommutativity has been shown to exhibit striking features with applications for the black hole singularity @xcite and the equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quantum mechanical aspects of nc theories have focused on studies of the quantum hall effect @xcite , the gravitational quantum well for ultra - cold neutrons @xcite , the landau/@xmath0-oscillator problem in the phase - space @xcite , and as a probe of quantum beating and missing information effects @xcite .",
    "the phase - space nc generalizations of qm are based on extensions of the heisenberg - weyl algebra @xcite . in this letter ,",
    "the ppt entanglement criterion for continuous variable systems is generalized to the case of a phase - space with canonical momentum - momentum and position - position noncommutativity .",
    "two alternative formulations of the new criterion are presented .",
    "the second formulation consists on a condition on the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the partially transposed covariance matrix of the state , and is very efficient from the computational point of view .",
    "we will use it to study in detail the effect of noncommutativity on the quantum nature and separability properties of gaussian states .",
    "most interesting is the conclusion that noncommutativity alone can induce the entanglement of gaussian states . besides its theoretical interest , this result may become important for the experimental tests of nc qm .    for the purpose of quantifying how noncommutativity affects the separability of quantum states , let us consider a bipartite quantum system described in terms of a @xmath1-dimensional subsystem a ( alice ) and a @xmath2-dimensional subsystem b ( bob ) with @xmath3 .",
    "one may write the collective degrees of freedom of the composite system @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the corresponding generalized variables of the two subsystems , which obey the commutation relations @xmath7 = i \\omega_{ij } , \\hspace{1 cm } i , j = 1 , \\cdots , 2n , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where the associated matrix is given by @xmath8 \\equiv",

    "the nc structure can be formulated in terms of commuting variables by considering a linear darboux transformation ( dt ) , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , satisfy the usual commutation relations : @xmath23 = i j_{ij } , \\hspace{1 cm } i , j=1 , \\cdots , 2n .",

    "notice that the map @xmath33 is not uniquely defined .",
    "if we compose @xmath33 with block - diagonal canonical transformations we obtain an equally valid dt .",
    "we will see , however , that our main results are independent of the particular choice of the map @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "let us assume that the composite quantum system is described by the density matrix @xmath35 , function of the nc variables @xmath36 .",
    "the dt yields the density matrix @xmath37 , which is associated with the wigner function : w ( ) = _",

    "finally , for gaussian functions our results yield the following characterization : a real normalizable phase - space gaussian function @xmath94 with covariance matrix @xmath39 is the nc wigner function of a quantum separable state if and only if @xmath39 satisfies the eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) with respect to quantum nature and separability , respectively .",
    "to proceed we reexpress the nc quantumness and separability criteria in terms of the so - called nc symplectic spectrum .",
    "first recall that the _ symplectic spectrum _ of a @xmath47 real symmetric positive - definite matrix @xmath41 is the set of eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath95 and these eigenvalues are called the williamson invariants of @xmath41 .",
    "they are all positive and we denote by @xmath96 the smallest williamson invariant . by williamson s theorem @xcite , one can show that @xmath41 complies with the rsup ( @xmath45 ) if and only if @xmath97 .",
    "by the same token , we call the set of eigenvalues of @xmath98 the _ nc symplectic spectrum _ of @xmath39 and the eigenvalues are called the nc williamson invariants .",
    "we denote by @xmath99 the smallest nc williamson invariant of @xmath39 .    now consider a covariance matrix @xmath39 and let @xmath33 be any dt .",
    "suppose that @xmath100 is related to @xmath39 by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . then we claim that the nc symplectic spectrum of @xmath39 coincides with the symplectic spectrum of @xmath100 . indeed : @xmath101 we then have the following sequence of equivalent statements : @xmath102 in other words , @xmath39 satisfies the nc rsup if and only if its smallest nc williamson invariant satisfies @xmath103 .",
    "now we turn to the separability criterion eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath104 denote the smallest nc williamson invariant of @xmath105 . if @xmath39 is the covariance matrix associated with a nc separable state , then @xmath106",
    ". to summarize , a necessary condition for @xmath39 to be the covariance matrix of a nc quantum state is given by @xmath103 .",
    "likewise , @xmath106 is a necessary condition for @xmath39 to be the covariance matrix of a separable nc quantum state . again ,",
    "if the state is a gaussian both are sufficient criteria .",
    "the nc symplectic spectrum of @xmath39 depends only on @xmath39 and on @xmath88 and hence it is manifestly independent of the dt @xmath33 . consequently , the nc quantum nature condition , @xmath103 , is also independent of @xmath33 . on the other hand ,",
    "the nc symplectic spectrum of @xmath107 is also independent of @xmath33 , provided it is block - diagonal .",
    "this is easily seen , if we consider the fact that the spectrum of @xmath108 is the same as that of @xmath109 and @xmath86 takes the form ( [ eq15.1 ] ) for all block - diagonal dts .",
    "in order to evince the entanglement induced by the noncommutative deformation , let us consider a gaussian state , @xmath111 living on a @xmath112-dimensional nc phase - space with @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , with @xmath117 , and where the covariance matrix is given by , = b2 (    c c * i*_4&*^t * + * * & * i*_4    ) ,    * * = (    c c c c n & 0 & m & 0 + 0 & n & 0 & -m + m & 0 & -n & 0 + 0 & -m & 0 & -n    ) , [ eq20 ] where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are real parameters which we assume , for simplicity , to be constrained by the relations @xmath120 , @xmath121 . in this case , the dt corresponds to the map @xmath122 $ ] , with = * s^b * = (    c c c c & 0 & 0 & -/2 + 0 & & /2 & 0 + 0 & /2 & & 0 + /2 & 0 & 0 &    ) , [ eq21 ] subject to @xmath123 , which ensures the map invertibility .",
