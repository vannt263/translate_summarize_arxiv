    "the electromagnetic field of a moving charged particle whose speed exceeds the speed of light _ in vacuo _ is the subject of several papers written by sommerfeld in 1904 and 1905  @xcite , papers which were regarded to have been superseded by special relativity soon after their publication .",
    "one reason for abandoning further investigations of the work initiated by sommerfeld , of course , was that any known particle that had a charge also had a rest mass and so was barred from moving faster than light by the requirements of special relativity .",
    "but there was an additional reason .",
    "not even a massless particle can move faster than light _ in vacuo _ if it is charged ; for if it does it would give rise to an infinitely strong electromagnetic field on the envelope of the wave fronts that emanate from it .",
    "it was not until the appearance of the works of ginzburg and his coworkers  @xcite that it was realized that , though no superluminal source of the electomagnetic field can be point - like , there are no physical principles disallowing faster - than - light sources that are _ extended_. the coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally moving charged particles of opposite sign can give rise to macroscopic polarization currents whose distribution patterns move superluminally .",
    "the electromagnetic field that is generated by such extended sources , on the other hand , may be built up by the superposition of the fields of their constituent volume elements , elements which individually act as the superluminally moving point sources considered by sommerfeld  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to examine the radiation field of a particular class of such volume - distributed sources : polarization currents whose distribution patterns have the time dependence of a travelling wave with a centripetally - accelerated superluminal motion .",
    "a motivation for this work is the recent design , construction and testing of experimental machines with this characteristic  @xcite .",
    "the green s function for the problem we analyze is the familiar field of a uniformly rotating point source .",
    "this is the linard - wiechert field that is encountered in the analysis of synchrotron radiation , except that here we do not restrict the speed of the source to the subluminal regime .",
    "this uniformly rotating point source is used as a basic volume element of the extended superluminal source , which is then treated in detail by superposing the linard - wiechert fields of its constituent elements .",
    "we find that fundamentally new radiation processes come into play as a result of lifting the restriction to the subluminal regime , processes that have no counterparts in either the synchrotron or the erenkov effects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii presents an introductory description of the principles behind our calculation of the emission .",
    "it includes a definition of frequencies ( table  i ) and polarization ( section iie ) of the source , which are later used to discuss the spectral characteristics and polarization of the emitted radiation .",
    "a detailed mathematical treatment is given in section iii , with the expression describing the nonspherically decaying component of the radiation [ eq .",
    "( 57 ) ] being derived and discussed in section  iiid .",
    "the nonspherically and spherically decaying components of the emission are compared in section  iv , and a summary is given in section  v.",
    "the physical principles underlying the ( mostly unexpected ) consequences of the processes described in section  i are more transparent if we begin with a descriptive account of the building blocks of the ( unavoidably lengthy ) analysis that follows in section  iii .",

    "the radiated field entails , at any instant during this limited time interval , a set of wave envelopes ( each associated with the wave fronts emanating from a specific member of a corresponding set of source elements ) whose cusps pass through the position of the privileged observer in question .",
    "these caustics arise from those volume elements of the source which approach the observer , along the radiation direction , with the speed of light and zero acceleration at the retarded time ( figs .  3 and 4 ) .",

    "the nonspherical decay of the field does not contravene conservation of energy .",

    "the integral of the flux of energy across a large sphere centred on the source is the same as the integral of the flux of energy across any other sphere that encloses the source .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of the emission from a superluminal polarization current whose distribution pattern rotates ( with an angular frequency @xmath0 ) and oscillates ( with a frequency @xmath1 ) at the same time , and which comprises both poloidal and toroidal components . </S>",
    "<S> this type of polarization current is found in recent practical machines designed to investigate superluminal emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the superluminal motion of the distribution pattern of the emitting current generates localized electromagnetic waves that do not decay spherically , i.e.  that do not have an intensity diminishing like @xmath2 with the distance @xmath3 from their source . </S>",
    "<S> the nonspherical decay of the focused wave packets that are emitted by the polarization currents does not contravene conservation of energy : the constructive interference of the constituent waves of such propagating caustics takes place within different solid angles on spheres of different radii ( @xmath3 ) centred on the source . </S>",
    "<S> for a polarization current whose longitudinal distribution ( over an azimuthal interval of length @xmath4 ) consists of @xmath5 cycles of a sinusoidal wave train , the nonspherically decaying part of the emitted radiation contains the frequencies @xmath6 ; i.e.it contains _ only _ the frequencies involved in the creation and implementation of the source . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to recent studies of the spherically decaying emission , which was shown to contain much higher frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of the emitted radiation is found to be linear for most configurations of the source . </S>"
