    "the single parameter scaling ( sps ) hypothesis is the cornerstone of the current understanding of the localization phenomena .",
    "it was originally formulated in terms of the scaling behavior of the conductance of disordered conductors,@xcite where it was suggested that when the length , @xmath1 , of a disordered conductor increases , the evolution of the conductance , @xmath2 , is determined by a single parameter , @xmath3 itself . for one - dimensional systems",
    "landauer s formula @xcite expresses the electron conductance in terms of electron reflection , @xmath4 , and transmission , @xmath5 , coefficients as @xmath6 , and thereby allows the considering of electron transport on an equal footing with these propagation of , for example , light .",
    "it was recognized later that sps must be understood in terms of properties of the entire distribution of @xmath3 ( or @xmath7 ) , and that the most appropriate quantity to deal with is @xcite @xmath8 in the limit of large @xmath1 , this parameter is normally distributed with the average @xmath9 and the variance @xmath10 .",
    "the limiting value of @xmath11 is known in the theory of products of random matrices@xcite as the lyapunov exponent ( le ) .",
    "the inverse quantity , the localization length , @xmath12 , determines the main length scale in the localization regime.@xcite sps in this context means that the variance of @xmath13 is not an independent parameter , but it is determined by @xmath14 itself implying a simple relationship between the two@xcite @xmath15 this expression was obtained for the one - dimensional model in ref . assuming complete randomization of the phases of complex transmission and reflection coefficients over a microscopic length scale @xmath16 ( phase randomization hypothesis ) .",
    "later the phase randomization hypothesis was used by many different authors to rederive eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) ( see , for instance , refs . ) , and the inequality @xmath16 came to be regarded as the criterion for sps .",
    "however , there were earlier signs that the phase randomization hypothesis is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for sps to occur .",
    "for instance , numerical simulations of ref . and analytical calculations of ref .",
    "showed that in the center of a conductivity band of the 1-@xmath0 anderson model , sps holds even though the phase is not randomized , provided that the disorder is weak .",
    "later , numerical simulations of a random , periodic - on - average model@xcite demonstrated a strong violation of sps in the band - gaps of the spectrum of the underlined system without disorder , which existed even for weak disorder and , actually , diminished , when disorder increased .",
    "this was contrary to the behavior found for states from the original conducting band , for which minor deviations of the variance from eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) occured when disorder becomes strong enough.@xcite    the final realization of the fact that the phase randomization hypothesis has nothing to do with sps came in ref . .",
    "in that paper , the variance of le was calculated exactly for the lloyd model and the sps equation ( [ sps ] ) was derived without _ ad hoc _ assumptions .",
    "it was found that the emergence of sps is governed by a new length scale @xmath17 , related to the integral density of states with the new criterion for sps being @xmath18 . on the basis of the exact solutions it was conjectured@xcite that in the region of the spectrum close to its original boundary , the parameter @xmath17 can be defined in a generic case as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lattice constant and @xmath21 is the number of states between the lowest genuine boundary of the spectrum of the disordered system and @xmath22 , normalized by the total number of states in the band ( such that @xmath23 ) .",
    "numerical studies undertaken in ref . evidenced that this assumption was valid for the anderson model and the periodic - on - average model with rectangular distribution of random parameters .",
    "an additional implication of the results of ref .",
    "is that the random matrix theory approach , which also reproduces eq .",
    "( [ sps]),@xcite does not apply to spectral regions with depleted differential density of states .",
    "the objective of this paper is to show that two different scaling regimes governed by the parameter @xmath17 found in ref .",
    "exist also in disordered systems with absorption .",
    "having in mind applications to light propagation in random photonic band gap materials , we consider how the inclusion of small absorption affects scaling properties of transmission .",
    "we show that the conjectured definition of @xmath17 in terms of the integral density of states can also be applied to disordered systems with absorption .    within the phase randomization hypothesis approach ,",
    "statistics of the transmission in lossy one - dimensional dielectrics was considered analytically in a number of papers.@xcite following ref .",
    "the relation between the variance and the localization length in the presence of absorption can be presented in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the absorption length in the absence of randomness , @xmath28 is the exponential integral . in the absence of absorption ,",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) reduces to the regular sps form @xmath29 . in two limiting cases eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) gives the asymptotes @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "presuming that the length scale @xmath17 retains its meaning in the case under consideration , we expect that the parameter @xmath32 deviates from the phase randomization hypothesis prediction @xmath33 [ eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) ] in the vicinity of the boundaries of the spectrum in accordance with the same criterion @xmath34 as in ref . .",
    "using numerical simulations of a periodic - on - average one - dimensional lossy system , we show that , indeed , the parameter @xmath35 sets a valid criterion for validity of eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) . as an additional benefit ,",
    "we demonstrate that within the range of its validity , eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) represents a universal , model independent relation between the variance and the mean value of le .",
    "though the statistics of transmission is determined now by two parameters , one can still regard eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) as a generalization of sps because the absorption length is independent of disorder .",
    "the deviations from the phase - randomization based results of ref . studied in our paper",
    "must be clearly distinguished from results of ref .. in the latter paper brake down of the phase randomization was obtained in the case of very strong disorder and strong absorption for states at the center of the original band .",
    "the results of our paper indicate that ( i ) violation of the generalized single parameter scaling occurs at weak disorders for states close to the band edge of the original spectrum , ( ii ) this violation is not related to the phase randomization but is controlled by the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a classical transverse electromagnetic wave propagating normally through a stack of alternating dielectric slabs with dielectric constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the widths of the stacks of the first kind is distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath38 while the width of the others is being kept constant @xmath39 .",
    "the propagation of the waves in the superlattice consists of free propagation in the slabs and scattering at the interfaces , where the boundary conditions should be satisfied .",
    "it can be described using the transfer matrix formalism for the vector @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the electric field and its derivative at @xmath42-th interface and @xmath43 .",
    "the presence of absorption can be accounted for by adding a constant complex part to the dielectric functions : @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a damping coefficient .",
    "vectors on neighboring interfaces are connected via the transfer matrix @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the transfer matrix of the entire system is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "le is defined through the transmission coefficient for the superlattice : @xmath51 here @xmath52 denotes the average over an ensemble of configurations .",
    "we find that using this definition in numerical simulations has one significant shortcoming . in long systems",
    ", the transmission coefficient @xmath53 falls bellow the computer roundoff accuracy .",
    "the usual remedy for this problem in the absence of absorption is to use an alternative definition of @xmath14 @xmath54 which allows one to consider very long systems.@xcite in the presence of absorption , this definition must be generalized because the simple substitution of the transfer - matrix , eq . ( [ transfer matrix ] ) , in this equation would lead to a wrong result .",
    "the problem is that an exponentially growing eigenvalue of the transfer matrix appears in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ lyap1 ] ) , while in eq .",
    "( [ taltern ] ) it is in the numerator .",
    "therefore , the contribution from absorption enters the final answer for the le with different relative signs in these two equation .",
    "we argue that eq .",
    "( [ taltern ] ) must be modified in order to agree with the original definition of @xmath55 as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a vector of general position .",
    "the proof of equivalency of eq .",
    "( [ lyap1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ lyap2 ] ) goes as follows .",
    "first , we diagonalize the transfer matrix @xmath58 : @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are some unitary matrices . for argument sake , we assume that @xmath62 .",
    "next , we notice the following relation between eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath63 which follows simply from reciprocity of our system",
    ". indeed , propagation of the waves in opposite direction should be described by the matrix @xmath64 ^{-1}$ ] , that leads to eq ( [ recip ] ) .",
    "now , substituting @xmath65 into eqs .",
    "( [ lyap1 ] ) and ( [ lyap2 ] ) ( corrections due to matrices @xmath66 are negligible in the limit @xmath67 ) one obtains @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "taking into account the reciprocity relation eq .",
    "( [ recip ] ) we establishes the equivalency of eqs .",
    "( [ lyap1 ] ) and ( [ lyap2 ] ) .",
    "in numerical simulations we used the following set of parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the disorder parameter , @xmath73 , and the absorption rate , @xmath46 , were variable parameters . to calculate the moments of @xmath74 , we averaged the characteristics of systems as long as @xmath75 layers over @xmath76 realizations .",
    "the size of the stack was chosen to be at least five times the localization length or the absorption length . in the ordered system",
    "the first forbidden gap lies between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . since the localization length depends on the frequency of the wave it is possible to study the function @xmath79 by changing the frequency .",
    "first , we compare our numerical results with the analytical formula of ref . in the region of frequencies",
    "well inside the first allowed band , where we expect these results to coincide . fig .",
    "1 . shows excellent agreement between the computed @xmath80 for @xmath81 and eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) .",
    "the localization length decreases rapidly when the frequency approaches the band edge , while le , consequently , increases . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ sps ] ) , in the absence of absorption , @xmath82 should follow the le .",
    "2 depicts the dependence of le and its variance with and without absorption .",
    "as one can see , at the band edge , @xmath77 , sps breaks down .",
    "indeed , while le grows with the increasing frequency , the variance drops in both cases , with and without absorption .    in order to compare numerical and analytical results in the presence of absorption , we calculated the parameter @xmath32 as a function of frequency @xmath83 , using the data presented in fig .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "3 , from which one can see that the computed @xmath84 deviates from @xmath85 that represents eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) , and that this deviation occurs at the same frequency at which @xmath86 deviates from unity .",
    "these graphs convincingly demonstrate , that even in the presence of absorption , the spectrum of the system is separated in groups with different scaling properties , and that the boundary between the groups coincide with the boundary of the original spectrum .",
    "the next question we need to address is whether the transition between the scaling regimes is governed by the same parameter @xmath17 that was introduced in ref . .",
    "according to that paper , the new parameter @xmath17 becomes greater than the localization length at the band edge , which results in a deviation from sps .",
    "using definition of @xmath17 suggested in ref .",
    "regarding the integrated density of states , eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) , we numerically calculated this parameter for the system studied in the present paper .",
    "the density of states was calculated using the phase formalism ( see , for instance , ref . ) for the system without absorption .",
    "4 shows all relevant length parameters : localization length , absorption length and @xmath17 .      at the band edge",
    ", @xmath17 grows rapidly because very few new states appear within the former bandgap , and @xmath21 must already be close to unity at the band edge .",
    "it reaches unity at a new fluctuation boundary of the spectrum near the center of the gap .",
    "we assume that the disorder is not very strong such that the fluctuation boundaries inside former bandgaps do exist . if the disorder is strong enough , or if its statistical properties are such that the entire bandgap is filled with fluctuation states a definition of @xmath17 is still possible , but the situation becomes more complicated , and we do not consider it here . at certain points",
    "@xmath17 grows larger than the localization length @xmath87 , and one can find comparing figs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , that @xmath84 starts deviating from @xmath85 at the same frequency . in order to make this more transparent , it is convienient to plot various @xmath88 s versus @xmath89 .    without absorption ,",
    "we see the crossover to sps in its pure form at @xmath90 reported in refs . .",
    "when absorption is present , the crossover still occurs at @xmath90 , but now to the modified sps behavior @xmath91 .",
    "we stress that the crossover occurs while @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , so that the system remains in the meaningful scaling regime .",
    "this demonstrates that the condition @xmath96 establishes the criterion for modified sps even in the presence of the absorption .    to check that our results are not model specific we also studied the anderson model , with absorption introduced as a nonrandom imaginary part of the on - site random energy . in the anderson model without disorder and absorption , there is a single allowed band form @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "figure 6 shows that @xmath84 deviates from @xmath99 at the edges of the allowed band as would be expected on the basis of the results presented for the periodic - on - average system . inside the conductivity band ,",
    "numerical and analytical results show excellent agreement .",
    "this is interesting in itself , since eq .",
    "( [ sps_abs ] ) was derived for a continuous model , @xcite and we see that in the sps regime it holds also for the tight - binding discrete model .      in conclusion , we computed the lyapunov exponent and its variance for a periodic - on - average layered system and for the one - dimensional anderson model .",
    "we studied the deviation from the absorption - modified sps expression for the variance.@xcite we showed that the new length scale , introduced in ref . in order to explain violation of sps in the systems without absorption , retains its significance when absorption is present .",
    "we also showed that the same criterion @xmath100 derived for lossless systems in ref .",
    "controls scaling behavior in lossy systems ."
