    "a common explanation for drastic population declines due to over - harvest is the _ tragedy of the commons _ @xcite .",
    "under open - access conditions , where profits go to individual users , and losses in future harvest are shared by all users , each user has an incentive to drive the resource to low levels @xcite .",
    "however , in classic open - access harvest models , tragedy of the commons does not explain population extinctions , because the price per unit harvest is fixed and therefore , the cost of finding and extracting rare individuals eventually exceeds the price achieved from selling the harvested resource @xcite .",
    "prices are not fixed ; they depend on market dynamics that reflect how much consumers are willing to pay for the resource . for food , art , and other consumer goods , derived from harvested plants and animals , prices often increase with species rarity @xcite .",
    "products from rare species become luxury goods , status symbols or financial investments for the wealthy ( e.g. rhino horn , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where exorbitant prices paid by consumers incentivize harvesters to absorb the high costs of searching for and killing the last few individuals .",
    "this phenomenon is called the  anthropogenic allee effect \" ( aae ) where species rarity increases price , and therefore the incentive to harvest , driving small populations extinct .",
    "it is named after the classic ecological concept of a _ strong allee effect _",
    ", where populations decline towards zero only if they start below a critical threshold size [ due to mate limitation for example ] @xcite .",
    "proposed in 2006 , @xcite aae theory argues that price increasing with species rarity induces an allee threshold for which populations above the threshold will be sustainably harvested and populations below the threshold will go extinct .    despite significant traction in the literature ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there has been no formal analysis validating the existence of an aae in open - access harvest models . in this paper",
    ", we propose a general class of models , which demonstrate that the intuitive arguments for an aae @xcite can lead to erroneous conclusions . in fact , from a conservation perspective , the situation may be worse than original aae theory would suggest .",
    "the models produce a rich set of dynamics with the possibility of classic lotka - voltera predator - prey cycles , saddle equilibria where the allee population threshold depends on initial harvest effort , and even cases where populations at densities far above the anthropogenic allee threshold are destined to perish .",
    "consider humans harvesting a population of size @xmath0 , with harvest effort @xmath1 . in the absence of harvest",
    ", the population grows at rate @xmath2 .",
    "individuals are harvested at a rate proportional to the product of harvest effort and population density .",
    "harvesters choose to increase their effort if harvest is profitable and decrease their effort if it is unprofitable , which is achieved by letting the change in harvest effort be proportional to the revenue , minus the cost .",
    "assuming the cost of harvest per unit effort , @xmath3 , is constant , and the price for harvested individuals , @xmath4 , is a function of population abundance , the above description can be written as ,    @xmath5\\label{market}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath6 controls the rate at which harvest effort changes with respect to market information .",
    "high values of @xmath6 mean harvesters change effort quickly .",
    "we assume all parameters are greater than or equal to zero .",
    "we assume a price abundance relationship , @xmath7 where , @xmath8 is the minimum price paid per unit harvest when the species is abundant , and @xmath9 is the price when @xmath10 . for all @xmath11 , price is highest when the species is rare ( small @xmath0 ) .",
    "large @xmath12 values mean that price decreases more steeply as the population becomes abundant , i.e. increases more steeply with rarity ( see fig [ px ] ) .",
    "( sensitivity of price to population size ) when @xmath8 ( minimum price consumers pay when the species is abundant ) is one , and @xmath13 ( the increased price over @xmath8 when there is only one individual ) is three . because @xmath14 and @xmath15 , when there is only one individual , price is four in all of these curves . ]",
    "in the following three sections we assume @xmath16 , meaning as the population size approaches infinity , price per unit harvest approaches zero , and then relax this assumption later .    when harvesters receive a constant price @xmath13 , independent of species rarity ( i.e. when @xmath17 ) , this model reduces to exactly the classic lotka - voltera predator prey equations from ecology , where harvesters are predators and the harvested population is prey . but it turns out , there is a wide range of price functions that lead to solutions qualitatively identical to classic predator - prey cycles ( see * ? ? ? * for an introduction to predator prey models ) .",
    "there is one positive equilibrium at    @xmath18    as long as @xmath19 .",
    "as an aside , @xmath20 , is the case where both price and cost per unit harvest are constant multiples ( @xmath13 and @xmath21 respectively ) of @xmath22 . if @xmath23 , per - unit harvest cost is higher than price at all population abundances , and if @xmath24 , cost is always lower than price",
    "thus , extinction always occurs if @xmath25 and persistent growth always occurs if @xmath26 and the equilibrium above does not exist ( as price and cost per unit harvest never cross ) .    in the case where price declines less steeply than per unit harvest costs , @xmath27 , the system behaves like the classic lotka - voltera predation model , with oscillatory population size and harvest effort , with the amplitude of the osculations depending on initial conditions ( fig .",

    "the dependence on @xmath12 is more complicated , but the slope increases with @xmath12 as long as @xmath25 .",
    "this means that for high values of population growth rate , harvest cost , and harvest effort adjustment rate , the separatrix becomes a near vertical line , such that no matter the initial harvest effort , small populations to the left of the line are destined to extinction , and large populations destined to longterm growth ( as is the case in classic aae theory ) . for low values of these parameters , the fate of the population is more heavily influenced by initial harvest effort .",

    "the condition is satisfied for all @xmath4 , with @xmath11 , studied in this paper , and the requirement is necessary because in standard open access models , the cost of harvest approaches infinity as the stock approaches zero . if price were bounded and costs were not , then an additional low harvest equilibrium would exist and it would be stable ( or a center ) , because cost would be greater than price for infinitesimally small population sizes . while extinctions are possible using alternative price functions , this requires modification to other model components , such as adding an ecological allee effect @xcite .",
    "as stated previously , our model is undefined for @xmath37 .",
    "as @xmath92 , @xmath93 , so when simulating the dynamics , it is important to stop the simulations when @xmath1 reaches a high threshold value .    the theory behind the aae is developed using models where price , @xmath4 , is a function of population abundance @xcite . in the _ theory of supply and demand _",
    ", population abundance can be viewed as  potential \" supply ( i.e. the amount of the resource available for harvest at any given time ) , however the actual supply to the market , is a function of both abundance and harvest effort , namely @xmath94 .",
    "there are a few open - access fishery models that set price as a function of supply , @xmath95 , @xcite and while none of these models predict an aae exactly as it is described in classic aae theory @xcite , these models do not consider a general class of price functions studied here . while there is strong evidence that price is negatively correlated with species abundance @xcite",
    ", there is also evidence that price of traded wildlife products decreases with market supply ( e.g. captive parrot abundance in australian bird markets * ? ? ?",
    "population abundance in the wild could strongly co - vary with total harvest supplied to the market , and therefore the most appropriate model for price may be difficult to determine .",
    "lastly , this model only considered the harvest of a single species .",
    "an alternative explanation of population extinctions , to the aae , is called opportunistic exploitation , where harvesters catch rare species if they happen to encounter them while harvesting more common ones @xcite .",
    "models that incorporate multi - species harvest and price abundance relationships have yet to be explored .",
    "in this paper we found that standard arguments for the existence of an anthropogenic allee effect ( aae ) @xcite can provide misleading intuition . in cases where classic arguments would predict sustainable harvest @xcite ,",
    "the approach to a sustainable equilibrium can be slow and oscillatory , with minimum population sizes close to zero .",
    "in such cases , population extinction is probable due to demographic and environmental stochasticity , or processes that reduce population growth at low abundances ( i.e. ecological allee effects ) @xcite .    in cases where there is a harvest induced allee threshold ,",
    "this threshold is not solely based on population size , as previously described in the literature @xcite , but also depends on initial harvest effort . despite predictions of persistence in classic aae theory , populations above the allee threshold can go extinct if initial harvest effort is high . in reality",
    ", harvest effort can suddenly vary due to external forces ( such as economic crises ) , a factor that could drive populations extinct , even when aae theory would predict stable population sizes .",
    "when price is not allowed to decline below a critical value , populations close to carrying capacity , and suffering only minimal initial harvest , are destined to extinction . in such cases ,",
    "only a small range of initial population sizes and harvest efforts lead to long term persistent populations .",
    "this is all despite the fact that classic aae theory would predict that these large populations would remain abundant , leading to a false sense of security .    in the original aae model @xcite ,",
    "populations that start above the anthropogenic allee threshold are argued to never decrease .",
    "but then how do populations ever get below this proposed threshold to begin with ?",
    "possibilities include events unrelated to price - rarity relationships , such as natural disasters and environmental stochasticity .",
    "our equations for the graphical models proposed in the classic papers @xcite , reveal a potential mechanism for how harvested , abundant populations can decline below the anthropogenic allee threshold towards extinction .",
    "the intuition is as follows : the harvest of initially abundant populations increases gradually due to a slightly profitable fixed price , but then once the population reaches a small enough density such that harvest is no longer profitable , the population is too close to the aae threshold and harvesters can not adjust their effort quickly enough to prevent surpassing it . after crossing",
    "the threshold the population goes extinct ( see the outer black curve in [ lafig]a ) .",
    "the difference in population trajectories produced by models with only subtle differences in price abundance relationships is alarming .",
    "data for both prices of wildlife products in combination with estimates of population abundance are difficult to obtain and are likely sensitive to many external social , economic and environmental factors . while the aae is used to inform conservation decisions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we warn that without an understanding of how price is affected by species abundance , it may be difficult to predict population responses to conservation interventions and thus determine the best management actions to protect overexploited species . therefore , it is important to consider a wide range of likely scenarios in order to make sure decisions are robust to differences in price - abundance relationships ( * ? ? ? * in review ) .",
    "if the best decisions are not robust across scenarios , one must consider the value of resolving model uncertainty @xcite , in price abundance relationships , for making effective management decisions .",
