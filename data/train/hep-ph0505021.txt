    "our knowledge of neutrinos has undergone a major revolution in the last seven years .",
    "there is now convincing evidence for nonzero neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "most of the data seem to be consistent with a picture of three active neutrinos @xmath4 having mass and mixing among themselves . while two of the three mixings that characterize the three neutrino system i.e. @xmath5 corresponding to solar neutrino oscillation and @xmath6 corresponding to that for atmospheric neutrinos are fairly well determined , the third mixing angle @xmath7 has only an upper limit@xcite and is the subject of many future experiments@xcite .    in anticipation of the results from the planned experiments ,",
    "there has been theoretical speculations about possible meaning of the existence of a small or `` large '' @xmath7@xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility which has been inspired by the experimental observation of near maximal atmospheric mixing angle ( @xmath6 ) and small upper limit on @xmath7 is that there may be an approximate @xmath0 interchange symmetry in the neutrino sector@xcite .",
    "even though large mass difference between the muon and the tau would appear to go against it , in supersymmetric theories where the muons and the neutrinos get mass from different higgs fields , we may have a situation where an exact @xmath0 symmetry prevails at high scale but at lower scales it may only survive in the @xmath8 sector but not in the @xmath9 sector .",
    "examples of this type exist in literature@xcite .",
    "the next generation of @xmath7 searches can throw light on this symmetry@xcite making it an important idea to pursue .",
    "approximate @xmath0 symmetry has also interesting implications for the origin of matter via leptogenesis@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss another application of the idea of @xmath0 symmetry for neutrinos .",
    "while most of the present data have been discussed in the context of a three neutrino picture , the results of the lsnd experiment@xcite , if confirmed by the mini - boone@xcite experiment currently in progress would require that there be one@xcite or two sterile neutrinos@xcite that mix with the active ones .",
    "the sterile neutrinos must have a mass in the range of an ev , thereby posing a major challenge for theories since being standard model singlets the sterile neutrinos could in principle have a mass of order of the planck scale .",
    "there exist a number of interesting proposals in literature to explain the lightness of the sterile neutrino@xcite and in this paper we show that this can happen in the context of the conventional seesaw mechanism@xcite which is anyway needed to understand the small masses of the known neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , with four neutrinos mixing with each other , it becomes difficult to make any predictions for the various mass matrix elements .",
    "our model has the additional advantage that in the cp conserving case , the symmetries of the theory allow us to write down all the elements of the @xmath2 mass matrix .",
    "for some examples where predictions for the four neutrino case have been attempted , see @xcite .",
    "the seesaw mechanism introduces three right handed neutrinos to the standard model . since the right handed neutrinos are sterile with respect to known weak interactions , it has often been speculated as to whether one of them can somehow be ultralight and play the role of the sterile neutrino while at the same time maintaining the conventional seesaw mechanism for the active neutrinos . clearly , the only way it can happen is if one can `` turn off '' the expected large mass of one of them without effect of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the first example of a model where such a situation arises was proposed in ref.@xcite where the neutrino sector was assumed to obey an @xmath10 symmetry . in this case ,",
    "one of the three right handed neutrinos becomes massless instead of being supermassive as in the usual seesaw case while the other two become superheavy .",
    "the latter become responsible for the smallness of the masses of two of the active neutrinos via seesaw .",
    "the third one does not need a superheavy seesaw partner since it also remain exactly massless as a consequence of the symmetry .",
    "the effect of the symmetry is therefore essentially to turn the @xmath11 seesaw into a @xmath12 one .",
    "then turning on small deviations from this symmetry one can generate tiny mass for the @xmath13 as well as small mixings with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "using this idea , one could write models for both 3 + 1@xcite as well as 2 + 2 @xcite scenarios .",
    "in this paper , we point out that in the context of a generalized seesaw model , a somewhat simpler symmetry @xmath16 , leads to a predictive @xmath1 picture for the lsnd experiment which is consistent with all observations .",
    "as noted earlier , there are additional motivation to consider such symmetries .",
    "we assume that the usual seesaw mechanism or more precisely the right handed neutrino mass matrix originates from an effective field theory whose ultraviolet completion contains the double seesaw form of the neutrino mass matrix @xcite operating above the seesaw scale .",
    "the @xmath16 is assumed to operate at this high scale .",
    "we then assume that there is a low scale symmetry breaking which gives mass to the sterile neutrino as well as its mixings with the active neutrinos .",
    "we find that in the absence of cp violation , as long as @xmath17 symmetry is exact , we can predict the full @xmath2 neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the active neutrinos have an inverted hierarchy .",
    "we further point out that once we include cp violation , even though active neutrino hierarchy is inverted , there is no lower bound on the effective mass probed by the @xmath18 decay .",
    "we also show that the same strategy can be extended to generate a natural @xmath3 model for lsnd where one of the sterile neutrino is the right handed seesaw partner and another is a standard model singlet employed to implement the double seesaw scheme . in the same way as in the @xmath1 case , for the cp conserving case , here also can we predict all elements of the @xmath19 neutrino mass matrix using existing fits to oscillation data .",
    "the basic idea for getting the 3 + 1 model from the type i seesaw was outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the seesaw formula for light neutrino mass matrix is given by : @xmath20 suppose we have a symmetry @xmath21 in the theory that leads to @xmath22 with only one of the eigenvalues zero .",
    "if the same symmetry also guarantees that @xmath23 , then one can use the seesaw formula . the way to proceed is to `` take out '' the zero mass eigen states from both @xmath24 and @xmath25 and then use the seesaw formula for the @xmath12 system .",
    "it is then clear that the spectrum will consist of two light majorana neutrinos ( predominantly left - handed ) , two heavy right handed majorana neutrinos ; one massless right handed neutrino , which will play the role of the sterile neutrino of the 3 + 1 model and a massless left - handed neutrino . breaking the symmetry",
    "@xmath21 very weakly or by loop effects can lead to a nonzero mass for the sterile neutrino as well as its mixings with the @xmath26 so that one has an explanation of the lsnd result via @xmath27 process .",
    "as already noted in @xcite , @xmath21 was chosen to be @xmath10 . here",
    "we take a different path .",
    "we consider a model based on the gauge group @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to the standard model matter we have @xmath29 singlets @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with quantum numbers given in table @xmath34 ( we do not bring in the quark sector , whose gauge quantum numbers are obvious ) . here",
    "we have used the supersymmetric chiral field notation and dropped the chirality ( l , r ) indices .",
    "the superpotential involving these fields can be written as follows : @xmath35    the couplings @xmath36 are all @xmath11 matrices in flavor space whose properties are constrained by the symmetry @xmath37 as discussed below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     under @xmath17 symmetry , the left handed leptonic doublets @xmath38 transform into each other ; similarly under @xmath39 , @xmath40 transform into each other .",
    "invariance under this symmetry then restricts the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 as follows : @xmath43 and @xmath44 the matrix @xmath45 on the other hand has an arbitrary symmetric form .",
    "our considerations are independent of whether the mass matrix elements are real or complex .",
    "we keep them complex to be quite general .    the superpotential of eq .",
    "( 2 ) leads to the following double seesaw form for the neutrino mass matrix at the scale @xmath46 : @xmath47 the zeros in this mass matrix can be guaranteed by an extra @xmath48 symmetry under which the fields @xmath49 and @xmath50 have charges @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "note that we do not include a @xmath53 superfield in the theory .    in order to obtain the light neutrino masses and mixings ,",
    "we proceed in two steps : first , we decouple the s - fermions whose masses are above the scale @xmath54 and write down the effective theory below that scale .",
    "the effective @xmath55 mass matrix below this mass scale can be written as : @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we see that determinant of the @xmath57 mass matrix @xmath58 vanishes and the zero mass eigenstate is given by @xmath59 .",
    "we `` take out ''",
    "this state and the remaining right handed neutrino mass matrix is @xmath12 involving only the states @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , we can take out the state @xmath61 from the dirac mass matrix @xmath62 again leaving a @xmath12 mass matrix in the basis as @xmath63 as already noted the seesaw matrix is now a two generation matrix giving two light majorana neutrino states .",
    "the other active light neutrino state is the massless state @xmath61 .",
    "the light sterile neutrino state is the massless state @xmath64 .",
    "this therefore provides the starting ingredient of the 3 + 1 sterile neutrino model .",
    "having explained why the sterile neutrino is light , we now proceed to make it a realistic model for lsnd by putting a mass term of order ev for @xmath13 and smaller off diagonal mixings for @xmath13 with the active neutrinos .",
    "these small scales could arise from a scalar field having a kev scale vev as in ref.@xcite which can also help us to avoid the wmap bound@xcite .",
    "so in the basis @xmath65 , we have a mass matrix of the form @xmath66 there are two cases that one can consider : ( i ) only @xmath39 is broken so that the massless state @xmath67 remains decoupled and we have a @xmath11 mass matrix with involving @xmath68 and ( ii ) when all four states are mixed and both the interchange symmetries are broken .",
    "the second case is similar to a recent analysis in ref.@xcite .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix in this case is a @xmath2 matrix which in weak ( flavor ) basis can be written as @xmath69 equality of certain entries in this matrix is a reflection of the unbroken symmetry .",
    "this matrix in general has six real parameters and three complex phases . to diagonalize this matrix",
    ", we first note that without mixing terms @xmath70 , the diagonalizing orthogonal matrix is given by    @xmath71    where @xmath72,and @xmath73 is solar mixing angle and eignevalues @xmath74 note that the vanishing of the mass of the third eigenstate is due to unbroken @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "this case has inverted hierarchy for active neutrino masses .    in the limit",
    "where the sterile neutrino decouples , @xmath0 symmetry would have dictated that we have four parameters describing the @xmath11 neutrino mass matrix .",
    "however , in our case , the effective theory has a higher symmetry @xmath75 . as a result ,",
    "since there are three experimental inputs i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath77 and sin@xmath78 , the three neutrino mass matrix in our case is completely fixed by data . using the best fit values @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite , the mass matrix of active neutrinos is given by @xmath81 we have ignored cp violation in this discussion . from eq.(12 ) , we can read off the value for the effective neutrino mass @xmath82 probed by @xmath18 experiment .",
    "it is nothing but the @xmath83 entry in eq.(12 ) and we find that the central value of @xmath84 mev . in this decoupled case , of course , we can not accomodate the lsnd results since the decoupling essentially amounts to very small mixings .    including the effect of the small terms @xmath85 so that lsnd mixings are accomodated in the picture as originally intended , leads to the following form for the generalized @xmath2 pmns matrix .",
    "@xmath86    where @xmath87 the mass eigenvalues now get shifted to the values @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "lsnd results require that @xmath90 .",
    "naturalness would require that @xmath91 implying that @xmath92 ev .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of this which fits the central values of all observed parameters is given below .",
    "unlike the case when the sterile neutrino is decoupled , here we have six parameters describing the four neutrino mass matrix in the absence of cp violation .",
    "all the elements of the mass matrix can therefore be determined using @xmath76 , @xmath93 and sin@xmath78 from @xcite as well as @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96@xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 and find ( ignoring cp phases ) that the four neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath100 we see that in the absence of cp violation , the value of @xmath101 mev .",
    "this is accessible to the proposed searches for neutrinoless double beta decay@xcite .",
    "we can extend @xmath102 to the more general case where the @xmath17 symmetry is also broken . in this case , the neutrino mass matrix has all entries arbitrary except that @xmath103 is the largest entry in it . since @xmath17 is broken weakly , the @xmath102 matrix can be written as @xmath104 @xmath7 in this case will be proportional to the small @xmath17 breaking .",
    "however , in this case , even in the absence of cp violation , one can not predict the neutrino matrix fully .",
    "an interesting implication of the sterile neutrino is its impact on the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , if cp phases are completely ignored , we get a definite prediction for the effective double beta decay mass @xmath82 which is the @xmath83 entry of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "once cp violation is included , the situation changes and we have the effective electron neutrino mass given by @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the atmospheric and the lsnd mass squared differences .",
    "note that which @xmath82 can be large ( if there is no accidental cancellation as was the case in eq .",
    "( 15 ) ) with latexmath:[\\[<m_{ee}>^{max } = \\sqrt{\\delta m^2_{atm } } +    @xmath34 we present a scatter plot for @xmath82 as function of @xmath108 .",
    "one can see that there is a parameter range where the rate of @xmath109 process almost vanishes , which implies that there is cp violation due to sterile neutrino sector .     in the case of inverted hierarchy in the presence of a sterile neutrino with mass @xmath110 1 ev as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "note that the minimum value of @xmath112 depends on the best fit value for the lsnd mixing parameter in a 3 + 1 scheme .",
    "the scatter of points is due to the variation of the phases @xmath113 and @xmath114 between @xmath115 to @xmath116 . ]",
    "thus the well known lower bound on neutrinoless double beta decay in the case of inverted hierarchy@xcite disappears once the effect of sterile neutrino is included .",
    "in other words , if mini - boone confirms lsnd results , a null result in the next round of double beta decay experiments will not necessarily rule out the inverted hierarchy scenario for neutrinos nor the majorana nature of the neutrino .",
    "for example , in the absence of the sterile neutrino , if there was no signal for @xmath18 decay at the level of 30 mev and if long base line experiments confirmed that neutrinos have inverted hierarchy , one would have concluded that the neutrino could be a dirac fermion .",
    "the presence of the sterile neutrino would clearly change this conclusion .",
    "this is an important effect of the presence of the lsnd sterile neutrino .",
    "we also note that the neutrino mass inferred from the study of the shape of the electron energy spectrum near the end point of radioactive nuclear decay is @xmath117 this is below the present expectations in the katrin experiment@xcite but is of interest for future studies in this area .",
    "in this section , we discuss how our strategy can be extended to obtain a @xmath3 model for lsnd .",
    "there are several ways to achieve this .",
    "the essential new step is to extend the discrete symmetry to @xmath118 and introduce an additional singlet fermion .",
    "this implies that in the symmetry limit only the combination @xmath119 field has mass and there are two massless sterile neutrinos : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we can now give mass to them as well as mixings by including the majorana mass terms of type @xmath122 where @xmath45 is inthe ev range , that break @xmath123 part of the discrete group while keeping @xmath17 unbroken .",
    "the form of the mass matrix in this case is given by @xmath124 this reduces to the form in eq .",
    "( 5 ) as @xmath45 becomes large giving two light active neutrinos via the double seesaw as discussed previously .    with 2 sterile neutrinos with @xmath0 symmetry",
    ", the general mass matrix can be written as @xmath125 the parameter @xmath126 can be set to zero by a rotation of the two sterile neutrinos leaving a total of nine parameters .",
    "compared with 3 + 1 scheme , we have three extra parameters , @xmath127,@xmath128,@xmath129 . from the experiment data",
    "fit , we have @xmath130@xcite , which has three more inputs , we can determine the full mass matrix ( in the absence of any cp phases ) .",
    "now the @xmath19 pmns matrix u is given by    @xmath131    all the elements of the mass matrix can be determined using @xmath132 and @xmath133 as well as @xmath134@xcite .",
    "corresponding to the two solutions in @xcite we get two solutions for the mass matrix .    with the best fit data ( i ) @xmath135@xcite . @xmath136    with the best fit data ( ii ) @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath138    in both the cases , there is a prediction for @xmath139 mev , which is very similar to the @xmath1 case without cp violation .",
    "once cp violating phases are included , there is an effect on @xmath140 .",
    "the effects for both cases are again similar to the @xmath1 case .",
    "in summary , we have presented an example where using a simple discrete symmetry , one gets one of the seesaw right handed neutrinos to play the role of a light sterile neutrino needed to understand the lsnd results .",
    "the discrete symmetries used are experimentally motivated by the near maximal value of the atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "the model not only can accomodate the lsnd results , but we find that due to the symmetries used to generate the light sterile neutrino , all elements of the neutrino mass matrix are determined by present data if cp phases are ignored . once cp violation is included , the lower bound on the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay known for the three neutrino case with inverted hierarchy is eliminated .",
    "thus confirmation of lsnd results by mini - boone experiment will not only revolutionize our thinking about the nature of new physics beyond the standard model ( by requiring the concepts such as mirror neutrinos or leptonic symmetries or something else ) but it will also affect our conclusions about whether the neutrino is a majorana or dirac fermion . we further show that our strategy and analysis can be very simply extended to the @xmath3 scenario for lsnd , with similar results .",
