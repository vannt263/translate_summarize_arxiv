    "<S> we obtain limits on the electromagnetic and weak dipole moments of the tau - lepton in the framework of a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) and a class of @xmath0 inspired models with an additional neutral vector boson @xmath1 . using as an input the data obtained by the l3 and opal collaborations for the reaction @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we get a stringent limit on the lrsm mixing angle @xmath3 , @xmath4 , which in turn induces bounds on the tau weak dipole moments which are consistent with the bounds obtained recently by the delphi and aleph collaborations from the reaction @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also get similar bounds for the weak dipole moments of the tau lepton in the framework of @xmath0 superstring models . </S>"
