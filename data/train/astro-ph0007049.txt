    "more than a third of all x - ray clusters with luminosities @xmath3 possess diffuse radio halos ( giovannini , tordi , & feretti 1999 ) . based on energy arguments and circumstantial evidence ,",
    "these radio halos are believed to be caused by synchrotron emission from shock - accelerated electrons during the merger events of their host clusters ( harris et al .",
    "1980 ; tribble 1993 ; feretti 2000 ; see liang et al .",
    "2000 for references to alternative , less successful models ) .",
    "these highly - relativistic electrons cool primarily through inverse - compton scattering off the microwave background .",
    "since their cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical time of their host cluster , the radio emission is expected to last as long as the shock persists and continues to accelerate fresh electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "intergalactic shocks also occur along the filaments and sheets that channel mass into the clusters .",
    "these structures , also traced by the galaxy distribution ( e.g. doroshkevich et al . 1996 ) , are induced by gravity and form due to converging large - scale flows in the intergalactic medium .    in a previous paper ( loeb & waxman 2000 )",
    ", we have shown that most of the diffuse @xmath0ray background ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) might have been generated by the shocks resulting from the formation of large - scale structure in the intergalactic medium .",
    "these shocks produce a population of highly - relativistic electrons with a maximum lorentz factor @xmath4 that scatter a small fraction of the microwave background photons in the present - day universe up to @xmath0-ray energies , thereby providing the @xmath0-ray background .",
    "the predicted flux agrees with the observed diffuse background over more than four decades in photon energy , provided that the fraction of shock energy carried by relativistic electrons is @xmath5 ( a value consistent with that inferred for supernovae shocks ) .",
    "the brightest shocks are caused by the accretion onto ( or mergers of ) x - ray clusters .",
    "the same electrons that emit @xmath0-rays by inverse - compton scattering of microwave background photons , also produce synchrotron radiation in the radio band due to intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the existence of magnetic fields with an amplitude @xmath6 g , is inferred in cluster halos ( kim et al . 1989 ; fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; rephaeli et al . 1999 ; kaastra et al .",
    "1999 ) , and is also required for the fermi acceleration of these electrons .",
    "the appearance of radio halos around young x - ray clusters is therefore a natural consequence and an important test of our model for the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background .",
    "the combination of radio and @xmath0-ray data can be used to calibrate @xmath7 and determine the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "the intergalactic synchrotron emission contaminates the microwave background anisotropies ",
    "relic from the epoch of recombination , and as such needs to be considered in the design and analysis of anisotropy experiments at low frequencies .",
    "previous estimates of synchrotron contamination of the cosmic anisotropies focused on galactic emission , which occurs primarily at low galactic latitudes and large angular scales ( tegmark et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this _ letter _ , we calculate the intergalactic synchrotron contribution to the fluctuations in the radio sky as a function of frequency and angular scale .",
    "we assume that most of the emission originates from the virialization shocks around x - ray clusters , and use the press - schechter mass function to describe the abundance of such clusters as a function of redshift .",
    "our simplified analytic calculation should be regarded only as a first estimate of the synchrotron fluctuations and could be refined with future numerical simulations ( keshet et al .",
    "2000 ) . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the popular set of cosmological parameters ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in  2 we describe the method of the calculation . in ",
    "3 we discuss the results and their main implications .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  4 .",
    "let us first consider the luminosity produced by inverse - compton and synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated to high energies in the accretion shock around a halo of mass @xmath14 at a redshift @xmath15 .",
    "assuming that the shock is strong ( i.e. the gas is not pre - heated ) , the population of shock - accelerated electrons acquires a number versus energy distribution with a power law index , @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inverse - compton luminosity is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the average particle mass in the gas including electrons ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is the post shock temperature , @xmath22 is the maximum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) , @xmath23 is the mass accretion rate across the virialization shock , and @xmath7 is the fraction of thermal shock energy carried by relativistic electrons .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity is then given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the energy densities of the post shock magnetic - field and the cosmic microwave backround ( cmb ) , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion , @xmath27 , of a halo can be related to its mass through the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter , with @xmath30 and @xmath31^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the numerical constant was chosen so that , for an isothermal sphere of velocity - dispersion @xmath27 , the quantity @xmath14 is the mass enclosed within a sphere of average density @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the critical density at the corresponding redshift . on dimensional grounds , the ensemble - averaged mass accretion rate onto a halo of velocity dispersion @xmath27 can be written as ( white 1994 ) @xmath34 while the shock temperature and radius are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 the factors @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are dimensionless numbers of order unity , which depend only weakly on the background cosmology for the relevant range of @xmath40 , and should be calibrated based on numerical simulations ( see , e.g. miniati et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we have chosen the normalization in equation ( [ eq : r_sh ] ) so that for an isothermal sphere density distribution , the post shock density is @xmath41 , similar to the result for the self - similar accretion solution in an einstein de - sitter ( @xmath42 ) cosmology ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "note , that in this case the mass enclosed within @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field energy density is a fixed fraction of the post - shock energy density , @xmath45 with the above definitions , we find @xmath46^{1/2 } f_{\\rm sh}^{-1 } h_{70}^{4/3}a^{-2}[g(a)]^{4/3}m_{14}^{1/3}\\,\\mu{\\rm g } , \\label{eq : b}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for values of @xmath49 well below unity , we obtain a magnetic field amplitude consistent with observations ( kim et al . 1989 ; fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; rephaeli et al . 1999 ; kaastra et al .",
    "1999 ) and with our model for the @xmath0-ray background ( loeb & waxmann 2000 ) .",
    "the implied synchrotron luminosity is @xmath50^{2}~t_{\\rm kev}^{7/2}\\,~~{\\rm erg~s^{-1 } } , \\label{eq : l_syn_num}\\ ] ] which can be related to the cluster mass through equation ( [ eq : t ] ) , @xmath51^{-1}t_{\\rm kev}^{3/2 } , \\label{eq : t_num}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 . while @xmath0-ray observations can be used to calibrate @xmath53 ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) , radio synchrotron observations of clusters calibrate @xmath2 .",
    "the synchrotron luminosity predicted by equation ( [ eq : l_syn_num ] ) is consistent with the values observed for the brightest radio halos of unrelaxed x - ray clusters for @xmath54 ( see the upper envelope in fig .",
    "9 of liang et al .",
    "2000 , obtained for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "similarly to observations , our model predicts a radio luminosity which increases with cluster temperature and a nearly flat radio spectrum ( see fig . 6 in liang",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the above expressions apply only to clusters which possess a strong shock with a mach number @xmath57 .",
    "non - accreting clusters or low - mass clusters which accrete gas that was already pre - heated close to their virial temperature ( e.g. , due to prior collapse of their environment or because of supernova energy injection ) , will not show significant non - thermal emission . for a shock front moving at a moderate mach number ,",
    "the accelerated electrons acquire a number - energy distribution with a power - law index @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the shock compression ratio for a gas with an adiabatic index @xmath60 .",
    "this in turn yields steep non - thermal spectra with @xmath61}$ ] ; implying that for weak shocks with @xmath62 , most of the non - thermal emission is at undetectable low frequencies .",
    "the observed intensity at earth of inverse - compton and synchrotron emission is given by integrating ( [ eq : l_ic ] ) and ( [ eq : l_syn ] ) over halo mass and cosmic time , @xmath63 .",
    "thus , @xmath64 where angular brackets denote sky average and @xmath65 is the differential number density of halos per physical volume as a function of their mass . using the press - schechter ( 1974 ) mass function , we find for the cosmological parameters we have chosen , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , our model reproduces the @xmath0-ray background intensity for a reasonable choice of parameters , namely @xmath67 ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "given the calibration of the @xmath0-ray background we predict a radio background with @xmath68 we find that 90@xmath69 ( 50@xmath69 ) of the contribution to this background comes from massive clusters with @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , which are less sensitive to pre - heating of the accreting gas and for which the strong shock assumption is likely to apply .",
    "the intensity fluctuations can be calculated from @xmath72 ^ 2}{16\\pi^3(1+z)^8 r^2_{\\rm sh}(m , z ) } p_{1,2}\\left[{\\theta d_a(z)\\over r_{\\rm sh}(m , z)}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : di}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath73 is the sky average of the product of intensities along two lines of sight , 1 and 2 , separated by an angle @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath76 is the probability that line - of - sight 2 passes through a halo of radius @xmath77 given that line - of - sight 1 passes through the same halo , @xmath78 we have neglected in equation ( [ eq : di ] ) halo - halo correlations , and assumed that the only contribution to the integral is from both lines - of - sights passing through the same halo .",
    "this assumption is justified since the optical depth ( the average number of halos along a given line of sight ) is much smaller than unity for the typical parameter values . in particular",
    ", we find that clusters with @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) cover @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) of the sky .",
    "note that the fractional fluctuations , @xmath83 are independent of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath7 , and @xmath2 , and their dependence on @xmath84 is simply given by @xmath85_{f_{\\rm sh}=1}$ ] .",
    "the fluctuations in the radio and @xmath0-ray background intensities , derived from equation ( [ eq : di ] ) , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "although the synchrotron background amounts to only a small fraction of the cmb intensity , @xmath86 for @xmath87 , its fluctuations could dominate over the primordial cmb fluctuations at low photon frequencies , @xmath88  ghz .",
    "our results imply that radio emission from cluster shocks contributes a fluctuation amplitude between @xmath89 and @xmath90k @xmath91 to the cmb on angular scales between 1 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , current anisotropy experiments are just sensitive to this level of fluctuationsmax / index.html , or at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/@xmath93mwhite/cmbexptlist.html ] .",
    "existing detections by cat ( @xmath94k at 15  ghz on 0.20.5scales ) and ovro ( @xmath95k at 20  ghz on 0.10.6scales ) , as well as 95% upper limits ( @xmath96k on arcminute scales at 9 - 15 ghz by the atca , ryle and vla detectors ) are consistent with our prediction .    for bright clusters ,",
    "the flux increment due to synchrotron emission by the non - thermal electrons accelerated in the cluster accretion shock is larger at low frequencies than the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement due to the thermal intra - cluster electrons . for a gas density profile of an isothermal sphere , @xmath97^{11/3}m_{14}^{2/3}\\left({\\theta d_a\\over r_{\\rm sh}}\\right ) \\left({\\nu\\over { 10\\rm ghz}}\\right)^{-3}. \\label{eq : sz}\\ ] ] in the x - ray regime , the central surface brightness due to thermal bremsstrahlung emission by the intra - cluster gas exceeds by orders of magnitude the inverse - compton brightness ; however , due to the rapid decline of the thermal brightness with projected radius outside the cluster core ( @xmath98 ) , we find that the non - thermal brightness might dominate around the shock radius .",
    "the cumulative ( all sky ) number of radio and @xmath0-ray halos as a function of flux or surface - brightness thresholds are shown at the top and bottom panels of figure 2 .",
    "we find that @xmath89 @xmath0-ray halos have a flux exceeding the egret detection threshold of @xmath99 .",
    "such halos may therefore constitute , as recently pointed out by totani & kitayama ( 2000 ) , a significant fraction of the unidentified extra - galactic egret sources ( @xmath100 sources over all sky ; see zel & thompson 1996 ) .",
    "note , however , that since the angular extension of the brightest halos is large , a careful analysis is required to determine the detectability of such halos by the source search analysis which was applied to the egret data .",
    "the production of a fluctuating synchrotron background by strong intergalactic shocks is a natural consequence of structure formation in the universe .",
    "the brightest emission originates from the virialization shocks on mpc scales around newly formed , massive x - ray clusters .",
    "we estimate that the combined emission from all clusters produces fluctuations in the microwave background temperature of order @xmath101 on sub - degree scales ( fig .",
    "1 ) , where @xmath49 is the value required to explain the brightest radio halos of nearby clusters and @xmath5 accounts for the @xmath0-ray background . the foreground synchrotron fluctuations might be comparable to the anisotropy signals detected by existing low - frequency cmb experiments , and can be easily isolated through multi - frequency observations .",
    "polarization anisotropy experiments could then constrain the coherence length of the intergalactic magnetic field .",
    "our model predicts a fluctuation amplitude @xmath102 in the @xmath0-ray background intensity on sub - degree scale ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and the existence of extended , @xmath103 , @xmath0-ray halos , associated with newly formed massive clusters ( fig .",
    "2 ) . on scales larger than a degree",
    "the fluctuation amplitude declines and is well below the anisotropy limits from egret ( see fig . 5 in sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) , although somewhat higher than expected from an analogy to the x - ray background ( loeb & waxman 2000 ) .",
    "detection of the predicted signals will provide a calibration of the uncertain model parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the high - energy maps required to detect the predicted anisotropy signal will be made between 20 mev and 300 gev by the glast instrument ( planned for launch in 2005 ) , which is expected to be more sensitive than egret by an order - of - magnitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "the predicted @xmath0-ray halos may constitute a significant fraction of the unidentified extra - galactic egret sources ( see also totani & kitayama 2000 ) .",
    "however , since the angular extension of the brightest halos is large , a more careful analysis is required to assess the detectability of such halos by egret .",
    "a future , dedicated , all - sky anisotropy experiment , operating at several frequencies below 10 ghz , would be able to map the fluctuations in the intergalactic synchrotron background .",
    "the resulting synchrotron map could then be cross - correlated with full - sky maps at hard x - ray or @xmath0-ray energies to confirm its cosmic origin .",
    "identification of the synchrotron fluctuations together with their counterpart inverse - compton emission of hard x - rays or @xmath0-rays by the same population of shock - accelerated electrons , can be used to empirically determine the strength and spatial distribution of the intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "similarly , the correlation between radio and @xmath0-ray halos may be detectable around individual x - ray clusters .",
    "strong radio halos could be the best indicators for bright @xmath0-ray clusters , which would provide the first obvious targets for glast .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "our model associated the intergalactic shocks with smooth spherical accretion of gas onto clusters , while in reality they result from asymmetric mergers as well as from converging flows in large scale sheets and filaments .",
    "the more realistic emission from these complex geometries can be best modeled through detailed hydrodynamic simulations ( miniati et al .",
    "2000 ; keshet et al .",
    "however , we note that mergers of comparable mass clusters would tend to produce only mild shocks due to the prior heating of the shocked gas , and hence result in negligible non - thermal emission due to the steep power - law slope of the accelerated electrons .",
