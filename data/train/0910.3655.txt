    "stellar explosions , broadly refered to as supernovae ( sne ) , are understood to stem from a sudden release of energy either associated with the collapse of the degenerate core of a massive star or from the thermonuclear combustion of fresh fuel deep inside the stellar envelope . whether one or the other mechanism occurs seems to depend on the main - sequence mass of the progenitor star , with core collapse occuring systematically if its value is above @xmath78 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter whw02 ) .",
    "whatever the mechanism , the typical kinetic energy of sn ejecta is on the order of 10@xmath8erg , as inferred for example for the well - studied sn 1987a ( type ii peculiar ; @xcite ) , for sn 1999em ( type ii - plateau , heareafter ii - p ; @xcite ) , or for the very uniform set of events that type ia sne constitutes @xcite .",
    "the cause of this apparent degeneracy in explosion energy is , paradoxically , perhaps not so much tied to the mechanism itself , but instead to the rather uniform total envelope binding energy of the progenitor stars , on the order of 10@xmath8erg ; anything falling short of that leads to a fizzle and no sn display .",
    "the last decade of observations of such transient phenomena has shown , however , that the radiative signatures associated with sne ( as classified in circulars ) are very diverse , from very faint to very luminous , from fast - evolving to slow - evolving or fast - expanding to slow - expanding .",
    "this diversity has been observed little in type ia sne , with a few peculiar events such as sn 2002ic ( presence of narrow hydrogen lines in an otherwise standard type ia spectrum ; @xcite ) or snls-03d3bb ( possible type ia sn from a super - chandrasekhar white dwarf star ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , there has been a rich diversity in explosions associated ( perhaps erroneously at times ) with massive stars and the mechanism of core collapse . we have observed 1 ) type ic sne , associated or not with a long - soft @xmath9-ray burst , and with a standard or a very large kinetic energy ( sn 1998bw , @xcite ; sn 2002ap , @xcite ) ; 2 ) a large population of type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sne in what seems to be the generic explosion of a moderate - mass red - supergiant ( rsg ) star ( e.g. sn 2005cs , @xcite ) ; 3 ) a growing number of low - luminosity sne that share properties with standard type ii - p sne except for being significantly and globally less energetic ( e.g. sn1997d , @xcite ; sn 1999br , @xcite ; ot2006 - 1 in m85 , whose status is ambiguous , see @xcite ) .",
    "we show a sample of @xmath10-band absolute - magnitude light curves of such core - collapse sne in fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_lc ] , with representative peak values of @xmath1114 to @xmath1117mag and a 100-day plateau duration ( best seen in the right panel of that figure ) , hence about 6 - 10mag brighter than their proposed rsg progenitors ( shown as black crosses ) . from this expanded sn sample ,",
    "the range of corresponding explosion energies has considerably widened , extending above and below the standard 10@xmath8erg value . within the core - collapse sn context",
    ", this modulation is thought to stem from modulations in the energy revival of the stalled shock above the nascent proto - neutron star , in turn modulated by the stellar - core structure @xcite .",
    "the stretching to low explosion energies of potential core - collapse sn events is intriguing . for the most energetic explosions belonging to points 1 and 2 above",
    ", the classification as a sn is unambiguous .",
    "however , some transient events show an ejecta / outflow kinetic energy and a peak magnitude that are sn - like , although the events did not stem from core collapse ( a star is observed at that location on post - explosion / eruption images ) ; the community calls these sn impostors ( e.g. sn1997bs ; fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_lc ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , this raises the issue whether _ low - energy _ type ii - p sne are associated with core collapse - they might but they need not .",
    "we illustrate this overlap in radiative properties for a sample of such objects in fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_lc ] .",
    "one such case is the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) @xmath12 car , whose properties during its 1843 eruption rival those of the low - luminosity type ii - p sn1999br .",
    "@xmath12 car survived this gigantic eruption , which shed about 10 of material in what now constitutes the homunculus nebula @xcite .",
    "in contrast to core - collapse sne , such eruptive phenomena in massive stars have been associated with the proximity of the star to the eddington luminosity @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the mass absorption coefficient ) . due to the steep dependence of luminosity to mass ( e.g. with an exponent of 3.5 for main - sequence objects ) , this limit is easily reached by very massive stars such as @xmath12 car , or more generally massive blue - supergiant stars . in this context",
    ", massive stars are thought to undergo considerable mass loss when their luminosity overcomes the eddington limit , giving rise to a porosity - modulated continuum - driven outflow @xcite . here",
    ", this super - eddington wind constitutes a quasi steady - state outflow , and has therefore been thought to be of a fundamentally different nature from core - collapse sn ejecta . and indeed , one refers to a wind for the former and to an ejecta for the later .",
    "this dichotomy has been exacerbated by the stark contrast in typical light curves of eruptive stars ( long lived with large brightness ) and core - collapse sn explosions ( short lived with huge brightness ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_lc ] , we show two known eruptive massive stars that highlight this contrast .",
    "however , recent observations may be challenging such a strict segregation .",
    "first , the recent identification of very fast outflowing material ahead of @xmath12 car s homunculus now suggests that such material was accelerated by a shock , rather than driven in a quasi - steady wind , and thus connects the giant outburst to an explosive origin @xcite .",
    "second , the existence of interacting sne tells us that a massive eruption can occur merely a few years before explosion .",
    "for some , e.g. sn 2006gy @xcite or sn 1994w @xcite , the amount is thought to be large enough to decelerate the energetic ( and necessarily faster - expanding ) subsequent ejection .",
    "this very strict timing of merely a few years , _ which is orders of magnitude smaller than evolutionary or transport time - scales _ , suggests a connection between the mechanisms at the origin of the two ejections . for sn2006gy ,",
    "woosley et al .",
    "propose recurrent pair - instability pulsations , a mechanism germane to super - massive stars and therefore extremely rare .",
    "for lower mass massive stars , this short delay of a few years seems to exclude a very - long , secular , evolution for the production of the first ejection since this would have no natural timing to the comparatively instantaneous event of core collapse .",
    "motivated by these recent observations , we explore in this paper whether this diversity of events could be reproduced by a unique and deeply - rooted mechanism , associated with the sudden energy release above the stellar core and the subsequent shock heating of the progenitor envelope .",
    "this means would communicate a large energy to the stellar envelope on a shock crossing time - scale of days rather than on a very long - diffusion time - scale of thousands of years or more .",
    "although different in their origin , this energy release could be a weak analogue of what results in pair - instability pulsations , i.e. a nuclear flash , as identified in the 8 - 12 range by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", following this shock - heating hypothesis , we use 1d radiation - hydrodynamics simulations to explore the production of explosions / eruptions in stars more massive that @xmath710 on the main sequence . rather than focusing on specific models , like those potentially associated with failed supernovae @xcite , we parameterize the problem through a simple energy deposition , taking place with a given magnitude , over a given time , and at a given depth in a set of pre - sn progenitor star models .",
    "we do not aim at reproducing any specific observation but , through a systematic approach , try to identify important trends , in a spirit similar to that of @xcite . however , we depart from these authors by studying `` non - standard '' explosions . in practice , we consider cases where the energy deposited can be both smaller or larger than the binding energy of the overlying envelope , but must imperatively be released on a very short time - scale to trigger the formation of a shock . doing so , we identify three regimes , with `` standard '' sn explosions ( short - lived transients ) at the high energy end , objects that we will group in the category sn `` impostors '' ( long - lived transients ) at intermediate energy , and variable stars at the very low energy end .",
    "let us stress here that we do not make the claim that all massive - star eruptions , or all transients in general , stem from a strong , sudden , and deeply - rooted energy release in their envelope . here , we make this our working hypothesis and investigate how much such an explosive scenario can explain observations",
    "we do find that this scenario has great potential and should be considered as a possibility when examining the origin of massive - star eruptions and associated transient phenomena .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sect_input ] , we briefly present the stellar evolutionary models of whw02 that we use as input for our 1d 1-group radiation - hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "we discuss the properties of the progenitor massive stars of whw02 , such as density structure and binding energy , that are relevant for the present study .",
    "we then describe in ",
    "[ sect_model ] , the numerical technique and setup for our energy deposition study . in  [ sect_s11 ]",
    ", we present the results of a sequence of simulations based primarily on the 11 model of whw02 , discussing the properties of the shocked progenitor envelope for different values of the strength (  [ var_edep ] ) , the depth (  [ var_mcut ] ) and the duration (  [ var_dt ] ) of the energy deposition .",
    "we also discuss in  [ var_mprog ] the results obtained for more massive pre - sn progenitors , ranging from 15 to 25 on the main sequence . in  [ sect_rad ] , we present synthetic spectra computed separately with cmfgen @xcite for a few models at a representative time after shock breakout . in  [ sect_discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our results for understanding transient phenomena , and in  [ sect_conclusion ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the energy - deposition study presented here starts off from the stellar evolutionary calculations of whw02 , who provide a set of pre - sn massive stars , objects evolved all the way from the main sequence until the onset of core collapse .",
    "we refer the reader to whw02 for a discussion of the physics included in such models .",
    "these physically - consistent models give envelope structures that obey the equations and principles of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the exact details of these models are not relevant since we aim at developing a general , qualitative , understanding of stellar envelope behaviour in response to shock - heating - we do not aim at connecting a specific observation to a specific input . here , we focus on 10 - 40 progenitor stars evolved at solar metallicity and in the absence of rotation .",
    "these calculations include the effect of radiation - driven mass loss through a treatment of the outer - boundary mass - flux , so that the final mass in this set reaches a maximum of @xmath715 for a @xmath720 progenitor star .",
    "mass loss leads also to a considerable size reduction of the stellar envelope , with partial or complete loss of the hydrogen rich layers , producing smaller objects at core collapse for main - sequence masses above @xmath730 . in the sequence of pre - sn models of whw02 , surface radii vary from 410@xmath15 cm in the 10 - 30 range , decreasing to @xmath16 cm in the 30 - 40 range .",
    "this set of models is not exhaustive .",
    "all our input stellar - evolutionary models have reached the end of a massive - star life and all have a degenerate core that collapses .",
    "they are thus not exactly suited for post - main sequence massive stars that may be burning hydrogen / helium in the core / shell .",
    "the sampled mass range does not stretch to the most massive stars known , which also happen to exhibit variability and eruptions .",
    "in particular , it does not include massive blue supergiants , which are connected observationally with eruptive phenomena .",
    "it does not include highly - massive stars close to the eddington limit , nor objects that for some reason would be near critical rotation .",
    "it does not include any object resulting from close binary evolution .",
    "these are clear limitations for an association of transient phenomena with specific progenitors , but this is not the goal of this study .",
    "observations have likely been biased toward the most massive stars undergoing massive ejections , missing fainter progenitors undergoing more modest eruptions . circumventing specific issues linking tightly specific models to specific observations",
    ", we attempt instead to develop a qualitative understanding .",
    "our study is thus conceptual and explores the behavior of a gravitationally - bound envelope subject to shock - heating .",
    "as we explain below , the present set covers a wide enough range of properties to reveal important systematics in this context , which can then be applied more generally to other stars , be they of larger mass etc .",
    "the density distribution above the iron core is an important property that distinguishes the structure of massive stars .",
    "low - mass massive stars show a steep density fall - off above their degenerate core , while the more massive stars boast very flat density profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_mr ] ; recall that at the time shown , the fe or onemg core is degenerate and starts to collapse ) . in the context of core - collapse sn explosions , this has been recognized as one of the key aspect of the problem , since this density profile directly connects to the mass - accretion rate onto the proto - neutron star in the critical first second that follows core bounce @xcite .",
    "this has led @xcite , and more recently @xcite to identify a criterion for explosion through a competition between neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate .",
    "such a criterion , although tuned by the global hydrostatic configuration of the progenitor star , isolates the conditions for a successful explosion to those in the direct vicinity of the pre - collapsed core .",
    "a more global , and more fundamentally meaningful , criterion for a successful explosion is whether the energy deposited at the base of the progenitor envelope is smaller or greater than its binding energy .",
    "this matter is rarely addressed explicitly , supposedly because the 10@xmath8erg explosion energy aimed for is thought to be much in excess of the binding energy of the envelope , but this may in fact not be the case and it is ignoring the key role the binding energy plays in producing the diversity of characters observed in core - collapse sne , and potentially in numerous transients .      the variation in the progenitor envelope density structure ( fig .  [ fig_rho_mr ] ) is echoed in the corresponding binding energy of the stellar envelope . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_eb_mr ] , we show the binding energy of the envelope exterior to a lagrangian - mass coordinate @xmath17 , as a function of @xmath17 , for the same set of pre - sn massive star models . to differentiate mass shells of different compositions ,",
    "we use symbols to mark the inner edge of the hydrogen shell ( diamond ) , of the he - rich shell ( triangle ) , and of the o - rich shell ( dot ) .",
    "the binding energy shows a strong dependency with progenitor main - sequence mass , and we can identify two classes of objects . objects with main - sequence mass below @xmath725 possess a sizable hydrogen envelope , whose fraction of the total mass at the onset of collapse grows as we go to lower - mass progenitors .",
    "it represents at collapse @xmath780% of the total mass in the 11 model , but only @xmath730% in the 25 model ( these masses refer to the main - sequence mass ) . in all these cases ,",
    "whenever present , the binding energy of the hydrogen shell is very small , on the order of 10@xmath18erg , hence very loosely bound to the star .",
    "in contrast , for objects with main - sequence masses in excess of 25 - 30 , the hydrogen envelope is shed through mass loss during the pre - sn evolution , and the pre - sn star is essentially a `` compact '' star , with an envelope whose binding energy is now 3 - 4 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "this is perhaps the single - most important characteristics of pre - sn massive star envelopes resulting from the single - star evolution calculations of whw02 , namely that hydrogen - deficient ( generally higher - mass originally ) stars are very tightly - bound objects while hydrogen - rich ( generally lower - mass originally ) stars are very loosely bound .    moving deeper into the envelope , i.e. in the he or o shells",
    ", the same trend persists , with a systematic increase in binding energy for each shell edge as we move up in mass from low - mass to high - mass massive stars . as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_eb_mr ] , the binding energy of the entire envelope exterior to the degenerate core varies from @xmath1910@xmath20erg for the 11 model ( a rsg star with a final mass of @xmath710.6 ) up to @xmath710@xmath8erg in the 40 ( a h - deficient wolf - rayet star with a final mass of @xmath78 ) model .    for an explosion to ensue , an energy greater than the binding energy must be deposited suddenly at the base of the envelope , the excess energy above the binding energy being used to accelerate the envelope and turn it into outflow / ejecta . while a very modest energy of @xmath710@xmath20erg is sufficient to unbind the envelope of a 10 rsg star , such a deposition in a wolf - rayet star would produce nothing remarkable . in the present work ,",
    "the connection between energy deposition and binding energy is key to the understanding of the properties of the resulting mass ejections .",
    "more generally , the low binding energy of massive star envelopes is of primary importance for the understanding of their stability / variability , as in the context of pulsations , for example .",
    "the origin of the energy deposition that we artificially treat in this work may be a sequel of the gravitational collapse of the core , in which case it can happen only once , leading either to an explosion or to a fizzle .",
    "alternative sources in massive stars will likely be less energetic , but in objects with low binding energy , may still be of relevance to a wide spectrum of astrophysical events .",
    "the most suited mechanism in the present context would be the prompt thermonuclear combustion of a small amount of material . in the context of very massive stars like @xmath12 car",
    "( not directly addressed through our progenitor set ) , @xcite propose that non - radial gravity mode oscillations could lead to mixing into the hydrogen - shell burning layer of fresh fuel located directly above it , thereby releasing suddenly a large amount of energy to unbind a fraction of the above layers . in lower mass massive stars at the end of their lives , this combustion could concern already processed material , like carbon , oxygen , or silicon , at a location just above the degenerate core .",
    "such `` nuclear flashes '' have indeed been encountered in stellar - evolutionary calculations of 8 - 12 massive stars @xcite .",
    "interestingly , with a ( nuclear ) binding energy of @xmath71mev / nucleon , the combustion of @xmath21c or @xmath22o to @xmath23fe liberates @xmath24)erg .",
    "hence , as little as a few percent of a solar mass of carbon or oxygen burnt to iron can yield an energy in excess of the binding energy of the lowest - mass massive stars , and of comparable magnitude to that of the weakest core - collapse sn explosions @xcite or lbvs .      in radiative stellar envelopes ,",
    "energy is transported outward by diffusion .",
    "any increase in energy release from the core provokes a steepening of the temperature profile and an enhanced radiative flux , carrying outward this extra energy , often aided by convection too .",
    "however , radiative diffusion or convection can only be effective for small increases in energy , due to the short mean - free path of photons and/or the modest sound speed . associated time - scales for such energy transport are therefore long and the means poorly efficient . in fig .",
    "[ fig_tdiff_mr ] , we show the diffusion time as a function of depth in the 10 - 40 model sequence of whw02 , computed by adopting a constant mass - absorption coefficient of 0.1@xmath25g@xmath26 ( intermediate between that for the hydrogen - rich and silicon - rich shells ) but a depth - dependent mean - free - path ( * ? ? ? * this is controlled primarily by the twenty - order - of - magnitude variation in density between the core and the surface ) .",
    "resulting diffusion times from regions immediately above the core range from 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath2 years .",
    "in contrast , the shock crossing time - scale of the envelope is @xmath28/@xmath29 , which for wolf - rayet to rsg progenitor stars with radii of 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath30 cm and even modest , but supersonic , shock waves with @xmath311000 , is typically on the order of minutes to days .    in this study , we want to explore what happens when the deposition of energy leads to an energy increase that can not be remedied either by diffusion or convection transport , but instead has to lead to shock formation ( even for small energy deposition ) .",
    "this leads to a completely different regime since in this situation the shock can communicate this extra energy to the _ entire _ envelope on a short time - scale of days : the stellar envelope hence responds immediately to the change of conditions at depth , instead of secularly evolving to a bigger / smaller or cooler / hotter star .",
    "this dichotomy was recently discussed in the context of the helium flash , whose associated energy was found to be too small to lead to the formation of a shock @xcite . in our artificial approach",
    ", the energy release has to occur on a very short time - scale to trigger the formation of a shock .",
    "how short will depend on the progenitor since , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eint_mr ] , the depth - dependent internal energy ( including both radiation and thermal components ) varies considerably between progenitors , increasing at a given @xmath17 with main - sequence mass .",
    "forming a shock will require a stronger energy deposition , a shorter deposition time , and/or a more exterior deposition site in higher mass progenitors .      in the present study on pre - sn massive - star progenitors , we find that an energy deposition that is marginally larger than the envelope binding energy yields ejecta that are reminiscent of sn impostors , but in the present context , are also reminiscent of the mass ejections that must take place prior to core collapse in interacting sne .",
    "the short delay between the two ejections , of no more than a few years to produce a luminous interacting sn , suggests a shock - heating solution for both ejections .",
    "any other energy - transport means in a massive star that could propel mass out of the gravitational potential would take place on a time - scale of thousands of years or more .",
    "the disconnection between the surface and the core thus suggests that both events are tied to a phenomenon that happens in the core or in its direct vicinity .",
    "we propose thermonuclear flashes associated with shell burning in the last stages of massive star evolution ( pair - instability pulsations are analogous to this scenario but may only apply to stars with a main - sequence mass in the range 95130 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these burning stages are very short ( month to year time - scales ) and always occur at the end of the life of all massive stars .",
    "they offer a natural tuning and a reproducible circumstance for the production of interacting sne , with at least one major interaction between the penultimate shell ejection and that resulting from the gravitational collapse of the degenerate core . given the relatively large number of interacting sne compared to the strict time requirements to produce them ( a few - year delay is no more than an instant relative to the lifetime of a star ! ) suggests that indeed the conditions must be met often rather than encountered by chance .",
    "the stellar - evolutionary calculations of @xcite for 8 - 12 massive stars support the occurrence of nuclear flashes in association with ne and si core / shell burning , and occuring merely a few years prior to core collapse .",
    "these simulations are old and would need to be revisited in a thorough fashion , with full hydrodynamics , multi - dimensionality , and high resolution .    in the context of more massive stars like @xmath12 car , @xcite",
    "propose that non - radial gravity mode oscillations above the core and near the hydrogen - burning shell could lead to mixing of hydrogen - rich material downward into hotter denser layers .",
    "combustion of this fresh fuel would yield a burst of energy triggering mass ejection and a bolometric brightening . in this work ,",
    "we emphasize the dire consequences of any such energy release on loosely - bound massive stars , potentially triggering single eruptions as evidenced in transients or multiple eruptions as evidenced in interacting sne @xcite .",
    "more generally , the hydrodynamical investigations of the late stages of nuclear burning in massive stars by @xcite reveal the multi - dimensional and time - dependent nature of the problem , issues that have been largely overlooked in stellar evolutionary calculations so far .",
    "in particular , they find that considerable energy can leak out of the convectively - burning shells in the form of waves , with a potential to alter the otherwise quasi - steady hydrostatic configuration of the stellar envelope .",
    "similar investigations for lower - mass massive stars are highly needed .",
    "these works provide a physical motivation for our investigations . for the simulations presented here",
    ", we do not , however , build a fully - consistent picture of the problem , but instead start off by imposing the modalities of such an energy deposition . in practice",
    ", we follow a very simple approach , adopting a constant energy - deposition rate for a given duration .",
    "we thus neglect any feedback of the dynamics on the mechanism causing the energy release .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this work were all performed with vulcan/1d ( v1d ) , a one dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics code that works in the framework of newtonian physics .",
    "it incorporates many methods and techniques , using both lagrangian and eulerian schemes for planar , cylindrical , and spherical geometries .",

    "those however were not implemented in this work .",

    "albeit weak , such an energy deposition causes a significant translation of the star in the hr diagram and may be linked , in some cases , to the photometric and spectroscopic variability of h - rich massive stars .",
    "the central element that enables such low - energy perturbations to have any effect is the very low binding energy of massive star envelopes , in particular at the low - mass end .",
    "we have argued in the introduction and in  [ sect_input ] that , physically , a deposition of energy from deep regions in the progenitor star is more likely since this is where most of the energy is stored or can be made available .",
    "this can occur through gravitational collapse of the degenerate core from its original radius of a few 1000 km to @xmath710 km ( the standard initiation of a core - collapse sn explosion ) , or from violent shell burning above the core ( our preferred trigger for transient phenomena in massive stars ) .",
    "in contrast , the envelope layers well above the core , characterized by lower densities and temperatures , tend to merely react to energy changes occurring at depth .",
    "it is , however , interesting to investigate the dependency of our results on the adopted site of energy deposition .",
    "we have thus performed two sequences for @xmath38erg ( model s11_1 ) and @xmath39erg ( model s11_3 ) , with a deposition at 1.8 ( as before ) , 3 , 7 , and 9 lagrangian mass coordinate .",
    "these correspond to locations in the helium or in the hydrogen shell .",
    "the deposition time in all cases is 10s .",
    "we show the resulting light curves for both sequences in fig .",

    "the s11_1 model sequence ( black curve , left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_s11_wmin_phot_lum ] ) , the energy deposition is on the order of the binding energy of the _ entire _ envelope above the 1.8 mass cut . as we discussed before , this led to a sn - impostor - like event , with only a fraction of the total envelope ejected to infinity .",
    "the envelope outside of a 3 mass cut has , however , only a 10@xmath18erg binding energy so , as we move outward the site of energy deposition ( from 3 , to 7 , and 9 lagrangian mass coordinate ) , we switch to a successful explosion with sizable kinetic energy and rapid light - curve evolution . as given in table  [ tab_s11_wcomp ] , the models with a mass cut at and beyond 3 lead to full ejection of the layers exterior to the energy - deposition site , with representative ejecta expansion rates of 400800and kinetic energy of 10@xmath20erg .",
    "interestingly , the phase of high - brightness lasts from 90 up to 180 days despite the low amount of ejected material , i.e. between 1.6 and 7.6 .",
    "the long duration of these events , even for low ejected masses , is caused by two factors .",
    "first , the expansion is relatively slow so that radiative diffusion is modestly facilitated by the ejecta density reduction with time ( we are closer to a static regime of radiative diffusion ) .",
    "second , the energy losses through expansion are minimal since we start from a very extended ( i.e. loosely - bound ) stellar envelope .",
    "note here that in the more compact ( i.e. tightly - bound ) progenitor configurations for type i sne ( wolf - rayet stars or white dwarfs ) , the cooling through expansion is tremendous and the events owe their large brightness at a few weeks after explosion entirely to the heating caused by unstable isotopes with week - long half - lifes . _ a corollary is that weak - energy ejections with little @xmath23ni can only reach a large luminosity if they arise from a loosely - bound initial configuration , e.g. a big star . _    for the s11_3 model sequence ( light curve shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_s11_wmin_phot_lum ] ) , the energy deposition is greater than the binding energy of the envelope above the 1.8 mass cut so that no matter what the position of the mass cut is outside of 1.8 , we obtain full ejection of the shocked layers , with representative velocities in the range 500 - 1600 .    to conclude , we find that moving the energy - deposition mass cut @xmath40 outwards for a given energy - deposition magnitude @xmath0 produces a similar effect to increasing @xmath0 at a given @xmath40 .",
    "quantitatively , this is modulated by the binding energy of the envelope exterior to @xmath40 .",
    "we observe in particular that with such rsg progenitors it is possible to obtain light curves with a very extended plateau even for very small ejecta mass .",
    "note that this remains an experiment though , since we believe the energy deposition in a massive star must occur in the vicinity of the core , hence interior to the helium shell of pre - sn massive stars .",
    "a fundamental element of our study is that energy deposition must occur on a short time - scale to ensure the formation of a shock , rather than on a long time - scale which would allow radiative diffusion and convection to carry outward the extra energy . in this section ,",
    "we present results with v1d for a model with @xmath41erg and @xmath42 , but an energy - deposition time of 10 seconds , one hour , one day , one week , and one month .",
    "since the resulting ejecta and bolometric properties are similar to those of the model s11_3_w3 ( see table  [ tab_s11_wcomp ] ) , we do not tabulate the results for this sequence of models .",
    "however , we show the synthetic light curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_var_dt ] . in all cases ,",
    "a phase of shock breakout takes place , followed by a bright plateau that persists over a similar duration .",
    "no qualitative difference is visible , and quantitative differences are small .    hence , shock formation persists even for very long deposition times , despite the large range covered . in other words ,",
    "a deposition of energy that takes place over a time - scale much longer than the expected shock revival time in core - collapse sn explosion ( i.e. one second ) still leads to shock formation .",
    "we are aware that the neglect of feedback effects makes this exploration somewhat artificial .",
    "in the context of a nuclear flash , expansion could , for example , endanger the continuation of nuclear burning .    for energy - deposition time - scales much longer than a month ,",
    "a diffusion wave , rather than a shock , would form , together perhaps with convection .",
    "such a regime , not of interest in the present study , would have to be followed in 2d or 3d ( see , for example , @xcite ) to properly model the interplay between these two means of energy transport and the resulting effects on the envelope structure .",
    "the choice of the 11 model for the investigations presented so far was motivated by the lower density of the progenitor envelope .",
    "this produces larger courant - time increments for the hydrodynamics and easier computing .",
    "however , as evidenced by the variation in envelope binding energy for 10 - 40 massive stars ( recall that these model masses correspond to those on the main sequence ; the corresponding masses at the onset of collapse can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_mr ] ) and by the dependencies presented in the previous sections , a given energy deposition will obviously produce a very different outcome for different progenitor masses . in this section ,",
    "we thus explore the radiative and dynamical properties of ejecta produced by the deposition of 10@xmath43erg at the base of the helium shell in 11 , 15 , 20 , and 25 massive - star progenitors . in the same order",
    ", this corresponds to mass cuts at 1.8 , 3.1 , 5.0 , and 7.2 in the envelope , to envelope binding energies ( we quote absolute values ) of 9.9@xmath32erg , 4.6@xmath44erg , 6.6@xmath44erg , and 1.4@xmath45erg , and to total progenitor masses at the time of collapse of 10.6 , 12.6 , 14.7 , and 12.5 .",
    "we show the resulting light curves in fig .",

    "note that if , using the same progenitors ( 11 , 15 , 20 , and 25 main - sequence mass models ) , we deposit a given energy at a radius where the lagrangian mass is 2 lower than the total progenitor mass ( same shell mass underneath the progenitor surface ) , we obtain essentially the same light curves and ejecta properties for all models",
    ". this degeneracy results from the generic @xmath710@xmath18erg binding energy of the corresponding ( outer ) h - rich shell in these different stars .    to summarize , and perhaps paradoxically , the consideration of these additional progenitors ( with different envelope structure / binding energy ) does not add any new perspective to our results so far since the diversity of outcomes was fully revealed earlier on with the 11 model through the variation of the values of @xmath0 and @xmath40 .",
    "our sample of progenitor models does not include more massive stars .",
    "such models were not added to retain a homogeneous sample , focus on conceptual aspects ( i.e. shock heating of a representative gravitationally - bound stellar envelope ) and leave aside the specificities of the numerous different categories of stars undergoing eruptions .",
    "one such category is that of blue - supergiant stars in the phase of hydrogen / helium core / shell burning .",
    "these objects are found at moderate masses , covered by our sample , but also extend to much larger masses .",
    "for example , the stars associated with events as diverse as sn1987a and the erupting @xmath12 car are bsgs , with associated masses in the range 15 - 20  and @xmath7100 .",
    "however , compared to our sample of rsg stars , these objects are all more tightly bound , as reflected by their smaller surface radii of at most a hundred rather than a thousand times that of the sun . hence , the various regimes highlighted above would apply with all energies scaled upwards .",
    "the duration of the transient would depend on the amount of material ejected , reflecting the dependencies discussed in ",
    "[ var_mcut ] .",
    "because of their larger binding energy , very low - energy transient resulting from the mechanism presented here would be less likely to occur in such objects . for the most massive objects , the proximity to the eddington limit will considerably reduce the binding energy of the envelope and will make it more prone to eruptions if perturbed by a deep - seated energy source . to provide more quantitative results and comparison with observations , we will present in a forthcoming study the gas and radiation properties we predict for very massive post main - sequence stars subject to shock heating .",
    "in this section , we provide synthetic spectra that illustrate the spectral - energy distribution of the various models discussed above .",
    "we choose the representative time of five days after shock breakout since it is a typical discovery time for sne , and perhaps as well for optical transients etc .",
    "this also offers a unique reference time for comparison in all models .",
    "we focus on the models presented in  [ var_edep ]",
    "in which only the energy deposition magnitude is varied , using the 11 model and adopting a deposition site at the 1.8 lagrangian - mass coordinate .",
    "the computation we perform follows the approach described in various contexts in @xcite . using the results from our v1d computations , we extract the gas properties at a total optical depth of a few tens and at a time of about five days after shock breakout .",
    "we then use these characteristics of radius , density , temperature , and velocity ( see fig .  [ fig_s11_phot ] ) to setup the initial conditions for the non - lte radiative - transfer calculation . at such early times",
    ", the photosphere resides in the outer hydrogen - rich part of the progenitor envelope , characterized by a typical rsg surface composition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a density exponent of ten and a homologous expansion .",
    "recall that the line and continuum formation regions are rather confined and hence such characteristics , in practice , really matter _ locally _ , i.e. the density / velocity distributions may vary differently in a global sense ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_v1d_sed ] the synthetic spectra ( i.e. the emergent flux in the observer s frame ) , assuming a distance of 10mpc and neglecting any reddening .    at that reference time , and from the high to the low energy - deposition case , we obtain a trend towards smaller ejecta velocity ( narrower line profiles ) , smaller temperature ( redder peak flux distribution ) , combined with a smaller radius ( smaller flux ) . at higher energy deposition ,",
    "the synthetic spectra are reminiscent of type ii - p sne ( from standard to low - luminosity ones ) , while for lower energy deposition , the spectra are qualitatively similar to those of cool mass - losing stars like the present day @xmath12 car or sn impostors , e.g. 1961 @xcite , 1997bs @xcite , 2000ch @xcite , or 2002 kg @xcite .",
    "we thus recover spectroscopically the various regimes identified in bolometric light curves and ejecta properties , primarily through modulations in luminosity and line width .",
    "an interesting aspect of this set of simulations is that for h - rich massive stars ( and as long as the temperatures are not too low to foster the formation of molecules and dust ) , we obtain a very uniform set of spectral features ( with the dominance of hydrogen and metals , whose abundance is that of the environment in which the star was born ) , merely varying in widths , with slight changes in the flux distribution mostly associated with variations in ionization .",
    "for example , the lbv @xmath12 car has the same surface composition as the progenitor of sn 1999em @xcite ; it also has similar line - profile morphology and flux distribution as that of the interacting sn 1994w @xcite .",
    "this spectroscopic degeneracy / uniformity adds to the difficulty of inferring the dynamical origin of the event .",
    "in this section , we discuss the ramifications of our results for explosions and eruptions in massive stars .",
    "let us stress again that we do not make the claim that all massive - star mass ejections , or all transients in general , stem from a strong , sudden , and deeply - rooted energy release in the progenitor - star envelope .",
    "but here , given this working hypothesis , we explore its potential for explaining the properties and the diversity of observed transient phenomena associated with massive stars .",
    "the binding energy is the most fundamental quantity controlling the outcome of a given energy deposition .",
    "although this conclusion seems trivial , its implications are far - reaching .",
    "since the binding energy of massive stars increases with progenitor mass , sn explosions arising from more massive progenitors will , on average , be more energetic .",
    "indeed , the energy deposition at the base of the envelope to be ejected has to be a few units of the binding energy , one unit to unbind the envelope , and the remaining units to give it its kinetic energy ( fast expansion ) and internal energy ( bright display ) . in the sample of massive stars studied here , the envelope binding energy ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_eb_mr ] ) sets a higher energy threshold for increasing progenitor main - sequence mass .",
    "consequently , stars originally more massive than @xmath715 require an energy deposition of at least 10@xmath8erg to unbind the envelope while 100 times less is sufficient in a 10 progenitor .",
    "a corollary is that quite generally , low - energy explosions in gravitationally - bound objects are more likely to be associated with loosley - bound objects .",
    "this appears counter intuitive since one may argue that the ejecta kinetic energy at infinity should be anything from zero ( @xmath46 ) up to arbitrary large values ( set by @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is true in theory , but in practice , the range of energies for events classified as a sn or as a low - energy transient differs , and vary greatly with the progenitor binding energy . at present",
    ", we have no reason to believe that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are exactly tuned in any way .",
    "this holds very obviously in the context of the core - collapse sn explosion mechanism where the conditions for a successful explosion are set by what happens in the vicinity of the core and thus entirely disconnected from the _ global _ threshold set by the envelope binding energy .",
    "so , we can assume that @xmath0 is _ uniformly _ distributed ( the number of events having an energy between @xmath0 and @xmath48 scales linearly with the energy bin @xmath49 but is independent of @xmath0 ) , with values above and below the envelope - binding energy .",
    "now , mass ejection will only occur if @xmath50 .",
    "consider an object with a binding energy of 10@xmath8erg , and focus on the _ uniform _ distribution of events with an energy deposition between 10@xmath8erg and 2@xmath3610@xmath8erg ( we ignore those events that lead to no eruption and limit the maximum energy to that for a typical sn ejecta , e.g. for sn1987a ) .",
    "we can say that all ejecta with a kinetic energy in the range 10@xmath43erg up to 10@xmath8erg represent powerful explosions and will tend to be viewed / classified as a sn : this represents 90% of the events in our distribution .",
    "ejecta with an ( asymptotic ) kinetic energy less than 10@xmath43erg will be produced with a 10% probability , those with less than 10@xmath20erg with a 1% probability , and those with less than 10@xmath37erg with a 0.1% probability .",
    "this does not mean that a low - energy transient can not take place in a highly bound object , but it strongly suggests that unless there is a mechanism that biases the energy deposition to match the binding energy ( all sn explosions strongly support the contrary ! ) , low - energy ejecta are _ statistically more likely _ to occur in loosely - bound objects . another way to consider",
    "this is that to produce a low - energy transient in a highly - bound object , the excess energy to deposit is so small compared to the binding energy of the envelope that the required tuning to make this low - energy ejection can hardly be met .",
    "hence , low - energy transients associated with stars should stem from ejection of loosely - bound regions , for example the envelope of low - mass massive stars or , in another context , low - mass shells at the surface of a white dwarf .",
    "obviously , this is relevant only if any such energy deposition can take place but observations of transients demonstrate that it can . how it does it is a question left for future work .",
    "as more and more energy is needed to eject the envelopes of more massive progenitors , the extreme case of tightly bound wolf - rayet stars can only be associated with very energetic explosions .",
    "the fact that ( nearly ) all hypernovae are associated with type ib / c sne is in this respect quite compelling .",
    "it is not so much that they somehow can achieve higher energy deposition ; it is that they _ must _ ( the fact that they do achieve a higher energy - deposition to explode is an interesting problem that concerns the explosion mechanism , neutrino physics , magneto - rotational effects etc ) . in other words , of all possible scenarios , _ only _ those that lead to a very large energy deposition ( well in excess of the binding energy ) can yield a successful , and visible , explosion .",
    "this may act as a natural tuning ingredient to favor fast - rotating cores in tightly - bound progenitors like wolf - rayet stars @xcite .",
    "the fraction of wolf - rayet stars that fail to explode following core collapse is unknown at present .",
    "this binding - energy argument may also be a very natural explanation for the lack of detection of type ii sn explosions for objects with main sequence mass greater than @xmath720 @xcite .",
    "the standard neutrino mechanism may , after all , fail to deliver an energy that is comparable to the binding energy of the more massive progenitor stars .",
    "and indeed , this may not be so surprising given the ten order of magnitude density contrast in the region 2 - 5 between the 11 and the 25 models of whw02 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rho_mr ] ) .",
    "this would suggest that a lot of core - collapse events associated with the higher mass massive stars do not yield explosions , but instead form a black hole with no transient electromagnetic display ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proposition of @xcite to monitor a large number of red supergiants for failed explosion would nourish this option .",
    "it is the low binding energy ( hence extended envelope structure ) of massive stars that causes the bright displays of their ejected envelopes , even for low energy deposition , and even in the absence of any heating from unstable isotopes . in general , the change from a modest - size progenitor star to an extended ejecta causes a dramatic cooling , primarily due to expansion . and indeed , in type ia / b / c sne , this cooling is dramatic and the large sn luminosity results only because of the presence of unstable isotopes , whose half - life of days to weeks makes the sn bright on a comparable time - scale .",
    "in contrast , only modest radial expansion ( typically by 2 orders of magnitude compared to 57 in type i sne ) occurs after the explosion of the already extended envelopes of h - rich massive stars . in such objects , large luminosities of 10@xmath5110@xmath52",
    "can be achieved without the contribution from unstable isotopes , and even for modest ejecta kinetic energies .",
    "hence , in general , low - energy ( stellar ) explosions / eruptions should occur from regions that are weakly gravitationally - bound .",
    "given the very low envelope binding energy of low - mass massive stars and hence the very low energy threshold for producing explosion / eruption , we argue that these should be prime candidates for transient events in the universe , perhaps even in connection to interacting sne . the stellar initial - mass function is also biased in favor of such low - mass massive stars , which are therefore not rare ( about one for every 200 solar - type stars ) .",
    "this argumentation likely applies to sn 2008s @xcite , m85-ot2006 - 1 @xcite , or the enigmatic sn2008 ha @xcite .",
    "as argued above , the association of a low - energy low - luminosity ejecta with a wolf - rayet progenitor , believed at present to always be a highly - bound object , seems unlikely ( although not excluded in theory ) in the context where the energy deposition occurs deep within the progenitor star . in that context",
    ", it would require the presence of a loosely - bound shell at the surface of the progenitor star and a pretty exquisite tuning to allow the energy deposition occurring at depth to be no more than a few 1.001 times the envelope binding energy",
    ". some of these postulates may not apply ( e.g. could the energy deposition occur just below the surface of the wr star ? ) , but it is unclear at present which is faulty .",
    "specific radiation - hydrodynamical simulations based on suitable progenitors are needed to address this problem .",
    "a growing sample of transient objects possess intermediate luminosities between sne and novae .",
    "their origin is debated .",
    "owing to their low energy , the community has argued for either a weak - energy core - collapse sn explosion ( e.g. @xcite ) , or for a super - eddington wind in a sn impostor ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ambiguity stems from the common energy - ground in which events associated with these two scenarios fall , the @xmath1910@xmath43erg kinetic energy of the homunculus associated with @xmath12 car rivaling that of low - luminosity type ii - p sn ejecta . reversing the argument , how many of these low - luminosity type ii - p sne are in fact impostors , boasting ejecta kinetic energy that are well below that of lbvs ?",
    "the `` sn '' status in this energy regime seems to be often based on faith rather than on unambiguous observational or theoretical evidence .    in the shock - heated solutions we presented in  [ var_edep ] , the ejecta are systematically turned into a radiation - dominated plasma . at shock breakout , they are essentially unbound ( their total energy @xmath53 is positive ) and possess a large amount of internal energy .",
    "in those models with low - expansion velocity and super - eddington luminosities of 10@xmath5410@xmath51 , the photosphere has properties that are comparable to those of erupting lbvs , yet their super - eddington luminosity plays no role in driving the material , which was already unbound after shock passage .",
    "from an inspection of the long - term light curve , it seems difficult to distinguish between the two since the time - scale over which the radiative display evolves is very long and related to radiative diffusion : apart from the breakout signature , it bears no imprint of the explosive origin , i.e. the sudden and deeply - rooted release of energy .",
    "the recent observation of fast - moving material ahead of @xmath12 car s homunculus points very strongly toward a shock - heated envelope as the origin of the giant eruption @xcite .",
    "the invocation of a super - eddington wind in the low - mass progenitor star associated with sn2008s may be supporting the same hypothesis since low - mass massive stars are well below their eddington limit , while a shock could easily take them beyond that limit . an interesting and generic component of all the shock - heating scenarios that we explored in this paper is the associated shock - breakout signal , whose detection could therefore disentangle situations associated with a quasi - steady wind from a hydrostatically - bound super - eddington atmosphere on the one hand from those associated with a slowly - moving shock - heated ejecta on the other hand .      while the binding energy of massive star envelopes increases with progenitor mass , the mean",
    "binding energy is low for all objects that have retained a hydrogen envelope . in particular , and in the models of whw02 ,",
    "that outer h - rich shell has a very uniform and very low binding energy of 10@xmath18erg . owing to mass loss ,",
    "the mass of that shell decreases with time for higher - mass massive stars , but it always remains loosely bound . in our simulations , we found that even for a very modest energy deposition , well below the binding - energy value , important structural changes of the envelope occurred .",
    "we suspect that hydrodynamic - fluid instabilities taking place deep in the stellar interior @xcite may provide the energy seed for at least a fraction of the variability observed in massive stars .",
    "this has not been fully realized so far in part because studies of stellar variability tend to isolate the surface layers and ignore the interior , while studies of stellar interiors reduce all the complicated physics occurring near the surface to imposed and simplified conditions at the grid outer boundary ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that , owing to their huge surface radii and therefore low binding energy , supergiant and hypergiant stars should be very sensitive to such perturbations from the stellar interior , and indeed observations of such stars reveal a rich and violent mass - loss history @xcite .",
    "similarly , objects that through the course of their _ quasi - steady _ evolution happen to lie close to the eddington limit and/or reach critical rotation are naturally more exposed to potential _ time - dependent _ deeply - rooted energy leaks .    this does not exclude the role of other mechanisms for mass ejections , for example , pulsations , rotation , radiation - driven mass loss etc .",
    ", although it is at present not clear how these processes can produce the extreme properties required in the context of high - luminosity interacting sne or giant eruptions of lbvs .",
    "in this paper , we have presented one - dimensional one - group ( gray ) two - temperature radiation - hydrodynamics simulations of pre - sn massive - star envelopes subject to a sudden release of energy above their degenerate core . although at the high energy end , the likely phenomenon is core collapse , we more generally have in mind the thermonuclear incineration of intermediate - mass elements present in shells above the core . the motivation for this study is : 1 ) the existence of interacting sne ( which must eject a shell at least once before core - collapse , but more likely eject multiple shells , by some means not elucidated so far ) ; 2 ) the identification of fast - moving material exterior to @xmath12 car s homunculus ( which can not stem from radiation - driving in a wind ; @xcite ) ; 3 ) the broad range of energies inferred for type ii - p sne , overlapping at the low - energy end with high - energy transients and massive - star eruptions .",
    "the bulk of our results stem from work on the 11 model of whw02 , although tests with higher - mass progenitors yield the same qualitative conclusions and regimes , merely shifted quantitatively .",
    "this work is an exploration of the outcome of a strong , sudden , and deeply - rooted energy deposition taking place at the base of a massive - star envelope .",
    "we are not proposing this scenario holds for all massive - star mass ejections , but we investigate what results when this circumstance obtains . there is no doubt it does , but how frequently and how robustly is left for future study .",
    "although this result is not new , we find that the fundamental quantity controling the outcome of a strong , sudden , and deeply - rooted energy deposition is the binding energy of the stellar envelope , which increases considerably with progenitor mass in the range 1040",
    ". what is new , however , is our study of the long - term evolution of the gas and radiative properties that result from configurations where the energy deposited is greater , on the order of , or less than the envelope binding energy .",
    "we identify three regimes , with a continuous progression from 1 ) sn explosions at high energy ( @xmath4 ) , with a complete envelope ejection associated with a 100-day long high - plateau luminosity ; 2 ) sn impostors at the intermediate energy range ( @xmath5 ) , with a partial envelope ejection , and a more modest but longer - lived plateau luminosity ; and 3 ) bloated / variable stars at the low - energy end ( @xmath6 ) , with little or no mass ejection but with a residual puffed - up envelope of weakly - modified properties .",
    "what conditions the results is not the magnitude of the energy deposition itself but how it compares with the binding energy of the envelope exterior to the site of deposition .",
    "hence , to achieve the same result requires more energy in a more massive progenitor star .",
    "these properties are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_summary_ekin ] .    in all simulations",
    "presented , a shock forms systematically with a strength that depends on the energy deposited .",
    "it crosses the envelope in @xmath71 to @xmath750 days , hence communicating its energy to the entire progenitor envelope _ quasi - instantaneously _",
    ", i.e. as opposed to , e.g. , a diffusion time - scale for energy transport of 10@xmath27 years or more at the corresponding depth .",
    "this shock eventually emerges at the progenitor surface with a breakout signal that varies from a duration of an hour up to a few days ( modulated here by the shock speed rather than by the atmospheric - scale height ) , with a flux peaking at longer wavelengths for weaker shock strengths .",
    "this breakout signal is the ( and may be the only ) _ unambiguous _ evidence that the subsequent  ejection \" was triggered by shock - heating , and thus has an explosive origin .    at shock breakout ,",
    "the luminosity reaches a peak , then fades , before stabilizing / rising again forming an extended plateau .",
    "this plateau phase corresponds to the recombination epoch of the ejected mass , the internal energy decreasing primarily through expansion and little through radiation .",
    "it is the large stored internal energy ( in the form of radiation ) that keeps the ejecta optically thick and luminous ( radioactive decay is neglected in our work ) .",
    "we find a continuum of light curves , faster - expanding ejecta being more luminous both at breakout ( stronger shock ) and during the plateau phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig_summary_lpeak ] ) .",
    "the models presented in  [ var_edep ] corroborate the correlation between plateau luminosity and mid - plateau photospheric velocity identified by @xcite , and refined by @xcite .",
    "we also find that the plateau duration is anti - correlated with energy deposition ( fig .",
    "[ fig_summary_dt ] ) . at larger energy ,",
    "faster expansion leads to faster cooling and recombination so that the ejecta photosphere recedes faster in mass / radius after reaching its peak earlier",
    ". for small energy variations in this regime , interplay between kinetic and internal energy ( which are comparable at breakout ) yield a plateau duration that is @xmath7100d , which is on the order of type ii - p plateau lengths . for lower energy deposition , we switch slowly from a regime of dynamic diffusion to that of quasi - static diffusion .",
    "the more slowly - expanding ejecta , characterized by a slowly - decreasing optical depth with time , gives the bolometric luminosity a modest peak value and a slow evolution , with plateau durations of up to 1 - 2 years .",
    "the plateau phase is thus more extended and fainter for lower energy deposition , echoing the light - curve trend going from sne to sn impostors ( fig .",
    "[ fig_obs_lc ] ) .",
    "note that , in our simulations , these time - scales are always 6 - 7 orders of magnitude larger than the time - scale for the energy deposition , which was chosen to be ten seconds in most cases . in other words , the time - scale over which the light curve evolves ( basically that of radiative diffusion in an expanding medium ) has no connection to the time - scale over which the energy was deposited in the first place .    from our exploration and with our set of models , we find that explosions of varying strength can yield the broadest range of outcomes in _ low - mass _ massive stars because they are characterized by a very low envelope binding energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig_eb_mr ] ) .",
    "we indeed obtain light curves evolving from week to year time - scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig_s11_lum_all ] ) and ejecta expansion rates ranging from a few tens to a few thousand ( fig .",
    "[ fig_s11_phot ] ) .",
    "an explosion / eruption producing a transient requires merely 10@xmath20erg in such objects , a value that is so low that gravitational collapse of the stellar core may not be required . and",
    "indeed , in this mass range , stellar - evolutionary calculations reveal the existence of nuclear flashes in the last nuclear - burning stages @xcite , which could represent such an energy source .",
    "we therefore propose that low - mass massive stars are prime candidates for transient phenomena in the universe , as well as prime canditates for interacting sne such as 1994w @xcite .    in our simulations , sudden energy deposition above",
    "the core leads to shock - heating of the _ entire _ envelope .",
    "whenever the energy deposited is greater than its binding energy , the _ entire _ envelope is ejected , with an asymptotic kinetic energy that is commensurate with the energy deposited . if a subsequent energy deposition occurs ( e.g. a nuclear flash followed by gravitational collapse , as needed in a fraction at least of interacting sne ) , the second ejection would have low mass and little or no hydrogen .",
    "depending on the time between the two ejections , one could get an interacting sn for a short delay ( i.e. a few years ) or two transients at the same location for a long delay ( the first one being dim if the explosion energy is small and the second one being potentially very dim due to the low ejected mass ) .",
    "these scenarios are rather speculative , but they are warranted since at present most , if not all , transients have an unknown origin and are poorly characterized .    in our simulations , and within the context of this work , we obtain small mass ejections only when depositing the energy close to the progenitor surface , an eventuality that seems difficult to justify physically in such massive stars",
    ". such low - mass ejections would seem to be better suited , for example , to the surface layers of an extended white dwarf .",
    "observationally , low - mass ejections are likely to be associated with fast transients . for transients that are both fast and faint , a low - mass ejection in a highly- or moderately - bound object seems required . at the least ,",
    "our simulations for ( loosely - bound ) rsg stars perturbed by a small deeply - rooted energy release produce large mass ejections ( the overlying hydrogen envelope ) and long - faint transients .",
    "synthetic spectra computed for a sequence of models with varying energy deposition reveal a continuous evolution from type ii - p sn - like spectra at high energy ( @xmath5510@xmath52 ) , to low - luminosity type ii - p sn spectra at intermediate energy ( @xmath5510@xmath51 ) , to sn - impostor - like spectra at low energy ( @xmath5510@xmath54 ) , with , in the same order , narrower line profiles and redder / cooler spectral - energy distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig_v1d_sed ] ) .",
    "the results from this work should not be compromised by the approximations made in our radiation - hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "first , with one dimensionality we prevent convective transport and any structure formation through , e.g. , rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "this may alter the properties of models characterized by low expansion speeds ( longer evolution time - scale ) ; we thus plan to study this eventuality with 2d and 3d simulations in the future .",
    "second , we deposit the energy at a large and fixed rate , independent of any feedback effects . in the case of nuclear flashes , such feedback effects could shut - off the burning prematurely .",
    "we are aware of this artifact and will attempt in future work to develop a more physically - consistent approach by investigating the conditions that may lead to shock formation , rather than assuming a setup that systematically leads to it",
    ". however , provided a shock forms , we think our results apply .",
    "third , progenitor models may differ on a mass - by - mass comparison with other groups but the general trend of increasing binding energy with main sequence mass should hold .",
    "fourth , one - group transport should be accurate enough since it has been shown to capture the essentials of such radiation hydrodynamics simulations @xcite - the key physics presented here takes place at large optical depth , under lte conditions .",
    "our finding that very modest energy perturbations can dramatically affect the structure of a massive star motivates detailed multi - dimensional hydrodynamical investigations of massive - star interiors , in particular of the last burning stages preceding core - collapse ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as shown in these hydrodynamical simulations , and more generally , we surmise that the quasi - steady state approach of standard stellar - evolutionary codes ( which keep an eye on the longer - term evolution of stars ) may be missing important ingredients for our understanding of massive - star evolution .",
    "this has relevance for understanding mass loss and in particular massive - star eruptions , stellar variability / stability , and interacting sne .",
    "such pre - sn mass ejections would also modify , and perhaps sizably , the envelope mass and structure , thereby affecting the conditions surrounding core collapse and explosion .",
    "ongoing and forthcoming surveys / missions like pan - starrs , sky mapper , the palomar transient factory , galex , or the large synoptic survey telescope will better reveal the diversity of explosions , eruptions , and more generally transient phenomena in the universe .",
    "we surmise that surveys up to now have missed a large number of low - energy long - lived transients , such as low - luminosity type ii - p sne ( objects even less energetic than sn1999br ) and sn impostors .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that we have not yet detected type ii sne with plateau durations well in excess of 100 days .",
    "moreover , for the shock - heating solutions presented here , a breakout signal systematically takes place . at sn - like energies",
    ", the signal may be too short to be resolved @xcite , but for lower - energy transients , the reduced shock speed and strength would lengthen the breakout duration up to about a day , and move the peak of the spectral - energy distribution from @xmath7100  to the 1000 - 3000  range .",
    "hence , the breakout signal should be more easily detectable in such transients , allowing to distinguish between an explosive event and , e.g. , a super - eddington wind .",
