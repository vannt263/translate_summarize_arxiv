    "large scale isotropy and homogeneity is the most fundamental assumption of modern cosmology .",
    "those assumptions make it possible to solve einstein s equations , which reduce to two differential equations with only one parameter , the scale factor . to test this hypothesis and to estimate the effect of the deviations from homogeneity and isotropy",
    "an averaging formalism was developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been critisized in @xcite that this approach relies on an a priory fixed frame and is thus gauge dependent .",
    "an alternative has been suggest which is valid for infinite spacial volumes . in this work",
    "we use a physical reference frame , the frame of comoving dust , to perform the averaging in a manifestly gauge independent way .",
    "our formalism is applicable to finite volumes . at the end",
    "we compare our result to the equations obtained in @xcite and show that they are equivalent in the frame of the introduced pressure - less fluid .",
    "starting from local inhomogeneous einstein equations an averaging procedure is set up to derive effective equations which quantitatively measure the deviation from the friedmann equations which describe the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time . to avoid the question of coordinate fixing and",
    "hence gauge dependence a system of freely falling observers will be introduced and used to perform the averaging .",
    "it is important to mention the compatibility of the dust as coordinate system with a deformed frw universe , as it respects the fundamental symmetries of the background .",
    "we know that our universe used to be homogeneous to a very high precision and hence was described well by the frw universe",
    ". however , nowadays there are large inhomogeneities locally present in the universe .",
    "nevertheless , observations of the large scale structure suggest that the underlying geometry is not drastically different from an homogeneous and isotropic space on horizon scales .",
    "therefore , it is sensible to use a laboratory which does not destroy the frw space - time , since it has the appropriate symmetries .",
    "the dust we are going to use fulfils this criterion .      we consider a space - time filled with matter and demand that the energy density of this matter should never vanish .",
    "this assumption allows to avoid the problem of seemingly indeterministic behaviour of general relativity ( gr ) , known as the hole problem @xcite . demanding a non vanishing matter content we are able to give physical meaning to every point in space - time .",
    "this is also a reasonable assumption on physical grounds , since even the voids contain some amounts of cosmic dust or radiation .",
    "furthermore , it is speculated that there is matter present in the universe , which interacts only ( or almost only ) with gravity .",
    "the dark matter is considered to be `` cold '' i.e. non- relativistic in the standard model of cosmology , hence it can be well described by dust .",
    "thus , our model can be viewed as a realistic cosmological model incorporating the cold dark matter .",
    "the distribution of matter in our model though is not homogeneous , since it is supposed to represent a universe perturbed about the frw background symmetry .",
    "this is the difference to the approach in @xcite , we allow for matter to exist which is distributed inhomogeneously and hence it is possible to find physical fields with a space - like gradient .    within our model",
    "the energy momentum tensor can be decomposed in the way described below , since we have demanded for the energy density never to vanish .",
    "we can view this in two ways .",
    "either the dust of low energy is formally separated from the total energy momentum tensor , or it is added to it , which would not affect the system strongly .",
    "@xmath0    where the @xmath1 is the dust energy momentum with infinitesimal @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the energy momentum tensor of the rest of the system .",
    "consequently the lagrangian of the theory is as follows    @xmath4    the gravitational lagrangian is the ricci scalar multiplied by the square root of the metric determinant .",
    "the dust lagrangian is    @xmath5    with the following eight fields , @xmath2 being the energy density , @xmath6 eigentime , @xmath7 velocity field and @xmath8 coordinate field , where @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath6 has a time - like gradient and the @xmath8 s have obviously space - like gradients .",
    "this fields will be used for the construction of a window function which transforms as a scalar .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the lagrangian formalism and not be concerned with the form of the physical hamiltonian . on the other hand we know that a physical hamiltonian exists , since the system with dust deparametrizes , as has been shown in @xcite .",
    "the eigentime of the dust particles is a map into the dust - time manifold    @xmath11    at each fixed value @xmath12 , @xmath6 is a scalar w.r.t .",
    "coordinate changes on the manifold @xmath13 in the sense    @xmath14    where @xmath15 . on the dust - time manifold @xmath6",
    "is trivially a scalar",
    ". this will be scalar with a space - like gradient which will be used for the construction of the window function .",
    "we take the eigentime @xmath6 of the dust particles as the scalar field which generates the time flow .",
    "therefore the unit time - like vector is    @xmath16    the foliation is defined as the hypersurfaces on which @xmath6 takes constant values .",
    "it is the physical time of the dust field .",
    "this defines a time - space split with the projector orthogonal to the time flow    @xmath17      the dust is a collection of geodesic observers , freely falling on @xmath13 .",
    "each particle carries a label , at any instant of time @xmath18 a particle has a position , so this position of the labeled particle is a physical value and hence a dirac observable . taking the continuum limit ,",
    "while keeping the particle density constant we obtain a field , where the indices of the particles can be viewed now as three dimensional coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a map from the hypersurface of constant time into the dust - space manifold of constant @xmath12    @xmath21    now we define the quantity : @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 are for evry fixed pair of values @xmath24 and @xmath6 scalars on @xmath13 , ( omit the bar in the coming discussion )    @xmath25    where @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand they are three vectors on @xmath26 .",
    "to construct a quantity which is a scalar on @xmath13 and @xmath26 , more work is required .",
    "the basic idea is to construct a scalar on @xmath26 out of the coordinate fields of the dust , a quantity like @xmath27 .",
    "therefore we need the induced metric on the hypersurfaces @xmath28 . to get this object",
    "we pull back the orthogonal projector @xmath29 on the hypersurface of constant @xmath6 denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "to stay general we introduce coordinates on @xmath30 called @xmath31 which represent a map    @xmath32    furthermore , the coordinates on @xmath13 are denoted by @xmath33 and represent a map    @xmath34    the combined map which we are going to use for the pull - back is @xmath35 , defined as    @xmath36    we can visualize the interrelations as follows    , the hypersurfaces of constant dust - time are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath37 .",
    "while the map @xmath38 goes from the dust - space to the space of internal coordinates of the hypersurface of constant dust - time , the map @xmath39 goes from this internal space to the manifold .",
    "therefore , the combination of both maps goes from the dust - space slice to the full space - time manifold and is used for the pull - back . ]    with the pull backs of the maps given as    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    the choice of the @xmath39 and @xmath38 maps corresponds to the gauge choice .",
    "later we will evaluate the result in the the so called adm gauge where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , therefore @xmath45 .",
    "after defining the maps we come back to the main goal and pull - back on the dust space    @xmath46    here the property has been used that @xmath47 is orthogonal to the tangents of @xmath26 : @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 .    note : for the construction we have used the orthogonality of the time flow to the spatial hypersurfaces . to ensure this",
    "we can pick the dust velocity field @xmath50 to vanish .",
    "this is simply assuming that the dust we consider is rotation free , which is reasonable for all practical purposes .    the constructed quantity commutes with the 3-diffeomorphism constraints and in the next step we construct the observable , using the dynamic equation with @xmath51 being @xmath52 from the adm split :    @xmath53    here @xmath54 with @xmath55 some scalar density and @xmath56 the total hamiltonian constraint of the system .",
    "even if an analytic solution to this equation can not be obtained , we can set initial values by field re - definition and perform a series expansion .",
    "the solution of this equation @xmath57 is used to define the observable @xmath58    @xmath59    this quantity commutes for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath20 with all constraints and is hence an observable . in the following",
    "we will omit the bar for simplicity .",
    "now we found the tensor quantity on @xmath26 which is needed for the contraction with the vectors and can write    @xmath60    the dust vectors are contracted with a tensor on the dust manifold and one obtains a physical scalar on @xmath13 and on @xmath26 .",
    "it transforms as    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    where on @xmath13 : @xmath15 and correspondingly on @xmath26 : @xmath63 .",
    "we check the transformation properties below .    * the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath64 is a scalar under coordinate changes on the manifold by construction , an explicit calculation shows it in components : + @xmath65 * the constructed quantity @xmath66 is a scalar on @xmath26 since the 3-vectors @xmath8",
    "are contracted with a rank two tensor on @xmath26 .",
    "again explicit calculation shows : @xmath67 * the connecting relation which makes the whole object invariant under coordinate transformations on the manifold is that the @xmath8 s are the dust labels and hence scalars on @xmath13 as discussed above : + @xmath25 + where @xmath15 .",
    "now we have shown that @xmath66 is a scalar on @xmath13 and on the dust manifold @xmath26 . since the @xmath68 is a scalar on @xmath26 we can express it in arbitrary coordinates @xmath31 on @xmath30 , the adm split hypersurface of constant @xmath6 .",
    "this coordinate representation is also convenient for the window function which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "having constructed physical scalars we write the window function as    @xmath69    with @xmath70 is a dirac delta function and @xmath71 the step function .",
    "the window function constructed in ( [ eqn : window ] ) is a scalar on @xmath13 and @xmath26 i.e. it transforms as    @xmath72    now the functional is set up in the following way    @xmath73    the averaging functional of a quantity @xmath26 can be defined using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : functional ] ) , and simplified integrating out the delta function leading to    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the hypersurface on which @xmath76 , @xmath77 the determinant of the induced spatial metric discussed above and @xmath78 the lapse function for a general not synchronous gauge .",
    "the average is manifestly a gauge independent quantity , since @xmath79 and @xmath80 are scalars under diff(@xmath81 ) and also diff(@xmath26 ) and so the window function is also a scalar , leading to the following transformation property of the averaging functional    @xmath82    introducing @xmath83 we obtain @xmath84    the gauge functional is obviously gauge invariant and hence the average of @xmath26 is an observable .",
    "equipped with this functional we can address the problem of averaging the scalar parts of einstein s equations of the model of the universe presented above , where the coordinate system , the dust , is included into the studied system .",
    "we will perform a similar analysis as in @xcite , but in a more general way , since our formalism applies also to finite volumes .      to average the dynamic equations of our model it is also necessary to compute time derivatives of the averaged quantities . in this case the time derivative means partial derivative w.r.t @xmath85 the eigentime of the homogeneous dust used for the deparametrisation .",
    "let us begin with the derivative of @xmath86",
    ". the strategy will be to choose certain coordinates in which the computation will be easier and then to generalize our result to an arbitrary frame .",
    "the eigentime @xmath6 is the function that defines the space as hypersurfaces on which it assumes a constant value , therefore , it is spatially homogeneous . in this case",
    "we can choose coordinates , in future referred to as adm coordinates , such that : @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath78 is the lapse and @xmath89 the shift .",
    "the metric reads :    @xmath90    furthermore , since we have set the velocity field @xmath91 of the coordinate dust to zero , which implies the orthogonality of @xmath47 to the spatial hypersurfaces , the shift vectors vanish . in this coordinates we compute the time derivative .",
    "the partial derivative commutes past the integral and the derivative of the @xmath92 distribution we understand in the weak sense    @xmath93    in the coordinates chosen we can read of from the form of @xmath94 the only component of @xmath95 which is non - zero : @xmath96 and @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "thus , eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : derivativeaverage ] ) simplifies to    @xmath99    here @xmath100 and @xmath101 , since @xmath102 in this gauge and the trace @xmath103 . having this",
    ", we can rewrite the expression in a covariant way , so that it reduces to our result when the adm coordinates are fixed    @xmath104    the last term vanishes in case @xmath105 i.e. the spatial coordinates do not depend on the time variable .",
    "this is indeed the case in our model since @xmath47 is orthogonal to the space such that @xmath106 which implies the above relation .",
    "hence the time derivative reads    @xmath107    now we can calculate the time derivative of the average of a scalar    @xmath108    covariantly expressed we obtain the general form of the buchert , ehlers commutation rule , @xcite :    @xmath109      in order to be interpreted as a domain dependent scale factor analogous to the @xmath110 of the frw model , a quantity has to be considered which is gauge independent . as any physical observable must not depend on the coordinates chosen .    to accomplish this we use the gauge independent averaging functional to define the quantity @xmath111 to be the effective scale factor    @xmath112    using ( [ eq : derivative of functional ] )",
    "one sees that @xmath113    and hence    @xmath114      a more pictorial way to describe this , is to write    @xmath115    leading to    @xmath116    we see from this calculation that @xmath111 has indeed a property of a scale factor , but its definition above circumvent the necessity of introducing a normalization at a certain initial time point .",
    "we will derive the expressions for the averaged hamilton constraint density and the raychaudhuri equation , the important point of the derivations is that in our set up the @xmath117 , which defines the time flow of the coordinate dust , is already present in the model and is not chosen arbitrarily . the time arises natural and there is no need of artificial gauge fixing .",
    "thus , we describe the time flow without formally choosing a gauge .",
    "the einstein tensor multiplied with the time flow vectors ( which is equivalent to the hamiltonian constraint density ) gives    @xmath118    where the expansion rate and the shear are defined w.r.t @xmath94 , the @xmath119 is the spatial curvature associated with the projector on the hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath94 .    on the other hand one has from the matter contribution",
    "@xmath120    with @xmath121 since we said that the velocity field @xmath91 vanishes .",
    "now the hamiltonian constraint density can be averaged . for normalization",
    "divide it first by @xmath122 apply the averaging functional introduced above and insert the identity by adding and subtracting the average of @xmath123 squared we get    @xmath124    using    @xmath125    and defining the backreaction    @xmath126    we rewrite ( [ eq : hamilton constraint ] ) as    @xmath127    this is the effective equation describing the velocity of the expansion of the domain dependent scale factor .",
    "it is the analogue to the first friedmann equation . with the definitions comparable to those in @xcite we can write the cosmological energy balance :    @xmath128    @xmath129    @xmath130    @xmath131    @xmath132    @xmath133    from the energy balance equation we see that the backreaction term @xmath134 as well as the coordinate mass term",
    "@xmath135 enter the balance and the backreaction term opens the possibility of contributing to an effective cosmological constant term .      combining the hamiltonian constraint density with the trace of the einstein equations projected orthogonal to the time flow",
    ", one gets    @xmath136    which is equivalent to    @xmath137    in our model the last term gives    @xmath138    now we will need the second time derivative of the scale factor s :    @xmath139    we will use the commutator ( [ eq : commutation rule ] ) and eqn . ( [ eq : adot ] ) to get    @xmath140    rewriting    @xmath141    we can insert ( [ eq : rauchaudhuri ] ) into the first term    @xmath142    this is the effective raychaudhuri equation for the domain .",
    "there is an analogy to the second friedman equation , since it describes the acceleration of the domain dependent scale factor s.      in this subsection we will evaluate the general equations in the adm gauge , which was introduced above , and compare them to the effective equations obtained by t. buchert . as a reminder in the adm gauge @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath78 is the lapse and @xmath89 the shift .",
    "since we have chosen @xmath94 to be orthogonal to the spatial hypersurfaces the shift vectors vanish i.e. the metric reads : @xmath143 .",
    "especially we get for    @xmath144    and    @xmath145    since @xmath85 defines the hypersurface of constant physical time .",
    "given that , the hamiltonian constraint reduces to    @xmath146    and the raychaudhuri equation reads as    @xmath147    setting @xmath148 we obtain :    the hamilton constraint density    @xmath149    and the raychaudhuri equation :    @xmath150    note : the coordinate dust energy @xmath2 has a negative effect on the acceleration .",
    "the averaging functional with the window function reduces in this gauge to    @xmath151      to perform integration in general we need a push forward from the manifold into the @xmath152 , in our case a map from the dust space into @xmath152 is required .",
    "define : @xmath153 s.t .",
    "@xmath154 where @xmath155 is the map @xmath156 , @xmath38 the map @xmath157 , @xmath39 the map @xmath158 and @xmath159 the dust - space slice .     used for the push forward into @xmath152 .",
    "this map is a combination of maps from the dust - space slice of constant dust - time to the space of internal variables : @xmath38 , the map from this internal space to the manifold @xmath81 : @xmath39 and the map form the manifold to the @xmath152 : @xmath155 . ]",
    "it was already shown that @xmath68 is gauge invariant so now it is legitimate to fix a gauge .",
    "a legitimate choice would be @xmath160 the identity , @xmath39 the map from the hypersurface coordinates @xmath161 to the manifold coordinates @xmath162 and therefore @xmath163 . in the adm gauge the coordinates are @xmath51 and @xmath31 as read of from the metric @xmath164 .",
    "this leads to    @xmath165    rewriting the average functional one obtains    @xmath166    which is a volume integral over a sphere of radius @xmath167 . with this formalism",
    "the effect of inhomogeneity on an effective friedmann model can be estimated and an example of application to the ideal fluid cosmology can be found in the appendix [ app : ifc ] .",
    "the difference between our formalism and the averaging applied by t. buchert in @xcite is that we did not choose a gauge from the beginning but deparametrized the manifold with dust .",
    "this introduced a time in the theory .",
    "furthermore we found a way to perform gauge invariant averages over finite volumes .",
    "hence the averaged quantities @xmath168 became physical observables and we obtained equations governing their dynamics .",
    "the equations we get after fixing the adm gauge are slightly different to the ones in @xcite .",
    "we recover buchert s equations in our general formalism if we set the rest energy momentum @xmath169 to zero .",
    "therefore one could think that in buchert s formalism just the geometry is averaged .",
    "the problem with this point of view is that even an infinitesimal energy density @xmath2 leads to a geometry arbitrary far away from the vacuum geometry , since there is no smooth limit @xmath170 .",
    "hence one has to see that buchert s equations describe correctly the evolution of a cosmology filled with one type of pressure - free fluid in the rest frame of this fluid .",
    "we see that in this special case the procedures of gauge fixing and averaging commute .",
    "our formalism allows to generalize the averaging to an almost arbitrary energy momentum tensor .",
    "the only restriction is that the energy density must not vanish anywhere .",
    "especially it is not possible to apply this formalism to space - time devoid of all matter .",
    "a manifestly gauge invariant averaging formalism for finite volumes was presented in this work .",
    "the question of gauge dependence of the backreaction was resolved .",
    "the model used just required the assumption of a non - vanishing energy density . in this case",
    "a dust energy momentum tensor can be separated from the total energy density .",
    "the coordinate fields of the dust were used as a reference frame to perform averaging .",
    "the derived equations for the average of an arbitrary energy momentum tensor were evaluated in the adm gauge , which corresponds to choosing the rest frame of the dust .",
    "furthermore , as an example the equation is evaluated for an energy momentum tensor of an ideal fluid .",
    "the resulting equation was also studied in the adm gauge .",
    "an interesting phenomenon was observed , as discussed in the ideal fluid cosmology in the appendix [ app : ifc ] .",
    "it appears that `` tilt '' effects ( i.e. non - co - linearity of the dust flow and the fluid s flow ) contribute negatively to the acceleration of the domain dependent scale factor .",
    "the derived equations in the adm gauge were compared to the buchert equations .",
    "we are able to interpret the buchert equations in the gauge independent framework .",
    "it turned out that they describe the averaged behaviour of a pressure - free fluid , using this fluid itself as a reference and choosing it s rest frame .",
    "it turns out that in this special case gauge fixing and averaging commute .    by deriving gauge independent equations for the cosmological backreaction",
    ", we proved that it is in principle an observable . with this formalism at hand",
    "it is possible to study cosmological data and can trust the derived equations to correctly describe the observations , once we identify a system of freely falling observers .",
    "one could go one step further and argue that given the necessity to explain the abundance of a matter species , which mainly -or entirely- interacts gravitationally , we can view our system with the coordinate dust as a realistic cosmological model . in which case the dust is the dark matter which behaves , according to observations as a pressure - less fluid .",
    "an interesting and may be fundamental observation is , that it is not possible to define averaged observables in a space - time devoid of matter .",
    "i would like to thank k. giesel , s. meyer and m. bartelmann for very helpful discussions .",
    "i acknowledge support from the imprs for precision tests of fundamental symmetries .",
    "most warmly i would like to thank s. hofmann who has suggested to study this topic and has provided vital guidance during the completion of this work .",
    "a cosmology equipped with an energy momentum tensor of an ideal fluid will be studied .",
    "this is a reasonable choice for the energy momentum , since it is the most general tensor fulfilling the symmetries of an isotropic universe and since we know from the cmb that the universe has been extremely isotropic this model is a reasonable choice",
