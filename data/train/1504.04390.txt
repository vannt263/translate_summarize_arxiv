    "after the discovery of a 125 gev sm - like higgs boson @xcite , the focus of the lhc program has shifted to the searches for the new particles beyond the standard model ( sm ) . among many promising new physics models , the mssm has been extensively investigated by theorists and experimentalists . at the lhc ,",
    "the typical signature for the supersymmetry is the multi - jet plus missing transverse energy in the final states .",
    "other topologies involving leptons , photons and heavy quarks have been explored in various simplified models as well .",
    "however , up to now , no significant excesses ( @xmath9 ) beyond the sm were observed at the lhc .",
    "recently , the atlas collaboration has reported the @xmath10 excess in the on-@xmath1 region in the search for the same - flavour opposite - sign dilepton pair , jets , and large transverse missing energy @xcite . including both of electron and muon pairs ,",
    "the atlas collaboration observed 29 events after the selection cuts , while the expected sm background events are @xmath11 .",
    "although such an excess is currently not confirmed by the cms analysis @xcite , it is interesting to study it in various new physics models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors argued that the atlas on-@xmath1 excess can be explained in the general gauge - mediation ( ggm ) framework .",
    "but later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors claimed that such a model can not explain the excess due to the lhc constraints . in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering the constraints from the lhc searches for the multi - jet and the missing transverse energy @xcite , the author proposed an explanation through gluino pair production in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) . besides susy interpretations , a heavy gluon decay to the vector - like quarks in the composite higgs theories was suggested to explain the atlas on-@xmath1 excess @xcite .    in many popular supersymmetric grand unification models , the first - two generation squarks appear to be heavier than the third generation squarks , due to the different renormalization effects related to the yukawa coupling contributions . in particular",
    ", a right - handed sbottom can be light in some models @xcite .",
    "a heavy stop sector is usually required by the observed 125 gev higgs boson in the mssm , however , the large mixing effect can also achieve the correct higgs mass and lead to a relatively light stop . therefore ,",
    "if sufficiently light , the third generation squarks could be copiously produced through the gluino decay .",
    "on the other hand , the gluino - mediated the third generation squarks productions have been searches for at the lhc .",
    "the null results give the strong bounds on the stop / sbottom and the gluino mass @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the gluino - mediated sbottom production with @xmath12 in a simplified scenario inspired by the mssm and examine its interpretation for the atlas @xmath1-peaked excess reported under the lhc constraints .",
    "we also study the feasibility of the explanation of the gluino - mediated stop production for the excess .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section2 ] , we will set up our calculations and present the numerical results .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in section [ section3 ] .",
    "in order to reduce the sm background events , the following requirements are applied in the atlas searches for the final states containing a same - flavour opposite - sign lepton pair , jets and large missing transverse momentum .",
    "* events are required to have at least two same - flavour opposite - sign ( sf - os ) leptons .",
    "if more than two signal leptons are in a event , the two with the hardest @xmath13 are selected .",
    "the leading lepton must have @xmath14 gev and the sub - leading lepton @xmath15 can be as low as 10 gev .",
    "the invariant mass of these two leptons has to be in the @xmath1 boson mass window 81 @xmath16 101 gev . *",
    "all events are further required to contain at least two hard jets with @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 , to have missing transverse energy @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 gev , where @xmath21 is the @xmath13 sum over all the jets with @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 and the two leading leptons : @xmath22 . *",
    "besides , the azimuthal angle between each of the two leading jets and @xmath23 has to be larger than 0.4 .    from the above selection criteria , we can infer that a strong production process is more favored than an electroweak process to explain the atlas observed on-@xmath1 excess due to the requirement of the multiplicity of jets and a hard @xmath21 cut @xcite .",
    "so , we will focus on the gluino production in the following",
    ".     theoretical uncertainty.,width=288,height=192 ]    in fig.[cx ] , we calculate the nlo+nll cross section of the gluino pair production at 8 tev lhc by using package @xcite with the cteq6.6 m pdfs @xcite .",
    "we can see that the cross section of the gluino pair @xmath24 can still reach tens of fb when the gluino mass @xmath25 tev .",
    "if there is no branching ratio suppression in the gluino cascade decay chain , assuming @xmath26 tev and the signal events keeping efficiency @xmath27 , one can obtain about 25 on-@xmath1 events at 8 tev lhc with the luminosity of @xmath28 fb@xmath29 .",
    "any reduction in the branching ratio or in the event keeping efficiency will require the gluino to be light to enhance the total cross section .",
    "however , a light gluino ( with the mass less than 1 tev ) usually suffers from the strong lhc constraints .",
    "thus , the most economic way to explain the atlas on-@xmath1 excess is to make the branching ratio of the gluino cascade decay with a @xmath1 boson in the final states as large as possible .",
    "signal.,width=288,height=96 ]    in fig .",
    "[ feyn ] , we show the diagram of the gluino decay chain that is relevant for our study . if @xmath30 , the produced gluino will dominantly decay to the sbottom . however , the sbottom decay depends on the nature of sbottom and the electroweakinos . the interaction between sbottom and neutralinos",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath31 \\tilde{\\chi}^0_i   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\tilde{b}_r \\bar{b } \\left [ -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}g ' n_{i1 } p_l + y_b n_{i3 } p_r \\right ] \\tilde{\\chi}^0_i + h.c.,~ \\label{vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath34 of the neutralino sector are defined in @xcite . for @xmath35",
    "being higgsino - like neutralino and @xmath36 being bino - like neutralino , we can see that the right - handed sbottom can have the sizable decay branching ratios of @xmath37 in comparison with the case of @xmath35 being wino - like neutralinos @xcite .",
    "in particular , when @xmath38 is not allowed by the phase space , the decay of @xmath37 will be dominant . then , the higgsino - like neutralinos @xmath35 can exclusively decay to the @xmath1 boson , if @xmath39 .",
    "so , we study a simplified scenario of the mssm , which consists of a heavy gluino ( @xmath40 ) , a right - handed sbottom ( @xmath41 ) , a bino - like lsp ( @xmath42 ) , two neutral ( @xmath5 ) and one charged ( @xmath43 ) nearly degenerate higgsino - like nlsps .",
    "other sparticles are assumed to be heavy and are decoupled for simplicity . in tab .",
    "[ bp1 ] , we use a mssm benchmark point to illustrate our arguments , where the @xcite and @xcite are used to calculate the masses , the couplings and the branching ratios .",
    "all the soft susy breaking mass parameters are defined at the weak scale .    .",
    "a benchmark point for the gluino - mediated sbottom production . here",
    "the mass parameters @xmath44 ( gaugino masses ) , @xmath45 ( higgsino mass ) , @xmath46 ( the soft breaking masses for the first two generation squarks ) , @xmath47 ( the cp - odd higgs boson mass ) , @xmath48 ( the soft breaking masses for the third generation squarks ) and @xmath49 ( the third generation trilinear couplings ) are in unit of gev .",
    "@xmath50 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two - higgs doublet fields in the mssm .",
    "the gluino pair cross section is calculated up to nll+nlo for lhc-8 tev .",
    "[ bp1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we examine the lhc constraints on our scenario and investigate the atlas on-@xmath1 excess in the allowed parameter space region . in general , one can vary the mass splitting @xmath51 in the range of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the range of @xmath54 , respectively . however , the smaller mass differences become , the fewer on-@xmath1 events are kept , due to the requirement of a large value of @xmath21 in the atlas analysis .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 gev in the gluino decay chain . finally , only the gluino mass and the right - handed sbottom mass are the free parameters in the following scan of our parameter space .",
    "other irrelevant sparticles are assumed to be heavy , which include the sleptons , the first two generations of squarks , the stops , the winos , the heavy cp - even higgs boson and the cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "to study the lhc direct search constraints on our parameter space , we use the package @xcite to recast the atlas analysis of the gluino - mediated sbottom production @xcite and the search for the multi - jet with transverse missing energy events @xcite .",
    "besides , we reinterpret the cms search for the multi - jet events @xcite to examine its constraint on the parameter space by using the package @xcite .",
    "both of the packages use the tool @xcite , where the anti-@xmath57 algorithm is chosen for the jet clustering @xcite .",
    "the validations of these analyses have been done by the two groups .",
    "the parton level signal events are generated by the package @xcite and are showered and hadronized by the package @xcite .",
    "the detector simulation effects are included with the tuned package @xcite , which is contained in and .",
    "finally , we define the ratio @xmath58 for each experimental search , where @xmath59 is the number of the signal events for the @xmath60-th signal region and @xmath61 is the corresponding observed 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit .",
    "the max is over all the signal regions for each search .",
    "if @xmath62 , we conclude that such a point is excluded at 95% c.l ..     signal events from the gluino - mediated sbottom production . the blue triangles and pink bullets represent the events number of the on-@xmath1 signals that can explain the atlas excess in and outside 2@xmath0 range , respectively .",
    "the cyan region is excluded by the atlas search for gluino production in final states with missing transverse energy and at least three @xmath6-jets @xcite.,width=288,height=288 ]    in fig .",
    "[ zpeak ] , we present the on-@xmath1 signal events from the gluino - mediated sbottom production on the plane of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the blue triangles and pink bullets represent the number of the on-@xmath1 events that can explain the atlas excess in and outside 2@xmath0 range , respectively .",
    "the cyan region is excluded by the atlas search for the gluino - mediated sbottom production in the final states with the missing transverse energy and at least three @xmath6-jets @xcite , which is found to be the most stringent bound on our scenario . from the fig .",
    "[ zpeak ] , we can see that when @xmath64 is lighter than 800 gev , the mass difference @xmath65 should be less than about 20 gev to avoid the constraint .",
    "however , such a small splitting can not produce the large value of @xmath21 that is required by the atlas analysis of the on-@xmath1 signal .",
    "if @xmath64 becomes heavy , the cross section of the gluino pair production will reduce rapidly .",
    "so , we find that only a small parameter region with @xmath66 and @xmath67 can marginally explain the atlas on-@xmath1 excess at @xmath7 level .    we also have considered a similar scenario where the gluino dominantly decays to the right - handed stop with the sbottom being decoupled . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 bosons can be produced through the decay chain @xmath68 .",
    "but the branching ratios of @xmath69 are usually less than @xmath70 since @xmath8 is the dominant decay mode of the right - handed stop @xcite . besides",
    ", such a scenario are strongly constrained by the lhc searches for the multi - jet events and the gluino - mediated stop production .",
    "so it is hard to explain the atlas on-@xmath1 excess through the gluino - mediated stop production .    in the above discussions , only the light right - handed sbottom or stop",
    "is involved in the gluino cascade decay process .",
    "if both of them are light enough , the gluino will decay to @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this will lead to the suppression of branching ratios of @xmath73 and fewer on-@xmath1 signal events than the above two cases .",
    "so , we can conclude that such a light sbotttom and stop scenario can not give a better explanation than our studied sbottom scenario .",
    "given the current excess is only reported by the atlas , with more data in lhc run-2 , both atlas and cms analyses will be able to further confirm this excess if it is indeed a signal of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "on the other hand , no matter this anomaly will persist or not , a compressed gluino - mediated sbottom production is an interesting scenario to be explored at the future lhc @xcite .",
    "in this work , we study the possible explanation of the recent atlas 3@xmath0 on-@xmath1 excess through the gluino - mediated sbottom production in a simplified scenario inspired by the mssm , where the spectrum consists of a gluino , a right - handed sbottom , two neutral and one charged nearly degenerate higgsino - like neutralino nlsps and a bino - like neutralino lsp . under the lhc constraints , in particular the atlas search for gluino - mediated sbottom production in final states with the missing transverse energy and at least three @xmath6-jets",
    ", we find that the atlas on-@xmath1 excess can only be marginally explained at @xmath7 level in a narrow allowed parameter space region , where the mass splittings between the gluino and the sbottom are less than about 100 gev . besides",
    ", we note that if the gluino decays to right - handed stop instead of sbottom , it is hard to explain the excess because the stop will largely decay to @xmath74 without @xmath1-boson being produced .",
