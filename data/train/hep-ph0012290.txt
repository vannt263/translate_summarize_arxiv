    "recently the intriguing preliminary data obtain at `` sphere '' group ( lhe jinr ) on the deuteron tensor analyzing power @xmath0 , measured in the reaction on fragmentation of tensor polarized deuterons into cumulative pions with nonzero pion production angle , have been reported @xcite .",
    "they are rather precise and correspond to a maximum cumulative variable @xmath2 of @xmath3 ( internal momentum up to @xmath4 mev / c ) .",
    "since in the @xmath5 collisions the deuteron gets from proton a momentum comparable with the deuteron mass , these data are probing the truly relativistic dynamics inside the deuteron @xcite .",
    "the interest of deuterons fragmentation into pions arises from the possibility ( i ) to experimental study of the polarization observables of deuteron fragmentation into hadrons containing of different quarks , additionally to well - famous proton stripping reaction @xcite , ( ii ) to theoretical study of nuclear structure at short distances on a based of available deuteron models , ( iii ) to develop in the future the reasonable theory of the relativistic nuclear systems .",
    "the measurement of the unpolarized characteristics together with polarization observables allows us to analyze this processes more correctly and to conclude that together with the scheme of the deuteron wave function ( dwf ) relativization the relativistic description of such processes themselves is of important as well .    in this talk",
    "we present a relativistic invariant analysis of the deuteron tensor analyzing power @xmath0 performed in the framework of the relativistic impulse approximation at nonzero pion production angle ( see , for review , the paper @xcite , which contains also our calculation of @xmath6 at zero pion production angle ) .",
    "let us consider the inclusive reaction of fragmentation of tensor polarized deuteron to pion , @xmath7 , where the typical initial energy of a few gev , and the final pion is detected with nonzero angle @xmath8 . within spectator mechanism approach this reaction presented by the impulse approximation diagram shown in figure [ fig1 ] , where the upper and lower vertices should factorize @xcite and consequently they may be computed separately .",
    "if the initial deuteron is only aligned due to @xmath9 component , then the inclusive spectrum of this reaction can be written in the form : @xmath10~ ,   \\label{def : ayy }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the inclusive spectrum for the case of unpolarized deuterons and @xmath0 is the tensor analyzing power .",
    "they can be written in a fully covariant manner within the bethe - salpeter formalism .",
    "this way is possible to come to general conclusions about the amplitude of the process not to seen in the non - relativistic approach .",
    "such analysis of the deuteron models is very important assuming the searching of nuclear quarks phenomena @xcite .",
    "one can write the observables ( [ def : ayy ] ) in the factorization form @xcite : @xmath12~{d^3q\\over e_{\\bm q}}~ ;   \\label{un.cs } \\\\   & & \\rho_{pd}^\\pi\\cdot{\\rm a}_{yy } = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.6 cm }   { 1\\over(2\\pi)^3 } \\int { \\sqrt{\\lambda(p , n)}\\over\\sqrt{\\lambda(p , d)}}~\\left [   \\rho_{pn}^\\pi\\cdot\\phi^{(t)}(|\\bm q|)\\right ]   \\left({1 - 3 \\sin^2\\theta_{\\bm q } \\sin^2\\varphi_{\\bm q } \\over 2}\\right ) ~{d^3q\\over e_{\\bm q } }   \\label{calc : ayy }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the flux factor ; @xmath14 are the four - momenta of the proton - target and intra - deuteron nucleon , respectively ; @xmath15 is the relativistic invariant inclusive spectrum of pions produced by interacting the intra - deuteron nucleon with the proton - target . in the general case",
    ", this spectrum can be written as a three - variable function @xmath16 .",
    "feynman s variable , @xmath17 , is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pion momentum in the center of mass of two interacting nucleons and @xmath20 . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 is more sensitive to the dwf form than this invariant spectrum .    the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 depends on the relative momentum @xmath23 and contains full information about the structure of deuteron with one on - shell nucleon .",
    "they can be written in terms of positive - energy , @xmath24 , and negative - energy , @xmath25 ,   @xmath26 , wave functions : @xmath27~ ;   \\label{phi(u ) } \\\\",
    "\\phi^{(t)}(|\\bm q| ) & = & 2\\sqrt2 uw + w^2 + v_t^2 - 2v_s^2 \\nonumber \\\\   & - & { 4\\over\\sqrt3}{|\\bm q|\\over m}\\left[\\left(u - { w \\over \\sqrt2}\\right )    { v_t \\over \\sqrt2 } + \\left(u + \\sqrt2 w\\right)v_s\\right]~.   \\label{phi(t ) }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is intuitively clear that the two nucleons in the deuteron are mainly in states with angular momentum @xmath28 ( see also numerical analysis of the solutions of the @xmath29 equation in terms of amplitudes within the @xmath30-spin basis @xcite ) , so the probability of states with @xmath31 @xmath32 in eqs.([phi(u)],[phi(t ) ] ) is much smaller in comparison with the probability for the @xmath33 configurations .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the @xmath34 and @xmath35 waves directly correspond to the non - relativistic @xmath36 and @xmath37 ones .",
    "therefore , eqs.([phi(u)],[phi(t ) ] ) with only @xmath33 waves can be identified as the main contributions to the corresponding observables and they may be compared with their non - relativistic analogies . the other terms posses contributions from the @xmath1-waves and they are proportional to @xmath38 ( the diagonal terms in @xmath39 are negligible ) . due to their pure relativistic origin",
    "one can refer to them as relativistic corrections .",
    "the natural way to compare the non - relativistic and relativistic calculations is the kamada - gl@xmath40ckle method @xcite that is used to make relativistic quantum models using a realistic nonrelativistic nucleon - nucleon interaction as input , which requires the operator for the kinetic energy is formed out of square roots .",
    "this defines the scale transformation between the relativistic momenta @xmath41 in eqs.([phi(u)],[phi(t ) ] ) and nonrelativistic momenta @xmath42 : @xmath43 and renormalization of the dwf , that simply ensures that the change of variables is unitary : @xmath44 \\over h[\\bm q_{kg}(\\bm q)]}~ , \\label{dwf - kg}\\ ] ] where we defined the function @xmath45 by the equation : @xmath46 then , the transformation involves the simple rescaling and the renormalization , that ensures unitarity of an @xmath36-matrix .",
    "the minima for deuteron components are shifted towards larger momenta .",
    "the effects are large above about @xmath47 @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "let us consider the `` minimal relativization scheme '' describes rather well the differential cross section for such process as deuteron break - up @xmath50 .",
    "the minimal relativization procedure @xcite consist of ( i ) a replacement of the argument of the non - relativistic wave functions by a light - cone variable @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 in the deuteron rest frame , and ( ii ) multiplying the wave functions by the factor @xmath54 @xmath55 . as a results",
    "the argument is shifted towards smaller values and the wave function itself decreases less rapidly .",
    "this effect of increasing the wave function is compensated by the kinematical factor @xmath55 .",
    "the results of calculation are summarized in figures below , where the tensor analyzing power @xmath0 as function of the cumulative @xmath2 ( `` cumulative number '' @xcite ) is shown . for our reaction , this variable is defined as follows : @xmath56 the value of @xmath2 corresponds to a minimum mass ( in nucleon mass units ) of part of the projectile nucleus ( deuteron ) involved in the reaction . when the pion with @xmath2 larger than 1 is produced , it is assigned to the cumulative pion .",
    "this kinematical region corresponds to the values of the light - cone variable @xmath57 ( [ def : lcv ] ) and internal deuteron momentum @xmath58 , as presented in the following table for the planed case @xcite of pion production angle @xmath59 mrad .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    deuteron fragmentation into proton @xmath60 is one of the more intensively studied reaction with hadronic probe .",
    "as shown in @xcite , both the differential cross section and @xmath61 for fragmentation @xmath62 can be described within the ia up to @xmath63  gev / c only .",
    "the inclusion of correction to ia related to secondary interactions allows one to describe the experimental data on the deuteron fragmentation @xmath64 at @xmath65  gev / c @xcite .",
    "the calculated results of @xmath0 for the reaction of polarized deuteron fragmentation into cumulative pions are shown in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . from this",
    "figures one can see that it is quite incorrect to use the nonrelativistic dwf for the analysis of deuteron fragmentation into pions .",
    "relativistic effects are sizable , especially in the kinematic region corresponding to short intra - deuteron distances or large @xmath2 .",
    "the figure [ fig3 ] shows a small dependence of the tensor analyzing power @xmath0 to the pion production angle on the contrary to the experimental data . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental data on @xmath0 are not described by any dwf used in this calculus over all region @xmath66 .",
    "for a present time , the most sophisticated theoretical approaches are unable to describe properly the experimental data in the cumulative region of this notoriously difficult reaction . then the following questions still open :    1 .",
    "why the measured @xmath61 and @xmath0 for deuteron fragmentation into pions are not reproduce by ia even for internal momentum @xmath67 gev / c where the same observables for deuteron breakup reaction are in a good agreement with ia ?",
    "+ @xmath68  additional to ia mechanisms @xcite ?",
    "moreover the data on @xmath61 at zero angle have small value as it have to be for case of isotropic source from which pions are emitted .",
    "the calculations presented in this work performed in the framework of nucleon model of deuteron . for the small inter - nucleon distances ( equal or less of hadron size ) the use of nucleon as a quasi - particle seams to be groundless and effects of manifestation of non - nucleon degrees of freedom in deuteron could be expected . in spite of this",
    "the data on @xmath0 can be cause by + @xmath68  non - nucleonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
