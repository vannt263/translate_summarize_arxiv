    "however , ions such as sodium @xmath0 or potassium @xmath1 can interact with proteins in the cell membrane that transport the ions across the membrane .",
    "_ ion channels _ are one of the three types of proteins involved in the ion transport ; the others are the _ pumps _ and the _ carriers_. approximately , an equal portion of the ionic current passes through each of these routes @xcite .",
    "classic experiments using the patch clamp technique showed an interesting stochastic behaviour of the ion channels that is controlled by the voltage across the membrane @xcite .",
    "for example , this behaviour is crucial for the phenomena of neural excitability @xcite .",
    "the _ fractal model _ of ion channel kinetics was formulated @xcite and widely discussed in relation to the _ markov model _ @xcite .",
    "recently , kramers diffusion theory has been considered as an alternative to those models @xcite .",
    "one should also mention a significant improvement in the data analysis @xcite namely , a new method was developed for the identification of deterministic structure in the time series , such as obtained from the patch clamp experiments , and successfully applied to the hearth disease and the epilepsy research .    in all above experimental and theoretical analyses , the kinetics of the single ion - channel was investigated . in this paper we discuss collective effects in both infinite - size system ( sec .  [ dete ] ) , and realistic system ( sec .  [ stat]-[pertu ] ) of a few - hundred coupled ion channels along the cell membrane .",
    "we discuss the so - called _ step - like _ empirical model of the ion - channel switching affected by the voltage across the membrane that is based on that proposed by hodgkin and huxley @xcite , but is much simpler and approximately rationalises the experimental data for the potassium and the sodium channels @xcite .",
    "in this section we discus a simple model of ion channel switching and apply it to the system of @xmath2-channels across the membrane ( see fig .  [ elec ] ) .",
    "= 0.8    the ion channels are formed by specific membrane proteins which undergo a spontaneous , voltage - sensing conformational transitions between the _ open _ and the _ closed _",

    "hereinafter , we will concentrate on isolated assembly of @xmath2 ion channels of one type , i.e.  potassium k@xmath3 .",
    "let us suppose the simplest @xmath4-state markov model of the single channel switching ( this is not a strict supposition , because such a model is equivalent to the @xmath2 + 1  -state markov model of the whole membrane , cf .",
    "[ stat ] ) . in this model",
    "such a channel is characterised by two microscopic parameters determined by the voltage @xmath5 across the membrane : the inverse average open- and closed times ( @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively ) .",
    "physically , parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are measured indirectly in a time series obtained from patch clamp experiment for single channel @xcite , whereas @xmath5 is the driving parameter controlled in such an experiment .",
    "subsequently , the expectation value of the fraction of opened channels @xmath10 obey the two - state , `` open - closing '' dynamics @xcite : @xmath11 for the sake of convenience , one can define the decay constant @xmath12 ( that provides natural timescale of the processes ) , and the probability of single channel open @xmath13 , which allow us to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ nopenll ] ) in form : @xmath14 in further considerations , parameter @xmath15 is regarded as constant , and used to define the dimensionless time : @xmath16 one can verify this approximation for a broad range of voltage across the membrane @xmath5 by looking at the experimental data ( see table [ kexp ] ) . with this simplification , only one microscopic parameter @xmath17 remains .",

    ", one can find the trapping times @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be in the same order as corresponding decay times defined by first excited eigenvalue @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 , where the factor @xmath24 could be simple explained by representing the probability distribution in the form : @xmath25 , and calculating the shanon entropy in this manner : @xmath26 where approximation works for @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the value of shanon entropy for the stationary distribution @xmath29 .",
    "one remarkable feature of the shanon entropy @xmath21 for the membrane is that its value for the stationary distribution is not always maximal , for same cases entropy @xmath21 can decrease as a function of time ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ trapsh ] ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact , that we are studying a dissipative system , connected to the environment ( see sec .
