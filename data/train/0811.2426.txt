    "in the standard scenario of structure formation galaxies reside in massive dark matter ( dm ) haloes , where baryons can shock , cool and eventually form stars .",
    "haloes form by gravitational instability , starting from some density fluctuation field @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , a dark matter halo with mass @xmath4 , forms when the linear density field , smoothed on scale @xmath5 , exceeds some critical threshold @xmath6 @xcite .    in a cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "framework , the galaxy formation process is hierarchical along cosmic time : small systems collapse earlier , in a denser universe , and later merge to form larger haloes . in particular",
    ", haloes often grow as a consequence of repeated merging events with smaller satellites .",
    "present - day surviving satellites form the so - called subhalo ( or substructure ) population of a given host system @xcite .",
    "dark matter haloes and subhaloes provide the environment in which galaxies form and evolve @xcite . therefore",
    ", understanding the assembly histories of dark matter haloes is the first step towards the comprehension of the more complex processes involved in galaxy formation .    in order to study the framework of structure formation",
    ", two different approaches have commonly been used .",
    "the first is to run @xmath7-body simulations @xcite .",
    "these are very powerful tools , that can be used to reproduce the collapse of dark matter haloes with high mass and force resolution , both on galaxy and galaxy - cluster scales .",
    "they allow to follow gravitational collapse up to its fully non - linear evolution . on the other hand , simulations are computationally expensive , and nonetheless can not cover the full spectrum of masses relevant to structure formation .",
    "the second approach is to use some analytical modeling , which allows a detailed study of the merging history of haloes over an arbitrarily large mass range , under suitable simplification of the problem .",
    "this is the case of the press & schechter formalism @xcite .    as underlined before , haloes collapse on a certain scale once the linear density contrast smoothed on that scale exceeds some threshold value .",
    "the nonlinearities introduced by these virialized objects do not affect the collapse of overdense regions on larger scales .",
    "this simple assumption leads to the derivation of the global mass function of dark matter haloes that is in fair agreement with that found in @xmath7-body simulations @xcite . during the last decades ,",
    "an extension of this theory was made by several authors @xcite with the aim of computing the probability that a halo of mass @xmath8 , at redshift @xmath9 , belongs to a given halo of mass @xmath10 at redshift @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this quantity was named `` conditional '' or `` progenitor '' mass function , @xmath12 .",
    "this allowed different authors to estimate quantities such as the merger @xcite and creation rate @xcite , and the formation time distribution of dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "the extended press - schechter formalism can be numerically implemented to produce stochastic realizations of the merging history tree of haloes of any mass ; these monte carlo merging histories can have , theoretically , arbitrary resolution in mass and time , and their result is the full population of progenitor haloes at all times , for some final halo . the only thing they do not provide is spatial information on the haloes themselves .",
    "therefore , when the focus is on the statistical properties of haloes and not on their position or internal structure , monte carlo merger trees have the advantage - over @xmath7-body simulation - of virtually unlimited mass resolution . implementing a code to reach",
    "the required resolution is however not straightforward , and caution must be used in order to preserve consistently with the theory .    in this paper",
    "we will build a spherical collapse monte carlo merger tree with arbitrary mass and time - step resolution , and will consider a @xmath13-power spectrum .",
    "we will populate a milky - way sized halo with subhaloes with masses as small as @xmath14 .",
    "this value correspond to the typical jeans mass for the a cdm weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) particle with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such a value for the minimum mass can actually vary between @xmath16 and @xmath17 depending on the underlying particle physics @xcite .",
    "we will take into account the progenitor haloes accreted by the main branch of our milky - way like halo , in order to obtain a snapshot of the spatial distribution of substructures today . * in this way we will select only the first order of substructures which populate the halo today ( those which are orbiting in the host halo potential ) , in order to correctly model the radial dependence of subhalo properties . in other words , we will avoid the bias of our previous works ( see , e.g .",
    "@xcite ) towards the small scale structures . in those works ,",
    "the embedding of sub - subhalos within subhalos was not treated correctly .",
    "each structure existing inside the main halo was indeed considered as orbiting inside the potential of the host halo itself . in this way ,",
    "an analytical treatment of the effect of subhalos on the expected photon flux from dm annihilation was possible .",
    "however , it was not possible to take into consideration the fact that a number of small scale structures are indeed sub - substructures , that is to say they are orbiting inside the potential of the subhalo they belong to , and not inside the potential of the host halo . in the present work we will be able to separate and study the effect of introducing sub - subhalos .",
    "* with the same partition code we will thus compute the subhalo population of subhaloes ( i.e. subhaloes within subhaloes ) , and we will consider the special case of a draco - like satellite . in the second part of the paper we will estimate the @xmath1-ray emission from dark matter annihilation , in the subhalo population of the milky - way and of a draco - like subhalo , and will discuss the different contributions to @xmath1-ray emissions due to the smooth and clumpy components of the considered systems .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ subgamma ] we study the @xmath1-ray emission from dark matter annihilation in subhaloes and sub - subhaloes and estimate the possibility to be detected with the fermi - lat telescope . in sec.[deconc ] we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "the simplest algorithm for a merger tree uses a binary split . in this scenario each halo is split in two haloes at an earlier epoch .",
    "each of these is in turn divided in other two pieces , and so on until all halo masses fall below an arbitrary chosen and desired mass resolution @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed the failure of using a binary merger tree . in this way the first halo which is chosen from the press & schetchter distribution",
    "follows the correct probability , but the second one is chosen only in order to conserve mass and does not follow the theoretical model as expected .",
    "this leads to a conditional mass function and formation redshift distribution in disagreement with the extended press & schechter predictions . to solve this problem , @xcite proposed a new algorithm able to reproduce the conditional mass function quite well , at the expenses of using a finely tuned grid of time - steps .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite used the results of @xcite and realized that , for white - noise initial conditions , mutually disconnected regions are mutually independent . in this case",
    "it is possible to split a halo into progenitors very efficiently .",
    "the so obtained conditional mass function is in excellent agreement with the theoretical model of the spherical collapse .",
    "the great advantage of this method is that it is possible to obtain arbitrary high mass resolution for any given time - step , generating progenitors in a very fast and efficient way .    in this section",
    "we will describe the way the method developed by @xcite can be generalized considering a @xmath18 power spectrum using this algorithm , we will follow the creation and the assembly history of a present - day milky - way sized halo .    assuming that the dark matter is a wimp , the jeans mass of the smaller dm halo is given by its free - streaming scale @xcite , and for a dm particle mass of 100 gev this smallest halo mass has a typical mass @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore extend our merger tree down to microsolar mass resolution , in order to study the present - day subhalo population down to the dark matter jeans mass .",

    "an important quantity that describes the hierarchical growth of the haloes is the conditional distribution .",
    "it gives the probability that a particle , belonging to a clump with @xmath7 particles at time @xmath32 , is part of an @xmath33-clump at @xmath34 , and can be written as : @xmath35^{n - n-1}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "we found that the prediction for the @xmath1-ray flux is indeed more pessimistic than the ones obtained in previous estimates * which were not correctly taking into account the embedding of small scale sub - subhaloes within subhaloes , and therefore adding their contribution to the host halo total flux instead of to the subhalo they belong to .",
