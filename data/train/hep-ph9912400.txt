    "the starting point of the work presented in this communication is an evidence : what is measured by @xmath7 and @xmath8 fixed target experiments are the differential cross - sections and not the structure functions .",
    "the former observables are described by a combination of three structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and , within pqcd , @xmath12 .",
    "there is no magic , to solve a system 2 equations with 6 unknowns one must provide some extra informations ... and the main part of these informations comes from the @xmath13 ( plus higher order corrections ) process : the deuce of structure functions [ @xmath14 , @xmath15 , extracted from the mixed @xmath7 and @xmath8 data , received some large corrections and especially from the strange density @xcite .    therefore , unlike what is currently done in the global qcd fits @xcite , we do not consider here the _ deuce _",
    "[ @xmath14 , @xmath15 but rather all the available differential cross - section measurements : bebc(h and d targets ) , cdhs ( h target ) and cdhsw ( fe target)@xcite .",
    "the fit presented here ( see @xcite for the details ) is very similar to the cteq5f3 one @xcite .",
    "the same combinations of parton densities are parametrised at @xmath16gev and evolved using the dglap equations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the neutrino data sets , the data entering the fit are @xcite : the fixed target and h1 charged lepton ( @xmath17 ) beam @xmath14 ; the drell - yan differential cross - sections and asymmetries . to avoid higher - twist corrections",
    "we also apply some data rejection cuts : @xmath18gev@xmath19 and @xmath20gev@xmath19 .    from this fit",
    "i ) _ determine @xmath3 and @xmath21 within an inclusive analysis , _ ii ) _ test the compatibility between charged lepton and neutrino beam observables ( see @xcite where an incompatibility is reported ) .",
    "in this communication we concentrate on the strangeness and we shall thus start by giving , in section 1 , some details concerning the nuclear corrections applied to the cdhsw data .",
    "this is an important feature since this data sample is the most significant statistically .",
    "the fit results concerning the two items _ i ) _ and _ ii ) _ pointed out above are given in section 2 .",
    "all cdhsw data are obtained from scattering off iron nuclei .",
    "since the theoretical understanding of nuclear effects in heavy nuclei is still uncertain and model dependent @xcite , we adopt an empirical procedure to perform the nuclear corrections .",
    "the basis of the procedure is that , in the ` naive ' qpm , @xmath23 and neutrino nucleon structure functions are proportional at high-@xmath24 .",
    "the experimental @xmath25 differential cross - sections are then fitted to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the correction factor for the non - isoscalarity of iron @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the first factor of the last equation is the @xmath31 structure function ratio @xmath32 which is obtained from a fit to the most precise experimental data on @xmath33 @xcite , uncorrected for isoscalarity ( the @xmath2 range is @xmath34 $ ] ) .",
    "the second factor contains the isoscalarity corrections and is computed from eq .",
    "( [ iso ] ) using @xmath35 .",
    "the different contributions to the nuclear corrections are shown in fig .",
    "[ isocor ] .",
    "this figure shows that isoscalar correction induces some large differences between the @xmath7 and @xmath36 data at high-@xmath2 .",
    "it is to be noticed that these corrections are also applied to the ccfr [ @xmath14 , @xmath15 data @xcite used actually to determined the valence quarks in the global fits @xcite .",
    "two fits were performed . in fit1",
    "we fixed @xmath37 but , unlike what is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we parametrise @xmath38 independently of the non strange sea . in fit2",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are parametrised independently requiring @xmath40 .",
    "of course , other parton densities are parametrised in order to determined all the observables entering the fits .    as a first result",
    "we indicate that from a statistical point of view a perfect agreement between @xmath23 and @xmath41 beam observables is observed with both fits .",
    "the disagreement observed in @xcite is therefore most likely related to extraction procedure of the deuce [ @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "a good agreement is also found between the bebc @xmath41 d target data and the cdhsw data .",
    "this gives us some confidence in the large nuclear corrections described in the previous section .",
    "the strange density determined by fit1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ splots ] where the error bands include the propagation of all the experimental uncertainties .",
    "a good agreement is found with the ccfr di - muon analysis @xcite results and one can also remark that @xmath3 is ` hard ' at @xmath42 .",
    "notices that a worse @xmath43 ( significantly worse ) is obtained if , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one fixes @xmath44 in fit1 .",
    "the results of fit2 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "[ s_over_sbar ] .        a significant non - singlet @xmath47 component is observed . from fit1",
    "to fit2 the contribution of the @xmath0 data to the global @xmath43 decreases .",
    "our results for @xmath46 are again not incompatible with the determination of ccfr @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ cdhsw_diff_18gev ] the following observable @xmath48\\,.\\ ] ] is compared to fit1 and fit2 . in the qpm",
    "one has @xmath49 $ ] so that fig .",
    "[ cdhsw_diff_18gev ] clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of the inclusive @xmath41 data to the strange quarks .",
    "we have shown that if the @xmath41 differential cross - section enters the pqcd fits instead of the neutrino structure functions one obtains : _",
    "i ) _ a good agreement between @xmath23 and @xmath41 dis observables ; _ ii ) _ a constraint on @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "however , since the nuclear correction applied to the @xmath25 data are large and determine empiricaly our results may be taken at a qualitative level : we have obtained some ` hard ' @xmath50 and @xmath51 - with @xmath50 ` harder ' than @xmath51 - distributions at high-@xmath2 and a non vanishing non - singlet density @xmath52 .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that a more quantitative determination of the strangeness may be possible in a near future using the forthcoming @xmath25 ccfr ( see u.k .",
    "yang s contribution ) and @xmath53 chorus ( see r. oldeman s contribution ) cross - section measurements",
