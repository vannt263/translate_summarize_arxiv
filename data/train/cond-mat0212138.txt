    "statistics of a polymer chain in various types of solvents near an impenetrable wall ( boundary ) with short  range attractive forces has been extensively studied because of its practical importance @xcite , and as a challenging problem within the modern theory of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the most frequently applied model for a polymer chain has been the self  avoiding ( saw ) random walk model ( that is , the walk without self  intersections ) , so that steps of the walk have been identified with monomers that comprise the polymer , while the solvent surrounding has been represented by a lattice .",
    "these problems have been mostly studied for models situated on two  dimensional ( 2d ) euclidean lattices using various theoretical methods , such as the series expansion method , the renormalization group ( rg ) techniques , the mean  field approach , monte carlo simulations , and the conformal invariance method . in the last two decades these problems",
    "have been also studied in a case of fractal lattices embedded in the two  dimensional euclidean space . on the other hand , in a more realistic three  dimensional case ( for the euclidean lattices , as well as for fractal lattices ) ,",
    "a smaller number of results have been obtained .",
    "the study of fractal lattices has an advantage not only because their intrinsic self  similarity makes the problem more amenable to an exact approach , but also because these lattices as such may serve to model porous media .    in this paper",
    "we report results of our study of a linear polymer situated in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fractal lattices that belong to the sierpinski gasket ( sg ) family of fractals , assuming the interaction between two adjacent nonconsecutive monomers and , in addition , assuming adsorbing interaction with the walls of the fractal interior .",
    "this problem has been studied in the case of the 3d euclidean lattices ( see , for instance @xcite , and references quoted therein ) , but the number of obtained results is definitely smaller than in the corresponding 2d case . in the 3d case ,",
    "the main endeavor has been manifested in attempts to establish phase diagrams @xcite in the interaction parameter space ( which consists of the monomer ",
    "monomer interaction parameter and the adsorption energy parameter ) .",
    "in addition to the phase diagram , attempts have been made to calculate critical exponents that characterize various polymer configurations .",
    "the first work of this kind for a fractal was done by bouchaud and vannimenus @xcite , who applied the renormalization group ( rg ) technique for the 3d sg with scale parameter @xmath11 . here",
    "we report results of our exact rg calculation for the 3d sg with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and our results for the sequence @xmath5 obtained via the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method .",
    "therefore , this paper appears to reflect an effort to extend our previous studies performed in the case of the two  dimensional fractal lattices .",
    "such an effort has been incited by the well  known fact that critical properties of a given model depend on dimension of the space in which the model is situated .",

    "here we would like to mention that this behavior of the crossover exponent will be demonstrated for larger @xmath0 as well , using the mcrg method ( see the next section of this paper ) .",

    "the fixed point parameters satisfy the relations @xmath281 and @xmath280 , where @xmath282 for @xmath11 and @xmath10 , while @xmath283 for @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the critical exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the same for the fractals with @xmath11 and @xmath10 , while for @xmath9 these two exponents are somewhat smaller . besides , we should point out that only for @xmath11 the crossover exponent @xmath3 is equal to the ratio @xmath284 which is related to the fact that only for @xmath11 the globular phase is compact . finally , by comparing values of the crossover exponent @xmath3",
    ", we may observe that in the attached globular phase the number of adsorbed monomers is relatively larger than in the corresponding euclidean phases ( @xmath285 ) .",
    "results obtained for the multi - critical points for the fractals with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see the middle right part of table i ) appear to be dependent on the parameter @xmath67 that describes energy of a monomer in the layer adjacent to the adsorbing boundary .",

    "indeed , for @xmath10 there is only one critical value @xmath295 of the parameter @xmath67 such that for @xmath296 and for @xmath297 , two different nonsymmetric fixed points ( one for each of the two intervals ) with three eigenvalues larger than one are reached . on the other hand , highly repulsive symmetric point , with four eigenvalues larger than one , can be approached only for @xmath298 .",
    "each one of the three multi - critical points describes its pertinent surface attached @xmath153chain which is manifested by the facts that @xmath299 and @xmath300 for @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath300 for @xmath205 , meaning that the corresponding two phases are anisotropic , whereas for the critical value @xmath298 the surface attached @xmath153-chain is isotropic .",

    "in this section we are going to apply the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method to calculate the critical exponents @xmath2 end @xmath3 for 3d sg fractals with @xmath305 .",
    "first , we shell present the mcrg calculation of the critical exponent @xmath2 . in order to find the saw critical exponent @xmath2 , in the bulk phase",
    ", we should determine the nontrivial fixed points of the rg transformations ( [ eq : rga ] ) and ( [ eq : rgb ] ) , and then we should solve the corresponding eigenvalue problem of the linearized rg transformations , that is , we should solve the equation @xmath306 where the asterisk means that all derivatives should be taken at the corresponding fixed point and the superscript prime is used instead of the superscript @xmath307 . knowing the relevant eigenvalue @xmath308 , we can determine the critical exponent @xmath2 using the formula ( [ exponent - nu ] ) . to learn a specific value of @xmath2 , for a given @xmath0 , one should first find the coefficients @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in the rg equations ( [ eq : rga ] ) and ( [ eq : rgb ] ) . as it was detailed in the previous sections , it has been possible to calculate the exact values of these coefficients only for @xmath309 .",
    "thus , to get an entire sequence of values of @xmath2 for @xmath305 , we are going to circumvent the problem of explicit determination of the exact coefficients in the rg equations by applying the mcrg technique .",
    "the mcrg method , allows direct calculation of derivatives that appear in the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : det1 ] ) .",
    "it starts by locating the bulk nontrivial fixed points , which requires , at the beginning , implementation of a mc simulation of the saws for a chosen initial set of values @xmath310 .",
    "in other words , we let the walker start his walking , at one fixed corner of the fractal generator and record the other corner , at which it leaves the generator , together with recording the total numbers @xmath311 and @xmath312 , of crossings of the @xmath89 , or @xmath90 , type through the elementary tetrahedron .",
    "the saw walker crosses an elementary tetrahedron in the @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) way ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) with the weight ( probability ) @xmath313 , and @xmath314 , respectively .",
    "we repeat this mc simulation @xmath315 times , for the same set @xmath310 .",
    "thus we find how many times the walker has passed through the generator in the @xmath89 ( or @xmath90 ) way and by dividing the corresponding numbers by @xmath315 we get the values of the functions ( [ eq : rga ] ) and ( [ eq : rgb ] ) , denoted here by @xmath316 and @xmath317 .    in this way",
    "we get the value of the sums ( [ eq : rga ] ) and ( [ eq : rgb ] ) without specifying the coefficients @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "then , the subsequent values @xmath318 and @xmath319 @xmath320 , at which the mc simulation should be performed , can be found by using the generalized  homing \" procedure @xcite , which can be terminated at the stage when the differences @xmath321 and @xmath322 become less than the statistical uncertainties associated with @xmath323 and @xmath324 , respectively . consequently , fixed point @xmath325 can be identified with the last value @xmath326 found in this procedure .",
    "having learnt the fixed point , we need to solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : det1 ] ) in order to find the critical exponent @xmath2 via the formula ( [ exponent - nu ] ) .",
    "thus , we should find the partial derivatives @xmath327 ( where @xmath328 ) at the fixed point .",
    "for instance , starting with ( [ eq : rga ] ) ( in the notation in which the superscript prime is used instead of the superscript @xmath307 ) and by differentiating it with respect to @xmath89 we get @xmath329 treating now @xmath76 as the grand canonical partition function , for the ensemble of all possible saws that start at one fixed corner of the fractal generator and leave it at the other one , we can write the corresponding ensemble average @xmath330 which can be directly measured in a mc simulation . finally ,",
    "comparing the last two equations , we can express one of the requisite derivatives in terms of the measurable quantity @xmath331    in a similar way one can find additional three derivatives , so that we can write the general formula @xmath332 where @xmath333 and @xmath334 stand for any pair of quantities from the set @xmath335 . in this way we can learn , through the mc simulations , the partial derivatives that appear in the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : det1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , calculating the above derivatives at the fixed point and solving the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : det1 ] ) we obtain @xmath336 which means that @xmath308 has been expressed in terms of quantities that all are measurable through the monte carlo simulations .",
    "accordingly , we can learn the value of the critical exponent @xmath2 through the formula ( [ exponent - nu ] ) .",
    "we have applied this technique for a sequence of of the 3d sg fractals and in table  [ tabela1 ] we present our findings for @xmath337 , for the extended chain ( in the bulk phase ) fixed point @xmath130 together with the related critical exponent @xmath105 .",
    "as one can see from table  [ tabela1 ] the fixed point values for @xmath338 , decrease much faster then the values for @xmath339 , when @xmath0 increases .",
    "this means that we may neglect parameter @xmath340 ( compared with @xmath341 ) for larger @xmath0 , that is for @xmath342 . in order to estimate the influence of the parameter @xmath340 on the values of the critical exponent @xmath2",
    ", we calculated , by the mcrg method , critical exponent @xmath2 for @xmath343 with @xmath344 .",
    "we obtained the following result @xmath345 , which deviate 0.03% from the value @xmath346 ( see table  [ tabela1 ] ) found using the nonzero value of @xmath340 .",
    "concerning the analogous results for the collapse transitions ( @xmath153 critical point ) in the bulk phase , we have to point out that the corresponding point @xmath347 can not be located because the initial part of the applied technique ( the  homing procedure \" ) does not possess the needed convergence .",
    "we now apply the mcrg method to find the crossover critical exponent @xmath3 ( which determines the number of adsorbed monomers ) for the polymer phase , on the 3d sg fractals , described by the symmetric fixed point ( [ eq : symmetricspecialfp ] ) . to this end",
    ", we have to solve the eigenvalue problem for the second part ( that starts with the third equation ) of the rg transformations ( [ eq : rga])([eq : rgb1 ] ) , which reduces to solving of the equation @xmath348 here the asterisk indicates that all derivatives should be taken at the symmetric fixed point @xmath349 .",
    "the above equation gives , in general , three eigenvalues for each @xmath0 , but in practice it turns out that only one of them ( to be henceforth denoted by @xmath350 ) is relevant . knowing @xmath350",
    "we can determine the critical exponent @xmath3 through the formula @xmath351 hence , in an exact rg evaluation of @xmath3 one needs to calculate partial derivatives of sums ( [ eq : rga1])([eq : rgb1 ] ) , and thereby one should find the coefficients @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 by an exact enumeration of all possible saws for each particular @xmath0 , which has been accomplished for fractals with @xmath309 .",
    "however , for @xmath305 , as in the case of the bulk phase , the exact enumeration turns out to be a formidable task .",
    "we have circumvent this problem by applying the mcrg method . within this method ,",
    "the first step would be to locate the symmetric fixed point .",
