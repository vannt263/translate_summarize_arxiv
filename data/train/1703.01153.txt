    "<S> deep - inelastic scattering , in the laboratory and on the lattice , is most instructive for understanding how the nucleon is built from quarks and gluons . </S>",

    "<S> consider , for example , a generic moment of any deep - inelastic structure function of the nucleon regularized on the lattice by a hard cut - off @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are reduced nucleon matrix elements of local operators of twist two and four , respectively , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding reduced wilson coefficients </S>",
    "<S> . the operator @xmath6 mixes with @xmath7 with mixing coefficients which diverge as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the power divergences of @xmath9 must be cancelled with those of @xmath10 , which demands a nonperturbative calculation of the wilson coefficient as well . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by an entirely nonperturbative calculation of the structure functions only .    </S>",
    "<S> so far lattice calculations of nucleon structure functions have been limited to calculations on the parton level  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method that goes beyond that and computes the deep - inelastic structure functions , including power corrections , directly from the product of electromagnetic currents . </S>",

    "<S> . the appropriate renormalization factor @xmath50 can be computed unambiguously  @xcite . no further renormalization is needed . to compute the compton amplitude from the feynman - hellmann relation , we introduce the perturbation to the lagrangian @xmath51 where @xmath52 has dimension mass . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless , the amplitude does encompass all contributions , including the power - suppressed ` cats - ears ' diagram shown in the right panel . </S>",

    "<S> knowing @xmath49 for sufficiently many values of @xmath18 , we can solve ( [ opess1 ] ) for the moments @xmath56 and ( [ opess2 ] ) directly for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we want to keep the photon momentum @xmath57 fixed , but vary the nucleon momentum @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to a relatively cheap calculation , as all nucleon energies @xmath59 can be computed from a single set of background field configurations ( per value of @xmath52 ) . for nonsinglet quantities , </S>",
    "<S> in which the currents couple to valence quarks only , no additional gauge field configurations will have to be generated at all .    </S>",

    "<S> efficient algorithms for solving ( [ va ] ) can be found in the literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can cast the @xmath66 s into a simple functional form by the interpolating polynomial @xmath67 the moments @xmath61 can then be determined from a fit of ( [ poly ] ) to the sampled points ( [ in ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to solve ( [ opess2 ] ) , we approximate the integral by a sum over a discrete set of @xmath60 points , @xmath68 , and write @xmath69 we assume the points to be equidistant with step size @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> a generalization to adaptive step sizes is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> the integral equation ( [ opess2 ] ) then reduces to the set of equations @xmath71 in general , @xmath72 . </S>",

    "<S> singular value decomposition ( svd ) is the method of choice for solving ( [ opess2 ] ) under such conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the mathematical methods described above enable us to obtain the lower moments of the structure function , as well as @xmath88 as a whole , rather accurately from a relatively small set of values of @xmath89 . to demonstrate that , we start from the experimental nonsinglet structure function @xmath90 , which we parameterize by @xmath91   \\label{mstw}\\ ] ] with @xmath92 and @xmath93 taken to be the lo parton distributions at the scale @xmath94  @xcite . from ( [ mstw ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we compute @xmath89 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 using ( [ opess2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig6 ] ) will aspire to .    to compute the moments , we fit the interpolating polynomial ( [ poly ] ) to the lowest five ` data ' points @xmath99 with @xmath100 , which is equivalent to solving the set of linear equations ( [ va ] ) for @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] for the lowest three moments , together with the target numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the first three moments are accurately reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> to retrieve the structure function @xmath90 , we apply the svd ( [ svd ] ) to our ` data '  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three out of nine eigenvalues of @xmath77 turned out to be zero . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we show the result for @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the structure function @xmath103 can be well reproduced from a relatively small set of data , except perhaps for @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained for the singlet structure function @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> we have not made any attempts to optimize the svd . </S>",
    "<S> it can be improved in several respects . a bayesian approach to alleviate overfitting , for example , </S>",
    "<S> might lead to particularly robust results .    </S>",
    "<S> there are other possibilities as well to compute the structure function from the compton amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly promising approach is to fit the moments , for example in the interpolating polynomial ( [ poly ] ) , by an appropriate function @xmath106 with @xmath107 and employ an inverse mellin transform on @xmath106 to obtain @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the moments can be fitted surprisingly well by the simple expression @xmath108 for which the inverse mellin transform is known analytically  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the svd method can be extended to larger values @xmath111 without problem . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to probe the small-@xmath112 region of @xmath88 , which is not accessible through moments of the structure function . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , by extending the calculation to @xmath113 , we were able to retrieve the singlet structure function @xmath114  @xcite down to fractional momenta @xmath115 , which was not possible before . </S>",
    "<S> odd moments of the structure functions can be obtained by also including the local axial vector current @xmath116 to ( [ add ] ) and studying the interference with the vector current . </S>",
    "<S> this is achievable through a simple extension of the procedure described above . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be generalized to nonforward compton scattering as well . that will allow us to derive generalized parton distribution functions ( gpds ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is the question what accuracy can be achieved with real data . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the second derivative of the nucleon energy can be computed rather accurately . in a proof - of - principle study </S>",
    "<S> we have computed ( [ fh ] ) from @xmath117 configurations generated at the su(3 ) symmetric point  @xcite on a @xmath118 lattice with lattice spacing @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> first results are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] , where the contribution from @xmath120 has been subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the precision for lattice momenta @xmath121 and @xmath122 is already quite impressive </S>",
    "<S> . we should be able to improve on the precision of the data at higher momenta by employing ` momentum smearing ' techniques  @xcite , which has not been attempted here . based on this result </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an overall projected error of @xmath123 on the compton amplitude @xmath64 , marked by the shaded area in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , as well as the resulting errors on @xmath124 and @xmath90 , shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , as a conservative estimate . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that the entire structure function , including its moments , can be reconstructed from a lattice calculation of the compton amplitude with unprecedented accuracy , devoid of any renormalization and mixing issues . </S>"
