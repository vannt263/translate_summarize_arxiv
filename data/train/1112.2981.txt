    "the opera observation @xcite of superluminal neutrinos has been ruled out by the measurement by icarus @xcite which puts an upper bound on the superluminality of neutrinos at @xmath3 .",
    "an phenomenological consequence of neutrinos being superluminal was the observation by cohen and glashow ( gc)@xcite and others @xcite that superluminal neutrinos are kinematically allowed to emit pairs of @xmath4 and would thereby lose most of their energy during the cern - gran sasso flight of 730 km @xcite .",
    "icarus experiment @xcite searched for the cerenkov emission of electrons in the same cern - cngs to gran sasso neutrino beams , where according to the gc calculation , @xmath5 of the neutrinos are expected to decay and no anomalous @xmath4 events were detected . using this a much stronger bound @xmath6 can be put on the superluminal neutrinos .",
    "another problem with superluminal neutrinos which has been discussed @xcite is that the change in neutrino energy - momentum relation restricts the phase - space for the @xmath7 process and the pion lifetime would be larger for the opera neutrinos produced by the pion decay from the cern - cngs beam .    in a measurement by minos @xcite it was found that muon neutrinos of average energy 3 gev traversing a distance 730 km exceed @xmath8 by an amount , @xmath9 .",
    "this however is in contrast to the neutrino observations from supernova sn 1987a @xcite where over a flight path of @xmath10 kpc , the neutrinos with energy in the band @xmath11 mev all arrived within a time span of @xmath12 sec and the optical signal arrived after @xmath13 hours of the neutrino signal ( consistent with prediction of supernova models ) from which it is inferred that @xmath14 .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the rates for @xmath4 radiation from neutrinos and pion decay assuming that the neutrinos obey the energy momentum relation of the form @xmath15 .",
    "this is motivated by horava - lifshitz type field theories @xcite where the higher derivative terms break lorentz invariance at high scale but help in removing ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we find that for @xmath1 the bounds on @xmath2 from direct time of flight measurement @xcite are much more stringent than from constraining the cerenkov decay process during the cern to gran - sasso flight of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this is unlike the case for @xmath16 studied by glashow - cohen @xcite and @xcite where the constraint on lorentz violation from the kinematically forbidden processes is more stringent than from the time of flight measurement .",
    "models which explain the opera result of superluminal neutrinos and which have a bearing on the question of cerenkov emission from neutrinos or the pion decay kinematics fall broadly in the following categories :    1 .",
    "deformed lorentz symmetry models @xcite where the dispersion relations change from the usual @xmath17 form to a different form which is still covariant under the modified lorentz transformations . in this picture the processes which are forbidden in one reference frame ( like the rest frame of the massive neutrinos ) will be forbidden also in the lab frame .",
    "lorentz invariance violation as in lifshitz type field theories @xcite , from a gauge singlet susy sector @xcite or a hidden sector@xcite , environmental couplings @xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite , fermi - point splitting @xcite , space - time fluctuations @xcite and string theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we we consider the following general dispersion relation motivated by horava - lifshitz theories @xmath18 where @xmath19 etc .",
    "the difference between the superluminal neutrino velocity and the speed of light ( taken to be 1 ) is then given by @xmath20 the icarus time of flight experiment @xcite has observed neutrinos and the time difference between the neutrino time of flight ( tof ) and the calculated photon tof is @xmath21 for neutrino energy @xmath22 gev and a distance @xmath23 from cern - cngs to the detector in gran sasso .",
    "this corresponds to a neutrino superluminality by the amount @xcite , ( e=12.5gev)= < 2.3 10 ^ -7 [ d17 ] from ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ d17 ] ) we put constraints on @xmath2 from the tof experiment @xcite .",
    "the cerenkov decay constraint comes from the earlier icarus experiment @xcite where the expected number of cc neutrino events is @xmath24 and the observed number is @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to a bound on the decay length @xmath26 of neutrinos given by 0.04 < ( - c /731.2 km ) .",
    "[ cerenkov ] we calculate the neutrino cerenkov decay length @xmath27 using the generalised dispersion relations ( [ disp ] ) and constraint @xmath2 from the experimental bound ( [ cerenkov ] ) .",
