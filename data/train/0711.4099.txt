    "the irac images for each goods field were stacked at the pixel locations corresponding to these @xmath106000 acs sources .",
    "the stacking was undertaken by making 12@xmath25 image cutouts from the masked irac mosaic , centered on each acs source position .",

    "pixels which have been masked do not contribute either flux or exposure in the stacking process .",
    "circular aperture photometry was performed on this stacked image and the flux measured in a 3.6@xmath25 radius beam .",

    "spitzer_. aperture corrections were estimated by performing identical photometry on a calibration point source source and correspond to a factor of 1.14 .",
    "after background subtraction and aperture corrections to the photometry were performed , the resultant stacked 3.6@xmath0 m flux density is 130@xmath21.3 njy .    in order to assess the reliability of the stacked flux , we stacked the irac images at an identical number of positions which are offset from the nominal acs source positions by random amounts , up to 9@xmath25 from the original source coordinates",
    "this has the advantage of accounting for any possible contamination of the stacked flux due to the wings of nearby sources which may not be completely masked , while measuring the same local sky background .",
    "the random stacks were repeated 100 times and the flux of the stack measured .",
    "the standard deviation of these values results in a flux density of 5 njy which is a factor of 4 larger than the uncertainty simply due to the background noise term due to source confusion and the low - level flux from the wings of masked sources .",

    "we note that this estimate is larger than the value obtained by simply multiplying the quoted number of sources ( @xmath106000 ) with the median flux .",
    "this is because the number of sources measurement requires that a source be unmasked out to a radius of 3.6@xmath25 while the exposure map takes into account the exact number of sources which contribute to the stacked flux in each pixel .",
    "since some of the source may be partially masked within the 3.6@xmath25 radius , the number of sources is smaller than the number of sources as estimated from the exposure map .",
    "furthermore , this estimate of 0.12 nw m@xmath5 sr@xmath6 only accounts for sources that remain outside the irac mask and are not confused with bright irac sources . assuming the average flux from the stack also applies to sources affected by the mask",

    "thus , even a qualitative comparison of the stacked flux densities with a typical galaxy sed results in a redshift range similar to what we estimate from the chi - square values .",

    "although the exact redshift distribution of these faint galaxies is not known at this time , it is illustrative to estimate the fraction of the stellar mass density hidden in these objects .",

    "we also measure the clustering of these sources to establish the amplitude of unresolved fluctuations at irac bands . since we are interested in the anisotropy of ir light , to establish the power spectrum of fluctuations , we need the flux distribution within this population .",
    "the stacking analysis only allows us to establish either the total or the average flux of this sample .",
    "this forces us to make an estimate of the flux distribution and use that to predict clustering of unresolved fluctuations produced by these sources .",
    "the angular power spectrum of ir fluxes associated with these sources is determined using the same technique as described in sullivan et al .",
    "we account for the flux distribution by randomly assigning ir flux to the @xmath10 6000 optical source locations between 70 njy and 700 njy such that the total flux assigned is the same as the total flux measured for these sources from the stack .",
    "we assign fluxes such that the number counts trace the extrapolated slope from known irac counts down to @xmath60 of 24.7 mag .",
    "given the uncertainty in the faint - end slope , we take the slope @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) to be either 0.6 or 0.0 .",
    "we tested how our predictions change with variations to these parameters and found consistent results within errors .",
    "since the flux assignment is random , to get an average of the expected clustering , we randomize the assignments and the fluxes and use a monte - carlo approach to obtain the mean and variance of clustering .",
    "we summarize our results in figure  3 , where we also compare with a direct measurement of the clustering of ir fluctuations and expectations based on the clustering models of sullivan et al .",
    "( 2007 ; solid lines ) . in figure  3",
    ", we also show the ir fluctuation spectrum when the faint optical sources that we stack on are masked from the irac image with open squares ( cooray et al .",
    "the solid squares show the revised measurement after correcting for a bias associated with the window function introduced by the large mask . to understand this correction noted in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , we note that the fluctuation spectrum measurable in fourier ( multipole ) space in the presence of a mask is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the window function associated with the mask and @xmath65 is the power spectrum of interest .",
    "we recover the latter with measurements of @xmath66 by first generating @xmath67 associated with our mask ( appendix a of hivon et al .",
    "2002 ) and then iteratively inverting for @xmath68 using an inversion similar to dodelson & gaztaaga ( 2000 ) . the inversion agrees to 10% with a separate estimate of the angular power spectrum using a likelihood method where one maximizes the likelihood of an estimated @xmath69 with a model spectrum @xmath70 using @xmath71 given the measurements @xmath66 and the error @xmath72 .",
    "this procedure can be described as minimizing the @xmath73 with @xmath74 .    as shown in figure  3 ,",
    "the difference between the fluctuation amplitude of unresolved ir fluctuations and the fluctuation amplitude with acs sources masked is about a factor of 2 ( @xmath2 0.6 ) at @xmath75 .",
    "our measurements then suggest that , from this difference , up to 50% of ir fluctuations can be accounted by faint acs sources",
    ". it could be that by accounting for further fainter optically sources , this fraction can be increased , but it is quite unlikely that 100% of ir fluctuations reported in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007b ) are generated by @xmath13 galaxies hosting mostly pop  iii stars that are optically invisible .",
    "the difference between ir fluctuations with and without acs sources masked must be reproduced by the clustering of ir light produced by the same acs sources . with flux assignments based on the stacking analysis",
    ", we find that the difference is reproduced ( though these indirect estimates of the expected clustering ir fluctuations produced by faint acs sources are uncertain due to uncertainties in the flux distribution ) .",
    "we conclude that irrespective of whether we measure the power spectrum in the irb fluctuations after masking optical sources or whether we measure the power spectrum of faint optical galaxies with an average flux based on our stacking analysis , we find that the power in faint ( @xmath1 mag ) , @xmath9 , galaxies accounts for at least @xmath1030@xmath7650% of the power in the ir background fluctuations on angular scales of @xmath104@xmath21 , where the measurement is not strongly sensitive to cosmic variance .    on similar angular scales ,",
