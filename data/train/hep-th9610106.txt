    "if superstring theory is relevant to nature , it must contain the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions as part of its low energy ( _ i.e. _ , below the string scale ) effective field theory @xcite .",
    "there are a number of possibilities @xcite of embedding the standard model in superstring .",
    "one elegant way of realizing such an embedding is via a grand unified theory(gut ) . since gut is a truly unified theory with one gauge coupling in the low energy effective theory , one may argue that it is the most appealing possibility .",
    "various guts in string theory have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "since nature seems to have only three light families of quarks and leptons , it is reasonable , and perhaps even desirable , to construct superstring models that contain @xmath0-family guts . in earlier papers @xcite ,",
    "we have considered explicit realization of such @xmath0-family guts in the heterotic string theory .",
    "the number of such possibilities turns out to be quite limited . in this paper , we present a classification of @xmath0-family @xmath1 and @xmath2 grand unification heterotic string models , within the framework of perturbative string theory , as described below . the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 cases will be described in a separate paper .    for the grand unified gauge group to break spontaneously to the standard model in the low energy effective field theory",
    ", we need an adjoint ( or other appropriate representation ) higgs field in the massless spectrum . in string theory",
    ", it is most natural to have space - time supersymmetry , which we will also impose .",
    "since nature is not explicitly supersymmetric , supersymmetry must be broken .",
    "the generally accepted way of achieving this is via dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector , which is then transmitted to the observable sector via interactions with gravity or other messenger / intermediate sector @xcite .",
    "dynamical supersymmetry breaking via gaugino condensate requires an asymptotically - free hidden sector . motivated by these considerations",
    ", we will impose the following constraints on grand unified string model - building : + ( _ i _ ) @xmath14 space - time supersymmetry ; + ( _ ii _ ) three chiral families of fermions in the gut gauge group ; + ( _ iii _ ) adjoint ( and/or other appropriate ) higgs fields in gut ; + ( _ iv _ ) non - abelian hidden sector .",
    "+ imposing these four constraints on model - building , within the framework of conformal field theory and asymmetric orbifolds , we argue that we need only consider @xmath3 asymmetric orbifolds that include a @xmath4 outer - automorphism .",
    "so the classification problem is reduced to the classification of such @xmath3 asymmetric orbifold models that have the above properties .",
    "this is carried out in this paper .",
    "it turns out that all the @xmath0-family @xmath1 and @xmath2 models have the following properties : + @xmath15 one adjoint ( plus some lower representation ) higgs field(s ) in the gut group ; + @xmath15 an intermediate / horizontal gauge symmetry .",
    "this classification yields two types of models : + ( _ i _ ) a unique @xmath16 model , where the subscripts indicate the levels of the respective current algebras .",
    "this model has @xmath6 left - handed and @xmath7 right - handed @xmath8s , _",
    "i.e. _ , 3 chiral families , and one higgs superfield .",
    "the @xmath17 form its hidden sector .",
    "however , none of these three @xmath9s is asymptotically - free at the string scale .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) a unique @xmath18 model , which lies in the same moduli space with a set of other @xmath1 models . in this sense , we should consider this as one model .",
    "all the models have @xmath10 left - handed and @xmath11 right - handed families .",
    "some of the points in this moduli space can be reached directly via the asymmetric orbifold construction .",
    "the set of @xmath1 models obtainable this way consists of 4 subsets : + @xmath15 4 models with @xmath19 ; + @xmath15 4 models with @xmath20 ; + @xmath15 4 models with @xmath21 ; + @xmath15 4 models with @xmath22 .",
    "+ although the 4 models in each subset have the same gauge symmetry , they are distinguished from each other by their massless spectra .",
    "all the massless particles with @xmath1 quantum numbers are singlets under @xmath23 , _",
    "i.e. _ , this @xmath23 plays the role of a hidden sector . in each of these 4 subsets ,",
    "this @xmath23 in 2 of the 4 models is asymptotically - free , while it is not asymptotically - free in the other 2 , at least at the string scale .",
    "( the @xmath23 hidden sector of the @xmath2 model is also asymptotically - free . )",
    "the @xmath24 in the first subset is not asymptotically - free at the string scale , and it plays the role of a horizontal symmetry .",
    "it also plays the role of an intermediate / messenger / mediator sector .",
    "each model in the third subset can be obtained from the corresponding model in either the first or the second subset via appropriate spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "similarly , each model in the fourth subset can be obtained from the corresponding model in the third subset via appropriate spontaneous symmetry breaking . in this sense",
    ", one may prefer not to count the third and the fourth subsets of models as independent models . since these are flat directions , it is not hard to see that they are all connected in the same moduli space .",
    "the @xmath2 and some of these @xmath1 models were constructed earlier @xcite .",
    "note that , at the string scale , this hidden @xmath23 coupling @xmath25 is three times that of the grand unified gauge group .",
    "using the accepted grand unified gauge coupling extracted from experiments , the @xmath23 coupling is expected to become strong at a scale above the electroweak scale .",
    "naively , gaugino condensation in the hidden sector will not stabilize the dilaton expectation value to some finite reasonable value @xcite , implying that these models may not be phenomenologically viable .",
    "however , recent ideas on the khler potential actually suggest otherwise @xcite .",
    "so the issue remains open .",
    "clearly a better understanding of the string dynamics will be most important .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the the general grounds underlying the classification of models .",
    "next , we turn to the construction of the models , which involves two steps . first , the appropriate @xmath26 supersymmetric models , namely the narain models , are constructed in section iii .",
    "then , appropriate asymmetric @xmath3 orbifolds of the narain models that yield the various @xmath0-family string gut models are classified in section iv .",
    "the massless spectra of the resulting @xmath14 models may be worked out using the approach given in ref @xcite .",
    "appendix a gives a brief introduction to the construction .",
    "the models and their massless spectra are listed in the collection of tables . in section",
    "v we discuss the moduli space of the models and the ways they are connected to each other .",
    "this is done in two steps to make the discussion easier to follow .",
    "first , we describe these connections in terms of the flat directions of the scalar fields in effective field theory",
    ". then we do the same in terms of the string moduli , and translate the field theory discussion into the stringy language . finally , in section",
    "vi we conclude with some remarks .",
    "appendix b contains some details .",
    "before the classification and the explicit construction of @xmath0-family gut string models , we begin by outlining the general grounds under the classification .",
    "( _ i _ ) phenomenologically , the gauge coupling at the grand unification scale is weak .",
    "since this scale is quite close to the string scale , the coupling at the string scale is also expected to be weak .",
    "this means that string model construction is governed by the underlying conformal field theory .",
    "so model - building can be restricted to the four - dimensional heterotic string theory using conformal field theories and current ( or kac - moody ) algebras .",
    "our framework throughout will be the asymmetric orbifold construction @xcite . in working out the spectra of such models based on asymmetric orbifolds ,",
    "the rules of ref.@xcite are very useful .",
    "( _ ii _ ) by the three chiral families constraint , we mean that the net number of chiral families ( defined as the number of left - handed families minus the number of the right - handed families ) must be three .",
    "the remaining pairs may be considered to be higgs superfields .",
    "of course , there is no guarantee that any right - handed families present will always pair up with left - handed families to become heavy .",
    "this depends on the details of dynamics .",
    "( _ iii _ ) as we mentioned earlier , the hidden sector is required so that dynamical supersymmetry breaking may occur ( although it still depends on the details of string dynamics whether supersymmetry is broken or not ) .",
    "this means the hidden sector must become strongly interacting at some scale above the electroweak scale , which in turn implies that the hidden sector must be asymptotically - free .",
    "here we only impose the condition that the hidden sector must be non - abelian .",
    "this is not quite as strong as the asymptotically - free condition , since , with enough matter fields , a non - abelian gauge symmetry need not be asymptotically - free .",
    "however , depending on the details of the string dynamics , it is possible that , although not asymptotically - free at the string scale , the hidden sector can become asymptotically - free below some lower scale where some of its matter fields acquire masses .",
    "( _ iv _ ) let us now turn to the requirement of adjoint higgs in gut . in the low energy",
    "effective theory with a grand unification gauge symmetry , it is well known that an adjoint ( or other appropriate higher dimensional representation ) higgs field is needed to break the grand unified gauge group to the standard model .",
    "it is relatively easy to realize gauge symmetries with level-@xmath7 current algebras in string theory .",
    "unfortunately , such models can not have @xmath14 supersymmetry , chiral fermions and adjoint ( or higher dimensional ) higgs field all at the same time .",
    "this is due to the following .",
    "level-1 current algebras do not have adjoint ( or higher dimensional ) irreducible representations ( irreps ) coming from its conformal highest weight since the latter are not compatible with unitarity .",
    "thus , the only way an adjoint higgs can appear in the massless spectrum is that it comes from the identity irrep ( the first descendent of the identity weight is the adjoint , other higher irreps are massive ) , the same way the gauge supermultiplet ( which also transforms in the adjoint ) appears in the massless spectrum . since there is no distinction between the gauge quantum numbers of the gauge and adjoint higgs supermultiplets , they ultimately combine into an @xmath27 gauge supermultiplet , and all the fields transforming in the irreps of this gauge group turn out to have @xmath27 global supersymmetry .",
    "this necessarily implies that the fermions are non - chiral .",
    "so one can not construct a string model with both chiral fermions and adjoint higgs using level-@xmath7 current algebras .",
    "for the same reason of unitarity ( as mentioned above ) , massless higgs in irreps higher than the adjoint can not appear in level-1 models .",
    "the above discussion leads one to conclude that , in order to incorporate both chiral fermions and adjoint ( or higher dimensional representation ) higgs fields , the grand unified gauge symmetry must be realized via a higher - level current algebra .",
    "indeed , adjoint ( and some higher dimensional ) irreps are allowed by unitarity in these higher - level realizations .",
    "this means that one can hope to construct models with adjoint higgs which comes from the adjoint irrep rather than from the identity irrep .",
    "since now the adjoint higgs and gauge supermultiplet come from two different irreps of the current algebra , they no longer combine into an @xmath27 gauge supermultiplet , and chiral fermions become possible .",
    "one could also hope to construct models with higgs fields in higher dimensional irreps .",
    "level-2 string models , _",
    "i.e. _ , string model with the grand unified gauge symmetry realized via a level-2 current algebra , have been extensively explored in the literature @xcite . so far , all the known level-2 models have an even number of chiral families .",
    "although there is no formal proof that three - family models based on level-@xmath11 current algebras do not exist , there is a simple way to understand the failure to construct them , at least in the orbifold framework .",
    "level-2 models typically require @xmath28 ( outer - automorphism ) orbifolds .",
    "the number of fixed points of such an orbifold is always even , typically powers of 2 .",
    "since this number determines the number of chiral families , one ends up with an even number of chiral families .",
    "one possible way to obtain @xmath0 families is to have three different twisted sectors where each contributes only one ( _ i.e. _ , 2 to the zeroth power ) family .",
    "in fact , this is the approach used to construct interesting @xmath0-family standard models @xcite .",
    "however , rather exhaustive searches@xcite seem to rule out this possibility for gut string models : there is simply not enough room to incorporate these different sectors , simply because the level-@xmath11 gut group takes up more room than the standard model .",
    "thus , to achieve @xmath0 chiral families , it is natural to go to level-3 models , since their construction typically requires a @xmath4 outer - automorphism .",
    "this can be part of a @xmath4 orbifold , which has an odd number of fixed points .",
    "so there is a chance to construct models with three chiral families via @xmath4 orbifolds . since @xmath29 orbifolds involve an even number of fixed points , level-4 models are likely to share the same fate of their level-2 counterparts",
    "now , higher level current algebras have larger central charges .",
    "since the total central charge is 22 , a string model with higher - level current algebras will have less room for the hidden sector . in the level-@xmath0 @xmath1 or @xmath2 models",
    "presented in this paper , a typical hidden sector has an @xmath9 as its non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "this indicates that level-4 and higher level models will not have any room for a non - abelian hidden sector .",
    "in fact , it is not at all clear that level-4 models can even be constructed .",
    "thus , level-@xmath0 models seem to be the only possibility .",
    "naively , one might expect that three - family string guts can be constructed with a single @xmath4 twist , since the latter can , at least in principle , be arranged to have three fixed points .",
    "this , however , turns out not to be the case .",
    "it can be shown ( by considering all the possible @xmath4 twists compatible with the following requirements ) that if a model with @xmath1 or @xmath2 gauge group realized at level-3 is constructed by a single @xmath4 orbifold of an @xmath26 narain lattice , then one of the following happens ( see appendix b for more details ) : + @xmath15 the model has @xmath14 susy , but no chiral fermions ; + @xmath15 the model has @xmath14 susy , and chiral fermions ; then the number of chiral families is always 9 , with no anti - generations ( _ i.e. _ , 9 left - handed families and no right - handed families ) ; + @xmath15 the model has @xmath27 susy , and thus no chiral fermions .",
    "since the first case is already a non - chiral @xmath14 model to start with , its @xmath28 orbifold can not yield an odd number of chiral families ( see appendix b for details ) .",
    "this implies that , to obtain a model with three chiral families , we must start from one of the last two cases just described and @xmath28 orbifold it .",
    "these are the only possibilities since @xmath28 is the only other symmetry that a narain @xmath30 lattice@xcite can have and at the same time satisfy other requirements like , say , @xmath31 gauge symmetry . here",
    "we should mention that the resulting orbifold must be @xmath32 , and it can not be a non - abelian discrete group such as , say , @xmath33 .",
    "this is because there is only one embedding of @xmath34 and @xmath35 current algebras ( with the subscripts indicating the levels of the current algebras ) in the narain lattice , namely , the diagonal embedding @xcite , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 groups are the diagonal subgroups of @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "the diagonal subgroup is invariant under the outer - automorphism of the three @xmath1s or the three @xmath37s .",
    "this outer - automorphism is isomorphic to a @xmath4 twist .",
    "thus , if the subsequent @xmath28 twist does not commute with the @xmath4 twist , the gauge group will be further broken , and the rank will be reduced .",
    "this is why the @xmath28 twist must commute with the @xmath4 twist .",
    "this leads us to a classification of all @xmath3 asymmetric orbifolds that lead to gut models with three chiral families of fermions .",
    "since it has been shown@xcite that only diagonal embedding is available for @xmath34 and @xmath2 , @xmath4 orbifolds will be able to reach all such models .",
    "the above discussion reduces the classification problem to the classification of @xmath3 asymmetric orbifold models with the following phenomenological requirements ( that translate into stringent constraints in the actual string model building ) that we will impose : + @xmath15 @xmath14 space - time supersymmetry ; + @xmath15 level-3 gut ; + @xmath15 three chiral families in gut ; + @xmath15 non - abelian hidden sector .",
    "+ imposing these minimal phenomenological requirements , we find the unique @xmath2 model and its accompanying @xmath1 models , and the single @xmath1 model .",
    "this classification automatically includes the 3-family models constructed earlier @xcite .",
    "all of the models are given in this paper and their massless spectra are presented in the tables . in ref @xcite , details of the construction are provided .",
    "appendix a gives a brief outline .",
    "since the constructions of all the models are very similar , our discussion here will be quite brief .",
    "now the classification project consists of three steps : + ( _ i _ ) list all suitable @xmath26 narain models @xcite ; + ( _ ii _ ) list all @xmath3 asymmetric twists / shifts that can act on each narain model ; + ( _ iii _ ) work out the massless spectrum in each orbifold .",
    "+ now , it is well - known that some orbifolds , though look different at first sight , nevertheless yield identical models .",
    "there are two situations to be considered : + @xmath15 their spectra in each twisted / untwisted sector are identical .",
    "examples of such equivalent orbifolds have been discussed in some detail in ref @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall not discuss this situation further , but simply consider one choice in each set of equivalent @xmath3 asymmetric twists / shifts .",
    "+ @xmath15 their massless spectra are identical , but some particular massless particles may appear in different sectors in different orbifolds .",
    "since this situation is not discussed in ref @xcite , we shall give the equivalent @xmath3 twists / shifts in this paper .",
    "these models are simply related by @xmath38-duality .",
    "we should point out that the classification only distinguishes different string models by their tree - level massless spectra and/or interactions .",
    "for example , a typical model will have some moduli that can be varied ( within some ranges ) without affecting its massless spectrum . here",
    "we shall not distinguish such models .",
    "we will , however , give a rather detailed discussion of the moduli space in which these models sit .",
    "this explains our emphasis on the enhanced symmetry points in the moduli space .",
    "if we move away from those special points in the moduli space , one of the following happens : + @xmath15 the resulting model has the same tree - level massless spectrum but the couplings are continuously varied : + @xmath15 the resulting model exists , but part of its gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken : in particular , it may happen that the hidden sector is broken .",
    "let us summarize some of the key features of these models .",
    "each model has a gauge symmetry @xmath39 , where the observable sector @xmath40 is either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath41 is the hidden sector gauge symmetry : massless @xmath40 supermultiplets are by definition singlets in @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining gauge symmetry is referred to as @xmath42 .",
    "both massless @xmath40 supermultiplets and massless @xmath41 supermultiplets can have non - zero quantum numbers in @xmath42 .",
    "if massless @xmath41 supermultiplets are singlets under certain part of @xmath42 , that part of @xmath42 may be considered as a horizontal symmetry .",
    "the rest of @xmath42 may be considered as the gauge group for the messenger / mediator sector , linking the hidden and the visible sectors . in our classification , @xmath42 is always composed of some factors of @xmath43s and sometimes a ( non - asymptotically - free ) @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to some of the @xmath12 models @xcite , all the @xmath43s in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models are anomaly - free .",
    "also note that some of the models do not have gauge singlets completely neutral under all gauge symmetries .",
    "each model has only one adjoint ( but no higher representation ) higgs field in the grand unified gauge group .",
    "they also have higgs fields in lower representations .",
    "there are two types of @xmath1 models .",
    "there is one unique @xmath1 model with @xmath44 as its hidden sector , but none of these three @xmath9s is asymptotically - free at the string scale .",
    "this @xmath1 model has @xmath6 left - handed and @xmath7 right - handed @xmath8s , _",
    "i.e. _ , 3 chiral families and 1 higgs superfield in the spinor representation . in all the @xmath1 models ,",
    "each @xmath8 ( left or right - handed ) is accompanied by a @xmath45 and a @xmath46 .",
    "the other type consists of the unique @xmath2 model and a set of @xmath1 models .",
    "the hidden sector in the unique @xmath2 model and its accompanying @xmath1 models is @xmath23 , which is asymptotically - free at the string scale for some models , but not for others .",
    "the @xmath2 model has @xmath10 left - handed and @xmath11 right - handed @xmath47s .",
    "these @xmath1 models have @xmath10 left - handed and @xmath11 right - handed @xmath8s .",
    "this means that they have 3 chiral families and two higgs superfields in the fundamental or spinor representation .",
    "ignoring string threshold effects @xcite , the gauge coupling of a given group @xmath40 in the model at a scale @xmath48 below the string scale @xmath49 is related to it via : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the level of the gauge group . for @xmath43 gauge symmetries , let us introduce the following convention .",
    "demanding that all particles have integer @xmath43 charges , the level of a @xmath43 gauge symmetry is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the compactification radius of the corresponding left - moving world - sheet boson .",
    "the @xmath43 charge of a particle with charge @xmath54 contributes @xmath55 to its conformal highest weight .",
    "( alternatively , if we choose to define the level of all @xmath43 gauge symmetry to be @xmath56 , then that @xmath43 charge of the particle will be @xmath57 . )",
    "the constant @xmath58 is the one - loop coefficient of the beta - function .",
    "note that at the string scale , the hidden @xmath23 coupling @xmath25 is three times that of the grand unified gauge group .",
    "now , @xmath59 gauge symmetry may be obtained via a diagonal embedding in @xmath60 as well as a non - diagonal embedding @xcite in @xmath61 ; so its classification requires additional consideration .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 models allow a hidden sector with an asymptotically - free semi - simple gauge group at the string scale ; this important phenomenological feature is absent in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 models .",
    "as we have seen in ref@xcite , @xmath13 models are closely related to the @xmath12 construction , so their classification should go together . the classification of @xmath12 and @xmath13 models with 3 chiral families will be presented separately .",
    "starting from a consistent heterotic string model , typically a narain model , a new model can be generated by performing a consistent set of twists and shifts ( of the momentum lattices ) on it .",
    "first , these twists and shifts must be consistent with the lattice symmetry . to obtain a new consistent string model ,",
    "the following conditions are imposed on its one - loop partition function in the light - cone gauge : + ( @xmath62 ) one - loop modular invariance ; + ( @xmath63 ) world - sheet supersymmetry , which insures space - time lorentz invariance in the covariant gauge ; and + ( @xmath64 ) the physically sensible projection ; this means the contribution of a space - time fermionic ( bosonic ) degree of freedom to the partition function counts as minus ( plus ) one . in all cases that can be checked , this condition plus",
    "the one - loop modular invariance and factorization imply multi - loop modular invariance .",
    "a set of twists and shifts can be organized into a set of vectors .",
    "the rules of consistent asymmetric orbifold model construction can then be written as constraints on these vectors , as done in ref@xcite .",
    "all sets of vectors given in this and the next sections , @xmath65 , the wilson lines @xmath66 , and the @xmath3 orbifolds @xmath67 , have been checked to satisfy these consistency constraints .",
    "the spectrum of the resulting model can be obtained from the spectrum generating formula .",
    "a brief outline can be found in appendix a.    before we list the twists and shifts that generate the orbifold models , we have to construct the narain lattices that we are going to orbifold .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "first , we describe the @xmath26 narain model that is obtained by compactifying the @xmath68 heterotic string theory on a six - torus .",

    "@xmath3 orbifolds of these models will then give rise to the @xmath34 and @xmath35 models with three families of chiral fermions .",
    "consider the narain model with the momenta of the internal bosons spanning an even self - dual lorentzian lattice @xmath69 . here",

    "next , we discuss the wilson lines that will give the narain models with @xmath31 and @xmath36 gauge subgroups . here",
    "we are writing the wilson lines as shift vectors in the @xmath30 lattice . the shift vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 to be introduced are order-@xmath11 shifts that break the @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "this will be the generic case , although sometimes , the new @xmath110 sectors can introduce additional gauge bosons to enhance @xmath31 to @xmath36 .",

    "here , we point out that all but the unique @xmath1 model classified in this paper are connected by ( classically ) flat moduli . in section iii , the moduli space of the @xmath26 supersymmetric models is discussed . that moduli space provides an underlying structure to the moduli space for the orbifold models constructed . in subsection a here , we give a discussion of these flat directions in the language of effective field theory .",
    "in particular , we identify the massless scalar fields in these models whose vevs correspond to these flat moduli . in subsection b",
    ", we give a stringy description of this moduli space .",
    "1 . summarizes the discussion in this section .",
    "let us study the effective field theory limit of the string models we have constructed .",
    "there are scalar fields in the massless spectra of these models , and some of them correspond to flat directions . in our following discussion",
    "we implicitly use our convention , which was mentioned in the introduction , for distinguishing different models .",
    "the two models are considered to be the same if their tree - level massless spectra and/or interactions are the same .",
    "thus , when connecting different models with flat moduli we do not have to worry about the precise matching of the corresponding heavy string states ( generically they will not match , but there will be a point in the moduli space where the matching will be exact ; then the corresponding models are connected via this point , and the massless spectra for continuously many models could be the same while the massive spectra are not ; an example of this will be given in the next subsection ) .    thus , consider fig .",
    "we have already identified the pairs of models that are the same ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath248 ; see section iv for details ) . the symbols @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 stand for the fields whose vevs are the corresponding flat directions .",
    "thus , @xmath251 is the triplet higgs ( _ i.e. _ , ( @xmath254 ) of the @xmath24 subgroup in models @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 . upon giving this field a vev in the direction corresponding to breaking @xmath257 ,",

    "note that in a similar fashion we could connect some models with , say , @xmath12 gauge symmetry to the models classified in this paper .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the remaining flat directions shown in fig .",
    "1 . the field @xmath250 is a doublet of @xmath24 charged under the corresponding @xmath43 in models @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath261 in the @xmath203 model ) . upon giving this field a vev ,",
    "the gauge subgroup @xmath262 breaks down to @xmath43 ( the latter is a mixture of the original @xmath9 and @xmath43 ) , and the corresponding models can be read off from fig .",
    "1 . if a field @xmath252 gets a vev in models @xmath255 ,",
    "@xmath256 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( in these models @xmath252 is @xmath263 ) , the @xmath264 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath265 , and the corresponding models do not have a hidden sector . finally , the fields @xmath249 in the @xmath266 models ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath267 in the @xmath184 model ) are singlets charged under corresponding @xmath43s , so that upon acquiring a vev , the @xmath43 gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "the above description of these models in terms of the moduli space is useful in the sense that certain conclusions can be made for all of these models at once .",
    "thus , let us for a moment ignore the string threshold corrections and possible stringy non - perturbative effects .",
    "then we can analyze these models in the field theory context .",
    "the dynamics of the hidden sector then is determined by the number of doublets of the @xmath23 hidden sector .",
    "the hidden sector is asymptotically - free only for the points in the moduli space where the number of doublets is less than 12 ( this would correspond to 6 `` flavors '' ) .",
    "there are only 9 such models , namely , @xmath173 , @xmath182 , @xmath203 , @xmath205 , and @xmath268 .",
    "the first two models , namely , @xmath173 and @xmath182 have 2 doublets , which corresponds to 1 `` flavor '' . in the case of models",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath205 , and @xmath268 we have 6 doublets , corresponding to 3 `` flavors '' .    finally , we comment on the @xmath269 model .",
    "this model does not seem to be connected to the other 17 models considered in this paper in any simple way .",
    "this can be readily seen from the fact that the structure of generations in the @xmath269 model is different from that of the rest of the models .",
    "such a connection would involve breaking the hidden sector , so the corresponding models ( via which the connection is possible ) would not be in our classification .",
    "the above discussion is carried out in the language of the low energy effective field theory .",
    "if there are flat directions that can be described as vevs of the corresponding scalars , there must be a string theory description for them as well . in practice , however , finding such a description explicitly may be involved , especially in complicated models such as those classified in this paper . here",
    "we give an example of such a description in the case of our models .",
    "let us start from the narain model @xmath270 , @xmath271 ( see section iii for details ) and turn on the following wilson lines : @xmath272 here @xmath273    let @xmath274 be the corresponding narain model .",

    "now let us start from the @xmath274 model and perform the same twists as in the @xmath184 model ( see section iv for details ) .",
    "the corresponding model depends on the value of the modulus @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath279 we have the @xmath184 model .",
    "for @xmath151 we have the @xmath203 model .",
    "for @xmath193 the resulting model has the massless spectrum which is the same as that of the @xmath186 model .",
    "thus these three models are indeed connected by a continuous parameter @xmath78 . in the previous subsection we described this modulus as vev of the corresponding scalar fields in the effective field theory language .",
    "in this paper we have given a classification of @xmath0-family @xmath1 and @xmath2 grand unified models in string theory within the framework of conformal field theory and asymmetric orbifolds .",
    "is it possible that our classification does not exhaust all such models that can be constructed within conformal field theory ?",
    "this could happen if some @xmath280 calabi - yau compactifications can give @xmath0-family @xmath1 and @xmath2 models and yet not be connected to our models ( which in turn are certain singular points in the moduli space of @xmath280 calabi - yau compactifications ) by a modulus ( _ e.g. _ , this could happen if , in order to connect these models , one has to pass through certain singularities ) .",
    "however , level-3 @xmath1 and @xmath2 kac - moody algebras only have diagonal embedding , corresponding to precisely modding out by a @xmath4 outer - automorphism .",
    "so , this implies that our list exhausts all the possible models of this type that admit free field realization .",
    "we also pointed out that , say , level-4 @xmath1 models are very likely to have even numbers of chiral families , and that there is no room for the hidden sector in such models .",
    "this is true for the embedding @xmath281 , although to the best of our knowledge there have been no previous attempts to construct such models in the literature",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this particular avenue since higher - level @xmath1 kac - moody algebras ( as well as @xmath2 kac - moody algebras at levels higher than 3 ) do not appear to have embeddings in the corresponding level-1 algebras with central charges less than or equal 22 .",
    "there is another possibility : @xmath282 .",
    "unfortunately , this embedding does not seem to have a simple orbifold realization , at least not a @xmath4 orbifold realization , so it remains an open question if such models can be constructed .",
    "even if such a model can be constructed , it will not have the @xmath4 structure needed for three families .",

    "in this appendix , let us give a brief outline / introduction to some of the key elements in the construction of asymmetric orbifold models , and a few illustrations on how to obtain the massless spectra . starting from an @xmath26 narain model ,",
    "a new model can be generated by performing a consistent set of twists and shifts ( of the momentum lattice ) on it .",
    "these twists and shifts must be consistent with the lattice symmetry .",
    "the rules of consistent asymmetric orbifold model construction can then be written as constraints on them , as done in ref@xcite .",
    "these constraints follow from the one - loop modular invariance , world - sheet supersymmetry , and the physically sensible projection conditions .",
    "all sets of shifts and twists given in the text , @xmath65 , the wilson lines @xmath66 , and the @xmath3 orbifolds @xmath67 , have been checked to satisfy these consistency constraints .    in principle",
    ", the spectrum of the resulting model can be obtained from the spectrum generating formula@xcite . in some cases ,",
    "parts of the massless spectrum can be obtained by imposing only the level - matching condition and the anomaly - free condition .",
    "although this approach is simple , it does not yield all the discrete quantum numbers of the particles , which are important for couplings .",
    "for these properties , one should go back to the spectrum generating formula .",
    "sometimes , the identification of the quantum numbers of the particles can be quite non - trivial .",
    "fortunately , whenever this happens , we are able to find an alternative construction of the same model where those particles are clearly identified .",
    "this provides powerful checks .",
    "the constructions of all the models are very similar . to be explicit , let us illustrate the steps with the construction of the @xmath203 model",
    ". we shall start with the n=4 supersymmetric narain model with the @xmath283 gauge symmetry .",
    "here , the gauge symmetry @xmath284 comes from the @xmath285 compactified dimensions .",
    "this model corresponds to the point @xmath105 in the moduli space discussed in section iii , @xmath65 , @xmath286 .",
    "the following wilson lines are introduced to act on this model , @xmath287 the first three entries correspond to the right - moving complex world - sheet bosons .",
    "the next three entries correspond to the left - moving complex world - sheet bosons .",
    "together they form the six - torus . here",
    "the four component vectors @xmath155 and @xmath288 are the spinor @xmath156 and conjugate @xmath157 weights of @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "the remaining 16 left - moving world - sheet bosons generate the @xmath68 lattice .",
    "the @xmath108 shifts are given in the @xmath109 basis .",
    "in this basis , @xmath117(@xmath289 ) stands for the null vector , @xmath118(@xmath119 ) is the vector weight , whereas @xmath120(@xmath121 ) and @xmath122(@xmath123 ) are the spinor and anti - spinor weights of @xmath1(@xmath124 ) .",
    "( for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . ) under @xmath169 , we have @xmath290 since this @xmath66 set involves shifts only ( @xmath65 , no twist ) , the resulting model still has @xmath26 supersymmetry . the states in the original model that will remain in the new model are those that are invariant under these shifts . of the original ones ,",
    "the @xmath291 gauge bosons remain untouched , since there is no shift on their momentum lattices . to see what happens to the @xmath108 gauge symmetry , it is convenient to consider @xmath108 weights in terms of @xmath109 weights .",
    "the @xmath109 gauge bosons come from the @xmath292 weight lattice in eq .",
    "( [ aa1 ] ) and the cartan generators , while the last @xmath293 terms in eq .",
    "( [ aa1 ] ) yields the remaining gauge bosons of @xmath108 .",
    "since massless states coming from these last @xmath293 terms are not invariant under the shift vectors @xmath66 , they are projected out .",
    "so the resulting gauge symmetry of this new model is @xmath159 .",
    "this truncated model is no longer a consistent string model . to restore string consistency , the vectors @xmath66 introduce new sectors ( namely , the @xmath106 , the @xmath107 and the @xmath294 sectors ) of particles ( but they do not introduce new gauge bosons ) .",
    "together , they yield the new narain model , to be called the @xmath153 model .    next we can perform a @xmath3 orbifold on the above @xmath153 model .",
    "it is easier to follow the construction by decomposing the @xmath3 orbifold into a @xmath4 twist and a @xmath28 twist : @xmath295 each @xmath164 in @xmath175 is a @xmath4 twist ( that is , a @xmath296 rotation ) that acts only on a complex world - sheet boson .",
    "so the first @xmath164 acts on the right - moving part of the @xmath297 ( @xmath65 , the @xmath82 ) lattice and the corresponding oscillator excitations , while the left - moving part is untouched .",
    "this is an asymmetric orbifold .",
    "the @xmath298 ( @xmath65 , the @xmath211 ) lattice is twisted symmetrically by the @xmath299 @xmath164 twist .",
    "the three @xmath1s are permuted by the action of the @xmath4 outer - automorphism twist @xmath168 : @xmath300 , where the real bosons @xmath301 , @xmath302 , correspond to the @xmath303 @xmath1 subgroup , @xmath304 .",
    "we can define new bosons @xmath305 ; the other ten real bosons are complexified via linear combinations @xmath306 and @xmath307 , where @xmath308 . under @xmath168",
    ", @xmath309 is invariant , while @xmath310 ( @xmath311 ) are eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath312 ( @xmath313 ) .",
    "finally , string consistency requires the inclusion of the @xmath314 shift in the @xmath124 lattice .",
    "this simply changes the radius of this left - moving world - sheet boson .",
    "notice that all states in the untwisted sector of the @xmath203 model must be invariant under the @xmath175 and @xmath179 twists .",
    "however , they need not be invariant under the @xmath4 outer - automorphism alone . the only states that must be invariant under the @xmath4 outer - automorphism are the states that are already invariant under other parts of the @xmath175 twist .",
    "these include the grand unified gauge bosons .",
    "so , out of the @xmath31 gauge bosons , only the states that are invariant under the @xmath4 outer - automorphism are kept .",
    "they yield the @xmath34 .    the model that results from twisting by the above @xmath175 twist has @xmath14 space - time supersymmetry .",
    "this can be easily seen by counting the number of gravitinos .",
    "this counting depends only on the right - movers , which is identical to the original symmetric orbifold model @xcite .",
    "all the gauge bosons come from the untwisted sector , and the gauge group is @xmath315 .",
    "the twisted sectors give rise to chiral matter fields of @xmath34 .",
    "the asymmetric @xmath4 twist @xmath316 in @xmath297 contributes only a factor of @xmath7 to the number of fixed points as the factor @xmath0 contributed by its right mover is cancelled against the volume factor of the corresponding invariant sublattice , which is @xmath317 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath4 outer - automorphism twist contributes only one fixed point .",
    "this follows from the form of the invariant sublattice .",
    "the only non - trivial contribution to the number of fixed points in the twisted sectors comes from the symmetric @xmath4 twist in @xmath298 .",
    "this twist contributes @xmath318 fixed points .    to see how level - matching works ,",
    "let us illustrate with the scalar superpartners of these matter fields coming from the @xmath4 twisted sector , namely , the @xmath319 sector .",
    "the right - moving ground state energy of this sector is given by @xmath320 where the first term gives the conformal dimension of the @xmath4 fixed points , and the second term gives the conformal dimension of the corresponding world - sheet fermions , whose spin - structures are dictated by world - sheet supersymmetry .",
    "the factor @xmath0 comes from the @xmath0 complex world - sheet bosons and fermions .",
    "the left - moving ground state energy of this sector can be calculated in a number of ways . in the above basis of @xmath310 and @xmath309 , @xmath302 ,",
    "the @xmath4 outer - automorphism twist @xmath168 can be written as @xmath321 that is , @xmath168 is equivalent to a @xmath4 twist on the @xmath10 complex world - sheet bosons @xmath310 , while leaving the @xmath309 untouched .",
    "so the left - moving ground state energy is given by @xmath322 to identify the @xmath34 chiral families , we are interested in finding the momenta @xmath323 inside the dual of the @xmath4-invariant sublattice @xmath324 made of @xmath309 and @xmath124 , @xmath65 , @xmath325 .",
    "that is , we want to find @xmath323 such that @xmath326 this is satisfied for @xmath327 = @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 , since the conformal dimension of @xmath118 is @xmath331 and that of @xmath120 is @xmath332 .",
    "we see that level - matching requires the @xmath314 shift in the @xmath124 lattice .",
    "recall that there are @xmath333 fixed points in this @xmath4 twisted sector .",
    "the left - moving fixed points fall under irreps of the @xmath334 ; so we have three copies ( due to the three right - moving fixed points ) of massless states in the @xmath335 irreps @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 ( here we give the @xmath43 charge in parentheses , and its normalization is @xmath339 ) .",
    "note that the @xmath334 anomaly coming from these states is precisely cancelled by the @xmath0 copies of @xmath340 coming from the untwisted sector .    to cut the number of families to @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath179 twist is introduced .",
    "the @xmath166 in the @xmath179 twist is a @xmath167 rotation of the corresponding two chiral world - sheet bosons .",
    "thus , @xmath166 is a @xmath28 twist .",
    "the left - moving momenta of @xmath297 are shifted by @xmath341 ( @xmath65 , half a root vector ) , while the @xmath70 is left untouched .",
    "so this model has @xmath204 gauge symmetry .",
    "of the @xmath333 fixed points in the @xmath4 twisted sector , the one at the origin is invariant under this @xmath28 twist .",
    "the remaining @xmath342 fixed points form @xmath6 pairs , and the @xmath28 twist permutes the @xmath11 fixed points in each pair . forming @xmath6 symmetric and @xmath6 antisymmetric combinations , we have @xmath343 ( where the @xmath28 phases are given in parentheses ) ; that is , @xmath10 of the original @xmath333 are invariant under the @xmath28 twist . since there is no relative phase between the @xmath344 and @xmath319 sectors ,",
    "these @xmath10 copies of the @xmath34 chiral matter fields survive , while the other @xmath6 are projected out .",
    "the @xmath24 quantum numbers of these @xmath10 left - handed families can be easily worked out .",
    "they , and the remaining massless spectrum of the resulting orbifold , the @xmath203 model , is given in table vi .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss models that are not chiral . in particular , we explain why it is not possible to start from an @xmath14 non - chiral model which is obtained with a single @xmath4 twist , and introduce chiral fermions by @xmath28 orbifolding it .",
    "first , consider the following example .",
    "start from the @xmath140 model and perform the following @xmath4 twist : @xmath345 this model has @xmath14 space - time supersymmetry and @xmath346 gauge symmetry .",
    "note that in the above twist we have not shifted the @xmath124 lattice .",
    "this shift was the source of chirality of fermions coming from the twisted sectors of all the models considered in the main text , _",
    "i.e. _ , it correlates the space - time helicity of a state in the twisted sector with the gauge quantum numbers .",
    "thus , in the above model , the fermions from the twisted sectors are not chiral .",
    "in particular , the @xmath175 sector gives rise to @xmath0 left - handed families of fermions in @xmath8 of @xmath34 , and also @xmath0 right - handed families of fermions in @xmath8 of @xmath34 .",
    "these combine into @xmath0 non - chiral families of fermions transforming in the spinor representation of @xmath34 .",
    "suppose now we would like to project the right - handed fermions out by adding a @xmath28 twits . to do this",
    ", we will have to correlate the @xmath347 quantum numbers with the right - moving word - sheet fermion quantum numbers in this @xmath28 twist .",
    "this , however , as we already explained in the beginning of section iv , would destroy the @xmath4 symmetry of the lattice , so that the resulting model would not be a consistent orbifold model .",
    "note that our choice of @xmath4 twists in the main text was dictated by the requirements of @xmath14 space - time supersymmetry , presence of chiral fermions , and the level - matching requirement .",
    "these twists then fix the form of the additional @xmath28 twists that must be added to obtain models with three families . here",
    "we note that no other order twists ( say , @xmath29 ) would be compatible with the @xmath4 twists .    finally , we point out one interesting feature of the non - chiral model given in this appendix .",
    "this model has three families of adjoints of @xmath34 coming from the untwisted sector .",
    "these are neutral under all the other gauge groups .",
    "there are , however , three additional adjoints coming from the twisted sector .",
    "these are charged under the @xmath348 ( but they are neutral under @xmath349 ) .",
    "this is an example of a model , although this is only a toy model , where higher dimensional higgs fields can carry additional gauge quantum numbers .",
    "such fields can only come from the twisted sector , whereas , say , adjoints that come from the untwisted sector are always neutral under all the other gauge groups @xcite .",
    ".the massless spectra of the two @xmath2 models @xmath173 and @xmath180 both with gauge symmetry @xmath350 .",
    "the @xmath43 normalization radii are given at the bottom of the table .",
