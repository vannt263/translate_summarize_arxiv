    "correlations in momentum space between hadrons produced in high energy interactions have been extensively studied over many decades in different contexts  @xcite .",

    "the suggestion in  @xcite that multiparticle dynamics might possess ( multi-)fractal properties or be `` intermittent '' , emphasized the importance of studying correlations as a function of the size of domains in momentum space .",

    "phase space cells , they rapidly increase as the cell - size , @xmath58 , becomes smaller .",
    "further studies of the dependence on particle charge confirm that , as conjectured in  @xcite , correlations between hadrons with the same charge play an increasingly important role as @xmath58 decreases , thus pointing to the influence of bose - einstein ( be ) interference effects  @xcite ; for a recent review see  @xcite . in contrast , correlations in multiplets composed of particles with different charges , which are more sensitive to multiparticle resonance decays than like - sign ones , tend to saturate in small phase space domains  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] it is seen that , even in 1d , positive genuine correlations among groups of two , three and four particles are present : @xmath134 .",
    "they are substantially stronger in rapidity than in azimuthal angle .",
    "the cumulants increase rapidly with increasing @xmath125 , the inverse of the bin size , for relatively large domains but saturate rather quickly . for @xmath135",
    "this behaviour follows from the shape of the second - order correlation function which is known to be approximately gaussian  @xcite in the two - particle rapidity difference @xmath136 .",
    "the rapid rise and subsequent saturation can be understood from hard gluon jet emission . for small @xmath125 ,",
    "the cumulants are sensitive to the large - scale structure of the event , where any jet non - collinear with the event axis produces a strong fluctuation in the particle density . with @xmath125 increasing ,",
    "the structure inside a single jet is progressively probed .",
    "in contrast to 1d cumulants , those in 2d and 3d ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) continue to increase towards small phase space cells . moreover , the 2d and 3d cumulants are of similar magnitude at fixed @xmath125 , indicating that the contribution from correlations in transverse momentum is small .",
    "this can be understood from the importance of multi - jet production in @xmath62 annihilation , which is most prominently observed in @xmath137 space  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the 1d cumulants in @xmath121 are found to be close to zero and therefore not shown .",
    "it is to be noted that oscillations of the cumulants , clearly seen in the data as well as in the monte carlo predictions ( see   @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) are not due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "they arise from the jet structure of the events in rapidity - azimuthal angle subspace , and from the phase space partitioning technique used to calculate the cumulants as a function of @xmath125 .",
    "the 1d cumulants of all - charge and of like - sign multiplets ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) show a similar dependence on @xmath125 .",
    "the latter , however , are significantly smaller , implying that , for all @xmath125 , correlations among particles of opposite charge are important in one - dimensional phase space projections . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : plusminus ] ) , it is found that the one - dimensional cumulants for unlike - charge pairs are larger by a factor of @xmath139 than those of like - sign pairs for @xmath140 .",
    "this can be expected in general from local charge conservation and in particular from resonance decays .    in 2d and 3d ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) , like - sign cumulants increase faster and approach the all - charge ones at large @xmath125 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : plusminus ] ) , it can be inferred that @xmath135 for unlike - charge pairs remains essentially constant for @xmath125 larger than about 6 . consequently ,",
    "as the cell - size becomes smaller , the rise of all - charge correlations is increasingly driven by that of like - sign multiplets .",
    "similar features , but based on measurements of _ factorial moments _ , were observed in other experiments  @xcite and , mainly on qualitative grounds , taken as evidence for the large influence of the bose - einstein effect on all - charge correlations in small phase space domains . in the next section , we add quantitative support to those earlier observations , showing that algorithms which simulate bec indeed allow a quite successful description of the measurements .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the cumulant data with predictions of the   monte carlo event generator ( version 6.158 ) without and with bose - einstein effects .",
    "samples of about @xmath88 multihadronic events were generated at the energy .",

    "additional studies have revealed some sensitivity of single - particle spectra and event shapes to the inclusion of bec in . nevertheless , it was found that minor variations of the qcd and fragmentation parameters are sufficient to restore agreement with these data , while the changes in the predicted cumulants remain well within the systematic uncertainties of the measurement .",

    "to assess the sensitivity of the cumulants to variations in the bec algorithms available in , we have further considered the algorithms be@xmath159 and be@xmath160 ( see appendix ) . using the same parameter values as for be@xmath105 , we observe that be@xmath159 slightly underestimates @xmath161 and overestimates @xmath158 for like - sign pairs ( fig .",

    "the mass - shift occurs since the be - induced momentum changes increase the likelihood that soft particles in an event are assigned to the wrong jet .",
    "this , in turn , depends on the strength of the particle correlations in 3d momentum space . since be@xmath105 and be@xmath164 provide a reasonable description of the domain - size dependence of all - charge cumulants in 3d , both algorithms should be considered in @xmath165 studies .    finally , we consider the model predictions based on the algorithm be@xmath160 ( dash - dotted curves in the figures ) for the same parameter values as quoted above . for like - sign pairs ( fig .",

    "it is , for that reason , disfavoured by the authors of  @xcite .",
    "traditional studies of the bose - einstein effect most often consider only the second - order correlation function for like - sign particle pairs , which is measured as a function of @xmath167 , the square of the difference in four - momenta @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) of particles in the pair . the variable @xmath170 is related to the 3d cell - size used in this paper , via the approximate relation  @xcite : @xmath171 , \\label{eq : cellsize}\\ ] ] valid for small domains in @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "we have compared predictions for the inclusive two - particle @xmath174-distribution of like - sign pairs ( single - particle rapidity restricted to the interval @xmath175 ) from the be@xmath105 model to that extracted from the data and fully corrected for detector effects . for the values of the bec parameters @xmath103 and @xmath102 quoted above ,",
    "satisfactory agreement is obtained ( not shown ) .    in recent work ,",
    "several lep experiments have analyzed the second - order like - sign correlation function in terms of individual components of the four - vector @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as a measurement of the space - time extent of the particle emitting source , such results show that the emission volume has an elongated shape with respect to the event axis .",
    "the be algorithms discussed here , which treat all components of @xmath174 symmetrically , are unable to reproduce these measurements  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible , although to be verified , that the measured anisotropy of the two - particle correlation function may be responsible for some of the  model discrepancies , for 1d cumulants in @xmath115 domains , observed in the present analysis .    in summary",
    ", a comparison with  predictions shows that short - range correlations of the be - type are needed , at least in this model , to reproduce the magnitude and the @xmath58-dependence of the cumulants for like - sign multiplets .",
    "this further leads to a much improved description of not only two - particle but also of higher - order correlations in all - charge multiplets .",
    "since bose - einstein correlations are a well - established phenomenon in multiparticle production , it is likely that the above conclusion has wider validity than the model from which it was derived .",
    "the success of the   model with bec in predicting both the magnitude and domain - size dependence of cumulants , has led us to consider the inter - dependence of these quantities in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we plot @xmath153 and @xmath154 in 2d and 3d , for each value of @xmath125 as a function of @xmath135 .",
    "we observe that the 2d and 3d data for all - charge , as well as for like - sign multiplets follow approximately , within errors , the same functional dependence .",
    "the solid lines is a simple fit to the function @xmath176 the fitted slope values are @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "this is evidence that the slope @xmath179 increases with the order of the cumulant .",
    "the @xmath59-dependence of the slopes is of particular interest in multiplicative cascade models of hadronisation , and indicative of the mechanism causing scale - invariant fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] suggests that the _ cumulants _ of different orders obey simple so - called `` hierarchical '' relations , analogous to the ochs - wosiek relation , first established for _ factorial moments _  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all - charge as well as like - sign multiplets are seen to follow , within errors , the same functional dependence .",
    "hierarchical relations of similar type are commonly encountered , or conjectured , in various branches of many - body physics ( see  @xcite ) , but a satisfactory explanation within particle production phenomenology or qcd remains to be found .",
    "simple relations among the cumulants of different orders exist for certain probability distributions , such as the negative binomial distribution , which often parameterizes successfully the multiplicity distribution of hadrons in restricted phase space regions  @xcite . for this distribution",
    ", one has @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) , showing that the cumulants are here solely determined by @xmath135 .",
    "this relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ( dashed line ) . comparing to the data",
    ", we conclude that the multiplicity distribution of all charged particles , as well as that of like - sign particles , deviates strongly from a negative binomial in small phase space domains . for further discussion , in the present context , of this and other much studied multiplicity distributions",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the ochs - wosiek type of relation exhibited by the data in fig .  [ fig:5 ] may explain why the be algorithms in   generate higher - order correlations of ( approximately ) the correct magnitude .",
    "assuming that the hadronization dynamics is such that higher - order correlation functions can be constructed from second - order correlations only , methods that are designed to ensure agreement with the two - particle correlation function , could then automatically generate higher - order ones of the correct magnitude .",
    "in this paper we have presented a comparative study of like - sign and all - charge genuine correlations between two and more hadrons produced in @xmath62 annihilation at the @xmath182 energy .",
    "the high - statistics data on hadronic @xmath183 decays recorded with the opal detector from 1991 through 1995 were used to measure normalized factorial cumulants as a function of the domain size , @xmath58 , in @xmath64-dimensional domains ( @xmath184 ) in rapidity , azimuthal angle and ( the logarithm of ) transverse momentum , defined in the event sphericity frame .    both all - charge and like - sign multiplets show strong positive genuine correlations up to fourth order .",
    "they are stronger in rapidity than in azimuthal angle .",
    "one - dimensional cumulants initially increase rapidly with decreasing size of the phase space cells but saturate rather quickly .",
    "in contrast , 2d and especially 3d cumulants continue to increase and exhibit intermittency - like behaviour .    comparing all - charge and like - sign multiplets in 2d and 3d phase space cells , we observe that the rise of the cumulants for all - charge multiplets is increasingly driven by that of like - sign multiplets as @xmath58 becomes smaller .",
    "this points to the likely influence of bose - einstein correlations .",
    "the 2d and 3d cumulants @xmath153 and @xmath154 , considered as a function of @xmath135 , follow approximately a linear relation of the ochs - wosiek type : @xmath185 , independent of @xmath64 and the same for all - charge and for like - sign particle groups .",
    "this suggests that , for a given domain @xmath58 , correlation functions of different orders are not independent but determined , to a large extent , by two - particle correlations .",
    "the data have been compared with predictions from the monte carlo event generator , previously tuned to single - particle and event - shape opal data .",
    "the model describes well dynamical fluctuations in large phase space domains , caused by jet production , and shorter - range correlations attributable to resonance decays .",
    "however , the results of this paper , together with earlier less precise data , show that these ingredients alone are insufficient to explain the magnitude and domain - size dependence of the factorial cumulants . to achieve a more satisfactory data description ,",
    "short - range correlations of the bose - einstein type between identical particles need to be included .",
    "the importance of be - type effects has been studied using algorithms implemented in .",
    "we find that the model be@xmath105 is able to simultaneously account for the magnitude and @xmath58-dependence of like - sign as well as of all - charge cumulants .",
    "other models , be@xmath160 and be@xmath159 , when using the same parameters as for be@xmath105 , provide also a reasonable description of the data .",
    "although the algorithms implement pair - wise bec only , surprisingly good agreement with the measured third- and fourth - order cumulants is observed .",
    "this could be a consequence of the ochs - wosiek type of inter - relationship between cumulants of different orders , exhibited by the data .",
