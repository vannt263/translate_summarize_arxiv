    "in recent years , as observational data concerning on cosmology are rapidly accurate , the theoretical understanding of our universe has been greatly profounded ever before .",

    "both issues are closely related to the cosmological term in einstein equation . the observational value of the cosmological constant @xmath0 where the newton constant @xmath1 , the planck mass @xmath2gev and a related characteristic energy - density @xmath3 this energy - density is of @xmath4 order smaller than the planck energy - density , @xmath5 .",
    "much effort in understanding these issues has been made for many decades and there are many interesting ideas and innovative theoretical developments based on either simple models @xcite or complex theories @xcite . in these approaches , a scalar field slowly - rolling downwards an effective potential , which mimics a possible vacuum - energy variation , plays a crucial rle in driving inflation ; whereas this scalar field with a mass of order the current hubble scale , can possibly account for acceleration .    in this article",
    ", we attempt to study these two issues within a framework based on the instability of flat space at finite temperature , due to an unstable quantum fluctuation about gravitational instantons .",
    "we shall use the signature @xmath6 .",
    "the gravitational field interacts only with the total energy - momentum @xmath7 that is attributed to both fundamental particles and vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 appears as source of the gravitational field .",
    "the gravitational field equation should therefore be of form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the newton constant . in the left - handed side of the field equation",
    ", @xmath10 is some expression involving the metric @xmath11 and its derivatives .",
    "the field equation ( [ geq0 ] ) is invariant under general coordinate transformations , therefore @xmath10 must be a tensor .",
    "it is further assumed that the field equation ( [ geq0 ] ) is of second differential order , and is linear in the second derivatives .",
    "we know that the only tensor that contains the second derivative linearly is @xmath12 .",
    "hence the only tensors available for the construction of @xmath10 are @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the most general second - rank tensor that can be built out of these , with @xmath12 entering linearly , is @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the ricci tensor ( scalar ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "the conservation law for the energy - momentum tensor of matter fields @xmath18 requires the object @xmath10 must satisfy the identity @xmath19 in view of @xmath20 and the bianchi identity @xmath21 the identity ( [ geqi0 ] ) is fulfilled if @xmath22 . the @xmath17 remains as an arbitrary constant .",
    "thus , gravitational field equation becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cosmological term ( @xmath17-term ) and @xmath17 is the so - called cosmological constant .",
    "the @xmath17-term clearly has its gravitational origin ( or geometric origin ) , rather than material origin . in newtonian gravitating systems , the cosmological constant @xmath25 consistently with observations and experiments .      in the context of local quantum field theories ,",

    "it corresponds the classical energy - momentum , entering the right - handed side of the field equation ( [ e1],[gt ] ) as the source for gravitational field .    however , we expect to have some problems in such a scenario : ( i ) the ground state ( vacuum ) of quantum gravity at the planck scale is still an open question ; ( ii ) the energy - momentum difference ( [ cgt ] ) between fundamental particles states and vacuum state must be altered by the back reaction of fundamental particles ( including gravitational field ) on the vacuum state ; ( iii ) at very high temperature @xmath35 , thermal fluctuations are much more important than quantum - field fluctuations , and the vacuum is not stable .      the second part @xmath36 in the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath7 ( [ gt ] ) is the variation of the vacuum energy - momentum , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the modified energy - momentum tensor caused by back reactions of external sources : ( i ) boundary conditions ; ( ii ) classical fields ; and ( iii ) fundamental particles on the vacuum .",
    "the vacuum energy - momentum is altered , due to external sources back interacting with vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations , whose wavelengths are the order of the characteristic length scale of external sources , are most strongly affected . as a result , the variation of vacuum energy - momentum @xmath39 is determined by the characteristic scales of external sources . in the case of external source",
    "being boundary condition , for example the casimir effect @xcite , the variation of vacuum energy - density is @xmath40 where the characteristic scale is @xmath41 is the separation between two conducting plates . in the case of external source being classical gravitational field , for example the hawking effect @xcite for an astrophysical black hole , the variation of vacuum energy - density is ( a scalar field with two polarizations ) @xmath42 where the hawking temperature @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the black hole mass and the characteristic scale is the black hole size @xmath45 . with macroscopic lengths",
    "@xmath46 cm and astrophysical black hole sizes @xmath47 cm , one finds that the variations of vacuum energy - density are very much smaller than the energy - density @xmath48 of an electron at rest , where @xmath49 is the electron mass .",
    "the variation of the vacuum energy - momentum @xmath36 due to back reactions has very small gravitating effect and is negligible in the right - handed side of gravitational field equation ( [ e1 ] ) .    in the assumption that vacuum fluctuations are homogeneously distributed in whole universe ,",

    "it can be conceptually misleading , if one simply moves the @xmath17-term from the left - handed side to the right - handed side of the einstein equation ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "one is certainly allowed to optionally adopt a non - vanishing vacuum energy - momentum tensor @xmath59 , and model the vacuum of quantum field theories as a perfect fluid with energy - density @xmath60 , pressure @xmath61 and the equation of state @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the four velocity of fluid elements . however , in this framework , the energy - momentum tensor @xmath65 in eq .",
