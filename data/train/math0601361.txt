    "the _ distinguishing number _ of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath1 , is the smallest number of colors @xmath13 such that there exists a distinguishing @xmath13-coloring of @xmath0 .",

    "cowen computed @xmath25 and @xmath26 for each @xmath4 , where @xmath27 denotes the @xmath4-dimensional hypercube and @xmath2 denotes its @xmath3 graph power .",
    "they also noted that @xmath28 is easily computable when @xmath29 .",
    "they left @xmath28 for @xmath5 as an open question , conjecturing that @xmath30 for fixed @xmath31 and sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "additionally , they offered the weaker conjecture that there exists a constant @xmath16 such that @xmath32 for fixed @xmath31 and sufficiently large @xmath4 .    in this paper , we show that @xmath30 for each @xmath31 and @xmath4 satisfying @xmath5 .",
    "the proof relies on a surprising theorem in @xcite on the automorphism group of hypercube powers .",
    "this result completes the determination of the distinguishing number of all hypercube powers of all dimensions .",
    "we then move on to consider the distinguishing number of the augmented cube , introduced by choudum and sunitha in @xcite as a variation on the hypercube possessing several favorable network properties .",
    "we compute the distinguishing number of the augmented cube of each dimension .",
    "finally , we answer an open question posed by albertson and collins in @xcite on the existence of a class of graphs @xmath33 whose sequence of distinguishing numbers increases to some @xmath34 and then decreases to 2 . we show that the augmented cubes have precisely this property .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional hypercube , denoted @xmath27 , is the graph on @xmath35 vertices labeled by length-@xmath4 binary strings @xmath36 and where two vertices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are joined by an edge if and only if @xmath39 . the @xmath40 power of a graph @xmath0 , denoted @xmath41 , is defined to be a new graph with the same vertex set as @xmath0 and in which two distinct vertices in @xmath41 are connected by an edge if the corresponding vertices in @xmath0 are at distance at most @xmath31 .",

    "they note further that the graph @xmath54 consists of the complement of a perfect matching on @xmath35 vertices , and both graphs have distinguishing number @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we have already seen that for @xmath56 , the graph @xmath2 is isomorphic to the complete graph @xmath57 and so has distinguishing number @xmath35 .",
    "the authors leave @xmath28 for @xmath5 as an open question . at this point",
    ", we wish to draw the reader s attention to the following very surprising theorem proved in @xcite .",
    "* section 1 ) [ t : m_p ] for @xmath5 , @xmath58    for clarity s sake , we note the following subtlety .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that two graphs with automorphism groups that are isomorphic may still have different distinguishing numbers .",
    "however , theorem [ t : m_p ] gives more than just isomorphisms between the groups under consideration .",
    "for note that an automorphism of @xmath27 preserves all distances in @xmath27 and is therefore an automorphism of @xmath2 for any power @xmath31 .",
    "so @xmath59 is realized as a subgroup of @xmath60 .",
    "theorem [ t : m_p ] tells us that for any odd @xmath31 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are in fact precisely the same subgroup of the permutation group of their vertices , and so they act with equal distinguishing number .",

    "a similar argument shows that @xmath62 .",
    "we summarize as follows :    @xmath30 for @xmath5 .",
    "this gives a complete answer to the question posed in @xcite .    before concluding our discussion of hypercube powers , we state a simple but useful lemma .    [ l : subgroup_graph ] suppose @xmath63 and @xmath64 are graphs on the same vertex set , and @xmath65 is a subgroup of @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath67 .    by definition",
    ", there exists a @xmath68-coloring of the vertices of @xmath64 such that no nonidentity automorphism of @xmath64 preserves it .",
    "in particular , since @xmath69 , no nonidentity automorphism of @xmath63 preserves this coloring . so @xmath68 colors suffice to produce a distinguishing coloring of @xmath63 .",

    "indeed , it is shown that @xmath70 for @xmath11 .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath59 is a subgroup of @xmath71 , so @xmath72 . since @xmath59 is nontrivial , @xmath73 , so @xmath74 for @xmath11 .",

    "the edges of the augmented @xmath4-cube , however , are a superset of the edges of the @xmath4-cube .",
