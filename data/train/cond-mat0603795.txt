    "the characteristic energy oscillations are evident in both geometries . the structure of the oscillations , however , shows interesting differences . in the circular case",
    "there are three easily distinguished phases : ( i ) strong oscillations at low @xmath38 that mostly correspond to spin changes @xmath58 following hund s rule ; ( ii ) spin flip region at intermediate @xmath38 that becomes broader as @xmath2 increases ; and ( iii ) a polarized regime in high magnetic fields on the right side of the dashed line(s ) , characterized by large - width oscillations of a period @xmath59 ( the flux @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the estimated ring area ) .",
    "a similar division can be found in the addition energies of a square ring [ fig .",

    "this result agrees qualitatively with the experimental observation of fuhrer and co - workers .",
    "@xcite it can be explained by the fact that the magnetic confinement has a parabolic shape .",

    "after that the oscillations become regular such that each step corresponds to an increase of 24 in the total angular momentum @xmath76 , as the electrons jump from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , the hole in the electron density at the center of the ring increases , and there are no signs of edge reconstruction , which confirms the result of emperador and co - workers .",
    "@xcite    the behavior in the electron occupations and magnetization as a function of @xmath38 is similar to that of a quantum - dot system .",

    "we find that the distribution for @xmath34 shows a clear two - peak structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this case the rings can be roughly divided into relatively disordered and clean ones depending on the actual location of the impurities .",
    "these two types of rings have then different radii on the average , which eventually leads to a phase shift in the ab oscillations as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "as the number of impurities is increased , the two peaks gradually merge and finally at @xmath82 , corresponding to an impurity density of @xmath83 , we find a gaussian - like symmetric distribution shown in fig .",

    "@xcite in addition , modifications to the random matrix theory that take the interactions into account have led to a good agreement between the experiments and the theory ,  @xcite whereas the bare random matrix theory yields the wigner - dyson distribution .",
    "hence , we expect that the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ distr](d ) for quantum rings corresponds to the limit of disorder which ultimately indicates the disappearance of the ab oscillations .",

    "the addition - energy statistics would be determined as a function of @xmath2 .",

    "increasing magnetic field evens out the variations between the energetics of quantum rings of different geometries .",
    "the measurable quantities in both systems can be characterized by quasiperiodic oscillations , of which we have been able to identify the quantum - ring counterparts of the integer quantum - hall states . however , the aharonov - bohm oscillations at high fields are very sensitive to the presence of external impurities which may produce a systematic phase shift . in the high - impurity ( disorder )",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of impurities and changing ring geometry on the energetics of quantum rings under different magnetic field strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as the magnetic field and/or the electron number are / is increased , both the quasiperiodic aharonov - bohm oscillations and various magnetic phases become insensitive to whether the ring is circular or square in shape . </S>",
    "<S> this is in qualitative agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also find that the aharonov - bohm oscillation can be greatly phase - shifted by only a few impurities and can be completely obliterated by a high level of impurity density . in the many - electron calculations we use a recently developed fourth - order imaginary time projection algorithm that can exactly compute the density matrix of a free - electron in a uniform magnetic field . </S>"
