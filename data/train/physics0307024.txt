    "is lost and a rather high threshold power is needed to initiate the lasing effect .",
    "in contrast , spherical and disk cavities can be used to support highly efficient low - threshold lasing operation . the high efficiency of such devices is related to the existence the natural cavity resonances .",
    "these resonances are known as morphology - dependent resonances or whispering gallery modes @xcite .",
    "the nature of these resonances can be envisioned in a ray optic picture , when light is trapped inside the cavity through the total internal reflection on the cavity - air boundary .    in dielectric cavities",
    "optically pumped quantum wells , wires or dots provide an active medium sustaining the lasing operation @xcite .",
    "polymeric microcavity lasers are made with an active medium including host and guest molecules @xcite .",
    "the absorbed light is transferred from the photoexcited host molecules in the non - radiative way by means of resonant energy transfer to the guest molecules .",
    "a stimulated emission from the active medium of dielectric and polymeric cavities is trapped in high-@xmath0 modes for a very long time .",
    "this leads to a significant increase of intensity of radiation inside the cavity and hence to low - threshold laser operation .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of cavity resonances is their quality factor ( @xmath0-factor ) defined as @xmath2(stored energy)/(energy lost per cycle ) . the high value of the @xmath3factor results from very low radiative losses that are mainly caused by radiation leakage due to diffraction on the curved interface .",
    "an estimation of the @xmath0-factor in an ideal circular disk cavity of a typical diameter @xmath4 m for a typical wg resonance gives @xmath5 ( see below , eq .",
    "( [ eq_t ] ) ) . at the same time , experimental measured values reported so far are typically in the range of @xmath6 or lower @xcite .",
    "a reduction of a @xmath0-factor may be attributed to a variety of reasons including side wall geometrical imperfections , inhomogeneity of the diffraction index of the disk , effects of coupling to the substrate or pedestal and others .",
    "a detailed study of the effects of the above factors on the characteristics and performance of the microcavity lasers appears to be of crucial importance for the design , tailoring and optimization of @xmath0-values of lasing microdisk cavities .",
    "such the studies would require an effective computational method that can deal with both complex geometry and variable refraction index in the cavity .",
    "one of the most powerful and versatile numerical techniques often used in photonic simulation is the finite difference time domain method ( fdtd ) @xcite .",
    "a severe disadvantage of this technique in application to the cavities with small surface imperfections is that the smooth geometry of the cavity has to be mapped into a discrete grid with very small lattice constant .",
    "this makes the application of this method to the problem at hand rather impractical in terms of both computational power and memory .",
    "another class of computational methods reduces the helmholtz equation in the infinite two - dimensional space into contour integral equations defined at the cavity boundaries .",
    "these methods include the @xmath7-matrix technique @xcite , the boundary integral methods @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "these methods are computationally effective and capable to deal with the cavities of arbitrary geometry .",
    "however , the above methods require the refraction index be constant inside the cavity boundary .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a new , computationally effective , and numerically stable approach based on the scattering matrix technique that is capable to deal with _ both _ arbitrary complex geometry and inhomogeneous refraction index inside the cavity .",
    "note that the scattering matrix technique is widely used in analysis of waveguides@xcite as well as in quantum mechanical simulations@xcite .",
    "this technique was also used for the analysis of resonant cavities for geometries when the analytical solution was available@xcite .",
    "the main idea of the method consists of dividing the cavity region into @xmath8 narrow concentric rings . at each @xmath9-th boundary between the neighboring rings we calculate the scattering matrix @xmath10 that relates the states propagating ( or decaying ) towards the boundary , with those propagating ( or decaying ) away of the boundary . successively combining the scattering matrixes for all the boundaries@xcite , @xmath11",
    ", we eventually relate the combined matrix to the total scattering matrix of the cavity @xmath12 . in order to calculate the lifetime of the cavity modes ( and , therefore their @xmath0-factor )",
    "we compute the wigner - smith lifetime matrix@xcite which , in turn , is expressed in terms of the total scattering matrix @xmath12 @xcite .    because at each step we combine only two scattering matrixes , it is not required to keep track of the solution in the whole space .",
    "this obviously eliminates the need for storing large matrices and facilitates the computational speed .",
    "it is also well known that the scattering matrix technique ( in contrast , for example , to the transfer matrix technique ) is not plagued by numerical instability , because exponentially growing and decaying evanescent waves are separated in course of the computation .",
    "note that the present technique of combining @xmath13-matrixes is conceptually similar to the recurrence algorithm for calculating electromagnetic scattering from a multilayered sphere @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to these works , the scattering matrix technique presented here can be applied to the systems where the refraction index varies as a function of both radial and angular coordinates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basics ]",
    "we develop the scattering matrix technique for disk - shaped cavities .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of resonant states and @xmath0-values of nonideal cavities on the basis of the developed technique are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we consider and compare two cases , a disk cavity of a constant refraction index @xmath14 with side wall imperfection ( surface roughness ) , and , a disk cavity of an ideal circular shape but with inhomogeneous refraction index @xmath15 .",

    "we consider a two - dimensional cavity with the refraction index @xmath14 surrounded by air .",
    "because the majority of experiments are performed only with the lowest transverse mode occupied , we neglect the transverse ( @xmath16- ) dependence of the field and thus limit ourself to the two - dimensional helmholtz equation . the two - dimensional helmholtz equation for @xmath16-components of electromagnetic field",

    "[ spectra ] ) .    to explain the rapid degradation of high-@xmath0 resonances , we concentrate on another aspect of the wave dynamics .",
    "namely , the imperfections at the surface boundary effectively introduce a local radius of a surface curvature @xmath138 that is distinct from the disk radius @xmath27 ( see illustration in fig .",
    "[ examples ] ) .",
    "one may thus expect that with the presence of the local surface curvature , the total transmission coefficient will be determined by the averaged value of @xmath138 rather than by the disk radius @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath138 on surface roughness @xmath145 for the present model of surface imperfections is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "figure [ t ] demonstrates that the reduction of the local radius of curvature from @xmath206 m ( ideal disk ) to @xmath207 m ( @xmath208 nm ) causes an increase of the transmission coefficient by @xmath209 .",
    "this estimate , combined with the estimate based on the change of @xmath200 is fully consistent with the actual computed decrease of the @xmath0-factor shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the main mechanism responsible for the rapid degradation of high-@xmath0 resonances in non - ideal cavities is the enhanced radiative decay through the curved surface because the effective local radius ( given by the surface roughness ) is smaller that the disk radius @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , the degradation of low-@xmath0 resonances ( as well as high-@xmath0 resonances in the case of inhomogeneous refraction index only ) , is mostly related to the broadening of the phase space caused by the transition to the chaotic dynamics .",
    "it should be noted however that both factors ( broadening of the phase space and the enhancement of the transmission due to decrease of the effective radius of curvature ) may play a comparable role in degradation of the low-@xmath0 whispering - gallery resonances in the presence of surface roughness .",
    "it is interesting to note that an analogues degradation of high-@xmath0 modes was recently found in hexagonal - shaped microcavities , where the modes were strongly influenced by roundings of the corners even when the characteristic length scale ( the local radius of curvature ) was one order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that one often assumes that long - lived high-@xmath0 resonances in idealized cavities ( e.g. in ideal disks , hexagons , etc . )",
    "are not important for potential application in optical communication or laser devices@xcite because of their extremely narrow width .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that it is not the case , because in real structures the @xmath0-values of these resonances becomes comparable to those of intermediate-@xmath0 resonances already for small or moderate surface roughness of @xmath210 nm .",
    "in the present paper we develop a new , computationally effective , and numerically stable approach based on the scattering matrix ( @xmath13-matrix ) technique that is capable to deal with _ both _ arbitrary complex geometry and inhomogeneous refraction index inside the two - dimensional cavity .",
    "the derivation is based on the separation of the cavity region into @xmath8 narrow concentric rings and calculation of the @xmath13-matrix at every boundary between the rings .",
    "the total @xmath13-matrix is obtained in a recursive way by successive combination of the scattering matrixes for all the boundaries . in order to calculate the lifetime of the cavity modes ( and , therefore their @xmath0-factors )",
    "we compute the wigner - smith time delay - matrix which , in turn , is expressed in terms of the total scattering matrix .",
    "we apply the developed algorithm to the calculation of resonant states and @xmath0-values of nonideal microdisk cavities with ( a ) side wall imperfections and ( b ) circular cavities with inhomogeneous refraction index @xmath15 .",
    "we find that the surface roughness @xmath145 and refraction index inhomogeneity @xmath151 that produce similar degradation of low-@xmath0 states , cause strikingly different effect on high-@xmath0 resonances . in particularly , in the case of inhomogeneous refraction index the increase of @xmath151",
    "causes rather graduate decrease of the @xmath0-value of high-@xmath0 resonances .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of surface roughness even small imperfections ( @xmath211 ) can lead to a drastic degradation of high-@xmath0 cavity modes by many orders of magnitude .    in order to understand these features",
