    "high energy neutrino telescopes are multi - purpose instruments ; their science mission covers particle physics , astronomy and astrophysics , cosmology and cosmic ray physics .",
    "their deployment creates new opportunities for glaciology and oceanography , possibly geology of the earth s core@xcite .",
    "astronomy with neutrinos does have definite advantages .",
    "they can reach us , essentially without attenuation in flux , from the largest red - shifts .",
    "the sky is , in contrast , partially opaque to high energy photons and protons because of energy - loss suffered in interactions with infrared light , cmbr photons and radio waves@xcite .",
    "they do not reach us from distances much larger than tens of megaparsecs once their energy exceeds thresholds of 10  tev for photons and @xmath3  tev for protons .",
    "( below this energy charged protons do not point back to their sources . )",
    "the drawback is that neutrinos are difficult to detect : the small interaction cross sections that enable them to travel without attenuation over a hubble radius , are also the reason why kilometer - scale detectors are required in order to capture them in sufficient numbers to do astronomy@xcite .",
    "some opportunities may , however , be unique .",
    "if , for instance , the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays are beyond @xmath4  mpc , conventional astronomy is unlikely to discover them .    some science missions do not require a detector of kilometer size .",
    "the best opportunities to search for halo dark matter are , in fact , associated with the present instrument which , while smaller in telescope area than the planned extension of amanda to ice3 ( icecube ) , has a lower threshold .    at this meeting , the capability of neutrino telescopes to discover the particles that constitute the dominant , cold component of the dark matter is of special interest . the existence of the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) is inferred from observation of their annihilation products .",
    "cold dark matter particles annihilate into neutrinos ; _ massive _ ones will annihilate into _ high - energy _",
    "neutrinos which can be detected in high - energy neutrino telescopes .",
    "this so - called indirect detection is greatly facilitated by the fact that the earth and the sun represent dense , nearby sources of accumulated cold dark matter particles .",
    "galactic wimps , scattering off nuclei in the sun , lose energy .",
    "they may fall below escape velocity and be gravitationally trapped .",
    "trapped wimps eventually come to equilibrium and accumulate near the center of the sun . while the wimp density builds up , their annihilation rate into lighter particles increases until equilibrium is achieved where the annihilation rate equals half of the capture rate .",
    "the sun has thus become a reservoir of wimps which we expect to annihilate mostly into heavy quarks and , for the heavier wimps , into weak bosons .",
    "the leptonic decays of the heavy quark and weak boson annihilation products turn the sun and earth into nearby sources of high - energy neutrinos with energies in the gev to tev range .",
    "figure  1 displays the neutrino flux from the center of the earth calculated in the context of supersymmetric dark matter theories@xcite .",
    "the direct capture rate of the wimps in germanium detectors is shown for comparison .",
    "contours indicate the parameter space favored by grand unified theories . most of this parameter space can be covered by improving the capabilities of existing detectors by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "existing neutrino detectors have already excluded fluxes of neutrinos from the earth s center of order 1  event per @xmath5 per year .",
    "the best limits have been obtained by the baksan experiment@xcite .",
    "they are already excluding relevant parameter space of supersymmetric models .",
    "we will show that , with data already on tape , the amanda detector will have an unmatched discovery reach for wimp masses in excess of 100  gev .",
    "= 4.5 in    the potential of neutrino telescopes as dark matter detectors has been documented in detail@xcite . with a sensitivity which increases with the wimp mass , they are complementary to direct , cryogenic detectors",
    ". they can detect wimps beyond the kinematic limits of the lhc : about 500  gev for neutralinos .",
    "a striking way to illustrate their potential is to use the possible detection@xcite in the dama nai detector in the gran sasso tunnel as an example .",
    "if their seasonal variation is indeed evidence for wimps , observation of a signal in an exposure of 4500 kgdays requires a wimp - nucleon cross section of @xmath6  cm@xmath1 for a wimp mass of @xmath8  gev .",
    "this information is sufficient to calculate their trapping and annihilation rate in the sun and earth .",
    "both will be a source of , on average , 100 neutrinos per year of wimp origin in the existing amanda detector with an effective area of @xmath0  m@xmath1 .",
    "the exact rate varies with the mass of the wimp .",
    "first generation neutrino detectors , launched by the bold decision of the dumand collaboration over 20 years ago to construct such an instrument , are designed to reach a relatively large telescope area and detection volume for a neutrino threshold of tens of gev , not higher .",
    "this relatively low threshold permits calibration of the novel instrument on the known flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "its architecture is optimized for reconstructing the cherenkov light front radiated by an up - going , neutrino - induced muon .",
    "up - going muons are to be identified in a background of down - going , cosmic ray muons which are more than @xmath9 times more frequent for a depth of 1@xmath22 kilometers .",
    "the method is sketched in fig .  2 .",
    "= 2.75 in    construction of the first - generation amanda detector@xcite was completed in the austral summer 9697 .",
    "it consists of 300 optical modules deployed at a depth of 15002000  m ; see fig .",
    "an optical module ( om ) consists of an 8  inch photomultiplier tube and nothing else .",
    "om s have only failed when the ice refreezes , at a rate of less than 3 percent .",
    "calibration of this detector is in progress , although data has been taken with 80 om s which were deployed one year earlier in order to verify the optical properties of the ice ( amanda-80 ) .    as anticipated from transparency measurements performed with the shallow strings@xcite ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we found that ice is bubble - free at 14001500  meters and below . the performance of the amanda detector is encapsulated in the event shown in fig .  4 . coincident events between amanda-80 and four shallow strings with 80 om",
    "s have been triggered for one year at a rate of 0.1  hz .",
    "every 10 seconds a cosmic ray muon is tracked over 1.2 kilometers .",
    "the contrast in detector response between the strings near 1 and 2  km depths is dramatic : while the cherenkov photons diffuse on remnant bubbles in the shallow ice , a straight track with velocity @xmath10 is registered in the deeper ice .",
    "the optical quality of the deep ice can be assessed by viewing the om signals from a single muon triggering 2 strings separated by 79.5  m ; see fig .",
    "the separation of the photons along the cherenkov cone is well over 100  m , yet , despite some evidence of scattering , the speed - of - light propagation of the track can be readily identified .",
    "= 4.5 in    = 4.5 in    the optical properties of the ice are quantified by studying the propagation in the ice of pulses of laser light of nanosecond duration .",
    "the arrival times of the photons after 20  m and 40  m are shown in fig .  5 for the shallow and deep ice@xcite .",
    "the distributions have been normalized to equal areas ; in reality , the probability that a photon travels 70  m in the deep ice is @xmath11 times larger .",
    "there is no diffusion resulting in loss of information on the geometry of the cherenkov cone in the deep bubble - free ice .",
    "the amanda detector was antecedently proposed on the premise that inferior properties of ice as a particle detector with respect to water could be compensated by additional optical modules .",
    "the technique was supposed to be a factor @xmath12 more cost - effective and , therefore , competitive .",
    "the design was based on then current information@xcite :    * the absorption length at 370  nm , the wavelength where photomultipliers are maximally efficient , had been measured to be 8  m ; * the scattering length was unknown ; * the amanda strategy would have been to use a large number of closely spaced om s to overcome the short absorption length .",
    "muon tracks triggering 6 or more om s are reconstructed with degree accuracy .",
    "taking data with a simple majority trigger of 6 om s or more at 100  hz yields an average effective area of @xmath0  m@xmath1 , somewhat smaller for atmospheric neutrinos and significantly larger for the high energy signals previously discussed .",
    "the reality is that :    * the absorption length is 100  m or more , depending on depth@xcite ; * the scattering length is @xmath13  m ( preliminary , this number represents an average value which may include the combined effects of deep ice and the refrozen ice disturbed by the hot water drilling ) ; * because of the large absorption length , om spacings are similar , actually larger , than those of proposed water detectors .",
    "also , a typical event triggers 20 om s , not 6 . of these more than 5 photons",
    "are , on average ,  not scattered .",
    "\" a precise definition of  direct \" photons will be given further on . in the end , reconstruction is therefore as before , although additional information can be extracted from scattered photons by minimizing a likelihood function which matches measured and expected delays@xcite .",
    "the measured arrival directions of background cosmic ray muon tracks , reconstructed with 5 or more unscattered photons , are confronted with their known angular distribution in fig .",
    "there is an additional cut in fig .",
    "6 which simply requires that the track , reconstructed from timing information , actually traces the spatial positions of the om s in the trigger .",
    "the power of this cut , especially for events distributed over only 4 strings , is very revealing .",
    "it can be shown that , in a kilometer - scale detector , geometrical track reconstruction using only the positions of triggered om s is sufficient to achieve degree accuracy in zenith angle .",
    "we conclude from fig .",
    "6 that the agreement between data and monte carlo simulation is adequate .",
    "less than one in @xmath9 tracks is misreconstructed as originating below the detector@xcite .",
    "visual inspection reveals that the remaining misreconstructed tracks are mostly showers , radiated by muons or initiated by electron neutrinos , misreconstructed as up - going tracks of muon neutrino origin . at the @xmath14 level of the background",
    ", candidate events can be identified ; see fig .  7 .",
    "this exercise establishes that amanda-80 can be operated as a neutrino detector ; misreconstructed showers can be readily eliminated on the basis of the additional information on the amplitude of om signals .",
    "monte carlo simulation , based on this exercise , confirms that amanda-300 is a @xmath0  m@xmath1 detector with 2.5 degrees mean angular resolution@xcite .",
    "we have verified the angular resolution of amanda-80 by reconstructing muon tracks registered in coincidence with a surface air shower array spase@xcite .",
    "figure  8 demonstrates that the zenith angle distribution of the coincident spase - amanda cosmic ray beam reconstructed by the surface array is quantitatively reproduced by reconstruction of the muons in amanda .",
    "we have performed a search@xcite for upcoming neutrinos from the center of the earth .",
    "one should keep in mind that the preliminary results are obtained with only 80 oms , incomplete calibration and only 6 months of data .",
    "we nevertheless obtain limits near the competitive level of less than 1 event per @xmath15 per year for wimp masses in excess of 100  gev . with calibration of amanda-300",
    "completed and 1 year of data on tape , we anticipate a sensitivity beyond the limit shown in fig .  1 . increased sensitivity results from : lower threshold , better calibration ( factor of 3 ) , improved angular resolution ( factor of @xmath22 ) , longer exposure and , finally , an effective area larger by over one order of magnitude .",
    "recall that , because the search is limited by atmospheric neutrino background , sensitivity only grows as the square root of the effective area .",
    "we reconstructed 6 months of filtered amanda-80 events subject to the conditions that 8 oms report a signal in a time window of 2 microseconds . while the detector accumulated data at a rate of about 20  hz , filtered events passed cuts@xcite which indicate that time flows upwards through the detector . in collider experiments",
    "this would be referred to as a level 3 trigger .",
    "the narrow , long amanda-80 detector ( which constitutes the 4 inner strings of amanda-300 ) thus achieves optimal efficiency for muons pointing back towards the center of the earth which travel vertically upwards through the detector . because of edge effects the efficiency , which is , of course , a very strong function of detector size , is only a few percent after final cuts , even in the vertical direction",
    "nevertheless , we will identify background atmospheric neutrinos and establish meaningful limits on wimp fluxes from the center of the earth .",
    "= 4.3 in    that this data set , including prefiltering , is relatively well simulated by the monte carlo is shown in fig .",
    "the results reinforce the conclusions , first drawn from figs .  6 and 8 , that we understand the performance of the detector .",
    "cuts are on the number of `` direct '' photons , i.e.  photons which arrive within time residuals of @xmath16 $ ]  ns relative to the predicted time .",
    "the latter is the time it takes for cherenkov photons to reach the om from the reconstructed muon track .",
    "the choice of residual reflects the present resolution of our time measurements and allows for delays of slightly scattered photons .",
    "the reconstruction capability of amanda-80 is illustrated in fig .",
    "comparison of the reconstructed zenith angle distribution of atmospheric muons and the monte carlo is shown in fig .",
    "10a for 3 cuts in @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 , the resolution is 2.2  degrees as shown in fig .",
    "= 3.56 in    = 3.56 in    the final cut selecting wimp candidates requires 6 or more residuals in the interval @xmath19 $ ]  ns and @xmath20  m / ns . here",
    "@xmath21 is the slope parameter obtained from a plane wave fit @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the vertical coordinates of hit oms and @xmath24 the times at which they were hit .",
    "the two events surviving these cuts are shown in fig .",
    "their properties are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the expected number of atmospheric neutrino events passing the same cuts is @xmath25 . with only preliminary calibration ,",
    "the systematic error in the time - calibration of the pmts is @xmath215 ns . this reduces the number of expected events to @xmath26 .",
    "the fact that the parameters of both events are not close to the cuts imposed , reinforces their significance as genuine neutrino candidates .",
    "their large tracklengths suggest neutrino energies in the vicinity of 100  gev which implies that the parent neutrino directions should align with the measured muon track to better than 2  degrees .",
    "conservatively , we conclude that we observe 2 events on a background of 4.8 atmospheric neutrinos . with standard statistical techniques",
    "this result can be converted into an upper limit on an excess flux of wimp origin ; see fig .",
