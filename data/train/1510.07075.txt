    "dwarf galaxies are known to be the most numerous type of galaxy in general .",
    "additionally , dwarf galaxy accretion has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms in the formation of massive galaxies , such as the milky way ( mw ) @xcite . while the notion of mw halo build - up from systems resembling modern day dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) has encountered significant contention recently from element abundance ratio comparisons with the galaxy @xcite and the oosterhoff dichotomy @xcite , accretion of dwarfs",
    "has certainly occurred , with the sagittarius dsph providing a smoking gun for such interactions @xcite .",
    "studying the stellar populations of local group ( lg ) dwarfs , especially the old ones , allows us to better constrain the extent to which these dwarfs have contributed to the galactic halo .",
    "dwarf galaxies also present unique astrophysical laboratories to study how these relatively simple galaxies have evolved in different environments through their chemical enrichment and star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "variable stars are important tracers of the histories of dwarf galaxies .",
    "they provide unique insights into their parental stellar populations through the study of their light curves .",
    "cepheid and rr lyrae variables are especially useful in this context .",
    "for instance , classical cepheids ( ccs ) are massive , blue - loop stars that are relatively young , having formed within the past @xmath91 gyr @xcite .",
    "therefore these stars trace young star formation events . on the other hand ,",
    "rr lyrae stars are ancient horizontal branch ( hb ) stars originating from low - mass stars , and thus trace star formation at ages @xmath1010 gyr ( see figs . 2 and 3 of @xcite for theoretical modeling of rr lyrae stars on the hb and @xcite for an age determination of the youngest known system harboring rr lyrae stars ) .",
    "anomalous cepheids ( acs ) are thought to represent more intermediate - mass stars at low metallicities .",
    "they may trace intermediate age ( 1 - 6 gyr ) populations or old binary systems @xcite .",
    "the mere presence of any combination of these stars thus provides constraints on the sfh of the host system .",
    "in addition to informing the sfh of a stellar population , pulsating variables also provide insight into the chemical enrichment of such a population .",
    "most notably , there are strong correlations between the light curve shapes of fundamental mode rr lyrae , referred to in the literature as rrab stars , and their iron abundances , [ fe / h ] @xcite",
    ". similar relationships for cepheids have recently been explored @xcite .",
    "therefore , these stars provide a means to elucidate portions of the chemical enrichment history of a stellar population without the need for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the lg dsph / irr transition - type ( dtrans ; see @xcite ) galaxy , ddo210 ( aquarius ) , is one of the most distant dwarf galaxies in the lg .",
    "while distance estimates to this galaxy have differed significantly over the past few decades , recent values have converged on a distance of @xmath11 mpc using the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) @xcite .",
    "this galaxy is one of the most isolated in the lg and thus provides an excellent opportunity to study how such low - mass , isolated dwarfs evolve .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a synthetic colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) analysis of the sfh of ddo210 using their @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath12)/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) observations ( go-12925 ; pi : a. cole ) .",
    "they find a complex sfh over the lifetime of ddo210 characterized by a long delay before the onset of a major star burst @xmath97 gyr ago and followed by a relative lull in star formation for the past @xmath95 gyr .",
    "the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) produced by their analysis reveals very little chemical enrichment throughout its lifetime .    the goal of this work is to identify and characterize the pulsating variable stars within ddo210 , thereby constraining its evolutionary history . in section [ sec : obs ] , we describe the data used for this study , and the reduction process performed on them .",
    "we detail the variable star identification and characterization processes in section [ sec : var ] .",
    "we present the properties of the rr lyrae and cepheid stars in sections [ sec : rrl ] and [ sec : ceph ] respectively . a discussion of the properties of these stars within the context of the sfh of ddo210 is given in section [ sec : disc ] , and the conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the data set used by @xcite is very deep and covers a time baseline conducive to identifying short - period variable stars . these observations of ddo210 were originally intended for use in a detailed sfh analysis for this dwarf , and thus cover a significant portion of the galaxy while reaching photometric depths to the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "the observations consisting of 22,920 seconds in f475w and 33,480 seconds in f814w were taken with a cadence well - suited for identifying short - period variable stars .",
    "we retrieved these images from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) for use in our study .",
    "we downloaded the charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) corrected ( @xmath13 ) images from mast , which were also processed through the standard @xmath12 pipeline .",
    "bad pixels were then masked and the geometric correction pixel area maps were applied to each image .",
    "photometry was then performed using the daophot / allstar / allframe software packages @xcite .",
    "empirical point - spread functions ( psfs ) were constructed using the brightest isolated stars in one cosmic - ray rejected reference image for each filter using the corresponding task in daophot .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated from bright , isolated stars on each chip . the median aperture correction for these stars",
    "was then applied to all stars .",
    "we noticed a small photometric offset between the wfc1 and wfc2 chips after the aperture correction , and placed the wfc2 photometry on the same scale as the wfc1 photometry for consistency .",
    "the offsets amounted to 0.1 mag in f475w and -0.05 mag in f814w .",
    "we chose to correct wfc2 to the photometric system on wfc1 after comparison of our cmds with that of @xcite , who used the same data set , revealed that the wfc1 photometry agreed with theirs .",
    "we attribute this error to the lack of bright , isolated stars in the wfc2 field with which to obtain an accurate aperture correction value .",
    "finally , conversion of the native @xmath12 vegamag photometry to the ground - based johnson - cousins b and i filters was accomplished using the prescription from @xcite .",
    "in order to identify potential variable stars within the photometry , we first applied cuts in magnitude and colour in order to narrow our region of interest . since the primary goal of this work is to characterize the pulsating variable star content within the instability strip , we determined stars within @xmath14 mag @xmath15 m@xmath16 mag and 0 @xmath15 m@xmath17m@xmath18 mag to be an appropriate region of interest .",
    "potential variables were identified using a reduced @xmath19 defined as : @xmath20\\ ] ] in this case , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the f475w and f814w magnitudes in the vegamag photometric system . in an effort to filter spurious variables , we rejected 3-@xmath23 outliers from the @xmath19 calculation for each light curve .",
    "stars with @xmath24 were flagged as variable candidates .",
    "the raw light curve of one of the variable candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raw_obs ] .",
    "this light curve illustrates the high quality of these data for identifying variable stars .",
    "table [ tbl : timephot ] provides the full , time - series photometry for this star , and the photometry for all variable candidates is available in the online version of the journal .",
    ".an example time - series photometry set for one variable star candidate in ddo210 .",
    "the full set of these for all variable star candidates is included in the online version of the journal.[tbl : timephot ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once we identified our set of variable candidates , we then removed data points from each light curve with anomalously high errors ( @xmath25 mag ) to ensure a final sample of high fidelity light curves .",
    "analysis of these light curves was then performed using template light curve fitting .",
    "this method , based largely off the technique originated by @xcite , caters well to data sets with sparse or irregular time sampling and large gaps .",
    "we use ` rrfit ` @xcite to perform the light curve fitting . to summarize the method , ` rrfit ` performs a robust search through the user defined parameter space of expected pulsational properties to find the best - fitting light curve template for each star .",
    "the program does so by thoroughly searching the defined period space and generating potential light curves based upon the supplied templates at each period using the genetic algorithm , pikaia @xcite , to optimize each template to fit the data .",
    "each light curve fit is then ranked according to its reduced @xmath19 , and the parameters that minimize this value are taken to be the best - fitting light curve .    given previous studies of the stellar populations and sfh in ddo210 , we expect there to be a sizable population of rr lyrae variables as well as cepheid variables .",
    "considering this , we performed a first - pass with ` rrfit ` on our entire set of variable candidates searching for periods in the range 0.21.0 days , which allowed us to distinguish between potential faint , short - period stars and the brighter stars with presumably longer periods .",
    "following this first pass , we divided the sample into two groups by making a cut in f814w at 24.25 mag .",
    "variables fainter than this were taken as rr lyrae candidates , while brighter variables were assigned as cepheid candidates .",
    "we then ran a second round of ` rrfit ` on each set of variable candidates , this time tailoring the pulsational paramater space to match each type of variable . in the case of the cepheid candidates , we searched for periods in the range of 0.44.0 days , covering the period distributions for the different subclasses of cepheids found in lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "we chose to use the rr lyrae templates for the cepheids since the light curve shapes are similar .",
    "for the rr lyrae candidates , we searched for periods in the usual range of 0.21.0 days .",
    "we took advantage of the relationship between pulsation amplitudes in different bandpasses for the rr lyrae stars as discussed in @xcite in order to improve the template fitting procedure for these stars .",
    "@xcite provide these relationships in the johnson ",
    "cousins system for the b , v , and i filters . in order to derive similar transformations for the vegamag photometric system , we used the following technique",
    ". first , we generated 4,000 artificial rr lyrae light curves using the templates in ` rrfit ` .",
    "these artificial light curves were generated with the following constraint on their amplitudes from @xcite : @xmath26 we then transformed these light curves to the vegamag magnitudes in f475w and f814w using the prescription from @xcite at each phase in the light curve .",
    "finally , the amplitudes in f475w and f814w were calculated for each synthetic light curve , and the following linear relation was fit to these amplitudes : @xmath27 equation ( [ eq : ampconstvgm ] ) thus provides a constraint on the amplitudes of the rr lyrae candidates in the vegamag photometric system .",
    "we modified ` rrfit ` to implement this constraint in order to improve the accuracy of the rr lyrae fitting routine . on the other hand , for cepheids",
    "it has been known for some time that the amplitude ratio @xmath28 mag is independent of period or amplitude @xcite .",
    "however , the findings of @xcite suggest a possible dependence of @xmath29 on period , so we did not implement any such amplitude constraint on the cepheid candidates .    finally , we performed multiple checks on these best - fitting light curve to assess their validity .",
    "for the rr lyrae stars , the locations in the bailey ( period - amplitude ) diagram was checked to verify that each light curve s period , amplitude , and mode follow the well - known behavior of rr lyrae stars in this space .",
    "we manually checked for potential aliasing by visually examining all light curves produced by ` rrfit ` .",
    "light curves with periods suspected to be aliased were checked with the interactive light curve fitting program , ` fitlc ` @xcite .",
    "this software operates on the same principles as ` rrfit ` but provides a gui for the user to examine the light curves and the period-@xmath19 space .",
    "this program illustrates the best - fitting light curve for each template overplotted on the data , along with a plot of reduced @xmath19 versus period for each template . in this way , ` fitlc ` allows one to explore different period / template combinations . occasionally , the automated fitting routine misclassifies a star or falls victim to a period alias .",
    "aliased periods can be compared with other periods lying at a similar @xmath19 minimum .",
    "if a fit appears anomalous on the bailey diagram ( e.g. significantly shorter / longer period at a given amplitude compared with the other rr lyrae stars on the diagram ) , or a period - folded light curve appears to have a large gap , the fit period is usually aliased with two or more comparable @xmath19 minima . using fitlc , we explored the different periods with similarly low @xmath19 for these problematic light curves .",
    "if one of these other periods yields light curve parameters that better match the data and/or previously observed behavior for that type of variable ( e.g. period - amplitude relation ) , then that period is taken as the correct one .",
    "we will hereafter refer to this procedure as manual fitting .",
    "stars which failed to pass this vetting procedure with reasonable properties were removed from the sample .",
    "this left 107 ( 75 cepheid ; 32 rr lyrae ) high confidence variable stars in our sample .",
    "manual fitting with ` fitlc ` was required for 4 rr lyrae stars and 7 cepheids , accounting for 10% of our total pulsating variable sample .",
    "the cmd locations of our final variable star sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_cmd ] .",
    "some example light curves of each of these variables , folded with the best - fitting period , are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : clc ] and [ fig : rlc ] .",
    "properties of each of these candidate pulsators are presented in table [ tbl : varprops ] .",
    "we performed artificial light curve simulations to assess the accuracy and precision of our automated fitting procedure on this data set ( see ordoez , yang , & sarajedini ( 2014 ) and references therein ) .",
    "this involved using the fourier templates from ` rrfit ` to create artificial light curves .",
    "the properties of these artificial light curves were chosen to best represent the types of pulsating variables found in ddo210 .",
    "we sampled the appropriate period , amplitude , magnitude , and colour ranges in which the rr lyrae and cepheids were found to lie .",
    "each of these properties was sampled from a uniform distribution and assigned to each individual light curve .",
    "for the artificial rr lyrae light curves , the amplitude constraint in equation ( [ eq : ampconstvgm ] ) was applied .",
    "observations on these artificial f475w , f814w light curves were then simulated utilizing the cadence of our dataset and realistic photometric errors .    unlike the other studies employing these artificial light curve simulations",
    ", we have accounted for ranges in magnitude and colour , utilizing the photometric errors as a function of magnitude in each the f475w and f814w bands .",
    "we modeled the photometric error function as a constant value for bright magnitudes , and an exponential function for fainter magnitudes .",
    "this model was then fit to the errors from each individual photometric measurement for every star in our sample . in this way",
    ", we were able to realistically assess how our light curve analysis accuracy and completeness vary as a function of magnitude .",
    "once the simulated observations were generated , we then input these into ` rrfit ` exactly as we did for our real light curves .",
    "the difference between the synthetic input and best - fitting light curve parameters for each artificial light curve then gives estimates of the uncertainties inherent in the fitting procedure .",
    "we show the results of these simulations for the cepheid , rrab , and rrc stars in fig . [",
    "fig : simres ] .        given that these data cover a baseline of @xmath92.5 days , it is expected that periods greater than this to be recovered with significantly less accuracy than for shorter periods .",
    "this is clearly visible in the cepheid simulations .",
    "however , for periods shorter than 2.5 days , the period errors remain constant and reasonably small . only 3 of the 75 cepheid candidates were fit with periods longer than 2.5 days , and the longest period cepheid ( 5.15 days ) was fit manually in fitlc since it fell outside of the explored period range .",
    "therefore , we expect the observing baseline to affect the periods of only 2 out of the 107 variables in our sample .    to gauge the quantitative uncertainties inherent in the fitting routine from these simulations , we perform the following statistical test discussed in @xcite . from our sample of artificial light curves",
    ", we sample the corresponding number of identified stars ( 75 cepheid ; 24 rrab : 8 rrc ) and calculate the average error in the light curve parameters ( @xmath30p , @xmath30a@xmath31 , etc . ) .",
    "this sampling is repeated 10,000 times to build a statistical distribution of the expected errors .",
    "these distributions then represent good estimators for the systematic and random errors inherent in the fitting procedure .",
    "specifically , the peak of the distribution reveals any systematic errors , and the spread estimates the random uncertainties ( standard error ) in each parameter .",
    "gaussian fits to the final error distributions therefore yield our fiducial uncertainty values .",
    "these uncertainties are presented in table [ tbl : err ] for each type of simulated variable . since only 2 cepheids will be affected by the large uncertainties at p@xmath322.5 days , we restricted this test to artificial light curves with periods less than this value .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out that for most of the simulated light curve parameters , the systematic errors are smaller than the random errors .",
    "however , the simulations reveal that we may be underestimating the amplitudes for the cepheid and rrab light curves by 0.02 and 0.04 mag , respectively .",
    "we tested to see if this affected the metallicity estimates for the rrab stars ( see section [ sub : rrab_met ] ) by subtracting this offset from the amplitudes , and it turned out to drive the metallicity estimates higher by @xmath90.05 dex . considering that this is smaller than the other sources of uncertainty for this calculation , we do not expect these errors to impact the main results of this paper significantly .",
    "the relative paucity of rr lyrae stars in ddo210 , especially compared with the younger cepheids , is fully consistent with the appearance of its cmd .",
    "the red hb morphology and strong red clump ( rc ) in this galaxy indiciate a younger average age for the stellar population .",
    "the small number of rr lyrae stars implies a weaker star formation rate at times @xmath3310 gyr ago , which is fully consistent with the appearance of the other features .",
    "this agrees well with the synthetic cmd , sfh analysis of @xcite .",
    "their fig .",
    "4 shows a distinct minimum just before a lookback time of 10 gyr .",
    "in addition to providing insights into the sfh of a galaxy , the rr lyrae stars also inform us regarding the chemical enrichment of their host system through their metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) . as discussed in section [ sec : intro ] , many studies have provided methods of calculating an iron abundance , [ fe / h ] , from the shape of the light curves of rr lyrae stars .",
    "considering that the dataset employed in this study is not well - suited for a fourier analysis on each light curve , we utilized the relation of @xcite to calculate [ fe / h ] for each individual rrab star : @xmath34 } = -8.85[log p_{ab } + 0.15a_v ] - 2.60\\ ] ] since we did not have @xmath35 band imaging for these stars , we opted to estimate @xmath36 for each rrab star using the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 from @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rrab_mdf ] shows the rrab mdf calculated using both the @xmath39-band and @xmath40-band amplitudes .",
    "the mdfs show no significant difference , and the mean metallicity in each case is @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath41 dex using @xmath38 and @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath42 dex using @xmath37 , both in full agreement .",
    "we thus take a singular estimate by averaging these two values together to obtain @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath43 dex . assuming the effects of @xmath44-enhancement are small",
    ", this also agrees with the amr from the synthetic cmd analysis of @xcite .",
    "their fig .",
    "5 shows this amr , and at a lookback time of approximately 11 gyr , this average metallicity is [ m / h ] @xmath45 dex .",
    "the rrab stars , which formed at approximately this time , support the results of the analysis of @xcite .",
    "an important diagnostic of an rr lyrae population is the bailey ( period - amplitude ) diagram .",
    "we show this for the 32 rr lyrae stars within ddo210 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] . also plotted in this figure",
    "are the loci for the two different oosterhoff populations in the galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) from cacciari , corwin , & carney ( 2005 ) . while most of the rrab stars lie around the oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) locus , their mean period @xmath3p@xmath46 d and mean metallicity @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath43 dex place this galaxy in the so - called oosterhoff gap , along with the majority of dsph galaxies .",
    "additionally , the first - overtone to fundamental mode population ratio , ( rrc)/(rrc + rrab ) = 0.25 , is consistent with an oosterhoff - intermediate classification for this galaxy .",
    "the discrepancy between the appearance of the bailey diagram and the other oosterhoff classification methods have been noted in previous studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss this issue in detail , and conclude that the absence of high - amplitude , short - period ( hasp ) rrab stars in dsph and ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies present a fundamental difference between the ancient rr lyrae population in dsph / ufds and those in the ggcs and galactic halo .",
    "this hasp absence , which @xcite attribute to the metal - poor environments forming the rr lyrae stars , skews the mean rrab period to longer values .",
    "therefore , it seems that ddo210 hosts an rr lyrae population similar to the dsph and ufds in the lg owing to their similarly metal - poor environments at early ages .",
    "the distance to ddo210 has been a matter of some debate since its discovery .",
    "most recent distance estimates to this galaxy using the trgb place ddo210 at a distance modulus of @xmath47 @xcite , and the most recent synthetic cmd analysis by @xcite report a distance modulus of @xmath48 .",
    "we now compute the distance to ddo210 using the period - luminosity - metallicity ( plz ) relation from @xcite : @xmath49 using the rrab metallicities from section [ sub : rrab_met ] calculated with the @xmath39-band amplitudes , we convert to log@xmath50 using the following relation : @xmath51 - 1.765 $ ] to remain consistent with @xcite .",
    "again , here we have not corrected for the effects of @xmath44-enhancement in the absence of a strong constraint for [ @xmath44/fe ] for these stars .",
    "apparent mean magnitudes of these rrab stars have been corrected for extinction using @xmath52 mag from @xcite for ddo210 retrieved from ned .",
    "the mean distance modulus of the rrab stars calculated in this way is @xmath53 where the error bar represents one standard deviation .",
    "we note that the effects of different helium abundances on this rr lyrae plz relation have not been fully explored , and significant helium abundance in the ddo210 rr lyrae stars could present a significant systematic error in this distance determination .",
    "there may also be some systematic error resulting from @xmath44-enhancement when calculating log@xmath50 . even considering these uncertainties ,",
    "our rr lyrae distance is roughly consistent with other distance determinations to this galaxy within the uncertainties .",
    "the rr lyrae distance does however seem to lie on the farther end of the distribution of previous distance measurements .",
    "in fact , our distance is closer to that of @xcite ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we now turn to discussing a few anomalous rr lyrae candidates within our sample .",
    "the cmd of ddo210 in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_cmd ] shows two bright outliers in the rr lyrae population near @xmath55 mag and colours of ( f475w - f814w ) @xmath56 and ( f475w - f814w ) @xmath57 mag .",
    "neither of these rrc stars appear as outliers in the bailey diagram , nor do they display anomalous light curves .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : var_cmd ] that most of the rr lyrae candidates that we identified occupy the expected region in the cmd , except for the two aforementioned bright outliers lie clearly brighter the hb .",
    "in fact , these stars appear to lie in between the bulk rr lyrae population and the cepheids .",
    "it is possible that these stars are faint acs , but this seems unlikely given their separation from the bulk cepheid population in the cmd and pl relations ( see section [ sec : ceph ] for a full discussion of the cepheids ) .",
    "we also considered the possibility that these stars are type ii cepheids ( bl her ) stars , but ruled this out because bl her stars generally have periods between 1 and 4 days ( these outliers both have periods near 0.4 days ) .",
    "another possibility is that these stars contain unresolved companions , making them appear brighter .",
    "this is more likely the case as cepheids with such short periods are uncommon .",
    "one more peculiar rr lyrae candidate deserves discussion . immediately apparent upon examining fig .",
    "[ fig : bailey ] is the one outlying rrab star near the ooii locus .",
    "the longest period rr lyrae in our sample , this star is also the most metal - poor rrab star . while it is tempting to discard this star as a contaminating type ii or anomalous cepheid , we note that this star lies right on the hb ( @xmath58 mag ) in the cmd near the red end of the rr lyrae gap .",
    "it may therefore be a very metal - poor rr lyrae star formed within ddo210 .",
    "considering once again the analysis of @xcite for comparison , we see that the amr for the galaxy has the largest metallicity dispersion at a lookback time of 11 gyr , corresponding to the age of the rr lyrae stars .",
    "in fact , the rms metallicity range for that time bin extends down to metallicities of [ m / h ] @xmath59 dex .",
    "therefore , such a metal - poor rr lyrae star is not inconsistent with the synthetic cmd analysis of @xcite .",
    "the cepheid variables dominate the pulsators found in ddo210 . however , as other authors have pointed out @xcite , this region of the cmd hosting these stars is degenerate . that is to say that stellar populations with different masses and metallicites can occupy this region , including the cepheid instability strip . in low - metallicity environments",
    ", this makes distinction between these dfferent populations difficult .",
    "we note that no cepheids with periods longer than @xmath95 days were identified in our data . given the quality of the data at these bright magnitudes , we expect to flag variability at these longer periods even with incomplete phase coverage . therefore , this absence of longer period cepheids is more likely a reflection of the cepheid population itself rather than an observational bias .    to further complicate matters , recent investigations of the cepheid populations in dwarf galaxies",
    "have revealed that the distinction between acs and ccs is not as clear as once thought .",
    "these studies have found that the period and luminosity distributions of these two types of variables can overlap , making a separation based on this diagram alone difficult @xcite .",
    "one other way to potentially distinguish between a population of ccs and acs is to utilize our theoretical understanding of acs .",
    "since acs are stars with masses less than the transition mass between partial - degenerate , central he burning and quiescent central he burning , one can compare the positions of stellar evolutionary tracks near this mass ( @xmath92.1 m@xmath60 for [ fe / h]@xmath610.7 dex ) with the observed cepheid population @xcite .",
    "we have performed this analysis for the cepheids in ddo210 , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceph_cmd ] .",
    "this shows the cmd of ddo210 highlighting the cepheid variables .",
    "the magnitudes have been converted to absolute magnitudes using the rr lyrae distance modulus from section [ sub : rrab_mu ] , and colours de - reddened using the reddening to ddo210 from @xcite . to attempt to deduce the nature of the cepheids in ddo210 ,",
    "we have plotted the he - burning stages of the canonical , scaled - solar evolutionary tracks for stars of different masses ( 1.8 , 2.1 , 2.8 , 3.0 , 3.5 , and 5.0 m@xmath60 ; coloured lines in [ fig : ceph_cmd ] ) and two different metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath62 dex and [ fe / h ] @xmath63 dex ; left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceph_cmd ] , respectively ) from the basti stellar evolutionary library @xcite .",
    "we did not explore lower metallicities because such stars are deemed unlikely to have been formed within the past 6 gyr considering the amr from @xcite . on the other hand , acs",
    "are not expected to reach metallicities above [ fe / h ] @xmath63 dex because they do not enter the instability strip above this metallicity , so higher metallicity tracks were not explored either .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : ceph_cmd ] , it is evident that the brighter cepheids in this galaxy are clearly ccs , irrespective of the metallicity adopted for these stars .",
    "we have identified these stars as lying near or brighter than the 2.8 m@xmath60 track in both cases ( the triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceph_cmd ] ) . the remaining cepheids cluster around the 2.1 m@xmath60 track for the lower metallicity case but not the higher metallicity case .",
    "thus , we are presented with a situation similar to what @xcite found in leo i. that is , the nature of the cepheids in ddo210 seems to depend on the metallicity of these stars . if they are sufficiently metal - poor , which @xcite indicate is possible calculating @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath64 dex for ddo210 , it is likely that many of the fainter cepheids are acs . on the other hand ,",
    "if these stars are all characterized by a slightly higher metallicity , as is suggested by the amr of @xcite for ages @xmath616 gyr , then these cepheids should all be ccs .",
    "the locations of these stars in the cmd coupled with the amr from @xcite indicate that most if not all of these stars are in fact ccs . in an attempt to place furter constraints on the nature of these cepheids ,",
    "we show the @xmath65 and reddening - free , wesenheit pl relations in fig .",
    "[ fig : bwpl ] .",
    "again , we have used the rr lyrae distance modulus and extinctions as before to convert to absolute magnitudes .",
    "we have taken several pl relations from the literature for ccs and acs to compare with the cepheids in ddo210 .",
    "for the ccs , we use the @xmath40-band pl relation from @xcite for short - period ccs . as for the acs",
    ", we use the @xmath40-band pl relation from @xcite .",
    "although there is a considerable amount of scatter , it appears that the likely ccs identified using fig .",
    "[ fig : ceph_cmd ] ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : bwpl ] ; see section [ sub : evo ] ) do follow the cc pl relations . as for the fainter cepheids ,",
    "the picture is again unclear .",
    "the faintest of these do seem to aggregate near the ac pl relations , but there is enough scatter to confuse the distinction for most of them .",
    "@xmath66{m_b0_pl.pdf } &      \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{wb0_pl.pdf }    \\end{array}$ ]    the wesenheit magnitudes inherently remove the effects of reddening to stars @xcite . to calculate wesenheit magnitudes , we use the following equation : @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the ratio of total - to - selective absorption , @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "we have constructed @xmath70 pl relations using the @xmath40-band pl relations previously mentioned combined with the @xmath39-band relations of @xcite for the acs , @xcite for the fundamental mode ccs , and @xcite for the first - overtone ccs .",
    "we note that we needed to place the first - overtone cc pl relation on the same scale as the fundamental mode one by subtracting 18.449 mag from the first - overtone cc pl relation of @xcite .",
    "this was necessary because this pl relation was not corrected for reddening , but @xcite did not provide a first - overtone pl relation .",
    "thus , subtracting the difference between the fundamental mode zero - points of @xcite and @xcite places the first - overtone @xmath71 pl relation on the same scale as the fundamental mode one . to construct the wesenheit pl relation for the different types of cepheids , we took the @xmath40 and @xmath39 pl relations at a given period , and calculated @xmath70 using equation ( [ eq : wes ] ) .",
    "the result , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bwpl ] , has clearly reduced the scatter in the ddo210 cepheid pl relation .",
    "while these two pl relations lie close in this wesenheit plane , it appears that most of the cepheids lie brighter than the ac pl relations and closer to the cc pl relations in this plane .",
    "additionally , we observe the possible ac candidates ( circles ) as determined by the cmd analysis in section [ sub : evo ] to lie on the same pl relation for the likely ccs ( stars ) extended to fainter magnitudes .",
    "this would seem to support this cepheid population containing mostly , if not entirely , ccs . finally , we draw attention to the two bright outliers on the short - period end of the @xmath70 pl relation .",
    "these stars are more likely second - overtone cepheids since these pulsators have been observed to pulsate with shorter periods at a given magnitude when compared to the first - overtone pulsators .      the final test we perform to discern the nature of the cepheids in ddo210 is to examine the specific frequency of the potential acs .",
    "@xcite first noted that the specific frequency of acs ( number per 10@xmath72 l@xmath73 ) is strongly correlated with both the absolute visual magnitude and mean metallicity of mw satellite dsph .",
    "@xcite further extended the study of acs to dsph orbiting m31 and discovered those galaxies to follow the same trends .",
    "@xcite also note that phoenix , a dtrans , follows the same trends as the dsph , indicating that these relations may hold independent of galaxy morphological type .",
    "if we assume that this relation holds for all dwarf galaxies in the lg , then we expect the specific frequency of acs in ddo210 to follow these same trends .",
    "we have therefore calculated the ac specific frequency in ddo210 assuming all of the 58 potential acs identified in section [ sub : evo ] are bona fide acs . for this calculation , we have used an absolute magnitude of @xmath74 mag @xcite , a surveyed area fraction for this dataset of 50% @xcite , and mean metal abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath75 dex @xcite .",
    "we compare the ac specific frequency of ddo210 with the other dwarf galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig : acsf ] .",
    "clearly , ddo210 does not follow the same ac specific frequency trends as other lg dwarfs if we assume all potential acs to be real .",
    "in fact , for ddo210 to fall in line with the trend for other dwarfs , our sample of cepheids would need to contain @xmath762 acs .",
    "thus , we are left with two scenarios : 1 ) most or all of these ac candidates are indeed true acs , and the specific frequency trends do not hold for all dwarfs , or 2 ) the specific frequency trends do hold for ddo210 , and only @xmath762 of these cepheids are in fact acs . scenario 2 ) coupled with the amr of @xcite , the locations of the cepheids in the cmd , and the wesenheit pl relations for these cepheids lead us to conclude that the majority of the cepheids in this galaxy are ccs .",
    "the main goal of this work was to investigate the properties of the pulsating variables in the context of the sfh of ddo210 .",
    "the recent sfh analysis of @xcite provides an excellent comparison to this end .",
    "as we have already discussed , the metallicity of the rr lyrae stars derived in this work agrees well with the amr from @xcite at ages of @xmath911 gyr , but is inconsistent with their amr for ages @xmath3312.5 gyr .",
    "interestingly , their sfh shows a deep minimum in star formation rate at this 11 gyr time bin .",
    "those authors note that this drop is robust , and that the star formation rate at this time is only nonzero at the @xmath77 level .",
    "the presence of an rr lyrae population with a mean metallicity of @xmath3[fe / h]@xmath78 confirms a weak , but nonzero star formation rate during this early epoch in ddo210 .",
    "we now turn to discussing our results on the context of massive galactic halo formation .",
    "the paradigm for the formation of the mw halo has held that a large part of it has formed through the accretion of dwarf galaxies closely resembling those found in the lg today . extending this mechanism to other massive galaxies similar to the mw",
    ", it follows that the lg dwarfs should provide excellent windows to the systems that built many massive galaxies in general .",
    "however , as was pointed out in section [ sub : bailey ] , the rr lyrae populations in the dsph and ufds of the lg appear fundamentally different than those found in the mw halo and ggcs .",
    "@xcite attribute this difference to a difference in the metallicity of the ancient stellar populations from which the rr lyraes formed .",
    "they show that the dsph and ufds did not chemically enrich rapidly enough to produce the hasp rrab stars observed in the galactic halo , ggcs , and more massive dwarfs like the lmc and sgr .",
    "they find that galaxies need to have enriched to metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath62 dex or more before @xmath910 gyr in order to produce these hasp rrab stars .",
    "ddo210 appears to harbor an rr lyrae population lacking in hasp rrab stars , similar to the dsph and ufds .",
    "that these stars are metal - poor of the hasp threshold ( [ fe / h ] @xmath79 dex ; see section [ sub : rrab_met ] ) is in agreement with the picture provided by @xcite .",
    "those authors go on to estimate that no more than @xmath950% of the galactic halo mass could have accreted from these low - mass , metal - poor galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is still possible that some galaxies resembling ddo210 could be buried in the galactic halo .",
    "however , it seems that the contribution of isolated , low - luminosity dtrans like ddo210 is at a similar level to that of the dsph and ufds .",
    "considering the low level of early star - formation implied by the rr lyrae population and the isolation of ddo210 , we conclude that galaxies resembling this one probably did not contribute a significant amount of mass to the galactic halo .    regarding the cepheids , it is difficult to place strong constraints on the sfh from our sample given the unknown composition ( acs vs ccs ? ) .",
    "we have shown that most of this sample is likely cc , implying that these stars formed within the past 500 myr or so . to test this hypothesis further",
    ", we have applied the period - age relation from @xcite to our sample of cepheids .",
    "unfortunately , that study did not extend their exploration to metallicities as low as ddo210 .",
    "nevertheless , we continue with their most metal - poor period - age relation ( @xmath80 ) in an effort to gain rough insight into the ages of these stars .",
    "the two period - age relations for the fundamental and first - overtone cepheids take the form : @xmath81 @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the age of the cepheid in years .",
    "we used the wesenheit pl relation ( see section [ sub : pl ] ) in order to distinguish between fundamental and first - overtone cepheids .",
    "applying equations ( [ eq : fupa ] ) and ( [ eq : fopa ] ) to these sets of cepheids produced the age distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] .",
    "this distribution indicates that , if these stars are all ccs , then these stars all likely formed within the past gyr .",
    "thus , we can compare these stars properties with the sfh of @xcite again . if we assume for the sake of comparison that the errors introduced by using a period - age relation for more metal - rich stars are relatively small ( @xmath76100 myr )",
    ", then it seems that most of these stars were born around 300 myr ago .",
    "@xcite examine the sfh of the past 1 gyr in detail , and they find an enhancement in star formation rate at ages of 250 - 300 myr .",
    "thus under these assumptions , the properties of these cc candidates is fully consistent with their synthetic cmd analysis .",
    "we note that these ages are also in agreement with the analysis of @xcite where they compare theoretical isochrones to the position of the blue - loop stars on their @xmath35 , @xmath84 cmd .",
    "they find many of the blue - loop stars in ddo210 in the same region as our cepheid sample to be @xmath9300 myr old .",
    "the presence of stellar population gradients has been found to be a common characteristic of dwarf galaxies . in the case of ddo210 ,",
    "@xcite trace the distribution of different stellar populations and find that the radial profile of the young stars is different from the older rc and rgb stars . in particular , they find the youngest stars to confined to a small ( @xmath90.3 kpc ) clump roughly one arcminute east of the centre of ddo210 .",
    "we attempt to further examine this young star distribution through the radial distribution of the age of the cepheids . in order to estimate where the clump of young stars lies in our data",
    ", we took the centroid of all of the cepheids younger than 250 myr as our fiducial centre .",
    "the projected distances ( assuming a distance modulus calculated by the rr lyrae stars ) of the cepheids from this point are plotted against their ages in fig .",
    "[ fig : age_grad ] , and it reveals that the youngest cepheids are concentrated to within 0.4 kpc , consistent with the results of @xcite . on the other hand , cepheids older than 200 myr extend almost twice that range in distance .",
    "this point is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_err_ell ] , where we have plotted the 2 @xmath23 error ellipses for the mean positions of each variable star population .",
    "this plot shows that even with their larger error ellipse ( owing to their small number and wide spatial distribution ) , the young cepheids are significantly offset from the center of the galaxy and most of the other variable stellar populations .",
    "meanwhile , the older variables , namely cepheids older than 250 myr and the rr lyrae stars , are within 2 @xmath23 of the center of ddo210 .",
    "the young cepheid centroid is @xmath9 28(@xmath9140 pc ) from the centre of ddo210 , while the older cepheid centroid lies only @xmath9 6(@xmath930 pc ) from the centre .",
    "the mean positions and standard errors used to construct fig .",
    "[ fig : var_err_ell ] are provided in table [ tbl : var_xy_mean_err ] .",
    "interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig : var_err_ell ] is somewhat difficult with information available to us",
    ". this may indicate that the recent star formation has migrated away from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite already suggested that such a scenario may have occurred within ddo210 through the process described by @xcite for sextans a. to summarize the mechanism , star formation is induced on one edge of a gas cloud and thought to migrate through the cloud from instabilities triggered by the supernova and wind - driven shocks of the previous , adjacent star formation episodes .",
    "the cepheids appear consistent with such a scenario occurring with ddo210 , and in fact the centre of the youngest cepheids in our sample lies @xmath9 15(@xmath970 pc ) from the approximate centre of the young stars and corresponding h ` i ` dent ( black diamond in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_err_ell ] ) discussed in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the centre of the older cepheids in our sample lies much further from the centre of the young stars from @xcite at @xmath938(@xmath9180 pc ) .",
    "as @xcite point out , there are other alternatives to explain the offset of the young stars from the galactic centre . for instance",
    ", it is possible that ddo210 interacted with some nearby system which could have potentially induced star formation away from the centre .",
    "however , the isolation of this galaxy renders this scenario rather unlikely . another possibility that @xcite suggest is the recent capture of gas",
    "however , if this mechanism was responsible for the formation of the youngest stars , then one would not necessarily expect the metallicity of these youngest stars to be similar to the older cepheids unrelated to this captured gas .",
    "the fact that these cepheids all appear to constitute one continuous population in the cmd and pl plane indicate that they must be of similar chemical composition , and therefore formed from related star formation events .",
    "finally , another scenario one might imagine to explain the spatial distribution of cepheids in this galaxy is one in which all of these stars formed off - centre . in this case , the older cepheids will have had more time to migrate from the original site of star formation . during this dispersal ,",
    "the older stars have more time to be affected by the overall galactic potential , thereby orbiting the galactic centre as opposed to the natal star forming region . in the absence of any kinematic information for these stars",
    ", we can not confirm this scenario .",
    "we do however note that recent theoretical work has shown that significant radial stellar migration in dwarf galaxies is not expected to occur over these short time - scales @xcite .",
    "we should also note that such migrating star formation regions appear to occur within systems marked by solid - body rotation @xcite .",
    "as differential rotation acts to destroy substructure through shear , propagation of star formation across significant distances is less likely in such systems . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies with solid - body rotation allow for substructure to remain coherent for longer time periods , allowing this mechanism to more efficiently act .",
    "the galactic rotation curve for ddo210 from @xcite shows that the central few hundred parsecs of ddo210 are likely undergoing solid - body rotation , further supporting the possibility of migrating star formation in this galaxy .",
    "therefore , assuming these stars formed near where they are presently observed , we conclude the migrating star formation region the most likely explanation for the distribution of cepheids in ddo210 .",
    "using archival @xmath12/acs imaging of the lg dwarf ddo210 , we have detected over 100 pulsating variable stars within this dwarf . these consist of 32 rr lyrae stars and 75 cepheids .",
    "the properties of these pulsating variables have been compared to the sfh analysis of @xcite , showing that the sfh from @xcite is consistent with the properties of the rr lyrae and cepheid pulsators . in particular , we find the relatively small population of rr lyrae stars to corroborate a weak but nonzero star formation rate at ages of @xmath911 gyr .",
    "we find one particularly metal - poor rr lyrae that is also consistent with the large spread in the amr produced by @xcite for these old ages .",
    "we find the behavior of the rr lyrae stars in ddo210 to be consistent with those of other lg dwarfs in the period - amplitude plane .",
    "specifically , this dwarf can be considered an oo - intermediate system with a striking lack of hasp rrab stars .    as for the cepheids , we argue that the majority of these stars are short - period ccs , however we can not rule out the presence of some acs with the information available to us .",
    "we have utilized a period - age relation for ccs in order to estimate the ages of these young pulsators .",
    "we find a peak in the cepheid age distribution near 300 myr , which agrees well with the sfh from @xcite .",
    "the youngest of these cepheids lie offset from the older cepheids and the centre of the galaxy , confirming previous studies showing the young stars lie offset from the older stars in this galaxy .",
    "we conclude that this offset is likely resultant from a migration of star - formation , through a mechanism similar to what was proposed in @xcite .",
