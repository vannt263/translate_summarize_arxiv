    "one of the important tools to study properties of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is a qcd jet production .",
    "medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , the so - called jet quenching , has been proposed to be very different in cold nuclear matter and in qgp , resulting in many challenging observable phenomena  @xcite .",
    "recent rhic data on suppression of inclusive high - p@xmath6 charge and neutral hadron production from star  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , phobos  @xcite and brahms  @xcite are in agreement with the jet quenching hypothesis  @xcite",
    ". however direct event - by - event reconstruction of jets and their characteristics is not available in rhic experiments at the moment , while the assumption that integrated yield of all high-@xmath7 particles originates only from jet fragmentation is not obvious .    at lhc a new regime of heavy ion physics",
    "will be reached at @xmath8 tev where hard and semi - hard qcd multi - particle production can dominate over underlying soft events .",
    "the initial gluon densities in pb@xmath9pb reactions at lhc are expected to be significantly higher than at rhic , implying stronger partonic energy loss which can be observable in various new channels  @xcite . in particular , the potentially important process is production of a single jet opposite to a gauge boson in @xmath10jet  @xcite and @xmath11jet  @xcite or a virtual photon in @xmath12jet  @xcite final states , dominantly through processes such as @xmath13 in heavy ion collisions , the relative @xmath7 between the jet ( or leading particle in a jet ) and the boson becomes imbalanced due to interactions of the jet partons in the medium .    in the @xmath14jet case",
    "the main problem arises from the jet pair production background when a leading @xmath15 in the jet is misidentified as a photon .",
    "the `` photon isolation '' criteria usually used in @xmath16 collisions do not work with the same efficiency in high multiplicity heavy ion interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , the question of adequate using photon+jet correlation to study jet quenching requires further investigation . on the other hand ,",
    "the production of jet tagged by dileptons is not affected significantly by backgrounds and can be used to observe @xmath7-imbalance as a signal of medium - induced partonic energy loss .    in this letter",
    "we analyze dimuon+jet production ( including both @xmath17 modes ) in heavy ion collisions at the lhc . in sect .",
    "2 the cross section of this process is calculated by comphep monte - carlo generator and the expected event rate is estimated for realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts .",
    "3 describes shortly the model of partonic energy loss in qgp used to calculate @xmath7-imbalance between @xmath2 pair and jet ( or leading particle in a jet ) .",
    "discussion on numerical results and their experimental and theoretical uncertainties can be found in sect .  4 , summary - in sect .  5",
    "we use the comphep monte - carlo generator  @xcite for cross section calculation of dilepton+jet process and subsequent generation of event for this process .",
    "comphep is a general , tree level generator , which allows one to study almost all processes @xmath18 ( up to @xmath19 ) in the framework of the usual technique of feynman diagrams squared for different models ( sm , mssm , many other ... ) .",
    "it generates , squares and symbolically calculates a set of feynman diagrams for a given process and creates a numeric monte - carlo generator for the process .",
    "this mc generator allows one to compute cross sections ( with applied cuts ) , to build distributions and to generate events with partons in the final state ; the initial partons are convoluted with parton distribution functions ( pdf ) .",
    "for simplification of our calculation and event generation we apply a special _ hash_-model in comphep  @xcite . in this model a unitary rotation of down quarks transfers cabibbo - kabayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements from interaction vertices to parton distribution functions .",
    "it allows one to unify two light quark generations to one only . as a result ,",
    "this trick reduces significantly number of subprocesses which we need to take into account for the process .",
    "this model applies two approximations :    * @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) quarks are massless ; * @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks do not interact with light quarks and ckm matrix element @xmath28=1 .    in the problem of dilepton+jet investigation",
    "the influence of factors violating these conditions is very small so we can soundly use this approximation",
    ".    there are nine subprocesses contributed to the process of the dilepton+jet production in the framework of sm with _ hash_-approximation .",
    "feynman diagrams for the subprocesses are depicted on fig.1 .",
    "we use the following physics parameter values : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 gev , @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 gev , pdf are taken from cteq5l  @xcite .",
    "we apply a following set of `` loose '' cuts for event generation . in the further investigation",
    "these cuts have been strengthened :    * @xmath35 gev/@xmath22 and @xmath36 gev/@xmath22 ; * @xmath37 .",
    "we do not apply a cut on @xmath38 because of a singularity in the region @xmath39 is regularized by massiveness of muon .",
    "contributions of all subprocess to the total cross section is presented in the table  [ crosssections ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ crosssections ]    -5 mm    note that the cross section for the process @xmath2+jet was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite at rhic and lhc energies taking into account the @xmath40 contribution only .",
    "such approximation seems valid for rhic , but for lhc the contribution from @xmath41 and @xmath0 interference term are also significant .",
    "now we estimate the expected event rate for realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts . to be specific , the geometry of compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector is considered  @xcite : pseudo - rapidity coverage @xmath42 for jets and @xmath43 for muons .",
    "extra cuts @xmath44 gev/@xmath22 and @xmath45 gev were applied .",
    "then the corresponding @xmath16 cross section for @xmath46+jet production is @xmath47b , and pb@xmath9pb cross section is estimated as @xmath48b . the corresponding event rate in a one month pb@xmath9pb run ( assuming 15 days of data taking ) , @xmath49 s , with designed luminosity @xmath50@xmath51s@xmath52 , is @xmath53 in this case .",
    "note that potential using also @xmath54+jet channel could increase observed event rates by a factor @xmath55 and requires further investigation .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us discuss the potential background sources in the cms experimental situation .",
    "semileptonic heavy quark decays and uncorrelated pion and kaon decays are expected to give main contributions to the dimuon spectra at lhc energies , @xmath56 events in a one month pb@xmath9pb run for cms acceptance  @xcite .",
    "however , the request of hard enough cut on muon pair transverse momentum , @xmath44 gev , together with the additional trigger to have a hard jet with @xmath45 gev in the opposite hemisphere , makes such background `` contamination '' negligible .",
    "moreover , the experimental control on background extraction may be done by monitoring uncorrelated and correlated sources independently .",
    "the uncorrelated part can be subtracted using like - sign dimuon mass spectra , while the correlated part can be rejected using tracker information on the dimuon vertex position  @xcite .",
    "in order to generate the initial distributions of jets and @xmath57 pairs in nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions at @xmath58 tev , we have used comphep package for initial parton configuration setting and pythia@xmath59  @xcite for subsequent jet fragmentation . after specifying initial partonic state , event - by - event monte - carlo simulation of rescattering and energy loss of partons in qgp",
    "is performed ( for details of the model one can refer to  @xcite ) .",
    "the approach relies on accumulative energy losses , when gluon radiation is associated with each scattering in the expanding medium together with including the interference effect by the modified radiation spectrum @xmath60 as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath61 . the basic kinetic integral equation for the energy loss @xmath62 as a function of initial energy @xmath63 and path length @xmath64 has the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the current transverse coordinate of a parton , @xmath67 is the scattering probability density , @xmath60 is the energy loss per unit length , @xmath68 is in - medium mean free path , @xmath69 is the medium density at the temperature @xmath61 , @xmath70 is the integral cross section of parton interaction in the medium .",
    "such a numerical simulation of the free path of a hard jet in qgp allows any kinematic characteristic distributions of jets in the final state to be obtained .",
    "the collisional energy loss due to elastic scattering with high - momentum transfer have originally been estimated by bjorken in  @xcite , and recalculated later in  @xcite taking also into account the loss with low - momentum transfer dominated by the interactions with plasma collective modes . since the latter process contributes to the total collisional loss without the large factor @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the debye screening mass ) in comparison with high - momentum scattering and it can be effectively `` absorbed '' by the redefinition of minimal momentum transfer @xmath73 under the numerical estimates , we used the collisional part with high - momentum transfer only  @xcite , @xmath74 and the dominant contribution to the differential cross section @xmath75 for scattering of a parton with energy @xmath63 off the `` thermal '' partons with energy ( or effective mass ) @xmath76 .",
    "here @xmath77 for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 scatterings respectively , @xmath81 is the qcd running coupling constant for @xmath82 active quark flavors , and @xmath83 is the qcd scale parameter which is of the order of the critical temperature , @xmath84 mev . the integrated cross section @xmath70 is regularized by the debye screening mass squared @xmath85 .",
    "there are several calculations of the inclusive energy distribution of medium - induced gluon radiation from feyman multiple scattering diagrams .",
    "the relation between these approaches and their main parameters were discussed in details in the recent writeup of the working group `` jet physics '' for the cern yellow report  @xcite .",
    "we restrict to ourself here by using bdms formalism  @xcite . in the bdms framework",
    "the strength of multiple scattering is characterized by the transport coefficient @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the gluon mean free path ) , which is related to the elastic scattering cross section @xmath70 ( [ sigt ] ) . in our simulations",
    "this strength in fact is regulated mainly by the initial temperature @xmath88 .",
    "then the energy spectrum of coherent medium - induced gluon radiation and the corresponding dominated part of the radiative energy loss has the form  @xcite : @xmath89   \\>\\ln{\\left| \\cos{(\\omega_1\\tau_1 ) } \\right| }   \\",
    "\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{i \\left ( 1 - y + \\frac{c_r}{3}y^2 \\right )     \\bar{\\kappa}\\ln{\\frac{16}{\\bar{\\kappa } } } } \\quad \\mbox{with}\\quad   \\bar{\\kappa } = \\frac{\\mu_d^2\\lambda_g   } { \\omega(1-y ) } ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the fraction of the hard parton energy carried by the radiated gluon , and @xmath92 is the quark color factor . a similar expression for the gluon jet can be obtained by substituting @xmath93 and a proper change of the factor in the square bracket in ( [ radiat ] ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite . the integral ( [ radiat ] ) is carried out over all energies from @xmath94 , the minimal radiated gluon energy in the coherent lpm regime , up to initial jet energy @xmath63 .",
    "the medium was treated as a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , and partons as being produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath95  @xcite . in order to simplify numerical calculations ( and not to introduce new parameters )",
    "we omit the transverse expansion and viscosity of the fluid using the well - known scaling solution due to bjorken  @xcite for a temperature and density of qgp at @xmath96 mev : @xmath97 let us remark that the influence of the transverse flow , as well as of the mixed phase at @xmath98 , on the intensity of jet rescattering ( which is a strongly increasing function of @xmath61 ) seems to be inessential for high initial temperatures @xmath99  @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the presence of viscosity slows down the cooling rate , which leads to a jet parton spending more time in the hottest regions of the medium . as a result",
    "the rescattering intensity goes up , i.e. , in fact the effective temperature of the medium is increased as compared with the perfect qgp  @xcite .",
    "we also do not take into account here the probability of jet rescattering in nuclear matter , because the intensity of this process and the corresponding contribution to the total energy loss are negligible due to the much smaller energy density in `` cold '' nuclei .",
    "for certainty we used the initial conditions for the gluon - dominated plasma formation expected for central pb@xmath9pb collisions at lhc  @xcite : @xmath100 .",
    "for non - central collisions we suggest proportionality of the initial energy density @xmath101 to the ratio of the nuclear overlap function and the effective transverse area of nuclear overlapping  @xcite .    in each event the distribution of jet production vertex at the given impact parameter @xmath26 of @xmath102 collision is generated according to the distribution  @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the distances between the nucleus centers and the jet production vertex @xmath105 ; @xmath106 is the maximum possible transverse distance @xmath107 from the nuclear collision axis to the @xmath108 ; @xmath109 is the radius of the nucleus @xmath110 ; @xmath111 is the nuclear thickness function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed nuclear geometry explanations ) . after that , in every @xmath112th scattering of the co - moving particle ( with the same longitudinal rapidity ) a fast parton loses energy in the collisions and radiatively , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are simulated according to eqs .",
    "( [ col ] ) and ( [ radiat ] ) respectively .",
    "thus in each event the energy of an initial parton decreases by the value @xmath116 .    in the frame of this model and using above qgp parameters we evaluate the mean energy loss of quark of @xmath117 gev in minimum - bias pb@xmath9pb collisions , @xmath118 gev .",
    "in order to analyze the sensitivity of dimuon - jet correlations to the absolute value of partonic energy loss , we also performed the same calculations for the reduced initial temperature , @xmath119 gev , which results in decreasing average energy loss by a factor @xmath120 .",
    "the distribution over a difference between @xmath121 , transverse momentum of @xmath46 pair , and @xmath122 , observed transverse energy of jet , depends crucially on a fraction of the partonic energy loss falling _ outside _ the jet cone .",
    "there are some discussions on the angular spectrum of in - medium radiated gluons in the literature  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since coherent landau - pomeranchuk - migdal radiation induces a strong dependence of the radiative energy loss of a jet on the angular cone size , it will soften particle energy distributions inside the jet , increase the multiplicity of secondary particles , and to a lesser degree , affects the total jet energy .",
    "on the other hand , the energy loss in the collisions turns out to be practically independent of the jet cone size and causes the loss of the total jet energy , because the bulk of the `` thermal '' particles knocked out of the dense matter by the elastic scatterings flies away in on almost transverse direction relatively to the jet axis  @xcite .",
    "thus , although the radiative energy loss of an energetic parton dominates over the loss in the collisions by up to an order of magnitude , the relative contribution of the latter jet energy loss grows with increasing the jet cone size due to the essentially different angular structure of loss for two mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the total energy loss of a jet will be sensitive to the experimental capabilities to detect low - p@xmath6 particles  products of soft gluon fragmentation : thresholds for a giving signal in calorimeters , influence of the strong magnetic field , etc .",
    "@xcite .    since the full treatment of the angular spectrum of emitted gluons is rather sophisticated and model - dependent  @xcite , we considered two simple parameterizations of the distribution of in - medium radiated gluons over the emission angle @xmath123 .",
    "the `` small - angular '' radiation spectrum was parameterized in the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the typical angle of the coherent gluon radiation estimated in  @xcite .",
    "the `` broad - angular '' spectrum has the form @xmath126 we believe that such a simplified treatment here is enough to demonstrate the sensitivity of @xmath7-imbalance in @xmath46+jet production to the medium - induced partonic energy loss .",
    "to be specific , the jet energy is defined here as the total transverse energy of the final particles collected around the direction of a leading particle inside the cone @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle respectively .",
    "fig.2 shows the distribution over @xmath130 for the cases without and with medium - induced energy loss obtained in the framework of our model in minimum - bias pb@xmath9pb collisions , two parameterizations of distribution on gluon emission angles ( [ sar ] ) and ( [ war ] ) being used .",
    "the same geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts as in sect.2 were applied : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 gev/@xmath22 , @xmath134 gev .",
    "although @xmath130-distribution is already smeared in @xmath16 case , mainly due to the initial state gluon radiation , the mean value @xmath135 , as well as the maximum of the distribution are close to @xmath136 . the partonic energy loss in heavy ion collisions results in the visible asymmetry of this distribution , its smearing and shifting mean and maximum values .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for the `` broad - angular '' radiation , because the contribution of the `` out - of - cone '' partonic energy loss is larger as compared with the `` small - angular '' radiation case .",
    "it is important to note that the contribution to jet - dimuon @xmath3-imbalance from collisional part ( always `` out - of - cone '' ) is rather dominant over the contributions from `` broad - angular '' and `` small - angular '' radiation .",
    "the latter ( dash - dotted histrogram ) does not disappear totally just due to the fact that not only leading ( parent ) parton , but all partons of a jet pass through the dense medium and emit gluons under the angles @xmath123 relatively to their proper directions , which in general may not coincide with the jet axis ( determined by the direction of a leading particle ) and sometimes be even at the jet periphery .",
    "thus dimuon - jet correlation will be affected strongly by the collisional part of the loss .    in the real experimental situation",
    "the jet observables will be sensitive to the accuracy of jet energy reconstruction in a high multiplicity environment .",
    "there are the two terms determining this accuracy : systematic jet energy loss and jet energy resolution ( due to calorimeter and jet finder peculiarities , influence of magnetic field , etc . ) .",
    "short measure of jet energy will be well - controlled systematic error which has the similar values for heavy ion and for @xmath16 collisions , and it can be taken into account using the standard calibration procedure  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the finite jet energy resolution will result in additional smearing @xmath130-distribution without shifting mean and maximum values . in order to illustrate the sensitivity of such observables to experimental jet energy resolution @xmath137 , we set for definiteness the simple parameterization , @xmath138 gev , which is close to one obtained with window - type jet finding algorithm for central pb - pb collisions ( with background generated by fast mc code hydro  @xcite for multpilicity @xmath139 ) at cms  @xcite .",
    "fig.3 shows the same distribution as fig.2 , but final jet energy was smeared in each event by value @xmath137 . due to additional",
    "smearing the initial distribution , the effect of jet quenching on shifting mean and maximum values becomes less visible and rather marginal for moderate partonic energy loss .",
    "since jet observables are affected by a number of theoretical ( in particular , sensitivity to the angular spectrum of medium - induced radiation and to the collisional part of energy loss ) and methodical ( finite jet energy resolution ) uncertainties , complementary leading particle measurements are potentially important , such as @xmath7-imbalance between muon pair and a leading particle in a jet .",
    "fig.4 presents the distribution over variable @xmath140 ( under the same conditions as for fig.2 ) , where @xmath141 is the transverse energy of a leading particle ( i.e. particle with maximum @xmath142 ) in a jet .",
    "the choice of a factor of @xmath143 denotes only the fact that the most probable value of a fraction of jet energy carried by leading particles is @xmath144 in our case .",
    "this distribution is originally more smeared and asymmetric than the distribution over @xmath130 . however additional",
    "smearing and shifting mean and maximum values due to partonic energy loss can be also clearly seen even for relatively small loss , @xmath145 gev at @xmath146 gev .",
    "moreover , the observed @xmath7-imbalance between @xmath46 pair and a leading particle in a jet is directly related to the absolute value of partonic energy loss and almost insensitive to the form of the angular spectrum of emitted gluons and collisional loss .",
    "the small difference for various angular distributions is just due to the moderate distinction of event samples which were triggered by having a jet with @xmath45 gev . since fixing",
    "the minimum threshold for jet detection is sensitive to the total jet energy ( and consequently to the angular dependence of energy loss ) , the small influence of the latter on dimuon - leader correlation appears .",
    "we also become convinced that taking into account the jet energy smearing @xmath137 almost does not have influence on dimuon - leader correlation ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the channel with dimuon tagged jet production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions was analyzed .",
    "the cross section of this process and corresponding event rates at lhc energies were evaluated with comphep monte - carlo generator taking into account full @xmath0 interference pattern .",
    "the reasonable statistics , @xmath1 events per 1 month of lhc run with lead beams , can be expected for realistic geometrical acceptance and kinematic cuts .",
    "the correlations between @xmath46 pair and jet , as well as between @xmath46 pair and a leading particle in a jet , were first numerically studied for heavy ion collisions .",
    "the medium - induced partonic energy loss can result in significant smearing the distribution on difference between the transverse momentum of @xmath46 pair and the jet transverse energy , and shifting mean and maximum values of the distribution .",
    "this effect will be sensitive to the fraction of partonic energy loss ( dependent on the form of the angular spectrum of in - medium radiated gluons ) falling outside the jet cone .",
    "however the finite experimental jet energy resolution can result in additional smearing dimuon - jet correlation , which can make difficult observation of @xmath3-imbalance especially for moderate partonic energy loss .",
    "since jet observables are affected by a number of theoretical and methodical uncertainties , complementary leading particle measurements will be useful and even preferable .",
    "@xmath3-imbalance between @xmath46 pair and a leading particle in a jet is quite visible even for moderate loss , directly related to the absolute value of partonic energy loss , almost insensitive to the angular spectrum of emitted gluons and to experimental jet energy resolution .",
    "finally , the study of @xmath2+jet and @xmath2-leading - particle correlations is important for extracting the information about medium - induced partonic energy loss and properties of super - dense qcd matter to be created in heavy ion collisions at the lhc .",
