    "<S> @xmath113 , for the dipole moment @xmath114 d one has @xmath115 nm and @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath2 can be made such @xcite that @xmath117 and one may cover the whole range of parameters in the phase diagram of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ negaphase ] . finally , our results have implications for magnetic atoms such as erbium or dysprosium , which are necessarily dilute due to their small @xmath118 </S>",
