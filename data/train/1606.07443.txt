    "lyman-@xmath15 emitting galaxies ( laes ) are central to a wide range of subjects in extragalactic astronomy .",

    "* and references therein ) , tracers of large scale structure @xcite , signposts for low metallicity stellar populations ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , markers of the galaxy formation process at high redshift @xcite and tracers of active star formation .    in most of those cases , capitalizing the observations requires understanding how laes are formed within an explicit cosmological context . under the current structure formation paradigm , the dominant matter content of the universe is dark matter ( dm ) . each galaxy",
    "is thought to be hosted by a larger dark matter structure known as a halo .",
    "understanding the cosmological context of laes thus implies studying the galaxy - halo connection .",
    "galaxy formation models suggest that the physical processes that regulate the star formation cycle are dependent on halo mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the mass becomes the most important element in the halo - galaxy connection .",
    "the goal becomes finding the typical dm halo mass of halos hosting laes . in the case of laes",
    "there are different ways to find this mass range .",
    "one approach is theoretical , using general astrophysical principles to find the relationship between halo mass , intrinsic  luminosities and observed  luminosities .",
    "this approach is usually implemented through semi - analytic models @xcite and full n - body hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "the downside of these calculations is the uncertainty in the estimation of the escape fraction of  photons .",
    "given the resonant nature of the  line , the escape fraction is sensitive to the dust contents , density , temperature , topology and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the process of finding a consensus on the expected value for the  escape fraction in high redshift galaxies is still matter of open debate @xcite .",
    "a different approach to infer the typical mass of halos hosting laes is based on the spatial clustering information .",
    "this approach uses the fact that in cdm cosmologies the spatial clustering of galaxies on large scales is entirely dictated by the halo distribution @xcite , which in turn has a strong dependence on halo mass . using measurements of the angular correlation function of laes ,",
    "observers have put constraints on the typical mass and occupation fraction of the putative halos hosting these galaxies @xcite . in these studies",
    "the observations are done on fields of @xmath14 deg@xmath13 and the conclusions derived on the halo host mass do not elaborate deeply on the uncertainty resulting from the cosmic variance on these fields .",
    "for instance , @xcite attempted to analytically estimate the uncertainty from cosmic variance following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their prescription assumed that the correlation function can be represented by a power - law @xmath16 .",
    "their estimation of cosmic variance strongly depends on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , @xmath18 is only poorly constrained with current observations which in turns indicates that their cosmic variance estimation could not be precise .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the impact of cosmic variance in constraining the mass and occupation fraction of halos hosting laes at @xmath19 .",
    "we build mock surveys from a cosmological n - body simulation to compare them against the observations of @xcite using the angular correlation function .",
    "we use a simple model to populate a halo in the simulation with a lae assuming a minimum , , and maximum mass , , for the dark matter halos hosting laes .",
    "we do not assume an underlying relation between the   luminosity and the dark matter halo mass .",
    "this approach bypasses all the physical uncertainties associated to star formation and radiative transfer .",
    "we then use the markov chain monte carlo technique to obtain the likelihood of the parameters given the observational constraints .",
    "this approach allows us to estimate cosmic variance directly from simulations without making any assumption on the correlation function behavior .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath20cdm cosmology with the following values for the cosmological parameters , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , corresponding to the matter density , vacuum density and the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 .",
