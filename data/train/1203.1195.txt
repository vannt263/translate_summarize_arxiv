    "the first - order duffin - kemmer - petiau ( dkp ) equation @xcite-@xcite is often seen as an alternative and rather unusual form for describing spin-0 and spin-1 particles .",
    "although the second - order and the dkp formalisms are equivalent in the case of minimally coupled vector interactions @xcite-@xcite , the last formalism opens news horizons as far as it allows the inclusion of other kinds of couplings in a straightforward way @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the nonminimal vector interaction , for instance , refers to a kind of charge - conjugate invariant coupling which behaves like a vector under a lorentz transformation .",
    "the invariance of the nonminimal vector potential under charge conjugation means that it does not couple to the charge of the boson and so it does not distinguish particles from antiparticles . hence , whether one considers spin-0 or spin-1 bosons , this sort of interaction can not exhibit klein s paradox @xcite .",
    "nonminimal vector interactions , added by other kinds of lorentz structures , have already been used successfully in a phenomenological context for describing the scattering of mesons by nuclei @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nonminimal vector couplings with diverse functional forms for the potential functions have been explored in the literature @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    in the present work",
    "some aspects of the stationary states of spin-0 bosons in a double - step potential with a nonminimal vector coupling are analyzed .",
    "scattering states are analyzed and an oscillatory transmission coefficient is found .",
    "an interesting point is that the transmission coefficient never vanishes , regardless the size of the potential barrier . in sharp contrast with a nonrelativistic scheme , the transmission amplitude exhibits complex poles corresponding to bound - state solutions for a potential of sufficient intensity .",
    "the eigenenergies for bound states are solutions of transcendental equations classified as eigenvalues of the parity operator .",
    "those intriguing results are interpreted in terms of solutions of an effective schrdinger equation for a finite square well with additional @xmath0-functions situated at the borders .",
    "the case of a sign potential ( interpreted as a shifted @xmath1-function potential ) with its unique bound - state solution is analyzed as a limiting case of the double - step potential .",
    "the dkp equation for a free boson is given by @xcite ( with units in which @xmath2)@xmath3where the matrices @xmath4  satisfy the algebra @xmath5 and the metric tensor is @xmath6diag@xmath7 . that algebra generates a set of 126 independent matrices whose irreducible representations are a trivial representation , a five - dimensional representation describing the spin-0 particles and a ten - dimensional representation associated to spin-1 particles .",
    "the second - order klein - gordon and proca equations are obtained when one selects the spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the dkp theory .",
    "a well - known conserved four - current is given by @xmath8@xmath9 where the adjoint spinor @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the time component of this current is not positive definite but it may be interpreted as a charge density . then the normalization condition @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath14 , where the plus ( minus ) sign must be used for a positive ( negative ) charge .    with the introduction of nonminimal vector interactions , the dkp equation can be written as @xcite@xmath15a_{\\mu } \\right ) \\psi = 0   \\label{dkp2}\\]]where @xmath16 is a projection operator ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) in such a way that @xmath19\\psi $ ] behaves like a vector under a lorentz transformation as does @xmath20 .",
    "once again @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if the potential is time - independent one can write @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the energy of the boson , in such a way that the time - independent dkp equation becomes@xmath24a_{\\mu } \\right ) \\right ] \\phi = 0   \\label{dkp10}\\]]for the case of spin 0 , we use the representation for the @xmath4matrices given by @xcite@xmath25where@xmath26@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are 2@xmath303 , 2@xmath302 and 3@xmath303 zero matrices , respectively , while the superscript t designates matrix transposition . here",
    "the projection operator can be written as @xcite @xmath31 . in this case",
    "@xmath16 picks out the first component of the dkp spinor .",
    "the five - component spinor can be written as @xmath32 in such a way that the time - independent dkp equation for a boson constrained to move along the @xmath33-axis , restricting ourselves to potentials depending only on @xmath34 , decomposes into@xmath35@xmath36@xmath37meanwhile , @xmath38given that the interaction potentials satisfy certain conditions , we have a well - defined sturm - liouville problem for determining the possible discrete or continuous eigenvalues of the system .",
    "we also note that there is only one independent component  of the dkp spinor for the spin-0 sector .",
    "it is not hard to see that the spectrum is symmetrical about @xmath39 , as it should be since @xmath40 does not distinguish particles from antiparticles .",
    "note also that for ensuring the covariance of the dkp theory under the parity operation one must have @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that the parity of @xmath43 is opposite to that one of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in such a way that the dkp spinor has a definite parity .",
    "furthermore , the change @xmath46 drastically changes the spectrum .",
    "let us focus our attention on the space component of a nonminimal potential with @xmath47 .",
    "we consider the double - step potential @xmath48    \\label{sc1a}\\]]with @xmath49 and @xmath50 defined to be real numbers ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 is the heaviside step function .",
    "it is of interest to note that in the limit @xmath53 , the double - step function reduces to @xmath54@xmath55 , where @xmath56@xmath57 .",
    "our problem is to solve ( [ dkp4 ] ) for @xmath44 and to determine the allowed energies . in this case the first line of ( [ dkp4 ] ) can be written as@xmath58 \\right.\\]]@xmath59 \\right\\ } \\phi _ { 1}=0   \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath60 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we turn our attention to scattering states so that the solutions describing spinless bosons coming from the left can be written as @xmath61where@xmath62then , @xmath44 describes an incident wave moving to the right ( @xmath63 is a real number ) and a reflected wave moving to the left with@xmath64and a transmitted wave moving to the right with@xmath65we demand that @xmath44 be continuous at @xmath66 , i. e.@xmath67otherwise , ( [ eq1 ] ) would contain the derivative of a @xmath1-function .",
    "effects due to the potential on @xmath68 in the neighbourhood of @xmath69 can be evaluated by integrating ( [ eq1 ] ) from @xmath70 to @xmath71 and taking the limit @xmath72 .",
    "the connection formula between @xmath68 at the right and @xmath73 at the left can be summarized as@xmath74with @xmath44 given by ( [ eq50 ] ) , conditions ( [ cont ] ) and ( discont ) imply that @xmath75omitting the algebraic details , we state the solution for the relative amplitudes@xmath76where we have defined@xmath77    in order to determinate the reflection and transmission coefficients we use the charge current densities @xmath78 and @xmath79 . the @xmath34-independent current density allow us to define the reflection and transmission coefficients as@xmath80with @xmath81 . the last relative amplitude in ( [ amp ] ) allow us to write the transmission coefficient as@xmath82 ^{-1}\\]]regardless of the sign of @xmath83 . notice that @xmath84 as @xmath85 and that there is a resonance transmission ( @xmath86 ) whenever @xmath87 with @xmath88    the possibility of bound states requires a solution given by ( [ eq50 ] ) with @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 in order to obtain a square - integrable @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , if one considers the transmission amplitude as a function of the complex variable @xmath92 one sees that for @xmath92 real and positive one obtains the scattering states whereas the bound states would be obtained by the poles lying along the positive imaginary axis of the complex @xmath92-plane . setting @xmath93 and expanding @xmath94 in a power series in @xmath95 about @xmath96",
    ", we obtain@xmath97where @xmath98 denotes higher - order terms .",
    "thus , @xmath96 is a pole only for @xmath99 .",
    "the other poles are solutions of the transcendental equation@xmath100with the amplitudes given by ( [ amp ] ) one obtains the ratios @xmath101so that one can write @xmath102for @xmath89 .",
    "it is true that the first line of ( [ amp ] ) furnishes @xmath103 .",
    "it has to be so since the charge current density @xmath104 vanishes in the region @xmath105 whereas in the region @xmath106 it takes the form@xmath107hence , one concludes that bound states are only possible if @xmath96 or @xmath108 is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath34 , it follows that @xmath109 can be either even or odd .",
    "hence , @xmath110so that@xmath111for @xmath112 , and@xmath113for @xmath114 .",
    "the condition @xmath115 demands@xmath116using the identity @xmath117 , one can write this last relation as@xmath118with the proviso that the root @xmath96 is valid only for @xmath119 ( from ( [ amp ] ) one sees that @xmath120 for @xmath96 ) .",
    "in addition , by virtue of the identity @xmath121 , one may readily check that ( [ bs ] ) implies into@xmath122now we see that @xmath123@xmath124 is the parity eigenvalue and that @xmath96 furnishes a legitimate even bound - state solution for @xmath99 ( whatever the intensity of @xmath125 , the solution @xmath96 makes @xmath126 independent of @xmath34 for latexmath:[$%    @xmath96 , the equation for even - parity solutions is mapped into that one for odd - parity solutions under the change of  @xmath83  by @xmath128 , and vice versa . in addition , because @xmath129 , ( [ bs ] ) can also be written as@xmath130based on @xmath131 , equation ( [ bs ] ) is transformed into@xmath132for @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . equation ( [ b2 ] ) is the quantization condition corresponding to @xmath135 .",
    "the solutions of these transcendental equations are to be found from numerical or graphical methods .    tackling ( [ b2 ] ) first",
    ", one sees that except for @xmath96 for @xmath136 and even @xmath44 , or @xmath137 and odd @xmath138 , the left - hand side of ( [ b2 ] ) is always negative whereas its right - hand side is always positive .",
    "therefore , equations ( [ b2 ] ) furnish no solutions , except @xmath96 for even@xmath44 with @xmath136 .",
    "the graphical method for @xmath139@xmath140 is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the solutions for bound states are given by the intersection of the curve represented by @xmath141 with the curves represented by @xmath142 for @xmath119 , it needs critical values , corresponding to @xmath143 , for obtaining bound states .",
    "if @xmath83 is larger than the critical values there will be a finite sequence of bound states with alternating parities .",
    "the ground - state solution will correspond to an even solution . as commented",
    "before , the odd - parity solution with @xmath119 is spurious .",
    "when @xmath125 approaches infinity the intersections will occur at the asymptotes of @xmath141 ( except for @xmath96 ) so that the solutions will be given by @xmath144then , if @xmath145there will be @xmath146 bound states , except for @xmath96 for @xmath136 , with eigenvalues given by @xmath147    finally , in the limit @xmath53 ( @xmath148 ) one has@xmath149and the transmission amplitude has one and only one pole ( at @xmath150 for @xmath151 ) corresponding to an even bound - state solution with @xmath152",
    "the stationary states of spinless bosons interacting via nonminimal vector coupling was investigated by a technique which maps the dkp equation into a sturm - liouville problem for the first component of the dkp spinor . scattering states in a double - step potential were analyzed and an oscillatory transmission coefficient was found .",
    "an interesting feature of the scattering is that the transmission coefficient never vanishes , no matter how large @xmath49 may be .",
    "it was shown that , for a potential of sufficient intensity , the transmission amplitude exhibits complex poles corresponding to bound - state solutions .",
    "the eigenenergies for bound states are solutions of transcendental equations classified as eigenvalues of the parity operator .",
    "the case of a sign potential was analyzed by a limiting process . in that last case we obtained a non - oscillatory transmission coefficient and a unique bound state . as the potential is a double step , or a sign potential in a limiting case",
    ", one should not expect the existence of bound states , and it follows that such bound states are consequence of the peculiar coupling in the dkp equation .    for a better understanding of  those unexpected results , it can be observed that the first line of ( [ dkp4 ] ) can also be written as @xmath153 \\phi _ { 1}\\,=e_{\\mathtt{eff}}\\phi _ { 1 }   \\label{heff}\\]]with@xmath154the set ( [ heff])-([sc2 ] ) plus @xmath155 correspond to the nonrelativistic description of a particle of mass @xmath156 with energy @xmath157 subject to a potential @xmath158 . as the effective potential has a more complicated structure , with quadratic plus derivative terms , the success of the strategy of this mapping depends crucially of the choice for the potential @xmath159 .",
