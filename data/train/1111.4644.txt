    "seeking tractable solutions of nonlinear evolution equations has been the focus of intense study for the past several decades ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "while many strategies have been employed , such as the hirota bilinear method @xcite , homogeneous balance method @xcite , trigonometric method @xcite , the hyperbolic method @xcite , the jacobi elliptic function method @xcite and iterative method @xcite to name a few , perturbative techniques have also been used to extract multi - order exact periodic solutions based on lam@xmath1 equation and jacobi elliptic functions @xcite . in this note",
    "we propose a generalized class of lam@xmath1 equation comprising an auxiliary function @xmath2 to consider correlations between it and the perurbatively reduced nonlinear evolution equation for different orders of the perturbative parameter .",
    "a generalized lam@xmath1 equation is expressed as @xmath3y=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 stands for an eigenvalue , @xmath5 is a positive integer and we restrict the auxiliary function @xmath2 to obey an elliptic equation @xmath6 in ( [ proposedode ] ) and ( [ elip ] ) , @xmath7 are real constants .",
    "it is well known that equation ( [ elip ] ) admits of several categories of solutions for different values of @xmath7 all expressible in terms of modulus @xmath8 of the jacobi elliptic functions . for later use",
    "we summarize a few relevant ones in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "we have selected a physically meaningful model of a generalized shallow water wave equation @xcite which is amenable to a perturbative treatment by looking for a travelling wave variable @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave number and @xmath16 is the wave speed .",
    "we discuss the procedure of obtaining the solutions in the next section . in the following section we also take up applicability of our scheme to other nonlinear evolution equations namely , the korteweg de vries ( kdv ) equation , modified kdv equation , boussinesq equation , klein - gordon equation and modified benjamin - bona - mahony ( mbbm ) equation with a view to tracking down new hitherto unexplored multi - order solutions .",
    "the main point of our analysis is to demonstrate that all such solutions can be written down in a generic form in terms of the function @xmath0 .    to make equation ( [ proposedode ] ) accessible in terms of known lam@xmath1 functions",

    "we turn attention to a generalized class of shallow water wave ( gsww ) equation given by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 under boussinesq approximation the derivation of ( [ gsww ] ) results from the classical study of water waves .",
    "more interestingly , there also follows various classical and non - classical reductions from gsww such as the kdv and bbm equations .",

    "for the travelling wave solutions @xmath36 , equation ( [ gsww ] ) can be reduced in terms of the variable @xmath37 to the ode form @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is an integrating constant .",
    "to tackle ( [ rgsww ] ) perturbatively we set @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a small parameter and @xmath44 represent various multi - order solutions like the zeroth - order , first - order , second - order solutions etc . of equation ( [ rgsww ] ) .",
    "accordingly we can write @xmath45 as @xmath46 where @xmath47    substituting the series ( [ pert ] ) in equation ( [ rgsww ] ) we obtain for each power of @xmath48 the corresponding equations @xmath49 and so on .",
