    "the release of the first results @xcite from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) constituted a major milestone in cosmology , laying a solid foundation upon which to found the cosmological quest in coming years .",
    "although much of the attention in the wake of the wmap release has focused on `` sexy '' issues like the power spectrum and its cosmological implications , the primary stated science goal of wmap is to produce maps . indeed ,",
    "one of the qualitatively new types of research made possible by wmap involves taking advantage of this spatial information by cross - correlating the maps with other cosmological templates such as galaxy @xcite , x - ray @xcite , infrared and lensing maps @xcite , which can reveal interesting signals ranging from the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect to the sz effect and lensing @xcite .",
    "many such future studies will be looking for signals of modest statistical significance , so it is important to quantify and minimize unwanted signals in the map due to foreground contamination and detector noise . accurately understanding the foreground signal is also important for the interpretation of the wmap early reionization detection @xcite and for the interpretation of the low wmap quadrupole @xcite , since galactic foregrounds are most important on large angular scales @xcite .",
    "the wmap team has already performed a careful foreground analysis @xcite combining the five frequency bands into a single foreground - cleaned map , shown in figure 1 ( top ) . given the huge effort that has gone into creating the spectacular multifrequency maps",
    ", it is clearly worthwhile to subject them to an independent foreground analysis .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper , which we will argue not only corroborates the findings of the wmap team , but also makes some further improvements that we believe are useful .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to remove foregrounds , not to understand or model them . for reviews of foreground modeling issues ,",
    "see , , @xcite and references therein .",
    "there is a rich literature of techniques for foreground removal .",
    "the work most closely related to the present paper is that done in preparation for the planck mission @xcite , developing multipole - based cleaning techniques and testing them on simulations .",
    "= 15.1 cm    -26.05 cm    = 14.7 cm    -7.42 cm    = 14.7 cm",
    "-7.42 cm    = 14.7 cm    -3 cm    = 17.5 cm",
    "a key goal of the cmb community is to measure the function @xmath4 , the true cmb sky temperature in the sky direction given by the unit vector @xmath5 .",
    "the wmap team have observed the sky in five frequency bands denoted k , ka , q , v and w , centered on the frequencies of 22.8 , 33.0 , 40.7 , 60.8 and 93.5 ghz , respectively , producing five corresponding maps ( figure 2 , left ) that we will refer to as @xmath6 , @xmath7 . in practice , each of these maps are discretized into @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 healpix pixels @xcite , so @xmath6 is an @xmath11-dimensional vector .",
    "however , since the maps are more than adequately oversampled relative to the beam resolution , it is equivalent and often simpler to think of them simply as five smooth functions @xmath12 .",
    "conversely , we will occasionally write the true sky as a pixelized vector @xmath13 .",
    "these maps are related to the true sky @xmath13 by the affine relation _",
    "i = _ i+_i , where the matrix @xmath14 encodes the effect of beam smoothing and the additive term @xmath15 is the contribution from detector noise and foreground contamination , collectively referred to as `` junk '' below since it complicates the recovery of @xmath13 . defining the larger matrices and vectors (       let us close by returning from small to large angular scales .",
    "the surprisingly small cmb quadrupole has intrigued the cosmology community ever since if was first observed by cobe / dmr @xcite , and simulations by @xcite show that the low value observed by wmap is sufficiently unlikely to warrant serious concern .",
    "the wmap team measured the quadrupole using only the part of the sky outside of their galactic cut , and stress that the dominant uncertainty in its value is foreground modeling .",
    "while we agree with this assessment , it should be borne in mind that noise variance and beam issues are completely negligible on these huge angular scales , so this does not imply that the foreground uncertainties are large compared to the signal itself . indeed",
    ", suggests that foregrounds are subdominant to the intrinsic cmb signal even _ without any galaxy cut _ if a foreground - cleaned map is used . while the reader may feel disturbed by the clearly visible galactic residuals in figure 1 ( in both the top and bottom maps ) ,",
    "it is important to bear in mind that these signals are present in only a tiny fraction of the total sky area and therefore contribute little to the total power spectrum .    to quantify the impact of the galactic plane , we computed a sequence of all - sky power spectra for both our map and the ilc map .",
    "we first used the unadulterated maps , then repeated the calculation after repacing the dirtiest of the nine regions from with zeroes , then zeroed our the 2nd dirtiest region as well , this zeroing procedure obviously biases the measurements by removing power , by an amount related to the zeroed area , but provides a powerful test of how sensitive the results are to galactic plane details .",
    "we also band - pass filtered the resulting maps to produce spatial plots of the quadrupole , octopole and hexadacapole .",
    "we found that zeroing out the dirtiest parts of the galactic plane had a negligible effect on both the power spectrum and on the spatial structure of these lowest multipoles .",
    "specifically , we could zero out all but the three cleanest regions ( everything with @xmath16mk ) without the quadrupole or octopole changing substantially .",
    "the spatial morphology of the quadrupole , octopole and hexadecapole for the all - sky analysis agrees well between our map and the ilc map , again showing insensitivity to galaxy modeling details ( in particular , the ilc map is likely to have less contamination in the galactic plane due to more subdivisions there ) .",
    "although more detailed foreground modeling would be needed to rigorously quantify the foreground contribution to low multipoles , let us , encouraged by the above - mentioned tests , tentatively assume that this contribution is unimportant and perform an all - sky analysis of our cleaned map .",
    "the resulting power spectrum is shown in , which is simply a blow - up of the leftmost part of the previous figure , and the corresponding angular correlation function is shown in .",
    "table 1 summarizes the quadrupole and octopole results .",
    "we see that although the quadrupole is still low , it is not quite as low as that from the cut - sky wmap team analysis of @xcite .",
    "moreover , our map has a quadrupole virtually identical to the wmap team ilc map despite the differences in foreground modeling , further supporting our hypothesis that the quadrupole is not strongly affected by foregrounds .",
    "the second column in table 1 shows the probability of the quadrupole in our hubble volume being as low as observed if the best - fit wmap team model from @xcite is correct .",
    "this is computed for the all - sky case where @xmath17 has a @xmath18-distribution with 5 degrees of freedom , so the probability tabulated is simply @xmath19/\\gamma(5/2)$ ] , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the incomplete and complete gamma functions , respectively using markov chains . ] .",
    "we see that the statistical significance of the low quadrupole problem drops substantially with our all - sky analysis , below the 95% significance level , requiring merely a one - in - twenty fluke .    to understand why the all - sky quadrupole is larger than the cut - sky one measured by the wmap team",
    ", we plot the lowest three multipoles of our cleaned map in , all on the same temperature scale .",
    "several features are noteworthy .",
    "first of all , the quadrupole is low with an interesting alignment .",
    "a generic quadrupole has three orthogonal pairs of extrema ( two maxima , two minima and two saddle points ) .",
    "we see that the actual cmb quadrupole has its strongest pair of lobes , apparently coincidentally , fall near the galactic plane .",
    "applying a galaxy cut therefore removes a substantial fraction of the quadrupole power .",
    "the saddle point is seen to be close to zero . in other words",
    ", there is a preferred axis in space along which the observed quadrupole has almost no power .",
    "second , the observed quadrupole is the sum of the cosmic quadrupole and the dynamic quadrupole due to our motion relative to the cmb rest frame - see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "since this motion is accurately known from the cmb dipole measurement @xcite , the dynamic quadrupole can and should be subtracted when studying the cosmic contribution . shows the dynamic quadrupole approximated by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 towards @xmath24 is the velocity of the solar system relative to the cmb @xcite and @xmath25 is the angle relative to this velocity vector .",
    "this is a small correction with peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath26 , and table 1 shows that it reduces the cosmic quadrupole slightly .",
    "this approximation is crude since the dynamic quadrupole in fact depends on frequency @xcite , and therefore may have been either over- or under - estimated in our foreground cleaned map - we have shown it here merely to illustrate its spatial orientation and give an order - of - magnitude estimate of its importance .",
    "third , although the overall octopole power is large , not suppressed like the quadrupole , it too displays the unusual property of a preferred axis along which power is suppressed .",
    "moreover , this axis is seen to be approximately aligned with that for the quadrupole .",
    "the reason that our measured octopole in is larger than that reported by the wmap team is therefore , once again , that much of the power falls within the galaxy cut .",
    "in contrast , the hexadecapole is seen to exhibit the more generic behavior we expect of an isotropic random field , with no obvious preferred axis .",
    "how significant is this quadrupole - octopole alignment ? as a simple definition of preferred axis for an arbitrary sky map , @xcite computes the unit vector @xmath5 around which the angular momentum dispersion @xmath27 is maximized . here",
    "@xmath28 denotes the spherical harmonic coefficients of the map in a rotated coordinate system with its @xmath29-axis in the the @xmath5-direction .",
    "the preferred axes @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the quadrupole and octopole , respectively , are _ 2&= & ( -0.1145 , -0.5265 , 0.8424 ) , + _ 3&= & ( -0.2578 , -0.4207 , 0.8698 ) , , both roughly in the direction of @xmath1 in virgo .",
    "the angle between these two axes is merely @xmath32 , and the probability that a random axis falls inside a circle of radius @xmath32 around the quadrupole axis is simply the area of this circle over the area of the half - sphere , about @xmath33 . in other words , if the cmb is an isotropic gaussian random field , then a chance alignment this good requires about a 1-in-62 fluke .",
    "this issue is discussed in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "what does this all mean ?",
    "although we have presented these low multipole results merely in an exploratory spirit , and more thorough modeling of the foreground contribution to @xmath34 and @xmath35 is certainly warranted , it is difficult not to be intrigued by the similarities of with what is expected in some non - standard models , for instance ones involving a flat `` small universe '' with a compact topology as in @xcite and one of the three dimensions being relatively small ( of order the horizon size or smaller )",
    ". this could have the effect of suppressing the large - scale power in this particular spatial direction in the same sense as is seen in .",
    "as so often in science when measurements are improved , wmap has answered old questions and raised new ones .",
    "we thank the the wmap team for producing such a superb data set and for promptly making it public via the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
    "support for lambda is provided by the nasa office of space science .",
    "we thank krzysztof grski and collaborators for creating the healpix package @xcite , which we used both for harmonic transforms and map plotting .",
