    "mathematical models for scientific and engineering systems often involve with some uncertainties .",
    "we may roughly classify such uncertainties into two kinds .",
    "the first kind of uncertainties may be called _",
    "model uncertainty_. they involve with physical processes that are less known , not yet well understood , not well - observed or measured , and thus difficult to be represented in the mathematical models .",
    "the second kind of uncertainties may be called _",
    "simulation uncertainty_. this arises in numerical simulations of multiscale systems that display a wide range of spatial and temporal scales , with no clear scale separation . due to the limitations of computer power , at present and for the conceivable future",
    ", not all scales of variability can be explicitly simulated or resolved .",
    "although these unresolved scales may be very small or very fast , their long time impact on the resolved simulation may be delicate ( i.e. , may be negligible or may have significant effects , or in other words , uncertain ) .",
    "thus , to take the effects of unresolved scales on the resolved scales into account , representations or parameterizations of these effects are desirable .    these uncertainties are sometimes also called _ unresolved scales _ , as they are not represented or not resolved in modeling or simulation .",
    "model uncertainties have been considered in , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "works relevant for parameterizing unresolved scales include @xcite , among others .",
    "in this paper we consider an issue of approximating model uncertainty or simulation uncertainty ( unresolved scales ) by stochastic processes , and then devise a stochastic scheme for such approximations .",
    "we first recall some basic facts about fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) in  [ fbm ] .",
    "then we discuss model uncertainty and simulation uncertainty in  [ modelerror ] and  [ sles ] , respectively . finally , we present an example in  [ example ] demonstrating our result .",
    "this example involves approximating subgrid scales via correlated noises , in the context of large eddy simulations of a partial differential equation .",
    "we discuss a model of colored noise in terms of fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) , including a special case which is white noise in terms of usual brownian motion .",
    "the fractional brownian motion @xmath0 , indexed by a so called hurst parameter @xmath1 , is a generalization of the more well - known process of the usual brownian motion @xmath2 .",
    "it is a centered gaussian process with stationary increments .",
    "however , the increments of the fractional brownian motion are not independent , except in the usual brownian motion case ( @xmath3 ) . for more details , see @xcite",
    ". +   + definition of fractional brownian motion : for @xmath4 , a gaussian process @xmath0 , or @xmath5 , is a fractional brownian motion if it starts at zero @xmath6 , has mean zero @xmath7 = 0 $ ] , and has covariance @xmath8 = \\frac12(|t|^{2h } + |s|^{2h } - |t - s|^{2h})$ ] for all t and s. the standard brownian motion is a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath3 . +   + some properties of fractional brownian motion : a fractional brownian motion @xmath9 has the following properties : + ( i ) it has stationary increments ; + ( ii ) when @xmath10 , it has independent increments ; + ( iii ) when @xmath11 , it is neither markovian , nor a semimartingale .",
    "+ we use the weierstrass - mandelbrot function to approximate the fractional brownian motion .",
    "the basic idea is to simulate fractional brownian motion by randomizing a representation due to weierstrass . given the hurst parameter @xmath12 with @xmath13 , we define the function @xmath14 to approximate the fractional brownian motion : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 s are normally distributed random variables with mean @xmath18 and standard deviation @xmath19 , and the @xmath20 s are uniformly distributed random variables in the interval @xmath21 .",
    "the underlying theoretical foundation for this approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show a sample path of the usual brownian motion ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) , and fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath22 , respectively .    _ , width=384,height=288 ]    , with @xmath23_,width=384,height=288 ]",
    "we consider a spatially extended system modeled by a partial differential equation ( pde ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a linear ( unbounded ) differential operator , and @xmath26 is a nonlinear function of @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and satisfies a local lipschitz condition .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 may also depend on the gradient of @xmath30 .",
    "if this ( deterministic ) model is accurate , i.e. , its prediction on the field @xmath30 matches with the observational data @xmath31 on a certain period of time @xmath32 $ ] , then there is no need for a stochastic approach .",
    "however , when the prediction @xmath30 deviates from the observational data @xmath31 , we then need to modify the model . in this case",
    ", the observational data @xmath31 may be thought to satisfy a modified model : @xmath33 where the model uncertainty @xmath34 is usually a fluctuating ( i.e. , random ) process , as the observational data @xmath31 is so ( i.e. , has various samples or realizations ) .    the model discrepancy or model uncertainty",
    "@xmath34 may have various causes , such as missing physical mechanisms ( not represented in the deterministic model ) .",
    "sometimes , the model uncertainty @xmath34 is smaller in magnitude than other terms in the model and thus is often ignored in the deterministic modeling .",
    "however , being small and being fluctuating may not necessarily imply that its impact on the overall system evolution to be small @xcite . to take this impact into account",
    ", we would like to model or approximate @xmath34 by a stochastic process .",
    "we first calculate the model uncertainty @xmath34 via observational data @xmath31 . by discretizing and using data samples for @xmath31 ,",
    "we obtain ( discretized ) samples for @xmath35 .",
    "the time correlation may then be calculated using the samples of @xmath35 .",
    "if the time correlation scale is significantly shorter than the time scale for the field @xmath30 , we may ignore the time correlation and thus approximate @xmath35 by the following stochastic process containing a ( uncorrelated ) white noise , for example : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean of @xmath35 ( computed from data ) , @xmath38 is the usual brownian motion ( reviewed in  [ example ] below ) and the deterministic noise intensity @xmath39 may depend on space . here",
    "@xmath39 may be computed via stochastic calculus , especially the ito isometry , as follows .",

    "this section deals with simulation uncertainty , i.e. , stochastically parameterizing the effects of the unresolved scales on the resolved scales .",
    "we consider this issue in the context of large eddy simulations ( les ) of a nonlinear partial differential equation with memory .",
    "in large eddy simulations of fluid or geophysical fluid flows @xcite , the unresolved scales appear as the so - called subgrid scales ( sgs ) .",
    "the sgs term appears to be highly fluctuating (  random \" ) ; see the figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "partially motivated by this , stochastic parameterizations of subgrid scales have been investigated in fluid , geophysical and climate simulations , based on physical or intuitive or empirical arguments .",
    "another , perhaps more important , motivation for applying stochastic parameterizations of subgrid scales is to induce the desired backward energy flux (  stochastic backscatter \" ) in fluid simulations @xcite .",
    "we present one stochastic parameterization scheme of the subgrid scale term in the large eddy simulation of a nonlinear partial differential equation with an extra memory term , which is in fact a nonlinear integro - partial differential equation .",
    "the approximation scheme is based on stochastic calculus involving with a fractional brownian motion , and the  parameter to be calculated is a spatial function , which is derived using ito stochastic calculus .",
    "@xmath44    where @xmath25 is a linear differential operator , and @xmath35 is a nonlinear function of @xmath27 with @xmath28and @xmath29 , and satisfies a local lipschitz condition .",
    "we investigate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved scales in the context of large eddy simulations of the above system .",
    "the idea of large eddy simulation is to split the flow into a local , spatial mean ( or average ) and a fluctuation about the that mean .",
    "the mean @xmath45 is defined by filtering or mollification ( convolution with an approximate identity ) .",
    "the goal is to predict the mean accurately .",
    "this is widely believed possible based on the idea that since fluctuations have random character , their average effects on the mean notion can successfully be medelled .",
    "to filter the solution , we pick a filter .",
    "many different ones are commonly used . to fix the ideas , in this paper",
    ", we use gaussian filter as in @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the filter size and the filter is such that : ( i ) @xmath48 is infinitely differentiable in space and , ( ii ) @xmath49 as @xmath50 in @xmath51 . here and hereafter @xmath52 or the over bar @xmath45 denotes convolution .",
    "the mean @xmath45 is a weighted average of @xmath30 about the point @xmath53 . as @xmath54 ,",
    "the points near @xmath53 are weighted more and more heavily , so @xmath49 as @xmath54 in @xmath51 .",
    "using the fact that convolution commutes with differentiatian , we get the space - filtered system : @xmath55 or @xmath56 where the subgrid scale term @xmath57 . since generally @xmath58 , the usual parameterization or closure problem of the large eddy simulation has arisen . due to",
    "inaccurate ( uncertain ) initial conditions or boundary conditions , @xmath59 is a correlated fluctuating process @xcite , depending on samples @xmath60 in a suitable sample space @xmath61 .",
    "we thus would like to approximate the subgrid scale term @xmath62 by a stochastic process with a correlated ( i.e. , colored ) noise component , for example : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a colored noise ( generalized time derivative of a fractional brownian motion ; reviewed in ",
    "[ example ] below ) , and @xmath65 is the mean component of the subgrid scale term @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the noise intensity @xmath67 is a non - negative deterministic function to be determined from fluctuating sgs data @xmath68 .",
    "the subgrid scale term @xmath66 may be inferred from observational data ( see @xcite for relevant information for subgrid scales in navier - stokes equations ) , or from fine mesh simulations .    note that @xmath39 is to be calculated or estimated from the fluctuating sgs data @xmath68 , either from observation or from fine mesh simulations .",
    "so this is an inverse problem . as in usual inverse problems",
    "@xcite , the stochastic parameterizations for the sgs term @xmath68 is not unique .",
    "what we proposed above is merely an example .",
    "this offers an opportunity for trying various stochastic parameterization schemes , much as one uses various smoother functions ( e.g. , polynomials or fourier series ) to approximate less regular functions or data in deterministic approximation theory .    to estimate the unknown parameter ( function ) @xmath67 ,",
    "we start with the following relation : @xmath69 taking time integral over a computational interval @xmath32 $ ] on both sides , we obtain @xmath70dt   =   \\int_0^t \\sigma(x )   d{b}^h_t = \\sigma(x ) b^h_t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , taking mean - square on both sides , @xmath71dt)^2 & = & \\sigma^2(x )   t^{2h}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus an estimator for @xmath67 is @xmath72dt)^2 } \\;\\ ; ,    \\label{ax2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be computed numerically .    by the stochastic parameterization ( [ noise2 ] ) on the sgs term @xmath68 , with @xmath73 determined from ( [ force2 ] ) and @xmath74 from ( [ ax2 ] ) , the les model ( [ les2 ] ) becomes a stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) for the large eddy solution @xmath75 : @xmath76 with the appropriately filtered boundary condition and filtered initial condition .",
    "we present a specific example of stochastic modeling of simulation uncertainty of subgrid scales , in the context of large eddy simulations . we consider the following nonlinear partial differential equation with a memory term ( time - integral term ) @xcite : @xmath77 under appropriate initial condition @xmath78 and boundary conditions @xmath79 with @xmath80 constants , on a bounded domain @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is a positive constant .",
    "this model arises in mathematical modeling in ecology @xcite , heat conduction in certain materials @xcite and materials science @xcite . the time - integral term here represents a memory effect depending on the past history of the system state , and this memory effect decays polynomially fast in time .",
    "the large eddy solution @xmath83 is the true solution @xmath30 looked through a filter : i.e. , through convolution with a spatial filter @xmath84 , with spatial scale ( or filter size or cut - off size ) @xmath47 : @xmath85 in this paper , we use a gaussian filter as in @xcite , @xmath86 .      we can write @xmath92 with @xmath45 the large eddy term and @xmath93 the fluctuating term .",
    "note that @xmath94 .",
    "so the sgs term @xmath90 involves nonlinear interactions of fluctuations @xmath93 and the large eddy flows .",
    "thus @xmath90 may be regarded as a function of @xmath45 and @xmath93 : @xmath95 .",
    "the leads to a possibility of approximating @xmath90 by a suitable stochastic process defined on a probability space @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , the sample space , @xmath98field @xmath99 and probability measure @xmath100 .",
    "this means that we treat @xmath68 data as random data as in @xcite , which take different realizations , e.g. , due to fluctuating observations or due to numerical simulation with initial and boundary conditions with small fluctuations . in fluid or geophysical fluid simulations",
    ", the sgs term may be highly fluctuating and time - correlated @xcite , and this term may be inferred from observational data @xcite , or from fine mesh simulations .",
    "this further suggests for parameterizing the subgrid scale term @xmath90 as a time - correlated or colored noisy term .",
    "the increments of fractional brownian motion are correlated in time and hence its generalized time derivative @xmath101 is used as a model for colored noise . in the special case @xmath3 , we have the white noise @xmath102 .",
    "thus we parameterize the subgrid scale term @xmath103 , which is time - correlated , by colored noise @xmath101 as follows : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the mean component of the subgrid scale term @xmath103 .",

    "we represent the mean component @xmath106 in terms of the large eddy solution @xmath45 .",
    "the specific form for @xmath73 depends on the nature of the mean of @xmath68 .",
