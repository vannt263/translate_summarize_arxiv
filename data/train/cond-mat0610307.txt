    "the electronic kinetic energy scale reflects the strength of the correlations @xcite .",
    "its temperature dependence remains unsettled , from a theoretical point of view and from the experiments where the temperature dependence varies from sample to sample @xcite .",
    "such discrepancies suggest that the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath14 ( or of the spectral weight ) is not universal .    in this communication",
    ", we take advantage of our measurements in both n  type pr@xmath1ce@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( pcco ) and p ",
    "type bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( bscco ) thin films . relying on the metallic behavior of the overdoped samples , whether n or p  type",
    ", we note that the underdoped compounds deviate from this metallic behavior at some temperature t@xmath9 .",
    "we argue that such deviations , although quite different in pcco and bscco , are associated with the onset of a `` pseudogap '' .",
    "one caveat though : we use the term `` pseudogap '' for the sake of simplicity , and we mean a density gap",
    ". however it may relate to different physics .",
    "this still vividly debated issue is beyond the scope of this communication .",
    "samples are thin films with thicknesses ranging from 2000 to 3000  ",
    ". details about their preparation and characteristics and about the experimental procedure can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure 1 displays the optical conductivity for two pcco and bscco underdoped samples in a temperature range where pseudogaps were claimed previously to be identified . a clear dip and a maximum at @xmath16  1700  @xmath17 develop in the pcco sample as @xmath15 decreases .",
    "a dip and a maximum at @xmath16  800  @xmath17 are hardly visible at 75  k in the case on underdoped bscco .",
    "if such maxima relate to a density gap feature , then upon the opening of such a gap , states are transferred from the fermi energy to a higher energy .",
    "this reflects as a spectral weight transfer toward high energy at the temperature where the gap opens .",
    "we expect this transfer of spectral weight to be best observed when integrating up to a cut - off frequency @xmath12 ( eq.1 ) of the order of the gap energy .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the change of spectral weight for a set of cut - off frequencies spanning the range @xmath18  @xmath17 in pcco ( fig.2 ) and bscco ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the @xmath12 cut - off frequencies are the same in a single family , but not in - between the two families .",
    "the values were selected in order to display the characteristic energy scales where changes in the temperature dependence are best seen .",
    "we translated the spectral weight in units of a carrier density per copper @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the actual effective carrier density per copper is obtained for @xmath20  @xmath17 .",
    "we find @xmath21 = 0.22 and 0.26 for the overdoped and underdoped pcco respectively , 0.32 and 0.35 for the underdoped and overdoped bscco respectively @xcite .",
    "the difference @xmath22 versus @xmath15 is displayed in fig.2 and 3 .",
    "the scatter of the points at 20000  @xmath17 in the right panel of fig.2 gives an upper limit for our data accuracy ( @xmath23 in units of @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "both overdoped samples ( left panels , fig.2 and 3 ) exhibit a similar behavior : @xmath22 increases steadily as @xmath15 decreases , approximately by the same amount .",
    "this increase results from a single mechanism , which does not depend upon the details of the fermi surface : the quasiparticle ( qp ) scattering rate is overall decreasing as the temperature decreases , thus putting more and more spectral weight in the drude - like peak at low energy .",
    "@xmath22 is the smallest at the largest cut - off ; this is the expected trend since the f - sum rule must be eventually satisfied at large frequencies .",
    "note that in the case of bscco , at 20000  @xmath17 , @xmath22 lies indeed almost within the experimental error , while the f - sum rule is not fulfilled yet at this energy in pcco .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize is that the overdoped samples exhibit a metallic behavior , associated with a closed fermi surface , and there is no hint as t decreases , of a modification of this fermi surface .    in underdoped pcco ( fig.2 , right panel ) ,",
    "as @xmath15 is lowered from 300  k , the spectral weight increases as observed in the overdoped samples : this is a signature of a metallic state .",
    "the material remains metallic down to 25k , as certified by a drude - like peak ( shown in the inset of fig.1 ) in @xmath24 . below @xmath16  150  k ,",
    "the trend is reversed : @xmath22 decreases .",
    "this can be understood without the need of a specific model .",
    "the optical conductivity is an average over the * k * space . since",
    "a metallic behavior is present down to 25  k , the observed decrease implies that the fermi surface breaks into arcs , possibly due to a partial gap ( pseudogap ) opening along specific @xmath25 values ( identified by arpes ) .",
    "the qp states which vanish at those @xmath25 values no longer contribute to the drude peak , and are transferred at high energy , hence a decrease of the low energy spectral weight below 150  k. the characteristic energy scale of this pseudogap lies in the range 2000 - 3000  @xmath17 .",
    "it corresponds to the maximum seen in the optical conductivity at @xmath16  1700  @xmath17 ( fig.1 , left panel ) .",
    "it is also is compatible with arpes data @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight in the underdoped bscco sample does not decrease whatever the cut - off frequency although it was independently experimentally established that a pseudogap is present below a temperature t@xmath9 in this material ( in this specific sample , from the resistance measurement , @xmath6  @xmath16  130  k @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , figure 3 ( right panel ) shows that , at @xmath26  @xmath17 , the spectral weight levels off .",
    "the temperature where this levelling off occurs is @xmath16  140  k. @xmath22 remains constant down to @xmath27 , showing no decrease as compared to underdoped pcco .",
    "moreover , this plateau appears only for cut - offs beyond 3000  @xmath17 . at lower energy ,",
    "the metallic contribution is the dominant mechanism for spectral weight redistribution .",
    "if this observation was to be related to the onset of the pseudogap , it would imply that the spectral weight redistribution extends far beyond our full experimental range , unlike pcco ( in fig.2 , right panel , the spectral weight is eventually conserved at 20000  @xmath17 ) .",
    "a further concern is that in underdoped bscco single crystals , this plateau is not seen @xcite .",
    "hence its possible interpretation in terms of a pseudogap certainly requires one more step in the analysis .",
    "having shown that the overdoped samples display a metallic behavior , we propose to normalize , within the experimental error , the spectral weight of the underdoped sample to the overdoped one at 300  k. this is shown in fig.5 for @xmath288000  @xmath17 , for the sake of a comparison with single crystals .",
    "similar plots can be found for pcco samples in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "after normalizing so , both samples appear to have a similar metallic behavior down to @xmath16  140  k , within the error bars . next we superimpose single crystals data at @xmath2810000  @xmath17 @xcite , also normalizing @xmath19(300  k ) of the underdoped crystal to the overdoped one .",
    "these two different sets of data turn out to be in surprisingly good agreement .",
    "moreover , the spectral weight increases less rapidly in the underdoped sample than in the overdoped one , below approximately the same temperature .",
    "the difference develops and reaches @xmath16  0.005 , still larger than our error bar .",
    "therefore , in this respect , we observe `` missing spectral weight '' below @xmath16  140  k. we suggest that it is a ( subtle ) signature of the onset of the pseudogap in underdoped bscco .",
    "according to the terminology recalled above , the pseudogap in bscco is a `` low energy '' one , whereas in pcco it would be a `` high energy '' one .",
    "if such a distinction is valid , then different mechanisms for the onset of these pseudogaps may very well be at stake , as suggested by numerous authors .",
    "these pseudogaps might however be related : in hole doped cuprates , the broad feature in arpes tracks the low energy pseudogap @xcite ) .",
    "our contribution here is to show that both have an optical signature in terms of missing spectral weight , although the signatures are qualitatively and quantitatively different",
    ". more accurate studies of the in - plane conductivity in hole - doped materials are still necessary in order to allow a more comprehensive comparison with the pseudogap in n  type materials .",
    "from the temperature dependence of the spectral weight in n - type pcco cuprates , one can clearly see that the fermi surface breaks off into arcs due to the opening of a pseudogap . in p - type bscco samples ,",
    "the pseudogap does not give rise to such a clearcut signature .",
    "we used the metallic temperature variation of the overdoped sample as a reference variation .",
    "doing so , the temperature dependence for the underdoped samples departs at a temperature @xmath6 from the reference temperature dependence .",
    "this difference is large for pcco ( 10  % ) , but does not exceed 1.5  % in terms of the total spectral weight in bscco .",
    "we suggest that in the latter compound , it is a subtle signature of the pseudogap . whether the difference relates to a basic one _ i.e. _ a different mechanism for these partial gaps , remains to be settled .",
