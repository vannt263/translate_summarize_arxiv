    "curvature perturbations evaluated on comoving hypersurfaces , @xmath1 , are constant on super - horizon scales , and their spectrum is given by   @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hubble parameter , @xmath4 is the derivative of the inflaton @xmath5 with respect to the cosmological time , and the subscript `` @xmath6 '' means that the expression is to be evaluated at the horizon crossing time , @xmath7 .",
    "this equation indicates that the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations is almost scale - invariant in slow - roll inflation models composed of a single scalar field",
    ".    however , in making realistic models of inflation based on supersymmetry and supergravity theories , it seems more natural to consider models composed of a multi - component scalar field , in which the slow - roll conditions are also possibly violated  @xcite .",

    "( [ standard ] ) is not sufficient to evaluate the spectrum of the curvature perturbations generated in such models . in order to identify necessary conditions for viable models of inflation among various proposed possibilities , any simple and sufficiently accurate formula for the spectrum",
    "is useful , especially if the formula is applicable to a wide class of models .",
    "there are several works aiming at generalizing the slow - roll formula  ( [ standard ] ) in the case of a single scalar field .",
    "for example , leach , sasaki , wands and liddle  @xcite have analyzed the evolution of curvature perturbations on superhorizon scales ( the long - wavelength approximation ) . they have found that the curvature perturbations can be enhanced when @xmath8 decreases after the horizon crossing time @xmath9 .",
    "this situation can happen if the slow - roll conditions are violated for @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , stewart  @xcite has generalized the standard formula ( [ standard ] ) , removing the extra assumption that slow - roll parameters are approximately scale invariant , and this generalization is called the general slow - roll approximation . under the conditions which lead to the standard slow - roll formula  ( [ standard ] ) , the running of spectrum is automatically suppressed as @xmath11 , while under the general slow - roll conditions , @xmath12 can be as large as @xmath13 .",
    "these conditions are consistent with recent observational data  @xcite .    for multi - component inflation , evaluating the curvature perturbations",
    "is a more difficult issue in comparison with single - component inflation @xcite .",
    "generally , in the case of a @xmath14-component field , the evolution equations for the perturbations are @xmath14 coupled second order differential equations .",
    "it is a heavy task to solve the full set of equations .",
    "moreover , for multi - component inflation , the curvature perturbations on comoving slices , @xmath15 , still varies in time on super - horizon scales until the neighboring trajectories of the background homogeneous universe in the phase space practically converge to a single one .",
    "it is after the convergence of the trajectories that @xmath15 becomes constant in time  @xcite .",
    "however , in the estimation of the spectrum , what we need is only the final value of the curvature perturbation @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath17 is a conformal time given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is taken sufficiently late after the convergence of the background trajectories .",
    "so , if we can identify the part of perturbations that contributes to @xmath16 , we may solve only that part to obtain its value without solving the full set of perturbation equations .",

    "we derived a perturbation equation for a single projected component of scalar field corresponding to the perturbation of @xmath20folding number .",
    "the derivation of the new @xmath0 formalism is rather intuitive in this sense , which helps to make its physical meaning rather transparent . as a drawback",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ secdeltan ]",
    ", we briefly explain the perturbation equations for multi - component scalar field in the flat slicing . in section [ wronskian ]",
    ", we introduce a wronskian between two solutions of perturbation equations , and explain how we can use it in evaluating the curvature perturbation at a later time @xmath21 .",
    "as far as we are concerned with the evolution during the phase dominated by the scalar field , what we have to do turns out to be just solving a single mode backward in time with appropriate boundary conditions imposed at @xmath22 . in section [",
    "extended ] , we use the wronskian to derive more explicit analytic expressions for the spectrum of perturbations .",
    "we consider an extension of the general slow - roll formula developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , combining it with the long wavelength approximation  @xcite , which suites for describing the late time evolution  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the general slow - roll approximation is valid until a time @xmath23 later than the horizon crossing time @xmath24 , and we use the long - wavelength approximation for the succeeding evolution until the end of inflation , @xmath25 .",
    "to combine the two solutions obtained by using different approximation schemes in the matching region where both approximations are valid , we find that the constancy of the wronskian is again very useful .",
    "the derived new analytic formula applies for a wider class of multi - component inflation models . in section [ secsingle ] , we reduce the obtained formula to the single - field case . in this case , the formula for the spectrum can be expressed more explicitly . using our new formulation , it is also easy to see that the amplitude of perturbation stays regular even if the time derivative of @xmath5 vanishes , as was discussed in ref .",

    "if we do not consider the case with isocurvature perturbations that persist until the present epoch , we can assume that the convergence of trajectories occurs at a certain time , but it need not happen during the scalar dominant phase .",

    "hence , with the aid of the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite , even if the phase space trajectories converge only after the scalar dominant phase ends , we can still evaluate the final value of the curvature perturbation by evaluating the wronskian . yet",
    "an open question is whether the perturbation in the true @xmath65-folding number , @xmath79 , is well approximated by @xmath0 , which is determined by the dynamics of the homogeneous universe for the case with general matter fields .",
    "we plan to discuss this issue in our future publication  @xcite .    as a good example to show the efficiency of the new formulation using the wronskian , we have presented a quick derivation of an improved general slow - roll formula",

    "@xcite that there are cases in which they may not be negligible at all .",
    "the improvement that has been incoorporated for the first time in this paper is to use a systematic long - wavelength expansion for the late time evolution after horizon crossing .",
    "the matching of the two approximations , the general slow - roll approximation and the long wavelength expansion , has been easily performed by using the constancy of the wronskian .",
