    "we have investigated the sensitivity of a gc pulsar stack search at effelsberg by considering the following : assuming the gc pulsars have the same properties as the current known population of disk pulsars we have derived their expected flux density at 18.95 ghz assuming an average spectral index of @xmath7 and placed at the distance of the gc . from these values the expected detection signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) has been calculated for a single 2 hour 25 minute observation .",

    "each observation has been independently searched for periodic and impulsive signals in addition to a search of the combination of all 14 observations . in the data taken so far",
    "no pulsars have been detected . assuming minimal atmospheric contributions to the system temperature we can place upper limits on the flux density of normal pulsars ( 10 per cent duty cycle ) within 1.7 pc of sgr a@xmath0 at the observing frequency of 18.95 ghz :      we propose to continue observations of the sgr a@xmath0 region since the emission beams of pulsars in close orbits could precess into the line - of - sight on the timescale of years ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* macquart et al .",
    "for the target pulsars our stacking algorithm poses a problem .",
    "such pulsars may have significant line - of - sight acceleration as they move in the gravitational potential of sgr a@xmath0 and thus would show doppler changes in their pulse frequency .",
    "after data combination , doppler shifts could smear the signal and reduce the spectral s / n . to counteract doppler effects caused by orbital motion we are investigating ` stack - slide searches ' where the spectra are added with different trial frequency offsets ."
