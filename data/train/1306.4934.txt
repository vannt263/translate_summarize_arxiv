    "the model of a two - user gic in _ standard form _ is introduced shortly : this discrete - time , memoryless interference channel is characterized by the following equations that relate the paired inputs @xmath4 and outputs @xmath5 : @xmath6 where the cross - link gains @xmath7 and @xmath8 are time - invariant , the inputs and outputs are real valued , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote additive real - valued gaussian noise samples .",

    "the model assumes that there is no cooperation between the transmitters , not between the receivers .",

    "the random vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 have i.i.d .",
    "gaussian entries with zero mean and unit variance , and they are independent of the inputs @xmath23 and @xmath24 . furthermore , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be assumed to be independent since the capacity region of a two - user , discrete - time , memoryless interference channel depends only on the marginal _",
    "pdf_s @xmath25 for @xmath16 ( as the receivers do not cooperate ) .",
    "finally , perfect synchronization between the pairs of transmitters and receivers allows time - sharing between the users , which implies that the capacity region is convex .    depending on the values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the two - user gic is classified into weak , strong , mixed , one - sided and degraded gic .",

    "both corner points of the capacity region are yet unknown .",
    "the operational meaning of the study of the corner points of the capacity region for a two - user gic is to explore the situation where one transmitter sends its information at the maximal achievable rate for a single user ( in the absence of interference ) , and the second transmitter maintains a data rate that enables reliable communication to the two non - cooperating receivers @xcite .",
