    "the physics of cold atoms is an important ingredient in the emerging field of quantum technology , either providing elements for demanding applications or a transparent testing ground for ideas and methods  @xcite .",
    "this is made possible by sophisticated control of both translational and internal degrees of freedom for neutral atoms with electromagnetic fields , demonstrated especially by laser cooling and trapping methods  @xcite .",
    "one of the most notable successes has been the reaching of quantum degeneracy , i.e. , bose - einstein condensation with bosonic atoms , and cooper pairing with fermionic atoms  @xcite . here",
    "the key tools have been evaporative cooling and magnetic trapping , as reaching the ultralow temperatures and high densities with laser light is usually hampered by heating and loss of atoms due to light - assisted atomic collisions  @xcite or reabsorption of scattered photons  @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling , however , is rather wasteful of atoms and requires fast thermalizing collisions , which limits its practicality in some cases , such as single - species fermionic gases  @xcite , atomic clocks  @xcite , or small samples of cold atoms  @xcite , and especially transversal cooling of atomic beams  @xcite .",
    "very recently , for instance , fermionic atoms have been efficiently laser cooled using narrow optical transitions , which lead to low doppler temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the same approach has been used earlier with alkaline - earth atoms , for the purpose of building atomic clocks for optical wavelengths  @xcite . in general , state - insensitive traps are needed for quantum state engineering and precision metrology  @xcite .",
    "similarly , one needs to develop alternatives also for evaporative cooling . a simple possibility is to develop further the concept of raman cooling ; one of the aspects that can be improved is the robustness in respect to the laser pulse parameters .",
    "one of the success stories in robust quantum control of internal state dynamics is the use of adiabatic following of eigenstates , i.e. , stimulated rapid adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite .",
    "as known e.g. with molecular dynamics  @xcite , it can also be used to control motional degrees of freedom .",
    "raman cooling  @xcite is one the most efficient non - evaporative techniques for optical cooling of atoms below the one - photon recoil limit .",
    "the cooling efficiency is associated with population transfer which is typically generated by a @xmath1-pulse that has a blackman  @xcite or a square  @xcite envelope .",
    "although such a @xmath1-pulse operates efficiently on atoms corresponding to the resonant velocity group , the process requires extreme control of the pulse amplitude and duration .",
    "even though some optimization can be obtained for the method  @xcite , an approach based on adiabatic passage is of definite interest due to its robustness regarding pulse amplitudes and durations .",
    "however , the use of adiabatic passage in raman cooling is not possible without having an exact understanding of its velocity - selective properties . in this paper",
    "we present a careful analysis of the raman cooling via pulses , and show that subrecoil temperatures are attainable .    the possibility to use adiabatic passage for optical cooling",
    "was demonstrated by korsunsky  @xcite , being applied to  @xcite cooling .",
    "raman cooling is a much greater challenge which requires a careful analysis of the velocity selection process .",
    "another difficulty consists in a reasonable choice of adiabatic passage which would demonstrate a benefit from its usage in raman cooling .",
    "for instance , raman cooling employing rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) was presented in papers  @xcite , where the amplitude and the frequency of raman pulses are changed in a controlled way , producing a velocity - selective transfer of the atomic population .",
    "the extent of the frequency - chirp determines the range of excitation by rap and makes it possible to transfer even the wing of the velocity distribution .",
    "however , rap does not give an appreciable advantage over ordinary raman cooling , because the excitation profile depends on the amount of chirping , the pulse area and its envelope .",
    "the theory presented in this paper shows that the utilization of stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( )  @xcite in contrast leads to a crucial growth of cooling robustness .",
    "in fact , once the adiabaticity criterion is fulfilled , the velocity selection in a case of large upper - level detuning depends only on the pulse amplitudes , allowing wide variations in the pulse duration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after describing the basic atom - pulse setup in sec .",

    "in sec .  [ sec : v_select ] we discuss the velocity selection process and in sec .  [",

    "as the full cooling process requires a series of these cycles , and the adiabaticity criterion should be fulfilled for each cycle , we formulate in sec .  [",

    "@xcite ) , and b ) using stirap pulses of substantially different amplitudes , but not changing their duration and amplitude during the pulse cycle series . in the latter case ,",
    "the amplitudes are adjusted to transfer the wing of the velocity distribution together with the possibility to cool the atomic ensemble below the recoil limit .",
    "the cooling results for a series of cycles for these two different transfer types are presented and discussed .",
