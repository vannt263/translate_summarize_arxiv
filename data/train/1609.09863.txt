    "the non - commutativity of space - time coordinates ( henceforth referred to simply as `` non - commutativity '' ) was initially proposed as an alternative to solve the problem of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in quantum electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "the first model that appeared in this context was studied by snyder in 1947@xcite , but the idea of non - commutativity was subdued by the success of renormalization theory to deal with uv divergences . for some time , the notion of non - commutative manifolds was mostly developed in the context of mathematics and mathematical physics by connes , woronowics and drinfeld@xcite , among others , while some physical applications started to be discussed in the beginning of this century@xcite .",
    "a main motivation for the contemporary interest in the non - commutativity is linked to the idea that in a quantum theory which incorporates gravity , the nature of space - time may change in short distances , near to planck scales@xcite . in string theory",
    ", the non - commutativity appears in a natural way in the low energy limit in the presence of a constant background neveu - schwarz two - form @xmath1@xcite , leading to an effective field theory that lives in a space - time where coordinates have nontrivial commutation relations of the form @xmath2=\\left(b^{-1}\\right)^{\\mu\\nu}\\thinspace.\\label{eq : canonicalnc}\\ ] ] the simplicity of this particular type of non - commutativity , where the commutators of space - time coordinates is a constant tensor , allows the definition of non - commutative versions of known quantum field models in a way that is very well suited for perturbative calculations .",
    "this approach became known as _",
    "canonical non - commutativity _ , and it was extensively studied in@xcite .",
    "supersymmetric models with canonical non - commutativity could be easily defined since the deformation given in does not interfere with the grassmanian coordinates of the superspace@xcite , and it was in fact shown that susy was an important ingredient to tame some of the potentially dangerous uv / ir divergences present in non - commutative models@xcite .",
    "the canonical non - commutativity was even considered in the context of non - relativistic quantum mechanical models , where several interesting effects were unveiled@xcite .",
    "the canonical non - commutativity , however , involves a preferential direction in space - time , given by the constant background tensor in , inducing an explicit violation of lorentz invariance .",
    "it is an interesting and nontrivial problem to introduce non - commutativity in space - time while still preserving lorentz invariance : one possibility to do this is by means of the hopf algebra formalism .",
    "in@xcite , it was shown that although canonical non - commutative theories violate the lorentz invariance , they respect another closely related symmetry , namely the twisted lorentz symmetry . in the context of hopf algebras , the twisted lorentz symmetry can be understood as a deformation of the standard poincar algebra by means of a drinfeld twist@xcite , such that the poincar algebra is not deformed , while the co - algebra is .",
    "the reader can find some studies in the literature regarding hopf algebras and deformations associated to lie algebras in@xcite , for example .",
    "given the interest in the study of theories with non - commutativity in space - time , it became a natural question to introduce the same ideas in the superspace , looking for supersymmetric models that live in deformed superspaces .",
    "besides the already quoted possibility of the canonical case , in which the supersymmetry structure of the models is left untouched by the deformation , one may entertain the possibility of building non - anticomutative ( nac ) models , where the algebra of the grassmanian coordinates is deformed .",
    "general superspace deformations where considered in@xcite , where it was shown for example that preserving the associativity of the product of superfields can only be achieved in very specific cases .",
    "the possibility of nac deformations was also shown to appear in the context of superstring theory@xcite , in which case the non - anticomutativity of the grassmanian coordinates is associated to the presence of a symmetric constant graviphoton field @xmath3 , viz .",
    "@xmath4 where latin indices are indices of two - component spinors .",
    "this deformation is only possible in euclidean space - times , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not related by complex conjugation .",
    "besides , the deformation described by eq . breaks half of the original supersymmetry , hence this construction became known as @xmath7 susy .",
    "more explicitly , one may observe that the only anticommutation relation between supercharges that are modified by the background tensor @xmath3 is @xmath8 in practice , the anticommutation relations in eq .",
    "can be introduced in a given supersymmetric action by replacing the usual product of superfields by the moyal product @xmath9 using the star product , it is possible to define a deformed wess - zumino ( wz ) lagrangian @xmath10 in this case the supercharge @xmath11 generates a symmetry of the theory , while @xmath12 does not , showing again that only half of the supersymmetry is preserved by . by expanding the moyal products in in a ( finite ) power series in @xmath3 , and then integrating in the grassmann coordinates to obtain the deformed wz action in terms of component fields",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the auxiliary field contained in @xmath15 and @xmath16 the undeformed wz action .",
    "this result shows that the nac in this case amounts to the addition of a single term in the lagrangian , proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "the study of the quantum properties of the @xmath18 wz model was reported in@xcite , using the spurion field formalism to include the @xmath17 term present in eq . within the standard superfield formalism .",
    "renormalization was shown to be possible but quite nontrivial , since a finite number of additional counterterms have to be included in the theory to absorb uv divergences of the quantum effective action .    in @xmath19 dimensions ,",
    "the structure of supersymmetric models is simpler in a sense , since the grassmann coordinates @xmath5 are real ( due to the lorentz group being related to @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 as in @xmath22 dimensions ) , and the notion of chirality is absent .",
    "this simplicity , however , seems to leave less room to define deformations of supersymmetry that still preserve at least some of the interesting properties of supersymmetric models .",
    "some options were first discussed in@xcite , where the strategy was to start with @xmath23 susy , which was brought down to @xmath0 by the deformation .",
    "the problem of deformation of @xmath23 three - dimensional susy have been revisited recently@xcite , mostly motivated by the search of deformed variants of abjm theories@xcite .    in this paper , we want to investigate one alternative way to introduce nac in three - dimensional susy that has not yet been developed , which is the use of twisted symmetries . in the case of four - dimensional susy , there was some extensive work investigating several possible deformations@xcite .",
    "however , it was already pointed out that algebraic consistency is not enough to ensure the construction of physically meaningful models .",
    "in@xcite , two different twist deformations of four - dimensional susy were throughly examined , and it was found that one may write actions in terms of superfields that , despite being formally covariant , are actually not invariant under susy transformations . even if this problem can be circumvented in order do define a deformed wz model at the classical level , investigation of the quantum corrections showed that it turn out to be non - renormalizable . the need to preserve the notion of chirality ( by means of the introduction of non - linear projection operators ) was at the core of the problems reported in@xcite ,",
    "so one might wonder whether the situation in three - dimensional case , where there is no chirality , could be better .",
    "the formalism of twist deformations would be particularly interesting in three dimensions because it could potentially implement nac in an @xmath0 supersymmetric model , since on the hopf algebraic description , one may deform only the co - algebra and not the algebra itself .",
    "an undeformed susy algebra would mean , in principle , a nac model invariant under the same susy transformations as the undeformed one , but with a deformed leibnitz rule when the supercharges act on the product of superfields .",
    "however , we will show that the same problems found in four - dimensional models appear here : the component version of the most natural definition of a deformed wz model fails to be supersymmetric invariant , and when quantum corrections are calculated using the superfield formalism , the model turns out to be non - renormalizable .",
    "the end result is that susy in @xmath19 dimensions , despite being somehow simpler in structure , seems to impose stringent restrictions on the possible nac deformations one can consistently define , even when the algebraic machinery of hopf algebras is used .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section[hopfalgebra ] , we give a brief review of susy in the language of hopf algebras ( for a more detailed review , see the discussion of the four - dimensional case in@xcite , for example ) .",
    "the deformation of the supersymmetry algebra using a twist element is introduced in section[twistdeformation ] . in section[twistdeformation ] we define a covariant field theory under the deformed algebra , which would be the deformed version of the wz model . we discuss the basic properties of this model , showing how despite being written in terms of covariant superfields and operators , the action fails to be invariant under component supersymmetry transformations .",
    "regardless this issue , the model can be quantized and its renormalization studied , by using the spurion technique , and in section[quantumproperties ] we show that the models turns out to be non - renormalizable .",
    "section[sec : concluding - remarks ] contains our conclusions . the notations and conventions of@xcite are used throughout the text .",
    "the supersymmetric poincar superalgebra has an universal enveloping algebra which has the natural structure of a hopf superalgebra",
    ". this construction preserves the main properties of the usual susy algebra , such as the anticommutators and the jacobi identities@xcite .",
    "indeed , the susy algebra in @xmath19 dimensions , which will be denoted by @xmath24 is given by ,    [ eq : the - supersymmetry - algebra ] @xmath25 & = 0\\,,\\\\ \\left\\ { q_{a},q_{b}\\right\\ }   & = 2p_{ab}\\,,\\\\ \\left[q_{a},p_{cd}\\right ] & = 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath26 is the generator of space - time translations , represented as a bispinor .",
    "the universal enveloping algebra @xmath27 is defined as the quotient of the sum of tensor products of the original algebra @xmath24 by the ideal generated by the ( anti)commutations relations .",
    "the hopf algebra structure of @xmath27 is encoded by the coproduct , product and antipode given by @xmath28 where in eq .",
    "we have used the sweedler notation@xcite , and @xmath29 .",
    "the algebraic structure is encoded in the adjoint action of one operator @xmath30 into another @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the usual parity function .",

    "the superfield themselves encompass an algebra with product @xmath38 , which in the standard ( undeformed ) case is given by the pointwise product @xmath39 in the hopf algebra formalism , the leibniz rule is represented by the covariant action of the hopf algebra on the algebra of the superfields , i.e. , @xmath40 which , for the undeformed coproduct , reduces the usual leibnitz rule , @xmath41    superfields can be decomposed in terms of component fields . for the simplest case of a scalar superfield @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are scalar and spinorial fields , and @xmath14 is an auxiliary field .",
    "susy transformation are generated by the supercharges @xmath11 , @xmath46 which in terms of component fields amounts to , @xmath47 in the undeformed case , @xmath11 is represented by a first order differential operator , which satisfies the standard leibnitz rule when applied on product of superfields , @xmath48 which , in the hopf algebra formalism , is encoded by the standard coproduct .",
    "in the hopf algebra formalism , the deformation can be introduced as a drinfeld twist@xcite .",
    "one starts by choosing a twist element , which we postulate is given by    [ eq : twistelement ] @xmath49,\\\\ \\mathcal{f}^{-1 } & = \\overline{f}^{a}\\otimes\\bar{f}_{a}=\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\,c^{ab}\\:\\partial_{a}\\otimes\\partial_{b}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is a symmetric matrix by including the grassmanian derivatives @xmath50 as new generators , in equal footing to @xmath51 , @xmath37 and @xmath26 .",
    "this can be done without spoiling the algebraic consistency of the construction . ] .",
    "the twist element can be shown to satisfy the 2-cocycle condition @xmath52 which guarantees associativity of the construction .",
    "this is similar to the twist considered in@xcite .    since the grassmanian derivatives are nilpotent and anticommutative , when expanded in powers of @xmath53 we find @xmath54 to be finite , @xmath55 such as in the @xmath18 susy@xcite , and in the twisted supersymmetry model studied in@xcite , both in four space - time dimensions , but differently from the three - dimensional deformation considered in@xcite , in which the expansion of the moyal product has infinite terms .",
    "it is also interesting to stress that , differently from what happens in four dimensions , a similar twist involving the supercovariant derivative @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 would not be finite , since the @xmath58 s do not anticommute among themselves , so we do not consider a  \" d - deformation  \" as in@xcite , which would be much more complicated in our case .",
    "the deformation is implemented on the algebra of superfields by means of the deformed star product given by @xmath59 the start product introduce nac in the superspace , since @xmath60=\\left[x^{mn}\\:\\overset{\\star}{,}\\;\\theta^{a}\\right]=0\\,,\\thinspace\\left\\ { \\theta^{a}\\:\\overset{\\star}{,}\\:\\theta^{b}\\right\\ } = c^{ab}\\,,\\label{non commutativity}\\ ] ] where these @xmath61 ( anti)commutators are defined by replacing the usual product of functions by the star product .    in the context of @xmath18 susy , the deformation of the poincar superalgebra is obtained by formally calculating the anticommutators of the generators , taking into account eq .. this would lead to @xmath62 where the breaking of susy becomes manifest .",
    "however , in the hopf algebra formalism , this is actually not correct since the star product is , at this point , defined only for superfields , and not for operators . to properly define the star ( anti)commutators , we extend the discussion presented in@xcite for the case of graded superalgebras .",
    "we define the star product between two elements of the superalgebra @xmath27 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , the adjoint action defined in . with this definition , one can calculate for example @xmath65 reproducing the result in eq .. the same can be done for the other generators .    in the context of twisted deformations , for any of the operators @xmath31",
    "that generate @xmath27 , one may associate a new ( deformed ) generator @xmath66 , @xmath67 also belonging to @xmath27 , in such a way that @xmath66 satisfies the original , undeformed algebra@xcite .",
    "this is a clear advantage of this formalism .",
    "for example , considering the supersymmetric generator @xmath51 , we have @xmath68 and one can verify that @xmath69 clearly , @xmath70 is not linear in the generators of the algebra , so indeed it fits only within the hopf algebraic machinery , and not the usual lie algebra formalism . if we consider @xmath70 as the generator of supersymmetry transformations , we can say we constructed a deformed nac superspace , while still preserving supersymmetry .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the possibility of defining nonlinear generators which satisfy the undeformed algebra was already briefly pointed out in different contexts@xcite .",
    "in@xcite , for example , it was considered an @xmath23 three - dimensional superspace with real grassmanian coordinates @xmath71 , and the deformed algebra @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the deformation parameter . in this formalism , the susy transformation generated by @xmath74 is preserved , while the one generated by @xmath75 is lost , as can be seen by inspecting their anticommutation relations , @xmath76 one may however define the nonlinear generators @xmath77 which satisfy the usual ( undeformed ) supersymmetry algebra , @xmath78 but this possibility was not fully developed in@xcite insomuch as those new generators were represented by nonlinear operators .",
    "we see that the deformed generators given in eq fit naturally within the hopf algebra formalism , realizing an instance of twisted supersymmetry .",
    "the coproduct for the deformed generators is defined by @xmath79 which is compatible with the star product in eq .",
    ", meaning that @xmath80    the action of the deformed generators on a single superfield can be , in a slight abuse of notation , defined as @xmath81 meaning the action of the operator @xmath66 mimics that of the undeformed generator @xmath31 when acting on a single superfield@xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath66 on a product of superfields is deformed according to the coproduct . for the supersymmetry generators ,",
    "this means that the susy transformation of a single superfield is undeformed , @xmath82 however , due to the deformed coproduct given in eq .",
    ", the susy transformation of a star product of superfields is modified according to @xmath83 in essence , in this formalism the effect of the deformation is to modify the leibnitz rule according to which supercharges act on products of superfields , while the algebra of supercharges itself is not modified .",
    "this formalism should allows us to define actions involving superfields that are , in principle , covariant under susy transformations . as we will show in the next section , however , this does not guarantee the actual susy invariance of the model when projected to the physical ( component ) fields .",
    "we consider the deformed wz action in @xmath19 dimensions , @xmath84 where @xmath85 this is the standard wz action , with the usual products replaced by the star products defined in eq .. using integration by parts , one may show from eq .",
    "that @xmath86 where @xmath87 are arbitrary superfields . from this property , together with eq .",
    ", we can show that the quadratic term in eq .",
    "remains undeformed , @xmath88\\thinspace.\\ ] ]    as for the cubic interaction terms they reduce to the usual wz interactions together with an additional term , @xmath89 or , in terms of components fields , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the usual wz interaction lagrangian .",
    "the situation here is similar to the case of @xmath18 susy@xcite , where also the final effect of the deformation in the wz model is the addition of a single interaction term involving the auxiliary field @xmath14 in the action .    despite our construction being formally",
    "covariant , to ensure the physical consistency we have to project the superfield action in term of the ( physical ) component fields , and verify explicitly the susy invariance .",
    "we start with the quadratic terms in eq . , and using eq . , we can write @xmath93 because this expression is integrated we can use the property , together with eq .",
    ", to obtain @xmath94 it is easy to verify that the two terms in the second line of the previous equation cancel among each other , therefore , @xmath95 where eq .",
    "was used in the last line .",
    "this final expression is clearly susy invariant .",
    "the same procedure can be used to argue for the susy invariance of the remaining quadratic term @xmath96 .",
    "however , upon explicit calculation , the additional interaction term in eq , is not invariant under the deformed susy transformation . to verify that",
    ", we remember that the integration over grassmanian coordinates amounts to projecting the last component , proportional to @xmath97 , of the integrand .",
    "so , susy invariance of eq .",
    "means that the @xmath97 component of @xmath98 should be at the most a surface term .",
    "the action of @xmath99 is distributed among the factors in the star product by the deformed leibnitz rule , eq .. using also eq . , we have @xmath100 also because of , all the terms in the first line of this last equation are equal . for the second and third lines ,",
    "explicit expansion of the star products yields @xmath101 while the third line vanishes .",
    "therefore @xmath102 finally , using eqs . , and , projecting out only the terms proportional to @xmath97 , after some algebraic manipulations , we arrive at @xmath103+\\nonumber \\\\   & + \\frac{i}{4}c^{mn}c^{pq}\\:\\epsilon_{pm}\\xi^{a}\\left[2\\:\\partial_{na}\\psi_{q}\\cdot f^{2}-\\psi_{q}\\partial_{na}f^{2}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is not a surface term .",
    "for this reason the model is not invariant under deformed susy .",
    "this lack of susy invariance is a surprise in this formalism since , differently from the @xmath18 case in @xmath22 dimensions@xcite , or also the three - dimensional deformations studied in@xcite , in the twist deformation we are considering the deformation is introduced in a way that the covariance of superfields and the algebra of supercharges is not deformed .",
    "however , this lack of susy invariance in the component formulation , despite the formally covariant construction was already pointed out in @xmath22 dimensions in@xcite , where the twist formalism was also used . there",
    ", the lack of invariance was attributed to the need of introducing non - local projection operators to maintain the notion of chirality .",
    "indeed , in the four - dimensional case , one has to apply ( anti)chiral projectors , @xmath104 to star products of ( anti)chirals superfields to maintain ( anti)chirality .",
    "however , this introduces an ambiguity in the definition of the deformed trilinear interaction term , since for example both @xmath105 and @xmath106 are acceptable , however upon explicit calculation , it was shown that the first expression is not susy invariant , while the second is .",
    "this is rather surprising since both are formally covariant .",
    "we find that , even in the absence of non - local projection operators , the formal covariance of the superfield action is not enough to guarantee the susy invariance of the model .",
    "this seems to be a rather important shortcoming of the hopf algebra formalism in the definition of consistent deformed superfield theories .",
    "despite the problem with susy invariance unveiled in the previous section , one may still wonder about the quantum properties of the model defined by eq .. indeed , this model might still define a consistent , yet non - supersymmetric , quantum field theory .",
    "functional quantization of eq .",
    "is possible by means of the methods similar to the ones used in the context of @xmath18 models in@xcite : the nac deformation amounts to the addition of the single ( non - invariant ) term in the action , and this could be incorporated in the superfield formalism by means of a spurion field given by @xmath107 where we used the definition . in this way",
    ", we may rewrite eq . as follows , @xmath108\\thinspace.\\label{action superfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after we have written the action in this form , we can use the standard tools of superspace perturbation theory .",

    "we take into account that we generate momentum factors through the algebraic relations @xmath117",

    "this result is different from that in four dimensions@xcite , where the value of @xmath114 which could yield a divergent diagram was bounded , so the number of potentially divergent diagrams was finite .",
    "the notion of chirality , essential to four - dimensional susy , imposes additional conditions on the manipulation of covariant superderivatives , such that actually one can just have a divergent diagram with @xmath127 , i.e. , with at the most a single @xmath113 insertion .",

    "these results indicate that , unless some unexpected cancellation or additional constraints can be shown to occur in the infinite number of potentially divergent diagrams , we have a non - renormalizable model .",
    "this is in contrast with the results found in @xmath18 models@xcite in four dimensions , despite the fact that in our case the final effect of the deformation in the classical action is the inclusion of a single additional interaction term , as in those papers . despite the similarities in the diagrammatic expansion of both cases , the existence of the notion of chirality in four space - time dimensions imposes additional constraints in the power counting of the model , which contributes to ensure renormalizability .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to remark that wz models in @xmath22 dimensions deformed by means of a drinfeld twist were also shown to be non - renormalizable@xcite , similarly to what we found in our model .",
    "the deformation of supersymmetric models using the concept of a drinfeld twist preserves several important algebraic properties of the susy algebra , and it could allow for the definition of deformed supersymmetric models with interesting properties .",
    "however , when trying to put the hopf algebraic formalism to work in a specific physical model , one often encounters difficulties .",
    "in@xcite , for example , a particular twist in four space - time dimensions was considered , and it was shown that even a formally supersymmetric covariant action involving superfields could fail to be susy invariant , when projected in terms of the component fields . in this case , the notion of chirality seems to be responsible for these problems , since it forces one to introduce non - local projection operators in the formalism .",
    "also , a simple generalization of the wz model failed to be renormalizable .    in three space - time dimensions ,",
    "there is no notion of chirality , so in principle the application of the drinfeld twist would be simpler , and could open up the possibility of studying deformed @xmath0 supersymmetric models , which is difficult to do in other formalisms . therefore , we studied a twist deformation of three - dimensional @xmath0 susy , and defined what would be the simplest non - anticommutative wz model in this context .",
    "however , we showed that this theory suffers from the same problems present in the four - dimensional case . at the classical level",
    ", the model fails to be invariant under deformed susy transformations , meaning that although the star product and the deformed coproduct are algebraically compatible , this compatibility does not guarantee actual susy invariance of the physical model under consideration . at the quantum level ,",
    "the wz model is finite at the one loop level , but at two loops there are an infinite number of potentially divergent diagrams , rendering the model non - renormalizable .",
    "our results reinforces the idea that algebraic consistency doest not , by itself , guarantee the definition of physically meaningful deformed models , either at the classical or at quantum level .",

    "<S> non - anticommutative deformations have been studied in the context of supersymmetry ( susy ) in three and four space - time dimensions , and the general picture is that highly nontrivial to deform supersymmetry in a way that still preserves some of its important properties , both at the formal algebraic level ( e.g. , preserving the associativity of the deformed theory ) as well as at the physical level ( e.g. , maintaining renormalizability ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hopf algebra formalism allows the definition of algebraically consistent deformations of susy , but this algebraic consistency does not guarantee that physical models build upon these structures will be consistent from the physical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> we will investigate a deformation induced by a drinfeld twist of the @xmath0 susy algebra in three space - time dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the hopf algebra formalism allows the construction of deformed @xmath0 susy algebras that should still preserve a deformed version of supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we will construct the simplest deformed version of the wess - zumino model in this context , but we will show that despite the consistent algebraic structure , the model in question is not invariant under susy transformation and is not renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> we will comment on the relation of these results with previous ones discussed in the literature regarding similar four - dimensional constructions . </S>"
