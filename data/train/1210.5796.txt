    "in fact , it is possible to measure the melting temperature of a film in lab . so experiment maybe is another way for solving mathematical problems .    in reality , the n - alkanes @xmath0 is not very rigid for large @xmath42 . the soft chain would bend into different configurations(fig .",
    "[ trimer ] ) . in that case , the entropy of longer polymer maybe is larger than shorter polymers",
    ". then we would meet the anomalous odd - even effect . for a more complicate case ,",
    "if we mix polymers of different length , it is almost impossible to get exact mathematical counting of all possible coverings .",
    "but we can divide the polymers into two classes : even - polymer and odd - polymers .",
    "the odd - even effect would still play a role .",
    "odd - even effect is a common phenomena in finite size system .",
    "if certain degree of freedom of a system is highly confined in finite scale , the physical observable would strongly depends on the confined dimensions .",
    "we study how the melting temperature and entropy depend on the finite width of a long dimer film . as a mathematical modeling of the melting process of a dimer film",
    ", we assumed there is a weak external bonding between neighboring dimers and defined the transition between a solid dimer phase and a liquid dimer phase .",

    "the entropy increase for fusing two odd rectangular film is bigger than that for fusing two even rectangular film . for torus film , only fusing two torus films with odd number of length increase the entropy . fusing two even torus films into a big torus film experiences an entropy decrease .",
    "this odd - even effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the entropy of a system tends to increase during a physical process .",
    "the correlation function of two loops on torus also depends on the odd - eveness of their length .",

    "we derived the equation of melting temperature in thermodynamic limit by studying a growing dimer film .",
    "the melting temperature is proportional to the external bonding energy and the inverse of entropy per site .",

    "we conjecture that the melting temperature computed by an extended dimer film model would still demonstrate odd - even dependence on the length of polymers . there might be a significant difference between two dimensional dimer film model and three dimensional dimer powder model .",
