    "a representation of closed @xmath0-manifolds by @xmath1-colored graphs has been independently introduced in the seventies by m. pezzana and in the eighties by s. lins ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , by using dual constructions .",
    "a @xmath1-colored graph is a regular graph of degree four , endowed with a proper edge - coloration ( i.e. , adjacent edges has different colors ) with four colors , and it represents a closed @xmath0-manifold if and only if a certain combinatorial condition is satisfied .",
    "this type of representation has been very fruitful with regard to the catalogation of closed @xmath0-manifolds in terms of increasing complexity , which in this context means number of vertices of the representing graph ( see @xcite , , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the extension of the representation by @xmath1-colored graphs to @xmath0-manifolds with boundary has been performed in @xcite , where any @xmath1-colored graph is associated to a compact @xmath0-manifold with ( possibly empty ) boundary without spherical components , this correspondence being surjective on the whole class of such manifolds .    as a consequence ,",
    "an efficient computer aided catalogation of @xmath0-manifolds with boundary can be performed by this tool .",
    "some computational results have been already obtained in @xcite , namely the classification of all manifolds representable by a graph of order @xmath2 in the orientable case and @xmath3 in the non - orientable one .    in the present paper",
    "our main goals are the creation of :    * the census of all non - isomorphic contracted bipartite @xmath1-colored graphs ( without @xmath4-dipoles ) of order @xmath5 , representing compact orientable @xmath0-manifolds with ( possibly disconnected ) toric boundary ; * the census of the prime @xmath0-manifolds represented by the above graphs ; * the catalogue of all manifolds in the above census which are complements of knots and links in the @xmath0-sphere , also giving , for each of such manifolds , the diagram of a corresponding knot / link .",
    "for ( a ) , we wrote a script that , for each positive integer @xmath6 , enumerates all non - isomorphic contracted @xmath1-colored graphs with @xmath7 vertices and no @xmath4-dipoles , representing compact bordered @xmath0-manifolds , possibly fixing the topological type of their boundary . in section  [ sec3 ] , after describing the enumeration process , we give computational results for @xmath8 with no restriction on the orientability and the topological type of the boundary ( see table  1 ) , and for @xmath9 in the case of graphs representing orientable manifolds with toric boundary ( see table  2 ) .    in order to get the census of ( b ) from the one of ( a )",
    ", three steps were necessary .",
    "the first one consisted in removing certain graphs which were not minimal among those representing the same manifold ( see lemma [ rho2 ] ) or which represented non - prime manifolds ( see lemma [ rho3 ] ) .    in the second step",
    ", for each contracted bipartite @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 of this `` reduced '' census we tried to identify the corresponding manifold @xmath11 by means of ` 3-manifold recognizer ` @xcite , which is a computer program for studying @xmath0-manifolds written by v. tarkaev according to an algorithm elaborated by s. matveev and other members of the chelyabinsk topology group . as a first result",
    ", we obtained a census of compact orientable @xmath0-manifolds with toric boundary not containing duplicates and non - prime manifolds .",
    "furthermore , all seifert manifolds and graph manifolds of waldhausen ( see @xcite ) were identified by means of their structure ( see subsections [ seifert ] and [ graph - manifolds ] ) . for the manifolds @xmath11 that were not identified by ` 3-manifold recognizer ` , the program returned the isomorphism signature of the triangulation corresponding to @xmath10 .    in the third step the classification",
    "was completed by using ` snappy ` , a computer program for studying the topology of @xmath0-manifolds , written by m. culler and n. dunfield using the snappea kernel by j. weeks , with contributions from many others .",
    "more precisely , the isomorphism signatures were entered into ` snappy ` , which identified all still unrecognized manifolds , except three , as hyperbolic manifolds in its census ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "for the census in ( c ) , we used a catalogue of links ( up to @xmath12 crossings ) included in ` snappy ` and in some cases the recognized structure of graph manifolds .",
    "it turned out that all @xmath0-manifolds in our census except two were complements of links in the @xmath0-sphere ( see table  3 ) . for each manifold of this kind",
    "we also displayed the diagram of a corresponding link ( see figures  [ links1 ] and [ links2 ] ) .",
    "when more than one link was available a prime one was preferred ( identified by its name in the hoste - thistlethwaite table ) .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite graph which is @xmath1-regular ( i.e. , each vertex has degree four ) , possibly with multiple edges but with no loops .",
    "a map @xmath13 is called a _ @xmath1-coloration _ of @xmath10 if adjacent edges have different colors .",
    "an edge of @xmath10 colored by @xmath14 is also called a _ @xmath15-edge_.    a _ @xmath1-colored graph _ is a connected @xmath1-regular graph equipped with a @xmath1-coloration .",
    "it is easy to see that any @xmath1-colored graph has even order . if @xmath16 , a _ @xmath17-residue _ ( as well as a _ @xmath18-residue _ ) of @xmath10 is any connected component of the subgraph @xmath19 of @xmath10 containing exactly all @xmath15-edges , for each @xmath20",
    "of course , @xmath21-residues are vertices , @xmath22-residues are edges and @xmath4-residues are bicolored cycles . for each @xmath14 , we denote by @xmath23 the number of @xmath0-residues corresponding to the colors of @xmath24 .    a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 induces a compact connected @xmath0-manifold @xmath11 without spherical boundary components via the following construction .    by attaching a disk to each @xmath4-residue of @xmath10 ( considered as a @xmath22-dimensional cellular complex )",
    "we obtain a @xmath4-dimensional polyhedron @xmath25 .",
    "each @xmath0-residue of @xmath10 , with its associated disks , forms a closed connected surface @xmath26 embedded in @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 is a @xmath4-sphere the residue is called _ ordinary _ , otherwise it is called _",
    "singular_.    then , for any @xmath0-residue @xmath26 , fill it with a @xmath0-ball if it is ordinary , and just thicken it by attaching @xmath27 along @xmath28 if it is singular . at the end of this process ,",
    "a compact connected @xmath0-manifold @xmath11 with non - spherical boundary components is obtained .",
    "we will say that @xmath10 _ represents _ @xmath11 , as well as that @xmath11 is _ associated _ to @xmath10 .",
    "obviously isomorphic @xmath1-colored graphs - colored graphs @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with coloration @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , are isomorphic if there exist a graph isomorphism @xmath33 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 and a permutation @xmath34 of @xmath35 such that @xmath36 . ]",
    "represent homeomorphic @xmath0-manifolds .    for closed @xmath0-manifolds",
    "the construction reduces to the one introduced by lins ( see @xcite ) , and it is dual to the one introduced by pezzana ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so , the novelty of this construction is that it works also in case of @xmath0-manifolds with boundary , and @xmath37 is a surjective map from the whole class of @xmath1-colored graphs to the whole class of compact @xmath0-manifolds with ( possibly empty ) boundary without spherical components .",
    "in fact , the following result is proved in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath38 is a compact @xmath0-manifold with ( possibly empty ) boundary without spherical components , then there exists a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 such that @xmath38 is homeomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is orientable if and only if @xmath39 is bipartite .",
    "since two compact @xmath0-manifolds are homeomorphic if and only if ( i ) they have the same number of spherical boundary components and ( ii ) they are homeomorphic after capping off by balls these components , there is no loss of generality in studying compact @xmath0-manifolds without spherical boundary components . in the following with the term `` manifold",
    "'' we will always refer to such type of @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "-colored graphs @xmath40 and and @xmath41 , representing the genus one orientable and non - orientable handlebody respectively . ]    in @xcite , @xmath1-colored graphs representing important families of compact @xmath0-manifolds , such as handlebodies ( both orientable and non - orientable ) , and @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is any closed surface ( either orientable or non - orientable ) are shown .",
    "as usually happens in any representation technique of @xmath0-manifolds ( triangulations , spines , branched coverings , surgery on links , etc ... ) , any compact @xmath0-manifold admits representation by infinitely many @xmath1-colored graphs .",
    "so , moves connecting non - isomorphic graphs representing the same @xmath0-manifolds are important tools in the theory .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be adjacent vertices of a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 of order @xmath44 , and let @xmath45 be the subgraph of @xmath10 consisting of @xmath46 and all the @xmath47 edges connecting them .",
    "then @xmath45 is called an _ @xmath47-dipole _ if @xmath43 and @xmath48 belong to different @xmath49-residues of @xmath10 , where @xmath50 are the colors of the @xmath47 edges of @xmath45 .    by _ cancelling _",
    "@xmath45 _ from _ @xmath10 , we mean to remove @xmath45 and to paste together the hanging edges according to their colors , thus obtaining a new @xmath1-colored graph @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , @xmath10 is said to be obtained from @xmath51 by _ adding _ @xmath45 .",
    "an @xmath47-dipole @xmath45 is called _ proper _ when @xmath10 and @xmath51 represent the same manifold .",
    "[ proper ] @xcite an @xmath47-dipole @xmath45 in a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 is proper if and only if one of the following conditions holds :    * @xmath52 ; * @xmath53 and at least one of the @xmath54-residues containing the two vertices of @xmath45 is ordinary .    in the closed case",
    "all dipoles are proper and casali proved in that dipole moves are sufficient to connect different @xmath1-colored graphs representing the same manifold .",
    "a similar fact is no longer true in our context ; in fact dipole moves do not change the singular colors - colored graph @xmath10 , we mean a color @xmath14 such that at least one of the @xmath55-residues of @xmath10 is singular . ] of the involved graph , and for any @xmath0-manifold with disconnected boundary it is easy to find two different graphs representing it , the first one with only a singular color and the second one with ( at least ) two singular colors .",
    "a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 is said to be _ contracted _ if either @xmath56 or all @xmath55-residues of @xmath10 are singular , for each @xmath14 . note that a @xmath1-colored graph is contracted if and only if it does not contain any proper @xmath22-dipole , and a contracted @xmath1-colored graph contains no @xmath0-dipoles .",
    "moreover , by cancelling proper @xmath22-dipoles , any @xmath1-colored graph can be reduced to a contracted one representing the same manifold .",
    "so , any compact @xmath0-manifold admits representation by contracted @xmath1-colored graphs .    a @xmath1-colored graph @xmath10 is called _ minimal _ if there exists no graph with less vertices representing the same manifold .",
    "of course , a graph containing a proper dipole is not minimal . in particular ,",
    "any minimal graph is contracted .",
    "the combinatorial nature of colored graphs makes them particularly suitable for computer manipulation .",
    "in particular , it is possible to generate catalogues of @xmath1-colored graphs for increasing number of vertices , in order to analyze the represented compact @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we focus our attention to @xmath0-manifolds with non - empty boundary , since the catalogation of graphs associated to closed manifolds ( also called _ gems _ , and _ crystallizations _ in the contracted case ) , has been already performed up to 30 vertices ( see and @xcite ) .      by the results of section  [ sec2 ] , without loss of generality we can restrict the catalogues to contracted graphs with no @xmath4-dipoles .",
    "therefore , given a positive integer @xmath6 , the catalogue of contracted @xmath1-colored graphs with @xmath7 vertices and no @xmath4-dipoles is generated algorithmically in the following way .",
    "first of all consider the set of all ( possibly disconnected ) @xmath4-colored graphs ( i.e. , disjoint union of @xmath57-colored cycles ) with @xmath7 vertices . for",
    "any element of this set , add the @xmath4-edges in all possible way in order to obtain , by checking bipartition and computing the euler characteristic of the connected components , the set @xmath58 of all ( possibly disconnected ) @xmath0-colored graphs @xmath10 with @xmath7 vertices , such that each connected component of @xmath10 represents a surface of positive genus .",
    "for the values of @xmath6 from @xmath22 to @xmath59 , the cardinality of @xmath58 is @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "afterwards , the @xmath0-edges are added to each graph of @xmath58 in all possible ways giving rise to a contracted @xmath1-colored graph without @xmath4-dipoles .    in order to avoid the presence of isomorphic graphs in the catalogue",
    ", the concept of code of a @xmath1-colored graph is an useful tool .",
    "the _ code _ of a @xmath62-bipartite @xmath1-colored graph - colored graph @xmath10 is called @xmath62-bipartite , if @xmath62 is the largest integer such that all @xmath62-residues of @xmath10 are bipartite . ]",
    "@xmath10 with @xmath7 vertices is a `` string '' of length @xmath63 , which completely describes both combinatorial structure and coloration of @xmath10 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the importance of the code for representing @xmath1-colored graphs relies on the fact that two @xmath1-colored graphs are isomorphic if and only if they have the same code . as a consequence , by using codes we can produce catalogues containing only graphs which are pairwise non - isomorphic .",
    "table  1 shows the number of non - isomorphic contracted @xmath1-colored graphs without @xmath4-dipoles and inducing manifolds with non - empty boundary , where @xmath64 ( resp .",
    "@xmath65 ) refers to bipartite ( resp .",
    "non - bipartite ) graphs of order @xmath7 , with @xmath66 .",
    "with regard to the classification of the manifolds represented by the above graphs , some results concerning cases with small number of vertices have been already established :    as it is clear from table  1 , the number of generated graphs quickly increases with the number of vertices and becomes very large even in the initial segment of the catalogues .",
    "so we carried on our research taking care of the cases with ( possibly disconnected ) toric boundary , which includes the important cases of complements of knots or links in the @xmath0-sphere . in this context ,",
    "orientable manifolds are of particular interest .",
    "notice that the five orientable manifolds of the previous proposition are in fact knot / link complements .",
    "namely , the two manifolds represented by graphs with six vertices are the complements of the trivial knot and the hopf link respectively , whereas the three manifolds represented by graphs with eight vertices are the complements of the links l6n1 , l8n8 and l8n7 respectively ( see table  3 and figure  [ links1 ] ) , according to the notation of thistlethwaite link table .    at the end of this section , table  2 lists in the first two rows the number of non - isomorphic bipartite contracted @xmath1-colored graphs without @xmath4-dipoles representing manifolds with toric boundary , indicated by @xmath67 and the special cases of connected toric boundary , indicated by @xmath68 .      when a @xmath1-colored graph is bipartite , special configurations of its edges gives some information about the minimality of the graph and the reducibility of the associated orientable manifold .    a",

    "the _ switching _ of a @xmath69-pair @xmath71 is the operation of replacing the edges of the pair , by two new edges @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the same color as the old ones , connecting the endpoints of @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the only way which preserves the bipartition of @xmath10 ( see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] for the case @xmath77 ) . each @xmath4-residue shared by the two edges of the pair splits into two cycles and the new bipartite @xmath1-colored graph @xmath29 obtained after the switching may be either connected or disconnected with two components . in particular , when @xmath78 the new graph @xmath29 is always connected .",

    "the definition relies on the following lemma which extends to manifolds with non - empty boundary the corresponding result established by lins for the closed case ( @xcite ) :    [ rho2 ] let @xmath10 be a bipartite @xmath1-colored graph with a @xmath79-pair , and denote by @xmath29 the @xmath1-colored graph obtained from @xmath10 by switching the pair .",

    "the @xmath81-residue involved in the switching , considered with its associated disks , is a closed orientable surface @xmath26 .",

    ", @xmath29 is not contracted since it has at least two @xmath81-residues which are not both singular . as a consequence , @xmath29 is not minimal and therefore @xmath10 is not minimal too , since it has the same order as @xmath29 .",
