    "among the continuous variable ( cv ) entangled states @xcite , non gaussian states are generally believed to possess much more robust entanglement vis a vis the gaussian states states characterized by a gaussian quasi probability distributions and hence by their first and second moments .",
    "though mathematically not as well understood as the gaussian states @xcite in so far as their entanglement properties are concerned , non gaussian states , by virtue of the robustness of their entanglement have in recent years emerged as strong contenders for potential applications in quantum information technology .",
    "the fact that the non gaussian states are defined by what they are not makes a general discussion of their entanglement properties impossible and one is forced to restrict oneself to sub families of non gaussian states such as states obtained by adding or subtracting a fixed number of photons to gaussian states @xcite and forming suitable superpositions thereof .",
    "one such widely discussed family of non gaussian states parameterized by an integer @xmath0 is the family of noon states @xcite    @xmath1.\\ ] ]    these states , similar in structure to the epr states , have attracted much attention in recent years and can be viewed as a two mode state consisting of a superposition of states containing @xmath0 photons in one mode and none in the other and vice versa .",
    "schemes for reliable production of such states have been proposed @xcite and their usefulness as a practical tool in making super - precision measurements in optical interferometry , atomic spectroscopy and in sensing extremely small magnetic fields than hitherto possible have been highlighted @xcite .",
    "this circumstance makes it imperative to investigate their behavior under attenuation and amplification . while studies on the decoherence effects on noon states under specific models for system - bath interactions already exist in the literature @xcite , in the present work we focus on the question of amplification of noon states and the consequent degradation of entanglement therein and to compare and contrast it with the behavior of entanglement in gaussian states under amplification investigated in @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the amplification of noon states as quantum communication protocols would use both amplifiers and attenuators @xcite . in the present work we consider only phase insensitive amplification and model this in the standard way as a bath consisting of @xmath0 two level atoms of which @xmath2 are in the excited state and @xmath3 in the ground state with @xmath4 . under the assumptions that atomic transitions have a large width and that the bath is maintained in a steady state",
    ", the time evolution of the density operator @xmath5 for a single mode of radiation field on resonance with the atomic transition is described , in the interaction picture , by the master equation    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode .",
    "a brief outline of this work is as follows . in section",
    "ii , with the noon state as the input to the amplifier , we obtain expressions for the output density operator for the case when both the modes are symmetrically amplified and for the case when only one mode is subjected to amplification and the other is not amplified at all .",
    "we investigate how the entanglement in the output state varies with the amplifier gain using logarithmic negativity as the quantifier for entanglement @xcite .",
    "section iii contains our concluding remarks and further outlook .",
    "our study complements the work done by vitelli et al @xcite on amplification of noon state by a phase sensitive amplifier .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite , we found that for a two mode squeezed vacuum as the input , there are limits on the gain beyond which the output of the amplifier has no entanglement between the two modes and the limiting values of the gain in the two cases considered , symmetric and asymmetric amplification , were found to be    @xmath9    where the gain @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in particular , when @xmath12 , the limiting gain in the symmetric case remains finite , that for the asymmetric case the limiting value moves off to infinity @xcite .    in this section",
    "we discuss how an input noon state evolves under the action of a phase insensitive amplifier as modeled by the master equation @xmath13 confining ourselves for simplicity to the @xmath12 limit .",
    "the solution of master equation ( 2 ) can be written in terms of the fock state matrix elements .",
    "however such a solution is rather involved @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to work in terms of phase space distributions .",
    "a distribution which is especially useful is the q function introduced by kano ; sudarshan and mehta @xcite .",
    "this function is defined by    @xmath14    the master equation ( 2 ) for @xmath15 then leads to    @xmath16    note that this differential equation for @xmath17 function involves only the first order derivatives with respect to phase space variables and hence its solution is simple @xcite    @xmath18    let us see what the result @xmath19 means .",
    "let us consider the input state to be vacuum then the output would be    @xmath20    such an output @xmath17 function is equivalent to a thermal density matrix with mean number of photons equal to @xmath21 .",
    "thus the vacuum state on amplification becomes a thermal state with a mean number of photons that grows with the gain of the amplifier .",
    "we note that a result like ( 6 ) extends to multi - mode case .",
    "we now examine two cases , the symmetric case in which both the modes @xmath7 and @xmath22 in the input noon state are symmetrically amplified and the asymmetric case in which only one mode , say @xmath7 , is amplified . before discussing the amplification of the noon state",
    "we examine quantitatively the entanglement in the state ( 1 ) .",
    "we compute the log negativity parameter which is defined as    @xmath23    where @xmath0 is the absolute value of the sum of all the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the partial transpose of the density matrix associated with the state ( 1 ) is    @xmath24~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which can be written in the diagonal form as    @xmath25    the partial transpose has a negative eigenvalue @xmath26 and hence the logarithmic negativity parameter @xmath27 .",
    "_ symmetric case _ : the @xmath17- function corresponding to the density operator for the input noon state    @xmath28\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2n!}[a^{\\dagger n}\\rho_0a^n+a^{\\dagger n}\\rho_0b^n+b^{\\dagger n } \\rho_0a^n + b^{\\dagger n}\\rho_0b^n],\\nonumber\\\\~~ \\rho_0 & = & |0,0><0,0|~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is found to be    @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following the prescription in @xmath19 , under symmetric phase insensitive amplification , the q - function evolves as follows :    @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the noon state is highly nonclassical . a quantitative measure for nonclassicality",
    "is obtained by examining zeroes of the @xmath17 function @xcite .",
    "we note that the zeroes of the function @xmath31 are identical to the zeroes of the function @xmath32 and hence we have the remarkable result that the nonclassical character of the input noon state is preserved .",
    "we can now find the density matrix after amplification by using the results ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) :    @xmath33,\\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_{g}&=&\\frac{1}{g^4}e^{-\\beta(a^\\dagger a+b^\\dagger b)},\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\~\\beta & = & { \\rm ln}\\left(\\frac{g^2}{g^2 - 1}\\right ) .",
    "\\label{density}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that the structure of ( [ density ] ) is such that it can not be written in a separable form .",
    "this is seen more clearly if we write ( [ density ] ) as    @xmath34    we further note that the output state has the structure of a two mode photon added thermal state in which either mode has added photons . the single mode version of photon added thermal state was introduced by agarwal and tara @xcite .",
    "these states have been experimentally studied recently @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath35 in the number state basis as    @xmath36    we have    @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which immediately gives us the expression for the operator @xmath38 obtained by partially transposing @xmath39 ( with respect to the b mode ) :    @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2n!g^{2n}}[a^{\\dagger",
    "n}\\rho_{g}a^n+b^{\\dagger n}\\rho_{g}b^n \\nonumber\\\\ & & + a^{\\dagger n}b^{\\dagger n } \\rho_{g}+\\rho_{g}a^n b^n]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the object of interest now is to calculate the logarithmic negativity @xmath41 , the sum of the logarithmic negativity eigen - values of @xmath38 and to see how it varies as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "we carry out this task numerically and the results are displayed in fig . 1 where we plot @xmath41 as a function of @xmath42 for @xmath43 and 6 .",
    "_ asymmetric case _",
    ": proceeding as above , one finds that    @xmath44\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and hence    @xmath45\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{\\rho } & = & \\frac{1}{g^2}e^{-\\beta(a^\\dagger a)}|0><0|;~\\beta={\\rm ln}\\left(\\frac{g^2}{g^2 - 1}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    writing @xmath46 as    @xmath47    we can write @xmath39 in terms of number states as    @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and hence    @xmath49\\label{b}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2n!g^{2n}}[a^{\\dagger n}\\tilde{\\rho}a^n+g^{2n}b^{\\dagger n}\\tilde{\\rho}b^n\\nonumber\\\\ & & + g^n a^{\\dagger n}b^{\\dagger n } \\tilde{\\rho}+g^n \\tilde{\\rho}a^n b^n]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the logarithmic negativity of @xmath38 is computed numerically and the results are shown in fig . 2 for @xmath50 .",
    "clearly in the asymmetric case the loss of entanglement is much slower .",
    "finally we compare the amplification of the noon state with that of photon added two mode squeezed vacuum state i.e. the state ( for brevity the normalization factors are ignored )    @xmath51    this is a non gaussian state .",
    "the input and output @xmath17 functions are found to be    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the @xmath17 function for the two mode squeezed vacuum and @xmath55 is the @xmath17 function obtained by amplification of the squeezed vacuum .",
    "thus the density operator after amplification of the non gaussian state can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the density operator for the squeezed vacuum after amplification .",
    "now @xmath57 becomes separable for @xmath58 greater than that given by ( 3 ) and hence @xmath39 becomes separable if @xmath59 .",
    "thus the non gaussian states obtained from gaussian states by the addition of photons would behave under symmetric amplification in a manner similar to gaussian states .",
    "we have therefore found that the noon states behave quite differently under amplification .",
    "in conclusion we have found that the noon states are more robust under amplification than their gaussian counter parts such as two mode squeezed vacuum produced by a down converter .",
    "we have presented results for the logarithmic negativity as a function of the gain of the amplifier .",
    "we have presented numerical results for cases of states which already have been realized experimentally .",
    "we also found that the noon state does better than say photon added two mode squeezed vacuum state .",
