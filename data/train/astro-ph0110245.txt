    "when photometric properties of star clusters are compared to the predictions of population synthesis models , it is common to find that the scatter among the observed colors and the difference between these colors and the model predictions , are larger than allowed by the observational errors .",
    "this is particularly true for intermediate age clusters in optical - ir colors , like @xmath0 , but to a lesser extent the scatter is also large in @xmath1 .",
    "fig 1 illustrates this point .    in a recent paper , maraston et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the population synthesis models of maraston ( 1998 ) reproduce quite well the @xmath0 colors of the cluster population observed in ngc 7252 at an age between 400 and 600 myr . in these models , built on the fuel consumption theorem ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 )",
    ", the contribution of agb stars to the bolometric light in the synthetic population has been increased over that expected from stellar evolution theory , in such a way as to reproduce the empirical values determined by frogel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for a sample of lmc clusters as a function of swb class . even though this is a valid procedure , in this paper",
    "i show that the optical and optical - ir colors of the intermediate age clusters of the lmc and ngc 7252 are consistent with the colors expected from models ( bruzual & charlot 2001 ; bruzual 2000 , 2001 ) based on current stellar evolution theory , if stochastic fluctuations in the number of stars in sparsely populated evolutionary stages are properly included into the models . in",
    "what follows i use the montecarlo technique pioneered by barbaro & bertelli ( 1977 ) , chiosi et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , girardi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , santos & frogel ( 1997 ) , and cervio , luridiana & castander ( 2000 ) , to study the role that stochastic effects on the initial mass function ( imf ) have on star cluster colors .",
    "i follow the santos & frogel ( 1997 ) approach to study the lmc and ngc 7252 cluster samples .",
    "the derivation below follows closely santos & frogel ( 1997 ) .",
    "the imf @xmath2 normalized as usual , @xmath3 obeys , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 @xmath6 can be interpreted as a probability distribution function which gives the probability that a random mass @xmath7 is in the range between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath6 can be transformed into another probability distribution function @xmath10 , such that the probability of occurrence of the random variable @xmath11 within @xmath12 and the probability of occurrence of the random variable @xmath7 within @xmath13 is the same , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a single - valued function of @xmath8 . from ( 1 )",
    ", @xmath16 is a cumulative distribution function which gives the probability that the mass @xmath7 is less or equal to @xmath8 , and using ( 4 ) , it follows that @xmath17 @xmath10 is thus a uniform distribution for which any value is equally likely in the interval @xmath18 . if we sample @xmath15 using a random number generator ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) , from ( 5 ) we can obtain @xmath8 as a function of @xmath15 , @xmath19^{- { 1 \\over x } } .\\ ] ] for each star of mass @xmath8 generated in this way , we obtain its observational properties from the log @xmath20 and log @xmath21 corresponding to this mass in the isochrone at the age of interest .",
    "we repeat the procedure until the cluster mass , i.e. the sum of @xmath8 for all the stars generated , including dead stars , reaches the desired value . adding the contribution of each star to the flux in different photometric bands , we obtain the cluster magnitude and colors in these bands . throughout this paper",
    "i use @xmath22 ( salpeter 1955 ) , and for the lower and upper mass limits of star formation , i assume @xmath23 and @xmath24 m@xmath25 , respectively .",
    "figs 2 to 6 show the results of the montecarlo simulations . for reasons of space",
    "the details of each figure given in the caption are not repeated in the text . from figs 2 and 3",
    "it is apparent that the fluctuations in the colors become larger as the cluster mass decreases .",
    "the number of stars in the @xmath26 m@xmath25 cluster may be unrealistically small , and some evolutionary stages are not sampled .",
    "there are not enough high mass ms stars in the @xmath26 m@xmath25 and @xmath27 m@xmath25 clusters to make them as blue in @xmath28 at early ages as the model computed with the analytical imf ( equivalent to infinite number of stars ) . in the @xmath29 m@xmath25 case the upper ms",
    "is well sampled and both models are equally blue in @xmath28 .",
    "fig 3 shows that the lower mass cluster models at early ages are bluer in @xmath0 than the analytic model because the lower ms is over populated with respect to the short lived phases with redden this color . for the @xmath29 m@xmath25 cluster",
    "the agreement is good at early ages .",
    "the expected fluctuations in @xmath0 for a @xmath27 m@xmath25 cluster amount to almost 2 magnitudes , in close agreement with the range of colors observed at a given age , and is considerably broader than for the @xmath27 m@xmath25 case .",
    "fig 4 shows an enlargement of the diagrams for the @xmath27 m@xmath25 star cluster . at the intermediate ages the models are redder in @xmath0 than the analytic imf model because of a larger number of agb stars , which appear naturally as a consequence of stochastic fluctuations in the imf .",
    "the regions in these planes occupied by the observations and the cluster simulations overlap quite well .",
    "this comparison seems to favor a not very large mass for these clusters , if stochastic fluctuations are responsible of the color variations .",
    "this conclusion is supported by fig 5 in which i plot @xmath30 vs @xmath0 at the distance of the lmc .",
    "the region covered by the @xmath27 m@xmath25 clusters matches the region covered by the observations very well .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath29 m@xmath25 clusters , which show a much lower dispersion in color for the same @xmath30 magnitude than the observations and the lower mass simulations .",
    "even though the montecarlo technique used in this paper has been used successfully before to explain cluster colors , i have revisited it in this paper to show that there is no need to introduce ad - hoc assumptions into population synthesis models ( maraston 1998 , maraston et a. 2001 ) , which represent a departure from our current understanding of stellar evolution theory , in order to explain the observed range of values of cluster colors and magnitudes . in this paper",
    "i have briefly summarized the results of simple simulations which show clearly how the range of colors observed in intermediate age star clusters can be understood on the basis of current stellar evolution theory , if we take into account properly the expected variation in the number of stars occupying sparsely populated evolutionary stages due to stochastic fluctuations in the imf .    our preliminary conclusion that cluster masses in the range around @xmath27 m@xmath25 are preferred , as well as the dependence on this mass of the fluctuations in magnitude and colors will be explored in detail by bruzual & charlot ( 2001 ) .",
    "the interested reader may request results for other quantities equally sensitive to stochastic fluctuations , like the number of ionizing photons from a young stellar population , not shown here for lack of space ( see also cervio , luridiana & castander 2000 ) .",
