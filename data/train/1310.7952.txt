    "this kind of characterization is crucial for constraining the bulk compositions of these planets , as the presence of a thick atmosphere leads to degeneracies in models of their interior structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these observations were obtained using the infra - red array camera ( irac ) in the 4.5 @xmath0 m channel operated in sub - array mode ; additional details are shown in table 2 .",
    "there is a known instrumental effect during _",
    "observations that consists of a ramp up in pixel sensitivity with time , usually occurring up to an hour in duration at the start of an observation .",
    "we therefore padded our light curves with additional time before the predicted center of transit in case it was necessary to trim the initial data affected by the ramp , as is standard practice in _ spitzer _ analyses .",
    "this results in a slightly off - center observation window for each of our targets with regards to their predicted centers of transit .    in all data sets ,",
    "we extract flux information from the bcd files provided by the _",
    "spitzer _ pipeline .",
    "we calculate the flux using techniques described in several previous studies @xcite .",
    "first , we find the center of the stellar point spread function using a flux - weighted centroiding routine , then we perform aperture photometry , testing both fixed and time variable aperture sizes .",
    "the fixed aperture radii we tested ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 pixel widths , in steps of 0.1 ; the time variable apertures were scaled based on the noise pixel parameter @xcite .",
    "the noise pixel parameter is proportional to the square of the full width half max of the stellar point spread function , and described by equation 1 below :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the measured intensity of the @xmath98 pixel .",
    "we then empirically re - scale the noise pixel aperture radii either as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a scaling factor between 0.8 and 1.7 pixel widths , in steps of 0.1 ; or alternatively as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a constant between -0.2 and 1.0 pixel widths , also in steps of 0.1 .",
    "we account for variations in intrapixel sensitivity by adopting a nearest neighbor weighting algorithm , such that the flux at each time step is normalized by a weighted sum of its 50 nearest neighbors in x and y space on the pixel array , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then evaluate each of the aperture radius models to find the lowest resulting scatter in the residuals of the fitted light curve .",
    "although the best fit aperture radius varied depending on target , in each case an adjustment based on noise pixel yielded improvements over fixed aperture photometry ; however , both methods resulted in null transit detections .",
    "the median best fit aperture radius for each light curve is shown in table 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the raw flux photometry for each observation .",
    "figure 2 shows the corresponding normalized flux photometry after utilizing the nearest neighbor algorithm .",
    "we fix the orbital parameters for each planet to the values obtained from the radial velocity measurements , and only the time of transit center , the planet radius , and the impact parameter are varied in the fits .",
    "the forward model for a transit @xcite takes as input these three transit parameters , as well as the orbital period and planet semi - major axis from rv measurements , and limb darkening coefficients based on each target s stellar parameters @xcite .",
    "characterization of transit parameter posterior likelihoods is carried out using a pseudo - grid search method : given a fixed impact parameter and transit center time , a best fit planet radius is found by levenberg - marquardt chi - squared minimization .",
    "planet radius is effectively allowed to be ` negative ' in these fits by calculating a transit light curve using the absolute value of the planet radius , then inverting the curve for negative radius values .",
    "this is done in order not to bias the fits and to better characterize the noise level of the observations .",
    "figure 3 shows histograms of planetary radii for a fixed impact parameter of zero ( an equatorial transit ) , and fixed transit center times that are stepped across the window of observation in increments of approximately 30 seconds .",
    "this effectively finds the best fit planet radius at each location in the light curve .",
    "as no significant transits are detected in any of the light curves , these histograms characterize the magnitude of the combined gaussian ( white ) and time correlated ( red ) noise , and therefore provide empirical thresholds for detection of possible transits .",
    "2@xmath103 limits are calculated that encompass 95% of the histogram ( i.e. , 47.5% of the distribution lies above the median and below the upper limit , 47.5% below the median and above the lower limit ) .",
    "the 2@xmath103 limits corresponding to positive planetary radii are then taken as thresholds for transit detection , as negative radii are non - physical solutions .",
    "these 2@xmath103 thresholds are shown in table 3 , along with values of planet radii corresponding to models with 100%  fe , 100%  mgsio@xmath104 , and 100%  h@xmath105o bulk composition @xcite , derived using the planet minimum masses found from rv measurements .",
    "although we expect that a pure iron planet would be very unlikely based on current planet formation models , this limiting case allows us to place a strict lower limit on the range of possible radii for our target planets .",
    "our estimated radii also assume that the planets have negligible atmospheres , and the presence of a thick atmosphere would only serve to increase the transit depth for a given interior composition .",
    "in addition to determining transit detection limits , we confirm the validity of these limits by inserting artificial transits with depths above the detection threshold into the data and verifying that we can reliably retrieve them in our fits .",
    "analysis of these artificially inserted transits yielded consistent results for detection thresholds of planetary radii .",
    "in figure 4 we evaluate the sensitivity of our detection limits to changes in the assumed impact parameter @xmath106 .",
    "we find that our limits on planetary radius are fairly insensitive to changes in impact parameter , though this sensitivity varies depending on the target .",
    "the limits for hd  97658 and hd  156668 remain nearly constant out to impact parameters of 0.9 , while the thresholds for the other targets tend to vary more noticeably but still mostly remain below a planet radius of 1@xmath107 .",
    "the unusual behavior of hd  7924 in this case is likely due to a correlated noise feature in the observed light curve of similar duration and depth as a model transit with an impact parameter of around 0.5 and a planet radius of about 1.1@xmath107 .",
    "the relatively short duration of the hd  7924 light curve influences the sensitivity of this impact parameter test to the noise in the data , but note that even in this case , a planet radius of 1.1@xmath107 remains an unphysical solution .",
    "as the 2@xmath103 thresholds for possible transits are in all cases less than the radius of a pure iron core model @xcite , we therefore conclude that transits for all of our targets are conclusively ruled out within the window of our observations .",
    "table 3 shows the posterior likelihood that the planets may still transit outside the _ spitzer _ observation windows . for several cases",
    "the probability of transit has been all but eliminated , while for others we calculate the individual probability of transit remains no higher than 1.4% .",
    "for the case of gj  876  d , a null transit result is in agreement with the initial photometric measurements of @xcite .",
    "however , we note that our non - detection of a transit for hd  97658  b appears on initial inspection to conflict with a recent paper by @xcite announcing the detection of transits with _",
    "most_. we centered our _ spitzer _ transit window using the predicted transit time from the preliminary ground - based transit detection of @xcite .",
    "subsequent follow - up observations by @xcite taken within a month of our _ spitzer _ observations demonstrated that the planet did not transit at the time predicted by henry et al . ; our data provide additional support for this conclusion . a later re - analysis by henry et al .",
    "indicated that the apparent transit detection was caused by an airmass effect in the original observations .",
    "using the updated transit ephemeris from the recent _ most _ detection , we calculate a predicted transit center time of @xmath108 , approximately 13 hours earlier than the _ spitzer _ observation window that started at @xmath109 .",
    "we therefore conclude that our non - detection of a transit for hd  97658  b is consistent with the transit ephemeris reported by @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for transits in any of the systems targeted by this survey .",
    "there remains some probability that a transit occurred outside the observation window for each target ; we know this occurred for hd  97658  b , but the probability is extremely small for our other targets as shown in table 3 . excluding hd  97658  b , we estimate that the cumulative posterior transit probability for these targets is now only 4.0% .",
    "their cumulative prior transit probability before observations was 30.5% ; it is therefore not surprising that no transits were detected , but the high value of such transiting systems more than justifies the investment of _ spitzer",
    "_ time .",
    "although no transits were detected in this work , future prospects of utilizing this method for super - earth discovery remain high . by our estimates",
    "the majority of stars known to host super - earths with well - constrained ephemerides have already been observed by either _ spitzer _ , _ most _ , or both , but we expect that current and next - generation radial velocity surveys will produce an ever - growing number of such systems in the coming years . until the launch of _ tess _",
