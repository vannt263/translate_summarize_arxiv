    "electronic correlations are known to give rise to highly unusual phenomena such as heavy fermion behavior or the mott metal - insulator transitions.@xcite in recent years a new perspective for this field has been provided by various pump - probe spectroscopies , which can directly track the time evolution of strongly interacting systems far from equilibrium .",
    "for example , the dynamics of electrons in the vicinity of a mott metal - insulator transition was investigated using time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and time - resolved optical spectroscopy.@xcite in these experiments , the sample is first excited by an intense laser pulse ( pump ) ; a second pulse ( probe ) , which comes at a controlled time - delay , is then used to characterize the transient state by means of photoemission or optical spectroscopy .",
    "pump - probe experiments with femtosecond time - resolution are now commonly used for the investigation of dynamics in molecules,@xcite metals,@xcite and semiconductors.@xcite recent development of shorter and shorter pulses has pushed the limiting time - resolution below @xmath0  fs for optical frequencies,@xcite and into the attosecond regime for pulses in the extreme ultraviolet.@xcite    for solids it is often a subtle task to distinguish the contribution of various degrees of freedom to a specific phenomenon .",
    "the mott transition is induced by the coulomb repulsion between electrons , but can occur simultaneously with a change of the lattice structure , obscuring the primary origin of the phase transition . in time - resolved experiments , however , different degrees of freedom can be identified if they evolve on different time scales.@xcite in particular , the lattice usually reacts much slower than the electronic system .",
    "many phenomena that are already visible at low time resolution can be explained in terms of a two - temperature model,@xcite which assumes that the electronic system is in thermal equilibrium at any given time , but may have a different temperature than the lattice .",
    "on the other hand , pump - probe experiments allow for an investigation of the electronic real - time dynamics .",
    "for example , two - photon photoemission spectroscopy can monitor the ultrafast thermalization of a pumped electron gas in metals within several @xmath1  fs.@xcite in semiconducting gaas , the buildup of a screened coulomb interaction in the electron - hole plasma created by the photoexcitation of electrons into the conduction band has been tracked using time - domain thz spectroscopy.@xcite in particular the latter experiment probes the true quantum dynamics of the state , which can no longer be described by a simple rate equation but requires the full many - particle hamiltonian.@xcite it would be very interesting to measure the electronic dynamics in strongly interacting systems , which may dominate , e.g. , the ultrafast buildup of intermediate metallic states across insulator - to - metal transitions,@xcite or the melting of correlation - induced long - range order after an external perturbation.@xcite the goal of this paper is to set up the framework for a microscopic description of time - resolved optical measurements in such strongly correlated electron systems . for time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , the microscopic description was recently derived in ref .  .",
    "the microscopic formalism of isolated quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium was given independently by baym and kadanoff,@xcite and keldysh@xcite in terms of real - time green functions .",
    "it provides the starting point for a nonequilibrium perturbation theory,@xcite which is however bound to fail for strong interactions .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft),@xcite which becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimension,@xcite also applies to the non - perturbative regime .",
    "dmft self - consistently maps a lattice model onto an auxiliary single - site problem .",
    "the equilibrium theory has been instrumental in understanding many correlation - induced phenomena , such as the mott transition , both for simple model systems,@xcite and for real materials.@xcite recently , dmft for nonequilibrium has been formulated in the framework of keldysh theory.@xcite it has been used to investigate the falicov - kimball model@xcite under the influence of strong electrical fields,@xcite as well as its relaxation over the metal - insulator transition after a sudden change of the interaction parameter.@xcite similar investigations for the hubbard model still require new techniques for the solution of the effective single - site problem . however , promising candidates for this task have been developed during the last years.@xcite    the main purpose of this paper is to discuss the probe process in optical spectroscopy in terms of linear response of a nonequilibrium state to an electromagnetic field .",
    "for this state , which might originate from the application of a pump pulse , the time evolution is assumed to be known from dmft .",
    "the response is given by the two - time optical conductivity @xmath2 , that relates the current at time @xmath3 to electrical fields in the sample at earlier times @xmath4.@xcite for systems in equilibrium dmft has already been successfully used to understand optical spectroscopy in correlated materials.@xcite the standard expression for the frequency - dependent conductivity @xmath5 in dmft@xcite is quite simple and contains only single - particle green functions , because vertex corrections to the current - current correlation function vanish for isotropic systems.@xcite in this paper we derive an expression for the two - time conductivity @xmath2 from non - equilibrium dmft , which turns out to be a direct generalization of the equilibrium expression@xcite to keldysh language .",
    "in particular , our derivation shows when the inclusion of vertex corrections becomes mandatory in non - equilibrium situations , and under which conditions similar simplification occur for @xmath2 as for @xmath5 .",
    "we then apply the theory to a simple lattice model for interacting electrons in a single band , @xmath6 here @xmath7 are annihilation ( creation ) operators for two species of fermions ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10,@xmath11 ) on lattice site @xmath12 , which interact via a local coulomb repulsion @xmath13 .",
    "the first term in ( [ fkm ] ) is a tight - binding description of the electronic band .",
    "( [ fkm ] ) is the hamiltonian of the defines the hubbard model if the hopping @xmath14 does not depend on the flavor @xmath8 , or the falicov - kimball model@xcite if one particle species is immobile ( @xmath15 @xmath9 @xmath16 ) .",
    "both models have a rich phase diagram as a function of interaction and filling , including metallic , insulation and ordered phases . in the presence of electromagnetic fields [ with scalar and vector potential @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ", the hopping amplitudes acquire peierls phase factors @xcite @xmath19 and a potential term @xmath20 is added to the hamiltonian , where @xmath21 is the charge of an electron .",
    "here and throughout a tilde indicates that the quantity is taken in zero external field .",
    "nonequilibrium dmft can potentially model the full pump - probe process by including the pump field explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ peierls - t ] ) . in the application of the general result to the falicov - kimball model we use an idealized nonequilibrium situation instead ,",
    "where the `` pumping '' is an instantaneous event ; we only have to know the excited state after the pumping , which is taken as initial state for the subsequent time evolution .",
    "this permits an investigation of the relaxation between the various phases .",
    "for instance , we can start from a metallic state and follow the relaxation in the insulating parameter regime of the hamiltonian .",
    "below we model this situation by a sudden increase of the interaction parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we therefore allow for arbitrary time dependence of all parameters @xmath13 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the hamiltonian  ( [ fkm ] ) .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec : pump - probe ] , we define the optical conductivity in nonequilibrium experiments , and discuss its relation to the reflectivity in time - resolved measurements . in section [ sec : dmft ] we shortly review dmft for nonequilibrium .",
    "we then derive the nonequilibrium optical conductivity in dmft in section [ sec : opt - dmft ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : optical - results ] we apply the theory to the falicov - kimball model and investigate the response of the system during the ultrafast buildup of the gapped phase at large interaction .",
    "to understand the results of time - resolved optical spectroscopy it is necessary to know how weak electromagnetic pulses of finite length propagate through the sample , which is not in equilibrium due to the applied pump pulse.@xcite the current @xmath24 is the linear response induced by the probe field , @xmath25 which defines the optical conductivity @xmath26 for samples that are not in equilibrium .",
    "( here and throughout @xmath27 and @xmath28 are cartesian components of the vectors , and repeated indices are summed over . ) note that only the response  ( [ sigma ] ) is linear in the probe field @xmath29 , while arbitrarily strong electric pump fields might be acting on the sample .",
    "the wavelength in optical spectroscopy is typically much larger than the lattice spacing of the sample , so that the linear response relation  ( [ sigma ] ) is essentially local in space . on the other hand",
    "it is not local in time , and unless there is a clear separation between the time scales that govern the electromagnetic response and the relaxation of the nonequilibrium state , @xmath2 depends not only on the difference of its time arguments but on both @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately .",
    "of course @xmath2 is always causal , i.e. , it vanishes for @xmath3 @xmath30 @xmath4 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath2 is sufficient to calculate the reflected and transmitted pulses from maxwell s equations , assuming that the induced current inside the sample is given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma]).@xcite however , the relation to measurable quantities is more complicated than for samples that are in equilibrium . to illustrate we this consider a typical time - resolved reflection experiment , performed at normal incidence , on a sample that is infinite in the @xmath31-@xmath32 plane ( cf .",

    "the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are centered around @xmath45 @xmath9 @xmath16 , and @xmath38 is the probe delay .",
    "for simplicity we assumed cubic symmetry , such that the polarization direction @xmath46 for both pulses is the same .",
    "we then define a generalized reflection coefficient @xmath47,@xcite @xmath48 providing a linear relation between the two pulses .",
    "the full two - dimensional time - dependence of @xmath47 can be deduced from experiment by suitably choosing the pulse , and measuring at all possible pump - probe delays @xmath38 . however , if the optical conductivity @xmath2 depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately , then there is no simple relation to the reflection coefficient @xmath47.@xcite this is evident from the definition  ( [ eref ] ) , which shows that a sample which is not in equilibrium can modulate the pulse frequency .",
    "from now on we use an approximate form for @xmath47 , which is valid for reflection from a very thin slab ( with thickness @xmath49 @xmath33 @xmath16 ) , such that the phase lag between the borders is negligible . in this case",
    "maxwell s equations are easily solved , yielding@xcite @xmath50 a more realistic description , which takes the finite thickness of the sample and its inhomogeneous excited state into account , requires the numerical simulation of the pulse propagation@xcite and of the inverse problem@xcite of obtaining @xmath2 from @xmath47",
