    "various types of wireless devices and networks emerged , wireless communication demands are explosively increasing and becoming diverse for providing an integrated service of voice , data , video , and so on @xcite . in order to support such demands , standard groups for next - generation mobile communication",
    "have actively studied heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) consisting of different types communication systems and devices with different capabilities @xcite . in particular ,",
    "dynamic time division duplex ( d - tdd ) is considered as a promising technology for heterogeneous cellular networks , which dynamically adjusts the portion of uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) frames based on the current communication traffic and environment in a distributed manner by each heterogeneous cell @xcite .",
    "based on the same principle , enhanced interference mitigation and traffic adaptation ( eimta ) has been studied in the 3gpp standard group @xcite .",
    "unlike the conventional cellular networks in which ul and dl phases are synchronized over the entire cells , dynamic adaptation of ul and dl in each cell applied in d - tdd and eimta essentially requires a _ new interference mitigation technique between asynchronous ul and dl cells_. specifically , for a given time slot , ul cells and dl cells may coexist in a network because of asynchronous coordination between cells , which is also referred to as reverse tdd ( r - tdd ) systems . for such r - tdd systems , due to limited capabilities of terminals or users , interference mitigation from the users in ul cells to the users in dl cells",
    "is quite challenging , but crucially important for boosting spectral efficiency . in the context of d - tdd or r - tdd systems , various interference mitigation techniques have been actively studied in the literature , see @xcite and the references therein . for instances , r - tdd techniques has been studied in hetnets to achieve improved area spectral efficiency @xcite or improved throughputs @xcite . to suppress strong interferences from adjacent users , scheduling policies for d -",
    "tdd systems have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the basic principle behind these interference management techniques is to _ avoid strong interferences by orthogonalization and treat weak interferences as noise_.    cadambe and jafar recently made a remarkable progress showing that the sum degrees of freedom ( dof ) of the @xmath0-user interference channel ( ic ) is given by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a new interference mitigation paradigm called _ interference alignment _ ( ia ) has been proposed to achieve @xmath1 dof , which align interfering signals from multiple transmitters into the same signal space .",
    "the concept of this signal space alignment has been successfully adapted to various network environments , e.g. , see @xcite and the the references therein .",
    "different strategies of ia were also developed under the name of ergodic ia @xcite and real ia @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "ia for cellular networks has been studied for both ul and dl scenarios showing that multiple users in each cell are beneficial for improving dof .",
    "more recently , ia techniques using multiple antennas have been actively studied in order to boost dof of multiantenna multiuser networks @xcite . in particular , ia exploiting multiple antennas has been studied in both cellular ul @xcite and dl @xcite .    in spite of the rapid advances on ia studies for the conventional cellular networks in which the entire cells operate either ul or dl @xcite ,",
    "relatively little progress has been made so far on ia for r - tdd systems having the coexistence of ul and dl cells .",
    "one notable work done by jeon and suh is to study ia for two - cell r - tdd systems showing that , depending on the antenna configuration , operating one cell as ul and the other cell as dl can enlarge the sum dof of multiantenna cellular networks than the conventional ul or dl operation @xcite . to achieve such dof gain , asymptotic signal space ia",
    "is needed for aligning multiple interfering signals transmitted from the ul users at each of the dl users , which has to apply transmit beamforming over multiple channel instances @xcite .    in many practical cellular networks ,",
    "however , asymptotic signal space ia is hard to implement due to system complexity and feedback overhead .",
    "furthermore , it requires large enough channel diversity to improve dof , which may cause severe delay when the channel coherence time is large . in order to overcome such limitations , _ single - shot ia using multiple antennas _",
    ", i.e. , multiantenna beamforming using single time instance , has been considered for the @xmath0-user ic @xcite and also for cellular networks @xcite . the feasibility conditions of single - shot ia has been first established in @xcite for the @xmath0-user multiple - input and multiple - output ( mimo ) ic having @xmath2 and @xmath3 antennas at each transmitter and the receiver respectively . followed by @xcite ,",
    "a more general antenna configuration has been considered in @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite established a tighter necessary condition and also the necessary and sufficient condition for a class of network configurations and @xcite provided a sufficient condition for general network configurations . more recently ,",
    "study on ia feasibility has been extended to mimo cellular networks for both ul @xcite and dl @xcite .",
    "ia feasibility conditions have been established in @xcite for various ul settings and in @xcite for mimo cellular networks assuming dl . in spite of recent demand on single - shot ia for r - tdd systems along with its significance to heterogeneous cellular networks ,",
    "the previous work on ia feasibility for mimo cellular networks inherently assumed cellular ul or dl , i.e. , the entire cells operate either ul or dl .    in this paper , we study _",
    "ia feasibility for r - tdd cellular networks having multiple antennas at both base stations ( bss ) and users .",
    "_ we focus on two - cell environment in which one cell operates as ul but the other cell operates as dl , and restrict to linear ia coding scheme without time or symbol extension as the same reasons assumed in @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "* we derive a necessary condition and a sufficient condition on one - shot linear ia for a general mimo antenna configurations .",
    "in several example networks , optimal sum dof is characterized by the established necessary condition and sufficient condition .",
    "we further demonstrate that the proposed ia improves dof than that without ia between ul and dl cells .",
    "* for a symmetric dof in each cell , we establish a sufficient condition on one - shot linear ia with a more compact expression . from the sufficient condition derived with a more compact expression ,",
    "we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for a class of symmetric dof .",
    "* we provide an iterative construction method of precoding and postcoding matrices , which provides a specific beamforming design at finite signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ia not only achieve better dof but also significantly improve the sum rate in the practical snr regime .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : systemmodel ] , we introduce the considered mimo r - tdd cellular network and formally define the ia feasibility problem . in section [ sec : main_results ] , we first state the main results , i.e. , a necessary condition and a sufficient condition established in the paper and provide several example networks for better understanding of the main results .",
