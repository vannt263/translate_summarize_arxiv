    "since the discovery of anderson localization in 1958 @xcite , significant efforts  both analytical and numerical  have been made to understand how localization is affected by interactions . in 2005 ,",
    "basko , aleiner , and altshuler  @xcite demonstrated that , under certain conditions , localization can survive in the presence of interactions .",
    "this phenomenon was called many - body localization ( mbl ) .",
    "the mbl state is a peculiar state of matter characterized by a number of counter - intuitive properties including ergodicity breaking @xcite , and it has been attracting a lot of attention recently ( see , e.g. , refs .  [ ] and references therein ; for reviews , see refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "a different but closely related phenomenon to anderson localization is dynamical localization .",
    "it was first introduced by casati , chirikov , ford , and izrailev @xcite for a prototypical dynamical model of quantum kicked rotor ( qkr)a quantum analog of the classical kicked rotor ( kr ) also known as the chirikov standard map @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it was first observed by moore _",
    "dynamical localization manifests itself in quantum suppression of the chaotic classical diffusion , which for kr occurs in the angular - momentum space when the kicking strength exceeds a critical value .",
    "as opposed to anderson localization in disordered systems , dynamical localization is not related to genuine disorder or intrinsic randomness and is a consequence of deterministic system dynamics .",
    "however , in 1982 fishman _",
    "@xcite showed that the qkr model can be directly mapped onto the anderson model with quasidisorder , and that dynamical localization in qkr corresponds to localization in the anderson - type lattice model .",
    "in particular , in the floquet formalism , the free rotor evolution between the kicks generates a lattice of angular - momentum states ( dimensionless angular momentum is integer due to quantization on a ring ) , and kicking embodies hopping between the `` sites '' of this lattice .",
    "the role of interactions in both anderson and dynamical localization has been studied for a long time . during a few decades",
    ", it was believed that interactions generally destroy localization due to the associated dephasing .",
    "in particular , interactions were studied directly @xcite , and modeled by introducing noise @xcite , dissipation @xcite , and nonlinearity @xcite . some experimental probes",
    "@xcite also tentatively suggested delocalization .",
    "however , in some special cases of two interacting qkrs , dynamical localization was found to be preserved , although weakened  specifically , for a single 2d qkr @xcite and for the interaction potential local in rotor angular - momentum space in 1d @xcite .",
    "although dynamical localization for two coupled qkrs was predicted to disappear in the presence of coordinate - dependent interactions @xcite , in 2007 toloui _",
    "@xcite reported localized regimes in two coupled qkrs .",
    "furthermore , recently keser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that coupled many - body systems can possess dynamical localization , and the corresponding phenomenon was dubbed dynamical many - body localization ( dmbl ) .",
    "however , dmbl has been found only for a specific integrable system of linear quantum kicked rotors ( lqkrs ) so far , and the existence of this phenomenon in more general , nonintegrable cases remains unclear . in this paper",
    ", we propose a nonintegrable model of coupled quantum relativistic kicked rotors ( qrkrs ) .",
    "we explicitly show dynamical localization for up to three coupled rotors ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , and independently of these explicit calculations we argue that the dmbl state in a many - body ensemble of such systems is possible for a wide range of parameters without fine - tuning to integrability .",
    "the many - body lqkr hamiltonian has the form @xmath0 where the single - particle part @xmath1 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ generalhamiltonian ] ) , ( [ single_kicking ] ) , and ( [ single_lqkr ] ) depends on angular momentum linearly as @xmath2 .",
    "and this many - body hamiltonian is a high - angular - momentum limit of the many - body qrkr hamiltonian given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ generalhamiltonian ] ) , ( [ qrkr_freehamiltonian ] ) , and ( [ single_kicking ] ) depends on angular momentum as @xmath5 , since @xmath6 ( parameter definitions are given below ) .",
    "therefore , any possible delocalization stops at sufficiently high angular momenta where this asymptotic dominates . on the other hand , outside of this asymptotic regime , the classical counterpart of the qrkr model exhibits chaotic behavior , and a quantum anderson - type mechanism is necessary to induce localization .",
    "we show that this mechanism also works to some extent in the presence of interactions and conclude that in the general many - body case , localization can result from an interplay of both effects .",
    "apart from the dynamical localization , we also address regimes where the single relativistic kicked rotor exhibits novel transport behavior and examine them in the interacting case .",
    "we find that interactions facilitate this behavior and increase the number of such regimes .",
    "new interesting transport effects can be found if the asymptotic behavior of the dispersion relation at low angular momentum is different from the behavior at high angular momentum . in 2003 , matrasulov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a model of qrkr , a quantum version of a classical relativistic kicked rotor ( rkr ) @xcite .",
    "both rkr and qrkr models naturally possess this dispersion property .",
    "it is important to note that from the viewpoint of the dispersion relation , qrkr interpolates between conventional qkr at low angular momenta and exactly solvable lqkr @xcite at high angular momenta .",
    "recently , zhao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite discovered rich transport properties of rkr and qrkr that included various regimes ranging from localization to superballistic transport .",
    "in general , the transport properties can be classified by the value of the index @xmath7 in the time dependence of the mean - squared generalized `` coordinate . '' for a rotor , the relevant choice is the angular - momentum space : @xmath8 in the case of pure localization @xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 correspond to various types of delocalization .",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to the standard diffusion @xmath12 , while the case @xmath13 is called anomalous diffusion . in particular",
    ", @xmath14 is dubbed subdiffusion and @xmath15 is superdiffusion .",
    "the regime with @xmath16 corresponds to ballistic transport .",
    "there is also a special , less studied case of transient anomalous diffusion called superballistic transport that corresponds to @xmath17 .",
    "only a few examples of this regime are known to date @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both rkr and qrkr exhibit the superballistic transport regime @xcite .    besides the angular - momentum dynamics",
    ", qrkr also naturally possesses a spin - like degree of freedom , and dynamics in this `` spin '' space is quite peculiar ( strictly speaking , it is the particle - antiparticle space of the 1d dirac equation , but we will refer to it as spin for brevity ) .",
    "the first spinful kicked rotor model ",
    "spin-@xmath18 qkr  was suggested by scharf  @xcite and later studied in refs .",
    "[ ] , but the evolution of the spin in either of models did not receive much attention .    in the present paper , first we review the qrkr model and introduce its spin dynamics properties that , to the best of our knowledge , have not been discussed in the literature",
    ". then we numerically demonstrate robust localization upon driving for the model with up to @xmath19 interacting qrkrs .",
    "most importantly , it means that in this model interparticle coupling that corresponds to infinite - range interaction in the respective lattice model does not always destroy few - body localization ( as opposed to the case in refs .",
    "[ ] , but similarly to the one in refs .",
    "more generally , we show that the coupled model inherits the transport regimes of the single qrkr model .",
    "if generalized to a many - body system of qrkrs , this statement results in dmbl similar to that found in ref .",
    "[ ] , but for a nonintegrable system . independently of the numerics , but in agreement with it",
    ", we argue that this is the case because the difference between the dynamics of the many - body qrkrs model and the integrable model considered in ref .",
    "[ ] vanishes as the angular - momentum terms increase and overwhelm the mass terms .",
    "in this section , we review the qrkr model ( see also ref .  [ ] ) and study the spin dynamics and spin - momentum entanglement in this model .",

    "due to the structure of the floquet operators ( [ floquet ] ) and ( [ floquet - two ] ) for single and coupled qrkrs respectively , as well as for any kicked hamiltonian , quantum dynamics is almost invariant with respect to swapping the free and the kicked parts ; i.e. , the hamiltonians @xmath157 and @xmath158 generate the same floquet evolution .",
    "more precisely , in order to get completely the same dynamics , when swapping , one should also change from considering evolution between the moments of time right after the kicks to those just before the kicks and vice versa .",

    ", one could kick the first part of this hamiltonian instead of applying a pulsed lattice .",
    "similar models can be constructed on the basis of the qkr and lqkr models . in particular ,",
    "@xmath165 and @xmath166 correspond to a charged particle in a 1d lattice in the presence of a kicked electric field .",

    "extensions of the single - particle models ( [ qrkr_exp ] )  ( [ lqkr_exp ] ) to the case of many interacting particles can be mapped to corresponding many - body qrkrs , qkrs , or lqkrs in the same way .",
    "hamiltonians ( [ qrkr_exp ] )  ( [ lqkr_exp ] ) might be realized in cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "interestingly , according to the mapping @xmath169 , for such systems , dynamical localization as well as other intriguing transport regimes such as superballistic transport , take place in real space rather than in momentum space , which makes these phenomena especially demonstrative in experiment .",
    "starting with the single - particle qrkr model that possesses the rich variety of transport phases , we introduced its peculiar spin dynamics phenomenology and generalized it to the model of interacting qrkrs .",
    "for the models of two and three coupled qrkrs , we showed that the transport regimes  and , in particular , the localized phase  can survive interactions .",
    "we are not aware of any previous study of coupled qrkrs , but we point out that for the well - studied coupled qkrs and related static lattice models , most works predict delocalization at least for infinite - range interaction .",
    "our calculations indicate the existence of the localized regimes for such a coupling of two and three qrkrs .    unfortunately , exact numerical study of the many - body qrkr model is not feasible presently .",
    "however , at high momenta , it can be approximated by the integrable many - body lqkr model , and this approximation works only better as the system goes to higher momentum states . in ref .  [ ] , the many - body lqkr model was analytically shown to exhibit the dmbl phase .",
    "besides that , as opposed to the case of qkr , the classical model behind qrkr is not chaotic at high momenta .",
    "as we have shown , in the cases of two and three coupled qrkrs , localization has a quantum origin and does not rely on the existence of kam tori in the phase space of the corresponding classical problem .",
    "however , for a large number of interacting rotors , if this localization happens to deteriorate completely , and the growth of the particles momenta recovers , at high enough momenta the system will enter the integrable regime and get localized .",
    "this is our main argument in favor of dmbl in the nonintegrable system of the many - body qrkr model . in general",
    ", the observable dynamical localization can represent a nontrivial interplay of both effects that may be difficult to disentangle . in summary , our argument supplemented by few - body calculations",
    "provide a strong hint that the nonintegrable many - body qrkr model should exhibit dynamically localized many - body states .",
    "in addition , we propose a class of kicked lattice models that map onto various kicked - rotor models and can be realized in the framework of cold atoms in optical lattices .",
