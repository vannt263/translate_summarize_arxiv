    "in 1978 gribov showed that the fixing of the divergence of the gauge field in non - abelian gauge theory does not uniquely fix its gauge .",
    "the restriction of the gauge field such that its faddeev - popov determinant is positive ( gribov region ) is necessary yet insufficient for excluding the ambiguity .",
    "the restriction to the fundamantal modular region , i.e. minimizing the norm of the gauge field , cancels the infrared singularity of the perturbation theory and makes the gluon to have the complex mass .",

    "in order to measure the propagator on a lattice , it is necessary to avoid the gribov copy .",
    "we confirmed that it is possible by the smeared gauge fixing@xcite , when @xmath8 in the case of @xmath12 .",
    "on the lattice we define an @xmath13 lattice action for @xmath14 in the pseudo - fermion scheme .",
    "we measure @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fourier component of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is summed over transverse polarization with respect to * k * .",
    "the gauge field on links is defined as @xmath19 the gauge transformation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a traceless antihermitian    the connected part of the propagator is defined by the normalized fourier transform @xmath23 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 specifies the expectation value of the gauge field in the landau gauge . for this evaluation",
    "it is necessary to fix the global gauge transformation .",
    "we fix the global gauge such that the average over t of the zero - mode of a sample : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the su(3 ) gell - mann matrix , is diagonalized and the smallest eigenvalue appears at the top and the largest eigenvalue at the bottom .",
    "we observed that the 2nd term of @xmath28 is almost independent of t and that the value is several % of the 1st term of @xmath29 .",
    "the value is larger for the unquenched case as compared to the quenched case .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath30 in the unquenched @xmath12 and in the quenched @xmath31 lattice simulation @xcite suggest the suppression of the infrared part of the gluon propagator .    .",

    "in the landau gauge , the transverse gluon propagator in the infrared region is finite at @xmath39 @xciteand the position of the zero of @xmath40 approaches @xmath39 as the lattice size increases , while the propagator of the faddeev - popov ghost which is measured in the quenched @xmath31 lattice shows the infrared singularity .",
