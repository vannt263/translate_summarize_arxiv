    "[ 1 ] during the last decade , the of heavy ion ( hi ) fusion cross - section measurements has been extended to deep sub - barrier energies and in this energy regime the investigation of fusion excitation functions has revealed new phenomenon like fusion hindrance and enhancement .",
    "the signatures of fusion hindrance , the steep fall in fusion excitation function , at deep sub - barrier energies with respect to the standard coupled - channel ( cc ) calculations was firstly observed by jiang and co - workers @xcite at national laboratory , argonne , illinois ( usa ) in the year 2002 . since",
    "then lot of theoretical and experimental work has been done in this low energy domain , which is of great interest not only in the field of nuclear astrophysics , where fusion hindrance can affect the rate of interstellar reactions like : @xmath3c+@xmath3c @xcite , but it also incorporate with the synthesis of super - heavy elements .    in a quest to understand this unexpected behavior , jiang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured and calculated the fusion cross - sections using cc calculations and wong s approximation for the system @xmath4ni+@xmath5y at deep sub - barrier energies , re - analyzed the same for the systems : @xmath6ni+@xmath6ni & @xmath7zr+@xmath8zr and observed fusion hindrance for these systems .",
    "these authors proposed that some properties of fused system , like q - value ( not sufficient alone ) as a possible cause of fusion hindrance .",
    "later jiang _",
    "et al._@xcite , has shown that the fusion hindrance is a general behavior of positive as well as negative q - value systems and reproduced the observed behavior of fusion excitation function by incorporating nuclear incompressibility in cc calculations .",
    "similarly , the fusion hindrance is observed@xcite for open - shell system : @xmath9ni+@xmath9ni w.r.t cc calculations and the observed data is reproduced by including nuclear structure inputs .",
    "further , to explain the fusion hindrance , the double folding potential ( which was too deep for overlapping nuclei ) is supplemented with repulsive core by misicu and esbensen @xcite along with the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction ( @xmath10 ) , called shallow ion - ion potential . in this context , for looking appropriate potentials , different authors have given different reasons , like ichikawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has suggested two - step model of fusion , where the first step is again determined by cc calculations and second step is determined by using one - dimensional adiabatic potential barrier and accounts well for fusion hindrance observed for the systems : @xmath9ni+@xmath9ni & @xmath6ni+@xmath6ni , ichikawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite has extended the standard cc calculations by considering smooth transition from sudden to adiabatic states and explained the fusion hindrance for the systems : @xmath11o+@xmath12pb , @xmath9ni+@xmath9ni & @xmath6ni+@xmath6ni , hagino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite fitted the wood - saxon potential in cc calculations and concluded that the large diffuseness is required to predict low energy behavior of fusion cross - section and brink _ et al . _ @xcite suggested that fusion hindrance may be associated with the overlapping of densities of the two colliding nuclei , where the description of the potential failed , even when cc effects are included .",
    "several other reasons for the fusion hindrance has been given in literature @xcite .",
    "in all the calculations discussed above , the experimental behavior is reproduced by modifying nuclear potential in different ways .",
    "so , it is of great interest to see whether the potentials obtained in skyrme energy density formalism ( sedf ) in semi - classical extended thomas - fermi approach ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and blocki s proximity potential ( proximity77 ) @xcite are capable of explaining this enigmatic behavior of fusion excitation function or not .",
    "as the sedf has ability to provide different - different nuclear proximity potentials for different skyrme forces and is expressed as the sum of two different potentials : ( i ) spin - orbit density dependent ( mainly repulsive ) and ( ii ) spin - orbit density independent ( mainly attractive ) .",
    "since spin - orbit interaction potential is mainly repulsive , which is equivalent to the addition of repulsion to the proximity potential , therefore it will be further interesting to see the effects of this interaction potential in the fusion dynamics for the system : @xmath0al+@xmath1sc , where the fusion cross - section has been measured@xcite at deep sub - barrier energies down to about 300 , because the standard cc calculations failed to reproduce the observed data for this system .",
    "note that the sedf proximity potentials and proximity77 are used in wong s approximation for the calculation of fusion cross - section as a function of center of mass energy .",
    "section 2 describe the methodology for the calculation of interaction potentials , cross - sections , logarithmic derivative , barrier distribution and astrophysical factor . in section 3 ,",
    "calculations and results are discussed and finally section 4 contains the conclusion of the study .",
    "the following sub - sections give the calculations detail for the skyrme interaction potential based upon sedf and proximity77 , fusion cross - section , logarithmic derivative , barrier distribution and finally the astrophysical factor .",
    "the sedf , defines the nuclear interaction potential as a function of inter - nuclear separation @xmath13 as the difference between the energy expectation value _ e _ of the colliding nuclei that are overlapping ( at a finite separation distance @xmath14 ) and are completely separated ( at @xmath15 ) and is given as , @xmath16 where _ e _ = @xmath17 is the energy expectation value . the skyrme hamiltonian density ( see refs .",
