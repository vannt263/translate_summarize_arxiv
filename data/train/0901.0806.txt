    "based on work reviewed and developed in  @xcite and by rendall  @xcite , ringstrm succeeded , some eight , nine years ago , to produce the first major theorem about asymptotic dynamics of type  ix vacuum and orthogonal perfect fluid models  @xcite : the bianchi type  ix attractor theorem , which states that the past asymptotic behavior of generic type  ix solutions is governed by bianchi type  i and  ii vacuum states ( which constitute the mixmaster attractor ) ; see theorem  [ rinthm ] . in this paper",
    "we provide a comparatively short and simple new proof of this theorem .",
    "our proof rests on three cornerstones :    * we introduce new bounded variables that yield a relatively compact state space , which eliminates several of the complications associated with the unbounded variables used by ringstrm . *",
    "we make systematic use of the lie contraction hierarchy of invariant subsets admitted by bianchi type ix where monotone functions restrict the asymptotic dynamics to boundaries of boundaries . *",
    "we systematically employ methods , arguments , and results from the theory of dynamical systems , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .    however , to find a more succinct argument is not our primary motivation to re - investigate bianchi type ix .",
    "our proof demonstrates that bianchi type  ix is special in comparison with the other oscillatory bianchi models , i.e. , type  @xmath0 and type  viii .",
    "this special nature of bianchi type  ix is associated with the geometric condition that the three structure constants have the same sign , which results in an extraordinary simplification of the problem ( which is easily overlooked ) and thus makes the treatment of bianchi type  ix models relatively straightforward .",
    "the fact that bianchi type  ix is rather special has broad ramifications for our understanding of generic spacelike singularities  @xcite : bianchi type  ix is probably not quite as good a role model for the asymptotic behavior of generic inhomogeneous models as is commonly asserted .",
    "ringstrm s bianchi type  ix attractor theorem is a remarkable theorem .",
    "however , it is imperative to point out that this theorem has limited implications , e.g. , nothing is rigorously known about dynamical chaotic properties ( although there are good grounds for beliefs ) .",
    "all claims about chaos in einstein s equations rest on the ( plausible ) belief that the asymptotic dynamics of einstein s equations is reflected by a discrete map ( the kasner map ) , but this is far from evident and has not been proved so far .",
    "these and related issues are discussed in the paper ` mixmaster : fact and belief '  @xcite .",
    "the present paper , however , concentrates on rigorous results .",
    "this paper is essentially self - contained . in section",
    "[ basic ] we begin with a brief discussion of the dynamical systems approach , where we establish the connection with the metric approach .",
    "we briefly introduce hubble - normalized variables , but we concentrate on a set of new bounded variables that yield a relatively compact state space  this is the first cornerstone of our analysis . in section  [ subsets ]",
    "we discuss the levels of the bianchi type  ix lie contraction hierarchy : apart from reviewing results on the bianchi type  i and type  ii subsets , we present a thorough analysis of bianchi type  @xmath1 .",
    "the proofs we give are novel and , in particular , independent of results on bianchi type  ix  this is the second cornerstone of our analysis . in section  [ nongeneric ]",
    "we present the results of the local analysis of the fixed points of the dynamical system and discuss non - generic asymptotically self - similar behavior .",
    "section  [ newproof ] is the core of this paper : we present a new and succinct proof of the bianchi type  ix attractor theorem ( which is stated as theorem  [ rinthm ] ) .",
    "the proof is considerably shorter than the proof given by ringstrm  @xcite ( which is in turn based on results in  @xcite ) . in the proof",
    "we systematically employ methods from the theory of dynamical systems  the third cornerstone of our analysis . in section  [ consequences ]",
    "we state and prove a number of consequences of theorem  [ rinthm ] .",
    "these results follow relatively easily from theorem  [ rinthm ] when combined with the knowledge of the flow on the mixmaster attractor ( which is the union of the type  i and  ii subsets ) .",
    "we conclude in section  [ concl ] with a discussion of the main themes of this paper and we put bianchi type  ix in a broader context ; in particular we emphasize that the present bianchi type  ix models are too special in some respects to serve as good role models for generic spacelike singularities . throughout this paper",

    "<S> the ` bianchi type  ix attractor theorem ' states that the past asymptotic behavior of generic type  ix solutions is governed by bianchi type  i and  ii vacuum states ( mixmaster attractor ) . </S>",
