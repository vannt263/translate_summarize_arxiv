    "recent work to localize the site of the gev emission from blazars using radio - band imaging data has identified a close temporal correlation between activity in the 43 ghz core , a physical region associated with a standing shock @xcite , and flaring in the @xmath0-ray band @xcite , while evidence for enhanced centimeter - band activity during @xmath0-ray flaring has been found for large source samples @xcite .",
    "such results support the notion of a common disturbance for the production of both the radio - band and @xmath0-ray activity and the localization of the @xmath0-ray flaring in the parsec - scale region of the jet during at least some flares , e.g. @xcite .",
    "hence radio - band linear polarization and total flux density data can be used to probe the physical conditions at or near to the @xmath0-ray emission site under the assumption that @xmath0-ray flaring originates in the parsec - scale jet .",
    "the role of shocks in the production of optical - to - radio - band flaring has been widely accepted since the 1980s , and it has been a commonly - cited mechanism for particle acceleration to @xmath0-ray energies in recent work @xcite . however , few detailed studies have been carried out to identify the presence of shocks during @xmath0-ray flares and to determine their role in the production of @xmath0-ray flaring .",
    "comparison of simulated light curves based on radiative transfer calculations incorporating the shock paradigm with radio - band total flux density and linear polarization variability observations can be used to identify the properties of shocks ( strength , orientation , and sense ) and to constrain jet flow conditions .",
    "the latter include the bulk motion of the flow , the viewing angle of the jet , the intrinsic jet opening angle , and the degree of order of the magnetic field . while time - intensive , modeling has the advantage of disentangling complex effects , including relativistic aberration and doppler boosts , and is preferable to indirect methods based on simple assumptions and the combining of unmatched properties .",
    "while useful in obtaining statistical results to delineate parameter space , such procedures can lead to erroneous results for individual sources , in particular where the flow conditions are extreme ( fast ) and the shocks are strong .    the intermediate - spectral - peaked ( isp )",
    "object s5 0716 + 714 is both radio and @xmath0-ray bright , and it has exhibited a history of intense variability across the spectrum , including detection in the tev band , making it well - suited for application of the shock paradigm . to attain this goal , we carried out intensive monitoring of the linear polarization and total flux density with the university of michigan 26-m telescope ( hereafter umrao ) at three frequencies ( 14.5 , 8 , and 4.8 ghz ) during 2008.5 through 2012.5 .",
    "these data , complemented by millimeter vlba imaging data at 43 ghz , which probes structural changes in the inner jet of this highly core - dominated source , are modeled here .",
    "centimeter - band total flux density ( s ) and linear polarization ( lp ) observations of the @xmath0-ray - bright bl lacertae object 0716 + 714 were obtained from the early 1980s through 2012.5 as part of the university of michigan ( umrao ) variability program .",
    "such long - term data are useful for placing the observations during the _ fermi _ era in context .",
    "two - week - averaged long - term total flux density measurements , shown in figure  [ f1 ] , illustrate nearly continuous activity over 3.5 decades of monitoring .",
    "the amplitude of the total flux density exhibited a minimum near 0.3 jy in the mid 1990s during the operation of egret aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "the source was within the egret field of view several times in the 1990s , and 5 detections with @xmath23.5 ( @xmath33@xmath4 determinations ) are listed in the third egret catalog @xcite .",
    "these occurred at viewing periods with midpoints 1992.05 , 1992.19 , 1992.46 , 1993.55 , & 1995.14 .",
    "the peak centimeter - band total flux density amplitudes were considerably lower than those in the _ fermi _ era , and these egret detections occurred during centimeter - band outburst phases which ranged from onset to radio - peak .",
    "the characteristic behavior of the centimeter - band variability is notably different after 2002 .",
    "thereafter high - amplitude , rapid flaring commenced which has been particularly intense and sustained since the launch of _",
    "fermi_.      a blow - up of the umrao total flux density and linear polarization data since mid-2008 and the weekly - binned @xmath0-ray photon flux light curve in the 0.1200 gev band is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the photon fluxes ( panel 1 ) were obtained using * sciencetools*v9r27p1 and p7source_v6 event selection .",
    "the lat data were extracted within a 10@xmath5 region of interest ( roi ) centered upon the position of the target .",
    "these used an unbinned likelihood analysis ( tool gtlike ) to determine the photon fluxes by including in the model all of the sources within 15@xmath1 of the target and by freezing the spectral index of all sources to the value in the 2fgl catalogue .",
    "daily - averaged umrao centimeter - band data are shown in panels 2 - 4 . with the higher sampling attained since the launch of _ fermi _ ,",
    "the individual radio - band flares comprising an outburst are resolved during each activity phase ; sufficient resolution in the data is an important requirement for identifying the number of individual flares within an outburst envelope and is used to set the number of shocks .",
    "the linear polarization is shown in panels 3 and 4 in the form of fractional linear polarization and electric - vector position angle ( evpa ) .",
    "there is a 180@xmath1 ambiguity in the determination of the umrao evpas , and our convention is to restrict the umrao evpa values to lie in the range of 0@xmath1 - 180@xmath1 . in this plot , however , we have allowed the range to be slightly larger to minimize the occurrence of apparent jumps .",
    "vlba imaging data provide important additional constraints in the analysis of the variability in this source .",
    "source - integrated 15 ghz data from the mojave website ( http://www.physics.purdue.edu : orange squares ) and core fluxes obtained from the bu blazar program , vlba - bu - blazar , ( http://www.bu.edu/blazars/vlbaproject.html ) providing monthly data at 43 ghz are included in this figure .",
    "the agreement between the 15 ghz mojave imaging data and the 14.5 ghz source - integrated umrao measurements confirms that there is no significant contribution from extended vla - scale structure to either the total or polarized flux .",
    "the redshift for this source is not known directly from spectroscopic measurements .",
    "however , adopting a value of 0.3 has led to a maximum apparent component speed of @xmath340c based on the analysis of 5 moving mojave components , and a change in the 15 ghz projected inner jet position angle in late 2009-early 2010 is identified from the structural changes with time @xcite . a preliminary analysis of the 43 ghz vlba monitoring data obtained in the boston university blazar program identified complex structural changes in the inner jet region and both stationary and moving jet components ; 3 of the component ejections ( times at which the feature separated from the core ) were temporally - associated with @xmath0-ray flares during the time window presented @xcite",
    ". comparison of the amplitudes and variations in the millimeter and centimeter band gives a measure of the opacity between the respective emission sites and a fiducial location in the jet flow since the 43 ghz ` core ' is associated with a physical feature in the flow .",
    "the fact that both the linear polarization and the total flux density measurements characteristically track at 15 and 43 ghz suggests that either the 43 - 15 ghz emission region is optically thin during this time window , or that the emission sites are spatially close to each other .",
    "cross - correlations of the fluxes from ground - based and satellite instruments at a variety of wavebands have been carried out for segments of the data sets in a number of recent papers , e.g. @xcite , and characteristic time scales identified using structure functions and periodograms @xcite .",
    "this work identifies complex relationships which are overall consistent with the production of flaring by a common disturbance which propagates outward in the jet with time .",
    "the matching of individual total flux density flares in the radio and @xmath0-ray light curves , however , is complicated by the presence of nearly continuous activity in the radio - band in the post - launch time - period , intrinsic difference in the doubling time for flaring in the two bands , and by geometric effects , e.g. @xcite , including changes in jet orientation with time and jet curvature .    -ray and",

    "core fluxes at 43 ghz from the boston university program ( magenta squares ) and source - integrated 15 ghz mojave vlba data ( orange squares ) are included.,width=245 ]",
    "the framework and assumptions adopted in the radiative transfer modeling are detailed in @xcite .",
    "we adopt a scenario in which propagating shocks pass through a region of the jet containing a predominantly - turbulent , passive magnetic field ; the support for the presence of a turbulent magnetic field comes from the umrao result for hundreds of sources showing low levels of fractional polarization ( typically a few percent ) on timescales of decades , and no evidence for the high values ( p@xmath820% ) of the fractional linear polarization in the parsec - scale domain predicted by some models .",
    "such high fractional linear polarizations might be expected for isolated regions of highly - ordered magnetic field , e.g. as found in some jet components from vlbi polarimetry observations , but not in the underlying quiescent flow . while the magnetic field is predominantly turbulent in our model , an additional ordered axial magnetic field component was initially included in the modeling to reproduce the stable evpas observed in umrao sources during the relatively - rare time windows of quiescence , but early modeling revealed that this axial magnetic field can have a significant effect on the simulated light curves and that higher values than the initially - adopted value of 2% in magnetic energy were required to match the data .",
    "the value of the axial magnetic field is one of the parameters determined by the modeling .",
    "the shocks compress the plasma in the emission region , increasing the emissivity and producing an increase in the degree of order of the magnetic field .",
    "the signature of the passage of a shock in the light curves is an outburst in total flux density , an increase in the fractional linear polarization , and an ordered swing in the evpas , and it is the spectral evolution with time in both the linear polarization and the total flux density which constrains our models .",
    "the number of shocks used in the simulation is established from the structure apparent in the total flux density and linear polarization light curves , combined with the expected burst profile for a single shock @xcite .",
    "the shocks are allowed to be oriented at an arbitrary direction relative to the jet flow and are specified by two angles .",
    "the angle @xmath9 , the shock obliquity , specifies the angle relative to the direction of the upstream flow .",
    "a second angle specifies the azimuthal direction of the shock normal , but as discussed in @xcite , the simulation is relatively insensitive to the choice of the value for this free parameter . for simplification",
    "it is assumed that the shock occupies the cross section of the flow and propagates at a constant rate.the attributes which specify a shock are its onset time , length , compression factor , sense ( forward or reverse ) , and orientation .",
