    "although quantum states in field theory may or may not be eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and hence have fixed energy , they are never eigenstates of the energy density or other stress tensor components .",
    "this means that all quantum field theories exhibit fluctuations of the stress tensor .",
    "these fluctuations can manifest themselves either through fluctuating forces on material bodies , or through fluctuations of the gravitational field . in the former category are fluctuations of casimir forces  @xcite and fluctuations of the radiation pressure  @xcite . in this paper , we will be concerned with the latter phenomenon , where stress tensor fluctuations drive fluctuations of the spacetime geometry .",
    "these are `` passive '' fluctuations of the spacetime , in contrast to the `` active '' fluctuations which arise from the quantization of gravity itself .",
    "the role of stress tensor fluctuations in gravity theory has been discussed by several authors  @xcite . among the issues of interest",
    "is the extent to which these fluctuations place limits on the validity of the semiclassical theory of gravity , which is the approximation in which the gravitational field is assumed to be classical and determined by the renormalized expectation value of the stress tensor  @xcite .",
    "other authors have been concerned with the possible role of stress tensor fluctuations in the early universe or upon black hole evaporation  @xcite .",
    "one of the basic problems which must be addressed in treatments of quantum stress tensor fluctuations is that the stress tensor correlation function is singular , even if the stress tensor operator has been renormalized to have finite expectation values .",
    "for this reason , many of the earlier treatments  @xcite studied only a portion of the correlation function which is free of singularities , the `` fully normal ordered part '' .",
    "however , more recently it has become clear that the remaining parts ( the `` vacuum '' and `` cross '' terms to be defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : qstf ] ) can also have physical effects , and that extracting these effects requires a careful procedure for defining integrals with singular integrands  @xcite .",
    "for example , the radiation pressure fluctuations , arising when light in a coherent state impinges upon a mirror , come entirely from the cross term  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present an approach to studying the gravitational effects of stress tensor fluctuations which is based upon raychaudhuri s equation .",
    "this equation relates the ricci tensor to the rate of change of the expansion along a congruence of geodesics , and plays a central role in the proofs of the classical singularity theorems .",
    "we will treat it as a langevin equation which describes how stress tensor fluctuations lead to fluctuations in the expansion .",
    "this in turn leads to a lack of focusing and fluctuations in the luminosity of the images of distant objects seen through a fluctuating spacetime geometry . here",
    "the quantum matter field will be a massless , minimally coupled scalar field on an average background of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec : qstf ] will discuss the stress tensor correlation function and its decomposition into individual terms .",
    "section  [ sec : ricci ] will deal with the ricci tensor correlation function and the fluctuations of the expansion .",
    "the treatment of the singular pieces in the correlation function will also be discussed in this section . in sec .",

    "in this paper , we will deal with the fluctuations of the stress tensor for quantum fields on an average background of minkowski spacetime .",
    "the formal expectation values of @xmath3 are divergent , so we renormalize by subtracting the expectation value in the minkowski vacuum state : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the normal ordered stress tensor operator .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath5 are described by the stress tensor correlation function @xmath6 here the expectation value can be taken in an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "it is of interest to note that this correlation function is unchanged when @xmath5 is shifted by a constant , so we could formally write @xmath7 without normal ordering : @xmath8    although @xmath9 is finite in all well behaved quantum states , @xmath7 is singular in the limit that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are null separated .",
    "there is a useful decomposition of operator products which classifies the various contributions to the correlation function .",
    "let @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are free quantum fields , or derivatives of fields .",
    "the stress tensor operator @xmath5 is a sum of such terms .",
    "it may be shown using wick s theorem that @xmath15 where @xmath16    @xmath17    and @xmath18 thus the operator product @xmath19 consists of a purely vacuum part @xmath20 , a fully normal - ordered part @xmath21 , and a part @xmath22 which is a cross term between the vacuum and normal - ordered parts .",
    "the expectation value of the product of stress tensors can be expressed as the sum of these three contributions : @xmath23 where the last two terms are the cross term and vacuum term , respectively . in the limit that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 observable quantities will be expressed as integrals of the correlation function",
    ". however , the singularities in the cross and vacuum terms are not integrable in a naive way . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , one solution to this problem is an integration by parts procedure .",
    "this method allows one to define the relevant integrals , and will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "an alternative approach , which will not be pursued in detail in this paper , is to use dimensional regularization . in this approach ,",
    "the divergent part of a stress tensor correlation function can be expressed in a local form , which arises from counterterms in the action of the form of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ricci tensor  @xcite .",
    "for a classical spacetime , einstein s equations relate the ricci tensor @xmath29 to the stress tensor by @xmath30 in the case of a spacetime with fluctuations driven by stress tensor fluctuations , we assume that this algebraic relation between the ricci and stress tensors still holds . a useful probe of the fluctuations of the ricci tensor is the raychaudhuri equation .",

    "a , we give a heuristic treatment of the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath61 , and argue that we should expect a blurring angle of the order of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the distance to the source .",
    "our treatment is heuristic because we actually analyze the situation of a source in flat spacetime whose position fluctuates .",
    "we conjecture that a careful treatment of the effects of a fluctuating spacetime geometry will give a result of the same order of magnitude .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath33 are also related to fluctuations in the brightness , or apparent luminosity of the source , as is discussed in appendix b. in general , @xmath60 is given in terms of an integral of the expansion correlation function , however , in some cases , it is of the same order as @xmath59 .      in order for the contributions of the cross and vacuum terms to be finite , it is necessary to average over a spacetime volume .",
    "this volume is the interior of the world tube defined by the bundle of geodesics .",

    "this leads to @xmath138 we may evaluate the integral of @xmath139 in the same manner as used for the vacuum term : @xmath140 then @xmath141 note that this expression , and hence the contribution of the cross term , vanishes in the limit that @xmath142 for fixed @xmath120 .",

    "here we have used a specific choice of averaging .",
    "one topic for future research will be to generalize this choice . in particular , it will be of interest to write covariant expressions for @xmath106 and @xmath149 as derivatives of logarithmic functions , and then integrate over a four - dimensional spacetime region .      we have defined the singular terms of the ricci tensor by averaging over a world tube containing the bundle of geodesics . the shape of this world tube is determined by its spatial width @xmath86 , which describes the transverse distance from the central geodesic , and its temporal width @xmath85 .    as far as the temporal smearing is concerned , it is worth noting that the parameter @xmath85 only appears in the pure vacuum term , and does not affect results obtained for state - dependent terms ( the cross terms and the fully normal - ordered term ) . if one assumes that pure vacuum effects in minkowski spacetime are unphysical , or least unobservable , a discussion of the meaning of @xmath85 is rendered superfluous .",
    "however , if we remain open to the possibility that the pure vacuum effects possess physical significance , we should attempt to connect @xmath85 with some concrete length scale in the problem .",
    "there are a few reasonable options to chose from .",
    "certainly the following come to mind : the wavelength of the source , the coherence length of the source , and the duration of time over which the light source is collected .",
    "the latter , in at least one respect , seems the least appealing .",
    "it would suggest that the vacuum effect could be made arbitrarily large by leaving the measuring device on for an arbitrarily long time ( noting the power dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vac_phi ] ) .",
    "if we are concerned with finding a upper bound when the measuring process is arbitrarily extended in time , it seems more likely that the coherence length of the light source , or even the smallest scale involved , the wavelength , should be related to the temporal smearing .",
    "the argument here is that the photon extends off the lightcone , but certainly no more than the temporal size of its wave packet , and no less than the resolution provided by its characteristic wavelength .    on the other hand",
    ", it seems most natural to associate the width of the bundle with the parameters of the experimental set - up , determined by both conditions at the source and at the observer .",
    "that is , it seems we can associate the width of the bundle @xmath86 with the two quantities : the aperture of the device used to collect the light rays , and the size of the emitting source . if both could be fixed to the same size , we would effectively enclose the bundle of geodesics within a cylinder extending along the entire flight path . under such a circumstance it seems safe to say that @xmath86 would simply be the radius of the cylinder . in the case of point source emissions , @xmath86 might be sensibly set to the average width of the bundle along the flight path , i.e. one half of the aperture s diameter . for a larger source ,",
    "@xmath86 should perhaps an average between the diameter of the emitting source and the diameter of the aperture .",
    "now we turn to the case of a thermal state , so the fluctuations of the expansion have their origin in thermal fluctuations of the scalar field stress tensor . in this subsection , we consider the limit of a localized ray in the sense discussed above . the limit in which @xmath85 and @xmath86 are small is equivalent to a low temperature limit because the thermal wavelength is large compared to these scales . in this limit",
    ", we need to consider only the effect of the fully normal ordered term , so we must calculate the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cno ] ) .",
    "there is a useful identity which can be used for this purpose : @xmath150 where the expectation values are taken in a thermal state .",

    "( [ eq : ident ] ) must also be valid for thermal states .",

    "the effects of the fully - normal ordered term are unambiguous , but those of the vacuum and cross terms contain singular parts which need to be defined by a spacetime averaging over a bundle of rays .",
    "this may be done by the integration by parts procedure discussed in appendix c. this procedure involves some undetermined constants , some of which can be eliminated by a scaling argument .",
    "unfortunately , the overall constant which determines the magnitude of the vacuum contribution is not fixed .",

    "as noted above , one topic for future research will be the use of covariant averaging .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : del_theta ] ) describes the effects of the ricci tensor fluctuations , not the expansion due to any mean ricci curvature .",
    "our treatment has assumed a nearly flat background spacetime , more generally , the non - zero mean value of the stress tensor will lead to mean ricci curvature and hence classical focusing .",
    "recall that we assumed that the @xmath39 term in the raychaudhuri equation , eq .  ( [ eq : ray ] ) , can be neglected .",
    "as @xmath58 grows , this assumption will eventually break down .",

    "we also assumed that the shear and vorticity terms in the raychaudhuri equation can be ignored .",
    "so long as the bundle of geodesics is hypersurface orthogonal , the vorticity remains zero in all classical spacetimes , so it is reasonable to expect that small quantum geometry fluctuations will not generate any vorticity .",
    "the shear can grow in response to non - zero weyl curvature .",
    "thus if the stress tensor fluctuations cause the weyl tensor to fluctuate , through the excitation of gravitational wave modes , then eventually @xmath227 could become important .",

    "the @xmath33-fluctuations are due to fluctuations in the spacetime geometry between the source and the observer .",

    "however , we offer this as a heuristic estimate of the magnitude of angular blurring expected in a fluctuating spacetime .      in this appendix",
    ", we show how the stochastic behavior of the expansion leads to small deviations in the density of geodesics . in the case of light rays",
