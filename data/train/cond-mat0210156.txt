    "the process of phase - separation occurring in binary systems quenched below the coexistence line has been matter of intensive investigations since many years .",
    "the overall phenomenology is nowadays reasonably well understood . in an early stage ,",
    "whose properties depend on the system specific details , domains of the two phases form ; the relative concentration of the two species well inside the domains quickly saturates to a value very similar to the equilibrium composition .",
    "then a crossover leads to the late stage dynamics which is characterized by the growth of ordered regions of typical size @xmath4 and by a statistically invariant morphology .",
    "this phenomenology is at the basis of the well known scaling property according to which a single length @xmath4 is asymptotically relevant : system configurations at different times are simply related by a scale transformation with a scale factor @xmath4 . in particular , for the equal time density - density correlation function one has g(r , t)=g , [ sca ] meaning precisely that @xmath5 is invariant as a function of scaled lengths @xmath6 .",
    "the growth of @xmath4 is of the power law type @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamic exponent @xmath8 depends on the specific microscopic mechanisms responsible for the segregation process ; in general different dynamical regimes can be observed , characterized by different values of @xmath8 , by changing the experimental time window @xcite . when the system enters the late stage the memory of the initial state",
    "is lost and , due to the presence of one single growing length , its properties become universal .",
    "then the dynamical exponents , the scaling function @xmath9 and other observables become independent on the system specific details and are only determined by a few relevant parameters . besides the spatial dimensionality , the presence of conservation laws is a relevant feature . for binary fluids ,",
    "to which we restrict our attention , the concentration of the species is conserved as the phase - separation proceeds . the initial stage of the scaling regime , before hydrodynamic effects become relevant , is the subject of this paper . for viscous fluid",
    "this time window can be sufficiently wide to be detected experimentally . in this condition",
    "the phase - separation process is ruled by the evaporation , diffusion and subsequent recondensation of monomers @xcite and the exponent @xmath8 is known to be @xmath10 , independent on the space dimension @xmath11 .",
    "the spatial properties are encoded into the scaling function @xmath12 or , equivalently , into its fourier transform @xmath13 . for large @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 has a power - law tail of the form @xmath16 : this is the famous porod s law @xcite , long recognized as arising from sharp domains walls .",
    "another relevant parameter affecting the scaling properties is the number of components @xmath17 of the order parameter @xmath18 . for binary fluids",
    "@xmath19 is a scalar field .",
    "most of the analytical techniques developed to study the kinetics , among which the bray - humayun scheme that is considered throughout this article , are however suited for vectorial systems with large-@xmath17 .",
    "let us briefly discuss the main features of vectorial systems that will be recalled in this paper . for systems with a continuous symmetry ,",
    "rotations of the order parameter on the @xmath20 symmetric manifold of the local ground state of the hamiltonian , instead of evaporation and condensation , is the important growth mechanism .",
    "this changes @xmath8 to @xmath21 , regardless both of @xmath11 and @xmath17 ( apart from exceptional cases @xcite ) . concerning the large-@xmath14 behavior of @xmath15 a generalization of the porod s law ,",
    "@xmath22 is obeyed @xcite for @xmath23 .",
    "this form relies on the existence of stable localized topological defects .",
    "much less is known about the tails of @xmath15 when these defects are not present , for @xmath24 .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite found a stretched - exponential decay @xmath25 $ ] .    despite this rather simple phenomenology",
    "the problem of deriving the scaling properties from first principles is still open . on the analytical side ,",
    "the only soluble model @xcite for conserved order parameter is the one with @xmath26 . when considering this unphysical limit one hopes that the gross features of the kinetic process are retained for @xmath26 leaving further refinements to @xmath27 perturbation theories .",
    "however , although the global behavior of the @xmath26 model is qualitatively resemblant @xcite of real systems , the scaling symmetry  ( [ sca ] ) is violated already at a qualitative level .",
    "the explicit solution of the model @xcite shows in fact that instead of the standard scaling  ( [ sca ] ) one has a _ multiscaling _ symmetry produced by the existence of two logarithmically different lengths .",
    "actually the ordering process with @xmath26 is more a _",
    "condensation _ in momentum space @xcite , than a genuine phase - separation process .",
    "these results shadow the possibility to develop a successful theory of the segregation process by systematic @xmath27 expansions around the large-@xmath17 limit .    in this scenario a prominent role is played by a class of approximate theories known as gaussian auxiliary field theories , originally introduced by mazenko @xcite .",
    "the essence of these is a non - linear mapping between the order parameter @xmath28 and an auxiliary field @xmath29 .",
    "the actual form of the relationship @xmath30 is largely arbitrary and , depending on different physically motivated choices , different schemes have been developed @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that with a proper choice of @xmath30 the equation obeyed by the auxiliary field can be treated to lowest order in a mean - field approximation while the basic non - linearities of the evolution are still retained through the non - linear mapping @xmath30 .",
    "ad hoc _ assumption is generally uncontrolled and its use is justified _ a posteriori _ by the satisfactory quality of the predictions .",
    "starting from the method of mazenko , bray and humayun ( bh ) have derived @xcite a non - linear closed equation of motion for the correlation function @xmath31 within the framework of the @xmath27 perturbative expansion .",
    "letting @xmath32 in the bh equation one recovers the large-@xmath17 model previously discussed ; the bh approach , however , does not amount to a straightforward @xmath27-expansion because all orders in @xmath27 are reintroduced through the gaussian auxiliary field approximation . on one side , the uncontrolled character is the limit of the bh scheme , since it is not clear how to improve the approximation , but on the other side , represents a powerful tool to overcome the shortcomings of standard perturbation theory previously discussed . as shown by bh",
    "their equation reinstates standard scaling  ( [ sca ] ) as a truly asymptotic symmetry , leaving to multiscaling a merely pre - asymptotic role .",
    "an additional feature at variance with the @xmath26 limit is the form of the scaling function @xmath13 , which , in the bh approximation falls exponentially at large momenta , as opposed to the quartic exponential decay of the @xmath33 model .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the diffusive phase separation process of a binary fluid in the presence of an applied shear flow , namely an imposed fluid velocity along @xmath34 with a constant gradient along @xmath35 .",
    "the presence of the flow radically changes the behavior and even the phenomenology is much less understood .",
    "a first trivial effect is the anisotropic deformation of the growing pattern that appears greatly elongated along @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "then , when dealing with growth laws one has to specify the length of the equilibrated regions for each direction , @xmath36 , and in general @xmath37 .",
    "a more subtle point , that may have important consequences , is the following : stretching of the domains causes ruptures of the network @xcite that may render the segregation incomplete .",
    "actually , the characteristic lengths in the different directions could keep on growing indefinitely , as without shear , or due to domains break - up the system may eventually enter a stationary state characterized by domains with a finite thickness .",
    "in general there is no agreement on this point both from the experimental @xcite and theoretical point of view . on the theoretical side large-@xmath17 calculations @xcite show the existence of a multiscaling regime with ever growing lengths in all directions .",
    "however numerical simulations @xcite can not still establish a clear evidence due to finite size and discretization effects . another intriguing feature which is probably related to the stretching and break - up of the domains is the observation of an oscillatory pattern in the observables .",
    "let us consider the excess viscosity @xmath38 as an example .",
    "stretching of domains require work against surface tension leading to an increase of @xmath38 .",
    "however when a domain breaks up the stress is released since the fragments are more isotropic ; this produces a decrease of @xmath38 .",
    "if repeated in time this mechanism produces an oscillatory pattern that is observed in simulations @xcite and possibly in experiments @xcite . in the large-@xmath17 limit",
    "it can be shown that this process has a periodicity in @xmath39 .",
    "similar patterns are also reported in apparently different contexts as fractures in heterogeneous solids @xcite or in stock market indices @xcite , suggesting a possible common underlying interpretation .",
    "however we do not have nowadays analytical tools to enlighten this feature .",
    "the spatial properties of the mixture are encoded into the correlation function @xmath31 or , equivalently , into its fourier transform @xmath40 , the structure factor .",
    "the latter is directly measured with scattering techniques and is more suited for comparison with the experiments .",
    "the form and the evolution of @xmath41 are themselves modified by the presence of the flow .",
    "when the shear becomes effective , after an initial isotropic regime where @xmath41 has the shape of a circular volcano , the tip of @xmath41 is deformed into an ellipses .",
    "this is expected as a consequence of the anisotropy , and is generally observed in experiments . in some cases",
    "the presence of four pronounced peaks on the edge of @xmath41 can be detected @xcite .",
    "the existence of these multiple maxima has been also observed in numerical studies @xcite of phase separation and in different physical systems such as stationary microemulsion in shear flow @xcite , suggesting that this is a rather general feature of sheared fluids .",
    "a peak in the structure factor is generally interpreted as the signature of a characteristic length proportional to the inverse of the wavevector where the peak is located . in this anisotropic case to each peak one associates one typical length for each space direction . taking into account the symmetry",
    "@xmath42 this suggests that a couple of characteristic lengths for each direction is present : it is not completely clear , however , to which extent this interpretation can be pushed .    in this",
    "partly unclear scenario the development of theoretical tools for reliable predictions to be tested in experiments is important . in the case without shear the bh scheme turns out to be a reference theory capable to describe the main ingredients of the phenomenology . therefore in this paper",
    "we address a numerical solution of the bh equation in the presence of shear flow",
    ". we will compare its behavior with previous results pertaining to the large-@xmath17 limit or to numerical simulations of the fully non - linear scalar model .",
    "our results confirm the occurrence of a scaling regime with growing lengths in every direction .",
    "the dynamical exponents are found to coincide with those of the @xmath26 model .",
    "the four peak pattern for the structure factor is exhibited , similarly to what observed both for @xmath33 and in the scalar model , the actual form of @xmath41 being , however , rather different in the three cases .",
    "concerning the oscillating behavior of the typical lengths and of the excess viscosity , on the other hand , the bh model behaves quite differently , in that these are strongly inhibited or even absent , at variance with @xmath26 and @xmath43 .",
    "this paper is divided in 4 sections : in sec .",

    "[ results ] the results of the numerical solution are presented and a comparison with different approaches is proposed . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we draw the conclusions of this work .",
    "we consider a system described by an order parameter with @xmath17 components .",
    "the evolution is described by the convection - diffusion equation @xcite that generalizes the cahn - hilliard - cook equation in the case of an applied velocity field @xmath44 + = ^2 + * * ( x , t ) [ chc ] where @xmath45 is the vector order parameter that in the scalar case represents the concentration difference between the two species of the fluid , @xmath46 is the space coordinate , @xmath47 is a transport coefficient and @xmath48 is a gaussian stochastic field with expectations @xmath49 describing thermal fluctuations .",

    "for a plane shear flow the velocity term is given by v = y e_x [ shear ] where @xmath57 is the unit vector in the flow direction @xmath34 and @xmath58 is the shear rate .    in the approximation framework developed by bh @xcite the following equation of motion",

    "here we use the self - consistent determination of @xmath63 r(t)=g[g(0,t)-s_eq ] [ r ] that is usually adopted @xcite . for @xmath26 , namely dropping the cubic term on the r.h.s . , eq .  ( [ bh ] ) becomes the @xmath26 model .",

    "some comments about the role of @xmath17 are in order .",
    "( [ bh ] ) is derived in an @xmath27 perturbative framework .",
    "then , in principle , the quality of the approximation is expected to be better for large @xmath17 and , in any case , this whole approach is meaningful for vectorial systems with continuous symmetry . given that the nature of the symmetry is relevant for the scaling properties , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , one can not pretend to push this scheme down to the physically relevant case with @xmath43 in a completely successful way .",
    "however , besides numerical simulation that are quite difficult and not particularly instructive in this case , most of the understanding of phase separation with shear comes nowadays from the @xmath26 model , which surely suffers of much more profound shortcomings than the present approach , if used to infer the properties of physical systems .",
    "the bh scheme represents a first step beyond @xmath26 , despite of course being not conclusive .",
    "it must be recalled , moreover , that at least without shear the bh equation substantially reproduces the behavior of the system with @xmath26 , including multiscaling , in a preasymptotic time domain @xmath65 after which the cubic correction in eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) becomes effective @xcite .",

    "this figure shows that in the large-@xmath94 tail the structure factor decays exponentially , as already observed without imposed flow  @xcite , at variance with the faster decay observed for @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the absence of power - law tails is related to the absence of stable localized topological defects in the bray - humayun approximation .",
    "next we consider the growth laws . for @xmath33 , in the large time region",
    "@xcite @xmath95 and @xmath96 keep increasing with ( logarithmically corrected ) power laws @xmath97 , @xmath98 modulated by a log - periodic oscillation .",

    "[ exponents ] as already anticipated the exponents are those pertaining to systems with continuous symmetry .",
    "furthermore one can observe that the shear rate enters linearly in @xmath95 but the growth in the shear direction @xmath35 is unaffected by @xmath58 . for completeness",
    "we recall that in the full scalar model one expects different exponents , namely @xmath106 , @xmath107 from scaling @xcite or renormalization group @xcite arguments , but these are not yet clearly observed in simulations .",
    "moreover the very existence of an asymptotic scaling dynamics is debated in this case .",
    "( [ figradii]a ) shows that initially both @xmath95 and @xmath96 start growing with an exponent which is consistent with the value @xmath108 as in absence of shear . in this time regime",

    "the numerical integration of the bh model presented insofar shows that eq .",

    "now we turn to the discussion of fig .",
    "( [ figexc ] ) where the behavior of the excess viscosity is reported .",
    "in all the cases considered @xmath111 initially grows to a maximum , then falls negative and raises to a second maximum .",
    "this pattern has been observed also in experiments @xcite and is referred to as _",
    "double overshoot_. after the second maximum the asymptotic stage is entered . on the basis of scaling arguments",
    "one expects that @xmath111 scales as @xmath112 times the inverse of the typical volume @xmath113 of the domains of the two species .",

    "can not be extracted from simulations , but the oscillations are observed .",
    "in this article we have considered the behavior of a binary fluid quenched below the mixing temperature in the presence of an applied shear flow .",
    "the description of this system has been carried out in the context of the continuum convection - diffusion equation based on the ginzburg - landau equilibrium free energy .",
    "the nature of our approach , which neglects hydrodynamic effects , limits the domain of applicability of the model to the diffusive regime which takes place at short times .",
    "we have studied this model in the approximation scheme introduced by bray and humayun .",
    "this amounts to an expansion in @xmath27 on top of the auxiliary field theory approximation originally introduced by mazenko .",
    "a comparison is also presented with two different approaches : the @xmath33 limit and the full scalar model , which is the most appropriate for fluids .",
    "the first has the great advantage to be fully soluble analytically , al least in the large time domain , providing an unambiguous description .",
    "furthermore it can be easily studied numerically from the instant of the quench onwards . however , besides the fact that the case @xmath33 is far from physical , it has also proved to violate the qualitative symmetry of standard scaling in favor of multiscaling , rendering this model insecure as an approximation to real systems . on the other hand",
    "the full scalar model is well suited for describing fluids but it can not be studied analytically .",
    "numerical simulations , although important , have not yet provided clear evidences of the basic phenomenology , due to technical limitations .",
    "the bh model is ideally located in between these two : it shares with the large-@xmath17 limit the property of being a closed equation for an observable , the correlation function , that is already an ensemble average . then , even if one resorts in the end to a numerical solution , one still has the great advantage to avoid the average over a large number of realizations .",
    "secondly , due to its perturbative character , it is believed to represent a step forward with respect to the case @xmath33 .",
    "this statement has been proven to be correct at least without shear .",
    "given the essence of the bh scheme , one does not expect to obtain a fully reliable approximation to real systems with @xmath43 .",
    "the spirit of this work is more to establish if and to which extent its phenomenology compares better to the numerical simulations of the physical model than to the case @xmath33 . from the analysis of the behavior of the characteristic lengths and of the excess viscosity",
    "we can conclude that the bh model behaves more like the @xmath33 case with damped oscillations than like the full scalar model , despite that , with the choice @xmath43 , the corrections to the case @xmath33 contained in eq .",
    "( [ bh ] ) are effective almost from the beginning , as it is clear from figs .",
    "( [ figradii],[figexc ] ) .",
    "this is true not only for the value of the dynamic exponents , but also for the qualitative behavior of the typical lengths .    on the other hand ,",
    "regarding the oscillating character of most observables , the bh model behaves rather differently from both @xmath33 and @xmath43 in that strong oscillations are observed in the latter two while they are practically absent in the former . under this respect",
    "the bh model is atypical and can not be regarded as a bridge between @xmath33 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is possible that the bh scheme resembles more the behavior of vectorial system with a finite @xmath17 under shear , but this is a totally unexplored field .    regarding the important issue of the existence of an asymptotic scaling regime characterized by ever growing lengths @xmath116 , in the time range accessed in this work we do not see any saturation effect and both @xmath95 and @xmath96 keep firmly growing with the expected power laws . in the bh scheme ,",
