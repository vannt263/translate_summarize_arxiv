    "approximately 70 percent of the main and pre - main sequence stars are members of binary or multiple star systems .",
    "observational evidence indicates that many of these systems contain potentially planet - forming circumstellar or circumbinary disks implying that planet formation may be a common phenomenon in and around binary stars @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been made to detect such _ binary - planetary _ systems . in the past two decade , even though single stars were routinely prioritized in search for extrasolar planets , many of these efforts were successful and resulted in the detection of approximately 40 planet - hosting binary star systems . the discovery of these systems have led to the speculation that many more planets may exist in and around binaries and prompted astronomers to explore the possibility of the detection of these planets with different detection methods .",
    "we refer the reader to _ planets in binary star systems _",
    "@xcite for an up to date and comprehensive review of the current state of observational and theoretical research in this area .    in general",
    ", one can distinguish three types of planetary orbits in a binary star system ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) :    1 .   * s - type , * where the planet orbits one of the two stars , 2 .",
    "* p - type , * where the planet orbits the entire binary , 3 .   * t - type , * where the planet orbits close to one of the two equilibrium points @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( trojan planets ) .        currently , the most known planets in binary systems are in s - type orbits [ for more details see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] .",
    "the stellar separations of many of these binaries are larger than 100 au implying that the perturbation of their farther companions on the formation and dynamical evolution of planets around their planet - hosting stars may be negligible .",
    "however , in the past few years , radial velocity and astrometry surveys have been able to identify five binary star systems with separations of approximately 20 au where one of the stars is host to a jovian - type planet .",
    "these systems , namely , gl 86 @xcite , @xmath2 cephei @xcite , hd 41004 @xcite , hd 196885 @xcite , and hd 176051 @xcite present unique cases for the study of planet formation and dynamics in binaries as the perturbation of their secondary stars will have significant effects on the dynamics of their circumprimary disks and their capability in forming planets .",
    "the success of radial velocity and astrometry in detecting planets in s - type orbits raises the question that whether other techniques can also detect planets in and around binary stars .",
    "a recent success has come in the form of the detection of the first p - type planets using the etv method .",
    "modeling the variations in the eclipse timing of the binary nn ser , @xcite have shown that this system is host to two planets with minimum masses of 2.2 and 6.9 jupiter - masses in a 2:1 mean - motion resonance in circumbinary orbits .",
    "our work has been motivated by this discovery .",
    "nn ser ( ab ) is an eclipsing short period binary which shows long - term etvs .",
    "the detection of p - type planets around this system suggests that close , eclipsing binaries may be promising candidates in the search for new exoplanets . as many of these binaries lie in the discovery space of corot @xcite and",
    "@xcite space telescopes , we focus our study on exploring the prospects of the detection of such objects .",
    "the idea of photometric detection of extrasolar planets around eclipsing binaries was first presented by @xcite .",
    "this idea that was later developed by many authors @xcite , is based on the fact that a circumbinary planet can perturb the orbit of the two stars and create variations in their eclipse timing .",
    "the measurements of these variations , when compared with theoretical models , can reveal information about the mass and orbital elements of the perturbing planet .",
    "recently @xcite studied the potential of the etv method in detecting giant planets in circular , circumbinary orbits .",
    "these authors have shown that ground - based photometry may have advantage over corot and _ kepler _ space telescopes in detecting circumbinary planets .",
    "they suggest that the selective nature of the target stars in the fields of view of corot and _ kepler _ causes the etv signals of eclipsing binaries in these regions to be smaller than the detection sensitivities of these telescopes .",
    "these authors also suggest that if target binary stars include presumably less stable contact binaries , the corot s and _ kepler _ s capabilities of detecting of circumbinary planets increase by four times .    in this paper , we extend the study by @xcite to binaries with planets in eccentric and resonant orbits .",
    "it is expected that similar to the transit timing variation method where ttv signals are strongly enhanced when the transiting and perturbing planets are in resonance @xcite , a resonant perturbing circumbinary planet will also produce high etv signals .",
    "the goal of our study is to identify regions of the parameter - space for which this signal is within the temporal sensitivity of corot and _ kepler _ space telescopes .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows .",
    "we present our models in section 2 and discuss their stability in section 3 .",
    "section 4 has to do with the calculations of etvs and the prospects of the detection of p - type planets .",
    "section 5 concludes this study by summarizing the results and discussing their implications .",
    "we consider a close , eclipsing binary with a giant planet in a p - type orbit . to ensure that the effect of the variations of the mass - ratio of the binary is included in our study",
    ", we consider the following three models where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the masses of the primary and secondary stars , respectively ,    * * model 1 : * @xmath5 , * * model 2 : * @xmath6 , * * model 3 : * @xmath7 .",
    "as most of the stars in the solar neighborhood are of spectral type m , this choice of models ensures that low - mass binary stars are also included in our simulations .",
    "eclipsing binaries are morphologically classified as    1 .   * detached systems , * if neither component fills its roch lobe ( separated stars ) , 2 .   * semi - detached systems , * if only one component fills its roche lobe , and 3 .   * over contact systems , * if both components exceed their roche lobes .",
    "the roche lobe marks the volume limit at which the star may begin to lose substantial amount of matter to its companion . in this study",
    "we consider a * detached binary * with an initial separation of 0.05 au .",
    "for the binary models 1 and 3 , this separation corresponds to a period of approximately 5 and 3 days , respectively .",
    "as shown by @xcite , most candidate eclipsing binaries in the discovery space of corot have periods between 1 and 10 days .    when dealing with close binaries such as the models considered here , the intrinsic eccentricity of the binary ( @xmath8 ) can be neglected .",
    "this is due to the high probability of circularization that is caused by interstellar tidal forces . in this study",
    ", we consider the initial orbital eccentricity of the binary to be zero or have very low values .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that the timescale of circularization is dependent upon specific stellar parameters @xcite .",
    "prior to calculating the variations in the eclipse timing , it is necessary to identify regions where a p - type planet can have a stable orbit . for this purpose , we integrated the newtonian three - body system of the binary and its planet for different values of the planet s mass and orbital elements .",
    "the mass of the planet was taken to be 1 , 5 , and 10 jupiter - masses .",
    "the values of its semimajor axis and orbital eccentricity with respect to the barycenter of the system were varied between @xmath9 au and @xmath10 in increments of @xmath11 au and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "numerical integrations were carried out using the lie - series method and bulirsch - stoer integrator @xcite .",
    "we integrated the system for @xmath13 years which corresponds to the following number of periods of the planet at 0.1 au :    * * model 1 : * @xmath14 periods , * * model 2 : * @xmath15 periods , * * model 3 : * @xmath16 periods .",
    "the stability of the planetary motion was controlled by measuring the value of its maximum orbital eccentricity ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we monitored the changes in the eccentricity of the planet throughout the integration and determined its highest value . if the orbit of the planet became parabolic ( @xmath18 ) , we considered the system to be unstable .",
    "figure 2 shows the values of planet s @xmath19 at different distances from the barycenter of the binary .",
    "the left column corresponds to the binary model 1 , the middle column to binary model 2 , and the right column to binary model 3 .",
    "also , from top to bottom , each row corresponds to the values of @xmath19 for a 1 @xmath20 , 5 @xmath20 , and 10 @xmath20 , respectively . in each panel , the axes represent the initial values of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the planet at the beginning of the integration .",
    "the color at each point depicts the maximum value that the eccentricity of the planet acquired during the integration .",
    "as indicated by the scale on the right side of the figure , yellow corresponds to parabolic orbits and denotes instability .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath19 maps shown in fig .",
    "2 indicates that for planets in circular or low eccentricity orbits , the range of the semimajor axis for which the planetary orbit may be bound is large and does not change much for different values of the planet s mass .",
    "for instance , as shown by the top left panel of this figure , the boundary of the unstable zone for a 1 @xmath20 planet in a circular orbit in the binary model 1 is interior to 0.1 au .",
    "this suggests that all circular orbits with semimajor axes larger than 0.1 au in this model may be bound . as the mass of the planet grows ( middle and bottom panels of the left column in fig .",
    "2 ) , the outer boundary of the unstable region slowly progresses toward larger semimajor axes .",
    "such a trend is also seen in the @xmath19 maps of binary models 2 and 3 . as shown by the lower panels in the middle and right columns ,",
    "the boundary of the unstable zone for circular orbits is slightly shifted outward to 0.11 au .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of the stability analysis of a test particle in a circumbinary orbit as presented by dvorak et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) .",
    "according to the estimate of the boundary of the stable zone as given by these authors , the critical distance beyond which the orbit of a jovian planet in all our three binary models will be stable is in the range of 0.1 to 0.12 au .",
    "while the value of @xmath19 can be used to identify parabolic ( unstable ) orbits , it can not be used as a rigorous indicator of planet s orbital stability .",
    "a low value of @xmath19 implies a bound planetary orbit .",
    "but that is only for the duration of the integration , and there is no guarantee that the orbit of the planet will stay bound for a long time . in order to determine the orbital stability of the planet",
    ", we used the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ) @xcite .",
    "the fli is a chaos indicator that measures the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories and distinguishes between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "for details of this technique , we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . applications of fli to planetary motion in binary star systems can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a sample of an fli stability map for a 1 @xmath20 planet in binary model 1 .",
    "the colors in this figure represent the values of fli ( the logarithmic scale on the right ) which depict the degree of chaos .",
    "dark colors correspond to less chaotic and regular orbits . as shown by this figure , there is a region in the parameter - space where the orbit of the planet is likely stable ( dark area between 0.1 and 0.3 au ) .    a comparison between the dark region of fig .",
    "3 and its corresponding region in the system s @xmath19 map in fig .",
    "2 ( upper left panel ) points to an interesting observation : even though the maximum values of the planet s orbital eccentricity can reach to high values , the orbit of the planet may still be stable . in other words , elevated planetary eccentricities do not necessarily correspond to instability .",
    "for instance , as shown by the upper left panel of fig .",
    "2 , orbits with initial eccentricities of 0.3 may have @xmath17 values up to 0.7 . nevertheless , according to the fli results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , they are probably long - term stable .    similar comparison can also be made between the chaotic region of fig .",
    "3 ( indicated by red and yellow colors ) and the system s @xmath19 map in fig .",
    "the results point to an inverse phenomenon , that is , instability among seemingly bound orbits . for instance , while for semimajor axes ranging from @xmath21 au to @xmath22 au , and the eccentricities between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the @xmath17 map suggests bound planetary orbits , the fli stability map indicates chaotic motion .",
    "the different color shades for chaotic orbits in the fli map have resulted from the fact that the degree of divergence depends on the initial conditions of the orbits .",
    "even though this shading may suggest less chaotic islands in parameter - space , when compared to the corresponding @xmath19 map , one can see that orbits inside the chaotic border zone become parabolic .    using the combination of @xmath19 and fli analyses , we identified the stable planetary orbits in all our three binary models .",
    "as an example , the number of stable circular orbits are shown in table [ tab2 ] . as expected , stability is almost independent of the mass - ratio of the binary .",
    "p - type planet in the binary model 1 .",
    "the violet and blue regions ( small values of the fli ) correspond to regions of regular motion , and red and yellow denote chaotic orbits.,width=188 ]    we also carried out simulations for non - zero values of the binary s eccentricity .",
    "figure 4 shows the maps of @xmath19 for a 1 @xmath20 planet in the binary model 1 .",
    "the binary eccentricity was chosen to be @xmath25 0.05 , 0.1 , and 0.15 .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows the number of stable orbits for these simulations . as shown here",
    ", the unstable region expands out by more than two folds when @xmath26 .",
    "our analysis indicated that for the value of the binary eccentricity @xmath27 , only 4 orbits remained stable ( table 2 ) .",
    "the results of our stability analysis allow us to focus our calculations of etvs on the region of the parameter - space where p - type planets have stable orbits .",
    "as shown , the planet s stable region shrinks for large values of its eccentricity as well as the eccentricity of the binary .",
    "initial binary eccentricities beyond @xmath28 move this region to large distances ( @xmath29 au ) where the perturbing effect of the planet on the dynamics of the binary becomes negligible ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
