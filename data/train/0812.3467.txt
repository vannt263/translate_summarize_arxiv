    "as a distinctive type of the neutrino source , the core - collapse supernova ( sn ) provides a rich physical content that is lacking in the terrestrial environment . with its unique production and detection processes , the neutrino burst from a sn has long been considered as one of the promising tools for probing the unknown neutrino intrinsic parameters  @xcite , in particular , the neutrino mass hierarchy and the tiny mixing angle @xmath0 .",
    "however , difficulties also arise from the complexity caused by the unavoidable astrophysical uncertainties , which could lead to ambiguous interpretations of the observed events .",
    "the existing paradigm for the neutrino msw flavor conversion in a sn has been established with the assumption of small neutrino self interaction .",
    "however , a possible new paradigm has been shaped in recent years .",
    "the argument is that , in addition to the standard msw effect , the neutrinos may encounter certain non - msw effects in the sn environment when the neutrino number density is extremely high .",
    "these not so well - known effects may be independent of the msw effect and may introduce additional factors that alter the efficiency of the neutrino flavor transition .",
    "the current consensus is that both types of effects could contribute to the flavor transition and should all be included in the more complete analysis of the sn neutrino signals .",
    "even the standard treatment of the msw flavor conversion alone is not immune from ambiguity .",
    "the uncertain local density profile of the sn matter and the undetermined neutrino spectral parameters , such as the average energy and the luminosity of each neutrino flavor , are the crucial factors involved in the msw effect of the sn neutrinos .",
    "however , an analysis based on the simple global density model : @xmath1 , which is widely adopted in the literature , could lose the generality if the variation of the local density shape near the resonance is not taken into account . with these uncertain factors ,",
    "it is worth while to investigate how the contribution from the standard msw effect should be modified in analyzing the sn neutrino signals , unless the overall contribution from the non - msw effects is much greater than that from the msw effect .",
    "the resonant neutrino flavor transition in a sn and in earth would in principle give rise to observable signatures that reflect the properties of neutrino parameters .",
    "the unknown local density profile of sn matter near the resonance takes part in the adiabaticity parameter of the level crossing , and plays a role in the determination of transition probabilities .",
    "in fact , the adiabaticity of the level crossing could vary abruptly with the local density profile in certain neutrino parameter space .",
    "in addition , the knowledge to the primary spectrum for each neutrino flavor is essential in assessing the efficiency of neutrino flavor conversion .",
    "various mixing scenarios , which arise from the uncertain sn physics , the possible neutrino mass hierarchies , and the uncertain magnitude of @xmath0 lead to distinct neutrino survival probabilities .",
    "an analysis of the observed neutrino signals should , in principle , be able to single out the working scenario .",
    "the promising features of the multi - detector experiments have been well recognized  @xcite . with the uncertain local density profile and the spectral parameters",
    ", this work investigates the potential signatures that may be related to the contribution from the msw effect in a multi - detector analysis of the sn neutrinos . as suggested by the previous work  @xcite",
    ", the consequences due to the uncertain local density profile near the resonance can be accounted for by the adoption of independent and variable power - law density functions @xmath2 . however , the calculations in ref . 13 and 14",
    "are performed under the assumption of nearly constant @xmath3 , which is similar to that adopted in the usual analysis based on @xmath4 . in the present work ,",
    "the key improvement in dealing with the variable density profile is the establishment of variable @xmath3 , which reproduces reasonable densities that agree with the numerical simulations at a wide range of the radial location . with the more general parametrization of the density function ,",
    "this work is further devoted to analyzing the expected neutrino events at two water cherenkov detectors .",
    "focus is aimed at the modified contribution from the msw effect .",
    "certain physical observables derived from the expected event rates at the two detectors are proposed as the discriminators of various transition scenarios for the msw resonance . in searching for the model - independent properties of the observables , three existing sn",
    "neutrino spectral models proposed by the garching group  @xcite and the lawrence livermore group@xcite are adopted in the calculation .",
    "there is no definite way of modeling the practically unknown local variation of density profile . considering the narrow thickness of the resonant layer ,",
    "as compared to that of the whole scope of the sn matter distribution , the density profile with a form of variable power - law in each resonant layer would be a reasonable simplification that accounts for the possible dynamical consequences .",
    "the essence of this approximation is that the power characterizing the density profile in each resonant layer is allowed to vary independently : @xmath5 for the lower resonance layer , and @xmath6 for the higher resonance layer , where the factor @xmath3 denotes the magnitude of the profile @xmath7 , with @xmath8 or @xmath9 .    in this present work ,",
    "the density profile in the resonance layer is parameterized as @xmath10[\\frac{r}{r_{0}}]^{n_{k}},\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a mass scale , and @xmath12 is a distance scale , which is conveniently taken as the solar radius , @xmath13 cm . with the variable @xmath14 ,",
    "an important criterion for a reliable parametrization of the density profile is that the predicted density at a specific radial location agrees with that given by the numerical simulation , at least in order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that in eq.(1 ) the variation of @xmath14 is accompanied by the variation of @xmath11 at a different location .",
    "one may thus write the density profile in a more convenient form as @xmath15[\\frac{c}{c_{0}}][\\frac{r}{r_{0}}]^{n_{k}},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a constant mass scale , and @xmath17 is a reference density scale . in the typical model with a fixed power , @xmath18 ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath11 varies weakly@xcite : @xmath19 in the density range @xmath20 . for variable @xmath14 near a given location ,",

    ", it can be verified that the adiabaticity parameter @xmath41 , and thus the neutrino survival probability , vary weakly with the energy @xmath37 , as compared to the influences from the variations of @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "this result suggests that one may simply adopt the average neutrino energies , @xmath45 , @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 mev , in the following calculation for the neutrino transition probability in sn .",
    "the energy dependence would only appear in calculating the earth effect .",
    "when the neutrinos arrive at earth , the survival probabilities for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given respectively by    @xmath54    @xmath55    for the normal hierarchy , and    @xmath56    @xmath57    for the inverted hierarchy , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the higher and the lower level crossing probabilities for @xmath60 , respectively , and @xmath61 is the element of the mixing matrix .    in calculating the above level crossing probabilities , it should be emphasized that both the higher and the lower level crossings occur in the @xmath62 sector for the normal hierarchy , while the higher crossing occurs in the @xmath63 sector and the lower crossing occurs in the @xmath62 sector if the mass hierarchy is inverted .",

    "in addition , it can be verified that the adiabaticity parameter @xmath69 at the lower resonance is very large , @xmath70 .",
    "this suggests that the lower resonance is adiabatic for both the mass hierarchies : @xmath71 , which leads to @xmath72 .    on the other hand , to show that the variation of @xmath73 and @xmath0 leads to non - trivial structures of @xmath64 in the @xmath74 parameter space , we first estimate the typical density near the location of the higher resonance . using eqs.(5 ) and",

    "however , the uncertain local density profile of the sn matter and the neutrino spectral parameters may lead to diverse interpretations to the neutrino signals from the contribution of the msw effect . to investigate the consequences resulting from these uncertainties ,",
    "this work suggests a more general parametrization for the uncertain local density profile , and outlines a scheme using ratios of experimental observables as the discriminators for the possible scenarios that are related to the msw effect . as an illustration",
    ", we analyze the expected event rates at two terrestrial cherenkov detectors . the consequences due to choices of the existing spectral models are included in the analysis .",
    "the possible scenarios arising from the uncertainties are then examined through the observables @xmath164 , @xmath184 , and @xmath196 .",
    "it is seen that the uncertain local density profile of the sn matter can alter the predictions for @xmath0 and the mass hierarchy from the contribution of the msw effect alone .",
    "the predicted bound for @xmath0 is regulated by the proposed function @xmath91 .",
    "the results in this work are derived from the expected event rates at two megaton - scale cherenkov detectors that would be available in the future .",
    "analyses of the future sn neutrinos based on other types of detectors , such as the liquid argon and kton - scale scintillation detectors that are sensitive to distinct channels of the neutrino interactions , should also provide valuable information toward a better understanding of the neutrino parameters and the sn physics . a detailed analysis based on all the three types of detector",
    "is performed in , @xmath45 , ref .",
    "6 , in which seven sn and neutrino parameters are taken into consideration . to extend the present work",
    ", it would be intriguing to investigate how the uncertain density profile would impact the outcome of the analysis based on the detectors other than the cherenkov ones .    in shaping a possible new paradigm for the neutrino flavor conversion in a sn",
    ", recent studies and simulations suggest that the shock wave propagation and certain types of non - msw flavor conversion may occur in the complex environment of a sn at different space and time scales if the proper physical conditions are met .",
    "these effects , such as the neutrino self coupling in dense media@xcite and the neutrino flavor de - polarization associated with the after shock turbulence@xcite , may have different origins from that of the msw effect and would impact the efficiency of neutrino flavor transition .    it is suggested that the neutrino self interactions induce collective flavor transitions , which may occur before or in the same region as the resonant flavor transition .",
    "the size of modification to the original neutrino flux depends on the mass hierarchy , as well as on the mixing angle @xmath0 . as an example , one considers the simplest case when the self - interaction effects can be factored out from the ordinary msw effects . for the inverted hierarchy",
    ", it is suggested that if @xmath0 is nonzero , the collective pair - conversion of the type @xmath216 can be triggered before the ordinary msw effect occurs@xcite .",
    "thus , even in the simplest case , the altered primary spectra could impact the validity and the usefulness of the observables proposed in this work . a better understanding of the modified neutrino spectra resulting from the collective effects would help in establishing more convenient and useful observables since the knowledge of the neutrino spectra before and after the msw effect is essential for the present analysis . note that the treatment of the variable density profile for the msw effect , as that proposed in this work , is unaffected by the non - msw effects .    the shock wave propagation , on the other hand , may alter the density profile of the sn matter and induce certain non - linear effects that modify the neutrino survival probabilities and the neutrino spectrum .",
    "in particular , there is a possibility that more than one msw - resonance related to the same scale of mass - squared difference could arise due to the shock wave propagation .",
    "the effects of the shock wave on certain physical observables , with the emphasis on the time - dependent properties , are analyzed@xcite .",
    "although the proposed scheme in the present work is limited to the discussion without considering specific scenario due to the shock effects , it takes into account the possible varying density profile , and is not limited to whether the profile is actually primary .",
    "in addition , the quantities @xmath164 , @xmath184 , and @xmath196 are proposed in this work to examine the time - integrated behaviors of the event rates . as an extension to this present analysis",
    ", it would be intriguing to further investigate weather the time structure of the shock waves effects and the possible multiple msw - resonance due to the shock effect can alter the time - integrated properties of the proposed quantities to an observable level . even with the unknown neutrino parameters , the uncertain model for the sn neutrino spectrum , and the possible statistical errors , the quantities @xmath164 , @xmath184 , and @xmath196 might still be able to provide another potential means for probing the sn physics if they reveal time - independent signatures that are related to the shock wave propagation . on the other hand , if the shock signatures are unobservable with these time - integrated quantities , then these quantities might be able to provide insights to the neutrino parameters without being affected by the shock waves .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present work is devoted to effects that are related to the msw resonant flavor transition in a sn .",
    "the focus is aimed at the possible modification to the results of msw effect due to the uncertain density profile .",
    "this modification is expected to have certain impact to the complete analysis based on both the msw effect and the non - msw effects .",
    "the whole details of the non - msw effects , as well as the interplay between the msw and the non - msw consequences , are still not fully understood .",
    "the neutrino flavor conversion in a sn remains as a complicated problem that awaits for more complete answers .",
    "whether the flavor transition arising from one origin would dominate over that from the others depends on the uncertain spectral parameters , the undetermined neutrino intrinsic properties , and the physical conditions that the neutrinos encounter at different stages of the sn environment .",
    "in addition , the reliability of the analysis relies on whether the msw and non - msw effects can be analyzed separately .",
    "however , these unrelated types of effects decouple only when specific physical conditions are met .    in any case ,",
    "analysis of the non - trivial msw flavor conversion due to the possible drastic variation of the local density profile , as discussed in this work , should provide certain insight in probing the neutrino parameters and in shaping a more convincing paradigm for the neutrino flavor conversion in the sn ."
