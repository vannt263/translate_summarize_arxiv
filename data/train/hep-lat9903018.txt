    "it is a challenging problem to determine the order of the phase transition in the physical system where the order changes from the first order to the second one by a small variation of a parameter of the system .",
    "it is important to know how the quantities that remain finite at the first order transition point diverge or vanish when the parameter approaches the point at which the transition changes to the second order one .",
    "the @xmath0-state potts model@xcite in two dimensions gives a good place to investigate the properties of the phase transition around such a point .",
    "it exhibits the first order phase transition for @xmath2 and the second order one for @xmath4 .",
    "many quantities of this model at the phase transition point @xmath5 are known exactly for @xmath2 , including the latent heat@xcite and the correlation length@xcite , which vanishes and diverges , respectively , in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "one the other hand physically important quantities such as the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility at the transition point , which also increase to infinity as @xmath6 , are not solved exactly .",
    "et al._@xcite made a stimulating conjecture on the asymptotic behavior of the energy cumulants including the specific heat at the first order transition point ; the relation between the energy cumulants and the correlation length in their asymptotic behavior at the first order transition point for @xmath6 will be the same as their relation in the second order phase transition for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which is well known from their critical exponents .",
    "if this conjecture is true not only in the @xmath0-state potts model but also in other general physical systems with a phase transition whose order change from the first order to the second one when some parameter of the system is varied , it would give a good guide in investigating such systems .",
    "bhattacharya _ et al._@xcite also made the large-@xmath0 expansion of the energy cumulants to order 10 in @xmath9 and they analyzed the series according to the conjecture , giving the estimates of the cumulants at the first order transition point for @xmath10 .",
    "the obtained estimates are at least one order of magnitude better than those given by other methods such as the monte carlo simulations@xcite and the low-(and high-)temperature expansions@xcite , in spite of the fact that the maximum size of the diagrams taken into account in their large-@xmath0 expansion is less than the correlation length for @xmath11 while the monte carlo simulations are done carefully on the lattice with its size about 30 times as large as the correlation length and also the fact that the maximum size of the diagrams in their large-@xmath0 expansion is as small as the half of the maximum size of the diagrams in the low-(and high-)temperature expansions these strongly suggest the correctness of the conjecture .",
    "the large-@xmath0 series obtained by them are , however , not long enough to investigate the behavior of the energy cumulants for @xmath0 closer to @xmath12 .    in this paper we will enlarge the large-@xmath0 series not only for the energy cumulants but also the magnetization cumulants at the transition point to order of 21 or 23 in @xmath13 using the finite lattice method@xcite , instead of the standard diagrammatic method used by bhattacharya _",
    "et al._. the finite lattice method can in general give longer series than those generated by the diagrammatic method especially in lower spatial dimensions . in the diagrammatic method , one has to list up all the relevant diagrams and count the number they appear . in the finite lattice method",
    "we can skip this job and reduce the main work to the calculation of the expansion of the partition function for a series of finite size lattices , which can be done using the straightforward site - by - site integration@xcite without the diagrammatic technique .",
    "this method has been used mainly to generate the low- and high - temperature series in statistical systems and the strong coupling series in lattice gauge theory .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to demonstrate that this method is also applicable to the series expansion with respect to the parameter other than the temperature or the coupling constant .",
    "such an approach was successfully done by bakaev and kabanovich in generation the long series for the ground - state entropy of the @xmath0-state antiferromagnetic potts model in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "the long large-@xmath0 series obtained here by the finite lattice method enables us to examine the conjecture by bhattacharya _",
    "_ on the asymptotic behavior of the energy and magnetization cumulants for @xmath0 very close to 4 .",
    "we can also give the estimates of these cumulants for each @xmath14 that are orders of magnitude more precise than the estimates by the previous works and they would serve as a target in investigating this model in various contexts , for example in testing the efficiency of a new algorithm of the numerical simulation . a brief note on this subject was already presented in @xcite , where we concentrated only on the specific heat .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the algorithm of the finite lattice method to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the free energy is given for the disordered phase in section 2 and for the ordered phase in section 3 .",
    "the relation between the two algorithms is also discussed in section 3 .",
    "the obtained series for the energy and magnetization cumulants at the phase transition points are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "the series are analyzed to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants at @xmath6 as well as to make the estimation of the cumulants at various values of @xmath2 . in section 6",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and a few remarks .",
    "the model is defined by the partition function @xmath15 where the spin variable @xmath16 at each site @xmath17 takes the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the pair of nearest neighbor sites .",

    "we next define @xmath41 recursively as @xmath42 here the term with @xmath43 and @xmath44 should be excluded in the summation .",
    "then the free energy density defined by eq.([eq : free_energy ] ) is given by@xcite @xmath45    now we have to know from what order in @xmath13 the @xmath41 starts .",
    "only for this purpose , let us suppose to apply the standard cluster expansion@xcite based on the diagrams the large-@xmath0 expansion for the free energy in the disordered phase .",
    "it should be stressed that in the practical calculation of the finite lattice method we need not perform this cluster expansion at all .",
    "a _ polymer _ is defined as a set @xmath29 of bonds that satisfies the condition that there is no division of @xmath29 into two sets @xmath46 and @xmath47 so that @xmath48 .",
    "a set @xmath29 composed of a single bond is a polymer .",
    "below in this paragraph we discuss on the polymers that consists of two or more bonds .",
    "now we define a _ cluster of bonds _ in @xmath29 so that two bonds that are connected by a site belong to the same cluster .",
    "a polymer consisting of two or more bonds is composed of a single cluster of bonds , since a set of bonds composed of more than one disconnected clusters of bonds apparently does not satisfy the condition of a polymer .",
    "a cluster of bonds is a polymer if and only if the cluster of the bonds can not be divided into tow or more clusters of bonds by cutting at any site that is shared by the bonds belonging to the cluster .",
    "we call such a cluster of bonds as _ one - site irreducible_. in fact for a set @xmath49 consisting of a _ one - site reducible _ cluster of bonds that can be divided into clusters @xmath50 of bonds by cutting at a site , we have @xmath51 , which implies that this set of bonds is not a polymer . for a cluster of bonds to be one - site irreducible , it is necessary that the bonds should form one or more closed loops and that each bond should belong to at least one of the loops , which we call _ closed_. an example of a closed cluster of bonds is shown in fig.2(a ) . for each closed cluster of bonds , the loop of the bonds that forms the perimeter of the whole cluster",
    "is called the _ exterior boundary_. the exterior boundary for the closed cluster of bonds in fig.2(a ) is indicated in fig.2(b ) .",
    "an _ interior boundary _ is a loop inside which all bonds are removed and we call the part of the cluster surrounded by the interior boundary as a _ hole_. the closed cluster of bonds in fig.2(a ) has a hole with the interior boundary , as indicated in fig.2(c ) . for a cluster of bonds to be one - site irreducible , not only should it be closed but also its exterior boundary has no crossing . if the exterior boundary has a crossing , as in fig.3 , the cluster of bonds is one - site reducible and is not a polymer .",
    "thus a polymer is the closed cluster of bonds with its exterior boundary having no crossing .",

    "now , according to this theorem , we can know the order of @xmath41 in @xmath13 by examining the clusters of connected polymers that fit into the @xmath37 lattice .",
    "we first note that @xmath61 since the @xmath62 lattice consists of a single site with no bond , so that no polymer can be embedded into this lattice , and @xmath63 since the @xmath64 or @xmath65 lattice consists of two sites connected by one bond , so that a polymer composed of a single bond can be embedded into this lattice .",
    "we also note that @xmath66 for @xmath67 or @xmath68 , because the corresponding lattice consists of the sites connected by bonds all on a straight line and the only clusters of polymers that fit into the lattice are those with each polymer composed only of a single bond and these polymers are not connected according to the definition of the connected polymers .",

    "we first consider a cluster consisting of a single polymer that fits into the @xmath37 lattice .",
    "if the polymer has a concave part in its exterior boundary we can add some bonds to make the part flat , obtaining a new polymer whose activity is changed by a factor of @xmath71 with @xmath72 the number of added bonds , so its order in @xmath13 is lowered .",
    "this implies that a polymer that has concave part in the exterior boundary does not contribute to the lowest order term of @xmath41 in @xmath13 .",
    "let us next consider the case when the polymer has some holes .",
    "the interior boundary surrounding each hole has at least one concave part .",
    "( we take the hole as the exterior of the polymer when we say ` concave ' here . )",
    "we can add some bonds to make the concave part flat , again obtaining a new polymer with the order of its activity in @xmath13 lowered by a factor of @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that a polymer that has a hole does not contribute to the lowest order term of @xmath41 in @xmath13 .",

    "hence we see that their orders are all the same ; that is , the order of @xmath75 .",
    "next we consider a cluster of connected tow or more polymers that fits into the lattice .",
    "it is enough to take into account the clusters of polymers that do not have either a concave part on the boundary or a hole in the interior , since we are going to know the clusters of connected polymers that contributes to the lowest order term in @xmath13 . among the clusters of connected two or three polymers that fit into the lattice , those give the lowest order contribution in which the polymers touch each other only through their exterior boundary and each neighboring pair of polymers share only one bond , like fig.7(a ) , and this type of clusters",

    "so , in order to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the term in the free energy density that is proportional to @xmath94 , it is enough to take into account the finite - size lattices that satisfy @xmath143 in eq.([eq : f_o ] ) .",
    "the algorithms in the previous two sections give the large-@xmath0 expansion of the free energy density at the arbitrary inverse temperature @xmath147 .",
    "the energy cumulants can be obtained by taking its derivative with respect to @xmath147 .",
    "if we are interested in the energy cumulants only at the phase transition point , as is the case here , we can set @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( with @xmath163 and @xmath164 at @xmath5)@xcite , then in order to obtain the @xmath72th cumulant we have only to keep the expansion with respect to @xmath165 to order @xmath166 as @xmath167 using @xmath168 and @xmath169 using @xmath170\\frac{d}{d\\tilde{y}}$ ] .    using this procedure",
    "we have calculated the series to order @xmath171 in @xmath13 for the @xmath72th cumulants with @xmath172 and to order @xmath173 for the cumulants with @xmath174 .",
    "the coefficients of the series are listed in table 1 and 2 for the disordered phase and in table 3 and 4 for the ordered phase .",
    "we have applied the finite lattice method both in the ordered and disordered phases without relying on the duality relations ( [ eq : duality_cumu ] ) for the cumulants .",
    "we have checked that all of @xmath41 and @xmath134 with @xmath143 have the correct order in @xmath13 as described in the previous two sections . the obtained series for the zeroth and first cumulants ( i.e. , the free energy and the internal energy ) agree with the expansion of the exactly known expressions .",
    "the coefficients for @xmath123 agree with those by bhattacharya _",

[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 7.4 cm    = 7.4 cm    in conclusion the pad data of the large-@xmath0 series for the magnetization cumulants also convince us that the conjecture ( [ eq : asymp_m ] ) for the asymptotic form is true at least for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the finite lattice method was applied to generate the large-@xmath0 expansion of the @xmath72th energy cumulants ( @xmath179 ) and of the @xmath72th magnetization cumulants ( @xmath180 and @xmath178 ) at the phase transition point for the ordered and disordered phases in the two - dimensional @xmath0-state potts model .",
    "it enabled us to extend the series of the energy cumulants to the 23rd order in @xmath181 for @xmath172 and to the 21st order for @xmath174 from the 10th order generated by bhattacharya _",
    "_ using the standard diagrammatic method .",
    "it also enabled us to generate the new series of the magnetization cumulants to the 21st order .",
    "we made the pad analysis of the series for the product of each cumulant and some powers of the latent heat that is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath13 if the conjecture by bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "_ is true that the relation between the cumulants and the correlation length in the asymptotic behavior for @xmath182 at @xmath7 will be kept in their asymptotic behavior at the first order transition point for @xmath183 .",
    "it allowed us to present very precise estimates of the cumulants at the transition point for @xmath2 .",
    "the accuracy of the estimates is orders of magnitude higher than the results of the monte carlo simulations and the low-(and high- ) temperature series for @xmath184 , and for instance of about 0.1 percent at @xmath185 where the correlation length is as large as a few thousand lattice spacings and there is no previous data to be compared with , and of a few percent even at the limit of @xmath7 where the correlation length diverges .",
    "the resulting asymptotic behavior of the cumulants for @xmath0 close to 4 is consistent with the conjecture by bhattacharya _",
    "_ not only for the second energy cumulant ( or the specific heat ) but also for the higher energy cumulants .",
    "it is important that the asymptotic behavior of the magnetization cumulants is also consistent with the conjecture , which was not investigated by bhattacharya _",
    "et al._. this strongly suggests that the conjecture would be the case for all the physical quantities that diverge or vanish at the first order phase transition point for @xmath183 .",
