    "the use of polycapillary optics to control x - ray beams in analytical x - ray apparatus for diffraction and fluorescence analyses is becoming increasingly important . in the near future polycapillary optics",
    "will be widely used in many different fields , e.g. , aero - space research , medicine , biology , and so on@xcite .",
    "our strong interest in the development of these devices led to the idea of creating a cad program that allows one to simulate the process of radiation propagation through polycapillary optical systems and to visualize the radiation distributions at the optical output . at present",
    "there are very few procedures available for evaluating x - ray transmission by capillary structures in the case of peculiar configurations , see for instance@xcite .",
    "one of the first papers@xcite reported coherent radiation transmission by a hollow glass pipe .",
    "this code also considered i ) the presence of a rough surface as an x - ray anomalous dispersion effect , ii ) radiation penetration into the channel wall , and iii ) the possible presence of micro - dust inside the channel .",
    "another algorithm@xcite for x - ray transmission by capillaries of various shapes runs in the geometrical optics approximation ; for this reason is simpler and more flexible than the previous model .",
    "the first x - ray tracing codes were developed in 1992@xcite and by the institute for roentgen optics , for a review see@xcite .",
    "however , these simulations used a number of simplifications based either on the cylindrical symmetry for a shaped capillary system or on the meridional ray approximation , which is valid only for describing radiation propagation through a blend channel or a monocapillary concentrator .",
    "to the authors knowledge , the most advanced and complete softwares for x - ray tracing inside capillary channels to date are three : the first code@xcite traces the trajectory of each photon including the corrections of absorption and roughness ; in according with some experimental results , the authors could obtain the roughness of the channel .",
    "the second one@xcite uses the shadow ray tracing software , adapting it to channel shape .",
    "the last code@xcite uses a monte carlo simulation for x - ray radiation propagation through hollow channels .",
    "the theoretical results obtained by this code agree quite well with the experimental data , although the algorithm is rather simple due to its geometrical optics approximation and to the circular cross section of the channel shape .",
    "the main aim of practically all the simulation codes is to optimize both the channel size and the optical shape in order to obtain highly efficient optical systems .",
    "obviously , this is very important from the viewpoint of the development of capillary optics technology .",
    "however , analysis of the radiation distribution features , reported in a number of papers@xcite is particularly interesting .",
    "( some of the earlier publications are cited in reference @xcite ) . in these papers",
    "the experimental data were validated by means of analytical estimations based on the wave theory of radiation propagation .",
    "before we continue any further , let us clarify the terminology used in this work : 1 ) a monocapillary is a single capillary ; 2 ) a polycapillary is a set of closely and packed monocapillaries ; 3 ) a lens is a device that concentrate the radiation in a point or a small region ; 4 ) a semi - lens , or a half - lens is a device that can concentrate a quasi - parallel beam in a point and vice versa in the reverse geometry .    here , we introduce a new x - ray tracing code for polycapillary optics , named _ polycad_. a previous version was designed for cylindrical optics only@xcite .",
    "now , the software can simulate monocapillary and polycapillary optics with cylindrical and conical shapes , while work is in progress to include lenses and semi - lenses .",
    "the advantage of the code lies in its precise mathematical solutions for each given optical shape .",
    "comparison of the results of polycad and of the previous algorithms@xcite revealed some differences , due to the fact that polycad is free of many of the algorithmic constraints .    in the first part of our paper , the theoretical basis of a cylindrical monocapillary",
    "is explained ; in the second , the numerical results and the simulations are reported both for cylindrical and for conical mono- and polycapillaries , using a point - source and an extended - sources , like a conventional x - ray tube .",
    "thanks to some simple formulas it is possible to estimate the correct behavior of the rays inside the capillary .",
    "the total intensity @xmath0 , evaluated at the angle @xmath1 behind a capillary , is given by all the contributions of the photon families that pass through the capillary ; each family is defined by the number of its reflections : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the maximum number of reflections .",
    "it is clear that the intensity @xmath4 is strictly dependent on the reflection coefficient @xmath5 , namely , on the @xmath6 power of @xmath5 :    @xmath7    this contribution is drastically small if the number of reflections is high , because @xmath5 is always less than one , ( example - @xmath8 @xmath9 ) .    in order to consider the total radiation intensity on a screen behind a monocapillary , @xmath0 has to be integrated over the whole plane , so : @xmath10 where the last mathematical passage is possible due to the axial symmetry of the system .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_ref_ter ] , if the screen is placed at @xmath11 , near the focal point @xmath12 , characterized by the ray family with a maximum number of two reflections , the image on the screen is smaller than in any other configuration .",
    "moreover , for only two reflections , there are five different areas of interaction ( figs . [ fig_ref_ter ] and [ mono_f ] ) . however ,",
    "if the screen is placed at @xmath13 , far from the focal point , the picture on the screen does not have a simple shape , but has some zones that are more intense than others ( figs .",
    "[ fig_ref_ter ] and [ mono_3 ] ) .    now that the radiation intensity has been defined ( eq .",
    "[ intensity ] ) , the inner surface of the capillary can be divided into a discrete set of zones according to the number ( 1 , 2 ,  ) of reflections of each photon trajectory .",
    "if the origin of the reference system @xmath14 is located at the end of the capillary and the z - axis coincides with the capillary axis , each zone along the surface has a length given by the following equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance between the end of the capillary and the screen .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig_ref ] and considering only the upper propagation case , each area has a maximum angle @xmath1 and a portion of interaction on the screen , defined by :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the diameter of the capillary and @xmath19 is the @xmath6 reflection coefficient .",
    "the maximum angle for each reflection family can be evaluated as :    @xmath20    from these formulas it is clear that the difference between two consecutive maximum angles is a constant and depends only on the properties of the system . when these properties are fixed , the maximum number of reflections is simple to evaluate : @xmath21}{d/(s+l)}\\,= \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\,&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{s+l}{s}\\,-1 \\right)\\,=\\,\\frac{l}{2s } \\label{n_max_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since there must be at least one reflection , eq .",
    "[ n_max_1 ] becomes the well known expression : @xmath22\\,+\\,1 \\label{numb}\\ ] ]    equation [ numb ] states that the maximum number of reflections depends only on the length and on the diameter of the capillary ; this result is exact if the source stays along the monocapillary z - axis .",
    "equation [ numb ] also remains a good approximation if the source is close to the optical axis ( fig .",
    "[ mono_off ] ) . obviously , in the general case , there are some problems because an off - axis source makes some zones inside the capillary unsuitable for photon reflection@xcite .",
    "in our previous paper@xcite the code was based only on the geometrical symmetry of the system , so the radiation image on a screen could be evaluated only if the shape of capillary was cylindrical .",
    "this new version of polycad is completely different from the old one .    while upgrading the code to include other capillary shapes , the complicated definition of the reflection angle @xmath23 introduced some problems .",
    "for a cylindrical capillary it is easy to find the following relation for @xmath23 : @xmath24}}\\right\\ } } \\label{alpha_ref_cyl}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the zenithal angle and @xmath1 is the angle on the inlet plane ( see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] and ref.@xcite ) .    in the _ conical case _ ,",
    "the @xmath26 angle , formed by the two projections on the tangent plane of the x - ray photon trajectory and of the z - axis , is still a function of @xmath25 and @xmath1 , but now there is also an indirect dependence on the conical semi - opening angle @xmath27 .",
    "this indirect dependence is due to the fact that the trajectory of a photon is generally oblique with respect to the capillary axis .",
    "thus , a new parameter that takes into account the off - axis angle must be included , which does not allow us to transfer in a simple way a 3-d problem into a 2-d one , as done in the case of cylindrical optics@xcite . nevertheless , by knowing the photon starting point , i.e. , the source point @xmath28 and the inlet point @xmath29 , it is possible to define the vector - direction of the photon .",
    "an equation system between the photon path and the capillary surface equation makes it possible to describe the trajectory of the photons inside any generic capillary optics .",
    "to show how polycad works , we report the most significant results",
    ". we would like to emphasize that polycad can simulate any kind of source , from a point source , located at finite or infinite distance , to an extended source , and the latter can also have a 3-d shape .",
    "we first considered a monocapillary or polycapillary with cylindrical channels . even though the system geometry in this case is so simple that the results can be calculated manually , to check that the software worked well the results were compared with those of the old version of polycad designed just for cylindrical capillaries@xcite .",
    "as a preliminary step we considered a point source located at finite distance . the amplitude of the incident angle @xmath25 can be chosen randomly from zero to any prefixed value .",
    "obviously , in the best case this angle is equal to the critical angle , @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , each x - ray photon will have an inlet angle @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plane that is strictly connected with the intersection point @xmath33 ( fig . [ geometry ] ) .    to simplify the analysis of the radiation distribution behind the capillary system , the image shape was considered in two different screen positions : i ) one placed at the focus f2 of the monocapillary or polycapillary and ii ) the other beyond the f2 position ( fig . [ fig_ref_ter ] ) .    to compare these calculations with the results obtained by dabagov and marcelli@xcite , the length of the _ cylindrical monocapillary _ was chosen such as to provide at least a double reflection mode of propagation .",
    "the final results obtained are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ mono_f ] , [ mono_3 ] and [ poli_f ] .",
    "the conditions for the simulation are : i ) a 1 kev point source and ii ) a cylindrical monocapillary 10 cm long with a radius of @xmath34 cm . in figs .",
    "[ mono_f ] and [ mono_f_ist ] a single central spot is present and four rings formed by the convergent rays related to the different reflection numbers ( compare figs .",
    "[ mono_f ] and [ fig_ref_ter ] ) .    in figs .",
    "[ mono_3 ] and [ mono_3_ist ] many sharp rings are present .",
    "the central ring is given by the x - ray photons that cross the monocapillary without interacting with the surface .",
    "the second is formed by x - ray photons that hit , once at worst , the monocapillary inner surface .",
    "the third ring is due to x - rays that produce only one reflection with the channel .",
    "the fourth ring is due to x - rays that make one or two reflections .",
    "finally the outer ring is formed by ray vectors that undergo only two reflections .      in the case of a _ cylindrical polycapillary",
    "_ the simulation parameters are i ) a 1 kev point source ; ii ) a polycapillary 10 cm long with a radius of @xmath35 cm ; iii ) a single - channel radius of @xmath36 cm .    looking at fig .",
    "[ poli_f ] , for this configuration it is possible to observe a slightly bigger spot in the center , while the point density distribution of the halo decreases going from the center to the periphery .",
    "this last effect is due to the fact that each x - ray photon interacts many times with the channel surface and the number of interactions increases going from the center to the periphery .      as the next step we will consider a conical capillary with an x - ray point source located at finite distance . even though the amplitude of the incident angle @xmath25 can be chosen in a random way from zero to any prefixed value , in order to maximize the number of incoming photons that undergo total external reflection the following relation should be satisfied : @xmath37 , where @xmath27 is the semi - opening angle of the cone .",
    "it is not a simple job to define the focal plane for a conical capillary because each photon after each interaction with the channel surface undergoes a number of reflections with increasing incidence angular values : @xmath38 , @xmath39 ,  etc . , according to the different directions of the incident rays .",
    "taking this into account we decided to choose the position of the focal plane by minimizing the divergence of the exit beam . to compare the results of the conical and cylindrical capillaries , we again chose x - ray photons that undergo at least two reflections .",
    "the parameters of the conical monocapillary are similar to the cylindrical , i.e. , i ) the capillary length is 10 cm ; ii ) the entrance radius @xmath40 cm , while the exit radius is @xmath41 cm ; iii ) the energy of the photon is still 1 kev .    as for the cylindrical capillary ,",
    "simulations of the focal and out - of - focus radiation distributions are shown in figs .",
    "[ mono_con_f ] , [ mono_con_3 ] for the _ conical monocapillary_.      for a _ conical polycapillary _ the simulation results are shown in fig . [ poli_con ] .",
    "the parameters are : i ) a 1 kev point source ; ii ) a polycapillary 10 cm long with the entering radius of @xmath42 cm , while the exit radius is @xmath43 cm ; iii ) a single - channel radius of @xmath36 cm and @xmath44 cm , respectively for the entering and the exit plane .    in a following paper",
    "we will discuss in more detail the differences between conical and cylindrical capillaries .",
    "in particular we will show that the conical capillary has a more intense central spot and also a bigger halo .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the problem of an x - ray source located off - axis",
    ". the point source can be located at finite or at infinite distance from the capillary , so the behavior of a _ cylindrical monocapillary _ system differs accordingly ( figs .",
    "[ mono_off ] and [ mono_para ] ) .",
    "figure [ mono_off ] shows a simulation of a cylindrical monocapillary with a point source that is not placed along the z - axis , with coordinates : @xmath45 cm .",
    "the other physical parameters are capillary length = 10 cm , capillary radius = @xmath46 cm .",
    "we would like to point out that in this configuration the image has a symmetric shape with respect to an ideal line , which has a @xmath47 angular inclination due to the mirror - like behavior of each half of the channel .",
    "a large circular halo is also present , due to all the photons that cross the capillary without any interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ mono_para ] the situation is completely different because the point source is again located off - axis but at an infinite distance from the capillary .",
    "the zenithal and equatorial angles of the beam are respectively @xmath48 , while the channel parameters are , as usual , length = 10 cm , radius = @xmath46 cm .",
    "this configuration means that some parts of the internal channel surface can not be reached by x - ray photons , so now certain regions in the image are completely empty .",
    "it is essential to emphasize that the zenithal angle is so large that many regions of the capillary wall will not be active for x - ray propagation .",
    "the power of polycad program is that it can deal with any geometrical and optical configuration .",
    "it means that we may easily simulate the behavior of a source of finite dimensions like , for example , conventional x - ray tube . in order to treat this situation an offset for a single point - source",
    "is introduced in the program . in such a mode",
    "a finite area source can be simulated by random distribution of points inside a specific area .",
    "as practical application let to consider a ` long fine focus ' of x - ray tube ( for instance , a cu anode , @xmath49 ) , where the electron spot on the anticathode has the dimension of @xmath50 .",
    "such kind of tube allows us to have both an ` optical point - focus ' ( fig .",
    "[ point ] ) and an ` optical line - focus ' ( fig .",
    "[ line ] ) , where in these simulations we used _",
    "cylindrical polycapillary optics_. the source dimensions are respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in this paper we have reported the first part of a _ polycad _ program designed for capillary optics .",
    "using the ray optics approximation in the ideal case of total external reflection , i.e. , without absorption effects by the optical channel walls , this algorithm allows us to i ) simulate the passage of the x - ray beam inside the capillary channels for sources of different shapes , ii ) visualize the spot images formed on a screen at different distances from the optics .    after a description of the theoretical basis and of the computational details , we reported the numerical analysis for various source - optics configurations . in the case of a cylindrical monocapillary , we found good agreement with previous results@xcite , both for single and for multiple reflection modes .",
    "we would like to point out that this code can accurately describe the radiation distribution behind the optics , as shown in figs .",
    "[ mono_f_ist ] and [ mono_3_ist ] .",
    "when the source is located along the axis of the capillary , and in particular taking into account a single channel , photons are present in all the image areas ; however it is clear that by changing the source - optics conditions , the photons could be absent in some areas .    at present",
    "we are working on increasing the _ polycad _ program capabilities to deal with other polycapillary - optics shapes , such as semi - lenses and full - lenses .",
    "however , to understand the fine features of x - ray propagation through polycapillary lenses it is mandatory to consider the x - ray wave interaction with the inner capillary surface ( see details in the review@xcite ) .",
