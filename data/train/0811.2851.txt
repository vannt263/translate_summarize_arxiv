    "@xcite provides a supersymmetric regularization of the two - dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) sym from four to two dimensions and hence a four - dimensional notation is useful ; roman indices  @xmath5 and @xmath6 run over 0 , 1 , 2 and  3 , while greek indices  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 below run over only 0 and  1 . with the dimensional reduction",
    ", it is understood that @xmath9 and  @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is a four - component spinor .",
    "we follow the notational convention in  ref .",
    "note that the gauge coupling  @xmath12 has the mass dimension  1 . ]",
    "@xmath13 when one supplements to @xmath14 a supersymmetry breaking scalar mass term @xmath15 the scalar mass term was added to suppress a possible large amplitude of scalar fields along flat directions that may amplify @xmath16  lattice artifacts to  @xmath17  @xcite . in the present letter",
    ", we illustrate some physical application of this lattice formulation for the system  @xmath18 .",
    "assuming the t  hooft anomaly matching condition , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the two - dimensional @xmath0 sym has no mass gap .",
    "this aspect has been numerically investigated from almost a decade ago  @xcite by utilizing the supersymmetric discretized light - cone formulation  @xcite . in this super - renormalizable system , it is in fact possible to determine ( to all orders of perturbation theory ) an explicit form of a correlation function between noether currents , by employing anomalous ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities ( i.e. the kac - moody algebra )  @xcite ; this explicit form directly proves the above assertion . here , rather than supersymmetry , continuous global ( bosonic )",
    "symmetries are important and the proof  @xcite applies even with supersymmetry breaking scalar mass term  ( [ two ] ) .",
    "the total action  @xmath18 is invariant under the ( two - dimensional ) @xmath19 transformation , @xmath20 , and an associated noether current ( @xmath19 current ) is given by @xmath21 similarly , associated with the @xmath22 symmetry , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , there is a noether current ( @xmath22 current ) , @xmath26 it is then possible to show that  @xcite , for the two - dimensional euclidean space  @xmath27 , @xmath28 to all orders of perturbation theory , where @xmath29 is the number of colors and the constant  @xmath30 is a regularization ambiguity in a divergent one - loop diagram .",
    "thus the correlation function between the @xmath19 current and the @xmath22 current possesses a massless pole and this is precisely what the t  hooft anomaly matching condition claims for this two - dimensional system .",
    "we want to confirm the power - like behavior of correlation function in  eq .",
    "( [ five ] ) by using a lattice monte carlo simulation .",
    "for this , we prepared sets of uncorrelated configurations listed in  table  [ table:1 ] . for simulation details , see refs .  @xcite . in the table , @xmath31 denotes the lattice spacing and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are temporal and spatial physical sizes of our lattice , respectively .",
    "the scalar mass squared is @xmath34 for all cases .",
    "the temporal boundary condition for fermionic variables is antiperiodic as in  ref .",
    "@xcite . for current operator  ( [ four ] ) , we discretized the covariant derivatives @xmath35 and  @xmath36 by using the forward covariant lattice difference .",
    "( [ five ] ) suggests that we should not take an average of the correlation function over the spatial coordinate  @xmath37 ( i.e. , projection to the zero spatial momentum ) because after the average , correlation function  ( [ five ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath38 that can not be distinguished from the regularization ambiguity ; we should measure the correlation function as it stands without the zero spatial momentum projection .",
    ".sets of uncorrelated configurations used for figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the scalar mass squared is @xmath34 for all cases .",

    "[ fig:5 ] .     determined by linear @xmath39-fit described in the text .",
    "we used the configuration sets in  table  [ table:3 ] and , for @xmath34 , set  vi of  table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "( [ twelve ] ) with @xmath40 is plotted by the broken line . ]    for both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we still see a linear potential , although the string tension appears somewhat smaller for smaller @xmath43 . in  fig  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "for this case , the compton wavelength of a ( free ) scalar particle is @xmath44 and this is several times longer than the physical lattice size .",
    "thus in this case the scalar field could effectively be regarded as massless and the points  @xmath45 might be regarded as those for the two - dimensional @xmath0 sym . ] in the figure , just for reference , we also plotted the function @xmath46 with @xmath40 , that is given by a semi - classical analysis of a bosonized version of the two - dimensional massless qcd  @xcite . strictly speaking , the overall proportionality constant is not determined by this analysis and we have chosen it as above without any special reason .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is simply a result with a single lattice spacing and a single lattice size .",
    "it is thus not clear what is the real behavior in the continuum and the large volume limits .",
    "our result is still preliminary and a further detailed numerical study is needed .",
    "in this letter , we illustrated some numerical use of the lattice formulation  @xcite of the two - dimensional @xmath0 sym with a ( small ) supersymmetry breaking scalar mass .",
    "two physical problems were considered .",
    "for the first one  ( sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) , our monte carlo result fairly reproduced theoretical prediction on the basis of global symmetries and ( approximate ) supersymmetry in the continuum theory . for the second one  ( sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] ) , our result for the static potential  @xmath2 did not exhibit the screening behavior that theoretically anticipated .",
    "however , since our result of  @xmath2 was limited for @xmath47 , it is desirable to carry out a further systematic study by using finer and larger lattices .",
    "we would like to thank koji hashimoto and daisuke kadoh for helpful discussions .",
    "we thank also the authors of the fermiqcd / mdp  @xcite and of a remez algorithm code  @xcite for making their codes available .",
