    "this contribution corresponds to the summary talk given at dis97 on diffractive @xmath1 scattering .",
    "it is written as a mainly qualitative summary of the results and their interpretations as presented at the workshop .",
    "it is best read in conjunction with@xcite , which contains the other half of the summary from the diffractive sessions .",
    "the sessions were concerned with the phenomenological understanding of semi - inclusive experimental data that can be summarised by the two closely related diagrams shown in figure  [ prn2:diagrams ] . in the first type of analysis ( figure  [ prn2:diagrams]a ) , events containing large gaps in the rapidity distributions of final state hadrons",
    "are studied .",
    "the hadronic final state is divided into two systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that a colour singlet exchange coupling to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 vertices can be defined .",
    "most of the results presented were concerned with the case where the system @xmath3 is dominantly a proton . where the system @xmath2 is a bound state vector meson , the process is considered elastic at the photon vertex .",
    "dissociation processes correspond to the cases where one or both of the invariant masses @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the two final state systems is large . the processes studied can not automatically be considered to be diffractive in the sense of the exchange of the leading vacuum singularity .",
    "it is also important to understand the role played by non - diffractive processes in the hadron level cross sections measured .",
    "in addition to the conventional kinematic variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 used to discuss inclusive @xmath1 interactions , the following variables are also used here : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 are respectively the four - vectors of the incoming photon , incoming proton and outgoing system @xmath3 in the framework of figure  [ prn2:diagrams]a .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is the squared four - momentum transferred at the proton vertex , @xmath0 is the fraction of the proton beam momentum transferred to the longitudinal momentum of the colour singlet exchange and @xmath16 ( used only in the dis regime ) is the fraction of the colour singlet exchange 4-momentum that is carried by the quark coupling to the photon . in the large rapidity gap analyses presented , the system @xmath3 generally passes unobserved down the beam - pipe such that @xmath7 is constrained to be small . with the exception of vector meson production , the value of @xmath15 is not measured .",
    "the analyses are performed in the kinematic region in which @xmath6 is well reconstructed by direct measurement .",
    "the relations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are generally used to reconstruct the remaining kinematic variables .",

    "this approach has the advantage that the system @xmath3 is constrained to be a single state , but also results in a reduction in statistics and kinematic range by comparison with rapidity gap analyses .",
    "a semi - inclusive cross section can be defined differentially in @xmath19 throughout the range @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the incoming proton beam energy . where @xmath22 , the process is essentially that of figure  [ prn2:diagrams]a in the limit in which the system @xmath3 is a nucleon .",
    "all of the kinematic variables defined above apply equally well in both approaches . for the leading baryon measurements ,",

    "measurements were presented by both h1 and zeus of the semi - inclusive dis interaction @xmath24 and the corresponding photoproduction process @xmath25 .",
    "the mass of the system @xmath3 is constrained to be as small as possible such that the data samples are dominated by the single dissociation process in which @xmath3 is a single proton .    in the h1 case , the dis results are measured using the rapidity gap method in the kinematic range @xmath26 and @xmath27@xcite .",

    "there is no evidence of any need for a @xmath9 dependence in the present kinematic range of the measurement .",
    "this breaking of factorisation in the measured cross section may be explained naturally without the need for a @xmath37 dependent intercept by introducing a second trajectory with lower intercept .",

    "the third method employed by zeus@xcite is based on the fact that different exchanges give rise to different @xmath6 distributions at fixed @xmath11 and @xmath9 . in bins of @xmath11 and @xmath9 ,",

    "this is similar to a triple regge model ( see below ) with a triple pomeron contribution and a single effective non - diffractive term .",
    "the pomeron intercept is extracted from the @xmath11 dependence of the diffractive contribution @xmath57 at fixed @xmath9 .",
    "the results , shown in figure  [ prn : zeusalphapom ] , give an indication of a @xmath9 dependence of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "however , the uncertainties are large and when the zeus data are compared with the @xmath60 error band on the h1 result ( dashed lines ) , the two experiments are found to be in reasonable agreement .",
    "comparisons on a point by point basis between the zeus results obtained in the mass subtraction and leading proton measurements@xcite do not reveal any large differences beyond those expected from the proton dissociative contribution .",

    "the lowest order process by which a gluon can couple to the photon is the @xmath97 boson - gluon fusion process ( figure  [ prn : partons]b ) .",

    "several final state analyses were presented by h1 and zeus which corroborate the conclusion from the qcd analysis of the inclusive cross section ( section  [ prn : pdfs ] ) that the pomeron in hard diffractive scattering must contain a large fraction of gluons with large @xmath92 .",
    "if the pomeron consists dominantly of quarks and the total diffractive cross section is dominated by the qpm process , large momenta transverse to the @xmath98 axis are expected to arise at highest order from the @xmath99 suppressed qcd - compton process ( e.g. figure  [ prn : partons]c ) .",
    "other sources , such as intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in the pomeron are expected to be small . by contrast , in the boson - gluon fusion process , the quark propagator can be highly virtual , giving rise to substantial high @xmath100 particle production and energy flow in the central rapidity region of the @xmath98 centre of mass frame .",

    "there is considerable sensitivity to the difference between the rg - qg and rg - q simulations , with a good description being obtained with the leading gluon parton distributions in either fragmentation scheme .",

    "the pomeron and photon hemispheres are found to be rather symmetric in the @xmath101 distribution , as can also be see from the energy flow distributions .",
    "this behaviour is well described by the rg - qg models and is to be expected in the scenario where the pomeron parton distributions are dominated by gluons carrying large @xmath92 .",

    "the symmetry between the two hemispheres in the diffractive data is in marked contrast with the inclusive dis data , where there is an extended proton remnant , leading to an enhancement in the @xmath101 distribution in the proton fragmentation region .",
    "if dglap is appropriate for describing the evolution of diffractive parton distributions , a remnant would be expected to become increasingly visible with increasing @xmath9 ( compare figures  [ prn : pdf]a and b ) .",

    "similar conclusions are obtained in analyses of event shapes .",

    "both experiments find that the final state system @xmath2 becomes increasingly collimated along the @xmath98 axis as @xmath6 increases , consistent with a dominant two jet - like configuration with hadronisation effects broadening the jet structures .",

    "both the distribution in momentum of the thrust jets transverse to the @xmath98 axis and the mean particle momentum transverse to this axis show a significant tail to large values , indicating the need for substantial contributions from final states containing more than two partons .",

    "it is clear that the long range correlations between hadrons in the two hemispheres is greater in the diffractive data than is the case in @xmath106 data at similar centre of mass energy , demonstrating that the colour connections between partons are more complex in the diffractive case .",
    "again , this indicates@xcite that the lowest order process does not result in a final state quite as simple as @xmath107 .",

    "analysis of inclusive dis data@xcite supports the hypothesis that the charm contribution to the proton structure function is dominated by boson - gluon fusion and shows that above threshold , production rates are large . for a quark induced hard process , charm can only be produced from any intrinsic charm content of the pomeron .",
    "both zeus@xcite and h1@xcite measure @xmath108 cross sections that are consistent with those predicted in gluon based monte carlo models .",
    "they are inconsistent at the @xmath109 level or greater with quark based models that do not include intrinsic charm in the pomeron sea , though in some models@xcite the pomeron parton distributions contain significant charm .",

    "if the pomeron structure is dominated by gluons , the boson - gluon fusion process dominates the cross section .",

    "the photoproduction of light vector mesons continues to be well described by soft pomeron exchange in conjunction with the vector dominance model@xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath43 photoproduction@xcite matches parameterisations@xcite based on other soft physics data well .",
    "results obtained by zeus for @xmath136@xcite and @xmath44@xcite photoproduction are also consistent with this behaviour .",
    "shrinkage of the forward elastic peak in @xmath43 photoproduction now seems to be established , with zeus measuring @xmath140 from the difference in slope parameters measured at hera and at lower energy@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the figure established from @xmath123 elastic scattering@xcite .",
    "shrinkage seems also to be present in the low @xmath9 electroproduction regime@xcite .",
    "a clear message from the workshop was that wherever a large scale ( @xmath9 , @xmath15 or a heavy quark mass ) is introduced , the soft physics description breaks down , with perturbative approaches being more appropriate . under these circumstances , @xmath11",
    "dependences steepen , @xmath15-slope parameters fall and the skewing of the @xmath43 line - shape diminishes .",
    "it is now clearly established from hera data alone that the @xmath11 dependence of the @xmath137 photoproduction cross section is significantly steeper than that predicted from soft pomeron models@xcite .",
    "perturbative calculations@xcite that predict the @xmath11 dependence of the cross section from the square of the proton gluon density are in broad agreement with the data .",
    "it is not yet established whether there is any shrinkage in the forward elastic peak for @xmath137 photoproduction .",
    "the skewing of the @xmath141 line - shape , usually interpreted as the result of interference between resonant and non - resonant di - pion production@xcite becomes less significant with increasing @xmath15@xcite ( see figure  [ prn : vmfigs]a ) as well as @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the @xmath142 and @xmath143 ratios also increase with both of these scales@xcite .",

    "however , the new results from e665@xcite show a larger cross section at low energy , yielding a @xmath11 dependence that is still compatible with the soft pomeron .",
    "the difference between the low energy measurements is likely to be at least in part related to the assumptions made regarding proton dissociation background@xcite . with the present experimental precision ,",
    "it is not possible to reslolve this question using hera data alone .",
    "the @xmath15-slope parameter for @xmath43 production clearly falls with increasing @xmath9 at fixed @xmath11@xcite , as expected from the decrease in transverse separation of @xmath107 components of the photon with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "there is also a clear decrease in slope parameters when the proton - dissociative @xmath43 production process is compared with its elastic counterpart , both in photoproduction@xcite and at high @xmath9@xcite .",
    "this reflects a similar behaviour in @xmath123 interactions@xcite . for the @xmath137 ,",
    "the slope parameter is already significantly smaller than that for the @xmath43 in the photoproduction regime .",
    "results on @xmath137 electroproduction@xcite do not indicate any differences in the @xmath11 or @xmath15 dependences compared to those at @xmath144 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the total cross section for vector meson production is fitted to the form @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the vector meson mass . in the vector dominance model",
    "@xmath147 is expected@xcite .",
    "the results for both the @xmath43 ( see figure  [ prn : vmfigs]b ) and the @xmath137@xcite are found to lie in the region @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of the vector meson polarisation has now been extensively studied , through the distributions in the angle @xmath149 in the rest frame of the @xmath43 between the direction of the positively charged decay pion and the @xmath43 direction in the @xmath150 centre of mass frame . in photoproduction ,",
    "both the @xmath43 and @xmath137 are consistent with full transverse polarisation@xcite , as expected from @xmath151-channel helicity conservation . at large @xmath9 ,",
    "the transition to a dominantly longitudinal vector meson polarisation is rather rapid , as can be seen from the change in the @xmath152 distribution as measured by e665 ( figure  [ prn : vmfigs]c)@xcite .",
    "natural parity exchange and @xmath151-channel helicity conservation have been explicitly demonstrated from the large @xmath9 data@xcite using the methods of@xcite , such that the longitudinal to transverse photon cross section ratio @xmath153 can be extracted . a compilation of measurements of this ratio is shown in figure  [ prn : vmfigs]d .",
    "a final area of study is radial excitations of vector mesons .",
    "the @xmath154 photoproduction ratio is measured by h1 to be @xmath155@xcite , consistent with predictions based on the convolution of the @xmath156 and @xmath157 wavefunctions with the spatial separation of the diquarks in the process @xmath158@xcite .",
    "the @xmath159 ratio is larger at high @xmath9 than in photoproduction@xcite , as predicted in the same model .",
    "significant developments in colour - singlet exchange physics have taken place in the past year , both from an experimental and a phenomenological point of view .",
    "there is now agreement that the value of the intercept of the diffractive trajectory dominating the photon dissociation process at high @xmath9 is larger than that extracted in photoproduction or from soft hadron - hadron data .",
    "there is a consensus , arising both from inclusive measurements and from final state analyses , that the exchange mediating the diffractive process in dis invloves a gluon carrying a large fraction of the momentum at low scales .",
    "comparisons of parton distributions extracted from diffractive structure function analyses with dijet production rates both at hera and the tevatron have begun .",
    "there are already indications that incomplete rapidity gap survival probabilities may play an important role .",
    "cross section measurements for leading baryon production at large @xmath0 are developing fast and their description presents a considerable challenge to theorists . the new vector meson data map out the transition from the vector dominance to the perturbative region with increasing precision .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the speakers in the diffractive sessions for an excellent set of talks and the other conveners , dave soper , amadeo staiano and phillip melese , with whom i enjoyed working very much . due to the efforts of jose repond and his team , the workshop was extremely well organised .",
