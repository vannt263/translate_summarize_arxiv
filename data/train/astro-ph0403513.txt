    "the analysis of absorption lines in the local and distant intergalactic medium ( igm ) towards extragalactic background sources such as quasars ( qsos ) and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has become an important research area to investigate the gaseous environment of galaxies and galaxy - clusters , and to study the large scale structure , the chemical evolution and the baryonic content of the igm .",
    "the most sensitive tracer to follow the distribution and evolution of the igm from high to low redshifts is the ly@xmath11 line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "a large number of ly@xmath11 lines occur along a typical qso sight line , resulting in the `` ly@xmath11 forest '' ( e.g. , rauch 1998 ; lu et al.1996 ) . for the low - redshift universe ,",
    "the observation of intergalactic ly@xmath11 absorption requires space - based instrumentation , such as the former _ goddard high resolution spectrograph _ ( ghrs ) and",
    "the more recently deployed _",
    "space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) , both installed on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . for higher redshifts ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "ground based 8m - class telescopes such as keck and the _ very large telescope _ ( vlt )",
    "provide a wealth of information about the ly@xmath11 forest in the early universe ( e.g. , kim et al.2002 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that at @xmath28 almost all of the baryons in the universe are located in the highly - ionized ly@xmath11 forest ( rauch et al.1997 ; weinberg et al.1997 ) , whereas at lower redshifts an increasing fraction of the baryons may reside in a low - density , shock - heated component at temperatures between @xmath29 to @xmath30 k , the so - called warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) . in the local universe ( i.e. , near @xmath31 )",
    ", the whim may contain as much as 30 to 40 percent of the baryons ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the ly@xmath11 forest at @xmath31 probably contains about 20 percent of the baryons ( penton , shull & stocke 2000 ) .",
    "detecting the whim phase at low redshifts is a challenging task .",
    "absorption spectroscopy of the ovi doublet ( @xmath32 ) currently provides one of the best diagnostics to study the warm phase ( @xmath33 k ) of the whim at low redshift .",
    "however , observing ovi in the low - redshift igm requires space - based high - resolution spectrographs such as stis and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) together with a substantial amount of observing time ( e.g. , tripp , savage & jenkins 2000 ; savage et al.2002 ) . due to these instrumental restrictions ,",
    "the number of sight - lines that have been analyzed for ovi absorption at @xmath34 unfortunately is still very limited .",
    "so far , intervening whim ovi absorption for @xmath34 in fuse and stis data has been found towards h1821 + 643 ( tripp , savage & jenkins 2000 ; oegerle et al.2000 ) , pg0953 + 415 ( tripp & savage 2000 ; savage et al.2002 ) , and pks0405@xmath35123 ( chen & prochaska 2000 ) .",
    "together with the non - detections or marginal and weak detections reported for the sight lines towards pg0804 + 761 ( richter et al.2001a ) and 3c273 ( sembach et al.2001 ) , the current data imply a number of intervening ovi absorbers per unit redshift of @xmath36 for restframe equivalent widths @xmath37 m at @xmath38 ( savage et al.2002 ) . assuming that the average metallicity of these absorbers is 0.1 solar , the cosmological mass density in the units of the current critical density is @xmath39ovi@xmath40 .",
    "clearly , additional observations with fuse and stis are desired to improve the statistics on the intervening ovi absorbers , and to gain new insights about their physical properties ( e.g. , their ionization properties ) and their metal abundances .",
    "for those absorbers that can not be detected in ovi absorption ( e.g. , if the overall column density is too low , the metallicity is too low , or the temperature is too high ) , other tracers have to be used to study the warm - hot intergalactic gas phase .",
    "x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. , rasmussen , kahn , & paerels 2003 ; fang et al.2002 ) hold the prospect of improving our understanding of the distribution and physical properties for the million - degree phase of the whim , which may contain the dominating fraction of the baryons at low redshifts . however , detecting x - ray signatures such as ovii and oviii absorption from the low - redshift igm is difficult with current instrumentation , and so far the information about the intergalactic x - ray forest is relatively sparse . for high - metallicity , high - column density absorbers ,",
    "one may search for fuv absorption by neviii @xmath41 .",
    "but due to the relatively low cosmic abundance of ne , neviii is not expected to be a sensitive tracer for the whim in the low - redshift universe . a promising approach to study",
    "the whim at low redshifts is to search for broad ly@xmath11 lines . for pure thermal broadening , ly@xmath11 absorbers with doppler parameters exceeding @xmath42 kms@xmath4 sample whim gas with temperatures @xmath43 k. there are some compelling detections of broad ly@xmath11 lines at low redshifts ( e.g. , tripp et al.2001 ) , but generally broad ly@xmath11 lines are difficult to identify and analyze due to continuum placement uncertainties , line - blending problems , and relatively low signal - to - noise ratios in existing data .    in this paper",
    "we investigate intervening intergalactic absorption by hi , ovi and other species with fuse and stis in direction of the bright qso pg1259 + 593 ( @xmath44 ; @xmath0 ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "fuse and stis data of pg1259 + 593 have been extensively used to study abundances and physical conditions in galactic halo gas in this direction ( richter et al.2001b ; collins , shull & giroux 2003 ; sembach et al.2004 ; fox et al.2004 ) . with more than @xmath47 ks of integration time it represents one of the prime objects of the fuse mission .",

    "the goal of this paper is to present an overview of the intergalactic absorption towards pg1259 + 593 , to identify the main absorption systems , to perform a first , basic analysis of these absorbers , and to search for the whim absorbers that may contain an important fraction of the baryonic mass in the low - redshift universe .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in  2 we review the observations and the data reduction process .",
    "the analysis of intergalactic absorption is presented in  3 . in ",
    "3 we also describe the properties of the individual absorption systems and derive statistical information about the igm towards pg1259 + 593 .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 and summarize our study in  5 .",
    "fuse observations of pg1259 + 593 were carried out between february 2000 and march 2001 in various individual observation - runs . for a detailed description about the fuse instrument and its performance in space",
    "see moos et al.(2000 ) and sahnow et al.(2000 ) .",
    "table 1 provides basic information about the individual fuse data sets .",
    "pg1259 + 593 was observed through the large ( lwrs , @xmath48 ) aperture in the photon - address mode , which stores x / y location , arrival time , and pulse - height of each detection as a photon list .",
    "the 236 exposures of pg1259 + 593 provide a total of @xmath49 ks of integration time .",
    "the raw data were processed with the standard fuse reduction pipeline ( calfuse v2.2.2 ) .",
    "extra care was taken to screen the raw data for possible particle event bursts , earth limb avoidance , south atlantic anomaly passage , and pulse height distribution constraints .",
    "summed exposure lists for each of the four fuse channels ( lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , sic2 ) were created and corrected for geometric distortions , doppler shifts , grating motions , astigmatism , detector backgrounds , and scattered light effects .",
    "the data were further flux calibrated and wavelength calibrated to a heliocentric velocity scale . the zero point of the fuse wavelength scale was adjusted to that of the ( more accurate ) stis wavelength scale by comparing the velocity scale of narrow interstellar absorption lines from atomic species such as feii and siii in both the fuse and the stis wavelength range ( see sembach et al.2004 for details ) .",
    "the average flux in the fuse spectrum , which covers the wavelength range between 905 and 1187  , is @xmath50 erg@xmath24s@xmath4 @xmath4 .",
    "note that the current fuse flux calibration for pg1259 + 593 does not account for the occurrence of dark horizontal stripes in the detector images that reduce the total flux in specific wavelength regions ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution in the fuse data is @xmath51 kms@xmath4 at a rebinned pixel size of @xmath52 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the night+day fuse data of pg1259 + 593 data varies between @xmath53 and @xmath54 per spectral resolution element . a more detailed description of the fuse data reduction of pg1259 + 593 is provided in sembach et al.(2004 ) .",
    "stis observations of pg1259 + 593 were obtained in january and december 2001 ( see table 1 ) using the intermediate - resolution ( fwhm@xmath6 kms@xmath4 ) echelle far - uv grating ( e140 m ) and the @xmath55 slit .",
    "the stis data cover the wavelength range between @xmath56 and @xmath57  with small gaps between the echelle orders at wavelengths @xmath58  .",
    "the pixel size in the data is @xmath59 kms@xmath4 .",
    "detailed information about the stis instrument is provided by woodgate et al.(1998 ) , kimble et al.(1998 ) and leitherer et al.(2002 ) .",
    "the pg1259 + 593 stis data were reduced following the individual steps described by tripp et al.(2001 ) .",
    "the data reduction includes a two - dimensional scattered light correction ( landsman & bowers 1997 ; bowers et al.1998 ) .",
    "individual extracted flux - calibrated spectra were co - added together ( weighted by their inverse variances averaged over a large region of the spectrum ) to produce the final composite spectrum in a heliocentric velocity scale .",
    "hot pixels that occasionally occur in the calibrated stis data have been corrected for by interpolating between adjacent pixels .",
    "the resulting s / n per resolution element in the stis data varies between @xmath6 and @xmath60 .",
    "the highest s / n region in the stis data occurs near @xmath61  .      the combined fuse and stis spectrum of pg1259 + 593 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "more than 200 absorption features are seen in the fuse and stis data of pg1259 + 593 ; these features are identified in figs.2@xmath3512 .",
    "wavelengths and oscillator strengths ( @xmath62 values ) have been adopted from the compilations of morton ( 2003 , 1991 ) and verner et al.(1994 ) ; they are listed in table 2 . since both resolution and s / n is varying along the spectrum , typical @xmath63 detection limits range from @xmath64 to @xmath65 m . in a first step",
    "we have separated intergalactic absorption lines from local foreground absorption by the interstellar medium in the disk and halo of the milky way . the interstellar spectrum ( fuse and stis ) in the direction of pg1259 + 593 is discussed in detail by richter et al.(2001b ) and sembach et al.(2004 ) .",
    "interstellar absorption consists of three main velocity components located near @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 kms@xmath4 ( sembach et al.2004 ) , representing local milky way disk gas , gas from the intermediate velocity arch ( iv arch ) , and gas from high - velocity cloud complex c , respectively ( note that @xmath69 kms@xmath4 in this direction ) .",
    "each of these velocity components have to be considered carefully for possible blending problems with intergalactic absorption .",
    "stronger interstellar absorption features ( with equivalent widths @xmath70 m , typically ) have been marked with star symbols in the spectrum plots of pg1259 + 593 in figs.2@xmath3512 . after dealing with the interstellar absorption features , we have identified 135 intergalactic absorption lines from 78 individual absorption components in 72 different absorption systems ( see next section for details ) .",
    "we have measured wavelengths and redshifts by fitting voigt profiles ( convolved with gaussian instrumental profiles corresponding to the spectral resolution of the two instruments ; see  2.1 and  2.2 ) to the absorption lines .",
    "normalized velocity profiles have been created by fitting low - order polynomials to the ( generally slightly varying ) continuum flux of pg1259 + 593 and transforming each absorption profile into a restframe velocity scale .",
    "restframe equivalent widths , @xmath71 , have been measured for each line by a pixel integration over the normalized velocity profile .",
    "column densities have been derived by three different methods : if multiple lines from a species are available in a system ( e.g. , multiple hi lyman series lines ) , we have constructed curves of growth ( cog ) from the measured equivalent widths and derived logarithmic column densities , log @xmath22 , and doppler - parameters ( @xmath72 values ) . for these multi - line systems ,",
    "the various lyman series lines are located in both the higher - resolution stis wavelength band and the lower - resolution fuse regime , thus in regions where different instrumental line spread functions apply . here",
    ", the cog analysis ( which requires only the equivalent width for each line as input parameter ) represents a very robust method to determine column densities and @xmath72 values for this inhomogeneous set of absorption lines .",
    "moreover , the cog method allows to directly visualize the influence of outliers ( e.g. , lines that are partly blended ) for deriving log @xmath22 and @xmath72 for a multi - line system , and thus provides an important tool to estimate realistic uncertainties for these parameters . in some systems , we have fitted single lines from selected ions to curves of growth with @xmath72 values previously derived for other species . in addition , we have used the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method ( see savage & sembach 1991 for a detailed description ) in a number of cases to derive logarithmic column densities by integrating over the normalized velocity profiles of mostly unsaturated lines .",
    "finally , we have determined log @xmath22 and @xmath72 by voigt - profile fitting of high s / n igm lines located in the higher resolution stis wavelength range .",
    "this method was preferred to derive column densities and @xmath72 values for hi in the metal - line systems and the ly@xmath11 forest , except for those absorbers that consist of a large number of lyman series lines and for which the cog method was used .",
    "our measurements are compiled in tables @xmath14 .",
    "formal @xmath73 errors for @xmath71 , log @xmath22 , and @xmath72 are based on photon - statistics and continuum placement constraints .",
    "the combined use of the different methods for deriving @xmath22 allows to check upon the possible existence of systematic errors that can not be accounted for in the formal error estimate for each method .",
    "such possible systematic errors could be unexpected continuum undulations , unresolved and unidentified line blending , unknown instrumental features , and fixed - pattern noise .",
    "values for log @xmath22 derived by the different methods usually agree well within their formal @xmath74 error range ( see table 3 )",
    ". however , for the ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath12 forest lines a reliable identification and analysis of weak and broad absorption features is particularly difficult if such effects are present .",
    "in addition to the formal errors provided in tables 3 , 5 and 6 we therefore give an additional `` reliability status '' for those lines for which we see evidence that the estimates for log @xmath22 and @xmath72 ( and their formal errors ) could be incorrect due to one of the effects listed above .",
    "typical problematic cases are : stronger lines that show asymmetries or weak wings , weak lines that have unidentified features and undulations in the adjacent continuum , and apparently broad lines that show evidence that they are composed of several , unresolved sub - components . in table 3",
    "we flag those lines with the note `` uncertain '' in the last column .",
    "similarly , we list in the seventh column of table 5 the status of a ly@xmath11 forest line as either ok or uc ( uncertain ) .",
    "for the 135 intergalactic absorption lines detected towards pg1259 + 593 we have identified 72 corresponding absorption systems at redshifts between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that some of the identifications have to be considered as tentative due to the fact that some features have low s / n and/or they occur in regions where line blending problems do not allow unambiguous identifications .",
    "these lines have been marked with questions marks in figs.2@xmath3512 .",
    "six of the 72 systems consist of two sub - components each , so that the spectrum consists of 78 igm absorption components in total . for these sub - components ( in tables 3 , 4 and 5 given as `` component a '' and `` component b '' )",
    "we have measured column densites and @xmath72 values separately . of the identified 72 systems ,",
    "four to eight are metal line systems detected in one or more lines of ciii , civ , oiii , oiv , ovi , siiii , and possibly neviii .",
    "these systems will be discussed in detail in  3.2 .",
    "rest - frame equivalent widths , column densities , @xmath72 values , and other information for each system are listed in table 3 .",
    "table 4 summarizes the column densities of the metal - line absorbers ( note that all metal line systems detected towards pg1259 + 593 have hi column densities log @xmath22(hi)@xmath77 ) .",
    "fourteen additional absorption systems are detetected solely in hi in two or more lines from the lyman series ( ly@xmath78 ly@xmath79 ) , but without corresponding metal lines . also for these systems we list restframe equivalent widths , column densities , etc . in tables 3 and 4 , while their properties are discussed in  3.4 .",
    "finally , we find 50 absorbers detected only in one single line , which we generally assume to be ly@xmath11 .",
    "since the given wavelength limit ( @xmath80  ) does not allow us to detect ly@xmath11 absorption for redshifts @xmath81 , some of the lines between 1458 and 1516 identified as ly@xmath11 may be actually ly@xmath12 belonging to ly@xmath11 absorption outside the wavelength range of the stis data . without having additional high - resolution spectral data for @xmath82  , however , we are not able to clarify the line identification for this redshift range at this point . the ly@xmath11/ly@xmath12 forest is discussed in detail in  3.4 and  3.5 .",
    "redshifts , logarithmic hi column densities and @xmath72 values of the 50 systems seen solely in ly@xmath11 absorption are given in table 5 .",
    "there is a good qualitative match between the high - resolution stis data presented here and the low resolution ( fwhm@xmath83  ) fos data of pg1259 + 593 ( bahcall et al.1993 ) .",
    "bahcall et al.identified eight strong ly@xmath11 absorbers ( their table 6 ) along the total redshift path towards pg1259 + 593 .",
    "these identifications coincide with the absorption systems at @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 detected in the stis spectrum ( see table 4 ) .",
    "this system ( see fig.13 ) has the lowest redshift of all absorbers and is most likely related to the galaxy ugc08146 ( @xmath93 ; see also ",
    "the absorber is detected in ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath12 , and possibly in ovi @xmath94 .",
    "the ly@xmath11 absorption of this systems lies in the wing of the strong interstellar ly@xmath11 absorption and therefore has a relatively low s / n . a profile fit yields log @xmath22(hi)@xmath95 and @xmath96 kms@xmath4 .",
    "using the relation between the doppler parameter , @xmath72 , and the temperature , @xmath97 ,    @xmath98    ( with @xmath99 being the atomic weight for the element ) , this @xmath72 value corresponds to @xmath100 k. the temperature could be significantly lower than @xmath101 k if effects like turbulent gas motions , gas flows and unresolved sub - component structure contribute to the total breadth of the line . from measurements of doppler parameters . ]",
    "ovi @xmath94 absorption is possibly detected with log @xmath22(ovi)@xmath102 . using the formal error calculation ,",
    "the significance of the line is @xmath103 ( see  2.3 and table 3 ) ; however , the absorption appears to be exceptionally broad ( ranging from approximately @xmath104 to @xmath105 kms@xmath4 ) and we thus can not exclude that this feature is an unexpected continuum undulation rather than ovi at @xmath92 .",
    "we regard this case as a tentative intervening ovi detection .",
    "if the feature is produced by ovi , the absorption may have a multicomponent structure with the part of the absorption between @xmath106 and @xmath107 kms@xmath4 associated with the hi ly@xmath11 absorption , and the more extended absorption from @xmath107 to @xmath105 kms@xmath4 occurring where hi absorption is not detected .",
    "such multicomponent ovi and hi absorbers have been seen in stis spectra of the qso h1821 + 643 ( @xmath108 ) by tripp et al.(2000 ) .",
    "there is a possible hi absorption component near @xmath109 kms@xmath4 seen in ly@xmath11 , but its significance is low ( @xmath110 ) due to the low s /",
    "n in the vicinity of the ism ly@xmath11 absorption . at this radial velocity ,",
    "the feature would have @xmath111 or @xmath112 kms@xmath4 ( in the heliocentric velocity frame ) , and thus might correspond to gas located in the local group .",
    "unfortunately , possible ovi @xmath113 absorption at this velocity is totally blended by ly@xmath12 at @xmath114 ( see next subsection ) .",
    "the absorption system at @xmath114 ( see fig.13 ) is detected in hi ly@xmath11 , ly@xmath12 , and possibly ovi @xmath94 . from a profile fit of the ly@xmath11 absorption",
    "we obtain log @xmath22(hi)@xmath115 and @xmath116 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath72 value implies @xmath117 k ( see previous subsection ) .",
    "the ly@xmath11 absorption shows a wing at positive velocities , suggesting the presence of a weak second component near @xmath118 kms@xmath4 .",
    "weak ovi @xmath94 absorption is possibly detected in this system near @xmath119  at a column density of log @xmath120ovi@xmath121 ( aod method ) .",
    "the formal significance of this detection is @xmath122 for the lif1a channel and @xmath123 for the lif2b channel ( see table 3 ) .",
    "however , the absorption unfortunately occurs in a wavelength region of the fuse instrument where detector features are commonly observed ( in particular in the lif1a channel ) . with an equivalent width of @xmath124",
    "mfor the ovi @xmath94 line , no detectable absorption is expected ( and observed ) to occur in the weaker ovi @xmath125 line which could confirm the presence of ovi at @xmath114 . due to the very small equivalent width of the possible ovi absorption and the possible presence of detector features in the region where",
    "ovi at @xmath114 is expected we regard this system as a tentative intervening ovi absorber .",
    "this is one of the the two more complex metal - line systems towards pg1259 + 593 ( together with the system at @xmath126 ) .",
    "absorption is seen in the first eight lines of the hi lyman series ( ly@xmath11 to ly@xmath127 ) , and in ciii , siiii , civ , and ovi ( fig.14 and table 3 ) .",
    "a two - component structure is present ( see , for instance , the absorption profiles of hi ly@xmath12 and ciii ) , with the stronger component at @xmath128 kms@xmath4 in the @xmath84 restframe ( component a ) and the weaker one near @xmath129 kms@xmath4 ( component b ) .",
    "both components are present in hi ly@xmath78ly@xmath130 , ciii , and ovi @xmath94 , but for siiii and civ @xmath131 line blends hamper the analysis of the positive - velocity component .",
    "the profiles of the hi lines reveal internal substructure within component a. component b appears to be a combination of a narrow and broad absorption components . with an hi column density of log @xmath22(hi)@xmath132 and a @xmath72 value of @xmath133 kms@xmath4 ( from a curve - of - growth analysis ; see table 3 ) component a represents the strongest igm ly@xmath11 absorber along this sight line .",
    "having eight hi lines available in this system and a two - component structure that introduces significant uncertainties for the voigt - profile fitting , we prefer the curve - of - growth technique to obtain values for log @xmath22 and @xmath72 for the hi in this absorption system .",
    "the logarithmic column densities in component a for the two intermediate ions ciii and siiii are @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively ( aod method ) .",
    "the civ absorption ( log @xmath22(civ)@xmath136 ; aod ) appears to be quite narrow , and is offset towards positive velocities ( near @xmath137 kms@xmath4 ) compared to the low ions and the hi ( @xmath128 kms@xmath4 ) . note that unresolved saturation may possibly be affecting these ciii , siiii , and civ column density estimates .",
    "the ovi @xmath94 absorption in component a ( log @xmath22(ovi)@xmath138 ; aod ) is broader than the civ absorption and merges at positive velocities into an almost equally strong ovi absorption in component b ( see below ) .",
    "the ovi @xmath125 line unfortunately has very low s / n ( only the less sensitive sic1a channel is available for this line ; see fig.4 ) and thus does not provide any further information on the ovi absorption in either component a or component b. the @xmath72 value for the hi lyman series in component a ( @xmath139 kms@xmath4 ) suggests @xmath140 k. the presence of ciii , siiii , civ , and ovi absorption implies that component a is a multi - phase absorber , possibly having a cooler interior surrounded by a high - temperature envelope . due to the complexity of this system and",
    "the relatively low s / n in the data we refrain from performing a more detailed modelling of component a.    the hi column density for component b is log @xmath22(hi)@xmath141 ( cog ) , thus significantly lower than for component a. while the lines of siiii @xmath142 and civ @xmath131 are blended by other igm lines , ciii absorption is clearly present ( log @xmath22(ciii)@xmath143 ; aod method ) .",
    "also the somewhat noisy civ @xmath144 line shows a weak absorption component near @xmath129 kms@xmath4 .",
    "this feature , however , corresponds only to a @xmath145 significance , so that we only can place an upper limit of log @xmath22(civ)@xmath146 .",
    "ovi @xmath94 absorption in component b ( log @xmath22(ovi)@xmath147 ; aod ) is nearly as strong as in component a ( again , no significant absorption is seen in the much noisier ovi @xmath125 line ; see above ) .",
    "the values of @xmath120hi@xmath148ovi ) in components a and b are 135 and 8.5 , respectively .",
    "this ratio has been observed to range from @xmath149 to @xmath150 which suggests that although hi and ovi are observed to be coupled kinematically , the two species often arise in quite different gaseous phases ( shull 2003 ) .",
    "this is the second of the two more complex metal - line absorption systems ( the @xmath84 system being the other ) .",

    "redshifts , column densities and @xmath72 values for these systems ( as derived by using voigt - profile fitting ) are given in table 5 .",
    "we have given every ly@xmath11 line listed in table 5 a `` reliability flag '' ( table 5 , seventh column ) to indicate the reliability of the listed line parameters ( equivalent width , column density , doppler parameter ) for each line ( see  2.3 for details ) .",
    "including the eight metal - line systems discussed in the previous section , the line of sight towards pg1259 + 593 consists of 72 intervening intergalactic absorption line systems ( 78 absorption components ) , for which a short statistical analysis is presented in the following sections .",
    "the wavelength range for possible intergalactic ly@xmath11 absorption is @xmath321  ( @xmath322  , corresponding to @xmath323 ) , and there are 77 ly@xmath11 lines detected in this range .",
    "it is misleading , however , to derive the number of ly@xmath11 absorbers per unit redshift , @xmath324 , for this redshift range given the fact that the s / n in the stis data decreases significantly toward higher wavelengths , and some of the ly@xmath11 identifications thus are doubtful .",
    "a roughly constant s / n of @xmath325 per resolution element is provided for the range between 1218 and 1525 ( @xmath326 ) . in this range ,",
    "47 ly@xmath11 lines are seen above an limiting rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath327 m . for this sensitivity limit , we find @xmath328 for the sight line towards pg1259 + 593 , after applying a blocking correction of @xmath329 for strong ism lines to the above redshift path .",

    "recent studies ( e.g. , janknecht , baade & reimers 2002 ; kim et al.2002 ) suggest that a break in redshift evolution of the ly@xmath11 forest ( characterized by the power law @xmath330 ) appears at @xmath331 . for high - column density systems with @xmath332log",

    "the redshift evolution of the ly@xmath11 forest density usually is attributed to the combined ( counteracting ) effects of a decreasing ionizing background flux together with a decreasing gas density due to expansion of the universe .",
    "our data yields log @xmath341 for ly@xmath11 absorbers with @xmath342log @xmath343 and log @xmath344 for systems with @xmath345log @xmath346 in our selected redshift range @xmath347 , thus consistent with the previous low redshift data ( weymann et al.1998 ; penton , shull & stocke 2000 ) .",
    "interestingly , there is no absorber directly associated with the quasar pg1259 + 593 itself .",
    "while the ly@xmath11 line at or near @xmath348 lies outside the stis range studied here , intrinsic ly@xmath12 absorption would be expected near @xmath349  , but no absorption is seen around this wavelength ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "the closest igm line bluewards is at @xmath350 , which we identify as ly@xmath11 @xmath351 ( see table 5 ) .",
    "if this line would be intrinsic ly@xmath12 rather than intervening ly@xmath11 , it would already be more than @xmath352 kms@xmath4 away from the quasar .",
    "also the low - resolution fos data of pg1259 + 593 ( bahcall et al.1993 ) show no evidence for a signficant absorption line near @xmath353  where intrinsic ly@xmath11 absorption would be expected . a broad ly@xmath11 emission from the qso itself , however , is clearly seen at this wavelength ( bahcall et al.1993 ) .      fig.22 , upper left panel , shows the number distribution of @xmath72 values for the absorbers ( and their sub - components ) , given in @xmath53 kms@xmath4 wide bins .",
    "the distribution plotted with the thin line represents the number distribution of all absorption components for which @xmath72 values have been measured ; the distribution plotted with the thick line shows the number distribution of @xmath72 values excluding the cases that are flagged as `` uncertain '' ( uc ; see tables 3 , 5 and  2.3 ) . the distribution of @xmath72 values peaks around @xmath354 kms@xmath4 , very similar to what is found in the larger hst sample presented by penton , shull & stocke ( 2000 ) .",
    "the distribution shows a wing towards higher @xmath72 values .",
    "this wing extends to @xmath150 kms@xmath4 in the distribution of the more reliable @xmath72 values ( thick line ) , and to @xmath355 km@xmath4 for the total sample ( thin line ) .",
    "most of the high @xmath72 values with @xmath356 kms@xmath4 most likely are caused by unresolved sub - component structure in lines , continuum undulations , and other effects that may produce broad spectral features .",
    "thus , part of the wing feature in the @xmath72 value distribution certainly is artificial in nature ( see also discussion in penton , shull & stocke , 2000 ) . however , there are seven lines with @xmath357 kms@xmath4 that do not show evidence that such effects are responsible for the large breadth of the line .",
    "these lines thus may represent intrinsically broad ly@xmath11 absorbers ; they will be discussed below .",
    "examples for voigt profiles fitted to broad ly@xmath11 absorbers are presented in figs.23 and 24 .    in the upper right panel of fig.22",
    "we have plotted the distribution of column densities for the 78 absorption components , divided into bins of @xmath358 for log @xmath22(hi ) , starting at log @xmath22(hi@xmath359 .",
    "similar to the @xmath72 value distribution , the thin line shows the distribution for log @xmath22 for the total sample , whereas the thick line shows the log @xmath22 distribution excluding the uncertain cases .",
    "this distribution has its maxiumum in the range between log @xmath22(hi)@xmath360 .",
    "note that the determination of log @xmath22(hi ) depends on the adopted @xmath72 value for each individual system . at the same equivalent width , a lower @xmath72 value would result in a higher column density .",
    "therefore , the distribution of column densities and the distribution of @xmath72 values are coupled by the curve - of - growth analysis ( thus by the voigt function ) .",
    "the observed distribution indicates a peak at column densities slightly higher than found in the sample by penton , shull & stocke ( 2000 ) , although the @xmath72 value distribution is very similar .    in the lower panel of fig.22 we have plotted doppler parameters versus logarithmic column densities .",
    "systems for which @xmath72 values and column densities can be reliably determined ( status is ok ) are shown as filled circles ; systems for which the values of log @xmath22 and @xmath72 are uncertain ( status uc ) are are shown as open circles .",
    "most of the data points with @xmath361 kms@xmath4 follow the trend for a small increase of the @xmath72 values with significantly increasing column densities .",
    "such a trend is expected assuming that the higher column - density absorbers arise from clouds that have higher volume densities and higher temperatures ( e.g. , dav & tripp 2001 ) .",
    "there appears to be , however , a second branch in this plot for @xmath362 kms@xmath4 , indicating absorption systems that exhibit a strong increase in @xmath72 to very high doppler parameters whereas the increase in @xmath22 is only modest .",
    "most of the uncertain , broad features lie on this branch ( open circles ) , although there are a few systems with reliable values for log @xmath22 and @xmath72 ( filled circles ) .",
    "if this branch is not an artifact caused by line blending , continuum undulations and/or other effects , we may have found a new , independent class of low - column density hi absorbers with large to very large doppler parameters . if thermal line broadening would be the dominating broadening mechanism for these systems , they may trace whim absorbers in the @xmath29 to @xmath363 k temperature range .",
    "such whim absorbers naturally would have very low neutral gas fractions ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and therefore low hi column densities .",
    "we consider the reliability and nature of these broad absorbers in the following section",
    ".      from all ly@xmath11 lines listed in tables 3 and 5 we are particularly interested in those with @xmath72 values exceeding @xmath364 kms@xmath4 , as they may sample intervening whim absorbers with temperatures above @xmath196 k. however , it is likely that next to thermal broadening other effects like line blends , unresolved sub - components , low s / n , kinematic flows , hubble broadening and continuum undulations contribute to the population of broad absorbers along the line of sight towards pg1259 + 593 . for the single - line ly@xmath11 absorbers listed in table 5",
    "we have analyzed in detail the shape and other properties of the absorbers in order to sort out those lines for which there is evidence that their width is caused not by thermal broadening but by something else .",
    "some of the absorbers show typical signatures for unresolved sub - components , as indicated by asymmetric line shapes or positive / negative velocity wings .",
    "these cases have been marked accordingly in the last row of table 5 .",
    "moreover , for many of the broader lines listed in table 5 the estimate for @xmath72 is very sensitive to the choice of the continuum level .",
    "this , together with the relatively low s /",
    "n for some of these lines , limits the credibility of the identification of broad lines with @xmath72 values above @xmath364 kms@xmath4 , although the formal @xmath73 errors derived from voigt profile fitting ( see figs.23 , 24 , and table 5 ) may be only a few percent . from tables 3 and 5",
    "we find nine broad absorption systems detected solely in hi ly@xmath11 ( table 5 ) and/or ly@xmath12 ( table 3 ) with @xmath72 values larger than @xmath364 kms@xmath4 for which a ) we can determine @xmath72 with a reasonable accuracy ( i.e. , their status given in table 5 is ok ) , and b ) which do not show any evidence for unresolved sub - structure or blending . these absorbers are listed in table 6 .",
    "table 6 also lists the two ovi systems that have hi @xmath72 values larger than @xmath364 kms@xmath4 and that do not show evidence for further sub - component structure ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "it is important to note at this point that the current stis data are not accurate enough to _ exclude _ that line blending , sub - component structure , or continuum undulations contribute to the large widths of the absorbers given in table 6 .",
    "we can only claim that the current data _",
    "show no evidence _ that these lines are affected by such processes .",
    "we thus regard these systems as possible candidates for thermally broadened whim aborbers with temperatures @xmath365 k. despite the remaining uncertainty about their nature , we want to discuss their physical and statistical properties in the following to explore , what importance the possible existence of such systems has for our knowledge about the whim and its baryonic content .",
    "all of the candidates listed in table 6 have @xmath366 kms@xmath4 , sampling a temperature regime ( for pure thermal broadening ) of approximately @xmath367 to @xmath368 k. thus , none of the really broad lines with @xmath369 kms@xmath4 from table 5 are considered to be sufficiently securely detected ( see also fig.24 , lower - most panel ) .",
    "this has to do mostly with the difficult continuum placement for the particularly broad and shallow features . as these broad absorbers (",
    "if real ) may contain a large amount of the baryonic mass in the igm , we will - nevertheless - discuss the importance of these lines for @xmath370 in the following . in principle , the broad ly@xmath11 lines may sample whim absorbers a ) that have total column densities too low for ovi being detectable , b ) that have total column densities comparable to existing ovi systems but have very low oxygen abundances , or c ) that have large total column densities but temperatures too high ( @xmath371 k ) for ovi to be present unless the total hydrogen column density would be very large .",
    "the latter type of absorbers is particularly interesting , as such whim clouds would contain large amounts of baryonic matter and could be observed in x - ray ovii / oviii absorption ( `` x - ray forest '' ; e.g. , rasmussen , kahn & paerels 2003 ; fang et al.2002 ) .",
    "we expect the broad ly@xmath11 absorbers to arise in shock - heated , highly - ionized gas clouds ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ) , so the first step towards estimating their baryonic content is to determine their ionization fraction . in the following ,",
    "we assume collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) and use the models presented by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) . for the cooler and denser clouds with @xmath216",
    "k the assumption of cie may be somewhat problematic , as such gas may cool rapidly .",
    "however , the cooler absorbers also have the lowest baryon content , so their uncertainty contributes only little to the total uncertainty for deriving the overall baryonic content of the broad ly@xmath11 lines . for",
    "the higher temperature ly@xmath11 absorbers the assumption of cie should be reasonably accurate .",
    "for the temperature regime between @xmath29 and @xmath30 k the ionization correction parameter calculated by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , log @xmath372log ( h@xmath373h@xmath374h@xmath375 log ( h@xmath376h@xmath250 ) , can be approximated by a simple polynomial :    @xmath377    from equation ( 1 ) , it follows that log @xmath378log(60@xmath379 ) for hydrogen , which can be set into equation ( 2 ) to derive log @xmath380 for an individual absorber directly as a function of its @xmath72 value ( under the assumption that thermal broadening is the dominating broadening process ) .",
    "the cosmological mass density of the broad ly@xmath11 absorbers , @xmath370(bl ) ( in units of the todays critical density , @xmath381 ) , can be given as    @xmath382    where @xmath383 corrects for the presence of helium , @xmath384 kg is the proton mass , @xmath385 kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 and @xmath386 .",
    "@xmath387 is the distance interval in which the broad ly@xmath11 absorbers are located .",
    "the index @xmath388 is running from 1 to @xmath389 , where @xmath389 is the number of broad ly@xmath11 aborbers in the distance interval @xmath387 . for a redshift range from @xmath390 to @xmath391 and with @xmath392 we can write    @xmath393-[(1+z_{\\rm min})^2 - 1]\\}.\\ ] ]    however , a blocking correction has to be included for @xmath387 to account for the regions in which possible broad ly@xmath11 absorbers may remain unnoticed due to blending with other ism or igm lines . for pg1259 + 593 , the available redshift path to detect broad ly@xmath11 absorbers is @xmath394 .",
    "the total blocking from other intergalactic and interstellar lines for this redshift range sums up to @xmath395 , and we estimate @xmath396 from equation ( 4 ) . if we take the eight candidates detected solely in hi ly@xmath11 listed in table 6 ( ignoring the one broad ly@xmath12 system at @xmath320 for which ly@xmath11 lies outside the stis wavelength range ) , we find a number of broad ly@xmath11 aborbers per unit redshift of @xmath397 toward pg1259 + 593 .",
    "note that we do not consider the two additional ovi systems listed in table 6 at this point , as they are treated separately to constrain @xmath398 and the resulting @xmath370(ovi ) ( see also  3.3 ) . for each of the eight ly@xmath11 absorbers we can derive @xmath399 from equation ( 2 ) , as listed in table 6 ( seventh column ) .",
    "as we formally can not exclude that processes other than thermal broadening contribute to the width of the lines given in table 6 , we conservatively list the values for @xmath399 and @xmath97 as upper limits . together with the measured column densities , @xmath22(hi@xmath400",
    ", we thus obtain @xmath401(bl)@xmath402 .",

    "@xmath404 m and an average metallicity of 0.1 solar ; see savage et al.2002 ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath401(ovi ) depends on the assumed metallicity , while @xmath401(bl ) is determined independently of the metallicity .",
    "however , although we have very carefully selected our sub - sample of broad ly@xmath11 lines , we are heavily biased against absorbers with large @xmath72 values , which have the highest ionization correction and which thus contain most of the baryonic mass .",
    "all the absorbers listed in table 6 have @xmath72 values less than @xmath150 kms@xmath4 , because the shallow , broad absorbers with higher @xmath72 values listed in table 5 are most uncertain . however , if only one of the very broad features listed in table 5 is a real thermally broadened hi absorber , the baryonic mass density derived from the presence of this _ single _ absorption system ( if representative for the given redshift path ) would be immense - it would have a larger baryonic content than the combined contributions of all nine systems not containing ovi listed in table 6 . for future observations",
    "it is therefore of crucial interest to investigate whether similar broad absorbers are seen also toward other low - redshift quasars , and to evaluate their frequency and physical properties .        to further investigate the properties and nature of the detected metal line systems ,",

    "is found for the galaxy ugc08146 ( @xmath93 ) and the absorption system at @xmath92 ( see  3.2.1 ) , which shows hi absorption and possibly absorption by ovi .",

    "assuming @xmath385 kms@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , the redshift of @xmath93 ( @xmath413 kms@xmath4 ) corresponds to a distance of @xmath414 mpc .",

    "the angular separation between ugc08146 and the line of sight to pg1259 + 593 is @xmath416 arcmin , so that the projected distance is only @xmath417 kpc .",
    "if we take the small redshift difference of @xmath418 ( @xmath419 kms@xmath4 ) into account and assume a `` pure '' hubble flow ( see , e.g. , stocke et al.1995 ) , we derive a cloud - galaxy distance of @xmath420 kpc .",
    "the sight line towards pg1259 + 593 thus appears to pass through the immediate intergalactic environment of ugc08146 .",
    "ugc08146 is a dwarf spiral , classified as sc(d ) ( e.g. , stil & israel 2002 ) .",
    "the optical diameter of ugc08146 in the blue is @xmath421 kpc ( defined as @xmath422 magnitude isophote , including an extinction correction ) , while the hi effective diameter ( enclosing 50 percent of the hi mass ) is @xmath423 kpc or more than twice as large ( rhee & von albada 1996 ) .",

    "if these galaxies are part of a loose galaxy group , the detected hi and the possible ovi absorption at @xmath92 may sample one or more filaments in the hot intragroup gas . the feature that we have ( tentatively ) identified as ovi @xmath94 absorption in the @xmath92 absorber ( see  3.2.1 and fig.13 ) is very broad , ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath105 kms@xmath4 .",
    "this is much broader than what would be expected for pure thermal broadening for ovi based on the hi @xmath72 value of @xmath424 kms@xmath4 . for pure thermal broadening one",
    "expects @xmath72(ovi)=@xmath72(hi)@xmath425 kms@xmath4 because of the 16 times higher atomic weight of oxygen .",
    "however , the ( very uncertain ) width for ovi rather corresponds to @xmath426 kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus , if real , the ovi might trace very hot intragroup gas with a large velocity dispersion , while the hi samples somewhat cooler gas that is more confined . a value of @xmath426 kms@xmath4 for hot intragroup gas would be in good agreement with typical line - of - sight velocity dispersions observed in loose groups of galaxies ( e.g. , tucker et al.2000 ) .",
    "additional uv and optical data would be very helpful to further investigate the possible connection between the @xmath92 absorber and ugc08146 .",

    "this is evident from the narrow line widths ( @xmath444 kms@xmath4 ) of some of the weaker ovi absorbing structures at high redshifts with log @xmath22(hi@xmath445 ( bergeron et al.2002 ; carswell , schaye & kim 2002 ) .",
    "such small @xmath72 values are inconsistent with temperatures @xmath365 k. however , the results of simcoe , sargent , & rauch ( 2002 ) imply that collisional ionization has to be taken into account for the higher - column density ovi systems at @xmath446 ( log @xmath22(hi@xmath447 ) , as this gas possibly traces shock - heated material from supernova - driven galactic winds .",
    "an important but yet unanswered question is , what baryonic mass fraction of the whim at low @xmath448 is not detected in studies that concentrate solely on ovi absorption ?",
    "whim clouds that have intrinsically low gas column densities , and/or low metallicities , and/or very high temperatures ( @xmath449 k ) are difficult to detect in ovi absorption .",
    "other high ions such as neviii may trace the whim in a higher temperature regime , but our study ( and other measurements ) provide no evidence that there exists a significant number of detectable intervening neviii absorbers at low redshifts . towards pg1259 + 593",
    "we have not found significant ( @xmath450 ) neviii absorption in any of the absorption systems .",
    "the possibility to detect neviii absorption in fuse and stis data , however , is probably low due to the relatively low cosmic abundance of neon compared to oxygen ( log ( ne / o)@xmath451 ; allendeprieto , lambert , & asplund 2001 , 2002 ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) and the lower s / n of the fuse data in the spectral region where the neviii lines are accessible . in two systems ( @xmath203 and @xmath217 ) neviii absorption may be present at low statistical confidence ( @xmath452 ) ; if more neviii data from other sight lines will become available , one may find evidence for neviii absorption in whim absorbers by stacking together a larger number of neviii velocity profiles .",
    "observations of the x - ray absorption in the lines of ovii , oviii and other species are becoming an important way to trace hot gas in the local intergalactic medium ( rasmussen , kahn & paerels 2003 ; fang et al.2002 ; nicastro et al.2002 ) .",
    "but even with the most modern x - ray observatories , such as _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ,",
    "observations of intervening intergalactic x - ray absorbers represent a challenging task , and so far the number of detected x - ray absorption features in the igm is quite low .",
    "thus , good statistics about the low - redshift x - ray forest will not be readily available in the near future .",
    "a promising approach to trace the whim at temperatures up to @xmath453 k is to search for broad , shallow ly@xmath11 absorbers . with the fuse and stis data presented here we possibly have found for the first time evidence that at least part of the whim up to @xmath453 k may be traced by ly@xmath11 absorption .",
    "support for the detectability of gas this hot in ly@xmath11 comes from x - ray observations .",
    "studies of the immediate intergalactic environment of the milky way suggest the possible presence of an whim filament with an ovii column density of @xmath454 @xmath24 ( see rasmussen , kahn , & paerels 2003 ) .",
    "if this ovii column density is representative for a whim absorber , and if we further assume a temperature of @xmath363 k together with collisional ionization equilibrium ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and a metallicty of the gas of 0.1 solar , we would expect to see ly@xmath11 absorption at the level of log @xmath22(hi)@xmath455 and @xmath456 kms@xmath4 , in line with some of the broader absorbers towards pg1259 + 593 listed in table 5 .",
    "depending on the column density and temperature distribution of the whim absorbers , it may be that only a small fraction of these systems can be detected in hi absorption",
    ". there could be , however , also a number of whim systems that are somewhat cooler than the x - ray absorbing systems , and thus have larger neutral gas column densities and possibly ovi absorption .",
    "the relatively strong and broad @xmath253 absorber towards pg1259 + 593 could be an example for such a `` transition system '' .",
    "the hi @xmath72 value ( @xmath457 kms@xmath4 ) , the probable detection of ovi absorption and the resulting ovi @xmath72 value ( @xmath458 kms@xmath4 ) , as well as the limits derived for oiv and neviii are all consistent with a whim absorber at @xmath459 k. this system thus may represent the best observational evidence that some broad ly@xmath11 absorbers indeed trace the whim .",
    "dav & tripp ( 2001 ) have performed hydrodynamic simulations to produce artifical absorption line spectra to compare the characteristics of the simulated ly@xmath11 absorption with stis absorption line data for the low - redshift igm towards pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 .",
    "they use an automated voigt profile fitting technique to determine column densities and @xmath72 values for both artifical and real spectra , finding excellent agreement between these two data sets . as shown in their fig.4 ,",
    "they do not find a population of very broad ly@xmath11 absorbers that would trace the whim at @xmath460 k. however , it is not clear what sensitivity the automated fitting routine has for very broad , shallow absorption features . since artificial and real data are fitted in an identical manner , the routine possibly could miss weak absorbers with large doppler parameters , mainly because such features would be treated as continuum undulations and removed in the normalization process .",
    "thus , a population of weak , broad ly@xmath11 lines may remain unnoticed in the simulated spectra and the stis data of pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 using this technique .",
    "a careful re - inspection of these data is necessary to clarify this point .",
    "additional high s / n observations with stis will be important to investigate whether the broad features we have detected in the line of sight towards pg1259 + 593 really arise from high - temperature whim absorbers , or whether they only represent a mixture of instrumental effects and unresolved absorption components .",
    "having available a larger number of sight lines with different background continua clearly would help to tackle some of the systematic effects that hamper the non - ambiguous identification of broad , shallow absorption features .",
    "also , combined x - ray and fuv observations will help to answer the question of whether broad ly@xmath11 features can serve as a reliable tracer for gas with temperatures up to @xmath461 k. if so , studying broad ly@xmath11 absorbers in high s / n fuv spectra could be a big step forward to understand the distribution and physical properties of the whim at low redshifts and its baryonic content .",
    "we have analyzed intergalactic absorption in fuse and stis fuv spectra of the qso pg1259 + 593 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we identify 135 intergalactic absorption lines at @xmath462 m , including @xmath463 metal line systems that are detected in one or more lines of ciii , civ , oiii , oiv , ovi , and siiii .",
    "we determine equivalent widths and column densities for 72 absorption line systems .",
    "the overall distribution of doppler parameters ( @xmath72 values ) and column densities for the local ly@xmath11 forest towards pg1259 + 593 is consistent with results from previous studies considering lines with @xmath464 kms@xmath4 .",
    "we discuss physical conditions in the metal - line systems .",
    "the two strongest absorption systems at @xmath84 and @xmath86 consist of multiple absorption components with different gas - phases . for the single - component system at @xmath204 the analysis of hi , ciii , oiii , and oiv",
    "absorption implies abundance ratios of log @xmath465o / h@xmath188=-0.5 $ ] and log @xmath465c / o@xmath188=-0.5 $ ] .",
    "this is comparable with what is found in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "the number of intervening ovi absorbers along this line of sight is @xmath14 for a typical equivalent width limit of @xmath466 m .",
    "together with an unobscured redshift path of @xmath467 this number implies @xmath468 in this direction . at this equivalent width limit ,",
    "the finding is consistent with @xmath398 results from previous absorption line studies .",
    "the result supports the idea that intervening ovi systems trace a significant fraction of the baryons in the local universe residing in the warm phase of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "\\4 . a broad ly@xmath11 absorption system ( @xmath469 kms@xmath4 )",
    "is found at @xmath253 .",
    "the system is possibly also detected in ovi @xmath94 absorption .",
    "this absorber may represent a collisionally ionized intergalactic gas cloud at a temperature of @xmath470 k and a very low but uncertain oxygen abundance , ( o / h ) , of @xmath471 solar .",
    "we detect a large number of broad ly@xmath11 lines along the line of sight towards pg1259 + 593 with doppler parameters @xmath472 kms@xmath4 and relatively low column densities ( log @xmath22(hi)@xmath473 ) .",
    "if thermal broadening determines the large widths of these lines , their @xmath72 values correspond to temperatures between @xmath29 and several @xmath363 k. although some of these lines may be composites of several blended , unresolved absorption features , caused by continuum undulations , or are produced by gas flows and hubble broadening , we speculate that at least some of these features represent whim absorbers that are not detected in ovi absorption . from a sub - set of eight well - detected broad ly@xmath11 lines ( bl ) with @xmath364 kms@xmath474 kms@xmath4",
    "we estimate @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "if the line widths are dominated by thermal doppler broadening , then these absorbers would contain a large fraction of the baryons in the low - redshift igm .",

    "<S> we use _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) and _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) spectra to study intergalactic absorption towards the quasar pg1259 + 593 ( @xmath0 ) , with a particular emphasis on the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) . </S>",
    "<S> the combined fuse and stis spectrum of pg1259 + 593 covers the full wavelength range between @xmath1 and @xmath2  at a spectral resolution of @xmath3 kms@xmath4 for the fuse bandpass ( @xmath5  ) and @xmath6 kms@xmath4 for the stis range ( @xmath7  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) per resolution element are @xmath8 ( fuse ) and @xmath9 ( stis ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify 135 intergalactic absorption lines with equivalent widths @xmath10 m , tracing 78 absorption components in 72 ly@xmath11/ly@xmath12 absorption - line systems . </S>",
    "<S> metal - line absorption by species such as ciii , civ , oiii , oiv , ovi , and siiii is clearly detected in four systems , and is possibly seen in four additional cases . </S>",
    "<S> we study the distribution and physical properties of the whim as sampled by ovi and intrinsically broad ly@xmath11 lines . </S>",
    "<S> the number of intervening ovi absorbers for equivalent widths @xmath13 m is @xmath14 over an unobscured redshift path of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a number density of ovi systems , @xmath16 , of @xmath17 above this equivalent width limit along this sight line . </S>",
    "<S> a seventh intervening ovi absorber is possibly detected with @xmath18ovi)@xmath19 m . the range of @xmath20 for @xmath13 m is consistent with estimates from other sight lines , supporting the idea that intervening intergalactic ovi absorbers contain an substantial fraction of the baryonic mass in the low - redshift universe . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a number of broad ly@xmath11 absorbers with large doppler parameters ( @xmath21 kms@xmath4 ) and low column densities ( @xmath22(hi)@xmath23 @xmath24 ) . for pure thermal broadening </S>",
    "<S> , these widths correspond to temperatures of @xmath25 k. while these broad absorbers could be caused by blends of multiple , unresolved lines , continuum undulations , or by kinematic flows and hubble broadening , we consider the possibility that some of these features are single - component , thermally broadened ly@xmath11 lines . </S>",
    "<S> these systems could represent whim absorbers that are too weak , too metal - poor , and/or too hot to be detected in ovi . </S>",
    "<S> if so , their widths and their frequency in the pg1259 + 593 spectrum imply that these absorbers trace an even larger fraction of the baryons in the low - redshift universe than the ovi absorbing systems . a thermal doppler broadening explanation for one of these broad features </S>",
    "<S> is supported by the probable detection of ovi near the velocity of a broad ly@xmath11 and ly@xmath12 absorber with an ovi line width @xmath26 times smaller than for hi . </S>"
