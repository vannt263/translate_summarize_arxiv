    "thin elastic sheets form rich patterns when stressed or confined .",
    "one may try to account for these patterns as weak deformations of a simple ( e.g. , flat ) reference state .",
    "it has been recognized , however , that as the sheet is made increasingly thin and bendable , the validity range of such near - threshold analyses shrinks indefinitely , along with their experimental relevance @xcite .",
    "crumpled paper is a prime example of such a far - from - threshold behavior @xcite .",
    "a thin elastic sheet , compressed on top of a heavy fluid @xcite , provides a simpler example of this situation .",
    "the leading - order analysis of the deformation yields a periodic pattern of wrinkles with wavelength @xmath0^{1/4}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the finite wavelength arises from a competition between the resistance of the sheet to bending ( @xmath1 being the sheet s bending rigidity ) and the resistance of the fluid substrate to height changes ( @xmath2 being the fluid mass density and @xmath3 the gravitational acceleration ) . since @xmath1 depends on the sheet thickness @xmath4 as @xmath5 , the wrinkling wavelength decreases with decreasing thickness as @xmath6 .",
    "a higher - order analysis reveals that the wrinkling pattern is actually stable only for small lateral displacements , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the total length of the sheet @xcite .",
    "this validity range diminishes with either decreasing @xmath4 or increasing @xmath8 . beyond it",
    "the deformation becomes localized in a finite domain ( fold ) of width @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it takes a mere displacement of @xmath10 to concentrate all the deformation into a single wavelength and make the fold contact itself @xcite .",
    "thus , the relevant response of a sufficiently thin sheet is practically always far from threshold , involving a strong localized deformation .",
    "similar observations hold when the fluid substrate is replaced by a linear elastic one @xcite .",
    "it is therefore fortunate and beneficial that the fluid - supported sheet under uniaxial compression turns out to be an integrable system @xcite .",
    "exactly solvable problems often owe their integrability to extra symmetries . in the current work we focus on the corresponding extra symmetry in the fluid - supported sheet , which is manifest in a continuous degeneracy of ground states @xcite .",
    "we connect this peculiar property of the one - dimensional buckling problem to the simple translational symmetries of the two - dimensional sine - gordon problem .    in secs .",

    "an incompressible sheet of bending modulus @xmath1 lies on a semi - infinite fluid of mass density @xmath2 .",
    "the sheet is assumed to be indefinitely long and deform in the @xmath11 plane , remaining uncurved along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "the deformation is parameterized by either the height profile @xmath13 or the slope angular profile @xmath14 as a function of the arclength @xmath15 along the sheet .",
    "the two functions are geometrically linked by the relation @xmath16 , where hereafter a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "the sheet is subjected at its edges to a uniaxial pressure @xmath17 along @xmath18 , which is accompanied by a displacement @xmath19 between the two edges .    a given deformation costs energy per unit length , @xmath20 , with contributions from bending , @xmath21 , and from gravity , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "we use dimensionless variables , where all lengths are scaled by @xmath24 and all energies by @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig_degenerate ] one can try to follow these small changes between consecutive curves .",
    "we verify that such an infinitesimal transformation leaves the mechanical energy of the sheet unchanged .",

    "the total vertically displaced fluid mass must vanish .",
    "the localized solutions of the profile equation should automatically satisfy this constraint .",

    "the physical property of the sheet ",
    "fluid composite , underlying the extra symmetry , is unclear . we have found no physical argument to explain why the shape transformation described in sec .",
    "[ sec_shape ] leaves the mechanical energy of the sheet invariant .",
    "nonetheless , in the two - dimensional problem , in which we have embedded our one - dimensional system , the extra symmetry is a trivial translation invariance along the extra dimension .",
    "the surprising fact that the different energy contributions are _ individually _ invariant to the shape transformation generated by @xmath46 follows as well from an evident symmetry of the sine - gordon chain  the invariance to exchange of its two light - cone coordinates ( which in turn derives from the time - reversal symmetry of the chain of pendulums ) .",
    "each energy term is obviously invariant to translation along the sheet ( i.e. , translation in @xmath15 ) and , therefore , due to the @xmath125 symmetry , must be individually invariant also to translation in @xmath52 .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the phason freedom in quasicrystals @xcite . in the actual quasicrystal",
    "the degenerate phason states correspond to nontrivial coordinated flips of atom locations . yet ,",
    "once the quasicrystal is represented as a projection of a higher - dimensional bravais lattice @xcite , the phason flips are obtained from simple lattice translations along the extra dimensions .",
    "an important distinction between the new symmetry and phasons is that the generated transformation is continuous rather than discrete .",
    "thus , there are no energy barriers between the degenerate shapes .",
    "boundary conditions are expected to remove the degeneracy and will usually favor the symmetric and/or antisymmetric states @xcite .",
    "the corresponding energy differences , however , should be exponentially small in @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , we anticipate important consequences of the continuous degeneracy for the dynamics of ultra - thin fluid - supported films .    on the face of it ,",
    "the @xmath46 symmetry arises only from the _ translational _ invariance of the two - dimensional host system in which it is embedded .",
    "there is no apparent need for _ integrability _ of the host system . yet , when one attempts to determine @xmath46 in practice for a non - integrable host system , the procedure of eqs .",
    "( [ k1])([k5 ] ) fails .",
    "the differential conditions imposed by these equations do not integrate to a well - defined function of @xmath127 .",
    "the requirement that these conditions must define a definite @xmath46 function may then be a way of formulating the condition for integrability of the host system .",
    "the floating elastic sheets discussed here occur widely in physical systems , especially in molecular and nanoparticle monolayers @xcite .",
    "thus we expect the degenerate shapes described above to have physical implications .",
    "first , one should in principle see the degeneracy in the model experiments on macroscopic sheets where this folding was initially demonstrated @xcite .",
    "however , only the symmetric and antisymmetric folds were reported .",
    "these sheets had lengths @xmath8 not much greater than the width of the deformed region , so that boundary effects not considered here could have broken the degeneracy . in molecular sheets",
    "@xcite one may imagine a distortion of the @xmath12-invariant fold in which the asymmetry parameter varies slowly along the @xmath12 direction , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_twistyfold ] .",
    "the extra energy for such a distortion must vanish as its wavelength goes to infinity , even though its amplitude is large . here too , extra effects may act to select one or another of the asymmetric folds .",
    "for example , self - attraction favors the symmetric fold , since this variant approaches itself more closely than the others . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of a fold requires viscous dissipation , enhanced by shear stress .",
    "this stress is likely greater in the symmetric fold , so that the antisymmetric fold should be kinetically favored .",
    "the symmetry and degeneracy found here were an indirect and mysterious consequence of the integrability of the two - dimensional host system .",
    "though we have discussed it in the context of a particular embedded system of physical interest , we expect that analogous symmetries occur elsewhere in the sg - mkdv hierarchy .",
    "these symmetries may ultimately deepen our understanding of integrability in these systems . in physical terms",
    "these degenerate deformations and the aforementioned `` soft modes '' associated with them may ultimately shed light on the experimental puzzles of how molecular folding and unfolding occur in practice @xcite .",
