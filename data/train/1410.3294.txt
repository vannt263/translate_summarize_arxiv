    "the _ fermi _ satellite was launched on 2008 june 11 and has since greatly increased the number of known pulsars emitting in the @xmath0-ray band . the principle instrument aboard",
    "the satellite is the large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite ) , a pair - production telescope which is sensitive to energies in the range 20  mev - 300  gev .",
    "the impact of the mission so far can be seen from the 2nd _ fermi _ pulsar catalog @xcite , which details 117 detections ( at @xmath2  100  mev ) of @xmath0-ray - loud pulsars .",
    "this factor of 20 increase in the number of pulsars which can be studied in the high energy regime makes investigation of the pulsar @xmath0-ray emission process more important than ever .",
    "knowledge of the ` viewing geometry ' of these pulsars can significantly aid this study .",
    "particularly important is the determination of the path traced across the magnetosphere by the observer s line of sight as the pulsar rotates , which can be characterised by two angles ; the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes , @xmath1 , and the angle @xmath3 between the magnetic axis and the line of sight at the closest approach between the two . if these are known for a particular pulsar , a given model of the sky pattern of @xmath0-ray emission ( such as those described in @xcite ) will be able to predict , for example , the shape of that pulsar s intensity profile",
    "this can then be compared with observations , allowing the veracity of the model to be judged .",
    "the determination of the viewing geometry is therefore useful in the study of the pulsar emission mechanism .",
    "a recent study by @xcite highlighted a general problem that @xmath0-ray light - curves can only be meaningfully interpreted when radio data are also considered .",
    "these authors used @xmath0-ray light - curve and radio profile fitting to constrain the viewing geometry in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , the angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis .",
    "they note that if they consider radio - loud pulsars , but ignore their radio profiles in the fitting procedure , the resulting @xmath3 values do not appear to be confined to small values .",
    "this is unlikely to be realistic , given the fact that the radio emission should be significantly more beamed compared to the @xmath0-rays .",
    "they conclude that @xmath0-ray light - curve fitting in general does not lead to unique solutions in @xmath1 and @xmath5 space and that radio observations are crucial to break this degeneracy .    the intention of this paper is to derive emission geometries , which can facilitate the interpretation of @xmath0-ray light - curves and therefore potentially impose important constraints on various proposed @xmath0-ray models . using data obtained with the parkes radio telescope as part of the _ fermi _ timing programme @xcite we attempt to place constraints on the viewing geometry for 28 young , @xmath0-ray - detected pulsars , all of which were included in @xcite . as the angles @xmath1 and @xmath3 should be independent of observing frequency [ j0908 ] )",
    ". however , the intrinsic values are frequency - independent and the uncertainty of a few degrees introduced by scattering is in general not the most significant source of uncertainty in the sample considered in this paper . ]",
    ", the results derived here can be applied to observations of these pulsars at any part of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "a further point which is worthy of note is that , although there are large uncertainties on most of the @xmath1 values presented in this paper , @xmath3 will be shown to be well constrained for most of the sample .",
    "this is useful for attempts to constrain the @xmath0-ray models as requiring a small value of @xmath3 greatly restricts the region of ( @xmath1 , @xmath5 ) parameter space which is of interest , helping to lift the aforementioned degeneracy",
    ".    one method of constraining @xmath1 and @xmath3 is to fit the rotating vector model ( rvm ; @xcite ) to the observed polarisation position angle ( pa ) swing .",
    "the pa of the linearly polarised emission , @xmath6 , is a function of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and the pulse phase , @xmath7 , according to    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the position angle and pulse phase , respectively , of the steepest part of this curve @xcite .",
    "the steepest gradient of the rvm curve is given by    @xmath11    @xcite .",
    "if the observed pa swing shows little curvature , only its gradient is constrained , leading to a constraint on @xmath12/@xmath13 ( see @xmath14  [ sectchi2surfaces ] for details of the fitting procedure ) . in",
    "( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) space this results in a characteristic ` banana ' shape of the goodness - of - fit , which can be seen in , for example , fig .",
    "[ figj0631 + 1036 ] .",
    "the steepest gradient occurs at @xmath10 , the ` inflection point ' of the pa curve .",
    "the rvm predicts that this coincides with the passage of the line of sight through the ` fiducial plane ' , the plane containing both the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "however , in practice observations show the inflection point to be delayed relative to the position of the fiducial plane as inferred from the intensity profile ( @xmath15 ) by an amount of rotational phase @xmath16 .",
    "this delay is predicted by relativistic effects known as aberration and retardation ( a / r ) .",
    "the net delay predicted by a / r effects is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the rotation period of the star , @xmath19 is the speed of light and @xmath20 is the emission height , the distance of the emission region from the centre of the star @xcite .",
    "the observed delay can be shown to be independent of @xmath1 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "estimates can be obtained for @xmath10 from rvm fitting ( see @xmath14  [ sectchi2surfaces ] ) and for @xmath15 based on the profile morphology ( see @xmath14  [ sectemissionheightconstraint ] ) . given these estimates @xmath21 can be determined from the data and so eq .  [ eqoffset ] can be used to calculate @xmath20 . as discussed by for instance @xcite",
    ", variations in the emission height between different components will cause distortions in the pa curve and hence could affect the determination of @xmath21 .",
    "this effect is probably strongest for pulsars older than those discussed in this paper , hence we assume @xmath20 to be constant across the emission region for a given pulsar .",
    "the potential effects of variations in the emission height will be considered in @xcite .    the angles @xmath1 and @xmath3 are also related to another observable , the pulse width of the radio profile .",
    "if the radio beam is defined as the cone bounded by tangents to the last open field lines at the emission height , the half - opening angle of the beam , @xmath22 , can be calculated .",
    "assuming that the magnetic field is dipolar ,    @xmath23    with @xmath24 , the angular radius of the open - field - line region , given by @xmath25 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the half - opening angle of a conical emission beam centred on the magnetic axis can be related to @xmath26 , the range in pulse phase for which the line of sight samples the open - field - line region .",
    "this relation is dependent on the viewing geometry via the equation    @xmath27    a similar method of combining this information has been used by previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", this work differs from those in two important ways .",
    "firstly , we consider uncertainties on the relevant parameters , which allows us to determine errorbars on the fit parameters in a more objective way . secondly , although we use the core - cone model @xcite as a basis for our estimation of @xmath15 , we argue that the conservative nature of these estimates means that our results are unlikely to be inconsistent with the patchy beams suggested by @xcite ( see @xmath14  [ sectemissionheightconstraint ] ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in @xmath14  [ sectmethod ] we describe the observations and methodology used . in @xmath14  [ sectresults ] we present intensity and polarisation profiles and viewing geometry constraints for the individual pulsars and a table with constraints is compiled . in @xmath14  [ sectalphadistribution ]",
    "we discuss the derived distributions of magnetic inclination angles for pulsars exhibiting single - component and multiple - component profiles .",
    "we also compare our results with those obtained from @xmath0-ray modeling by @xcite .",
    "@xcite will discuss the overall distribution of @xmath1 values , and its dependence on assumptions about the radio beam .",
    "the data used were collected as part of the _ fermi _ timing programme at the parkes radio telescope , described in detail by @xcite . a total of 168 pulsars",
    "are observed drawn from a list of pulsars with large - spin - down rates , and hence potentially high energy @xmath0-ray emission , given by @xcite supplemented by a few additional objects .",
    "the programme consists of monthly observations at 1369 mhz ( 20 cm ) with a 256 mhz bandwidth and twice - annual observations of the same pulsars at 3100 mhz ( 10 cm ) and 685 mhz ( 50 cm ) , with bandwidths of 1024 mhz and 40 mhz respectively @xcite . at each frequency",
    "the band is divided into 1024 channels and the pulse phase resolution is 1024 bins per pulse .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the sample of 28 pulsars which are @xmath0-ray - loud and published in the second fermi pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "we use observations taken between 2007 april and 2013 october . for the majority of pulsars ,",
    "the observations at 1369  mhz were used .",
    "some pulsars however are significantly scatter - broadened due to propagation through the interstellar medium at this frequency and so the observations at 3100  mhz were used instead ( see table  [ tabderivedparameters ] ) . in the cases of psrs",
    "j10195749 and j14106132 the profile is still severely scatter - broadened at 3100  mhz ; in the latter case we used unpublished parkes data at 6100  mhz .",
    "the data were polarisation calibrated and individual observations of the same pulsar were summed largely following the method described in @xcite , resulting in a single profile for each pulsar .",
    "the pa as a function of phase , @xmath28 , was calculated from the stokes parameters for each pulsar .",
    "any pa values for which the signal - to - noise ratio of the linearly polarised component of the emission was less than 2@xmath29 were discarded .",
    "only the remaining values were used in subsequent fitting of eq .",
    "[ eqpa ] . in order to constrain the geometrical parameters ,",
    "a gridsearch was performed in ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) space .",
    "the least-@xmath30 fit between the rvm curve and the data was then determined by optimising the remaining free parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "the obtained constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath3 are sensitive to the pulse phase resolution of the data . decreasing the resolution increases the signal - to - noise ratio per bin . as a result ,",
    "the significance of the linear intensity in bins at the edges of the pulse is increased , allowing the pa to be determined over a wider range of pulse phase .",
    "however , decreasing the resolution can potentially result in distortion of the pa swing ( especially where the gradient is largest ) leading to an unreliable rvm fit . for each pulsar , @xmath30 surfaces",
    "were calculated using 1024 , 512 , 256 and 128 bins per rotation period and the optimum resolution ( see table  [ tabderivedparameters ] ) was determined and used for all subsequent processing of that pulsar .",
    "the reduced-@xmath30 values resulting from this fitting process correspond to a surface in ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) space , an example of which can be seen in fig .  [ figj0631 + 1036 ] .",
    "three contours are shown , corresponding to 2 , 3 and 4 times the global least-@xmath30 value .",
    "these represent 1@xmath29 , 2@xmath29 and 3@xmath29 uncertainties in @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the error on @xmath10 was calculated by fitting for @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 repeatedly as @xmath10 was varied , and determining the value of @xmath10 at which the resulting fit had a reduced-@xmath30 four times that of the global least-@xmath30 fit ( equivalent to a 3@xmath29 error ) , thereby recognising the fact that there are unmodeled features in the observed shape of the pa curve ] .",
    "this range and the most likely value are displayed by the horizontal bar above or below the pa curve in figs .",
    "[ figj0631 + 1036 ] - [ figj1835 - 1106 ] .",
    "previous authors who have used rvm fitting and the a / r effect to determine viewing geometries ( e.g. , @xcite ) have traditionally assumed that the emission region fills the open field lines and hence that @xmath15 must be at the centre of the observed on - pulse region .",
    "however , the emission beam may not be symmetrically illuminated . to account for such an effect , the assumption that @xmath15 is at the centre of the profile was relaxed in this investigation .",
    "instead a range of possible values was determined based on the component positions , using the core - cone model as a basis @xcite and allowing for some components to be missing from the observed profile . the horizontal bar above the profile in figs .",
    "[ figj0631 + 1036 ] - [ figj1835 - 1106 ] displays the chosen range and our preferred value .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the asymmetry is the consequence of a beam which is populated by randomly distributed ` patches ' @xcite . in this case",
    "the core - cone model will not be valid .",
    "however , as the @xmath15 ranges chosen typically cover a large proportion of the pulse they are likely to be consistent with a patchy beam , and if the patches are truly random we do not expect patchy beams to cause any bias in the derived viewing geometries .",
    "this would therefore imply , for instance , that the derived @xmath1 distribution should still describe the population as a whole .    as discussed in @xmath14  [ sectchi2surfaces ] , a range of allowed values for @xmath10",
    "was determined from fitting to the pa curve .",
    "this range , together with the range of @xmath15 determined from the profile shape , allows a range @xmath31 to be established .",
    "the corresponding ranges of @xmath20 and @xmath22 were calculated using eqs .",
    "[ eqoffset ] , [ eqbeamhalfopeningangle ] and [ eqthetapc ] .",
    "finally , if @xmath26 is known , eq .  [ eqrhocontours ] provides an additional constraint . in these equations @xmath22",
    "is taken to be the opening angle of a beam corresponding to an emission region confined to the open - field - line region . to account for the possibility of beams which are only partially illuminated we take @xmath26 to be twice the separation ( in phase ) between the determined @xmath15 and the edge of the profile furthest from it .",
    "the assumption we make is therefore that at least one edge of the profile reaches the last open field line and hence , as the open - field - line region is symmetric about the fiducial plane , @xmath26 must account for an equal amount of phase before and after @xmath15 .",
    "there is an uncertainty in the precise location of the pulse edges due to the tapering nature of the emission and the presence of noise .",
    "the points at which the intensity was 10% of the peak intensity were taken as the most likely to correspond to the last open field lines .",
    "this definition makes the determination of the pulse edges independent of the s / n . in most cases",
    "the uncertainties were taken to be the differences between the phases at which the intensity was 20% and 10% of the peak . however , in some cases such choices were clearly not representative of the pulse edge and so the limits were chosen somewhat more subjectively ( see @xmath14  [ sectresults ] ) .",

    "could also be determined for @xmath26 .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath15 and the pulse edges were varied within the allowed ranges and for each combination @xmath22 and @xmath26 were calculated .",
    ".  [ eqrhocontours ] was used to derive the corresponding contour in ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) space .",

    "such a consideration of the uncertainties on these parameters , which allows a more complete appraisal of the possible viewing geometries for each pulsar , has not been used previously when constraining viewing geometries .",

    "none of the four cases showed a significant tendency towards correlation .",
    "there are several reasons why the two sets of values might be uncorrelated .",
    "firstly , it is possible that none of the @xmath0-ray models are a good description of the physics .",
    "if true , this might be somewhat surprising given that the shape of the @xmath0-ray light - curves , at least for the models which place the extended emission region in the outer magnetosphere , is in first order determined by the pulse phase ranges where caustic emission is expected to happen .",
    "one could expect this geometric effect to be at some level independent of the detailed physics .",
    "another possibility is that the absence of a correlation between the @xmath1 values derived in this paper and by phg14 is caused by the fact that the interpretation of the radio data is very different .",
    "for example , phg14 only considered the shape of the radio profile and assumed that the radio emission height follows an empirical relation described by @xcite , whereas in this paper we considered both the radio profile morphology and polarisation allowing us to determine the emission height .",
    "although these methods will be inconsistent up to some level , it remains to be seen whether this difference would have a significant effect on the derived @xmath1 values from joint radio and @xmath0-ray fitting . as shown by phg14 ,",
    "the effect of considering radio data is effectively to down - weight solutions with large @xmath3 values .",
    "since the different methods to interpret the radio data will have a similar effect , it could be expected that the fine details of the radio model only have a minor effect on the resulting @xmath1 values .",
    "how big this effect is can potentially be determined by considering the constraints derived in this paper together with the fits of @xmath0-ray data .",
    "in this paper we have presented constraints to the viewing geometry ( characterised by the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath1 , and the impact parameter of the line of sight relative to the magnetic axis , @xmath3 ) for a sample of @xmath0-ray - loud pulsars .",
    "this constraint has two components .",
    "the first is associated with the goodness of fit between the rotating vector model and the observed pa curve .",
    "the second is associated with the emission beam half - opening - angle derived from the relative offset in pulse phase between the inflection point of the pa curve and the location of the fiducial plane in the profile ( which represents the point of closest approach between the line of sight and the magnetic axis ) . in determining the latter constraint ,",
    "we have taken into account uncertainties on the fiducial plane , inflection point and pulse edges in a systematic way .",
    "this new approach is more conservative and therefore in many cases allows regions of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) parameter space to be objectively excluded with greater confidence .",
    "in addition to this conservative constraint , we also determined our preferred viewing geometry for each pulsar , allowing a statistical analysis of the results .",
    "we find that the @xmath1 distribution exhibits an unexpected skew towards low values .",
    "these pulsars are all younger than the various observationally estimated timescales for alignment of the magnetic inclination angle due to magnetic torques , suggesting the observed distribution should be the birth distribution for this sample .",
    "if the magnetic axis is randomly orientated with respect to the rotation axis at the birth of a neutron star , it follows that this birth distribution of @xmath1 should be sinusoidal .",
    "further to this , the pulsars investigated in this paper have all been detected in @xmath0-rays .",
    "high energy models predict that pulsars are more easily detectable in @xmath0-rays when the magnetic inclination is large , as the intensity modulation is more pronounced .",
    "this would be expected to introduce a selection effect resulting in an abundance of highly inclined pulsars relative to the sinusoidal distribution .",

    "we have also reported evidence for absent leading components in some of the pulse profiles which exhibit only a single component .",
    "an argument can be made that these are extreme cases of the intensity asymmetry noted in double - component profiles of young pulsars by @xcite .",
    "however , the sample size is too small to determine whether this effect applies to all apparently single - component young pulsars .",
    "we have found a lack of correlation between the @xmath1 values derived here from radio intensity and polarisation data and those derived by @xcite from consideration of the radio and @xmath0-ray light curves .",
    "this indicates a possible problem in the interpretation of the radio and/or @xmath0-ray data which requires further investigation .",
    "however , despite this uncertainty in @xmath1 , the tight constraints on @xmath3 which we have presented should prove useful for future attempts to determine the @xmath0-ray emission mechanism .",
