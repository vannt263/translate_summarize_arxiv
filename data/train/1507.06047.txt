    "in contrast to the single - orbital mott physics in copper oxides , the physics underlying in iron pnictides and chalcogenides is more complicated owing to the multi - orbital character . for example , stripe - type antiferromagnetic structure is considered to originate not only from the fermi - surface nesting but also from the orbital ordering , which appears at the almost same critical temperature with that of the magnetic ordering .",
    "consequently , as possible candidates of the paring glue of cooper pairs , magnetic fluctuations as well as orbital fluctuations are theoretically argued.@xcite to understand the mechanism of iron - based high - temperature superconductivity , considerable experimental efforts to elucidate the role of each characteristic behaviors of charge , spin , and orbital in related materials is necessary .",

    "in contrast to the metallic conduction in most 2d iron - based superconductors , all of @xmath7fe@xmath8 known so far are insulators under ambient pressure .",
    "a particularly important point is that @xmath7fe@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath7 = k and cs ) , in which the average fe valence is mixed - valent 2.5 + , has even higher resistivity than bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 with the average fe valence of 2 + , despite the absence of charge ordering.@xcite on the other hand , even though the distinct electrical conduction , the magnetism of @xmath7fe@xmath8 has a close resemblance to that of the 2d iron - based superconductors : bafe@xmath0se@xmath1 shows 2 @xmath10 2 block - type magnetic structure@xcite just like that of @xmath11fe@xmath12se@xmath0 ( @xmath7 = k and rb);@xcite bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 shows stripe - type magnetic structure with the spin direction along the rung direction,@xcite which is similar to that of lafeaso@xmath13h@xmath13;@xcite and @xmath7fe@xmath0se@xmath1 ( @xmath7 = k , rb , and cs ) show stripe - type magnetic structure with the spin direction along the leg direction,@xcite which resembles that of lafeaso and @xmath7fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( @xmath7 = sr , and ba).@xcite note that the ordered magnetic moments in the ladder compounds are 1.2 - 2.8 @xmath14 , and are much reduced from the localized moments expected for the high - spin state of fe@xmath15 ions , 4 @xmath14 .",

    "the strip - type magnetism is stabilized by the fermi surface nesting between hole and electron pockets .",
    "we simply assume that the mass of electrons is heavier than that of holes , which is different situations from 2d iron - based superconductors.@xcite in this case , moderate electron doping can keep the nesting feature and then sustain the antiferromagnetic state . on the other hand , small amount of hole doping easily weaken the nesting feature , destabilizing the antiferromanegtic state .",

    "the reason is probably the disorder effect on the fe plane induced by co substitution , which destabilize antiferromagnetic ordered state.@xcite the superconductivity under high pressure likely emerges owing to large magnetic fluctuations originating from the fermi surface nesting ; therefore , the fine tuning of doping level can potentially improve the superconducting functionalities such as the critical temperature and the critical pressure .    in the localized electron picture ,",
    "the electron - hole asymmetry is well accounted for by assuming that the holes are doped not into the fe 3@xmath52 orbitals but into the ligand s 3@xmath53 orbitals in the hole - doped system ; this likely happens because the fe@xmath54 ions are high - valence in the chalcogenides and belong to the negative charge - transfer regimes.@xcite the antiferromagnetic interaction between fe 3@xmath52 electron spins and s 3@xmath53 hole spin is considered to produce an effective ferromagnetic interaction between two fe spins locating adjacent to each other across s site , which competes with the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between two adjacent fe spins .",
    "this magnetic frustration breaks the antiferromagnetic ordering rapidly .",
    "on the other hand , the doped electrons are introduced to the fe sites , so that there appears no magnetic frustration , resulting in the robust antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "these electron - hole asymmetry is the characteristic behavior of a doped mott insulator , which is quite analogous to the physics in copper based superconductors.@xcite in this scenario , therefore carrier doping , especially hole doping , may improve the critical temperature and the critical pressure of the superconductivity . in order to determine",
    "which scenario is more plausible , further theoretical and experimental studies on electronic and magnetic structures are required .",
    "we have investigated the effect of stoichiometry and substitution on the electronic and magnetic properties of iron - based ladder compound bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 .",
    "the resistivity and magnetization are quite sensitive to the off - stoichiometry , and the antiferromagnetic transition temperature reaches highest value 122 k in true stoichiometric composition .",
    "the antifferomagnetic ordering is robust against co doping , while it is rather easily broken by k doping ; such electron - hole asymmetry can be understood based on both itinerant and localized electron pictures .",

    "<S> the effects of off - stoichiometry and elemental substitution on electronic properties of iron - based ladder compound bafe@xmath0s@xmath1 are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> resistivity and magnetization are revealed to be quite sensitive to the stoichiometry of fe atoms , and 10 % deficiency at fe sites reduces the antiferromagnetic transition temperature by 40 k. the antiferromagnetic transition temperature decreases even faster and collapse to zero with hole doping through 10 % k substitution at ba site , while the antiferromagnetic ordering phase remains with electron doping through 20 % co substitution at fe site . </S>",
    "<S> such electron - hole asymmetry is opposite to two - dimensional iron - based superconductors , and can be explained on the basis of both itinerant and localized electronic pictures . </S>"
