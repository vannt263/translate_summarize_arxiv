    "we usually classify dynamical systems into deterministic and stochastic ones .",
    "deterministic systems are characterized by a set of prescribed mathematical rules which evolve the dynamical variables in time . for these kinds of models",
    "we can numerically generate trajectories over long periods of time .",
    "stochastic systems are based on some sort of random process .",
    "they may occur when extrinsic noise is present .",
    "a process also appears to be stochastic when a large number of degrees of freedom is involved . for these systems ,",
    "only statistical information can be extracted , like averages or fluctuations of physical quantities .    in this paper",
    "we consider a new example of a third , recently discovered , kind of dynamical system ( _ pseudo - deterministic _ ) , which - in spite of being deterministic - yields only statistical relevant information . the problem with those systems is not related with the correctness and exactitude of the dynamical equations , but rather with a mathematical pathology called _ unstable dimension variability _ @xcite .",
    "the goodness of deterministic models is determined by some well - known paradigms : ( i ) the model must be based on sound theoretical framework , e.g. , correctly applied physical laws ; and ( ii ) the trajectories should reproduce correctly in some sense the actual behavior observed in nature .",
    "this motivated the introduction of the _ model shadowability _",
    "concept @xcite : let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two closely related deterministic models of a physical system , but with some difference , which could be related to a small change in one of the system parameter values , or a slightly different external influence on each model , or a different noise level .",
    "the latter cause is restricted to arbitrarily small time dependent and bounded perturbations , which excludes gaussian white noise , for example .",
    "we say that model shadowability occurs if trajectories of model @xmath0 stay close to some trajectories of model @xmath1 .",
    "this is necessary , but not sufficient , for either model to reproduce and predict correctly the time evolution of the system which the model is intended to describe . in other words , if there is no model shadowability neither @xmath0 or @xmath1 would generate trajectories that are physically realized , since if no trajectory of @xmath0 is close to any trajectory of @xmath1 , it is unlikely that either model would give a trajectory that stays close to any real trajectory produced by nature .",
    "the difficulties that obstruct model shadowability have been divided into three classes : minor , moderate and severe @xcite .",
    "minor modeling difficulties occur for hyperbolic chaotic systems , since they present sensitive dependence on initial conditions . in terms of our example ,",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are hyperbolic chaotic systems , trajectories of @xmath0 can always be closely followed , or shadowed , by trajectories of @xmath1 for an infinite time @xcite .",
    "a chaotic set is hyperbolic if , at each point of a trajectory on this set , the local phase space can be split into unstable and stable subspaces , the angle between them being bounded away from zero .",
    "the unstable ( stable ) subspace evolves into the unstable ( stable ) one along the trajectory .",
    "we will call _ unstable ( stable ) dimension _ the dimension of the unstable ( stable ) subspace .",
    "however , chaotic non - hyperbolic systems are much more common in physical applications - they may present non - hyperbolic ( homoclinic ) tangencies between the unstable and stable subspaces . for these systems",
    "we say there is a moderate modeling difficulty because trajectories of @xmath0 are shadowed by trajectories of @xmath1 for a long , yet finite amount of time .",
    "however , if this shadowability time is long enough , both models are still useful for describing physical phenomena @xcite .    finally , pseudo - deterministic models present severe modeling difficulties since they are chaotic non - hyperbolic systems presenting unstable dimension variability : the unstable and stable subspaces along a chaotic invariant set have no tangencies , but the dimension of the unstable subspace varies from point to point . for this case",
    "the shadowability time is very short , and no useful information could be extracted from single trajectories over a reasonable time span , but rather statistical information based on a probability distribution @xcite .    unstable dimension variability has been introduced by abraham and smale through a two - dimensional continuously differentiable map @xcite . a common feature associated with unstable dimension variability is the oscillating behavior of a finite - time lyapunov exponent between negative and positive values .",
    "this occurs because typical trajectories present arbitrarily long ( but finite - time ) segments for which the orbit on the average is repelling in one dimension and other segments for which it is repelling in two dimensions .",
    "this behavior has been found in a four - dimensional invertible map describing a kicked double rotor @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of statistical predictions has been argued through computation of the average energy and higher moments for this model @xcite .",
    "recently a non - invertible two - dimensional map was proposed as the simplest dynamical system exhibiting unstable dimension variability @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been shown @xcite that a lattice of diffusively coupled hnon maps present unstable dimension variability for any nonzero coupling strength . in this paper , we propose a new example where unstable dimension variability occurs in the context of synchronization of chaotic orbits of two linear maps with nonlinear coupling . by changing variables to the synchronization manifold of the coupled system , we get a map that was first studied in the context of super - persistent chaotic transients and crises @xcite .",
    "we have identified the mechanism which brings unstable dimension variability to the chaotic invariant set of this system , namely a saddle - repeller bifurcation which was formerly related to the boundary crisis mechanism @xcite .",
    "it produces a structure composed of super - narrow tongues through which trajectories on a chaotic saddle may escape after very long transients before they are reinjected , since the map is taken to be modulo some number .",
    "a chaotic saddle is an invariant compact set @xmath2 that is both attracting and repelling and it contains a chaotic trajectory which is dense in @xmath2 .",
    "this structure is similar to that observed in the context of the so - called riddling bifurcations @xcite .",
    "the fluctuating behavior of the transversal finite - time lyapunov exponent is described for this example and statistical information about its distribution is presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the second section we introduce the coupled chaotic map system and analyze its synchronization manifold and the corresponding non - invertible map on a torus .",
    "the following two sections are devoted to the description of the saddle - repeller bifurcation , the average transient lifetime and the birth of unstable - dimension variability .",
    "section v deals with the distribution of finite - time transversal lyapunov exponent and the relative fraction of its positive values .",
    "the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "coupled dynamical systems are susceptible to the synchronization of their trajectories , by which they undergo closely related motions , even when they are chaotic . in the latter case , even if two identical systems are started with different initial conditions , if the coupling is strong enough their states are asymptotically equal as the time evolves @xcite .",
    "this is a quite different behavior , compared to that expected from uncoupled yet identical chaotic systems , since if they are started with approximately equal but different initial conditions , sensitive dependence will cause the two systems to have completely uncorrelated motion after some time @xcite .",
    "we consider two piecewise linear maps of the form @xmath3 ( mod @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 . for almost all trajectories of each map",
    "the ( infinite time ) lyapunov exponent @xmath6 is positive . by _ almost all _ we mean that all orbits generated from this map are chaotic , except for a set of zero lebesgue measure containing countably infinite periodic points @xcite .",
    "we can write @xmath7 , which is greater than one provided @xmath8 , and change the variable range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , without altering the chaotic nature of the map orbits . in this case , @xmath11 may be regarded as an angle variable .",
    "let us introduce a nonlinear coupling of two such chaotic maps , which is equivalent to a nonlinear map on a torus @xmath12 :    [ mapa ] u_n+1 = ( 1 + ) u_n + u(u_n , w_n ) ( mod  ) , + [ mapb ] w_n+1 = ( 1 + ) w_n + w(u_n , w_n ) ( mod  ) ,    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given by    [ u ] u(u_n , w_n ) = ( 1- ) w_n + ^2 + ( ) , + [ w ] w(u_n , w_n ) = ( 1- ) u_n - ^2 - ( ) ,    where @xmath15 .    for coupled dynamical systems like this one",
    ", we can obtain the synchronization state , which is given by @xmath16 .",
    "geometrically , this state defines a synchronization manifold @xmath17 , which is a one - dimensional subset of the phase space @xmath18 .",
    "if we represent this torus on a square with periodic boundaries , the synchronization manifold is a straight line with unitary slope ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    in order to describe the dynamics in the synchronization manifold and in the direction transversal to it",
    ", we make a coordinate transformation , equivalent to a clockwise rotation of the axes through an angle of @xmath19 :    [ theta - z ] = , z= .",
    "there results a two - dimensional non - invertible map on a torus    [ mkya ] _",
    "n+1 & = & 2_n ( mod  2 ) , + [ mkyb ] z_n+1 & = & z_n + z_n^2 + _ n ( mod  ) , where @xmath20 . here",
    "the synchronization manifold is simply the axis @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 , the map decouples into two independent maps in @xmath23 and @xmath24 , so that an initial condition in the synchronization manifold will generate a chaotic orbit @xmath25 with @xmath26 for all times , that will never escape from @xmath17 .",
    "hence , @xmath17 is an invariant manifold only for @xmath22 .",
    "an invariant manifold is typically related to the existence of some kind of symmetry in the system , so we may call @xmath27 a _ symmetry - breaking _ parameter . for nonzero",
    "@xmath27 a chaotic orbit of the system is not restricted to the synchronization manifold , and can occupy a larger portion of the phase - space along the transversal direction @xmath24 .",
    "the map ( [ mkya]-[mkyb ] ) was introduced , in a slightly different form , @xcite to describe a kind of crises characterized by long - lived , or super - persistent , chaotic transients .",
    "they have used the @xmath28 part of the map without the modulo @xmath29 prescription , i.e. , @xmath24 was allowed to have any real value in @xmath30 . for some parameter values , as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the map ( [ mkya]-[mkyb ] ) shows a chaotic attractor near the @xmath21 line .",
    "it consists of a series of curved strips with self - similar structure , as hnon - like bands ( fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite . a crude argument that can be used to justify the chaotic nature of this attractor",
    "consists on linearizing the map ( [ mkyb ] ) about @xmath21 using @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a small quantity .",
    "we obtain the map @xmath35 , that would give a chaotic attractor for @xmath36 , as proved by kaplan and yorke @xcite .",
    "if the modulo @xmath29 prescription were absent from @xmath24-map , the system would present , in addition , a non - chaotic attractor at infinity @xmath37 , and the basin of attraction of the two attractors would present a fractal boundary @xcite . in our case , however , there is no other attractor except the one near @xmath38 . besides this chaotic attractor",
    ", there is another chaotic set which is a chaotic saddle ( a non - attracting chaotic invariant set ) .",
    "it is located where the fractal basin boundary would be if the modulo requirement were disregarded .",
    "trajectories which would accelerate to large-@xmath24 values , are reinjected into the negative-@xmath24 region due to the modulo prescription .",
    "the mechanism whereby the chaotic attractor of the map ( [ mkya]-[mkyb ] ) loses hyperbolicity through unstable dimension variability is basically an unstable - unstable pair bifurcation . as a result ,",
    "the chaotic attractor may collide with the chaotic saddle and disappears into a larger chaotic saddle from which trajectories may escape , through a complex structure of super - narrow tongues .",
    "it is also called saddle - repeller bifurcation @xcite , and has been found as the cause of other strange behavior in chaotic systems , like riddling of basins of attraction @xcite and boundary crises @xcite .",
    "a linear stability analysis can show the basic features of this transition .",

    "2 , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath40 lies in the upper point ( i.e. , the point with the highest value of @xmath24 ) of the chaotic attractor , whereas @xmath41 is in the lowest point of the chaotic saddle .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the map is    [ j ] (    c c 2 & 0 + - _ n & + 2 z_n    ) ,    whose eigenvalues are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so , the @xmath23-direction is always unstable , as it should be due to the existence of the chaotic attractor .",
    "the eigenvalue related to the transversal direction , evaluated at the fixed points ( [ zbc ] ) , gives    [ autovalor ] _",
    "2(z_b , c ) = 1 2 ,    so that , for @xmath44 , @xmath41 is a repeller , since it has an unstable dimension of dimension 2 , and no stable subspace at all .",
    "@xmath40 is a saddle point , since both stable and unstable subspaces have dimensions equal to one ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) .",
    "if @xmath45 the fixed points @xmath40 and @xmath41 coalesce at @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "since the eigenvalue is equal to one at this point , linear stability analysis fails to determine its stability , and we have a saddle - repeller bifurcation with eigenvalue @xmath47 at @xmath45 . for @xmath48 the fixed points no longer exist , and we have a different dynamical behavior ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) .",
    "when the fixed points coalesce at @xmath45 , the chaotic attractor collides with the chaotic saddle , and it becomes a _ chaotic transient _ through an interior crisis ( since the attractor has collided with an unstable periodic orbit ) @xcite .",
    "trajectories arising from initial conditions belonging to the former basin of the chaotic attractor will typically approach its remnant , that is now a part of a larger chaotic saddle and will bounce around it in an irregular fashion .",
    "however , after some ( typically very long ) time this trajectory will stay near the region where the fixed points have coalesced , and will leave the chaotic saddle , being eventually reinjected to the vicinity of the saddle due to the modulo prescription .    at the location where the fixed points coalesced @xmath49 ,",
    "a tongue opens - up , allowing trajectories near the chaotic saddle to escape for @xmath48 .",
    "simultaneously , each preimage of @xmath50 also develops a tongue . since these preimages are dense in the chaotic saddle , an infinite number of these tongues open - up simultaneously when @xmath45 .",
    "actually , these tongues will develop at those points where @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 positive integers .",
    "for our map , however , these tongues are very narrow , since their width decrease geometrically , and are extremely difficult to find numerically , with exception of the main tongue opened - up at @xmath50 .",
    "to understand how chaotic transients are formed after the saddle - repeller bifurcation , let us consider the z - part of the map ( [ mkyb ] ) at @xmath54 ( from where the main tongue grows up )    [ zmap ] z_n+1 = z_n + z_n^2 + ,    whose fixed points @xmath41 and @xmath40 are the intersections between the parabolic function and the first bisector @xmath55 ( fig .",

    "4(c ) ) . due to the modulo requirement",
    ", the map iterates are reinjected and enter again in the channel .",
    "this is the basic mechanism of type - i intermittency @xcite , but since the @xmath23-direction is unstable , the slow motion through the channel does not imply a laminar behavior . rather , it is related to a chaotic transient , that is characterized by irregular wandering of the trajectory over a limited @xmath23-range .",
    "the chaotic transient decays when the trajectory enters a tongue , escaping toward larger @xmath24-values , before it is reinjected .",
    "the main tongue is formed about the @xmath54 line , so let us focus our attention on this spot . for @xmath27 values greater than @xmath56 ,",
    "a tongue intercepts the synchronization manifold @xmath38 in an aperture of width @xmath59 near @xmath54 , through which the trajectories can escape .",

    "from now on , we set @xmath64 .",
    "the trajectory , however , does not immediately stays close to @xmath54 since the @xmath23-direction is unstable ( its eigenvalue is @xmath65 , pulling back the trajectory into the vicinity of the chaotic saddle ) .",
    "let @xmath59 be the distance between the orbit and @xmath54 at a given time .",
    "after @xmath60 iterates this distance increases to @xmath66 .",
    "however , since the @xmath23-excursion is bounded , we expect that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a @xmath69 constant .",
    "now we consider what happens with a large number of trajectories arising from randomly chosen initial conditions . due to the ergodicity of the @xmath23-motion",

    "hence , the probability of @xmath72 falling into the aperture @xmath73 $ ] , if @xmath74 is not in this interval , is equal to the interval width @xmath59 .",
    "so , we can estimate the average lifetime @xmath75 of the chaotic transient as the inverse of this probability .",

    "the average transient lifetime @xmath75 was then computed for many values of the difference @xmath89 , the results being depicted in fig . 5 , where the parameter @xmath90 in the theoretical prediction above is the fitting parameter .",

    "( [ theory ] ) when we approach @xmath56 , i.e. , in the neighborhood of the saddle - repeller bifurcation .",
    "the lifetime of the transients can be very large , for instance up to @xmath91 transients , even though we are as far from @xmath56 as @xmath92 .",
    "this occurs because the aperture width @xmath59 is so narrow that it becomes extremely difficult for an orbit to escape .",
    "therefore , a better agreement between the theoretical prediction ( [ theory ] ) and the numerical result only occurs for @xmath27 closer to @xmath56 .",
    "far from @xmath56 , the theoretical estimate we made ceases to be valid , but remains useful as a lower bound for the exit time of transients .",
    "we have seen that , at the saddle - repeller bifurcation @xmath45 , an infinite number of points , dense on the chaotic attractor , become repellers ( unstable dimension two ) , and an infinite number of super - narrow tongues crop up as result of the collision between the attractor and the chaotic saddle .",
    "however , there remains a dense set of saddle points ( unstable dimension one ) in the invariant set , and since these two different sets are densely intertwined , unstable dimension variability does occur in the chaotic invariant set for a large range of parameter values of the map .",
    "yet , another signature of unstable dimension variability , as stated in the introduction , is the fluctuating behavior of the finite - time lyapunov exponents between negative and positive values . consider a d - dimensional map @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a d - dimensional vector and @xmath95 is a d - dimensional vector field .",
