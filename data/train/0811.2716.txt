    "@xmath59 because of the onsite coulomb repulsion on the d orbital , the state @xmath60 has s much higher energy than @xmath61 , and it will be ignored .",
    "we can then write @xmath62 \\alpha\\beta \\equiv \\gamma\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the hund s exchange term in the d orbitals , @xmath64(@xmath65 ) is the energy of an electron in a p(@xmath66 ) orbital on the as atom , and hund s exchange term in the as 4p orbitals is ignored",
    ". the factor of 4 results from the fact that an electron on the fe atom can hop to any of the four surrounding as atoms . in a similar way",
    ", we can construct the remaining matrix elements and diagonalize the hamiltonian in the 5-dimensional subspace spanned by the states @xmath67 .",
    "needless to say , the expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 5x5 matrix are unwieldy .",
    "instead , we diagonalize the matrix in the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath30 and @xmath33 , draw the necessary conclusions , and then extrapolate to the more general case .    thus , assuming for the time being that only states @xmath30 and @xmath33 are mixed by the hamiltonian , we can express @xmath68 by a @xmath69  matrix @xmath70 the ground state energy is now given by @xmath71 and @xmath72 is lower than the energy @xmath73 of state @xmath74 by @xmath75 given by @xmath76   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "the unperturbed energy @xmath78 is the same in both the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases , but @xmath75 does depend on the crystalline phase .",
    "since @xmath79 depends only weakly on @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 where the superscript @xmath49 stands for electronic. the above expression is negative for all values of @xmath63 , @xmath80 and @xmath79 . from our earlier discussion",
    ", we may take @xmath82 ev , @xmath83 ev , 2@xmath84 ev .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are all estimated to be in the range @xmath40.7 - 1 ev  @xcite ; this gives @xmath85 ev .",
    "the above expression then reduces to @xmath86 which is negative .",
    "we thus conclude that a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic distortion lowers the electronic energy of the d state by a term proportional to @xmath80 ( ignoring the @xmath87 term , being smaller than the linear term ) .",
    "the distortion takes place by a small increase in the lattice constant @xmath10 and a corresponding decrease in lattice constant @xmath11 . assuming this small distortion is @xmath88 , then @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath88 , and we can write @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is some constant . on the other hand , this distortion raises the elastic energy by an amount @xmath91 where @xmath92 is some constant .",
    "the value of the distortion @xmath93 is found by minimizing @xmath94 giving @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "what we have just shown is that the hybridization between the fe 3d states and as 4p states causes a greater downward shift in energy if the crystal distorts from tetragonal to orthorhombic , and seeking the lowest energy available , the crystal will indeed undergo such a distortion .",
    "the ground state eigenket is obtained from the eigenvector corresponding to the ground state energy , @xmath97 where @xmath98.\\ ] ] using the values of the parameters given earlier , we find @xmath99 in the range @xmath40.5 - 0.7 . in the ground state",
    "the expectation value of the magnetic moment of the fe atom is @xmath100 since @xmath101 , the magnetic moment in state @xmath33 , is zero , it follows that @xmath102 . in other words ,",
    "the hybridization causes a large reduction in the value of the would - be magnetic moment .",
    "we may now consider the mixing of all the states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "the qualitative results obtained so far remain unchanged .",
    "qualitatively , the ground state will be a mixture of five states , in four of which the magnetic moment is zero .",
    "therefore , we expect a further reduction in the expectation value of the fe magnetic moment",
    ". in fact we do not need to restrict ourselves to these states ; we may also consider mixing with states where one electron resides on the d@xmath9 orbital .",
    "all this leads to the conclusion that strong hybridization between the fe 3d and as 4p orbitals causes spin fluctuations on the fe sites and a subsequent reduction in the measured value of the fe magnetic moment , in agreement with neutron scattering measurements .  @xcite    we now consider what happens as some oxygen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms .",
    "fluorine doping causes further negative charge transfer from the reo / f layer to the as atoms , since it involves replacing o@xmath103 with f@xmath104 .",
    "this strengthens the ionic bond and shortens the distance between the re and as ions . indeed",
    ", neutron scattering measurements  @xcite indicate that the la - as separation decreases by 0.03 @xmath105 upon f - doping , with a concomitant reduction in the c - lattice constant .",
    "but the extra charge , donated by the re ions , is not uniformly spread among the as ions ; more of this charge resides on as ions close to the f atoms , rather than on those further away , and some local distortion of the as ion positions is expected . with such distortion , and with an uneven charge distribution on the as ions , the crystal field at a given fe site now has a symmetry lower than @xmath6 . considering a single fe atom ,",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath106 where @xmath31 contains the part of the crystal field with s@xmath107 symmetry , while v is the additional part which lowers that symmetry .",
    "the orbitals fe 3d@xmath24 and 3d@xmath34 are eigenstates of @xmath31 but not @xmath32 ; the perturbation v mixes these two states .",
    "let @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ; these matrix elements are proportional to the f - dopant concentration . then the energy splitting 2@xmath80 of the two states",
    "is given by @xmath111 and the two new split states @xmath112 and @xmath113 are linear combination of @xmath114 and @xmath115 . as the f dopant concentration increases , the energy splitting increases , and",
    "if 2@xmath80 becomes larger than @xmath63 , the contribution of state @xmath33 , shown in fig  [ fig : figure2 ] , to the ground state wave function becomes dominant , and the fe magnetic moment becomes very small , causing the magnetic order to be suppressed .",
    "if the fluorine concentration is @xmath116 , then in the reo / f layer , every position in the o / f plane is occupied by a fluorine atom with probability @xmath116 and by an oxygen atom with probability @xmath117 .",
    "the overall symmetry of the crystal structure , as seen in x - ray measurements , is still tetragonal with symmetry group p4/nmm .",
    "the instantaneous potential seen by an electron depends on the ionic positions and is given by @xmath118 where v@xmath119 is the static part of the potential , q@xmath120 is a lattice normal coordinate , and because of the invariance of v under the crystal symmetry group , @xmath121 transforms according to the same irreducible representation as q@xmath120 . since in the presence of f doping ,",
    "the fe electronic orbitals @xmath122 are nondegenerate , then @xmath123 vanishes unless @xmath121 is totally symmetric under the crystal symmetry group operations .",
    "it follows that any spontaneous distortion that occurs must be totally symmetric and will not lower the crystal symmetry .",
    "hence , f doping suppresses the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic distortion .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that strong hybridization between the fe 3d orbitals and the as 4p orbitals introduces some interesting effects . in the undoped systems , it causes a larger downward shift in the electronic energy if the crystal undergoes a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic distortion which lifts the degeneracy of the fe 3d@xmath24 and 3d@xmath34 levels .",
    "the ground state , in the presence of hybridization , is found to be a mixture of states , most of them with zero fe magnetic moment , so that in this ground state the expectation value of the fe magnetic moment is small .",
    "we have also argued that the symmetry lowering caused by fluorine doping suppresses both the lattice distortion and the magnetic order of the fe moments .",
    "finally , we note that although the mechanism for superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors is not understood yet , we believe that the spin fluctuations on the fe sites , caused by hybridization between the fe 3d and the as 4p states , may play a role , not only in suppressing the magnetic order , but also in the emergence of superconductivity in these compounds ."
