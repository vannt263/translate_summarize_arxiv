    "in flavor physics the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element  @xmath6 plays an important role . much of the phenomenology of @xmath7 violation centers around the unitarity triangle , and a precise value of  @xmath1 is needed to locate the triangle s apex in the complex plane . as a fundamental parameter of the standard model",
    ", @xmath6 sometimes appears in unexpected places .",
    "for example , the standard model prediction of the @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing parameter @xmath10 is very sensitive to  @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the determination of  @xmath1 is made through inclusive and exclusive semileptonic  @xmath11 decays , but at present both methods are limited by theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the inclusive method requires a reliable calculation of the total semileptonic decay rate of the @xmath11 meson , which can be done using the heavy quark expansion  @xcite .",
    "ultimately this method is limited by the breakdown of local quark - hadron duality , which is difficult to estimate .",
    "the exclusive method , on the other hand , requires a theoretical calculation of the form factor  @xmath12 of @xmath2 decay . in this paper",
    "we take a step towards reducing the uncertainty in the exclusive method , by devising a precise method to compute the form factor at zero recoil in lattice  qcd .",
    "the differential rate for the semileptonic decay @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the velocity transfer from the initial state ( with velocity  @xmath16 ) to the final state ( with velocity  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the velocity transfer is related to the momentum  @xmath18 transferred to the leptons by @xmath19 , and it lies in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 has a kinematic origin , with @xmath22 .",
    "thus , given the form factor @xmath23 , one can use the measured decay rate to determine  @xmath1 .",
    "one makes use of the zero - recoil point @xmath24 , even though the phase - space factor @xmath25 suppresses the event rate , because then theoretical uncertainties are under better control . for @xmath26",
    ", @xmath23 is a linear combination of several form factors of @xmath27 transitions mediated by the vector and axial vector currents . at zero recoil",

    "heavy - quark symmetry normalizes the leading term inside the bracket to unity  @xcite and , moreover , forbids terms of order @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the  @xmath3 corrections are formally small@xmath37but one would like to reach better precision on  @xmath1 , so these terms can not be neglected .",
    "there have been mainly two different methods used to estimate the @xmath3 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ha1hqe ] ) , but neither has achieved a model independent calculation .",
    "one involves using a quark model  @xcite to estimate the  @xmath35s .",
    "the other employs the zero - recoil sum rule  @xcite . although based on a rigorous upper bound  @xcite , to make a prediction of @xmath0 this approach requires an assumption on the effects of higher excited states in the sum rule .",
    "thus  just as with quark models  it is difficult to estimate , let alone reduce , the uncertainty associated with the estimate .    in this paper",
    "we take a step towards reducing the theoretical uncertainty by using lattice qcd to calculate  @xmath38 .",
    "lattice qcd is , in principle , model independent , although here we work in the quenched approximation .",
    "the quenched approximation is not less rigorous than the methods used in refs .  @xcite . from our point of view , however , the main advantage of the quenched approximation is that it allows us to learn how to control and estimate all other lattice uncertainties . with a proven technique ,",
    "it is conceptually straightforward , if computationally demanding , to carry out a calculation in full  qcd .",
    "until now three obstacles prevented even quenched lattice calculations of @xmath32 to the needed precision .",
    "first , a direct monte carlo calculation of the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dab ] ) suffers from a statistical error that is too large to be interesting .",
    "second , the normalization of the lattice axial vector current was uncertain , being limited by a poorly converging perturbation series . finally , early works  @xcite used _ ad hoc _ methods for heavy quarks on the lattice , which entailed a poorly controlled extrapolation in the heavy quark mass .",
    "we have devised methods to circumvent all three obstacles .",
    "the first two are handled with certain double ratios of correlation functions , in which the bulk of statistical and systematic uncertainties cancel  @xcite .",
    "the third obstacle ",
    "the problem of heavy - quark lattice artifacts  is overcome by using a systematic method for treating heavy quarks on the lattice , based on wilson fermions  @xcite .",
    "this obstacle could also be overcome using lattice nrqcd  @xcite , as in the work of hein _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .    in our work  @xcite on the form factor  @xmath39 in the decay @xmath40 at zero recoil , a central role",
    "was played by the double ratio of matrix elements @xmath41 where @xmath42 in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the heavy - quark mass dependence of  @xmath39 , using a fit to obtain the @xmath3 and @xmath4 corrections .",
    "in this work we employ this double ratio and two similar ones .",
    "the first additional double ratio is @xmath43 where the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and their form factor  @xmath39 , are replaced with the vector mesons @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and their form factor  @xmath48 : @xmath49 the second additional double ratio is @xmath50 where the axial vector current mediates pseudoscalar - to - vector transitions , leading to a double ratio of the form factor  @xmath29 . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the double ratios overcome two of the obstacles in the lattice calculation , because numerator and denominator are so similar .",
    "statistical fluctuations in the numerator and denominator are very highly correlated and largely cancel in the ratio",
    ". also , most of the normalization uncertainty in the lattice currents cancels , leaving only a residual normalization factor that can be computed reliably in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "indeed , all uncertainties scale as @xmath51 , rather than as  @xmath52 .",
    "note that the double ratio  @xmath53 does not yield the desired form factor  @xmath54 , but instead the combination  @xmath55 , which is itself a double ratio of form factors .",
    "one can , however , extract @xmath32 from the three double ratios @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath53 , at least to the order in the heavy - quark expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ha1hqe ] ) .",

    "then , @xmath38 can be reconstituted through eq .",

    "the values for @xmath34 in sec .",
    "[ sec : pt ] are obtained with the quenched coupling .",

    "so , one should not expect the quenching error here to be more than  10% . even in the quenched approximation",
    "all three double ratios tend to unity in the heavy - quark symmetry limit .",

    "second , partially quenched numerical data are enough to extract the physical result , because one can use the recently derived result in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the other two main sources of systematic uncertainty are the lattice spacing dependence and the matching of lattice gauge theory to hqet and  qcd .",
    "the former is mostly a matter of computing .",
    "indeed , our present estimate may be conservative , as it is driven by the coarsest lattice . to decrease the matching uncertainties",

    "<S> we develop a new method in lattice qcd to calculate the form factor @xmath0 at zero recoil . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main theoretical ingredient needed to determine  @xmath1 from the exclusive decay @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce three ratios , in which most of statistical and systematic error cancels , making a precise calculation possible . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the heavy - quark mass dependence directly , and extract the @xmath3 and three of the four @xmath4 corrections in the heavy - quark expansion . in this paper we show how the method works in the quenched approximation , obtaining @xmath5 where the uncertainties come , respectively , from statistics and fitting , matching lattice gauge theory to qcd , lattice spacing dependence , light quark mass effects , and the quenched approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how to reduce these uncertainties and , thus , to obtain a model - independent determination of  @xmath1 . </S>"
