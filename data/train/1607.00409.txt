    "atmospheric chemistry is a nascent subdiscipline of exoplanet science that is rapidly gaining attention , because of its importance in deciphering the abundances of atoms and molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres . unlike for the earth and solar system bodies ,",
    "the bulk of the focus is on currently observable exoplanetary atmospheres , which fall into the temperature range of 500 to 2500 k ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "there exists a diverse body of work on the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets , and the published models fall into two basic groups : chemical equilibrium @xcite and photochemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "some of this work traces its roots back to the study of brown dwarfs and low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the two types of models take on very distinct approaches .",
    "chemical - equilibrium models seek to minimize the gibbs free energy of the system and do not require a knowledge of its chemical pathways .",
    "they are hence able to deal with a large number of species with different phases @xcite .",
    "chemical - kinetics models employ a network to calculate the change of every reaction rate with time , and requires the solution of a large set of stiff differential equations .",
    "chemical - equilibrium models are a simple starting point , but we expect hot exoplanets to host disequilibrium chemistry @xcite .    in the current work , we have constructed , from scratch , a computer code to calculate the chemical kinetics of hot exoplanetary atmospheres using a flexible chemical network .",
    "chemical networks at low and high temperatures , with the former being relevant for earth and the solar system bodies , are different because the dominant reactions for producing the key atoms and molecules depend non - trivially on temperature .",
    "furthermore , a low - temperature network typically uses reaction rates that are measured for a restricted temperature range , and extrapolating these rates may result in errors at the order - of - magnitude level . in constructing this code , which we name ` vulcan ` , we have built a reduced chemical network consisting of about 300 reactions for the temperature range from 5002500 k , which is compatible with the currently characterizable exoplanets .",
    "we perform a threefold validation of our network : by reproducing chemical equilibrium , by reproducing the disequilibrium - chemistry models of hd 189733b and hd 209458b by @xcite , and by studying theoretical trends .",
    "chemical kinetics codes are typically proprietary ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which raises questions of scientific reproducibility",
    ". we have constructed ` vulcan ` to be completely open - source in the hope that this will accelerate scientific progress .",
    "furthermore , the user may elect to use a chemical network that is different from what we provide . `",
    "vulcan ` is also constructed as part of a long - term hierarchical approach , which started with the re - examination of the theoretical foundations of atmospheric chemistry in @xcite , analytical carbon - hydrogen - oxygen ( c - h - o ) networks of equilibrium chemistry in @xcite and analytical carbon - hydrogen - oxygen - nitrogen ( c - h - o - n ) networks of equilibrium chemistry in @xcite . in the current study , we focus on c - h - o networks of chemical kinetics that take into account disequilibrium chemistry due to atmospheric mixing , which we approximately describe by diffusion in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) limit .",
    "we consider only the gas phase and do not include photochemistry .",
    "we investigate the validity of the quenching approximation and how it is affected by the carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( denoted by c / o ) .",
    "in  [ sect : theory ] , we state the governing equations and boundary conditions used . in ",
    "[ sect : method ] , we describe our numerical methods . in  [ sect : rates ] , we provide a detailed description of the chemical rate coefficients used in our default , reduced network , as they are a key ingredient of any chemical kinetics code . in  [ sect : benchmarking ] , we subject ` vulcan ` to several tests , thereby validating it . in  [ sect : results ] , we use ` vulcan ` to study theoretical trends , including varying c / o , and also to revisit the quenching approximation . in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] , we provide a concise summary of our current work , compare it to previous work and suggest opportunities for future work .",
    "appendix [ append : euler ] describes our rosenbrock method , which we use for temporal integration .",
    "appendix [ append : sensitivity ] describes a method we developed to identify the key chemical reactions involved in producing a specific atom or molecule .",

    "the number density of each species is given by @xmath17 .",
    "collectively , equations ( [ eq : master ] ) and ( [ eq : flux ] ) describe a diffusion equation with chemical source / production and sink / loss terms .",
    "appendix a of @xcite includes a derivation of equation ( [ eq : flux ] ) from the general diffusion equation for heterogeneous atmospheres .",
    "the so - called  eddy diffusion \" coefficient is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "it assumes that convection and turbulence occur on scales much smaller than the pressure scale height , such that atmospheric motion resembles diffusion .",
    "such an approach has been successful for earth and the solar system bodies , e.g. , in explaining the over - abundance of carbon monoxide in the upper troposphere of jupiter @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies of the atmospheric circulation of hot jupiters , in three dimensions , have demonstrated that it takes the form of equator - to - pole circulation cells that extend over several orders of magnitude in vertical / radial pressure @xcite , which renders the eddy - diffusion approximation suspect .",
    "nevertheless , it has become entrenched , within the atmospheric chemistry community , to use such an approximation @xcite and we will do the same for the purpose of comparison to previous work in the literature .",
    "we consider the use of eddy diffusion to be a  necessary evil \" for 1d calculations .",
    "the general goal is to solve a set of equations given by ( [ eq : master ] ) , for @xmath19 number of species , and seek a steady - state solution where @xmath20 , given the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the initial conditions enter according to the chosen elemental abundances . in our c - h - o network , they are the ratios of carbon , oxygen and helium to that of hydrogen ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "helium is not sequestered by any molecule but only participates in chemical reactions as a third body .",
    "we refer to the term  metallicity \" as the set of elemental abundances with atomic numbers that are larger than that of helium . in our c - h - o network",
    ", these would be @xmath21 and @xmath22 only .",
    "we note that one may adopt different values of the metallicity , but still have the same value of @xmath24    for each elemental abundance ( which we denote by @xmath25 ) , we write down the particle conservation equation @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of hydrogen atoms .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 records the number of atoms of x that this @xmath8-th molecule contains .",
    "for example , in conserving hydrogen , this quantity is 2 for h@xmath4 and 4 for .",
    "operationally , since we have three elemental abundances for c , h and o , we have three particle conservation equations .",
    "our method for specifying the initial conditions is to pick three molecules : at least one molecule needs to contain c , at least one molecule needs to contain h and at least one molecule needs to contain o. for example , a set of choices would be , and h@xmath4 .",
    "given our input values of the elemental abundances , the set of three particle conservation equations can be uniquely solved to obtain the mixing ratios of , and h@xmath4 .",
    "we use these mixing ratios as our initial conditions and set the mixing ratios of all of the other atoms and molecules , in the network , to zero .",
    "when our calculations attain a numerical steady state , we find that the outcome is independent of our choice of these three molecules , as expected .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : bic ]",
    ", we show three sets of calculations that assume different initial conditions .",
    "one of them adopts initial values for the mixing ratios of , and h@xmath4 , as we have just described .",
    "another instead adopts initial values for the mixing ratios of co , and h@xmath4 .",
    "the third set of calculations uses the analytical models of @xcite to specify the mixing ratios of all of the major molecules .",
    "it is apparent that all three sets of curves , for the erent major molecules , converge to the same numerical solutions after they are evolved for @xmath29 s. the time required to attain the numerical steady state depends on the shorter of the two timescales : chemical versus dynamical .    for the calculations we present in this study , we adopt the following values for protosolar abundance @xcite : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , except for the comparison with @xcite for hd 189733b and hd 209458b , where we follow their assumption of reducing @xmath22 by @xmath33 , accounting for the effect of oxygen sequestration . when the value of c / o is varied , we keep @xmath22 fixed and vary the value of @xmath21",
    ".            solving equation ( [ eq : master ] ) also requires the specification of boundary conditions .",
    "several combinations of choices are possible @xcite : constant deposition velocity , constant flux or constant mixing ratio at the lower and/or upper boundaries . in @xcite , the boundary conditions were chosen to describe atmospheric escape ( for the upper boundary ) and surface emission or deposition ( for the lower boundary ) , as these authors were modeling terrestrial exoplanets . in the current study",
    ", we are interested in gas - giant exoplanets with no physical surface , which necessitates the choice of a zero - flux boundary condition at both boundaries .",
    "physically , we are imposing closed boundaries at the top and bottom of our model atmosphere , meaning that no exchange of mass is permitted across them .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite both adopt zero - flux boundary conditions .",
    "some previous works have made a different choice , which is to impose chemical equilibrium at the lower boundary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( it is not uncommon to encounter studies where the choice of lower boundary condition is unspecified . ) physically , in making such a choice , one is arguing that the chemical timescale is short , compared to any dynamical timescale , deep within the atmosphere .",
    "molecules can freely flow across this open boundary until all other model levels reach a steady state with it . while this seems like a plausible approach",
    ", we find in practice that some species do not reach chemical equilibrium even at high pressures .",
    "an example is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : bic ] , where we demonstrate that , with t = @xmath34 k and @xmath5 @xmath2 s@xmath3 , co and are not in chemical equilibrium even at @xmath35 bar due to the vigorous vertical transport , so their zero - flux - boundary values deviate from those that assume chemical equilibrium by a factor of @xmath363 .",
    "these results suggest that chemical - equilibrium boundary conditions lack generality .",
    "furthermore , we are able to demonstrate that our calculations with zero - flux boundary conditions do not depend on the initial conditions assumed ( see  [ subsect : ic ] ) . for all of these reasons ,",
    "we consider the zero - flux lower boundary condition to be a better choice than an equilibrium - chemistry one when modeling exoplanets without surfaces .",

    "<S> assisted by a sensitivity test designed to identify the key reactions responsible for producing a specific molecule , we revisit the quenching approximation and find that it is accurate for methane but breaks down for acetylene , because the disequilibrium abundance of acetylene is not directly determined by transport - induced quenching , but is rather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane . </S>",
