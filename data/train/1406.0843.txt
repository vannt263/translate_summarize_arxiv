    "<S> it follows that @xmath3 defines a gapped 2d green s function in the @xmath24 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we can compute the many - body chern number associated with @xmath25 at fixed @xmath23@xcite : @xmath26 the @xmath27-component of the anomalous hall vector is then the integral over the chern number : @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this latter expression agrees with the so - called adler - bell - jackiw anomaly coefficient of the current correlator ( see appendix  [ ap : ahe ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> now , to recover eq.([eq : k ] ) , we adiabatically deform the interacting green s function into the topological green s function , @xmath29 , via the interpolation : @xmath30 , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for any slice away from the fermi surface , the gap of @xmath32 remains open during the protocol since @xmath33 for all @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the many - body chern number can not change as @xmath34 varies from 0 to 1 , being a topological index , and we can use @xmath36 to compute @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> we identify and explain the motion and renormalization of the weyl points as a function of the interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> we consider hubbard models : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a tight - binding hopping hamiltonian of spin-1/2 electrons , which are created at site @xmath40 by @xmath41 , and their number density per spin projection is @xmath42 . </S>",

    "<S> we focus on the regime where it only has 2 nodes , located on the bz boundary at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> see fig.[fig : heff]a for the @xmath51 band structure ( recall that in that limit @xmath52 ) . the anomalous hall vector is thus given by @xmath53 , i.e.@xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the study of the interacting hamiltonian using cluster perturbation theory@xcite ( cpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method , which is related to dynamical mean field theory , allows for an efficient numerical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , one first decomposes the periodic system into clusters with @xmath55 sites . </S>",
    "<S> exact diagonalization is used to obtain the exact cluster green s function . </S>",
    "<S> the green s function of the lattice system is then obtained via strong - coupling perturbation theory . </S>",

    "<S> we emphasize that it is not perturbative in @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> see appendix  [ ap : cpt ] for more details .    </S>",
    "<S> cpt allows a direct evaluation of the topological hamiltonian @xmath10 , so that we can easily track the location of the weyl points of the interacting system as a function of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the results we present are for clusters of size @xmath58 , at which point reasonable convergence with @xmath55 has been achieved ( see appendix  [ ap : cpt ] for further information regarding the convergence ) </S>",

    "<S> we set @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . </S>",

    "<S> with increasing @xmath61 , the weyl points move to larger magnitude of the wave vector . </S>",
    "<S> this directly corresponds to an increase of the hall conductivity @xmath62 , eq.([eq : k ] ) , as shown in fig.[fig : heff]b . </S>",
    "<S> the red circles are evaluated numerically with cpt . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the analytic strong coupling result ( perturbative in @xmath63 ; derived in appendix  [ ap : models ] ) , i.e.for single - site clusters , which captures the overall trend . for attractive interactions @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> the trend is opposite : the weyl points move towards @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> one can understand this heuristically : a positive / negative @xmath43 enhances / reduces the ferromagnetic moment @xmath66 ( already present at @xmath51 ) , thus enhancing / reducing the hall conductivity . </S>",

    "<S> the scattering rate of an excitation with momentum exactly at a weyl point and with small frequency vanishes like @xmath72 , as can be obtained perturbatively as shown in appendix  [ ap : liquid ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is smaller than the fermi liquid result @xmath73 , owing to the vanishing density of states at the fermi level in a wsm . as in a fl </S>",
    "<S> , the weight of the quasiparticles @xmath74 will be reduced with increasing interactions . </S>",
    "<S> ( when the weyl nodes are related by symmetry they share the same @xmath74 , which is the case in this work . ) </S>",
    "<S> the result is plotted in fig.[fig : a]c , and as expected behaves as @xmath75 at small @xmath43 , @xmath76 .     of model </S>",

    "<S> @xmath51 is the non - interacting band structure.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    we introduce a new model which , in contrast to model i , preserves trs but not inversion , and as such is a representative of the second family of wsms . we show that the influence of interactions on the motion of the weyl points has an altogether different physical origin as compared to model i , but a connection can be made by interchanging the role of magnetic and charge orders . </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding hamiltonian of model ii reads : @xmath78 where @xmath79 corresponds to a @xmath80 charge density wave ( cdw ) on the cubic lattice where the chemical potential is staggered by @xmath81 in a checkerboard fashion in the @xmath82 plane . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath83 , we do not expect the 8 weyl points to move under the effect of interactions ( modulo possible instabilities@xcite beyond a critical @xmath43 ) because they are located at special high - symmetry @xmath1-points . </S>",
    "<S> the cpt calculation corroborates this . </S>",
    "<S> we thus need to turn on a finite @xmath84 to get non - trivial evolution . at @xmath51 , </S>",
    "<S> we find a total of 16 weyl points when @xmath85 , setting @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> ( going from 8 to 16 weyl points as @xmath84 is turned on does not violate the indivisible nature of weyl points since the cdw changes the bz . ) </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath83 , four weyl points occur at @xmath86 , while four other ones at @xmath87 , where we have reinstated the spacing of the original cubic lattice @xmath88 . when @xmath89 , the eight nodes at @xmath86 `` split '' to ones at @xmath90 , similarly for @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> a finite @xmath43 moves the eight nodes nearest to @xmath86 towards / away from @xmath86 since a repulsive / attractive @xmath43 disfavors / favors the charge imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by fig.[fig : heff2 ] , which shows @xmath10 obtained using cpt .    * long - ranged coulomb interaction * : we have so far limited our discussion to short - ranged interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in an electronic wsm the screening of the coulomb interaction is weak due to the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy . using rpa , it was shown@xcite that for linearly dispersing electrons in 3d interacting via an instantaneous coulomb @xmath92 repulsion , the quasiparticle at the node @xmath93 is marginally destroyed : @xmath94 , resulting in a `` marginal weyl liquid '' . notwithstanding , </S>",
    "<S> this does not alter the fundamental berry curvature structure around the ( marginal ) weyl point . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , let us consider the low - energy description near such an isotropic point : @xmath95 , where @xmath96@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the berry curvature @xmath6 is independent of the overall real renormalization factor @xmath97 as it measures the _ complex phase _ of the @xmath25 eigenstates as they are parallel transported in the bz . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the berry flux through a small sphere surrounding the weyl point will measure the same monopole charge as when @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous statement can be made about the @xmath99 berry phase of the dirac points of graphene in the presence of coulomb repulsion .    * orthogonal weyl semimetals * : we present a case where the above characterization of a weyl - like liquid using @xmath10 breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> the idea being that particular interactions can induce a phase where the charge carrying quasiparticles have the properties of a wsm but are _ orthogonal _ to the electron due to fractionalization . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase admits a simple and stable slave - particle description : the electron operator @xmath100 can be written as the product @xmath101 of a slave fermion @xmath102 carrying the _ charge _ </S>",
    "<S> ( and spin ) , and a slave ising pseudospin @xmath103 . a @xmath104 gauge redundancy emerges because of the decomposition . in terms of these slave operators , </S>",
    "<S> a wsm results when the @xmath97-fermions form a wsm while the pseudospins are ordered . </S>",
    "<S> however , if they become disordered , an orthogonal wsm results for the electrons : the @xmath97-fermions constitute a weyl liquid since the pseudospins and @xmath104 gauge field are gapped , but they are orthogonal to the electrons ( the electronic quasiparticle weight vanishes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting orthogonal wsm is a cousin phase of the orthogonal metal@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has qualitatively the same thermodynamic and transport@xcite properties as a weyl liquid : @xmath105 heat capacity , quantum oscillations@xcite and aqh response . </S>",
    "<S> however , the electron green s function @xmath25 shows a hard `` mott '' gap , thus no weyl points . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , the aqh response can no longer be obtained using @xmath106 . instead , one has to use the @xmath97-fermion green s function . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have an instance where the adiabaticity relation to bare electrons breaks down , but where the topological hamiltonian approach can be adapted by identifying the low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation will arise for other orthogonal states , such as orthogonal topological insulators@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusion : * we have shown how to characterize interacting wsms via the many - body berry curvature ( derived from the zero - frequency green s function ) allowing the identification of the monopole structure of the weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that the existence of quasiparticles is not necessary in this , for example the latter are marginally destroyed in a wsm with long - ranged coulomb repulsion . as a natural extension , </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath10 can also be used to efficiently identify weyl nodes lying away from the fermi surface , for example in a doped weyl semimetal , which proves much simpler than resolving the full spectral function . in closing , </S>",
    "<S> our work shows the importance of the berry connection derived from the green s function in the study of correlated fermions , especially their robust ( quasi)topological features , in the gapless regime . </S>",
