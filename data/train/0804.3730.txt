    "recently , substantial progress has been achieved in the search of non - supersymmetric minkowski / ds vacua in the context of string / m - theory compactifications .",
    "this was mainly related to the understanding of the superpotentials generated by background fluxes @xcite and by non - perturbative effects like gaugino condensation @xcite , which generate a potential for the moduli fields coming from the compactification and have suggested new interesting possibilities for model building , like in particular those proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , this type of models must however posses some characteristics in order to be viable : supersymmetry must be broken , the cosmological constant should be tiny , and all the moduli fields should be stabilized . in the low energy",
    "effective theory all these crucial features are controlled by a single quantity , the four - dimensional scalar potential , which gives information on the dynamics of the moduli fields , on how supersymmetry is broken and on the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the characterization of the conditions under which a supersymmetry - breaking stationary point of the scalar potential satisfies simultaneously the flatness condition ( vanishing of the cosmological constant ) and the stability condition ( the stationary point is indeed a minimum ) is therefore very relevant in the search of phenomenologically viable string models . in this note",
    "we review the techniques presented in @xcite to study the possibility of getting this type of vacua in the context of general supergravity theories in which both chiral and vector multiplets participate to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the goal of this section is to find conditions for the existence of non - supersymmetric extrema of the scalar potential of general supergravity theories fulfilling two basic properties : i ) they are locally stable and ii ) they lead to a negligible cosmological constant .",
    "we will first study this issue for theories with only chiral multiplets and then when also vector multiplets are present .",
    "the lagrangian of the most general supergravity theory with @xmath2 chiral superfields is entirely defined by a single arbitrary real function @xmath3 depending on the corresponding chiral superfields @xmath4 and their conjugates @xmath5 , as well as on its derivatives @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath3 can be written in terms of a real khler potential @xmath6 and a holomorphic superpotential @xmath7 in the following way , @xmath8 mean derivatives with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and planck units , @xmath11 . ] : g(_i,|_i ) = k(_i,|_i ) + w(_i ) + |w(|_i ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 are however defined only up to khler transformations acting as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 being an arbitrary holomorphic function of the superfields , which leave the function @xmath3 invariant .",
    "the scalar components of the chiral multiplets span an @xmath2-dimensional khler manifold whose metric is given by @xmath15 , which can be used to lower and raise indices .",
    "the 4d scalar potential of this theory takes the following simple form : v = e^g ( g^k g_k - 3 ) .",

    ", one should proceed as follows : first impose the condition that the cosmological constant is negligible and fix @xmath20 .",
    "this flatness condition implies that : [ fc ] g^k g_k = 3 .",
    "then look for stationary points of the potential where the flatness condition is satisfied .",
    "this implies : [ sc ] g_i + g^k _ i g_k = 0 , where by @xmath21 we denote the covariant derivative with respect to the khler metric .",
    "finally , make sure that the matrix of second derivatives of the potential , @xmath22 is positive definite .",
    "this matrix has two different @xmath2-dimensional blocks , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and after a straightforward computation these are found to be given by the following expressions : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the riemann tensor with respect to the khler metric .",
    "the conditions under which this @xmath27-dimensional matrix ( [ vij ] ) is positive definite are complicated to work out in full generality , the only way being the study of the behaviour of the @xmath27 eigenvalues .",
    "nevertheless a necessary condition for this matrix to be positive definite can be encoded in the condition that the quadratic form @xmath28 is positive for any choice of non - null complex vector @xmath29",
    ". our strategy will be then to look for a special vector @xmath29 which leads to a simple constraint .    in this case",
    "there is only one special direction in field space , that is the direction given by @xmath30 . indeed projecting in that direction we find the following simple expression : [ eq ] m^2_i | g^i g^| = 6 - r_i |p |q g^i g^| g^p g^|q .",
    "this quantity must be positive if we want the matrix ( [ vij ] ) to be positive definite .",
    ", since in the limit of rigid supersymmetry its fermionic component must be massless .",
    "this means that , in order to study metastability , it is enough to study the projection of the diagonal block @xmath31 of the mass matrix along the goldstino direction @xmath32 , as the rest of the projections can be given a mass with the help of the superpotential .",
    "] using the rescaled variables @xmath33 the conditions for the existence of non - supersymmetric flat minima can then be written as : [ fs-1 ] \\ {    l g_i|f^if^| = 1 , + r_i |p |q f^i f^| f^p f^|q < .    .",
    "the first condition , the flatness condition , fixes the amount of supersymmetry breaking whereas the second condition , the stability condition , requires the existence of directions with khler curvature less than @xmath34 and constraints the direction of supersymmetry breaking to be sufficiently aligned with it .",
    "it can happen that the supergravity theory with @xmath2 chiral multiplets",
    "@xmath9 we just described has a group of some number @xmath35 of global symmetries , compatibly with supersymmetry . in this subsection",
    "we consider the possibility of gauging such isometries with the introduction of vector multiplets .",
    "the corresponding supergravity theory will then include in addition to the @xmath2 chiral multiplets @xmath9 , @xmath35 vector multiplets @xmath36 .",
    "the two - derivative lagrangian is specified in this case by a real khler function @xmath37 , determining in particular the scalar geometry , @xmath35 holomorphic killing vectors @xmath38 , generating the isometries that are gauged , and an @xmath35 by @xmath35 matrix of holomorphic gauge kinetic functions @xmath39 , defining the gauge couplings must have an appropriate behavior under gauge transformations , in such a way as to cancel possible gauge anomalies @xmath40 .",
    "actually , the part @xmath41 defines a metric for the gauge fields and must be gauge invariant . on the other hand @xmath42 must have a variation that matches the coefficient of @xmath40 , namely @xmath43 . ] . in this case",
    "the minimal coupling between chiral and vector multiplets turn ordinary derivatives into covariant derivatives , and induces a new contribution to the scalar potential coming from the vector auxiliary fields @xmath44 , in addition to the standard one coming from the chiral auxiliary fields @xmath45 .",
    "the 4d scalar potential takes the form : [ genpot2 ] v = e^g ( g^i g_i g_|-3 ) + 12 h^ab d_a d_b .",
    "the auxiliary fields are fixed from the lagrangian through the equations of motion to be : & & f_i = - m_3/2 g_i , [ f ] + & & d_a = -g_a = i x_a^i g_i = - i x_a^ g _ , [ d ] where to get the relations in ( [ d ] ) one should also use gauge invariance of the action .    now in order to find local non - supersymmetric minima of the potential ( [ genpot2 ] ) with small non - negative cosmological constant , we will proceed as in the previous subsection .",
    "first we will impose the condition that the cosmological constant is negligible and fix @xmath20 .",
    "this flatness condition implies that : - 3 + g^i g_i + 12 e^-g d^a d_a = 0 .",
    "[ flatness ] the stationarity conditions correspond now to the requirement that @xmath46 , and they are given by : g_i + g^k _ i g_k + e^-g = 0 . [ stationarity ]    the @xmath27-dimensional mass matrix ( [ vij ] ) for small fluctuations of the scalar fields around the vacuum has as before two different @xmath2-dimensional blocks , which can be computed as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . using the flatness and stationarity conditions ,",
    "one finds , after a straightforward computation @xcite : & & m_i ^2 = e^g - 12 ( g_i - g_i g _ ) d^a d_a -2 d^a g_(i _ ) d_a [ mijbar ] + & & + ( g_(i h_ab ) + h^cd h_a c i h_b d ) d^a d^b - 2 d^a h^bc h_ab(i _ )",

    "- g_i g_j ) d^a d_a+ h^ab _",
    "i d_a _ j d_b [ mij ] + & & -2 d^a g_(i _ j ) d_a - 2d^a h^bc h_ab(i _ j ) d_c + ( g_(i h_abj ) + h^cd h_a c i h_b d j - 12 h_a b i j ) d^a d^b .",
    "we want to analyze now the restrictions imposed by the requirement that the physical squared mass of the scalar fields are all positive . in general the theory displays a spontaneous breakdown of both supersymmetry and gauge symmetries , so in the study of the stability of the vacuum it is necessary to take appropriately into account the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetries . in that process @xmath35 of the @xmath27 scalars , the would - be goldstone bosons , are absorbed by the gauge fields and get a positive mass , so we do not need to take them into account for the analysis of the stability .",
    "nevertheless the would - be goldstone modes correspond to flat directions of the unphysical mass matrix , and get their physical mass through their kinetic mixing with the gauge bosons .",
    "this means that positivity of the physical mass matrix implies semi - positivity of the unphysical mass matrix in ( [ mijbar ] ) , ( [ mij ] ) .",
    "we can use then the same strategy as before but changing the strictly positive condition to a semi - positive one .    in this case there exist two types of special complex directions",
    "@xmath29 one could look at .",
    "the first is the direction @xmath32 , which is associated with the goldstino direction in the subspace of chiral multiplet fermions .",
    "projecting into this direction one finds , after a long but straightforward computation : m^2_i    & & + e^-g , where @xmath49 .",
    "the condition @xmath50 is then the generalization of the condition in ( [ eq ] ) for theories involving only chiral multiplets . in terms of the rescaled variables : f_i ==- g_i , d_a= ,",
    "the flatness and stability conditions take then the following form : @xmath51    again we have that the flatness condition fixes the amount of supersymmetry breaking whereas the stability condition constrains its direction .",
    "one could also consider the directions @xmath52 , which are instead associated with the goldstone directions in the space of chiral multiplet scalars .",
    "nevertheless the constraint @xmath53 turns out to be more complicated and no useful condition seems to emerge from it .",
    "the analysis of the flatness and stability conditions in the case where both chiral and vector multiplets participate to supersymmetry breaking presents an additional complication with respect to the case where only chiral multiplets are present , due to the fact that the auxiliary fields of the chiral and vector multiplets are not independent of each other .",
    "the rescaled auxiliary fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 are actually related in several ways .",
    "one first relation ( consequence of gauge invariance ) can be read from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) and is given by : d^a = f^i [ dfkin ] .",
    "this relation is satisfied as a functional relation valid at any point of the scalar field space .",
    "it shows that the @xmath55 are actually linear combinations of the @xmath54 .",
    "using now the inequality @xmath56 one can derive a simple bound on the sizes that the @xmath55 can have relative to the @xmath54 : |d_a| .",
    "[ df ] there is also a second relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , that is instead valid only at the stationary points of the potential .",
    "it arises by considering a suitable linear combination of the stationarity conditions along the direction @xmath52 , in other words , by imposing @xmath57 .",
    "this relation reads @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : i_i x_a| f^i f^| - m_3/2(3 f^i f_i - 1 ) d_a - d^b + q_abcd^b d^c= 0[dff ] .",
    "these relations show that whenever the @xmath54 auxiliary fields vanish also the @xmath55 auxiliary fields should vanish .",
    "therefore we can say that the @xmath54 s represent the basic qualitative seed for supersymmetry breaking whereas the @xmath55 s provide additional quantitative effects . along this section",
    "we will address the problem of working out more concretely the implications of these constraints . in order to do",
    "so we will concentrate on the case in which the gauge kinetic function is constant and diagonal : @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we can rescale the vector fields in such a way as to include a factor @xmath59 for each vector index @xmath60 . in this way ,",
    "no explicit dependence on @xmath59 is left in the formulas and the metric becomes just @xmath61 . using this",
    "the flatness and stability conditions take the following simple form : @xmath62 where we have defined the quantity @xmath63 measuring the hierarchies between scales . denoting @xmath64 and @xmath65 the relations between @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "read : @xmath68      in this subsection we will study the interplay between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 supersymmetry breaking effects . in order to do so it is useful to introduce the variables @xmath69 . using these variables the conditions for flatness and stability can be rewritten as : @xmath70 where the function @xmath71 is given by :",
    "k(d_a^2,m_a^2 ) = 1 + 4 .    in the limit",
    "in which the rescaled vector auxiliary fields are small ( @xmath72 ) we have that @xmath73 and therefore these variables @xmath74 are the right variables to study the effect of vector multiplets with respect to the case where only chiral multiplets are present .",
    "note that in such a limit the relation ( [ kin ] ) between f and d auxiliary fields can be written at first order as @xmath75 . using this",
    "we get : k1 + 6 ^2_a(m)t_ai| t_ap|q f^i f^|f^p f^|q,_a(m)= , and we can write the flatness and stability conditions as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the net effect in this case is to change the curvature felt by the chiral multiplets .",
    "note as well that in the case in which the mass of the vectors is large this is not necessarily a small effect and can compete with the curvature effects due to the chiral multiplets . actually for heavy vector fields one can check that integrating out the vector fields modifies the khler potential of the chiral multiplets in a way that accounts for this shift in the khler curvature .    for larger values of @xmath55 one can instead find an upper bound to @xmath6",
    "( see @xcite for details ) : k 1 + 6 ^2_a(m ) t_ai| t_ap|q f^i f^|f^p f^|q , _",
    "a(m)=. so in this general case we get as well that the effect of vector multiplets can be encoded into an effective curvature @xmath77 .    in this section",
    "we have derived the implications of the flatness and stability conditions taking into account the fact that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are not independent variables .",
    "the strategy that we have followed is to use the the relation ( [ dfkin ] ) to write @xmath55 in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "a second possibility would be to use instead the relation ( [ dff ] ) to write @xmath67 in term of @xmath66 and a third one would be to impose only the bound ( [ df ] ) to restrict the values of the @xmath67 in terms of the values of @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear that switching from the relation ( [ dfkin ] ) to the relation ( [ dff ] ) and finally to the bound ( [ df ] ) represents a gradual simplification of the formulas , which is also accompanied by a loss of information . as a consequence",
    ", these different types of strategies will be tractable over an increasingly larger domain of parameters , but this will be accompanied by a gradual weakening of the implied constraints .",
    "a detailed derivation of the implications of the flatness and stability conditions when the relations ( [ dff ] ) and ( [ df ] ) are used can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we will apply our results to the typical situations arising for the moduli sector of string models .",
    "the khler potential and superpotential governing the dynamics of these moduli fields typically have the general structure : [ stringk ] k = - n_i ln ( _",
    "i + |_i ) +  , + where by the dots we denote corrections that are subleading in the derivative and loop expansions defining the effective theory .",
    "the khler metric computed from ( [ stringk ] ) becomes diagonal and the whole kahler manifold factorizes into the product of @xmath2 one - dimensional kahler submanifolds .",
    "also the only non - vanishing components of the riemann tensor are the @xmath2 totally diagonal components @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "recall now that when only chiral fields participate to supersymmetry breaking the flatness and stability conditions take the form ( [ fs-1 ] ) , so in this particular case they just read : [ 32 ] |f^i|^2 = 1 , r_i |f^i|^4 < 23 .",
    "these relations represent a quadratic inequality in the variable @xmath80 subject to a linear constraint .",
    "this system of equations can be easily solved to get the condition @xmath81 , which translates into : [ con ] n_i > 3 .",
    "also eqs .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) constrain the values that the auxiliary fields @xmath82 can take .",
    "when a single modulus dominates the dynamics the condition ( [ con ] ) implies @xmath83 ( this result was already found in @xcite in a less direct way ) . for the universal dilaton @xmath84 we have @xmath85 and",
    "therefore it does not fulfill the necessary condition ( [ con ] ) .",
    "this shows in a very clear way that just the dilaton modulus can not lead to a viable situation @xcite unless subleading corrections to its khler potential become large @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the scenario proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the dilaton dominates supersymmetry breaking , can never be realized in a controllable way . on the other hand ,",
    "the overall khler modulus @xmath86 has @xmath87 , and violates only marginally the necessary condition . in this case , subleading corrections to the khler potential are crucial .",
    "recently some interesting cases where subleading corrections can help in achieving a satisfactory scenario based only on the @xmath86 field have been identified for example in @xcite .    in this case where the dynamics is dominated by just one field the khler potential of ( [ stringk ] ) corresponds to a constant curvature manifold with @xmath88 and it has a global symmetry associated to the killing vector @xmath89 , which can be gauged as long as the superpotential is also gauge invariant . by doing",
    "so the potential would get a @xmath1-term contribution that should be taken into account in the analysis of stability , as was explained in the previous section .",
    "in such a situation the flatness condition in ( [ fs-2 ] ) can be solved by introducing an angle @xmath90 and parametrizing the rescaled auxiliary fields as @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in terms of this angle",
    "the stability condition implies : n > .",
    "[ c2 ] from this expression , it is clear that it is always possible to satisfy the stability condition for a large enough value of @xmath93 .",
    "note in particular that eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) implies that when @xmath2 is substantially less than @xmath94 , which is the critical value for stability in the absence of gauging , the contribution to supersymmetry breaking coming from the @xmath1 auxiliary field must be comparable to the one coming from the @xmath0 auxiliary field .",
    "a final comment is in order regarding the issue of implementing the idea of uplifting with an uplifting sector that breaks supersymmetry in a soft way .",
    "it is clear that such a sector will have to contain some light degrees of freedom , providing also some non - vanishing @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 auxiliary field .",
    "models realizing an @xmath0-term uplifting are easy to construct . a basic precursor of such models was first constructed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a variety of other examples have been constructed , where the extra chiral multiplets have an o raifeartaigh like dynamics that is either genuinely postulated from the beginning @xcite or effectively derived from the dual description of a strongly coupled theory @xcite admitting a metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum as in @xcite .",
    "actually , a very simple and general class of such models can be constructed by using as uplifting sector any kind of sector breaking supersymmetry at a scale much lower than the planck scale @xcite .",
    "models realizing a @xmath1-term uplifting , on the other hand , are difficult to achieve .",
    "the natural idea of relying on some fayet - iliopoulos term @xcite does not work , due to the already mentioned fact that such terms must generically be field - dependent in supergravity , so that the induced @xmath1 is actually proportional to the available charged @xmath0 s .",
    "it is then clear that there is an obstruction in getting @xmath1 much bigger than the @xmath0 s ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , if the only charged chiral multiplet in the model is the one of the would - be supersymmetric sector ( which is supposed to have vanishing @xmath0 ) then also @xmath1 must vanish , implying that a vector multiplet can not act alone as an uplifting sector @xcite .",
    "this difference between @xmath0-term and @xmath1-term uplifting is , as was emphasized in the previous section , due to the basic fact that chiral multiplets can dominate supersymmetry breaking whereas vector multiplets can not .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the flatness and stability conditions simplify not only for factorizable khler manifolds but also for some other classes of scalar manifolds that present a simple structure for the riemann tensor .",
    "this is the case for example for khler potentials generating a scalar manifold of the form @xmath95 which arise for example in orbifold string models @xcite , and also for no - scale supergravities and calabi - yau string models @xcite .",
    "in this note we have reviewed the constraints that can be put on gauge invariant supergravity models from the requirement of the existence of a flat and metastable vacuum , following the results of @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in a general @xmath96 supergravity theory with chiral and vector multiplets there are strong necessary conditions for the existence of phenomenologically viable vacua .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "these necessary conditions severely constrain the geometry of the scalar manifold as well as the direction of supersymmetry breaking and the size of the auxiliary fields .",
    "when supersymmetry breaking is dominated by the chiral multiplets the conditions restrict the khler curvature , whereas when also vector multiplets participate to supersymmetry breaking the net effect is to alleviate the constraints through a lower effective curvature .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the @xmath1-type auxiliary fields give a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential , on the contrary of the @xmath0-type auxiliary fields , which give an indefinite sign contribution .",
    "nevertheless one should also take into account the fact that the local symmetries associated to the vector multiplets also restrict the allowed superpotentials .",
    "these results should be useful in discriminating more efficiently potentially viable models among those emerging , for instance , as low - energy effective descriptions of string models .",

    "<S> we study the conditions under which a generic supergravity model involving chiral and vector multiplets can admit vacua with spontaneously broken supersymmetry and realistic cosmological constant . we find that the existence of such viable vacua implies some constraints involving the curvature tensor of the scalar geometry and the charge and mass matrices of the vector fields , and also that the vector of @xmath0 and @xmath1 auxiliary fields defining the goldstino direction is constrained to lie within a certain domain . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the relevance of these results through some examples and also discuss the implications of our general results on the dynamics of moduli fields in string models . </S>",
