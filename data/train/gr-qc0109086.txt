    "we propose a new solution of the ernst equation .",
    "this solution is symmetric in the prolate spheroidal coordinates and depends on one parameter , called @xmath0 .",
    "the construction of the corresponding gravitational potentials , with the help of the boyer - linquist transformation , shows that this solution has not a good asymptotical behaviour for its dragging .",
    "but , by an ehlers transformation followed by an unitary transformation , which introduces two more parameters , an asymptotically flat solution can be easily built .",
    "so , the obtained solution , in boyer - linquist coordinates , depends on three parameters , which are connected , as in the kerr case , to the total mass of the source and its angular momentum .",
    "however , we did not succeed to relate directly this solution to the kerr solution , but we know that such a linck does exist by reason of the uniqueness theorem for the solution with a good asymptotical behaviour and without naked singularity @xcite .",
    "only the extreme black hole of kerr appears as a limit of the proposed solution , and this latter does not present a naked singularity . varying the @xmath1 parameter",
    "allows to show its role in the ergosphere shape .",
    "the ergosphere , which initially has a torus shape , continuously looses its form and finally separates into a two - sheet toroidal surface , progressively exposing more and more the event horizon .",
    "then the penrose process @xcite is no longer able to take place in a domain of the azimuthal angle , for some range of the @xmath1 parameter values .",

    "the ernst equation is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the gradient and the three - dimensional laplacian operators respectively , @xmath17 is the conjugated complex potential of @xmath18 , and in general its solution can be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . among the classical solutions of the ernst equation , we can cite the well known kerr solution @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 nd @xmath24 are real constants satisfying @xmath25 and the tomimatsu - sato solution , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two complex polynomials depending on the kerr parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 and a parameter @xmath29 assuming integer values describing the deformation of the source @xcite . to determine the potentials",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the metric ( 4 ) , the method consists to use the following relation between @xmath6 , the twist potential @xmath30 and @xmath18 , @xmath31 which implies with ( 6 ) , @xmath32 or , equivalently , @xmath33,\\;\\;\\phi = \\frac{\\partial   } { \\partial q}[\\ln ( r^{2}+q^{2})],\\ ] ] where @xmath34 in ( 10 ) , @xmath30 is the twist potential defined up to a constant and related to the dragging @xmath7 by the following differential equations , @xmath35 the potential @xmath7 is obtained by integration of ( 14 ) , and @xmath8 is determined by quadratures .",
    "any solution of the ernst equation is a solution of the einstein equations .",
    "it is easy to verify that a particular rational solution of the ernst equation ( 5 ) is obtained when ( 6 ) has the following expressions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary real parameter . in ( 15 ) we note a symmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , it can be proved , it has not an axymptotically flat behaviour for the potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to obtain a flat asymptotical behaviour ,",
    "a first step is to introduce a second real parameter , @xmath39 , by means of the following particular ehlers transformation @xcite on ( 15 ) , @xmath40 where @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 but , again , it can be proved , the solution ( 16 ) has still not the suitable asymptotical flatness .",
    "then , a second step consists to perform an unitary transformation on @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 an arbitrary complex constant , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 real constants .",

    ", we obtain asymptotically @xmath57 , @xmath58 we see from ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) that the solution now has the good asymptotic behaviour allowing us to interpret the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath45 and @xmath59 as @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , respectively , the mass and the angular momentum of the source , and @xmath63 the angular momentum per unit mass . in the kerr solution ( 7 )",
    "there are two parameters linked by the condition ( 8) . the asymptotical behaviour of this solution imposes @xcite @xmath64 and the condition ( 8) fixes @xmath59 , @xmath65 in our solution , the asymptotical relations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) impose ( 29 ) , but @xmath0 , @xmath45 and @xmath59 are arbitrary , as can be seen from ( 15 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 26 ) .",
    "of course , it is always possible to compare our parameters to those of kerr by putting @xmath66 and assuming @xmath67 .",
    "so , we would have also from ( 8) , @xmath68 however , it is not necessary for us to choose ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) . in general , our solution presents three independent free parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath45 and @xmath59 , whereas the kerr solution presents only one independent parameter , either @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , imposing ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) , does not reduce our solution to the kerr solution .",
    "the differences between both solutions are further studied in the next section .",
    "besides , we note that the solution ( 22)-(24 ) does not belong to the usual tomimatsu - sato solutions @xcite .",
    "the expression ( 22 ) can be written like @xmath69 with @xmath70 , \\\\",
    "d=(1+\\lambda\\mu)^2+(\\lambda+\\mu)^2[q_1(\\lambda+\\mu)+1]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the horizons correspond to the solution of @xmath71 for @xmath72 which is , from ( 35 ) , @xmath73 , or from ( 26 ) , @xmath74 .",
    "these horizons split into the cauchy horizon , with radius @xmath75 , and the event horizon , with radius @xmath76 .",
    "these results are satisfactory since , for any stationary axisymmetric metric , the horizons depend only on the spacetime symmetries .",
    "the equation of the ergosphere surfaces , from ( 34 ) , is @xmath77 , and two cases have to be distinguished .      in this case @xmath77",
    "if , in addition , @xmath79 which imposes two solutions , describing two points , @xmath80 these points , ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) , are the intersections of the @xmath3 axis with the event horizon , @xmath81 , and cauchy horizon , @xmath82 , respectively , belonging to the ergospheres .",
    "it has to be noted that ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) produce , from ( 36 ) , @xmath83 as well , hence there is an indetermination for the ratio @xmath84 .",
    "this indetermination can be raised by studying the limits @xmath85 which produce @xmath86 the limits ( 40 ) are finite and zero , hence these points belong to the ergospheres .      in this case , @xmath88 can be factorized in ( 35 ) , and the equation for @xmath77 becomes @xmath89 which is the equation for the ergosphere surfaces .",
    "it is a fourth degree surface , and for the representation of this surface , it is useful to express it through a parametric representation with the help of a parameter @xmath90 , such that , @xmath91 we can see from ( 42 ) that it is a bounded closed surface for any value of the @xmath92 parameter .",
    "we have plotted some curves , which are intersections of this surface by the meridian plane @xmath93 , for different values of the parameter @xmath94 , as shown in figs . 1 - 10 . these curves present the following interesting features .",
    "* when @xmath95 the aspect of the ergospheres and horizons tends towards the aspect of the kerr extreme black hole ( e.g. see fig.4 of @xcite ) , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "* when @xmath1 increases its value the aspect of the ergospheres remarkably differs from this of a kerr black hole , as shown in figs . 2 - 5 .",
    "specially , we can notice , the surface of the exterior ergosphere becomes double , presenting some thickness being a two - sheet torus .",
    "it is the same for the interior ergosphere .",
    "* for a defined value of @xmath92 , near @xmath96 , the exterior ergosphere opens itself on the axis @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) , as shown in figs .",
    "then the event - horizon becomes naked in a certain angular aperture , whereas the kerr event - horizon is always dressed by the exterior surface of the ergosphere .",
    "thus , on this spatial portion , the penrose process @xcite is no longer able to take place .",
    "this special topology of the ergosphere indicates , also here , a difference with the kerr metric . *",
    "the evolution of the interior part of the ergosphere , for increasing values of @xmath1 , looks intricate , with , particularly , the advent from the center of a new curve , as shown in figs . 3 - 4 , with a four - leaved clover shape , which grows up until to pass beyond the cauchy horizon , as shown in figs . 8 - 9 , which of course vanishes when @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , as shown in fig",
    "this complicated behaviour presents , also here , an important difference with the kerr metric , because in this last case , the cauchy horizon always covers the interior ergosphere .    figs .",
    "110 show the parametric plots of the curves describing the intersections of the interior and exterior ergospheres , defined by eq.(4.1 ) , with the meridian plane @xmath101 for different values of the parameter @xmath0 in the range @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "the vertical axis is z.  the ergospheres are the axisymmetric surfaces which can be generated by rotation of the curves around the z - axis . the event - horizon and cauchy - horizon are also represented ( circles of radius @xmath76 , @xmath103 , respectively ) .",
    "the mass m has been fixed to the value @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath59 is given by eq.(29 ) .",
    "the singularities correspond , when they exist , to curves or surfaces defined by @xmath83 from ( 36 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath105 is a sum of squares and it can vanish only in two cases :      this system of equations is the same as studied in 4.2.1 , and corresponds to the two points ( 38 ) and ( 39 ) of the horizons where @xmath77 . since , after raising the indetermination of the ratio @xmath84 , the limit ( 40 ) is finite and zero , these two points are not singular .      or , equivalently , @xmath109 the polynomial ( 44 ) always has two roots , @xmath110 that gives the two solutions , @xmath111 and @xmath112 the first solution , ( 46 ) , produces @xmath113 , while the second , ( 47 ) , produces @xmath114 , hence it has to be rejected . from ( 46 ) with ( 26 ) , we have @xmath115 which gives @xmath116 , hence the two ring singularities ( 48 ) , which are the solutions for @xmath117 , are inside the cauchy horizon and so , _ a fortiori _ , inside the event horizon",
    ". there are no naked singularities .",
    "it has been proposed a new axially symmetrical stationary vacuum solution ( 15 ) of ernst equation .",
    "unfortunately , this solution does not satisfy the aymptotical flatness . only after performing an ehlers transformation and an unitary transformation",
    ", the solution ( 22)-(24 ) achieves the appropriate physical asymptotical flatness .",
    "three arbitrary parameters were introduced in this process and interpreted from the asymptotical properties of the solution related to the total mass of its source and its angular momentum .",
    "we did not succeed to obtain the kerr limit of the solution , however we know that it does exist because of the uniqueness theorem , since this new solution has asymptotical flatness and does not present naked singularities .",
    "one of the parameters introduced shapes the ergosphere demonstrating big differences to the kerr solution .",
    "when this parameter vanishes the solution becomes the extreme kerr black hole .",
    "we might conjecture that the solution ( 22)-(24 ) represents a distorted stationary black hole as obtained in the static case @xcite .",
