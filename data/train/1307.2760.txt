    "shear banding occurs in a solid material subject to external homogeneous strain ( be it simple shear , compression or extension ) . in some range of the external strain , the material undergoes an instability and the strain becomes localized in narrow bands .",
    "this stress localization is usually followed by the material breaking .",
    "the lowest value of the external strain @xmath1 for which the phenomenon may appear is referred to as the yield strain @xmath2 .",
    "it is quite desirable to provide a comprehensive theory for the computation of @xmath2 from the first principles , especially for the quite challenging case of amorphous solids .",
    "such a theory was obtained recently for the case of 2-dimensional amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to extend this theory to 3-dimensions .",
    "below we consider the model of amorphous solids obtained by quenching a supercooled liquid , which consists of @xmath3 particles in a volume @xmath4 .",
    "the total potential energy of the system is denoted as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of positions of the particles .",
    "the shear banding is easier to understand at @xmath7 and for quasi - static strain . if one develops the theory at these conditions , it is possible to go on and to determine the yield strain at any temperature and any shear rate @xcite . in 2-dimensional amorphous solids it is now well known that the elementary plastic instabilities are seen when an eigenvalue @xmath8 of the hessian matrix @xmath9 hits zero through a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "when this happens , the associated eigenfunction is localized on a two - dimensional quadrupolar structure that describes the displacement field associated with the plastic event : some particles displace into the core of the quadrupole and some displace outward from the core , releasing locally some stress and some energy . this quadrupole - like structure can be modeled by the displacement field of a circular eshelby inclusion that had been strained to an ellipse . below",
    "we demonstrate that this way of modeling can be extended for the case of 3-dimensions . due to large structural fluctuations typical for the amorphous solid",
    ", such elementary plastic event can occur at any value of the external strain @xmath10 . however , the single event is not enough to form the shear band .    when the external strain increases , and particularly when @xmath1 reaches the yield strain @xmath2 , a completely new scenario comes up .",
    "a highly correlated line of such interacting quadrupoles appears simultaneously and causes a drop in energy that depends on the system size .",
    "the displacement field lines associated with this set of quadrupoles , are now connected globally , and the strain is localized in a narrow band . it had been shown in @xcite that this particular arrangement of quadrupoles is a minimal energy solution in which all the quadrupoles are  in phase \" and are aligned at 45@xmath0 to the principal stress axis .    even in view of the above results , it is still unclear what is the fundamental plastic instability in 3-dimensions , let alone what is the nature of the shear - banding instability in 3-d . in this paper we will provide a theory that will clarify these issues when the system undergoes the simple shear strain in a plane ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ simulations ] we present numerical simulations that indicate very strongly that also the 3-dimensional systems under the shear - strain exhibit elementary plastic events that can be faithfully modeled by eshelby inclusions .",
    "these inclusions occur to be spherical inclusions that have been strained in only two dimensions , with one outgoing and one incoming directions .",
    "the third direction ( the @xmath12 direction ) remains neutral .",
    "it is physically reasonable , if one recalls the geometry of an @xmath11 external strain , which creates no net forces in @xmath12-direction . in sect .",
    "[ theory ] we present an explicit solution of navier - lam equations for such inclusions , to provide the analytic form of the displacement field associated with elementary plastic events in 3-d . in sect .",
    "[ numexloc ] we return to the numerical simulations to examine carefully the fist shear localization event that occurs when @xmath13 .",
    "this event is associated with the sub - extensive energy drop .",
    "it means that such an event must contain a _",
    "density _ of the elementary events .",
    "then , it is important to understand how this density is organized in space .",
    "the numerics indicates that the instability at @xmath13 is associated with the tight structuring of @xmath14 elementary plastic events on the triangular lattice in a single plane at 45@xmath0 with the principal stress axis .",
    "to understand this fascinating phenomenon , in sect .",
    "[ energysect ] we compute the energy necessary to create @xmath14 such inclusions in a given order .",
    "we show that the minimal energy for a given density is indeed obtained when these inclusions are arranged on a plane that is in 45@xmath0 with the principal stress and form the triangular lattice . in sect .",
    "[ compare ] we compare the predictions of the analytic theory to numerical simulations . finally in sect .",
    "[ gamy ] we compute analytically the yield strain where the first shear localization event may take place .",
    "[ conclusions ] offers a summary of the paper and some concluding remarks .",
    "for the purposes of our numerical experiments we chose the extensively studied kob - andersen model @xcite as a glass former . this model employs a 80:20 binary mixture of lennard - jones particles referred to as a and b at a total density @xmath15 .",
    "the a and b particles interact via the potential @xmath16 \\ , \\label{uij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath17 were chosen to agree with those in ref .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 are chosen to cut - off the potential at distance 2.5@xmath19 with two smooth derivatives .",
    "the solid samples for our simulations were obtained by cooling a liquid equilibrated at @xmath20 using standard molecular dynamics and then quenching the resulting fluid to @xmath21 at a rate of 6.4@xmath22 in lj units .",
    "the results shown in this article were taken from @xmath23 and @xmath24 , although similar results were obtained for other system sizes ranging from 2000 to 144000 particles .    as discussed above",
    ", we considered the theory for the case of external simple shear because for this case the strain tensor is traceless and thus simplifying some of the theoretical expressions . applying an external shear in atherrmal quasi - static conditions ( aqs )",
    ", one discovers that the response of an amorphous solids to a small increase in the external shear strain @xmath25 ( we drop tensorial indices for simplicity ) is composed of two contributions .",
    "the first is the affine response which simply follows the imposed shear , such that the particles positions @xmath26 change via @xmath27 this affine response results in non - zero forces between the particles in an amorphous solid .",
    "these non - affine forces are relaxed by the non - affine response @xmath28 which returns the system to mechanical equilibrium .",
    "thus in total @xmath29 .",
    "the non - affine response @xmath28 satisfies the exact ( and model independent ) differential equation of the form @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is known as the non - affine force .",
    "the inverse of the hessian matrix is evaluated after the removal of all goldstone modes ( if they exist ) .",
    "when one gradually increases the external strain in this aqs protocol and allows the system to relax to the mechanical equilibrium after every strain increase step , one observes a typical stress - strain curve as seen in fig.[sigvsgam ] and an energy vs. strain curve as seen in fig.[enevsgam ] .",
    "0.5 cm    the individual plastic event in the reported simulation is encircled with a red ellipse and is blown up in the inset of fig.[enevsgam ] .",
    "like all plastic events , also this one occurs when a nonzero eigenvalue @xmath8 of @xmath32 approaches zero at some strain value @xmath33 .",
    "it was proven that this occurs universally through a saddle - node bifurcation such that @xmath8 tends to zero like @xmath34 @xcite . for values of the stress which are below the yield stress the plastic instability",
    "is seen @xcite as a localization of the eigenfunction of @xmath32 , denoted as @xmath35 which is associated with the eigenvalue @xmath8 , ( see fig .",
    "[ elementary ] ) . at @xmath36",
    "all the eigenfunctions associated with low - lying eigenvalues are delocalized , the eigenfunction @xmath35 localizes as @xmath37 ( when @xmath38 ) .",
    "this eigenfunction represents the displacement field associated with the plastic irreversible stress and energy release .",
    "a - priori it is not obvious what is the best eshelby inclusion that would model faithfully the elementary plastic events in 3-d . to shed light on this issue",
    "we identified and isolated the elementary plastic events that occur in our simulations at low value of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ elementary ] we show this elementary event from two angles of view .    0.5",
    "cm    examining these figures we find that the single event is somewhat similar to the two - dimensional one , with one outgoing direction , one incoming direction , and one neutral direction . in subsect .",
    "[ orient ] we will substantiate this finding analytically by showing that this is a minimal energy solution for the three dimensional event under the conditions of simple shear .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of generality , we will offer in the next section a theory in which the eshelby inclusion has three independent directions .",
    "let us consider the spherical eshelby inclusion which is strained into a general ellipsoid whose internal strain tensor can be written in general using three orthogonal unit vectors @xmath39 as : @xmath40 where the eigenvalues @xmath41 are related to the determinant of the deformation tensor @xmath42 @xcite such that @xmath43 volume conservation under the conditions of pure external stress implies @xmath44 . in a linear theory",
    "this volume conservation constraint translates ( to first order in the eigenvalues ) to the demand @xmath45 in addition , for an orthogonal triad of unit vectors @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 we have the relation @xmath49 using the last two relations , eq .",

    "is understood as a system spanning plastic instability in which the elementary plastic events get highly correlated along lines or planes in two and three dimensions respectively .",
    "it is shown that when the external strain is too small , the only possible plastic events are isolated and not system - spanning . when the external strain exceeds a threshold value the elementary events can appear with the finite density , organized as said on lines or planes .",
    "in this paper we found that in three dimensions under simple shear this is still the case , with the third allowed eigenvalue being very close to zero .",
    "this allows a simple and natural arrangement of the elementary events on a plane such that the global connections between them result in the displacement field that streams in one direction above the shear localization plane and in the other direction below it .",
    "it should be mentioned that for relatively small values of the external strain one observes also individual localised plastic events with three independent nonzero eigenvalues . for the scenario of collective instability in the case of relatively large strains",
    "all observed events were effectively two - dimensional , with the third eigenvalue almost equal to zero .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the alignment of the localization plane in 45@xmath0 to the principal stress is particular to the pure shear . for other loading conditions ,",
    "the angle of the shear bands can lie between @xmath174 and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the finding of the predicted triangular lattice in the numerical simulations is yet another supporting evidence to our fundamental assumption of the relation between the small local plastic events and the system - spanning events .",
    "like in two dimensions , it turns out that for pure shear the expression for @xmath157 contains only the poisson ratio and the eshelby eigenstrain .",

    "<S> in this paper we extend the recent theory of shear - localization in 2-dimensional amorphous solids to 3-d . in 2-d the fundamental instability of shear - localization is related to the appearance of a line of displacement quadrupoles , that makes an angle of 45@xmath0 with the principal stress axis . in 3-d </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental plastic instability is also explained by the formation of a lattice of anisotropic elastic inclusions . in the case of pure external shear stress , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this is a 2-dimensional triangular lattice of similar elementary events . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this lattice is arranged on a plane , that , similarly to the 2-d case , makes an angle of 45@xmath0 with respect to the principal stress axis . </S>",
    "<S> this solution is energetically favorable only if the external strain exceeds a yield - strain value , which is determined by the strain parameters of the elementary events and the poisson ratio . </S>",
