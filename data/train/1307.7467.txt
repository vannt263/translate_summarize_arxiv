    "multipoles emerge in the calculation of various quantities in electromagnetism , e.g. , force , torque , energy , radiation and interaction  @xcite@xcite .",
    "this significant and useful concept is a necessary consequence of a series expansion of a function selected according to the quantity to be calculated .",
    "the most common and often dominant multipole is the dipole , and in some cases higher - order multipoles are considered .",
    "multipoles have two sources : electric charge and electric current . for an electrically neutral material with a volume @xmath0 bounded by a closed surface @xmath1 and placed in vacuum ,",
    "the sources of multipole moments are volume and surface densities of polarization charges @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and those of magnetization currents @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if they are independent of time , we write them in si units as  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the effective electric and magnetic polarization density vectors , respectively , and @xmath9 is the outward unit vector normal to @xmath1 . the surface charge and current densities in ( [ echarge ] ) and ( [ ecurrent ] ) should always be present in a real material  @xcite because it is usually bounded by a surface . if @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is a constant nonzero vector inside @xmath0 and is zero outside @xmath0 , the total dipole moment will vanish without the surface term because @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) in the entire space .",
    "it is not a simple task , especially for undergraduate students , to understand the physical meaning of ( [ echarge ] ) and ( [ ecurrent ] ) .",
    "one way to clarify it is to calculate the integral of dipole moment vectors generated from @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "using some vector formulas together with the divergence theorem , we confirm the following  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position vector , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are volume and surface integrals , respectively .    vector identities ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ me ] ) indicate that ( i ) the integrated electric ( magnetic ) dipole moment generated from the polarization charge ( magnetization current ) is correctly given by the volume integral of the electric ( magnetic ) polarization density vector , and ( ii ) if we formally set @xmath18 , the left - hand sides of ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ me ] ) are identical despite their different expressions .",
    "a question arises as to whether ( i ) and ( ii ) can be generalized to multipole moments of any order .",
    "dubovik and tosunyan proved that ( ii ) is true even for a higher - order multipole moment , but they did not consider surface contributions  @xcite .",
    "in the same article there was no mention of ( i ) , probably because multipole moments were expressed by spherical harmonics . to understand the physical meaning of multipole moments , we need to represent them in terms of cartesian coordinates  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we generalize ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ me ] ) , and therefore ( i ) and ( ii ) to a higher - order multipole moment in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the volume and surface integrals of charge - induced and current - induced multipole tensors are calculated first for the symmetric tensor case and then for the symmetric traceless tensor case .",
    "next , we present full surface integral formulations for the volume integral of a multipole moment .",
    "finally , we extend the formulation to introduce another kind of dipole moment generated by an angular momentum operator and discuss its similarity to the charge - induced and current - induced dipole moments .",
    "we show that the angular momentum - induced dipole emerges in some vector decomposition formula .",
    "this article is accessible to undergraduate students with a fundamental knowledge in vector and tensor calculus  @xcite .",
    "we assume a general effective polarization density vector field @xmath19 that is a continuous and differentiable vector function of @xmath15 and is independent of time . @xmath20 only in a volume @xmath0 bounded by a closed surface @xmath1 .",
    "the volume densities of the generalized polarization charge and current are defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding generalized polarization surface charge and current densities are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we assume that there are no free charges and currents in the system studied here .",
    "the @xmath25th ( @xmath26-pole ) cartesian moment of volume / surface _ charge _ density with respect to the origin in @xmath0 is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the volume / surface charge - induced dipole density , and @xmath29 is a cartesian tensor of rank @xmath25 ( @xmath30 )  @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath25th cartesian moment of volume / surface _ current _",
    "density is defined as @xmath31  @xcite , where @xmath32 is termed the volume / surface current - induced dipole density .",
    "( the common current - induced dipole density is @xmath33 . )",
    "a tensor is symmetric if its components are invariant under an interchange of any pair of their indices .",
    "therefore , the charge moment density tensor @xmath34 is symmetric , whereas the current moment density tensor @xmath35 is not .",
    "however , an asymmetric moment tensor @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is any vector , can be symmetrized as follows : @xmath38 in component form , the right - hand side of ( [ sym ] ) is calculated in the following way , where @xmath39 represents a cartesian component of the vector @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( the kronecker delta ) and the repeated subscript implies summation from 1 to 3 : @xmath43 this is a symmetric @xmath44th moment tensor of @xmath37 . from ( [ sym ] ) ,",
    "the symmetric @xmath25th moment tensor of current density is written as @xmath45 .",
    "the ( @xmath25-time ) moment tensor of charge density , which is symmetric itself , is rewritten similar to ( [ sym ] ) by using @xmath46 : @xmath47    let us consider the following differential identity to calculate multipole cartesian moment integrals : @xmath48 by virtue of the divergence theorem , the volume integral of ( [ master ] ) yields @xmath49 or simply @xmath50      we take contractions between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in ( [ masterint ] ) or apply @xmath55 to ( [ masterint ] ) and take the sum over @xmath51 and @xmath53 . in this case , the left- and right - hand sides of ( [ masterint ] ) become @xmath56 @xmath57 again , @xmath58 is used in ( [ 1r ] ) . from ( [ 1l ] ) and ( [ 1r ] )",
    ", we obtain the expression for the @xmath25th moment tensor of the polarization charge : @xmath59 = { \\langle \\ ,   \\bi{q } \\cdot \\bnabla { \\bi{r}^{n}}\\ , \\rangle _ v}. \\label{1fin } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is quite similar to ( [ pe ] ) , which is actually derived from ( [ 1fin ] ) for @xmath60 .",
    "next , we apply @xmath61 to ( [ masterint ] ) , where @xmath62 is a standard anti - symmetric unit tensor of rank 3 .",
    "@xmath63 on the other hand , the integrand on the right - hand side becomes @xmath64 the first term is rewritten as follows : @xmath65 \\nonumber \\\\ *      & = q_j [ \\partial_j ( \\delta_{ii } { \\bi{r}^{n}}+ x_i \\partial_i { \\bi{r}^{n } } ) - \\delta_{ij } \\partial_i { \\bi{r}^{n } } ] \\nonumber \\\\ *      & = q_j \\partial_j ( 3 { \\bi{r}^{n}}+",

    ", we find the following expression for the @xmath25th moment tensor of the polarization current : @xmath69 \\nonumber \\\\ *      & = { \\langle \\ ,   \\bi{q } \\cdot \\bnabla { \\bi{r}^{n}}\\ , \\rangle _ v } - ( n+1)^{-1 } { \\langle \\ ,   \\bi{q } \\cdot \\bi{r } \\triangle { \\bi{r}^{n}}\\ , \\rangle _ v}. \\label{2fin } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] except for the last term including @xmath70 , this is similar to ( [ me ] ) , which is recovered by setting @xmath60 in ( [ 2fin ] ) .",
    "here , we consider transforming ( [ 1fin ] ) and ( [ 2fin ] ) into traceless tensors .",
    "a symmetric tensor @xmath71 of rank @xmath25 ( @xmath30 ) is rendered traceless by the detracer operator @xmath72 defined in  @xcite as follows : @xmath73 } ( -1)^m ( 2n-2m-1 ) !",

    "one can see from ( [ detracer ] ) that the operator @xmath72 generates a linear combination of terms that are derived from the original tensor @xmath71 by replacing and contracting the indices @xmath77 .",
    "we note that integral and scalar differential operators do not affect the sequence of the indices of a tensor .",
    "these two facts show that @xmath72 commutes with the operators @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 in ( [ 1fin ] ) and ( [ 2fin ] ) .",
    "hence , applying the detracer to symmetric tensors ( [ 1fin ] ) and ( [ 2fin ] ) simply changes the symmetric tensor @xmath82 into the symmetric traceless tensor @xmath83 , which is expressed as  @xcite @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath83 is regular at the origin  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath88 vanishes with the use of @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from ( [ 1fin ] ) and ( [ 2fin ] ) , we finally obtain the following expression : @xmath90 = { \\langle \\ ,   \\bi{q } \\cdot \\bnabla { \\bi{r}^{(n)}}\\ , \\rangle _ v } , \\quad ( i=1,2 ) , \\label{totfin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is the general version of ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ me ] ) and a main result of this article .",
    "two conclusions , similar to ( i ) and ( ii ) , are drawn from ( [ totfin ] ) .",
    "( i ) the sum of the volume and surface integrals of the symmetric traceless cartesian moments of @xmath93 and @xmath94 is equal to the volume integral of the symmetric traceless cartesian moment of @xmath19 of the same order .",
    "( ii ) the cartesian multipole moments induced by the polarization charge ( @xmath95 ) and current ( @xmath96 ) are identical after integration for any order .",
    "therefore , it was shown that ( i ) and ( ii ) are correct for a multipole moment of arbitrary order .",
    "according to helmholtz s theorem  @xcite , the vector @xmath19 can be written as a sum of two parts , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the transverse and longitudinal components of @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "they satisfy @xmath100 and @xmath101 . replacing @xmath19 in ( [ totfin ] ) by @xmath98 for @xmath95 and by @xmath99 for @xmath96 ,",
    "we get @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 . adding both sides of ( [ tsurfint ] ) and ( [ lsurfint ] ) yields @xmath105 this is a full surface integral expression for the volume integral of a multipole moment .    here",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , volume integration and the divergence theorem yield an alternative full surface integral form : @xmath110 the same result is also obtained by directly calculating the left - hand side of ( [ surfint1 ] ) using stokes theorem .    equations ( [ surfint1 ] ) and ( [ surfint2 ] ) show that the surface integral of the symmetric traceless cartesian moment of @xmath111 or @xmath112 is equivalent to the volume integral of the symmetric traceless cartesian moment of @xmath19 of the same order .",
    "the advantage of this formula is that only the surface values of a pair , @xmath113 or @xmath114 , are needed to determine the volume - integrated multipole moment .",
