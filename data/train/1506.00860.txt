    "the higgs boson discovery by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has triggered a number of studies on multi - higgs extension of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although the measured higgs couplings show a very good agreement with the sm predictions there is still room for interesting non - sm features to be explored at the next lhc run .",
    "in fact , many multi - higgs models provide interesting scenarios as is the case of the complex two - higgs double model ( c2hdm ) .",
    "the 2hdm was proposed by t.  d.  lee  @xcite as a means to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe by allowing for an extra source of cp - violation in the potential ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the existing experimental data and in particular the one recently analysed at the lhc has been used in several studies with the goal of constraining the parameter space of the c2hdm  @xcite or just the yukawa couplings  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyse c2hdm scenarios where the scalar component of the sm - like higgs yukawa couplings to down - type quarks or to leptons vanish .",
    "the corresponding cp - odd component has to be non - zero for the model to be in agreement with the lhc results .",
    "we will also discuss situations where the yukawa coupling is shared by the cp - even and cp - odd components of the higgs boson .",
    "our approach is driven both by the current measurements and by the predictions for the next lhc run .",
    "the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are at present measured with an accuracy of about @xmath3% .",
    "the expected accuracies for the signal strengths of different higgs decay modes were presented by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations ( see also  @xcite ) for @xmath4 tev and for 300 and 3000 @xmath5 of integrated luminosities .",
    "the predictions for the signal strengths with the final states @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be used to understand how the model will perform at the end of the next lhc run because as shown in  @xcite they reproduce quantitatively the effect of all possible final states in the higgs decay .",
    "therefore , the predicted accuracies for the signal strength lead us to consider situations where , at @xmath9 tev , the rates are measured within either @xmath10% or @xmath11% of the sm prediction .",
    "we note that there is no visible difference in the plots when the energy is changed from @xmath9 to @xmath12 tev as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the allowed parameter space of the c2hdm was recently reviewed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we will briefly describe the c2hdm , a complex 2hdm with a softly broken @xmath13 symmetry @xmath14 .",
    "we write the scalar potential as  @xcite v_h & = & m_11 ^ 2 |_1|^2 + m_22 ^ 2 |_2|^2 - m_12 ^ 2 _ 1^_2 - ( m_12 ^ 2)^ _",

    "we note that all values of @xmath53 and @xmath49 are allowed provided @xmath93 .",
    "we have seen that the precise measurements of the higgs couplings allows us to constrain both the scalar and the pseudoscalar yukawas in the c2hdm . however , a direct measurement of the relative size of the pseudoscalar to scalar coupling is important because it directly probes the higgs couplings to light quarks and leptons . moreover , when combined with edms it can provide universality tests for the cp - odd components of the yukawas .    the angle that measures the pseudoscalar to scalar ratio , @xmath94 ,",
    "is defined by @xmath95 and could in principle be measured for all yukawa couplings .",
    "direct measurements of this ratio in the up - quark sector , @xmath96 , was first proposed in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite . the process @xmath97  @xcite also allows to probe the same vertex as discussed in  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite an exclusion of @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) for a luminosity of 50 fb@xmath100 ( 300 fb@xmath100 ) was obtained for 14 tev and assuming @xmath101 as the null hypothesis .",
    "a study of the @xmath102 vertex was proposed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and a detailed study taking into account the main backgrounds  @xcite lead to an estimate in the precision of @xmath103 of @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) for a luminosity of 150 fb@xmath100 ( 500 fb@xmath100 ) and @xmath4 tev .",
    "the number of independent measurements of @xmath94 one needs depends on the c2hdm yukawa type . for type",
    "i one process is enough since @xmath106 .",
    "for all other types we need two independent measurements . for type ii and ls the planned measurements of @xmath107 and @xmath108 would be enough while for type f we would need @xmath109 .",
    "incompatibility in the measured values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 would exclude both type i and f.     as a function of @xmath110 for type ii and a center of mass energy of @xmath9 tev with all rates at @xmath10% ( blue / black ) .",
    "in red / dark - grey we show the points with @xmath80 and @xmath81 and in green @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "the sm - like scenario sgn@xmath51 @xmath113 is easily distinguishable from the @xmath114 scenario .",
    "in fact , a measurement of @xmath108 even if not very precise would easily exclude one of the scenarios . obviously , all other scenarios in between these two will need more precision ( and other measurements ) to find the values of scalar and pseudoscalar components .",
    "the @xmath115 angle is related to @xmath33 as @xmath116 and therefore a measurement of the angle @xmath108 does not directly constrain the angle @xmath33 but rather a relation between the three angles .",
    "a measurement of @xmath107 and @xmath108 would give us two independent relations to determine the three angles .",
    "the c2hdm , as all models with cp violation , are constrained by bounds arising from the measurement of electric dipole moments ( edms ) of neutrons , atoms and molecules .",
    "the parameter space of the c2hdm was analysed in  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite found that the most stringent bounds are obtained using the results from the acme collaboration  @xcite , except when cancellations among the neutral scalars occur .",
    "these cancellations were pointed out in  @xcite and arise due to orthogonality of the @xmath24 matrix in the case of almost degenerate scalars  @xcite .",
    "the scenarios we discuss have the couplings of the up - type sector ( top quark ) very close to the sm ones . indeed , only the couplings in the down - type sector , namely tau lepton and the b - quark yukawa couplings , are still allowed by data to have a vanishing scalar component .",
    "due to the universality of the lepton yukawa couplings",
    "the electron edm also restricts the tau yukawa . in a type ii model this in turn also restricts the b - quark yukawa of the sm - like higgs .",
    "however , this is completely irrelevant in the flipped model , where the charged leptons couple as the up - type quarks . we have shown in  @xcite that in a preliminary scan over the parameter space we have found points which pass all constraints including acme s .",
    "a dedicated study of the edm contributions in the type ii c2hdm , where there are several sources of cp violation and where the partial cancellations of the various scalars is dully taken into account is in progress  @xcite .",
    "in addition , one should keep in mind that , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the future bounds from the edms can have a strong impact on the c2hdm .",
    "in the future , the interplay between the edm bounds and the data from the lhc run 2 will pose relevant new constraints in the complex 2hdm in general , and in particular for the scenarios presented in this work .",
    "we have discussed the interesting possibility of having a vanishing scalar component is some of the yukawa couplings , namely the couplings of the lightest higgs to down - type quarks and/or to leptons .",
    "these scenarios can occur for type ii , f and ls , and the pseudoscalar component plays the role of the scalar component in assuring the measured rates at the lhc .",
    "a direct measurement of the angles that gauge the ratio of pseudoscalar to scalar components is needed to further constrain the model .",
    "in particular , the measurement of @xmath108 , the angle for the @xmath102 vertex , will allow to either confirm or to rule out the scenario of a vanishing scalar , even with a poor accuracy .",
    "we have also noted that for the type f , only a direct measurement of @xmath117 in a process involving the @xmath118 vertex would probe the vanishing scalar scenario . finally a future linear collider  @xcite will certainly help to further probe the vanishing scalar scenarios .",

    "<S> we discuss the cp nature of the yukawa couplings of the higgs boson in the framework of a complex two higgs doublet model ( c2hdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> after analysing all data gathered during the large hadron collider run 1 , the measurement of the higgs couplings to the remaining sm particles already restricts the parameter space of many extensions of the sm . however , there is still room for very large cp - odd yukawa couplings to light quarks and leptons while the top - quark yukawa coupling is already very constrained by current data . </S>",
    "<S> although indirect measurements of electric dipole moments play a very important role in constraining the pseudo - scalar components of the yukawa couplings , we argue that a direct measurement of the ratio of pseudoscalar to scalar couplings should be one of the top priorities for the lhc run 2 . </S>"
