    "dynamic loading of thin metallic foils is under increasing attention @xcite because it is the way to investigate the matter properties at extremely high strain rates .",
    "plate impact is used for foils perhaps no thinner than 20  @xmath0 m , @xcite while the ultra - short intensive laser irradiation @xcite can be used for foils of several microns in thickness or even thinner ; the strain rate exceeds @xmath1",
    "s@xmath2 in the latter case .",
    "dynamic shear strength and spall strength tend to the theoretical limits at such extreme loading conditions ; @xcite these strengths are determined by inertness of development of the defects subsystems ",
    "dislocations and voids correspondingly .",
    "@xcite    compression waves formed under the laser irradiation in thin foils are treated as ramp waves @xcite with a gradual increase of pressure .",
    "such a wave should eventually breaks to the shock wave during its propagation into the bulk of target , @xcite but it does not happen if the target is thin enough .",
    "the ramp waves can be created by other means as well , for example , using the magnetic pressure . @xcite",
    "if the target is relatively thick and the pressure rise time is high , then the ramp - wave loading becomes nearly isentropic compression of substance because there is no discontinuity inherent to shock waves .",
    "@xcite shortening of the pressure rise time increases the entropy production in the ramp wave @xcite and makes compression closer to that in a shock wave of the same intensity .    on the other hand ,",
    "the shock wave is a discontinuity in analytical solution only for an ideal medium in absence of any dissipation .",
    "shock waves in solids always have a finite rise time , @xcite that means a finite thickness of the wave front , which is determined by the dissipative processes , plasticity first of all .",
    "@xcite the differences from the ramp wave are as follows : ( i ) the unique dependence of the entropy jump upon the pressure or velocity jump , which is determined by the hugoniot relation ; @xcite ( ii ) uncontrolled form of the shock front , which is often supposed to be a steady one .",
    "@xcite the front thickness and strain rate of the steady shock wave are determined by the entropy jump and dissipative properties of the material ",
    "viscosity in fluids and plasticity in solids .",
    "@xcite    an unsteady compression precedes the shock wave formation at both the plate impact and ramp loading . from the mechanical point of view",
    ", the plate impact is a kind of problem of the initial discontinuity break , rather the discontinuity of velocity field .",
    "therefore , an initial strain rate ( velocity gradient ) is mathematically infinite , while physically restricted by the atom size ( like in the molecular dynamics simulations of the impact @xcite ) or roughness and inclination of the colliding metal surfaces . in any case",
    ", the initial strain rate at collision should be much higher than the strain rate at the steady shock .",
    "thus , the shock wave formation at plate impact consists in gradual increase of the compression wave thickness and decrease of the corresponding strain rate with its motion inside the material .",
    "similar to the ramp waves , @xcite the strain rate decrease should be accompanied by the decrease of the entropy production and temperature rise behind the compression wave .",
    "far from the impact surface the entropy increment tends to the jump determined by the hugoniot relation .",
    "near the impact surface the entropy increment should be higher and a high - entropy layer should be formed here .",
    "formation of the shock wave at ramp loading is an opposite process with the gradual decrease of the compression wave thickness down to the shock front thickness ; therefore a low - entropy layer should be formed in this case near the loaded surface .",
    "the transition regions and corresponding high- and low - entropy layers can be negligibly small in comparison with the target thickness in the case of thick target .",
    "meanwhile , those are essential for thin foils , such as used in experiments .",
    "@xcite therefore , formation of the non - isentropic layers should be investigated for adequate analysis of the experimental results . moreover",
    ", the shock wave in solids may have an elastic precursor , @xcite which decays with the distance,@xcite that makes the shock wave unsteady in general .",
    "this feature probably can extend the non - isentropic layers in depth .    in this paper , the high- and low - entropy layers in metals near the loaded surface",
    "are studied numerically on the basis of the dislocation plasticity model .",
    "@xcite the considered surface layers are qualitatively similar to the so called heating errors ( or entropy traces , as in russian terminology ) produced by an artificial viscosity .",
    "@xcite the artificially - introduced viscosity or its equivalent causes a dissipation meant to ensure the stable numerical solution . as a side effect , that leads to non - uniform distribution of entropy and temperature near interfaces after the shock wave propagation .",
    "these non - uniformities are absent in an analytical solution for ideal hydrodynamics , therefore , they are treated as shortcomings of the obtained numerical solution .",
    "non - physical nature of such artificial entropy traces is confirmed by their strong dependence on the numerical mesh size . as opposed to heating error ,",
    "here we communicate about the physical effect caused by real dissipation processes , plasticity , first of all . to exclude the mentioned numerical effect we completely exclude the artificial viscosity , as in refs .  , or , and accounts only physical , mesh - independent , viscosity and plasticity .",
    "the resulting numerical solution is stable if computational grid is fine enough , that means , if the compression wave front is resolved properly .",
    "@xcite    the work structure is as follows .",
    "basic relations of entropy rise in fluids and solids are considered in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . a mathematical model we used",
    "is described in sec .",

    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "as is well - known , the entropy remains constant only in equilibrium adiabatic processes , which should be very slow .",
    "@xcite non - equilibrium leads to the entropy rise : the higher strain rate , the greater degree of non - equilibrium , the higher entropy rise .",
    "different dissipative processes are the particular mechanisms of such entropy rise .",
    "viscosity is the most obvious mechanism of dissipation in fluids . at uniaxial compression or tension of a fluid",
    ", the strain rate equals to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the particle velocity and @xmath5 is the coordinate .",
    "viscous stress is equal to @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the shear viscosity coefficient , @xmath8 is the bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "the dissipating power per unit volume is equal to @xmath9 this power leads to the heat release and the entropy rise with the rate @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the substance density , @xmath12 is the temperature , @xmath13 is the specific entropy .",
    "rate of density change is equal to @xmath14 , from which we obtain the following derivative @xmath15 thus , a small density increment @xmath16 leads to the specific entropy increment @xmath17 , which is proportional to the strain rate .",
    "so , the higher strain rate , the larger entropy rise , at the same final compression ratio .",
    "the entropy jump on a steady shock - wave front is determined only by substance parameters on either side of the shock discontinuity that means , by the hugoniot relation . in turn , the shock - wave thickness and the strain rate on its front are determined by the entropy jump and the substance coefficient of viscosity .",
    "the shock - wave profile becomes steady not instantly after impact : as was mentioned above , an initial velocity gradient ( strain rate ) is formally infinite on the interface between the colliding bodies .",
    "although the gradient value should be physically restricted by various imperfections of the contacting surfaces or by the atomic structure of substance , nevertheless , the initial velocity gradient on the interface is higher than on the steady shock front . therefore , as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the substance near the impact surface should be heated more than immediately behind the steady shock front .",
    "it is the physical reason of the high - entropy layer formation near the impact surface in a viscous fluid or similar matter with dissipation .",
    "similar situation takes place in solids , where an additional dissipation mechanism appears that is the plasticity .",
    "experiments and simulations @xcite on the powerful ultra - short laser irradiation of thin metal foils show that the elastoplastic properties of substance reveal themselves even in the shock waves with the pressure jump of several tens of gigapascals , at least at small target thicknesses .",
    "the high - entropy layer structure can be essential for such thin targets .",
    "the dissipating power due to the plastic deformation per unit volume is determined by the product @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the components of stress deviator , @xmath20 are the components of the plastic strain tensor and @xmath21 are their time derivatives ; the einstein summation convention is used .",
    "this product takes the following form at the one - dimensional deformation , which is typical for plate impact or ramp loading : @xmath22 where the relations @xmath23 and @xmath24 are used , than the entropy rise rate is @xmath25 the plastic strain rate @xmath26 is proportional to the dislocations velocity according to the well - known orowan equation , while the dislocation velocity is approximately proportional to the shear stresses in the over - barrier gliding mode .",
    "@xcite therefore , one can write @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a coefficient of proportionality depending on the dislocations subsystem state , and , inversely , @xmath29 . this proportionality is disturbed at high values of the dislocation velocity , because the latter is bounded above by the transverse velocity of sound .",
    "@xcite the plastic strain should completely balance the external deformation and prevent the shear stress rise at the steady plastic flow ; then one can write @xmath30 ( in particular , that can be obtained from expressions of ref .  ) . in this case",
    ", the entropy rise is linearly dependent on the strain rate : @xmath31 that is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "approximation of the ideal fluid ( without viscosity and plasticity ) is often used at the high - velocity impact modeling .",
    "the corresponding equations system is physically incomplete , which leads to instability of its numerical solution .",
    "one should use artificial viscosity @xcite or its various equivalents to solve this problem .",
    "such artificial dissipation increases the transition layer thickness of a strong discontinuity up to several meshes of the numerical grid .",
    "that simulates the physical viscosity , but the simulation results depend on the mesh size ( for example , the artificial shock thickness ) and consequently are non - physical .",
    "this technique seems to be founded for the gas - dynamic processes , @xcite in which the physical thickness of shock waves is typically much less than the spatial resolution of the numerical grid .",
    "meanwhile , modeling of the shock waves propagation in the condensed matter is often performed on numerical grid with the mesh size smaller than the shock front thickness .",
    "accounting for the physical viscosity and plasticity and elimination of the artificial those are preferable in this case .",
    "@xcite particularly , it is the way to obtain the physically - based structure of the low- and high - entropy layers near the impact surface .",
    "we consider a uniaxial deformation of elastoplastic material ( metal ) , which commonly takes place in the field of interest at the shock and ramp loading experiments . in the framework of continuum mechanics approach ,",

    "a stable profile of the high - entropy layer independent on the mesh size can be obtained only with use of very fine computational grid ( @xmath166  @xmath0 m in the considered case ) . it should be noted that perturbations of flow induced by non - parallelism or roughness of the impacting surfaces can influence on the high - entropy layer formation in the real conditions .",
    "therefore , using of unreasonably fine grids can be senseless for most of the problems , for example , using of the mesh size @xmath155 less than the surface roughness .    according to data from refs .   and",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) , but there is no information about its value .",
    "obviously , the pressure - dependent shear and bulk viscousities of metals should be subjects for further investigations . in the present study",
    ", we use the viscosity coefficient as a parameter of calculations ; this approach is validated in the next section .",
    "like in the previous section ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) , here we solve the problem of symmetric collision of metal plates but with taking into account elastoplastic properties of the material .",
    "the shock wave moves to the right from the collision surface ; the substance behind the shock front is at rest , while the substance before the shock front moves to the left with velocity @xmath142 ; velocity jump on the shock front equals @xmath144 .",
    "comparison of results for symmetric collision of aluminum plates calculated in hydrodynamic and elastoplastic approximations on numerical grid with the mesh size of @xmath174  @xmath0 m is made in fig .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is @xmath175  pa@xmath168s , which value is enough to stabilize the numerical solution but weakly influence on the resulting temperature distribution .",
    "accounting for the elastoplastic properties results in the separation of a shock wave on the elastic precursor and the main plastic wave .",
    "far from the collision surface , the stress component , density and temperature behind the shock front tend to the certain constant values , which are nearly the same for both elastoplastic and hydrodynamic calculations . in the case of elastoplastic calculations ,",
    "the temperature is slightly lower because a part of energy is stored in defects of crystalline structure ( dislocations ) .",
    "that contradicts to the data from ref .  , where an additional heating due to the plastic dissipation had been reported on the basis of calculations",
    "this additional heating had been proposed @xcite as a reason of the higher temperature detected by pyrometric measurements @xcite in comparison with results of hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "we think that the discussed discrepancy is explained by double accounting of the work of deviatoric stress in ref .  : the first time in the equation for internal energy and the second time as additional heating due to the plastic work ; see our comments to eq .",

    "[ fig2]c ) and decreasing of substance density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) near the collision surface @xmath143 at the constant stress ( see fig .  [",
    "the high - entropy layer caused by plasticity is wider and more intensive than the corresponding layer in the case of viscous fluid ; it means that the accounted physical viscosity weakly influence on the calculation results for the elastoplastic medium .",
    "the layer arises in elastoplastic medium due to the higher plastic strain rate near the collision surface in comparison with its value on the steady shock front ( see fig .  [",

    "( [ eq41 ] ) . the shock front thickness in solids",
    "should be determined by both viscosity and plasticity in general , but determination of physically based values of viscosity coefficient @xmath179 require an additional study as opposed to the plasticity effects , which can be calculated on the basis of self - consistent model . @xcite in our present calculations , viscosity coefficient is undefined parameter and we tried to make its influence negligible , but that can not be completely excluded because provides stability of a solution .",
    "accounting for the plasticity solely can not provide the stability because that effects not similarly to viscosity .",
    "the viscosity makes an additional increase of compressive stresses in the substance elements those are compressing faster than other elements and prevents instability , while plasticity only relaxes the stresses .",
    "therefore , determination of the viscosity coefficient in solids is an important topic for further investigations .",
    "calculated temperatures on the collision surface @xmath143 ( in 10  ns after the impact ) and behind the shock wave front versus the particle velocity and the longitudinal stress jumps on the steady shock wave are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the temperatures difference grows with the shock intensity increase at low stresses and can exceed 1  kk . as the pressure is constant behind the shock front ,",
    "melting in the high - entropy layer begins at less values of @xmath144 than after the steady shock wave in the bulk .",
    "aluminum melts near the collision surface at @xmath180  km / s but remains solid in the bulk even at @xmath181  km / s .",
    "subsequent increase of the loading intensity leads to decrease of the temperature difference between the high - entropy layer and the bulk ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) ; it is because the substance melting in the high - entropy layer prevents further plastic dissipation and corresponding heating .",
    "this difference decrease leads to breaks on curves for the collision surface temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; these breaks indicate the beginning of melting in the high - entropy layer near the collision surface ( just after the impact ) .",
    "calculated thickness @xmath182 of the molten layer near the collision surface that is the thickness of molten part of the high - entropy layer is shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] as a function of the particle velocity jump @xmath144 .",
    "after the beginning of melting , this thickness linearly grows with @xmath144 at first , then it becomes equal to the high - entropy layer thickness ( about 25  @xmath0 m ) and ceases to grow .",
    "such behavior corresponds to the temperature distribution in the high - entropy layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "ramp loading is one of the widespread experimental techniques ; it often takes place at laser irradiation , for example .",
    "the ramp loading is modeled as a linear increase of pressure on loaded surface during the rise time @xmath183 , after then the pressure is constant : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the maximal acting pressure .",
    "a metal plate is considered ; the front surface is loaded , while the rear surface is free ; the substance is at rest initially .",
    "temperature fields near the loaded surface are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the case of aluminum loading with the maximal pressure @xmath186  gpa .",
    "various rise times are considered ; zero rise time corresponds to the shock loading ( like at the plate impact ) . at any loading rise time",
    ", an initially unsteady compression wave transforms into the steady shock wave with time .",
    "after this transformation , the temperature behind the compression wave becomes constant ( the steady shock wave level in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . near the loaded surface the temperature is higher or lower than the steady shock wave level , so the high - entropy or low - entropy layers",
    "are formed depending on the rise time .",
    "if the rise time is small , initial strain rate is higher than on the steady shock front and the high - entropy layer is formed ; limiting case @xmath187 corresponds to the results of previous section . on the contrary",
    ", large rise time leads to a lower initial value of the strain rate and the low - entropy layer is formed ; this situation is more common for the ramp loading .",
    "the rise time @xmath188  ns is approximately equal to the thickness ( in time units ) of the steady shock front , and almost flat temperature distribution is formed as a result ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "results of hydrodynamic calculations are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for comparison . in the hydrodynamic calculations",
    ", the temperature tends to the hugoniout adiabat level far from the loaded surface , as well as it tends to the poisson adiabat level near the loaded surface with increase of the rise time @xmath183 .",
    "the temperature behind the steady shock for elastoplastic calculations is slightly lower than in the hydrodynamic approximation and than the hugoniot adiabat level due to expenditure of energy on the formation of new dislocations , as it is mentioned in the previous section . near the loaded surface ,",
    "the temperature is , vise versa , higher for the elastoplastic calculations due to additional dissipation mechanism .",
    "the rise time dependence of the loaded surface temperature is presented in fig .",
    "it is monotonically decreasing with the maximal value corresponding to the zero rise time .",
    "this dependence crosses the hugoniot adiabat level at @xmath189  ns and tends to the poisson adiabat level with increase of the rise time ; thus , compression in the low - entropy layer becomes close to the isentropic one at @xmath190 .",
    "@xcite extension of the rise time also increases the thickness of the low - entropy layer .",
    "non - uniform distribution of temperature can be expected near various interfaces after the shock wave interaction with them .",
    "the reason is the evolution of the shock ( or release ) wave structure at crossing of the interface . at the evolution , the strain rate , the entropy production and the heating vary from point to point .    the temperature field near the rear free surface of aluminum plate after reflection of the shock wave with velocity jump @xmath191  km / s is shown in fig .",
    "far from the rear surface , the temperature tends to a constant level corresponding to the action of steady shock and release waves .",
    "near the surface the distribution of temperature is considerably inhomogeneous .",
    "it has a maximum on depth of about 12  @xmath0 m from the rear surface with temperature increase about 50  k in comparison with deeper layers , while on the surface itself the temperature drops on about 300  k. this temperature drop occurs because the surface layer does not undergo the complete compression as the deeper layers do : due to the finite thickness of the shock front , unloading starts here before the compression is finished .",
    "thus , the low - entropy layer is formed mainly , while the high - entropy layer ( near the temperature maximum ) is also exists .",
    "the last one is formed during the evolution of the unloading wave structure .",
    "interaction of the shock wave with interface between two different materials is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and  [ fig9 ] by the example of copper and aluminum .",
    "the case of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] corresponds to the shock wave crossing from harder material into the softer one , where the reflection of unloading wave happens .",
    "while in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the harder and softer materials are interchanged , and the reflection of shock wave takes place .",
    "temperatures far from the interface correspond to the action of steady shock and release waves . near the interface the low - entropy layer is formed in the harder material ( cu ) , and the high - entropy layer is formed in the softer material ( al ) .",
    "structure of these layers can be more complicated than at the considered above shock or ramp loading .",
    "existence of high- and low - entropy layers near an interface can substantially influence on the pyrometry measurement of temperature as that analyzes radiation from a substance layer near the interface ( for example , near free surface or interface between the studied substance and a window ) , where the temperature differs from that of bulk .",
    "@xcite moreover , the high- and low - entropy layers should be taken into account in such problems , where surface plays an important role , particularly , at loading of thin targets .",
    "theoretical analysis and computations show that the non - isentropic layers arise near the collision surface and other interfaces in problems of shock and ramp loading .",
    "the cause is the formation or transformation of the steady shock wave structure . at impact",
    ", the initial strain rate , entropy production and heating are higher near the collision surface than on the steady shock front ; therefore the high - entropy layer is formed . the distance passed by the compression wave after the impact before its conversion into the steady shock wave is comparable with the shock front thickness , which is controlled by viscosity ( in fluids and solids ) as well as plasticity ( in solids ) .",
    "ramp loading can form the high- or low - entropy layers near the loaded surface in dependence on the pressure rise time , but the low - entropy layer is the most expected .",
    "reflection of the shock wave from a free surface produces a considerable low - entropy ( in general ) layer near the surface ; the particular reason here is that the surface layer does not undergo the complete compression as the substance in the bulk does : unloading starts here before the compression is finished due to the finite thickness of the shock front . at the shock wave crossing the interface between two substances , the low - entropy layer is formed in the higher - impedance material , and the high - entropy layer is formed in the lower - impedance material .    the high- and low - entropy layers",
    "should be accurately taken into account at calculations of the thin targets loading and other situations where surface is important .",
    "for example , melting can occur in the high - entropy layer , while the substance remains solid behind the steady shock wave deeper in the bulk .",
    "another example is the pyrometry measurements , where the temperature perturbations near the examined surface can affect the result .    for accurate calculations of the mentioned effects , one should exclude artificial viscosity or its analogs from the numerical scheme and use the physically based dissipative processes ( the physical viscosity , the plasticity , and the heat conductivity ) for stabilization of the solution instead .",
    "it is all the more actual since the calculations of the shock - wave processes in condensed matter are commonly performed on the fine numerical grids , which allow one to resolve the shock wave structure .",
    "we use the physical viscosity as a stabilizing factor , but the viscosity coefficient plays a role of parameter of numerical calculations here . using a fine numerical grid allows one to obtain a stable solution at arbitrary small viscosity coefficient .",
    "plasticity controls the shock wave thickness and the structure of the non - isentropic layers in the considered situations , those justify our approach . in spite of that ,",
    "the determination of viscosity coefficients in condensed matter is necessary for a physically complete description of the problem .",
