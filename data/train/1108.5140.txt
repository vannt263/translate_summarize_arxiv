    "the anisotropy functional considered there is an entropy theoretic measure of the deviation of a probability distribution in euclidean space from gaussian distributions with zero mean and scalar covariance matrices .",
    "the mean anisotropy of a stationary random sequence is defined as the anisotropy production rate per time step for long segments of the sequence . in application to random disturbances ,",
    "the mean anisotropy describes the amount of statistical uncertainty which is understood as the discrepancy between the imprecisely known actual noise distribution and the family of nominal models which consider the disturbance to be a gaussian white noise sequence with a scalar covariance matrix .",
    "another fundamental concept of i.g.vladimirovs theory is the @xmath1-anisotropic norm of a linear discrete time invariant ( ldti ) system which quantifies the disturbance attenuation capabilities by the largest ratio of the power norm of the system output to that of the input provided that the mean anisotropy of the input disturbance does not exceed a given nonnegative parameter @xmath1 .    in the context of robust stochastic control design aimed at suppressing the potentially harmful effects of statistical uncertainty",
    ", the anisotropy - based approach offers an important alternative to those control design procedures that rely upon a specific probability law of the disturbance and the assumption that it is known precisely .",
    "minimization of the anisotropic norm of the closed - loop system as a performance criterion leads to internally stabilizing dynamic output feedback controllers that are less conservative than the @xmath0 controllers and more efficient for attenuating the correlated disturbances than the @xmath2 ( lqg ) controllers .",
    "a state - space solution to the anisotropic optimal control problem derived by i.g.vladimirov in  @xcite results in a unique full - order estimator - based controller and involves the solution of three cross - coupled algebraic riccati equations , an algebraic lyapunov equation and a mean anisotropy equation on the determinant of a related matrix .",
    "solving this complex system of equations requires application of a specially developed homotopy - based numerical algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic suboptimal controller design is a natural extension of this approach . instead of minimizing the anisotropic norm of the closed - loop system , a suboptimal controller is only required to keep it below a given threshold value .",
    "rather than resulting in a unique controller , the suboptimal design yields a family of controllers , thus providing freedom to impose some additional performance specifications on the closed - loop system .",
    "the anisotropic suboptimal control design requires a state - space criterion for verifying if the anisotropic norm of a system does not exceed a given value .",
    "the anisotropic norm bounded real lemma ( anbrl ) as a stochastic counterpart of the @xmath0 bounded real lemma for ldti systems under statistically uncertain stationary gaussian random disturbances with bounded mean anisotropy was presented in  @xcite .",
