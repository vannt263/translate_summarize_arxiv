    "bent - core liquid crystals exhibit a rich variety of phases with different types of orientational order . at high temperature",
    "they form an isotropic phase , with disorder in all of the molecular axes .",
    "as the temperature decreases they form a nematic phase , in which the long axes of the molecules tend to align up or down along a director @xmath0 .",
    "the transverse orientations of the molecules can then have various types of order in the plane perpendicular to @xmath0 : they might be disordered ( leading to a uniaxial nematic phase ) , or have nematic order ( leading to a biaxial nematic phase ) , or have polar order ( leading to a net polarization ) .",
    "a classic argument of meyer  @xcite shows that polar order of the transverse directions couples to bend variations in the main director @xmath0 . as a result , it is particularly easy to induce polar order and director bend in bent - core liquid crystals , compared with analogous rod - like liquid crystals .",
    "recent research has found two remarkable physical phenomena arising from polar order and director bend in bent - core liquid crystals :    [ [ flexoelectricity ] ] flexoelectricity : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the flexoelectric effect is a linear coupling between polar order and director deformations in the uniaxial or biaxial nematic phase .",
    "an imposed deformation of the nematic director leads to an electrostatic polarization , and conversely , an applied electric field induces a deformation of the nematic director . since the initial discovery by meyer  @xcite",
    ", this effect has drawn great interest due to its possible application in devices such as display panels , actuators , micropower generators , and electro - mechanical transducers for sensing or energy - harvesting uses .",
    "in general , the director deformation might be either splay or bend , but one would expect the bend flexoelectric effect to be dominant in bent - core liquid crystals .",
    "indeed , recent experiments by harden",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite have found that bent - core liquid crystals have a surprisingly large bend flexoelectric coefficient , up to 35 nc / m , roughly three orders of magnitude larger than the typical value of 320 pc / m in rod - like liquid crystals .    for flexoelectricity ,",
    "the key theoretical question is how to explain the large effect found in bent - core liquid crystals , so that it can be exploited for technological application . in a previous paper  @xcite , we conjectured that the large flexoelectric effect is a statistical phenomenon associated with nearby polar phase .",
    "near a polar phase , a nematic liquid crystal is on the verge of developing spontaneous polar order , and hence any deformation of the director should induce a large polar response . in the previous paper",
    ", we explored that concept by constructing a model for splay flexoelectricity in a system of pear - shaped molecules .",
    "it is still necessary to extend the model to the more complex but physically realistic case of bend flexoelectricity in bent - core liquid crystals .",
    "we recognize that experimental measurements of flexoelectricity in bent - core liquid crystals are controversial  @xcite .",
    "regardless of the experimental flexoelectric coefficient in any particular material , we would like to understand what behavior is theoretically possible .    [ [ modulated - phases ] ] modulated phases : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in an influential theoretical paper  @xcite , dozov noted that bent - core liquid crystals have a very low energy cost for bend in the director , and described this low energy cost by a very small bend elastic constant @xmath1 .",
    "he then speculated that @xmath1 could actually become _ negative _ in some bent - core liquid crystals .",
    "( in this case , the free energy would need to be stabilized by higher - order terms in the bend . )",
    "dozov showed theoretically that the uniform nematic phase would become unstable to the formation of a modulated phase , which could be either a _ twist - bend _ or a _ splay - bend _ phase .",
    "related simulations have been done by memmer  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical prediction is now supported experimentally by optical observations of spontaneous periodic deformations in bimesogens  @xcite , and by extensive studies of a liquid crystal dimer , which identify the twist - bend phase using a series of techniques including small - angle x - ray scattering , modulated differential scanning calorimetry , dielectric spectroscopy , and magnetic resonance  @xcite .",
    "for the twist - bend and splay - bend modulated phases , there are two important theoretical questions .",
    "first , how does the elastic constant @xmath1 become negative ; what is the physical meaning of this negative value ?",
    "second , what happens to the polar order in these phases ?",
    "the schematic illustrations in dozov s paper  @xcite clearly show the presence of local polar order , but this polar order is not included in his theoretical formalism .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a theory of polar order and director bend in bent - core liquid crystals , which can explain both flexoelectricity and modulated phases in these materials . for this work",
    ", we use both landau theory and lattice simulations . in landau theory",
    ", we construct a free energy functional in terms of director gradients and polarization . in the uniform nematic phase",
    ", we can minimize the free energy to find the optimal polarization for fixed bend , or conversely the optimal bend for fixed polarization ( or applied electric field ) .",
    "this minimization gives the bend flexoelectric coefficient @xmath2 , as well as the effective bend elastic constant and effective dielectric coefficient .",
    "in particular , it shows the difference between the bare elastic constant @xmath1 and the effective ( or renormalized ) elastic constant @xmath3 . as the temperature decreases toward a critical temperature , @xmath2 increases and @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "below that critical temperature , the uniform nematic phase becomes unstable to the formation of a new phase which has both polar order and spontaneous bend , and hence must have a modulated structure . by minimizing the free energy over variational forms for the director and the polarization , we find that the director configuration is equivalent to dozov s twist - bend or splay - bend phase , and we also determine the accompanying polarization configuration .    in simulations ,",
    "we construct a lattice hamiltonian that generalizes the classic lebwohl - lasher model  @xcite for nematic liquid crystals by including two vectors on each site , which represent the long molecular axis and the transverse direction , respectively .",
    "this model is analogous to our previous lattice model for splay flexoelectricity  @xcite , but now extended to bend flexoelectricity .",
    "we run monte carlo simulations of this hamiltonian in both the high - temperature uniform nematic phase and the low - temperature modulated polar phase .",
    "these simulations give results that are equivalent to landau theory , but without the mean - field and variational assumptions of landau theory . in the uniform nematic phase , they show the increasing flexoelectric coefficient as the temperature decreases . in the low temperature phase ,",
    "they show the structure of the modulated phase , which may be twist - bend or splay - bend , depending on model parameters .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in secs .",
    "ii and  iii , we develop a theory for the flexoelectric effect in the uniform nematic phase , first using landau theory and then lattice simulations . in secs .",
    "iv and  v , we extend the theory to the low - temperature modulated polar phase , now in the reverse sequence of lattice simulations and then landau theory . in sec .",
    "vi we discuss and summarize the conclusions of this study .",
    "finally , in the appendix we show how the lattice model can also be solved using mean - field theory .",
    "to describe the flexoelectric effect in a uniform nematic phase , we must construct the free energy density in terms of the nematic director @xmath0 and the polarization @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that gradients of @xmath0 are small , and @xmath4 is also small , so that we can work to quadratic order in both of these quantities .",
    "( we will go to higher order in a later section , when discussing modulated phases . )",
    "the free energy has three parts :    a.  the free energy of director gradients is just the standard oseen - frank free energy . it can be written as @xmath5 in terms of the splay vector @xmath6 , the twist pseudoscalar @xmath7 , and the bend vector @xmath8 .",
    "b.  polar order does not occur in the uniform nematic phase , and hence it must have a positive free energy cost .",
    "to lowest order , this cost can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an arbitrary coefficient",
    ". there may be several physical contributions to @xmath10 .",
    "entropy makes a positive contribution proportional to temperature @xmath11 , and the electrostatic energy makes another positive contribution independent of @xmath11 . because we are modeling bent - core liquid crystals , we suppose that there are packing considerations that _ favor _ polar order , in competition with entropy and electrostatics .",
    "this packing energy can be modeled by a _ negative _",
    "part of the free energy , proportional to @xmath12 , independent of @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the combination of these effects gives a coefficient @xmath10 that varies with temperature , and can be written as @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath14 is positive in the uniform nematic phase .    c.  following the argument of meyer  @xcite , polar order",
    "is coupled to both splay and bend in the director .",
    "we already considered the splay coupling in our previous paper on splay flexoelectricity  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with bend flexoelectricity , and hence we consider the coupling @xmath15 which favors polar order along the bend direction , perpendicular to the director , and hence describes ordering of the transverse orientations of the molecules .    putting these three pieces together ,",
    "we obtain the total free energy density @xmath16 to quadratic order in director gradients and polar order .",
    "note that the last three terms are a quadratic form in @xmath17 and @xmath4 .",
    "the uniform nematic phase is only stable if the quadratic form is positive - definite , which occurs if @xmath18 .",
    "this condition can be rewritten as @xmath19 or equivalently as @xmath20 below that critical temperature , the uniform nematic phase must become unstable to a phase with director gradients and polar order , which will be discussed in secs .",

    "this distinction is essentially the same as the distinction between the bend coefficient @xmath29 at constant electric displacement @xmath30 compared with @xmath31 at constant electric field @xmath32 , as discussed by castles _",

    "( [ peq ] ) shows that an electric field induces a polarization .",

    ", we should emphasize which quantities diverge and which remain finite at the critical point @xmath23 .",
    "when we apply an electric field in the converse flexoelectric effect , the induced bend and polarization are given by susceptibilities multiplying the field .",
    "these susceptibilities both diverge as @xmath38 , as usual for susceptibilities at a second - order phase transition . likewise ,",
    "if we were to apply a torque that couples directly to the bend , the induced bend and polarization would be given by susceptibilities multiplying the torque , and those susceptibilities would also diverge as @xmath38 .",
    "however , the flexoelectric coefficient @xmath2 is not exactly a susceptibility ; rather , it is the _ ratio _ between bend and polarization , which both diverge at the transition .",
    "this ratio does not diverge , but approaches the finite maximum value @xmath39 . by comparing this maximum value with the bend elastic constant and dielectric constant as @xmath38",
    ", we see that @xmath40 this equation for the maximum flexoelectric coefficient is approximately the same as the limit derived by castles _",

    "@xcite . however , they derive the limit based on arguments about the conservation of energy",
    ". we would not say that it is related to energy conservation , but rather that it is the limit of stability of the uniform nematic phase . beyond that point ,",

    "the mean - field calculation is presented in the appendix , and the results are similar to the simulations presented in this section .",

    "however , this simple configuration can not be extended to give the molecular orientation across a larger system . in general , it is impossible to fill space with pure uniform bend .",

    "to determine the modulated structure of the polar phase , we repeat the simulations of the previous section with three modifications : we use periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , we use a slightly larger lattice of size @xmath111 , and we increase the bend - polarization coupling coefficient @xmath107 to increase the bend , i.  e. reduce the wavelength of the modulated structure , so that a full wavelength will fit in the simulation box . in these simulations",
    "no electric field is applied , so the only polarization is spontaneous order .",

    "his paper does not explicitly consider the polarization modulation , although his sketches suggest a variation in the polarization direction that is similar to our simulation results .",
    "the twist - bend phase has also been visualized in a simulation by memmer  @xcite .",
    "to understand the modulated phases better , we return to the landau theory of sec .",

    "we average the free energy density over the full modulation , and then minimize the average free energy over the variational parameters @xmath138 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "this minimization gives the behavior near the transition , @xmath140 furthermore , the free energy of the splay - bend phase just below the transition is @xmath141    from these results , we see that the uniform nematic phase can become unstable to the formation of _ either _ the twist - bend phase or the splay - bend phase at the critical temperature @xmath23 .",
    "we can then ask which of these modulated phases is more stable .",
    "comparison of the free energies  ( [ ftb ] ) and  ( [ fsb ] ) shows that the twist - bend phase is more stable if @xmath142 , while the splay - bend phase is more stable if @xmath143 .",
    "interestingly , this is exactly the same criterion for the relative stability of the phases calculated by dozov  @xcite .",
    "this criterion is reasonable , because the elastic constants @xmath144 and @xmath145 give the energetic costs of splay and twist deformations , which are required in the splay - bend and twist - bend phases , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a theory for orientational order in bent - core liquid crystals .",
    "the theory combines three parts : the oseen - frank free energy for director gradients , a tendency toward polar order perpendicular to the director , and a coupling between polar order and director bend . in landau theory , the oseen - frank free energy is represented by the @xmath146 terms , the tendency toward polar order by the @xmath10 term , and the coupling by the @xmath147 term . in the lattice model , the oseen - frank free energy is represented by @xmath73 , the tendency toward polar order by @xmath100 , and the coupling by @xmath107 .",
    "either way , the physical conclusions are the same : in the uniform nematic phase , there is a flexoelectric effect , where an imposed bend leads to a polarization , and conversely an applied electric field leads to a bend .",
    "this flexoelectric effect increases as the temperature decreases toward a polar phase . at the critical point ,",
    "the response to an applied field diverges , and there is a second - order transition from the uniform nematic phase into a modulated polar phase . the modulation may have the twist - bend or splay - bend structure , depending on the relative values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .    to compare our theory with the previous work by dozov  @xcite , note that two phenomena occur at the critical temperature @xmath23 : the system transitions from the uniform nematic phase to the polar phase , and the renormalized bend elastic constant @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ k3eff ] ) changes sign from @xmath150 for @xmath151 to @xmath152 for @xmath133 .",
    "dozov would say that the modulated phase is caused by the negative elastic constant @xmath28 .",
    "by contrast , we would say that the modulated phase _ and _ the negative @xmath28 are both caused by the bend - polarization coupling together with the tendency toward polar order . of course , there is no contradiction between these two theories ; they are just different ways of expressing the same physical concept .",
    "our theoretical results can be compared with recent experiments . for the flexoelectric effect ,",
    "the most relevant comparison is with the experiments of harden _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which found a surprisingly large bend flexoelectric coefficient in bent - core liquid crystals , about three orders of magnitude larger than the typical value in rod - like liquid crystals . this observation is at least qualitatively consistent with our concept that bent - core liquid crystals are near an incipient polar phase , and hence are very sensitive to any slight polar perturbations .",
    "however , one aspect of this comparison is confusing . in our theory",
    ", it is easy to understand why the polarization and bend induced by an applied electric field or an applied torque should be very large in bent - core liquid crystals , because these quantities diverge at the critical point . by comparison",
    ", it is not easy to understand why the ratio between induced polarization and induced bend should be very large , because this ratio does not diverge at the critical point .",
    "( the ratio increases as @xmath38 , but only toward a finite limit . )",
    "even so , that ratio is the standard definition of the flexoelectric coefficient , which harden _ et al .",
    "_  found to be surprisingly large .",
    "one possible explanation of this discrepancy might be that the experiment involves local smectic order , which is not included in the theory ; perhaps this smectic order increases the ratio of polarization to bend .",
    "an alternative explanation might be that the experiment is somehow measuring one of the response coefficients that diverges at the critical point and is not actually measuring the ratio of polarization to bend .",
    "yet another possibility might be that the experiment is actually in a modulated polar phase that has not yet been identified .",
    "for the modulated polar phases , the most relevant comparison is with recent experiments that find nonuniform nematic phases in systems of bimesogens  @xcite .",
    "these experiments provide good evidence that the observed modulation is a twist - bend structure , which is an encouraging consistency between theory and experiment .",
    "however , one point is confusing in the comparison with ref .",
    "the experiment reports that the periodicity of the observed stripe pattern is twice the thickness of the cell .",
    "by contrast , the theory predicts that the periodicity should be determined by material parameters , even in the bulk liquid crystal , regardless of the cell thickness .",
    "one possible explanation of this discrepancy might be that surface anchoring modifies the predictions of the theory and fixes the periodicity of the incipient modulation .",
    "such surface effects could be a topic for future research .    as a final point",
    ", we note that the modulated polar phases are locally ferroelectric ; they have spontaneous polar order which leads to electrostatic polarization .",
    "this local polarization is modulated in a helix for the twist - bend phase or a planar wave for the splay - bend phase , and hence it averages to zero globally .",
    "for that reason , it might be difficult to observe in an experiment . in this respect ,",
    "the modulated polar phases are similar to ferroelectric smectic - c * liquid crystals , which _ also _ have local polar order that is modulated in a helix and averages to zero globally . by analogy with ferroelectric smectic - c * liquid crystals , there might be ways to unwind the helix of the twist - bend phase ( or eliminate the wave modulation in a splay - bend phase ) to obtain a structure with long - range polar order .",
    "for example , strong surface anchoring might give a surface - stabilized ferroelectric nematic phase .",
    "this surface stabilization could be another topic for future research .",
