    "we begin with the following lemma .",
    "[ lemmalinear ] any irreducible polynomial @xmath11 in two variables for which there are infinitely many solutions to @xmath113 with @xmath114 must be of the form @xmath115 for some @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "[ lemmacircular ] any irreducible polynomial @xmath11 in two variables for which there are infinitely many solutions to @xmath131 with @xmath114 must be of the form @xmath132 for some @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",

    "the total degree of @xmath124 is the same as the total degree of @xmath11 , so @xmath137 , a constant .",

    "( see @xcite for basic facts concerning the differential topology of real algebraic varieties . ) furthermore , by the implicit function theorem , removing the singularities and @xmath100 from @xmath39 leaves a finite number of @xmath184 arcs , i.e. , diffeomorphic images of open intervals .",
    "( we consider a topological @xmath188 an arc in the obvious way , i.e. , by removing one point . )",

    "clearly , it suffices to prove the lemma for a single one of the resulting arcs , say , @xmath189 .",

    "if we remove the points @xmath210 and @xmath211 from the arc , we are left with a finite collection of arcs on which @xmath212 is @xmath184 , monotone , and defined on an open interval of length at most @xmath213 .",
    "choosing one such interval @xmath214 and letting @xmath215 gives one of the @xmath187 of the desired decomposition : @xmath187 is monotone because @xmath216 the other @xmath187 are obtained analogously .",

    "but then , by bzout s theorem , @xmath11 must be divisible by the equation of the line passing through @xmath221 and the origin , a contradiction .",

    "<S> it is also possible to generalize this idea as follows . for a set @xmath27 and a set of points @xmath12 , define @xmath28 to have @xmath14 as its vertex set and @xmath29 iff @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the definition of @xmath13 coincides with this definition when @xmath31 , at least for @xmath11-general sets @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we say that @xmath32 is `` erds - hajnal '' if there exists an @xmath24 so that , for any @xmath12 with @xmath25 , @xmath28 contains either a complete graph , an independent set , or an induced transitive subtournament of of cardinality @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main question here is : which functions / sets are erds - hajnal ? </S>",
    "<S> by theorem [ geh ] , all polynomials @xmath11 and any semi - algebraic set @xmath32 are erds - hajnal . in the next section , </S>",
    "<S> we prove some basic facts and describe a much larger class of erds - hajnal  sets . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that all sets belonging to the set algebra @xmath33 generated by semigroups in @xmath3 are erds - hajnal . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in light of theorem [ geh ] , it is a natural question to ask whether semi - algebraic sets belong to @xmath34 . in section [ sectionpolynomial ] </S>",
    "<S> , we prove that this is the case for @xmath35 and discuss the situation for @xmath36 . </S>"
