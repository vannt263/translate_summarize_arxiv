    "the eigenvalue problem for @xmath1 hermitian octonionic matrices , henceforth referred to as _ jordan matrices _ , contains some surprises .",
    "notable among these is that , whereas each jordan matrix satisfies its characteristic equation , its real eigenvalues do not .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , each jordan matrix admits six real eigenvalues , rather than three .",
    "however , the eigenvalues divide naturally into two families of three , and the corresponding families of eigenvectors do have the expected properties , such as orthonormality , provided that these properties are properly formulated .    due to the nonassociativity of the octonions",
    ", most jordan matrices also appear to admit eigenvalues which are not real ; several examples were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge there is no known algorithm for finding the non - real eigenvalues of such matrices , nor is it clear how many there are .    in this paper , which is an extension of  @xcite",
    ", we take a different approach . rather than attempt to find the non - real eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a given jordan matrix",
    ", we instead find the jordan matrices which admit a given eigenvector / eigenvalue pair .",
    "specifically , for any vector @xmath2 which is not quaternionic , we use the associator of the elements of @xmath3 as the eigenvalue , and find all jordan matrices for which @xmath3 is an eigenvector with that eigenvalue , which is nonzero by assumption .",
    "we show below that a necessary condition for such matrices to exist is that @xmath4 , and that if this condition is satisfied there is a 6-parameter family of such matrices .",
    "we begin in section  [ octonions ] by reviewing the octonions and their properties , and then briefly summarize some known examples  @xcite of @xmath1 hermitian octonionic matrices with imaginary eigenvalues in section  [ examples ] . in section  [ results ] , we present our new results , which we then summarize in section  [ conclusions ] , where we also propose some further conjectures .",
    "= 3.5 in    we use the standard basis @xmath5 for the quaternions @xmath6 , and we construct the octonions @xmath7 via the cayley - dickson process as @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting multiplication table is neatly summarized by the oriented fano geometry shown in figure  [ omult ] . as is well - known , the octonions are neither commutative nor associative .",
    "writing the components of an octonion @xmath9 as @xmath10 we have @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be assumed without loss of generality to take the form @xmath13 by suitable choice of basis ; we refer to @xmath14 as _ generic octonions_. choosing @xmath15 the associator of @xmath3 is by definition the associator of its elements , that is @xmath16 = [ x , y , z ] = ( xy)z - x(yz )      = 2 x_2 y_3 z_8 \\,k\\ell\\ ] ] with the last equality holding for generic octonions .",
    "we seek solutions of the ( right ) eigenvalue problem @xmath17 where @xmath18 ; in what follows we will consider only the case @xmath19 \\ne 0 $ ] , noting that @xmath20 $ ] is pure imaginary .",
    "any jordan matrix can be written in the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then   takes the form @xmath24    as shown below ,   admits solutions only if @xmath4 , in which case there is a family of jordan matrices @xmath25 which satisfy it .",
    "little is known about solutions of   with non - real eigenvalues .",
    "although the problem of finding real eigenvalues for @xmath1 hermitian octonionic matrices has been completely solved  @xcite , no such solution exists for finding imaginary eigenvalues  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we know of only a handful of explicit examples of families of @xmath1 hermitian octonionic matrices admitting imaginary eigenvalues , such as those given in  @xcite , which are reproduced below .",
    "note in each case that @xmath26 can always be chosen so that the eigenvalue has no real part .",
    "furthermore , in the first example , the eigenvectors have no real part , the associator of each eigenvector is a ( possibly zero ) multiple of @xmath27 , the imaginary direction of the eigenvalue , and this last property also holds for the elements of @xmath28 .",
    "however , the first two properties fail to hold in the second example , while the last property fails in the third .",
    "[ [ example-1 ] ] example 1 + + + + + + + + +    the matrix @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 has , among others , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33    [ [ example-2 ] ] example 2 + + + + + + + + +    the matrix @xmath34 has , among others , the eigenvectors and eigenvalues ,    @xmath35    [ [ example-3 ] ] example 3 + + + + + + + + +    the matrix @xmath36 admits the eigenvector @xmath37 with eigenvalue @xmath38",
    "as already noted , for each example in the previous section , @xmath26 can be chosen so that a given eigenvalue is purely imaginary . more generally ,",
    "the real part of an eigenvalue can be changed by adding a suitable multiple of the identity matrix to the original matrix .",
    "more formally , we have the following result :    the hermitian matrices having a given eigenvector can be divided into families which differ only by ( real ) multiples of the identity matrix .",
    "the imaginary part of the corresponding eigenvalue is the same for each member of such a family , and each family contains a unique member such that the real part of the corresponding eigenvalue vanishes .",
    "[ nonreal ]    if @xmath3 is an eigenvector of @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath39 , then @xmath3 is also an eigenvector of @xmath40 for any @xmath41 , with eigenvalue @xmath42 . in particular",
    ", @xmath3 is an eigenvector of @xmath43 , with eigenvalue @xmath44 .",
    "note that this technique can in general be used to eliminate the real part of only one eigenvalue at a time . nonetheless , any eigenvector with a non - real eigenvalue is also an eigenvector of a closely related matrix with a purely imaginary eigenvalue .",
    "this suggests the following strategy for trying to find eigenvectors with non - real eigenvalues : rather than trying to find eigenvector / eigenvalue pairs @xmath3 and @xmath39 satisfying   for given @xmath25 , with @xmath39 non - real , we will instead seek to categorize the matrices which admit such eigenvalues .",
    "lemma  [ nonreal ] now tells us that we can assume @xmath45)=0 without loss of generality , at least so long as we consider only a single eigenvector .",
    "we will therefore attempt to find the matrices @xmath25 which admit a given vector @xmath3 as an eigenvector , with given eigenvalue @xmath39 satisfying @xmath45)=0 .",
    "motivated by the first example , we will further assume that @xmath39 is a real multiple of @xmath20 $ ] , and we will consider only the case where @xmath20\\ne0 $ ] . finally , by rescaling @xmath25 , the constant of proportionality can be assumed to be @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath47 \\ne 0\\ ] ]    since @xmath20\\ne0 $ ] by assumption , none of @xmath14 can be zero .",
    "in particular , @xmath48 , and it is straightforward to solve   for @xmath49 and   for @xmath50 , yielding @xmath51 inserting these expressions into   reduces   to the form @xmath52    _ if @xmath20\\ne0 $ ] , then @xmath53 , that is , @xmath54 . _    multiply both sides of   on the left by @xmath55 .",
    "the lhs of the resulting expression must be real , since the rhs is , but direct computation shows that the coefficient of @xmath56 on the left is @xmath57 .",
    "since each factor except for @xmath58 is nonzero by assumption , @xmath58 must be zero .",
    "if @xmath20\\ne0 $ ] , then there are no solutions to   unless @xmath4 .    direct computation , as follows .",
    "inserting @xmath54 into  , the @xmath59-component yields @xmath60 . since each factor except for @xmath61 is nonzero by assumption , @xmath62 . in a separate computation",
    ", the @xmath63-component of   can be solved for @xmath64 , yielding @xmath65 inserting the result into the @xmath66-component of  , along with @xmath67 , results in @xmath68 , which forces @xmath69 .",
    "finally , the @xmath70- and @xmath71-components of   can be solved for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , yielding @xmath74 and the result inserted into the @xmath63-component ( along with @xmath75 and the above expression for @xmath64 ) , resulting in @xmath76 , which forces @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 .    _",
    "if @xmath20\\ne0 $ ] and @xmath4 , then there is a 6-parameter family of solutions to  _ .",
    "[ result ]    inserting the above expressions for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath64 , as well as the condition @xmath4 , into   results in a single nonzero component , which can be solved for @xmath78 , yielding @xmath79 as with the equations solved above for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath64 , the relevant coefficients are nonzero under the stated assumptions , so that the given solutions always exist .",
    "we have thus constructed @xmath25 explicitly , with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath26 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 as free parameters .",
    "we have created a method for finding a hermitian matrix @xmath85 which has an eigenvalue relationship with an imaginary vector @xmath2 , with the associator of @xmath3 , assumed to be nonzero , playing the role of the eigenvalue @xmath39 . for our method to be successful , rather than fixing the matrix",
    ", we must begin by fixing the vector @xmath3 , thus fixing @xmath39 as well .",
    "the question we must ask is if the resulting eigenvalue / eigenvector system from our construction method represents a variation of one of the existing three family examples presented by dray , janesky and manogue  @xcite .    the last two eigenvectors in example  1 satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ result ] ( vanishing real part and non - vanishing associator ) , and @xmath26 and @xmath86 can be chosen so that the eigenvalue is precisely the vector associator , as required by our hypotheses .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the corresponding matrix @xmath28 is indeed contained in the 6-parameter family constructed in theorem  [ result ] .",
    "lemma  [ nonreal ] can now be used , along with some obvious renormalization , to construct the matrices @xmath28 for any values of @xmath26 and @xmath86 . in this sense ,",
    "example 1 is contained within our solution method , although our method generates many more solutions  but can not yet handle the first eigenvector shown , whose associator vanishes .    each of the eigenvectors in examples  2 and  3 , however , either has a non - zero real part or a vanishing associator , so that our results do not apply to these cases .",
    "note that in example  2 , although the imaginary part of the eigenvalues is indeed in the direction of @xmath87 $ ] ( the associator of the elements of @xmath88 ) , namely @xmath27 , none of the given eigenvectors has an associator in this direction .",
    "furthermore , in example  3 , the imaginary part of the eigenvalue no longer points in the direction of the matrix associator @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "these examples therefore make clear that the results in this paper represent only the tip of the iceberg ; our assumptions are too restrictive .    by understanding more about the problems encountered in trying to find a characteristic eigenvalue equation for @xmath1 hermitian matrices over the octonions ,",
    "we hope our work will aid in the discovery of a method for finding the imaginary eigenvalues ( if any ) , and their corresponding eigenvectors , for any given @xmath1 hermitian octonionic matrix ."
