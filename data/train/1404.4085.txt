    "a supernova ( sn ) exploding within an optically thick circumstellar medium ( csm ) may have several unique characteristics .",

    "this will lead to shock - breakout events that are more luminous and longer than those from normal supernovae ( sne ; e.g. , falk & arnett 1977 ; ofek et al . 2010 ; chevalier & irwin 2011 ; balberg & loeb 2011 ) .    in a csm with a slowly decreasing radial density profile ( e.g. , a wind profile with density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the radial distance )",

    "while the collisionless shock traverses regions in which the thomson optical depth , @xmath8 , is above a few , the hard x - ray photons can be converted to visible light ( e.g. , via comptonization ; chevalier & irwin 2012 ; svirski et al .",
    "we refer to this as the optically thick interaction phase . in most cases ,",
    "emission of visible light from the optically thick interaction phase will last on the order of ten times the shock - breakout time scale ( e.g. , the time it takes the shock to evolve ) the optical depth is inversely proportional to the radius . ] from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) .",
    "svirski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that the optically thick interaction phase is characterized by bolometric emission with a power - law or broken power - law light curve , with specific power - law indices .",

    "however , in most cases the shock - breakout time scale may be less than several days , and the optically thick interaction phase will thus be short and hard to distinguish in the optical band .",
    "it is possible that later , when the interaction is moving into the optically thin region , the hard x - ray photons traveling inward toward optically thick regions ( e.g. , the cold dense shell ; chevalier & fransson 1994 ) will be partially converted to optical photons .",

    "( 2013d ) showed that for sne having light curves that are powered by interaction , there should exist a specific relation between the shock - breakout time scale , the sn luminosity , and the shock velocity at shock breakout .",
    "for various reasons the shock velocity is hard to measure .",
    "ignoring the shock velocity will introduce considerable scatter into this relation .",
    "however , we still expect a correlation , with a significant spread , between the sn rise time ( i.e. , a proxy for the shock - breakout time scale ; ofek et al .",

    "<S> interaction of supernova ( sn ) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellar medium ( csm ) of a progenitor star can result in a bright , long - lived shock - breakout event . </S>",
    "<S> candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne . </S>",
    "<S> if some of these sne are powered by interaction , then there should be a specific relation between their peak luminosity , bolometric light - curve rise time , and shock - breakout velocity . </S>",
    "<S> given that the shock velocity during shock breakout is not measured , we expect a correlation , with a significant spread , between the rise time and the peak luminosity of these sne . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a sample of 15 sne  iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peak luminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory . </S>",
    "<S> we report on a possible correlation between the @xmath0-band rise time and peak luminosity of these sne , with a false - alarm probability of 3% . assuming that these sne are powered by interaction </S>",
    "<S> , combining these observables and theory allows us to deduce lower limits on the shock - breakout velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the lower limits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected for sne ( i.e. , @xmath1kms@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the suggestion that the early - time light curves of sne  iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> performing such a test on other classes of sne ( e.g. , superluminous sne ) can be used to rule out the interaction model for a class of events . </S>"
