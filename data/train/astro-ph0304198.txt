    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy is a striking example of the process of satellite disruption and assimilation long presumed responsible for populating the galactic halo ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ) .",
    "alternatively , viewed as test particles , a sufficiently complete spatial and kinematical sample of sgr stars can reveal underlying gravitational potentials  tracing the total mass of luminous and dark matter in both sgr and the milky way ( sackett et al . 1994 , johnston et al .",
    "1999b , ibata et al .",
    "2001b ) . since the discovery of sgr ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) there have followed a number of observations ( reviewed below and in section 8) to characterize the distribution and motion of the tidal debris and which have aided models of the disruption of the satellite in the milky way s potential .",
    "early observations were largely restricted to small fields - of - view , but nevertheless painted the general picture of a substantially tidally disrupted satellite distributed across a sizeable portion of the celestial sphere .",
    "however , many issues remain controversial and intertwined , particularly :    * the dark matter content in the bound sgr system , which is integrally tied to the long - term integrity and mass loss rate of the satellite ( e.g. , ibata & lewis 1998 , gmez - flechoso 1998 , gmez - flechoso , fux & martinet 1999 ) . *",
    "the survivability of the sgr system in its present orbit , which , even if it contains substantial dark matter , should not last a hubble time ( velzquez & white 1995 , johnston et al .",
    "solutions to this dilemma range from a fine tuning of the dark matter configuration within the satellite ( ibata & lewis 1998 ) , to an evolving orbit for the satellite ( zhao 1998 , gmez - flechoso , fux & martinet 1999 ) , or the creation of sgr at later times as the daughter product of another , more major merger ( gmez - flechoso , fux & martinet 1999 ) .",

    "* the degree of visible substructure in the halo , which is directly related to the galactic accretion history ( tremaine 1993 , bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2001 ) . for luminous halo stellar populations",
    "some mixture of eggen , lynden - bell & sandage ( 1962 ) and searle & zinn ( 1978 ) formation pictures is typically postulated ( e.g. , see review by majewski 1993 ) , but evidence is increasing that the stellar halo is only weakly phase mixed and highly substructured ( majewski , munn & hawley 1996 , vivas et al .",

    "this analysis reveals a king profile , dsph - like appearance of the central region and extensive , well - defined , trailing and leading sgr tidal tails in the south and north galactic hemispheres . among the remarkable aspects of the sgr tidal debris stream",
    "are its coherence and nearly constant density over 360@xmath0 of orbital longitude and that tidal debris from sgr very likely rains down from the north galactic pole onto the solar neighborhood .",
    "near - ir ( nir ) colors of giant and dwarf stars are degenerate for early spectral types ( @xmath8k7 or @xmath9 ) but become distinct in two - color diagrams for the latest spectral types because of opacity effects ( primarily a minimum in the h@xmath10 opacity at 1.6@xmath11 with modulation by h@xmath12 ) that have a large effect in the @xmath6 band .",

    "subsequent reddening correction eliminates intrisically blue objects that do not satisfy our color selection criteria ( below ) . to account for differential reddening around the galaxy",
    "we have interpolated @xmath16 for each of the selected stars with algorithms and reddening data provided by schlegel et al .",

    "2mass aperture magnitudes are more precise than the psf - fit magnitudes for the brighter ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) stars ( cutri et al .",
    "the photometry used here is exclusively aperture photometry where the quoted photometric uncertainty was @xmath80.06 mag in all three bands .",
    "this strong constraint on photometric accuracy imposes a completeness limit on the 2mass selection used here of approximately @xmath24 , substantially brighter than the 99% survey completeness requirement of @xmath25 .",
    "evaluation of the ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) color - color diagram of the center of sgr permits further refinement of the color selection criteria for sgr m giants .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath28 color - magnitude and color - color diagrams for 2mass point sources in @xmath29 deg@xmath30 areas centered on the center of sgr and in a control field centered on a point reflected across the galactic @xmath31 axis at the same galactic latitude . to make the sgr red giant branch even more clear , we include ( figure 1c ) the results of a statistical subtraction in color - magnitude space of the control field from the sgr center field using the same method as layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) with their aspect ratio parameter @xmath32 .",
    "significant small - scale variations in reddening and population densities mean that the subtraction is not perfect , but the position of the sgr red giant branch ( rgb ) in both figures 1c and 1f are obvious .",
    "and the ellipticity ( @xmath33 ) is about 0.65 , which means that the control field here , though near the minor axis of sgr , is still within a radius that contains a measurable sgr density .",
    "however , that sgr in the field at this radius is about 1% the center , so the presence of some sgr stars in the control field does not effect our interpretation of the cmd here or our analysis of the sgr luminosity function below in figure 21 .",
    "] features related to the milky way bulge ( e.g. , a ghostly rgb and horizontal branch red clump ) are visible in the color - magnitude diagram several magnitudes brighter than the sgr rgb .",
    "the initial selection for m giants is conservative , balancing a desire for a large statistical sample of m giants but with minimal contamination by other stars ( improperly dereddened dwarfs and stars with large photometric errors ; see figure 2a ) , and satisfies ( figure 2 ) :    @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    where all magnitudes are in the intrinsic , dereddened 2mass system .    from a partial survey of the central regions of sgr , whitelock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate that the sgr dwarf galaxy contains of order 100 n - type carbon stars ( a slight underestimate  see discussion of figure 20 below ) . carbon stars , because they have extreme , easily identifiable nir colors , make them a potentially useful tracer of the sgr debris stream ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "however , sgr carbons have a large spread in luminosity and a number are long - period variable ( see figure 19 below ) , which yields large uncertainties in estimated photometric parallaxes relative to the better defined m giant color - magnitude relation .",
    "thus , in this paper we rely predominantly on the much more populous m giants to trace the sgr tidal streams , but include a discussion of the carbon stars in section 8.3 .",
    "the center of sgr is a readily apparent feature of all - sky images of the 2mass point source catalogue already in the public domain ( see , for example , + http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/showcase/allsky/index.html ) .",
    "various aspects of sgr s debris stream also become readily apparent in color - magnitude windows of the point source catalogue that highlight sgr m giants at specific distances .",
    "figure 3 shows two such windows .",
    "several large scale features are evident in figure 3 . some are artifacts of heavy and patchy differential reddening near the galactic plane .",
    "reddening can shift early type stellar colors into the giant star two - color locus ( figure 2 ) .",
    "several prominent extensions from the disk correspond to high latitude dust in the galaxy also seen in iras 100 micron maps .",
    "figure 3 shows sgr debris at varying distances in a great circle around the entire celestial sphere .",
    "the most prominent m giant features , apart from the galactic center and plane , are the magellanic clouds and the sgr center at ( @xmath37 ( discussed in section 4 ) .",
    "stretching from the sgr center itself , southward for a short span and then northward , is a  southern arc \" . in section 6",
    "we explore the distance distribution of the arc and show that it extends physically from the main body of sgr .",
    "the distance modulus of the southern arc is more or less constant for more than 100@xmath0 from the sgr center towards the galactic anticenter",
    ". the arc may , in fact , cross the galactic plane at the anticenter and cross into the northern galactic hemisphere , albeit at very low surface density in m giants .    more than a magnitude fainter than the arc is a spike of m giants extending prominently northward from the galactic center direction .",
    "northern arm \" has a longitudinal gradient in median @xmath7 magnitude , which indicates a growing distance with increasing galactic latitude until reaching the north galactic cap . the brighter magnitude slice in figure 3 shows a subtle , more extended ,  fluffy \" distribution of m giant candidates situated near the termination point of the northern arm .",
    "the fluffy concentration spans several tens of degrees , obviously wider than either the northern arm and southern arc , but with less surface density .",
    "as we show in section 6 , the bright northern fluff represents a severely foreshortened extension of the northern arm . indeed , in even brighter magnitude windows , this",
    " north fluff \" is still present , but is spread out over steradians . at the brightest 2mass magnitudes it encompasses nearly all of the northern galactic hemisphere , as would be expected for a large structure very near the sun ( section 6.4 ) .",
    "the extended , low surface brightness , central regions of sgr lie nearly behind the galactic center , which leads to significant contamination by foreground milky way bulge and disk stars and obscuration by patchy foreground dust .",

    "( 2000 ) identify one at a substantially different density in the northern profile at only six degrees .    despite its rather irregular appearance in optical maps , sgr is most often assumed to be a dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) type galaxy , because : ( 1 ) sgr lacks significant hi ( koribalski , johnston , & otrupcek 1994 , burton & lockman 1999 ) , ( 2 ) it contains both old stars and has experienced extended star formation epochs ( cf .",
    "mateo et al .",
    "1995 ) but is not presently forming strars ( bellazzini et al .",
    "1999b ) , and ( 3 ) like other dsph galaxies , sgr appears to have a rather large @xmath38 ( ibata et al .",
    "alternatively , it is often postulated ( bassino & muzzio 1995 , sarajedini & layden 1995 , layden & sarajedini 2000 ; see also discussion by da costa & armandroff 1995 ) that because the center of sgr appears to coincide with the globular cluster m54 ( ibata et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) that the m54+sgr combination may represent a _ nucleated dwarf elliptical _ galaxy ( zinnecker et al .",
    "1988 , freeman 1993 ) . because sgr exhibits an apparent metallicity gradient with overall higher metallicity in the center ( bellazzini et al .",

    "layden & sarajedini 2000 ) , alard ( 2001 ) postulates a third scenario - that sgr may be more like an lmc - type galaxy with an inner disk , or perhaps a recently disrupted disk .",
    "while other dsph galaxies have been shown to have metallicity gradients ( e.g. , light 1988 , da costa et al .",
    "1996 , hurley - keller , mateo & grebel 1999 , majewski et al .",
    "1999b , harbeck et al . 2001 ) , sgr has among the most young and metal - rich constituent populations for dsph s in the local group .",
    "weinberg ( 2000 ) showed that the stellar disk of a dwarf spiral without a massive dark matter halo , such as the lmc , will be heated by a combination of resonant tidal forcing and precession to form a spheroidal in several gigayears .",
    "recent simulations by mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) confirm this result .",
    "we believe that a consistent and natural interpretation of the disparate facts that follow is that ( 1 ) because sgr was recently undergoing significant star formation , it must have formerly been a dwarf spiral or irregular galaxy , and ( 2 ) a combination of mass loss from tidal encounters and star formation activity has transformed sgr into a dsph and brough it to a point of critical stability .",
    "the 2mass database presents the first opportunity for a large - scale , uniform study of the extended central parts of sgr at nir wavelengths where the effects of reddening are diminished .",
    "these data clarify a number of the above issues regarding the nature of the sgr galaxy .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the distribution of candidate m giants around the nominal sgr center and selected with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this magnitude range excludes strong foreground contamination from brighter galactic bulge / disk stars and a smaller number of likely disk stars at fainter magnitudes ( see discussion of figure 8 below ) .",
    "the nir appearance of sgr is far smoother than that seen in optical starcount analyses ( e.g. , ibata , gilmore & irwin 1995 , ibata et al .",
    "1997 ) : at nir wavelengths the central body of the sgr system closely resembles a dsph galaxy .    to show quantitatively its similarity to the appearance of dsph galaxies",
    ", we fit the least reddened m giant data for the sgr center  that with @xmath44 ( figure 4 )  with two functional forms using the bayesian methods and analytical forms described by ostheimer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : a king ( 1962 ) profile and a power law plus core ( plc ) model .",
    "table 1 and figure 5 summarize these results .    proceeding with such fits to the center of the sgr system",
    "requires careful consideration of the density contribution by the long sgr tidal arms ( figure 3 ) .",
    "a simple king profile fit to starcounts at all positions angles ( figure 5a ) does not properly account for the unbound tidal debris in these arms manifested as a  break \" from a nominal king shape at a major axis radius of about 1300 arcmin ( even more visible in figure 5c and figure 12 below ) .",
    "a model fit primarily along the sgr minor axis minimizes the influence of these tidal arm stars ( situated mainly along the major axis at large radii ) , and yields a king parameterization that fits the observed density well to an equivalent major axis radius of 1500 arcmin ( figure 5b ) .",
    "this king parameterization is given in table 1 .",
    "transferring this king profile , derived primarily from sgr stars along the minor axis , back to the average radial profile from stars at all azimuthal angles ( i.e. , all figure 4 data with @xmath44 ) reveals more clearly the transition from the central sgr configuration to stars in the southern arc , which have a more or less constant surface density along their extent ( see figure 13 below ) , but which present a power law decline when included in the azimuthal profile average ( figure 5c ) . despite the major improvement in the fit of the king profile at interior radii , the position angle ( 100.5@xmath0 versus 104.3@xmath0 ) , the ellipticity ( @xmath45 versus 0.65 ) and the declination of the core ( @xmath46 arcmin ) change only slightly with this fit to the major - axis - truncated data .",
    "a single power law fit to the full azimuthally averaged radial density profile can only accommodate the general character of the density decline ( figure 5d ) , but not the detailed shape of the radial profile ; for example , it ",
    "averages over \" the kink in the density profile discussed above . the mean power law fit ( with @xmath47 ;",
    "see ostheimer et al .",
    "2003 for the precise function of the model ) corresponds at large radii to an @xmath48 decline with @xmath49 , which is overly steep beyond the break near 1300 arcmin , where the data appear to decline more like @xmath50 .",
    "this @xmath50 decline is similar to that observed beyond the king limiting radius of the carina dsph ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the table 1 king and plc model fits yield sgr position angles in the range of those found by previous analyses : mateo , olszewski & morrison ( 1998 ) obtained a position angle of @xmath51 while cseresnjes , alard & guibert ( 2000 ) obtained a pa of @xmath52 .",
    "not surprisingly , both of our model fits find the center of the sgr system to be of high ellipticity , @xmath53 , though not quite as high as the @xmath54 previously reported ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "fits to the centers of several other local group dsph galaxies yield similar ellipticities , e.g. , in and iii ( caldwell et al .",
    "1992 , ostheimer et al . 2003 ) and ursa minor ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 , kleyna et al . 1998 , bellazzini et al . 2002b , palma et al .",

    "2001a , palma et al . 2003 ) and carina ( majewski et al . 2000 ) for which significant tidal disruption has been proposed .",
    "extreme ellipticities compared to the standard for dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , sung et al .",
    "1998 ) already suggests that we are observing systems in a disrupting , transient state .",
    "two differences of the observed versus fitted radial profiles are noteworthy : the presence of a break population ( section 4.2.2 ) and the appearance of a  nucleus \" within about 20 - 25 arcminutes that is elevated above the density trend immediately exterior to this radius .",
    "the centers of the king and plc fits lie within a few arcminutes of the center of the massive globular cluster ngc6715 ( m54 ) at @xmath5518:55:03.3,-30:28:42 ) .",
    "the excess 2mass starcounts over the flat core of the king profile fit might be attributed to the cluster itself , however , ( 1 ) the core , half - light and tidal radii of m54 have been derived ( trager , king & djorgovski 1995 ) as 0.11 , 0.46 and 7.5 arcmin  too small to account for the extent of the excess observed ; and ( 2 ) the metallicity of m54 is [ fe / h]=-1.7 and its age is 14 - 16 gyr ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) , so it should not contain stars as red as the m giants used for the fits ( and shown in figure 4 ) and is thus  invisible \" to our survey ( the tip of the corresponding rgb is at @xmath56_{2mass } = 0.724 $ ] ; bertelli et al .",
    "the 2mass results demonstrate that there is a nuclear condensation in the sgr system that is independent of the presence of the metal poor population typically identified with the m54 globular cluster , whether or not m54 is a distinct stellar system from sgr .",
    "layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) have recently shown that all metallicity sgr populations are clumped around m54 , with the most metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath57 ) and young ( 1 and 2.5 - 3 gyr ) stellar populations particularly so ( see also sarajedini & layden 1995 , marconi et al .",
    "1998 , bellazzini et al .",
    "our finding of a cuspy distribution in the center of the sgr profile is similar to the findings of cseresnjes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who with their various fits also faced problems with the peaked central density of rr lyrae stars . that our highest sgr density is coincident with the position of m54 is consistent with the findings of other large area studies of the sgr center ( ibata et al . 1995 , 1997 ,",
    "bellazzini et al .",

    "but an apparent conundrum remained : even were sgr to contain substantial dark matter  sufficient to account for the observed large central velocity dispersion and suggesting a global @xmath63 at the level of the most extreme cases among the galactic dsph population  it would not be enough to solve the puzzle of how the dwarf could have survived as long as it has in its present orbit .",

    "more prosaic alternatives , albeit ones requiring their own dynamical fine tuning , have been put forward to address the dilemma of a fragile sgr surviving a hubble time .",

    "recently , helmi & white ( 2001 ) claim to find two self - consistent sgr models , one purely stellar (  model i \" , with intial mass @xmath65 m@xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and the other with an extended dark halo (  model ii \" , with initial mass @xmath68 m@xmath66 and @xmath69 ) that , when evolved in the sgr orbit for nearly a hubble time , reproduce all data then available . the tidal radius in their model ii , 10.4 kpc , is similar to the sgr major axis king limiting radius found above ( @xmath70 kpc ) . from being able to identify two viable structural models , helmi & white conclude that a long - lived sgr is not  in any way anomalous \" . however , it should be noted that their models succeed by using a lighter milky way ( asymptotic circular velocity for the flat rotation curve of only 186 km s@xmath71 and mass interior to present sgr location of @xmath72 m@xmath66 ) and more benign sgr orbit ( larger , 70 kpc apocenter and longer , @xmath73 gyr period ) than typically used by previous models .",

    "adoption of a 3:1 axis ratio for the inner shape of sgr ( ibata et al .",

    "the large difference in the derived core radius is likely because we have fit ( figure 5 ) a king profile to the entire system _ and that fit is generally insensitive to the localized central cusp of sgr _ , whereas ibata et al .",
    "use the cusp to define the central surface brightness from which they search for a half - light decrement . in effect",
    ", the table 1 profile fits to the sgr dsph result in a satellite that has an overall structure that is much more distended than typically assumed ; however , as we now show , this extended size begs the question of whether it can actually represent the limits of the _ bound _ sgr core .",
    "interpretations of the central parts of the sgr system range from those where the the bulk of sgr within the @xmath105 kpc  break \" radius is still bound , to models ( velzquez & white 1995 , johnston et al .",

    "indeed , recent models by johnston , choi & guhathakurta ( 2002 ) have shown that break - like features in the radial profiles of tidally disrupting satellites can appear at several times the analytically estimated tidal radius , especially for satellites near pericenter .",
    "based on simple dynamical arguments , we argue that a bound radius with @xmath80 as high as unity seems unlikely .",
    "though only a rough guide , especially in the case of a highly elliptical satellite on a non - circular orbit , the roche tidal limit ( e.g. , equation 3 , king 1962 ) can be used to derive a relationship between the tidal radius and enclosed satellite mass . in this case",
    "we assume a milky way mass interior to sgr s present position of @xmath106 m@xmath66 ( e.g. , burkert 1997 ) , and normalize to the semi - major axis @xmath70 kpc to obtain the approximate mass of sgr within the tidal radius as    @xmath107    clearly , under the presumption that @xmath108 we obtain an extraordinarily heavy sgr . instead , to be conservative , we acknowledge that the sgr core is extremely tidally distorted and presume the _ semi - minor _ axis to be a better representation of @xmath74 , so that @xmath109 ; thus we obtain @xmath110 m@xmath66 and a total @xmath111 . while a comparably high @xmath38 has recently been claimed for the draco dsph based on internal velocity dispersion measures ( kleyna et al .",

    "2001b , aparicio et al . 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , even this mass estimate is likely to be low since , as argued by , e.g. , von hoerner ( 1957 ) and king ( 1962 ) , the effective tidal radius should be calculated at the perigalacticon of the orbit . in any case , that these tidal approximation estimates are substantially at odds with that obtained from the king ( 1966 ) methodology in section 4.3.2 indicates that @xmath112 can not be near unity and casts doubt on _ both _ analyses dependent on this assumption .    on the other hand ,",

    "the problem is exacerbated if the size scale of the bound sgr galaxy is much larger than the expected , hundreds of parsecs radius for the star formation region  as , for example , in the type of sgr contemplated in section 4.3.2  because no secular diffusive mechanism can lead to the acceleration of stars in a dsph galaxy on the required timescales .",
    "on the other hand , escape of stars formed several gigayears ago in a central starburst would have been far easier if , in the course of critical disruption , the sgr tidal radius became of order the size of that starburst region ; thus a present true tidal radius of order a kiloparsec in size or smaller is far more likely than one of order @xmath75 , or even @xmath114 .",
    "m giant escape would be enhanced were the most recent starburst spread out over a rotating disk rather than in a nuclear concentration .",
    "it is also possible that the starburst itself may have contributed to the destruction of sgr .",
    "starburst driven galactic winds have been evoked to explain a number of properties of dwarf galaxies , including typically low metallicities as a result of the loss of enriched gas .",
    "clearly wholesale blowout of gas has not been a characteristic of the star forming processes in sgr , given its multiple populations and age - metallicity relation ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; see table 3 below ) , but even fractional loss of gas in supernova winds would have contributed to drops in the sgr binding energy after each starburst .",
    "this mass loss allows the bound part of sgr , including the starburst region , to expand and makes it possible for young stars to reach the true tidal radius . while outside the scope of the present investigation , the formation of _ m giant _ tidal tails ( sections 5 and 6 ) would seem to provide a rather powerful constraint on full chemodynamical evolutionary models of the sgr system .",
    "until the actual extent of the bound sgr system is definitively established , it will be difficult to establish its true @xmath38 and dark matter content .",
    "obviously , the standard methodology of section 4.3.2 will be an increasingly poor approximation as @xmath74 departs from @xmath75 , though exactly how @xmath38 changes as @xmath112 decreases is not obvious ( it depends on a proper accounting of both the enclosed light and the actual distribution of bound mass ) .",
    "one might also wonder whether the similarity of the sgr radial profile to those of other dsph galaxies translates to a similarity of _ physical state _ in these other systems .",
    "problems with the typical @xmath38 s inferred from central velocity dispersions for _ other _ dsph systems that may not be in virial equilibrium have been discussed by , e.g. , kuhn & miller ( 1989 ) , kroupa ( 1997 ) , gmez - flechoso ( 1998 ) , klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) , majewski et al .",

    "note that the best - fitting plane was not constrained to include the galactic center ; if we assume the galactic center to lie at @xmath149 kpc , this point lies 0.23 kpc from the plane .",
    "had this plane been more inclined to the @xmath150 axis , defining it would have given a new estimate of the distance to the galactic center , which presumably lies in the sgr orbital plane ; unfortunately very little leverage on this is offered in the present configuration .",
    "however this technique may be applicable to other extended halo tidal streams orbiting the galactic center found in the future .",
    "our proximity to the sgr plane is a rare coincidence .",
    "if we adopt the solar position as @xmath151 from the sgr - galactic plane line of nodes , we are closer to the sgr orbital plane during less than 4% of our own orbit around the galaxy .",
    "this number drops to 2% when we consider that it is only on this side of the galactic center that the sgr leading debris arm ( as traced by m giants ) apparently gets near the solar circle ( see sections 6.4 and 9 ) .",
    "our 0.78 kpc distance from the sgr plane is less than half the rms spread in sgr debris about the plane fit above , so that if sgr debris passes within a few kpc of the solar circle , we are very likely to be amidst that debris . sections 6.4 and 9 address the implications of this unusual time in solar system history .    that the sun is not _ precisely _ in the orbital plane leads to perspective effects shown in figure 7 .",
    "only those stars used in the derivation of the best fitting plane and lying within @xmath145 are shown .",

    "this bowing ( seen more obviously in figure 16 below ) explains the differences in derived gc3 poles for northern and southern hemisphere gc3 analyses in section 5.1 .",

    "our results here concur with and _ strengthen _ the similar arguments previously made by ibata et al .",

    "figure 12 , discussed later , shows @xmath154 outliers from the sgr plane and makes this point even more clearly . we review various proposed detections of sgr debris in this context in sections 8 and 9 .",
    "determining the sgr orbital plane , as done in section 5.2.1 , permits us to derive a more natural spherical coordinate system for the interpretation of sgr tidal debris - one with the equator defined by the sgr debris midplane .",
    "two such systems ( table 2 )  one heliocentric and one galactocentric  are useful . in the first , sgr latitudes , @xmath155 ,",
    "are defined by the sgr debris _ projected on the sky as viewed from the sun_.",
    "we adopt a debris midplane ( equator ) corresponding to a pole @xmath156 given by the @xmath148 pole derived above .",
    "sgr longitudes , @xmath157 , are defined to increase in the direction of trailing sgr debris , with the prime meridian , @xmath158 , defined by the longitude of the center of the king profile fit to the center of sgr determined in the previous section .",
    "this first coordinate system is entirely observationally based , but , being sun - centered , preserves galactocentric parallax effects .",
    "the second , _ galactocentric _ spherical coordinate system  where the equator is defined by the sgr plane in equation 8  while immune from galactocentric parallax effects , is , however , subject to scale and random errors in the determination of photometric parallaxes .",
    "we define a galactocentric ( @xmath159 ) system , with @xmath160 taken as centered on sgr , as before .",
    "because the plane does not actually contain the galactic center ( it was not constrained to do so ) , we take as the center of the ( @xmath159 ) system the point in the plane closest to @xmath161 kpc , which is @xmath162 kpc .",
    "table 2 gives the eulerian rotation angles ( under the  x - convention \" ; see , for example , goldstein 1980 ) , ( @xmath163 ) , and the cartesian galactic coordinates of the centers of rotation used to define the two sgr ( @xmath164 ) coordinate systems used here .",
    "note that these systems as adopted are right handed , and therefore determined from the left - handed , cartesian galactic system after the translation @xmath165 .",
    "for some illustration presented here it is convenient and intuitive to leave the intersection of the sgr and galactic plane horizontal , and this is achieved by setting the third euler angle rotation to @xmath166 .",

    "indeed , the angle of this tilt is nearly identical to the angle between the sgr major axis and the normal to the galactic plane ( see figure 7f ) , or a little more than about @xmath176 in each case .",
    "this canting is the rationale for removing the sgr center from our calculation of the best - fitting plane above .",
    "figures 7e and 7f shows how the beginning of the sgr tidal stream emanates from the main body more or less evenly to either side of the debris midplane , despite the tilt of main body of sgr .",

    "this observed canting may provide an additional constraint on dynamical models because torquing of the tidal elongation depends on the details of the non - circular satellite orbital trajectory with respect to the galactic potential .",
    "no other strong gc3 peak appears in the m giant candidate pole counts in agreement with the preliminary analysis of 2mass m giants by ibata et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "this gc3 result only applies however , for that part of the halo within @xmath177 kpc , for streams with substantial extent above @xmath178 , and for tracers obeying the other specific m giant photometric criteria employed here ( for example , equations 2 ) .",
    "however , this result is reconfirmed for _ all _ late type giants ( m giants and carbons ) by our analysis of m giant streams in cartesian coordinates in sections 7 and 8.3 .",
    "in addition , no gc3 peak corresponds to tidal debris from the magellanic clouds , even though the magellanic clouds are copiously populated by such stars ( e.g. , nikolaev & weinberg 2000 ) , and are , by far , the predominant reservoirs of late type giants in the galactic halo . previous analysis of a sample of halo carbon stars by ibata et al .",
    "( 2001b ) suggested the existence of a magallanic carbon star stream .",
    "we note that while our gc3 analysis specifically leaves out the region around the magellanic clouds ( excluding the zone @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) to avoid the interference of a large great circle band dominating figure 6 , any roughly coherent tidal streams extending more than about 25 degrees from the clouds should be apparent as a gc3 peak in that figure .",
    "analysis of the distribution of 2mass starcounts by van der marel ( 2001 ) shows the large magellanic cloud to be elongated by galactic tidal forces , but the lack of any gc3 peaks associated with the magellanic clouds suggests that any tidal forces on them either are not sufficient to create extended streams of extratidal stars , or at least that young , metal rich populations are not presently participating in such streams .",
    "the planar coherence of the sgr debris and the implied sphericity of the galactic potential suggests that other tidal streams in the outer galaxy should also face little precessional smearing , remain spatially coherent for at least several gigayears , and therefore be evident as great circles on the sky .",
    "ibata et al . (",
    "2002a ) have argued that the lack of any other discovered m giant gc3 streams means that the present accretion rate of luminous , low - mass satellites must be very low , and that most of the luminous part of the milky way halo must have been in place more than 3 gyr ago , before the accretion of sgr .",
    "however , this conclusion applies only to systems sufficiently metal - rich to produce m giants .",
    "most halo globular clusters and galactic dsph galaxies contain few if any such stars because they are dominated by old , metal - poor populations ( note , as just one example , the total absence of the four sgr globular clusters in the m giant distribution of the central part of sgr shown in figure 4 ) .",
    "indeed , the sgr center and the magellanic clouds are the only readily identifiable , _ intact _ stellar systems away from the milky way disk within the full sky , 2mass m giant distribution explored here .",
    "thus , the lack of other m giant streams places no limit on the present accretion rate of older , more metal - poor systems .",
    "the celestial sphere projection of m giants in figure 3 gives only a rudimentary sense of the relative distances of sgr tidal features by their apparent brightness .",
    "figure 8 shows the _ planar _ distribution of the dereddened @xmath7 magnitudes of m giant candidates with @xmath181 and @xmath182 as a function of sgr longitude .",
    "figure 9 presents the same distribution in a polar projection .",
    "figures 8 and 9 show directly observed quantities , so are free of interpretation .",
    "both figures show the more complex character of the southern arc and northern arm , and give proof of their contiguous connection : while the two features are on average at different mean @xmath7 magnitudes , projections of the magnitude - longitude trends through the zone of avoidance show that the two features meet at the sgr center , and that they represent the leading ( northern arm ) and counterpart trailing ( southern arc ) tidal tails .    in figures 10 and 11 we present the m giant planar distributions in terms of derived distances from the sun and distances from the galactic center ( tehcnically ,",
    "the latter is the center of the gc system given in table 2 ) .",
    "the m giant photometric parallaxes derived from the absolute magnitude - color relation given in equation 5 .",
    "figures 8 - 11 make clear the leading / trailing tail structure of the sgr dwarf and the rosette nature of its orbit .",
    "figure 11 , which shows the distribution of stars projected onto the presumed sgr orbital plane , gives a particularly clear impression of the rosette shape .",
    "we fit this distribution to a model of the sgr dwarf in the galactic potential in a subsequent contribution ( law et al .",
    "2003 ) , but as a general guide to understanding the overall structure of the tidal arms illustrated in figure 11 we call attention to ibata & lewis ( 1998 ) model k6-a shown in their figure 3 ( a model highlighted more clearly in figure 3 of ibata et al .",
    "though shown in the slightly different ( canted by about @xmath183 ) @xmath152 plane , the overall appearance of the ibata & lewis k6-a model illustration bears great resemblance to the m giant distribution shown in figure 11 ( see also figure 14 , particularly panel c ) .",
    "another useful interpretive guide is figure 8 of helmi & white ( 2001 ) , which shows one of their models in a coordinate system similar to that shown in the top panel of figure 10 .",
    "as may be seen in figures 8 and 9 , the center thread of the southern arc m giants varies by only about a magnitude across the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "the actual mean photometric parallax of this trailing debris tail is ( 1 ) roughly 25 kpc where it attaches to the center of sgr , ( 2 ) slightly less than 20 kpc when it achieves its closest distance to us near the sgp , and then ( 3 ) gets progressively more distant towards the galactic anticenter ( e.g. , @xmath184 kpc at @xmath185 ) .",
    "the galactocentric distance of the southern arc ranges from @xmath186 kpc at the sgr center and a similar distance when it passes beneath the galactic center ( @xmath187 ) to @xmath188 kpc at the galactic anticenter .",
    "the disposition of this trailing tidal arm at longitudes even farther from the sgr center is less clear .",
    "inspection of figures 8 through 11 ( and particularly the bottom panel of figure 10 ) suggests that the trailing arm crosses the galactic plane , since there appears to be a continuation of the sweeping southern arc north of the galactic plane , and an overdensity of points near ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is where our selection of m giants becomes both incomplete and noisy ( see discussion of figure 15 below ) .",
    "a large number of stars appear at @xmath190 at all longitudes , but their reality as m giants , much less sgr m giants , must be considered highly uncertain and remains to be verified spectroscopically .",
    "we address the issue of the length of the tidal tails further in section 6.4 below",
    ".      the northern arm can be seen ( figures 8 - 11 ) to represent the leading tidal debris tail of sgr .",
    "figures 10 and 11 show that the approximate center of the locus of the leading tidal debris arm reaches a mean apogalacticon distance of about 40 kpc around @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "figure 11 makes clear the relationship between the diffuse north galactic cap ( ngc )  fluff \" and the northern arm : the diffuse ngc material apparently represents an extension of the northern arm , which together constitute one  northern loop \" around the galactic center and returning back towards the galactic plane .",
    "the ngc material is more spread out on the celestial sphere simply because it is closer and foreshortened along the line of sight .",
    "figures 8 - 10 show the looping northern arm spreading across the ngc , covering a large angular range when it gets to the smallest distances from us ( see top panel of figure 10 ) .",
    "the top panel of figure 10 gives the strongest impression that debris from the leading arm of sgr orbits back toward the galactic plane near the solar circle : because no distance scaling problem can move stars _ on the celestial sphere _",
    ", that material is seen to either side of @xmath193 ( the direction closest to the north galactic pole ) points to the likelihood of sgr material falling to either side of the solar circle .",
    "in section 5.2 it has been found that the sun lies within a kiloparsec of the sgr orbital plane , a distance well within the width of the sgr tidal debris stream ; thus the actual proximity of sgr debris to us depends on the length of the leading arm and where it crosses the galactic plane on this side of the galactic center if it is long enough to do so . for a variety of reasons , whether and where the northern tidal arm crosses the galactic plane toward the southern hemisphere must still be considered uncertain , because the stars that look to be nearby parts of the leading arm in figures 8 - 11 might also be contributions of m giants from the galactic intermediate population ii / thick disk , bulge , or inner halo , or might even be other substructure .",
    "the following summary points suggest the _ plausibility _ of sgr debris near the sun , but further work is needed to confirm this scenario :    \\1 ) in the fit to the sgr plane in section 5 , we obtained an rms residual of nearly 2 kpc .",
    "while there is a @xmath194% distance smearing imposed from the intrinsic spread about the adopted color - magnitude relation , it is clear that sgr debris girdles the sgr orbital midplane with a total width of 4 - 8 kpc or more .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the southern arc ( at a distance of about 20 kpc ) is 10 - 20 degrees or more wide on the sky ( e.g. , figures 3 , 7d and 12 ) . simplistically assuming a cross - section for the tidal arms too far from circular in shape",
    "would then yield a _ depth _ of the sgr arms _ within _ the orbital plane ( e.g. , that projection shown in figure 11 ) of about the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus , should the leading stream be long enough to reach the galactic plane on this side of the galactic center , and should it do so within several kiloparsecs from the sun , then sgr debris will pass through the solar neighborhood .",
    "\\2 ) though previous models ( e.g. , ibata et al",
    ". 2001b , see , e.g. , their figure 3 ) derive an orbit for sgr similar to that traced by the rosette of debris seen here and predict current passage of leading arm debris through the galactic plane at a mean distance of @xmath195 kpc outside the solar circle , our own best fitting models to the present data set ( law et al .",
    "2003 ) obtain a passage of the center of the leading sgr within two kiloparsecs of the sun .",
    "\\3 ) figures 10 and 11 show the presence of @xmath196 kpc distant m giants stretching from @xmath197 to @xmath198 or more .",
    "an even wider angular distribution at closer distances suggests the passage of leading arm material both exterior _ and _ interior to the solar circle at these distances ( the ngp is near @xmath193 ) .",
    "unfortunately , increased confusion between sgr debris and disk , ipii / thick disk , inner halo and bulge m giants in the inner galaxy means that the exact disposition of the nearby sgr debris requires spectroscopic weeding of milky way contaminants .",
    "\\4 ) the tidal debris model shown by ibata et al .",
    "( 2001b ; their figure 3 ) shows a southern extension of the downward moving northern debris that passes not only through the galactic plane , but also through the trailing debris arm and to larger distances .",
    "such a feature may be the origin of the slight excess of more distant stars ( with @xmath199 ) in the predicted longitude range ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the lower right quadrant of figure 14c ( presented below ) which matches the overall appearance of the ibata et al .",
    "model , shows this apparent excess of more distant stars more clearly .",
    "radial velocities of both very bright and faint m giant stars in each hemisphere would be particular useful for checking whether the above features are consistent with a vertical flow of sgr stars through the nearby galactic plane and onward , past the trailing debris arm .",
    "we discuss recent spectroscopic observations bearing on these subjects in another contribution .",
    "both the length of and density variation along the tidal debris arms of a disrupting satellite system are a function of the duration , strength and overall nature of the interaction with the milky way ( johnston 1998 ) .",
    "figure 12 is an attempt to unwrap the sgr tidal material into a ribbon around the sky to illustrate surface density variations in the sgr tidal arms on the plane of the sky .",
    "the top panel shows the ribbon in celestial coordinates .",
    "only stars lying within 7 kpc of the best fit plane to the sgr debris are shown .",
    "a less distorted projection is one in a sgr coordinate system ( bottom panel of figure 12 ) . in our analysis of density variation with position we concentrate on the morphologically simpler , trailing arm .",
    "moreover , because of its nearly equal distance from us as a function of sgr longitude , the southern arc of sgr provides a facile means by which to measure density / mass loss variations relatively free of the effects of foreshortening .",
    "therefore the natural longitude system to use is @xmath157 , not @xmath201 . to remove the bulk of galactic disk / bulge contamination ,",
    "we only show stars more than 10 kpc from the galactic center ( assuming a galactic center distance of 8.5 kpc ) , more than 15 kpc from us , and with @xmath202 .",
    "to increase the s / n of the tail density , we include bluer m giants by opening our selection criterion to @xmath203 .    in figure 13",
    "we show the numbers of these m giants as a function of @xmath157 position .",
    "counts are shown for tallies within _ slabs _ of various thicknesses centered on the sgr midplane . to isolate those stars in each slab associated specifically with the southern arc , we fit a quadratic function to the photometric parallaxes of all stars in the slab as a function of @xmath157 ( with an iterative rejection of @xmath127 outliers ) . for @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206",

    "southern arc \" tubes now sample random halo volumes associated with the great circle pole @xmath211 .",
    "although nearly as polar as the original sgr plane ( and therefore presumably sampling a similar background galactic halo density law ) , this  background plane \" suffers from the shortcoming that wider slabs centered on it become ever more contaminated by sgr contributions near the galactic plane . in one direction ,",
    "this includes parts of the sgr center , but because we are concerned here with assessing the density of the more diffuse parts of sgr , it is less critical to obtain an accurate accounting of the background near the sgr center ( which has , in any case , been done more properly in the radial profile fits in section 4 ) .",
    "figure 13 includes the derived background counts for the @xmath212 kpc wide slab as representative ; the background is typically about 10% in the tail regions away from the sgr center",
    ". tests of various sized background slabs show that the background level away from the sgr center is fairly constant , at @xmath213(slab width ) per 5@xmath0 longitude .",
    "this adopted background is subtracted in the density plots shown .",
    "both figures 12 and 13 demonstrate that , for the most part , the trailing tidal arm of sgr shows no substantial density variation with longitude , especially over the range @xmath214 . generally , the relative density variation along the sgr tail is steadier than is observed ( odenkirchen et al .",
    "2003 ) in the case of the tidal tails of pal 5 .",
    "the relatively steady sgr tidal tail density suggests a more or less constant mass loss rate for the timescale represented by this portion of the tail .",
    "nevertheless , some small variations in density do appear in figures 12 and 13 .",
    "the density decline at large @xmath157 is in part due to reddening and galactic latitude limitations ( note that the galactic anticenter is near @xmath215 ) .",
    "figures 12 and 13 hint at a slightly higher density of m giants some 25 - 50@xmath0 in longitude downstream from the sgr center .",
    "a smaller , less significant overabundance also appears at @xmath216 .",

    "an apparent widening in the tail at these longitudes is also suggested by figure 12 as well as by the separation of the @xmath219 kpc points from the @xmath220 and @xmath206 kpc points in figure 13 at this longitude compared to other places along the trailing debris tail .",
    "we propose two possible explanations for the existence of this particular density feature :    \\1 ) tidal tail caustics that correspond to the strongest phases of gravitational shocking during the orbit of the parent satellite have been seen in simulations of globular cluster disruption by combes , leon & meylan ( 1999 ) . though transient and made up of a constantly changing set of stars ,",
    "these symmetric ( leading and trailing ) lumps are seen to persist in the cluster models for almost a gyr in the combes et al",

    "if the  hump \" in figure 13 is related to a perigalacticon release event , then a symmetrically placed feature might be expected in the leading tail ; unfortunately , this feature , if it exists , would lie close to the galactic plane , where our data become more confused , though a larger density of stars at @xmath222 is not inconsistent with the data ( see figure 12 ) . that one major  hump \" is seen in the trailing tail",
    "is more or less consistent with the dispersal timescale mentioned above .",
    "however , as discussed in section 4.3 , it is possible that much more than just the hump in the tail may be associated with the last perigalacticon disruption event .",
    "a detailed assessment of the overall structure of the region where the sgr king profile transitions into the tail and the relation of observed features to recent mass loss requires more careful modeling , especially given the many nuances in the structural morphology of satellites that can be induced by tidal disruption ( johnston , choi & guhathakurta 2002 ) .",

    "the presence of overlapping leading arm debris could also lead to the observed widening of the apparent trailing arm at this point either through foreshortening or precessional displacement of the leading arm material compared to the true trailing arm stars .",

    "however because the main body of sgr is canted somewhat with respect to the mean trend of the debris , and because mateo et al . extrapolated their outer fields from the direction of the major axis of the sgr center , their outer fields progressively fall away from the center of the debris stream ( see figure 12 and figure 7f , where the @xmath224 mateo et al .",
    "point corresponds to a location about 12 kpc below the sgr center ) .",
    "the lengths of the sgr tidal debris arms are of interest not only because they bears on the question of the duration of the mass loss process , but because of the issue of whether the leading tail is long enough to reach the solar neighborhood .",
    "as described earlier , uncertainty over the length of the leading tail is complicated by contamination by thick disk , bulge and other m giants at low galactic latitudes , and the possibility of tail overlap below the galactic plane .",
    "it would be useful , therefore , if the length of the southern tail could serve as a guide .",
    "section 6.2 offered evidence that the southern arc may extend to the northern hemisphere at the galactic anticenter , but confidence in this result is limited by increased magnitude errors at large @xmath7 , which makes selection of m giants both incomplete and more contaminated by  false positives \" .",
    "figure 14 demonstrates the latter problem with planar distributions of giant star candidates binned by @xmath225 color .",
    "figure 14a shows the spatial distribution of stars in the color range @xmath226 , and quite evident is a  shell \" of excess , presumably contaminating stars introduced at the nominal photometric parallax limit ( @xmath227 kpc ) of stars of this color range .",
    "since for the same apparent magnitude error limit redder giant candidates are projected to greater distances , we see how the shell of excess contaminants is larger in the @xmath228 color bin shown in figure 14b , and expands outward with color until , for stars redder than @xmath229 , the contaminating shell is outside the distance range shown .",
    "the distance progression of these  contamination shells \" with @xmath225 color is illustrated in figure 15 , where we have shown starcounts as a function of distance for four @xmath225 color bins within a cone selected to be more or less free of sgr stars and the magellanic clouds  specifically @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 , where the latter limit is used to avoid much of the galactic disk ; figure 16 is a useful aid for orientation to this wedge .",
    "the peak of the  contamination shell \" for @xmath233 is plainly visible at a distance of about 35 kpc , for example , and at 47 kpc for @xmath234 . only for @xmath235",
    "is the outer limit of the northern loop confidently free of significant contamination when viewed ( as in figure 14 ) in projections of density within a slab of finite width ( note that in contrast the counts shown in figure 15 are for a volume element increasing as the cube of the distance ) .",
    "convolved and competing with the above technical problem of determining the true length of the sgr tidal arms is a second complication arising from stellar population considerations : m type red giant stars occur only in metal - rich populations .",
    "while the sgr center has ample numbers of sufficiently metal - enriched stars to create a substantial m giant population , the sgr metallicity gradient found by alard ( 2001 ) suggests that the tidal debris leaving the sgr dwarf now is likely to be , on average , more metal poor than that remaining in the most central regions .",
    "moreover , layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) have demonstrated a clear age - metallicity relationship among the sgr populations .",
    "thus , one might expect a natural limit to the extent that the sgr tidal tails _ could _ be traced with m giants , with that limit corresponding to the oldest possible tidal debris that can contain m giants .    in table 3",
    "we give the age - metallicity characteristics of the three primary sgr populations identified by layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) .",
    "for each of these populations we use the isochrones and other data in bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to determine the @xmath236 color of the rgb tip , accounting for the conversion to the 2mass photometric system using the equations in carpenter ( 2001 ) . as may be seen",
    ", the most metal - poor population in the sgr system is virtually invisible to the color - selected m giant candidate sample shown in figures 8 - 11 ( recall the invisibility of the m54 globular cluster in figure 4 ) .",
    "thus , uncovering the distribution of these older detached giant star populations requires use of earlier and intrinsically fainter giant stars , but doing so with 2mass , as shown in figure 14a , is complicated by the severe contamination at distances of particular interest . on the other hand , younger populations will have had less time to separate from the sgr core .",
    "therefore , the apparently decreasing length of both leading and trailing m giant tidal tails as we map them with progressively cooler giant star tracers ( figure 14 ) suggests _ a mean stellar age / metallicity variation along the tidal tails_.    the actual tidal release age of any particular part of the sgr arms as deduced from the apparently youngest stars is an upper limit because ( 1 ) the steepness of the luminosity function means that the incidence of stars at the actual tip of the rgb is relative rare , so that any particular m giant is likely blueward of the rgb - tip color for its age / metallicity population ( table 3 ) , and ( 2 ) presumably stars created from residual , bound gas in the core are not instantaneously released but must first somehow find themselves outside the tidal boundary ( see section 4.3.4 ) .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to suspect that the m giant population explored in this paper is actually tracing only the very most recently lost stars ( perhaps only the last several gigayears or so ) from what may be a longer tidal interaction and net tidal arm length . such youthful ages for the length of tails reported here are consistent with sgr disruption models ( e.g. , johnston et al .",
    "1999a , law et al . 2003 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the highly tuned samples shown in figures 14b-14d offer the strongest evidence that the trailing sgr arm is at least long enough to presently lie across the galactic plane in the northen galactic hemisphere towards the galactic anticenter .",
    "if so , then sgr disruption models ( e.g. , law et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that the corresponding leading arm can be long enough to reach the galactic plane on this side of the galactic center .",
    "moreover , figure 14c ( in particular ) offers tantalizing evidence that the _ leading _ sgr arm may extend not only beyond the galactic plane but beyond the trailing sgr arm as well : the  spray \" of stars in the lower right quadrant of the orbital plane is similar to the wrapped , leading arm stars shown in the k6-a model of ibata et al .",
    "2001b ( see their figure 3 ) and the model shown in figure 1 of law et al .",
    "the longitudinal profile in figure 13 enables an estimate of the fractional mass of the sgr system in its tidal arms under the assumption that the m giants provide a suitable and equitable tracer over the entire sgr + tail system . presuming mass in the the sgr system to be symmetrically divided about its center ( so that we only use southern hemisphere sgr stars with @xmath237 in our calculations ) we find that the tails , defined as those sgr stars lying outside the king profile ( section 4 , table 1 ) , contain about 15% the number of stars within the king profile .",
    "this estimate is derived from the counts for stars within the @xmath238 kpc slab in figure 13 .",
    "johnston , sigurdsson & hernquist ( 1999 ) have given a formalism for calculating the mass loss rate in a dwarf satellite based on a measured profile such as that shown in figures 5 and 13 .",
    "using their formula ( 18 ) , an orbital period of the sgr system of 0.7 gyr , and only the clearly visible tail from the king profile to @xmath239 , we obtain a mass loss rate for sgr that is 17% of the mass interior to the king limiting radius per gyr .",
    "a slightly different formulation by johnston , choi & guhathakurta ( 2002 ) yields a mass loss rate about 40% smaller .",
    "these order of magnitude estimates are consistent with the the above empirically determined m giant mass fraction in the sgr tails if those tails correspond to mass lost over the last about 1.5 - 2 orbits ; this is indeed the timescale suggested by matching tails reproduced by sgr disruption models ( e.g. , law et al .",
    "2003 ) .    as discussed above , because m giants only trace recently formed tidal debris they permit only estimates of a _ lower limit _ to the net stellar mass lost by sgr and the fractional contribution of sgr debris to the milky way halo .",
    "moreover , in this discussion we have ignored the issue of whether a sizeable fraction of the stars within the sgr king profile represent stars that have become unbound in the most recent perigalacticon passage along the lines of the scenario envisaged in section 4.3.3 .",
    "thus , the mass loss limit estimated above pertains primarily to stars detached prior to the recent perigalacticon .",
    "figure 16 shows the distribution of 2mass late type giants projected onto the galactic @xmath240 plane . in this orientation",
    ", we see the sgr orbital plane almost  edge - on \" as the vertical spike spanning both hemispheres , as in figure 7a .",
    "the panels illustrate the same color ranges as figure 14c - e , however , unlike the latter figures , in which the sample has been limited to stars in a 14 kpc wide slab centered on the sgr plane , figure 16 shows the entire 2mass sample , except for stars more reddened than @xmath241 .",
    "in addition , to avoid substantial noise from projection of the faint magnitude  contamination shells \" ( section 6.6 ) , it is necessary to remove all sources with estimated photometric parallaxes larger than 40 kpc , 50 kpc , and 60 kpc , respectively , in figures 16a , 16b and 16c .",
    "these distance limits effectively remove the bulk of the faint end contaminants ( see figure 15 ) , at the expense of slightly truncating the most distant parts of the northern loop .",
    "figure 16 illustrates that , apart from the magellanic clouds , which are the sources of the large  finger of god \" features in the lower right of each panel , unbound sgr debris appears to be the predominant source of late type giant stars in the milky way halo .    on the basis of the data in figure 16 and assessing only the northern galactic hemisphere to avoid the complication of the magellenic clouds , we estimate that sgr debris represents more than about 75% of the high halo ( @xmath242 kpc ) in the color ranges shown .",
    "the estimate rises to 80% or more if the high halo is defined by @xmath243 kpc .",
    "these estimates are based on assuming all stars within 5 kpc or so of the sgr plane are indeed sgr debris , and so will be overestimated to the degree that there are non - related halo stars in that volume ; however , based on the apparent mean density of stars away from that plane , this should be a minor effect ( except in the case of chance coincidence of other m giant substructure near the sgr plane ) .",
    "of course , these calculations do not ( 1 ) include sgr debris stars lopped off the top of the northern loop by the distance limits ( which would increase the fractional sgr contribution ) , ( 2 ) account for any residual contamination of the halo by false positives introduced by photometric errors , or ( 3 ) account for any possible increases in the number of m giants at larger radii than the limits shown , or at galactic latitudes lower that those analyzed .",
    "in addition , ( 4 ) our criterion for selecting m giants was guided specifically by the location of _ sgr_-type m giants in the nir two - color diagram , though age - metallicity effects in the relevant parts of the two - color diagram are minor for these types of stars . despite these minor uncertainties , that sgr debris is the major contributor of the high latitude halo m giant population to 60 kpc seems a reasonable conclusion .",
    "the dominance of sgr in creating the galactic halo m giant population is reflected in the great circle cell counts analysis discussed in section 5 . however , our results differ somewhat from those of ibata et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , whose analysis of the 2mass early release data led them to conclude that sgr debris represented only about 5% of the halo m giant population . though the two analyses use different selection criteria to isolate m giant stars , we are uncertain exactly why they arrive at such substantially different limits on the m giant contribution to the halo .",
    "it may be that galactic the exclusion of disk giants based on a galactic latitude limit , as done by ibata et al . , is not as restrictive as our @xmath244 criterion ; but a more likely contributor to the difference is our elimination of the excess background by the  contamination shell \" ( section 6.6 ) in both the cartesian as well as the gc3 analysis presented in section 5 .",
    "however , we are in agreement with ibata et al .",
    "( 2002a ) that , apart from the presumably bound population of red stars in the magellanic cloud represented by the finger of god spikes , it would appear that the clouds have _ not _ been a major contributor to the halo m giant population .",
    "these results pertain only to sgr contribution to the halo of the latest type giant stars , and say nothing about the net mass contributed to the halo , either in the form of dark matter or in stars of all spectral types . however , along these lines , we find interesting the result of vivas et al .",
    "( 2001 ; discussed further below ) , in which almost every one of the rr lyraes they find along the line of sight to the apogalacticon of the northern loop could conceivably be a part of sgr tidal debris , possibly including even the nearby rr lyraes , depending on the disposition of the sgr debris near the sun . in any case , that vivas et al .",
    "find a  hole \" in their rr lyrae counts precisely at the distance of the interior of the northern loop is dramatic and suggests that even for such old stars sgr may be a dominant contributor to at least the outer ( @xmath245 kpc ) halo .",
    "dinescu et al . ( 2002 ) have summarized the various searches for extended sgr debris to date ; their figure 4 gives a representation of the placement of various detections and non - detections on the celestial sphere , along with a great circle for the ibata et al .",

    "it is worth reviewing the previous detections of sgr debris in more detail here , and , in particular , taking into account the _ distances _ of the stars that constitute the various detections .",
    "a comparison with other surveys is especially useful ( 1 ) as a check on distance scales from the disparate tracers that have been used , ( 2 ) because we are now able to place almost all previous detections into a unified context , and ( 3 ) comparisons to surveys of other sgr tracers provide new insights into the sgr disruption and debris trails .",
    "figure 17 , which repeats the m giant distribution of figure 10 , provides our summary comparison of the detections by sgr longitude and distance .",
    "figure 17 includes only detections of extratidal sgr material , and excludes the numerous studies near the sgr center .",
    "perhaps the most striking visual impression of extended sgr ( and other potential ) tidal debris in the halo has been that afforded by the sloan digital sky survey . in several studies analyzing data from the first sloan observations in a strip along the celestial equator ,",
    "the presence of sgr s extended tidal arms have made themselves known ( e.g. , figure 18a ) .",

    "clearly radial velocity data are needed to determine whether any of the @xmath249 kpc m giants and rr lyrae may be related to sgr or other tidal debris interior to the solar circle ( e.g. , wrapped up leading arm material as described in johnston et al . 1999a and kundu et al .",
    "1999 ) , or whether they are all part of the galactic bulge , ipii / thick disk and/or inner halo .",
    "interior to their @xmath254 kpc clumps , both rr lyrae surveys also show a prominent  hole \" in their distribution that appears to correspond to the interior of the northern loop .",
    "this is an interesting result , because sgr disruption models ( e.g. , ibata et al . 2001b , law et al . 2003 ) predict that trailing arm debris , if extended beyond the length limit revealed by m giants here , should eventually reach and cross through the northern loop hole .",
    "indeed , the cluster ngc 5364 , which lies right in the middle of the northern loop hole ( see figure 17 ) , is consistent with the position and velocity of such extended , wrapped sgr trailing debris ( bellazzini et al .",
    "2002a , 2003 ) .",
    "if ngc 5634 is sgr debris , one might expect to see a population of sgr rr lyraes along with it .",
    "further work is needed to clarify this dilemma .    our analysis ( section 7.2 ) for the fractional contribution of sgr _ m giants _ to the halo pertains to a stellar species expected only for relatively metal rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath255 ) populations",
    " and it is not altogether too remarkable that the relatively minor fraction of halo stars that are that metal - rich could have come from a very small number of contributors like sgr .",
    "however , the overall distribution of _ rr lyrae stars _ in this part of the sky , including the contrast of near and far clumps and the intervening hole , appears to match closely the distribution of the m giants .",

    "a fifth cluster that lies in the heart of the southern arc ( figure 17 ) , pal 12 , has been shown to have orbital characteristics that make it a reasonably good candidate for association with sgr ( dinescu et al . 2000 ; see also martnez - delgado et al .",

    "2003 ) have shown , precise knowledge of the sgr orbit is of great use to sorting out interesting candidates , we defer an analysis of connections of the sgr debris streams and globular clusters to a companion contribution containing velocity data as well as our best fit model to the m giant data .",
    "in section 6.4 we discussed the proximity of the sgr northern arm to the solar neighborhood . in section 6.6",
    "we argued that the southern arm seemed to be at least @xmath308 long , sweeping into the northern hemisphere ; if so , then models of the sgr disruption ( e.g. , law et al .",
    "2003 ) show that the northern loop is long enough to cross the galactic plane on this side of the galactic center . in figures 14c and 14d",
    "we find evidence that the leading arm may even cross the _ trailing _ arm in the southern hemisphere .",
    "and in section 8 and figure 17 we showed apparently confirmatory evidence from other surveys that sgr debris is approaching the solar neighborhood from the ngc .",
    "how might the suggested local presence of debris from the sgr dwarf spheroidal have impacted previous studies of the galactic halo , many which have been conducted with halo stars relatively near the sun in potentially  sgr - contaminated \" regions of the galaxy ?",
    "the question turns on the relative density of leading sgr arm debris passing through / near the solar neighborhood .",
    "we can estimate the local density of sgr stars by extrapolating the m giant density just above the galactic plane and converting that density to other spectral types ( colors ) via an adopted luminosity function .",
    "this is most straightforward for evolved stars , where the luminosity function can be derived directly from 2mass observations of the sgr center  for example , the background - subtracted sgr color - magnitude diagram shown in figure 1c . to eliminate residual , unsubtracted contamination from non - sgr stars and isolate the sgr rgb we apply the following criterion :    @xmath309    this selection effectively separates the sgr rgb from the residual contributions of the galactic bulge population several magnitudes brighter ( see figure 1c ) .",
    "the resulting luminosity function so calculated is shown in figure 21a .",
    "the figure 1c color - magnitude diagram begins to  run out \" beyond @xmath310 .",
    "the _ color function _ for evolved stars corresponding to the luminosity function is shown in figure 21b . from the slope of the rgb",
    ", the @xmath310 magnitude limit means that the color function is complete only for rgb stars redder than @xmath311  roughly spectral types later than k3 .",
    "the ratios of stars of different spectral types can be computed by comparing counts by colors .",
    "bessell & brett ( 1988 ; see also bessell et al .",
    "1991 ) have given approximate colors for stars by spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "obviously metallicity effects are important , but for a rough calculation the corresponding 2mass color for the bessell & brett types is simplistically adopted .",
    "accordingly , the 2mass color of a type m0iii star is @xmath312 ( carpenter 2001 ) .",
    "table 4 presents the figure 1c counts for evolved sgr stars as determined by the color functions presented in figure 21b .",
    "roughly , for every sgr m giant we expect three stars of type k3iii through m0iii , and more than seven k giants of any type ( a substantially conservative lower limit due to the incompleteness of the early k type giant counts due to the magnitude limit of the figure 1 sample ) .",
    "we now extrapolate the m giant density in the sgr leading tidal arm to the solar neighborhood by counting the number of m giant stars ( @xmath313_o < 1.30 $ ] ) in a 5 kpc radius cylinder centered on the sun and whose axis is roughly perpendicular to the galactic plane._{sgr , gc } = [ -8.5,0]$ ] kpc and parallel to the @xmath314 axis in figure 11 . ] to avoid disk contamination and primarily sample the nearby sgr leading arm , only stars with @xmath315 kpc are tallied ; 70 are found , which results in an m giant density of about 0.042 kpc@xmath316 . under the assumption that all of these stars are leading arm sgr stars and using table 4",
    ", this implies a nearby sgr @xmath15k3 giant density of 0.17 kpc@xmath316 .",
    "because the m : k giant ratio decreases with age / metallicity , and , given the evidence for possible age / metallicity / giant color variations depicted in figure 14 , the above k giant density is a lower limit .",
    "this density is comparable to the density of a velocity clump of nine , mostly metal poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath317 ) red giants having hipparcos proper motions and radial velocities and located within 2.5 kpc of the sun discussed by helmi et al .",
    "these authors postulate that this clump , which has a velocity perpendicular to the plane consistent with that expected for nearby sgr debris ( roughly 225 km s@xmath71 downward ) , came from a progenitor system that  probably resembled the fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies \" and that may have contributed 12% of all metal - poor halo stars outside the solar circle ( a number that may be three times smaller according to a reanalysis by chiba & beers 2000 ) .",
    "these nine stars are distributed all over the sky with no obvious spatial structure within the 2.5 kpc radius volume , as might be expected for a large stream passing near the sun .",
    "together , the aforementioned properties of this clump of giant stars are enticingly consistent with sgr leading arm in the solar neighborhood ; however , the derived ( by both helmi et al . and",
    "chiba & beers ) @xmath318 angular momentum for this clump is apparently too large and the apogalacticon for its progenitor system too small compared to expectations for the nearly polar sgr orbit that would have produced the m giant tidal arms observed here .",
    "both inconsistencies depend to some extent on the adopted galactic rotation curve ( mass profile ) and local standard of rest velocity and should be re - addressed with a galactic model that self - consistently explains the sgr debris stream in all directions .",
    "the halo luminosity function is poorly constrained for giant stars .",
    "reid & majewski ( 1993 ; see their figure 5 ) have compiled numerous estimates of the halo luminosity function and derive a mean  globular cluster \" luminosity function to represent the halo",
    ". adopting this function for the local halo produces a density of @xmath15k3 halo giants ( assuming @xmath319 \\sim 0.0 $ ] ) of order 45 kpc@xmath316  a number that is about a factor of two higher than morrison s ( 1993 ) estimate ( taking into account the fainter absolute magnitude limit in her study ) and so perhaps represents an upper limit .",
    "to the extent that the true local halo giant density is thus described , one might therefore conclude that if the sgr leading arms is in the solar neighborhood it contributes only of order 0.4 - 0.8% of the _ local _ evolved halo stars , and would not likely have significantly impacted studies ( e.g. , yoss et al .",
    "1992 , morrison et al .",
    "1993 ) of nearby  halo giants \" .",
    "however , it may well have affected more distant halo giant samples , e.g. , that by ratnatunga & freeman ( 1989 ) of stars in the sgp field sa141 , a sample for which they noted a particularly small velocity dispersion and which contains stars of the approximate velocity expected for the trailing sgr tail in this general direction .",
    "assuming an effective vertical halo scaleheight of 3.5 kpc ( reid & majewski 1993 ) and the above local halo giant density , sgr dominates the halo k giant density by 5 - 6 scaleheights , or 17 - 20 kpc above the plane  distances comparable to those probed by the sa141 survey .    because of some uncertainty in the actual stellar densities of the local halo population(s ) , it is difficult to assess accurately the relative impact of sgr debris on studies of galactic structure .",
    "we may , however , more directly calculate the actual number of sgr stars contributing to a particular survey . here",
    "we focus on the magnitude limited survey of stars at the ngp by majewski ( 1992 ) , for which a relatively complete radial velocity and proper motion analysis of stars ( mainly f - k dwarfs ) to @xmath320 is described in majewski , munn & hawley ( 1994 , 1996 ) . to estimate the number of such stars that could have been contributed by sgr",
    ", we integrate the 15 gyr old ( the precise age adopted has little affect on the analysis ) theoretical luminosity function for a cluster with metal abundance @xmath321 by silvestri et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; this luminosity function was found to give a good match to observationally - derived rgb and main sequence luminosity functions for the globular cluster 47 tucanae by those authors .",
    "taking into account the volume completeness limits of the majewski ( 1992 ) survey as a function of ( @xmath322 ) , we integrate the silvestri et al .",
    "luminosity function from the main sequence turn off at @xmath323 to @xmath324 and scale this number by the ratio of the sgr @xmath15kiii giant density above to the integral of the luminosity function for @xmath325 ( assumed to represent the luminosity of kiii giants ) .",
    "the result leads to an estimate that some 5 - 10 sgr dwarfs should be present in the subsample of majewski ( 1992 ) dwarfs discussed by majewski , munn & hawley ( 1996 ) .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , that the halo sample in that survey is constituted by three phase space clumps with of order this number of stars each , and two of the clumps ( and the net average of all halo stars in the survey ) show a net negative radial velocity , as expected for sgr debris at the north galactic pole .",
    "a more detailed assessment of the particular energy and momentum distribution of those phase space clumps in the context of sgr models that accommodate nearby debris flow is warranted , but clearly the several recent findings of excess numbers of stars with a downward motion from the ngp - for example , from the majewski et al .",

    "( 1994 , 1996 ) studies of horizontal branch stars  offer tantalizing possibilities of earlier detections of the leading sgr arm near the sun .",

    "the present discussion provides the first relatively reddening - free description and analysis of the central regions of the dwarf , as well as extensive new information on the extended tail structure of tidally stripped stars .",
    "the latter is particularly useful for placing all previous studies of the sgr system into a well - defined context , and places the most stringent constraints yet on models of the disruption of sgr in the galactic potential .",
    "we have concentrated on an empirical description of the sgr system and resisted extensive interpretation via disruption model - fitting here because : ( 1 ) the degree to which a simple _ empirical _ description of the 2mass results nonetheless advances our understanding of the sgr system is manifest .",
    "( 2 ) published model fitting to previously extant data ( especially the works by helmi & white 2001 , ibata et al .",
    "2001 and ibata & lewis 1998 to which we have frequently referred ) provide a sufficiently accurate match to the spatial distributions described here that a general sense of the sgr orbit and destruction are in hand , while further refinements will benefit from the addition of kinematics ( see law et al .",
    "( 3 ) a survey to obtain the velocities of stars in the extended sgr tidal arms is underway , and first results for hundreds of m giants will be included in future contributions .",
    "a sgr system accurately characterized both spatially and kinematically will become a powerful fiducial against which to delineate the structure and dynamics of the milky way and its halo .      1 .",
    "2mass provides a facile means by which to explore the sgr dwarf galaxy and its tidal tail system , because that system contains a prominent population of m giant stars ( figure 1 ) and such stars are readily identifiable using @xmath326 infrared photometry ( figure 2 ; section 2 ) .",
    "2 .   when an m giant selection is applied to aperture photometry from the magnitude error - limited 2mass point source catalogue , the center of the sgr dwarf and both its leading and trailing tidal tails are among the most prominent , high latitude features observed in the sky ( e.g. , figure 3 ; section3 ) .",
    "3 .   the central parts of the sgr system , as traced by 2mass m giants , exhibit a smooth distribution resembling a dwarf spheroidal galaxy , though one of high ellitpicity ( @xmath327 ) and large extent ( figure 4 , section 4 ) . as with other dsph galaxies",
    ", radial profile fits to the center of sgr ( with the ends of the semi - major axis excised to minimize the contribution from the tidal tails ) can be described by a king profile , albeit one of very large core ( 224 arcmin ) and limiting ( 30 degrees ) semi - major radii ( figure 5 ; table 1 ; section 4.1 ) .",
    "a power - law + core ( plc ) fit to the radial profile is also provided , though like the king function fit , this functional form can not provide a good match to the radial profile transition to the tidal tails . however , by comparison to the extragalactic population of dwarf ellipticals , the extreme ellipticity of these fits in the direction of the tidal streams suggests the significant presence of the tidally stripped population and suggests that these functional fits do not represent the gravitationally bound dwarf .",
    "two departures of the observed radial profile ( figure 5 ) from the king ( and plc ) fits are the presence of a central cusp ( section 4.2.1 ) and a break to the tidal tails ( section 4.2.2 ) .",
    "the approximately half - degree radius central cusp is coincident with the location of the globular cluster m54 , however , because that cluster is typically characterized as an old , metal - poor system , it can not be contributing m giants to the central excess of these stars above the flat part of the king profile .",
    "the connection between m54 and the concentration of stellar populations of a variety of ages at its location ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ) is still unclear , although one hypothesis ( section 4.3.3 ) is that the nucleated center of sgr may correspond to the residual bound core of a dramatically disrupting sgr system .",
    "the outer break in the sgr radial profile to a @xmath328 declining population resembles breaks seen in the outer parts of the radial profiles of other dsph galaxies and which have been interpreted as possible extratidal debris ; in the case of the sgr system this is now established definitely to be the case .",
    "the integrated brightness of sgr is found to be @xmath329 , with the cusp adding a few more hundredths of a magnitude of light .",
    "if the distance modulus to sgr is taken as 16.9 , we find that the center of the sgr system edges out fornax as the brightest of the dsph galaxies , with an absolute magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "these results appear to be consistent with the similarity of the fornax globular cluster specific frequency to that of the sgr progenitor ( section 4.3.2 ) .",
    "when the observed king parameters of the radial profile and the sgr central velocity dispersion are combined in the usual king ( 1966 ) methodology we estimate the mass of sgr to be @xmath330 m@xmath66 and obtain a total @xmath331 m@xmath66/l@xmath66 ( section 4.3.2 ) .",
    "however , since even this mass is substantially below that needed for a system to withstand the galactic tidal force over scales of the observed king limiting radius , we argue ( section 4.3.3 ) that the true mass , tidal radius and bound fraction of the observed central sgr system must be substantially smaller than suggested by the king profile , and that sgr is presently undergoing a major mass loss event  perhaps almost complete disruption  induced by tidal shocking from the last perigalacticon passage . a much smaller radius for the bound sgr core would help to resolve the timing problem (  m giant conundrum \" ) posed by the presence of relatively recently formed stars ( m giants ) spread along tidal tails of comparable age ( section 4.3.4 ) . 7 .",
    "the tidal tails of the sgr system span both galactic hemispheres ( sections 6.1 - 6.3 ; figures 3 and 8 - 11 ) , but show relatively little evidence for precession ( figures 6 , 7 and 13 ) . given the 13@xmath0 tilt of the sgr orbital plane ,",
    "an almost spherical halo potential is implied ( section 5.2.2 ) . in section 5.2",
    "we provide fits to the debris ( orbital ) plane and define sgr coordinate systems based on that plane that are useful for interpreting the sgr tidal system .",
    "the trailing arm is followed for at least @xmath332 from the sgr center to the galactic anticenter , and perhaps farther , into the north galactic hemisphere ( section 6.2 ; figures 8 - 11 ) . for a large fraction of this extent ,",
    "the density of the trailing debris and its distance from the sun are more or less constant .",
    "the leading arm makes a northern loop with mean apogalacticon @xmath184 kpc ( section 6.3 ; figures 8 - 11 ) and a path that takes it to the north galactic cap , from where it arcs back down toward the galactic disk .",
    "we find ourselves at an unusual time in galactic history : for less than 2% of the sun s orbit around the galaxy are we as close to the path of the leading arm debris as we are now . if the leading arm is long enough to reach the galactic plane on this side of the milky way we should expect to find sgr stars in or near the solar neighborhood ( sections 6.4 ) .",
    "the implications of this possibility for studies of the galactic structure near the sun are discussed in section 9 ; while the density of sgr stars would be swamped by those of other stellar populations locally , sgr would dominate the halo tens of kiloparsecs above the disk .",
    "several previous surveys of halo stars might contain sgr representation .",
    "analysis of all m giants in our sample indeed reveal sgr to be the prominent contributor of such stars to the high halo ( section 5.1 , 7.2 ; figures 6 , 16 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for carbon stars ( section 8.3 ; figure 20 ) .",
    "no evidence for extended m giant tidal tails from the magellanic clouds are seen ( section 5.3 ) .",
    "the relatively constant density of the sgr trailing arm over a great part of its extent ( figures 12 , 13 ) implies a relatively constant mass loss rate over the last several sgr orbits , excluding the possible last major disruption event ( section 6.5 ) .",
    "some evidence for stellar population variations along the arms is suggested by the changing color of m giants with position ( section 6.6 ) .",
    "it is likely that older tracer stars will map the arms to even greater length than is possible with m giants .",
    "the number of stars in the tidal arms is at least 15% that within the king limiting radius ( section 7.1 ) .",
    "good correspondence is found between the location and distances of m giant tidal debris and nearly all previous identifications of sgr debris ( section 8 ; figures 17 , 18 ) .",
    "however , sgr carbon stars are found to be subluminous compared to carbon stars in other galactic satellites ( section 8.3 ; figure 19 ) , requiring adjustment of the previous sgr carbon star distance scale .",

    "<S> we present the first all - sky view of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy mapped by m giant star tracers detected in the complete two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> near infrared photometry of sgr s prominent m giant population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of sgr . </S>",
    "<S> the main body is fit with a king profile of limiting major axis radius 30@xmath0  substantially larger than previously found or assumed  beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from stars in its tidal tails ; thus the sgr radial profile resembles that of galactic dsph satellites . adopting traditional methods for analyzing dsph light profiles </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the brightness of the main body of sgr to be @xmath1 ( the brightest of the known galactic dsph galaxies ) and the total sgr mass - to - light ratio to be 25 in solar units . </S>",
    "<S> however , we regard the latter result with suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the king fit core radius ( 224 arcmin ) may be outside the actual sgr tidal radius as the former dwarf spiral / irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic disruption over its past last orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the m giant distribution of sgr exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as , but not due to , the old stars constituting the globular cluster m54 .    </S>",
    "<S> a striking trailing tidal tail is found to extend from the sgr center and arc across the south galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean distance varying from @xmath2 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent leading debris arm extends from the sgr center northward of the galactic plane to an apogalacticon @xmath3 kpc from the sun , then turns towards the north galactic cap ( ngc ) from where it descends back towards the galactic plane , becomes foreshortened and at brighter magnitudes covers the ngc . </S>",
    "<S> the leading and trailing sgr tails lie along a well - defined orbital plane about the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the sun lies within a kiloparsec of that plane and near the path of leading sgr debris ; thus , it is possible that former sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of this new view of the sgr galaxy and its entrails for the character of the sgr orbit , mass , mass - loss rate , and contribution of stars to the milky way halo . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal precession displayed by the sgr tidal debris along its inclinded orbit supports the notion of a nearly spherical galactic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the number of m giants in the sgr tails is at least 15% that contained within the king limiting radius of the main sgr body . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that m giants , presumably formed within the past few gigayears in the sgr nucleus , are nevertheless so widespread along the sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of these arms but poses a timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the sgr core and that is most naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> sgr appears to contribute more than 75% of the high latitude , halo m giants , despite substantial reservoirs of m giants in the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> no evidence of extended m giant tidal debris from the magellanic clouds is found .    </S>",
    "<S> generally good correspondence is found between the m giant , all - sky map of the sgr system and all previously published detections of potential sgr debris , with the exception of sgr carbon stars  which must be subluminous compared with counterparts in other galactic satellites in order to resolve the discrepancy . </S>"
