    "this paper is concerned with the development of a multiscale modeling approach for advanced materials such as high - purity single crystals .",
    "the present approach is aligned with the current _ divide and conquer _ paradigm in micromechanics ( see , e.  g. , @xcite .",
    "this paradigm first identifies and models the controlling unit process at microscopic scale .",
    "then , the energetics and dynamics of these mechanisms are quantified by means of atomistic modeling .",
    "finally , the macroscopic driving force is correlated to macroscopic response via microscopic modeling .",
    "this last step involves two stages , _ localization _ of the macroscopic driving force into unit - process driving forces and _ averaging _ of the contribution of each unit process into the macroscopic response .",
    "we show in this article that the meticulous application of this paradigm renders truly predictive models of the mechanical behavior of complex systems .",
    "in particular we predict the hardening of ta single crystal and its dependency for a wide range of temperatures and strain rates .",
    "the feat of this approach is that predictions from these atomistically informed models recover most of the macroscopic characteristic features of the available experimental data , without a priori knowledge of such experimental tests .",
    "this approach then provides a procedure to forecast the mechanical behavior of material in extreme conditions where experimental data is simply not available or very difficult to collect .",
    "a crucial step in this approach is the appropriate selection and modeling of the unit processes .",
    "these models supply the link between the atomic and meso scale by identifying and correlating the relevant material properties , susceptible of atomistic determination such as energy formation for defects , with the corresponding driving forces . in this case , we specifically consider the following unit processes : double - kink formation and thermally activated motion of kinks ; the close - range interactions between primary and forest dislocation , leading to the formation of jogs ; the percolation motion of dislocations through a random array of forest dislocations introducing short - range obstacles of different strengths ; dislocation multiplication due to breeding by double cross - slip ; and dislocation pair - annihilation .    a set of material parameters is then obtained from the modeling and identification stage , which is required to quantify the contribution of each of the unit processes .",
    "we compute these materials properties using a combination of ab - initio quantum mechanics ( qm ) and force field ( ff ) calculations .",
    "qm describes the atomic interactions from first principles , i.e. with no input from experiments ; unfortunatelly qm methods are computationally intensive and restricted to small systems , making qm calculations impractical to study most of the materials properties governing plasticity .",
    "force fields give the total energy of a system as a potential energy function of the atomic positions and with molecular dynamics ( md ) allows the simulation of systems containing millions of atoms .",
    "we used ab - initio quantum mechanical calculations ( equations of state of various crystalline phases , elastic constants , energetics of defects , etc . ) to develop a many body force field ( ff ) ( named qeam ff ) for tantalum .",
    "we use the qeam ff with md to calculate the core energy of the @xmath0 screw dislocation , that of the edge dislocation with burgers vector @xmath1 in ( 110 ) planes .",
    "we have also calculated the formation energies and nucleation lengths of the kinks in @xmath1 screw dislocations .",
    "the organization of the paper follows the sequential stages of the proposed approach .",
    "first , we provide a brief description of each of the unit processes including the governing final equations .",
    "we then identify and compute by atomistic means the corresponding material properties .",
    "finally , we compare the predictions against experimental data .",
    "plastic deformation in metallic systems is the macroscopic manifestation of dislocation activity .",
    "the resistance to the dislocation motion , therefore , engenders the hardening properties observed in this type of materials .",
    "it is then the complex interplay of microscopic mechanisms controlling * dislocation mobility , dislocation interaction and dislocation evolution * which confers the macroscopic constitutive properties . in the present approach ,",
    "these controlling processes are considered to be _ orthogonal _ in the sense that are weakly coupled with each other .",
    "the interaction among them is only established through the uniqueness of the macroscopic driving force which are shared , via the localization process , by all the unit processes .    in this section",
    ", we introduce the set of controlling unit processes which have been identified for describing the mechanical response of high - purity bcc single crystals , in particular for tantalum .",
    "we also provide the final expression resulting from the the modeling of each of these processes .",
    "a detailed description of the model , including comparison with experimental data is given in @xcite .",
    "we consider the thermally activated motion of dislocations within an _ obstacle - free _ slip plane . under these conditions ,",
    "the motion of the dislocations is driven by an applied resolved shear stress @xmath2 and is hindered by the lattice resistance , which is weak enough that it may be overcome by thermal activation .",
    "the lattice resistance is presumed to be well - described by a peierls energy function , which assigns an energy per unit length to dislocation segments as a function of their position on the slip plane .    in crystals",
    ", the core of screw dislocation segments relaxes into low - energy non - planar configurations @xcite .",
    "this introduces deep valleys into the peierls energy function aligned with the burgers vector directions and possessing the periodicity of the lattice . at low temperatures ,",
    "the dislocations tend to adopt low - energy configurations and , consequently , the dislocation population predominantly consists of long screw segments . in order to move a screw segment normal to itself , the dislocation core must first be constricted , which requires a substantial supply of energy .",
    "thus , the energy barrier for the motion of screw segments , and the attendant peierls stress , may be expected to be large , and the energy barrier for the motion of edge segments to be comparatively smaller .",
    "for instance , duesbery and xu @xcite have calculated the peierls stress for a rigid screw dislocation in mo to be 0.022@xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 shear modulus , whereas the corresponding peierls stress for a rigid edge dislocation is 0.006@xmath3 , or about one fourth of the screw value .",
    "this suggests that the rate - limiting mechanism for dislocation motion is the thermally activated motion of kinks along screw segments ( @xcite ) .",
    "-0.1    at sufficiently high temperatures and under the application of a resolved shear stress @xmath5 , a double - kink may be nucleated with the assistance of thermal activation ( e.  g. , @xcite , and the subsequent motion of the kinks causes the screw segment to effectively move forward , fig .",
    "[ fig : kinkpair ] . under this conditions",
    "the following expression for the effective temperature and strain - rate dependent peierls @xmath6 is obtained : @xmath7 where the effective peierls stress is given by @xmath8 and the reference strain is defined as @xmath9 in the preceeding equations , @xmath10 is the burgers vector , @xmath11 is the dislocation density , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath14 is the absolute temperature , and @xmath15 is the attempt frequency which may be identified with the debye frequency to a first approximation . also , @xmath16 is the distance between two consecutive peierls valleys . for crystals , @xmath17 if the slip plane is @xmath18 , @xmath19 , if the slip plane is @xmath20 , and @xmath21 if the slip plane is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cubic lattice size @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath24 is the energy of formation of a kink - pair and @xmath25 is the length of an incipient double kink .",
    "the formation energy @xmath26 and the length @xmath27 , which can not be reliably estimated from elasticity since the energy is composed mostly of core region , can , however , be accurately computed by recourse to atomistic models as shown in section  [ atomistic ] .",
    "modeling of this first unit process renders the first 2 material properties amenable of atomistic calculations .    -0.1",
    "-0.1    in figure [ fig : thermal ] the dependence of the effective peierls stress on temperature and rate of deformation is illustrated .",
    "the peierls stress decreases ostensibly linearly up to a critical temperature @xmath28 , beyond which it tends to zero .",
    "these trends are in agreement with the experimental observations of wasserbch @xcite and lachenmann and schultz @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath28 increases with the strain rate .",
    "in particular , in this model the effect of increasing ( decreasing ) the strain rate has an analogous effect to decreasing ( increasing ) the temperature , and vice - versa , as noted by tang _",
    "_ @xcite . in the regime of very high strain - rates ( @xmath29 )",
    ", effects such as electron and phonon drag become important and control the velocity of dislocations @xcite .      in the forest - dislocation theory of hardening ,",
    "the motion of dislocations , which are the agents of plastic deformation in crystals , is impeded by secondary or ` forest' dislocations crossing the slip plane .",
    "as the moving and forest dislocations intersect , they form jogs or junctions of varying strengths @xcite which , provided the junction is sufficiently short , may be idealized as point obstacles . moving dislocations",
    "are pinned down by the forest dislocations and require a certain elevation of the applied resolved shear stress in order to bow out and bypass the pinning obstacles . for the case of infinitely strong obstacles ,",
    "the resistance of the forest is provided by the strength of the obstacle pairs .",
    "this obstacle pair strength is subsequently reduced by considering that point obstacles composing the pair can only provide a finite strength .",
    "the processes imparting the pair - obstacle strength and obstacle strength are described next    -0.1    -0.1      we begin by treating the case of infinitely strong obstacles . in this case",
    ", pairs of obstacles pin down dislocation segments , which require a certain threshold resolved shear stress @xmath30 in order to overcome the obstacle pair .",

    "the interaction between primary and secondary dislocations may result in a variety of reaction products , including jogs and junctions @xcite .",

    "-0.2    we estimate the jog formation energy as follows . based on energy and mobility considerations",
    "already discussed , we may expect the preponderance of forest dislocations to be of screw character , and the mobile dislocation segments to be predominantly of edge character .",
    "we therefore restrict our analysis to intersections between screw and edge segments .",

    "( [ fig : junction2 ] ) .",
    "these values , which have been estimated to be of the order of few @xmath10 in the present case , can also be obtained by atomistic models .",
    "the density of forest obstacles depends directly on the dislocation densities in all slip systems of the crystal . therefore , in order to close the model we require a equation of evolution for the dislocation densities .",
    "processes resulting in changes in dislocation density include production by fixed sources , such as frank - read sources , breeding by double cross slip and pair annihilation ( see @xcite for a review ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the operation of fixed frank - read sources is quickly eclipsed by production due to cross slip at finite temperatures , it is an important mechanisms at low temperatures . the double cross - slip , fixed frank - read sources and pair annihilation mechanisms are next considered in turn .",
    "the rate of dislocation multiplication in a given slip system @xmath48 produced by fixed frank - reed sources and by breeding by cross glide is written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a constant associated with the fixed frank - read production ; this parameter is rather topological than material dependent .",
    "the rate of dislocation attrition due to pair annihilation may finally be estimated as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the effective annihilation distance .",
    "this is the maximum distance at which two screw segments with opposite direction and forced to move with a velocity @xmath59 will annihilate .",
    "this distance can be estimated by simply equating the time required for trapping and escaping .",
    "trapping is governed by the elastic interaction forces ( attraction ) while escaping by the applied strain rate .",
    "then , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a factor depending on the strain rate and temperature , @xmath62 is a reference slip - strain rate and @xmath63 is the cut - off value corresponding the effective screening distance .",
    "it follows that the critical pair - annihilation distance @xmath58 decreases with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature .",
    "thus , at high strain rates the dislocation velocities are high and the probability of being captured by another dislocation diminishes accordingly .",
    "additionally , an increase in temperature increases the dislocation mobility and speeds up the annihilation process , which results in an attendant increase in annihilation rates . the rate of annihilation is then modulated by the nucleation energy of a jog @xmath64 which can be calculated from atomistic simulations .",
    "in the previous section we have identified the following set of _ material parameters _ required to estimate the contribution of each of the controlling unit processes : @xmath65 , @xmath25 , @xmath66 @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in this section",
    "we briefly describe the computation of them using a first principles - based force field with molecular dynamics .",
    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) describes the atomic interactions from first principles , i.e. using no empirical input . unfortunately qm methods are computationaly intensive and thus only applicable to small systems ( hundreds of atoms ) and short times ( picoseconds ) .",
    "the study of most of the unit processes that govern the plasticity of materials ( such as dislocation mobility , kink energies , etc . )",
    "involve many atoms and long simulation times .",
    "such problems require the use of force fields , where the total energy of the system is given by a potential energy function of the atomic positions and does not involve the solution of shrodinger s equation .",
    "the drawback of using potentials to describe the atomic interactions is that some accuracy is lost ; it is thus of great importance to use accurate force fields to describe the atomic interactions .",
    "we developed a many body force field for tantalum based on accurate qm calculations @xcite which can be used with molecular dynamics ( md ) to simulate systems containing millions of atoms .",
    "we fitted an embedded atom model type force field ( named qeam ff ) to a variety of ab initio calculations , including the zero temperature equation of state ( eos ) for bcc , fcc , and a15 phases of ta in a wide pressure range , elastic constants , vacancy formation energy and energetics of a shear transformation in the twinning direction @xcite .",
    "ta is a bcc metal and no phase transition to other crustalline phase is known , but using qm we can calculate the eos of thermodynamicaly unstable or metastable phases ( such as a15 , fcc , hcp , etc . ) .",
    "including data about these high energy phases , with different coordination numbers , in the force field training set is important to correctly describe the atomic interactions near defects such as dislocations , grain boundaries , etc .",

    "two of the dislocations have burgers vector b=1/2a@xmath70 and the other two have b=-1/2a@xmath71 . such an arrangement of dislocations minimizes the misfit of atoms on the periodic boundary due to the effects of periodic images .",
    "we build the dislocations using the atomic displacements obtained from elasticity theory and then we relax the atomic coordinates using the qeam ff . in the bcc structure , there are two kinds of dislocation core configurations ( easy core and hard core ) that can be transformed to each other by reversing the burgers vector @xcite . in this work we focus on the lower energy easy cores . in figure [ ddmap_screw ]",

    "the arrows represent the relative displacement in [ 111 ] direction of neighboring atoms due to the dislocation .",
    "we can see from figure [ ddmap_screw ] that the equilibrium dislocation core obtained using qeam ff has three - fold symmetry and spreads out in three @xmath72 directions on 110 planes .",
    "lets define strain energy as the total energy of our system once the perfect crystal energy is subtracted .",
    "the total strain energy can be divided in two terms : core energy ( @xmath73 ) and elastic energy ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the latter contains the self - energy of each dislocation and their interactions and can be calculated using linear elasticity theory .",
    "the core energy is the energy contained close to the dislocation line ( closer than some distance @xmath75 called core radius ) where , due to the large strain , elasticity theory is not valid and the details of the interatomic interactions are important . for our quadrupole system",

    "we show the minimized energy as a function of @xmath82 for the different simulation cells ; in order to compare with previous calculations @xcite we took @xmath83 .",
    "we can see that the total energies follow a straight line as predicted by elasticity theory ( eq . [ elast_ene ] ) , showing that the value chosen for the core radius is large enough to take account for the non elastic region near the dislocation line . from a linear fit to our data we determine the core energy @xmath84 ev / b and @xmath85 .",
    "the value of k can also be computed from the elastic constants giving @xmath86 in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the fit .",
    "recent ab initio calculations of core energy ( using periodic cells containing 90 atoms ) give 0.86 ev / b , lower than the value obtained with qeam ff and the dislocation cores are compact and symmetric @xcite .    using the qeam we can calculate the strain energy associated with each atom . in figure ( [ ene_dist_screw ] )",
    "we show the atomic energy distribution ( number of atoms per dislocation per burgers vector as a function of their strain energy ) for a system containing 5670 atoms in the periodic cell .",
    "we can see that there are 6 atoms with atomic strain energy higher than 0.15 ev and another 6 atoms with energy in the range 0.06 - 0.08 ev .",

    "material parameters is remarkable , and the macroscopic predicted response retains most of the experimental features .",
    "these facts provide confidence in the multiscale modeling approach , indicating that even in the case that experimental data would not have been available , still the macroscopic behavior could have been predicted based only on atomistic calculations .",
    "the experiment data correspond to uniaxial tests on ta single crystals of mitchell and spitzig @xcite . in these tests ,",
    "99.97%-pure ta specimens were loaded in tension along the @xmath117 $ ] crystallographic axis , at various combinations of temperature and strain rate . in particular",
    "we considered temperatures ranging from @xmath118 to @xmath119 , and strain rates ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "the numerical procedure employed for the integration of the constitutive equations has been described elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the table lists the parameter values obtained by these methods , as described in the previous sections , in parallel with the values obtained by the fitting approach .",
    "thus , in the second set of properties which was used for numerical simulations , atomistic - based values replace fit - based values , when available .",

    "one can compare , from top to bottom : the experimental results , the results obtained after fitting the parameters , and the results obtained with atomistic - based parameters .",
    "it is evident from these figures that the model , with both sets of parameters , captures salient features of the behavior of ta crystals such as : the dependence of the initial yield point on temperature and strain rate ; the presence of a marked stage i of easy glide , specially at low temperature and high strain rates ; the sharp onset of stage ii hardening and its tendency to shift towards lower strains , and eventually disappear , as the temperature increases or the strain rate increases ; the parabolic stage ii hardening at low strain rates or high temperatures ; the stage ii softening at high strain rates or low temperatures ; the trend towards saturation at high strains ; and the temperature and strain - rate dependence of the saturation stress .",
    "thus , the predictive approach based on atomistic methods clearly shows its capacity to produce results matching the experimental evidence .",
    "the theory reveals useful insights into the mechanisms underlying these behaviors .",
    "for instance , since during state i the crystal deforms in single slip and the secondary dislocation densities are low , the peierls resistance dominates and the temperature and strain - rate dependency of yield owes mainly to the thermally activated formation of kinks and crossing of forest dislocations .",
    "it is interesting to note that during this stage the effect of increasing ( decreasing ) temperature is similar to the effect of decreasing ( increasing ) strain rate , as noted by tang _",
    "the onset of stage ii is due to the activation of secondary systems .",
    "the rate at which these secondary systems harden during stage i depends on the rate of dislocation multiplication in the primary system .",
    "this rate is in turn sensitive to the saturation strain @xmath147 , which increases with strain rate and decreases with temperature . as a result ,",
    "the length of the stage i of hardening is predicted to increase with strain rate and decrease with temperature , as observed experimentally .",
    "finally , the saturation stress is mainly governed by the forest hardening mechanism and , in particular , by the strength of the forest obstacles .",
    "this process is less thermally activated than the peierls stress , since the corresponding energy barriers are comparatively higher .",
    "consequently , the stress - strain curves tend to converge in this regime , in keeping with observation .",
    "the apparent softening observed in simulation results at the lowest temperature ( @xmath148 ) and the highest strain rate ( @xmath149 ) is actually an effect of the boundary conditions , allowing some level of rotation of the specimen . since in those cases ,",
    "the material hardening is relatively low ( stage i only ) , this geometrical softening dominates in the apparent macroscopic behavior . in the other cases , the activation of several systems at high strains results in a more isotropic deformation , in turn leading to limited rotations . in order to take the exact experimental boundary conditions into account , a finite element model of the whole specimen",
    "should be used , allowing for a non - homogeneous deformation field .",
