    "while the standard model ( sm ) has provided a compelling picture of low energy interactions , it has been plagued by theoretical inconsistencies .",
    "more recently , experimental deviations from the predictions of the model ( such as signals of neutrino masses and mixing @xcite ) have given further justification to building model of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "additionally , the experimental outlook on testing these scenarios looks very promising .",
    "lhc data is expected to provide ample material for analysis .",
    "when the data becomes available , it would be difficult to disentangle expectations for different models .",
    "the task of theorists is to provide viable scenarios for physics beyond the standard model _ and _ to predict the signals which distinguish them from the sm and from each other .",
    "a large variety of models is available , all of which attempt to resolve some theoretical inconsistency of the sm . of these",
    ", a particularly simple model is the left right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite .",
    "originally introduced to resolve the parity and neutrino mass problems , it remains one of the simplest extensions of the sm , and it is a natural scenario for the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the lrsm and its signals at accelerators have been thoroughly analyzed by theorists @xcite , and experimentalists have been particularly keen to search for doubly charged higgs bosons , predicted in most versions of the model @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid to the vector boson sector .",
    "the lrsm extends the gauge group of the sm to @xmath2 , and thus predicts the existence of two extra gauge bosons : a neutral @xmath3 and a charged @xmath0 .",
    "while an extra neutral gauge boson @xmath4 is predicted by several extensions of the sm , all containing an extra gauged @xmath5 symmetry group , a charged gauge boson would be a more likely indication of left right symmetry is present in several gauge unification scenarios , models with extra @xmath6 bosons also exist . ] .",
    "several other models predict the existence of extra @xmath7 bosons , such as extra dimensional models ( both randall sundrum @xcite and universal extra dimensions model @xcite ) , little higgs models @xcite and composite higgs models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 predicted in these models have features which distinguish them from lrsm , which we will discuss after our analysis .",
    "production of extra charged vector bosons at colliders has received less interest than that of @xmath8 , although one study exists for the tevatron @xcite . however , recently , papers have appeared which analyze chiral couplings of a @xmath7 at lhc and indicate how to disentangle left or right handed bosons @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we follow a different procedure . assuming the extra charged vector boson to come from a version of lrsm ( and",
    "thus be right - handed ) , we analyze the production mechanism , decay rates and possible signals at the lhc .",
    "@xmath0 bosons are predicted to be heavy , of @xmath9(tev ) and thus the signal expected to be much below the @xmath6 production signal .",
    "but this is only the case if the quark mixing matrix in the right - handed sector ( @xmath10 ) is either identical , or equal up to a diagonal matrix , to the one in the left - handed sector ( the usual cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa @xmath11)the so called _ manifest _ and _ pseudo - manifest _ lrsm , respectively .",
    "we describe the distinctive features of these models in the next section .",
    "this does not have to be the case , as was discussed at length by langacker and sankar @xcite , who allow right handed mixing matrices @xmath10 with large off - diagonal elements .",
    "they perform a thorough investigation of the constraints on the mass of @xmath0 and its mixing with @xmath6 under these circumstances , and find out that the @xmath0 mass can be a lot lighter , @xmath12 gev @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we refer to this model and its variants as the asymmetric left - right model .    in the age of lhc , there is another immediate advantage of the asymmetric left - right model : such a @xmath0 boson can be produced at rates larger by orders of magnitude than for models in which @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a diagonal phase matrix .",
    "one could see this by looking at the signal @xmath15 .",
    "this single - top production cross section is known to be important in identifying and distinguishing between different new physics models , as these can have different effects ( @xmath16-channel or @xmath17-channel ) on the production process @xcite .",
    "the partonic cross section at lhc is dominated by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "however for @xmath6 production one must rely on the process @xmath20 , and thus be disadvantaged by the small amount of @xmath21 quarks in the proton ; or rely on @xmath22 , which is suppressed by the @xmath23 or @xmath24 element of the @xmath11 .",
    "however , if the off - diagonal @xmath25 or @xmath26 elements of the @xmath10 are large , one could produce @xmath0 copiously .",
    "additionally if there are less stringent restrictions on the @xmath0 mass , one can envisage that @xmath0 production could be observable , and if so , a clear distinguishing signal for lrsm . at the tevatron ,",
    "the production cross section is dominated at the partonic level by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 . even for a light @xmath0 boson",
    ", we would not expect any enhancements due to non - diagonal entries in the @xmath10 , and the same is true for linear colliders .",
    "the sensitivity of the tevatron to @xmath0 searches has been thoroughly discussed in @xcite .",
    "mass limits from the existing data depend on the ratio of the coupling constants for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , on the nature and mass of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath32 , on the leptonic branching ratio for @xmath0 , on the form of the right - handed ckm matrix @xmath33",

    "it is clear that for all the parametrizations , the @xmath0 signal can be observed as a resonance in the @xmath35 invariant mass distribution at the lhc and is quite distinguishable from the sm background .",

    "the numerical values of these parameters are chosen according to the constraints from low energy phenomenology in figure 3 . in the last row we showed the signal of a lighter @xmath0 ( @xmath167 gev ) with binsize= 10 gev and equal gauge coupling constants ( @xmath182 ) in the region allowed by the constraints . by comparison , in figure 8",

    "this explains the resemblance of the signals between @xmath169 and the mlrsm . to distinguish among the left - right models and",
    "to finely pinpoint the origin of the signal requires further detailed analysis with more realistic detector simulations .",
    "we analyzed the single production , decay and collider signals of @xmath0 bosons produced in left - right symmetric models .",
    "we considered models with a general right - handed quark mixing structure ( which we call the asymmetric left - right model ) , but constrained by the kaon and b - meson flavor physics .",
    "we also compared the results with those of the manifest left - right symmetric model , where @xmath185 and the coupling constants in the left and right sectors are equal . in",
    "the asymmetric left right model , there is only one free parameter in the right - handed ckm mixing matrix .",
    "additionally , the charged higgs and @xmath0 masses , as well as the ratio of the @xmath30 and @xmath29 coupling constants , are also free parameters .",
    "we included restrictions on the same parameter space coming from @xmath186 mixing and the branching ratio for @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the dominant production mode is in association with a top quark , and this has a large background from the single top production ( in association with @xmath6 ) from the standard model .",
    "however looking at events in the 500 - 2000 gev mass range for @xmath0 , we show that the sm background is always below the @xmath0 background , and we expect a significant peak above the sm background around the @xmath0 mass ( assumed to be in the range considered ) .",
    "even with a luminosity of @xmath187 fb@xmath184 , achievable at the lhc within the next 3 years , we expect several events a year , while with @xmath188 fb@xmath184 , the events could reach 100 per year .",
    "we concentrate our analysis in the @xmath189 decay mode , where @xmath183 are the light quarks @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the cross section for the single @xmath0 production can reach @xmath187 fb , including all parameter restrictions , and the dominant decay modes are to light quarks , @xmath192 being favored by the choice of parametrization , and @xmath193 and @xmath194 by the restrictions on the right handed ckm .",
    "models which predict extra @xmath7 bosons all have features that distinguish them from @xmath0 bosons in lrsm . in warped extra - dimensional models @xcite",
    ", the coupling of the extra charged gauge bosons to light quarks and leptons is suppressed relative to those in sm . by contrast , in lrm , the decays to leptons might be suppressed for heavy right - handed neutrinos , whereas @xmath195 has no missing energy so the signal can be reconstructed in full . the irreducible sm background from the electroweak process ( single top production )",
    "is shown to be smaller than the signal inside the resonance region .",
    "warped rs models need luminosities of @xmath196 fb@xmath184 for a @xmath7 to reach a statistically significant signal , and expected @xmath7 masses are in the 2 - 3 tev region .",
    "technicolor or composite higgs @xcite models are expected to give very similar signals , as the warped extra dimensional model is dual to the 4d strong dynamics involved in electroweak symmetry breaking . in the little higgs models",
    "@xcite , the heavy @xmath197 is left - handed and the partial width to each fermion species is almost the same ( for massless fermions ) . in ued , the additional ( kk ) w and z bosons",
    "expected to have masses in the 100 - 200 gev region @xcite , have their hadronic decays closed , so they decay democratically to all lepton ( one kk and one ordinary ) flavors .    a clear signal for a charged vector boson will be much more significant that one for a neutral @xmath8 boson , as it would restrict the extension of the gauge sector .",
    "our analysis is complementary to previous analyses which indicate how to find whether the extra charged @xmath7 boson is left or right - handed , by presenting the signals expected for @xmath0 in lrm , both manifest ( with @xmath185 ) and in a case where @xmath33 , constrained by b and k phenomenology , is independent on the mixing in the left - handed quark sector and characterized by a single parameter .",
    "the signal for such a charged gauge boson is significantly different than in other scenarios with extra @xmath7s and would be an irrefutable signal of left - right symmetry .",
