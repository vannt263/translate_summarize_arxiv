    "one of the most useful ways to produce new solutions of the einstein constraint equations is via gluing techniques .",
    "the standard gluing construction is the following : we presume that @xmath0 is an einstein initial data set , with @xmath1 a smooth @xmath2-dimensional manifold , @xmath3 a riemannian metric on @xmath1 , and @xmath4 a symmetric tensor field on @xmath1 .",
    "we further assume that this set of data satisfies the ( vacuum ) einstein constraint equations @xmath5 which are the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath0 to generate a spacetime solution of the ( vacuum ) einstein gravitational field equations via the cauchy problem @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath6 is the divergence operator , @xmath7 is the trace operator , @xmath8 is the scalar curvature , and @xmath9 is the tensor norm , all corresponding to the metric @xmath3 . )    choosing a pair of points @xmath10 , one shows that there is a family of new solutions @xmath11 of the constraint equations in which ( i ) @xmath12 is obtained from @xmath1 by ( connected sum ) surgery joining @xmath13 and @xmath14 and ( ii ) outside of a neighborhood of the connected sum bridge in @xmath12 , the data @xmath15 can be made as close as desired to @xmath16 ( in a sense to be made precise later ) by taking @xmath17 sufficiently small .",
    "we note that this gluing construction allows for the possibility that the manifold @xmath1 consists of two disconnected components ; then if @xmath13 is chosen to lie in one of the components and @xmath14 in the other , the new glued solution effectively connects two disconnected solutions of the constraint equations .",
    "the mathematics and the utility of the gluing of solutions of the einstein constraint equations are discussed in a series of papers @xcite , which show that gluing can be carried out for a wide variety of initial data sets : they can be compact , asymptotically euclidean (  ae \" ) , or asymptotically hyperbolic (  ah \" ) , and they can be vacuum solutions or non - vacuum solutions with various coupled matter fields .",
    "this past work shows that in some cases the gluing can be done so that the glued solution exactly matches the original one outside the gluing region , so long as certain nondegeneracy conditions (  no kids \" ) hold at the points of gluing .",
    "when this can be done , the gluing is said to be _",
    "localized_. more generally , the glued solutions may not exactly match the original ones outside the gluing region , but can be constructed so that the data set is arbitrarily close to the original solution away from this region ; this is called _ non - localized _ gluing .",
    "say one chooses a pair of ( disjoint ) asymptotically hyperbolic solutions of the constraints and glues them at a pair of points satisfying the necessary conditions , as described in either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "if each of the original ah data sets has a single ( connected ) asymptotic region ( as described below in section [ sec : ahid ] ) , then the glued data set , which is also asymptotically hyperbolic , necessarily has two disjoint asymptotic regions .",
    "if we are working with ah initial data sets which are viewed as data on partial cauchy surfaces that intersect null infinity in an asymptotically simple spacetime @xcite , then the existence of multiple asymptotic regions is problematic for physical modeling .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show that one can glue asymptotically hyperbolic solutions of the constraint equations in such a way that in fact the asymptotic region of the glued data set is connected .",
    "the idea , which is modeled after the studies of mazzeo and pacard on gluing asymptotically hyperbolic einstein manifolds @xcite , is to use the conformally compactified representation of asymptotically hyperbolic geometries , which models a complete , asymptotically hyperbolic manifold as the interior of a compact manifold with boundary ( see section [ sec : ahid ] below ) .",
    "the boundary of this manifold , which we call the _ ideal boundary _ , is not part of the physical initial manifold , but represents asymptotic directions at infinity .",
    "the gluing is done using points @xmath13 and @xmath14 lying on the ideal boundary . in this context",
    ", we will use the term _ asymptotic region _ to refer to any open collar neighborhood of the boundary , with the boundary itself deleted .",
    "if the original manifold has a single connected asymptotic region , then so does the glued manifold .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . )",
    "if the original manifold has two disjoint connected asymptotic regions with one boundary point chosen on the ideal boundary of each region , then the glued manifold will have a single connected asymptotic region ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "( although the ideal boundary in fig .  [ fig:1 ] appears to be disconnected , in the cases of interest the boundary of the glued manifold will be a connected sum of connected @xmath18-manifolds , which is always connected . )    the results we present here do not hold for general ah initial data sets .",
    "we require that the data have constant mean curvature (  cmc \" ) , in the sense that @xmath19 is constant on @xmath1 .",
    "also , our results thus far provide sufficient conditions for ( asymptotic ) non - localized gluing . in a future paper",
    ", we hope to both eliminate the cmc restriction , and find conditions which are sufficient for the gluing to be localized .",
    "to set up our work here , we start in section [ sec : prelim ] with a definition and discussion of asymptotically hyperbolic initial data and their polyhomogeneous behavior in the asymptotic region .",
    "the section continues with a brief description of the conformal method for generating solutions of the constraint equations and the simplifications of the method which occur for constant mean curvature data .",
    "the conformal method is discussed here because it plays an important role both in constructing basic examples of ah initial data @xcite and in carrying out our gluing procedure .",
    "we conclude section [ sec : prelim ] with an overview of those aspects of @xcite on which our work relies .",
    "we state our main theorem in section [ sec : main - thm ] .",
    "we then carry out the first part of the gluing construction (  splicing \" ) in section [ sec : imp ] , producing a family of initial data sets depending on a small parameter @xmath17 , which satisfy the constraint equations approximately .",
    "our splicing construction is modeled after the construction of asymptotically hyperbolic einstein metrics in @xcite .",
    "the proof of the main theorem relies on the use of weighted hlder spaces .",
    "we define and discuss these spaces in section [ sec : analysis ] , following @xcite . in the rest of section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we study certain elliptic operators which act on weighted hlder spaces , and prove that they are invertible with norms of their inverses bounded uniformly in @xmath17 .",
    "one of the key steps here is a blow - up analysis argument similar to that of @xcite .",
    "our analytical results are applied in section [ sec : correcting - ii ] to correcting the traceless part of the glued second fundamental form .",
    "finally , in section [ lish ] we use results of @xcite and a contraction mapping argument to solve the lichnerowicz equation and complete the proof of the main theorem .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we define and discuss examples of asymptotically hyperbolic initial data sets .",
    "we also review the conformal method for creating solutions of the constraint equations .",
    "the model for asymptotically hyperbolic initial data sets is the hyperboloid in @xmath20-dimensional minkowski space , @xmath21 together with its induced riemannian metric @xmath22 ( which is a model for the hyperbolic metric of constant sectional curvature @xmath23 ) and its extrinsic curvature @xmath24 ; it is straightforward to check that @xmath25 satisfies and .    roughly speaking , an asymptotically hyperbolic initial data set @xmath26 is one in which the riemannian metric @xmath3 is complete and approaches constant negative curvature as one approaches the ends of the manifold , and the extrinsic curvature @xmath4 asymptotically approaches a pure trace tensor field that is a constant multiple of the metric .",
