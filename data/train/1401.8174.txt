    "for quite some time it was not known whether there exist seven points in the euclidean plane , no three on a line , no four on a circle , with pairwise integral distances .",
    "kreisel and kurz  @xcite found such a set of size  @xmath3 , but it is unknown if there exists one of size  @xmath4.-clusters . ] the hunt for those point sets was initiated by ulam in 1945 by asking for a dense point set in the plane with pairwise rational distances .",
    "here we study a kind of opposite problem , recently considered by the authors for euclidean spaces , see @xcite : given a normed space @xmath1 , what is the maximum volume @xmath5 of an open set @xmath6 with @xmath7 connected components without a pair of points at integral distance .",
    "we drop some technical assumptions for the normed spaces @xmath1 and mostly consider the euclidean spaces @xmath8 or @xmath9 equipped with a @xmath10-norm .",
    "in theorem  [ main_thm ] we state an explicit formula for the euclidean case @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that our normed space @xmath1 admits a measure , which we denote by @xmath12 . by @xmath13",
    "we denote the open ball with diameter one in @xmath1 , i.e.  the set of points with distance smaller than @xmath14 from a given center . in the special case @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the famous gamma function , i.e.  the extension of the factorial function . in the manhattan metric ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath20 , the volumes of the resulting cross - polytopes equal @xmath21 and in the maximum norm , i.e.@xmath22 , the volumes of the resulting hypercubes equal @xmath23 .    at",
    "first we observe that the diameter of a connected component @xmath24 of a set @xmath6 avoiding integral distances is at most @xmath23 . in @xmath1",
    "is at most @xmath25 , see e.g.  @xcite . ]",
    "otherwise we can consider two points @xmath26",
    "having a distance larger than @xmath23 and conclude the existence of a point @xmath27 on the curve connecting @xmath28 with @xmath29 in @xmath24 such that the distance between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is exactly @xmath23 .    given two points @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , we may consider the line @xmath32 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath1 to @xmath33 yields another , one - dimensional , normed space , where we can pose the same question .",
    "we consider the map @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is not injective on @xmath38 , the set @xmath0 contains a pair of point an integral distance apart .",
    "since the map @xmath37 is length preserving modulo @xmath23 , that is , @xmath39 , its restriction to the connected components of @xmath40 is length preserving .",
    "thus , we conclude the necessary condition for an open set avoiding integral distances that the length of each intersection with a line is at most @xmath23 .",
    "having those two necessary conditions , i.e.  the diameter of each connected component is at most @xmath23 and the length of each line intersection is at most @xmath23 , at hand we define @xmath41 as the maximum volume of open sets in @xmath1 with @xmath7 connected components , which satisfy the two necessary conditions .",
    "we thus have @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "in @xcite the authors provided an example of a connected open set @xmath44 such that the intersection of @xmath45 with each line has a total length of at most @xmath23 but the volume of @xmath45 is unbounded .    based on a simple averaging argument ,",
    "any given upper bound on one of the two introduced maximum volumes for @xmath7 components induces an upper bound for @xmath46 components in the same normed space @xmath1 :    for each @xmath46 we have , [ lemma_averaging ]    * @xmath47 whenever @xmath48 ; * @xmath49 whenever @xmath50 .    for lower bounds we consider the following construction .",
    "given a small constant @xmath51 , we arrange one open ball of diameter @xmath52 and @xmath53 open balls of diameter @xmath54 each , so that there centers are aligned on a line and that they are non - intersecting .",
    "since everything fits into an open ball of diameter @xmath23 there can not be a pair of points at integral distance . as @xmath55 the volume of the constructed set approaches @xmath25 , so that we have @xmath56 we then have @xmath57 .",
    "the map @xmath37 shows that equality is also attained for normed spaces @xmath1 of dimension @xmath23 .",
    "so , in the following we consider sets consisting of at least two components and normed spaces of dimension at least two .",
    "for one component the extremal example was the open ball of diameter @xmath23 . by choosing the line through the centers of two balls of diameter @xmath23",
    "we obtain a line intersection of total length two , so that this can not happen in an integral distance avoiding set . the idea to circumvent",
    "this fact is to truncate the open balls in direction of the line connecting the centers so that both components have a width of almost @xmath14 , see figure  [ fig_two_component_construction_euclidean_plane ] for the euclidean plane @xmath58 .",

    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "equality holds iff @xmath64 is the @xmath2-dimensional spherical symmetric slice with diameter  @xmath61 and minimal width  @xmath62 .",
    "we can easily check that the maximum volume of two @xmath2-dimensional spherical symmetric slices with diameter @xmath23 each and minimal widths @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , so that @xmath67 is attained at @xmath68 , independently from the dimension .",
    "motivated by this fact we generally define @xmath69 to be a spherical symmetric slice with diameter @xmath23 and width @xmath14 , i.e.  a truncated open ball . in the @xmath2-dimensional euclidean case",
    "we have @xmath70 the truncated disc in dimension @xmath71 has an area of @xmath72 .     for the maximum norm , @xmath22 , and the manhattan metric , @xmath20 . ]    on the left hand side of figure  [ fig_spherical_slices ] we have drawn the spherical slice , i.e.  a truncated ball , in dimension @xmath73 for the maximum norm , i.e.  @xmath22 .",
    "for general dimension @xmath2 we have @xmath74 . on the right hand side of figure  [ fig_spherical_slices ] we have drawn the spherical slice in dimension @xmath73 for the manhattan metric , i.e.  @xmath20 .",
    "here we have @xmath75 .",
    "since the line through the upper left _ corner _ of the left component and the lower right _ corner _ of the right component should have an intersection with the shaded region of total length at most @xmath23 , we consider truncated open balls of diameter @xmath76 and width @xmath77 , see figure  [ fig_two_component_construction_euclidean_plane ] .",
    "for some special normed spaces @xmath1 we can choose @xmath78 and move the centers of the two components sufficiently away from each other such that we can guarantee that no line intersection has a total length of more than @xmath23 .",
    "[ lemma_two_components ] for arbitrary dimension @xmath79 and normed spaces @xmath15",
    "with @xmath80 we have @xmath81 .    for a given small @xmath78 place a truncated open ball of diameter @xmath76 and width @xmath77 with its center at the origin and a second copy",
    "so that the two centers are at distance @xmath82 , see figure  [ fig_two_component_construction_euclidean_plane ] for @xmath83 . since both components have diameters smaller than @xmath23 there can not be a pair of points at integral distance within the same component .",
    "so let @xmath84 be a point of the left and @xmath85 a point of the right component , where we assume that the centers of the components are moved apart along the first coordinate axis . by construction",
    "the distance between @xmath86 and @xmath87 is at least @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath91 the distance between @xmath86 and @xmath87 is less than @xmath92 by choosing a sufficiently large integer @xmath88 we can guarantee that this term is at most @xmath93 , so that there is no pair of points at integral distance .",
    "finally , we consider the limit as @xmath55 .",
    "we conjecture that the lower bound from lemma  [ lemma_two_components ] is sharp for all @xmath94 and remark that this is true for the euclidean case @xmath95 by inequality  ( [ ie_isoperimetric_width ] ) .",
    "in this section we restrict the connected components to open balls of diameter @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that if an integral distance avoiding set contains an open ball of diameter @xmath96 , which fits into one of its components , then the other components can contain open balls of diameter at most @xmath97 .",
    "one can easily check that the maximum volume of the entire set @xmath0 is attained at @xmath98 , at least for @xmath10-norms and dimensions @xmath79 .",
    "if the set @xmath0 , i.e.  the collection of @xmath7 open balls of diameter @xmath14 , does not contain a pair of points at integral distance , then the mutual distances between centers of different balls have to be elements of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore dilating @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath73 yields the set @xmath100 of the centers of the @xmath7 balls with pairwise odd integral distances .",
    "however , for euclidean spaces @xmath8 , it is known , see @xcite , that @xmath101 , where equality is possible if and only if @xmath102 .",
    "it would be interesting to determine the maximum number of odd integral distances in other normed spaces .",
    "assuming that the construction using truncated open balls from section  [ sec_two_components ] is best possible or , at the very least , competitive , we can try to arrange @xmath7 copies of those @xmath69 .",
    "since we have to control that each line meets at most two components we can not arrange the centers on a certain line . on the other hand , the cutting directions , i.e.  the directions where we cut of the caps from the open balls , should be almost equal . to meet both requirements , we arrange the centers of the components on a parabola , where each component has diameter @xmath76 and width @xmath77 , for a small constant @xmath78 , see figure  [ fig_n_component_construction ] for an example in @xmath58 .",
    "[ lemma_n_components ] for arbitrary dimension @xmath79 , @xmath103 , and normed spaces @xmath15",
    "with @xmath94 we have @xmath104 .    for a given small @xmath78 consider @xmath7 truncated @xmath2-dimensional balls @xmath69 of width @xmath77 , where the truncation is oriented in the direction of the @xmath105-axis , with centers located at @xmath106 and diameter @xmath76 for @xmath107 , see figure  [ fig_n_component_construction ] .",
    "for @xmath88 large , there is no line intersecting three or more components .",
    "it remains to check that each line meeting two @xmath2-dimensional balls centered at @xmath108 , @xmath109 has an intersection of length at most @xmath14 with each of the truncated balls .",
    "this can be done by performing a similar calculation as in the proof of lemma  [ lemma_two_components ] .",
    "again , we consider the limiting configuration as @xmath55 .",
    "we conjecture that the lower bound in lemma  [ lemma_n_components ] is sharp .",
    "in order to modify the construction from the previous section to obtain a lower bound for @xmath5 , we use results from diophantine approximation and :    [ lemma_diagonals_p_gon ] given an odd prime @xmath10 , let @xmath110 for @xmath111 , where the @xmath112 are @xmath113th roots of unity",

    "we conclude @xmath126 since the occurring distances @xmath125 are given by @xmath127 for @xmath111 we look for a solution of the following system of inequalities @xmath128 with @xmath129 , where @xmath130 denotes the positive fractional part of a real number  @xmath131 , i.e.  there exists an integer @xmath132 with @xmath133 and @xmath134 . by lemma  [ lemma_diagonals_p_gon ] the factors @xmath135 are irrational and linearly independent over @xmath115 , so by weyl s theorem @xcite the systems admit a solution for all @xmath88 .",
