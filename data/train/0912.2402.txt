    "the property of entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum mechanics in general  @xcite .",
    "continuous variable ( cv ) entangled states are very attractive in this regard due to the relative easiness in their generation and manipulation , as compared to their discrete counterpart  @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of entanglement between two distant sites of a quantum network usually decreases exponentially with the length of a connecting channel , calling for the implementation of some entanglement purification procedures  @xcite .",
    "this involves purifying mixed entangled states , such as those that are obtained when the two halves of the paradigmatic cv entangled state , the two - mode squeezed state @xcite , have been distributed through noisy channels .",
    "for this purpose , we recall that a procedure involving solely gaussian local operations and classical communications does not lead to increase of the initial entanglement  @xcite , and that non - gaussian local operations must necessarily take part of any entanglement purification protocol  @xcite .",
    "in this article we propose a scheme for increasing the cv entanglement of two traveling optical field : each beam is sent to a local node where it interacts in an appropriate way with atoms . in the limit in which the photonic field is coherent over a large number of atoms , a collective ensemble excitation is created .",
    "this excitation can be described by a continuous variable , a bosonic mode , and its interaction with the input optical mode realizes the first part of a purification protocol .",
    "the second important part is the non - gaussian measurement , implemented through a dichotomic measure of presence or absence of atomic excitations in the ensemble .",
    "an alternative realization for the local node can be a single atom tightly confined by a harmonic potential , where the bosonic mode are the center - of - mass excitations , which are interfaced with light by means of the mechanical effects of atom - photon interactions  @xcite . in this case , the dichotomic measure consists in detecting whether or not the atom is in the ground state of the oscillator  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the efficiency of the protocol for the case when the optical modes are initially prepared in a two - mode thermal squeezed state , and show that the protocol is able to increase entanglement of the quantum state of the fields at the output with respect to the entanglement they possessed at the input .",
    "we remark that , apart for quantum communication , the possibility to increase the available entanglement is helpful in various scenarios , such as for instance in quantum metrology . here , entangled states allow to achieve the ultimate sensitivity allowed by the heisenberg limit in phase - sensitive measurements , such as those employed in atomic clocks , and in weak force detection @xcite .",

    "iii we use the characteristic function for the state of the system in order to evaluate the fidelity of the scheme . in section",

    "the scheme for achieving cv entanglement purification of two optical modes is described in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . two entangled light fields , with photon annihilation operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , propagates towards distant locations , where each field impinges onto an atomic ensemble .",
    "each ensemble is homogeneously broadened and is constituted by a large number of identical atoms , whose relevant electronic transitions are composed by two stable states @xmath2 and @xmath3 coupled to a common excited state @xmath4 , and forming a @xmath5 configuration .",
    "the impinging field is far - off - resonantly coupled to the transition @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) with strength @xmath8 , while a classical laser drives the transition @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) with coupling strength @xmath9 ( the two possible excitation models implement different dynamics , as discussed below ) .",

    "the resulting effective interaction is a coherent two - photon coupling between the stable states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while spontaneous emission processes are negligible . in the following treatment",
    "we assume that density and size of the ensembles are essentially equal , so that the laser and input - field parameters can be taken to be the same for both atomic ensembles .      in this paper",

    "for the schemes discussed in what follows , it is assumed that the atoms are all initially prepared in the internal state @xmath2 .",

    "the input field couples to the atomic transition @xmath14 , while the laser drives the transition @xmath15 . in the regime",
    "in which the excited state is far - off resonance , it can be adiabatically eliminated and the dynamics of quantum field and atomic excitations can be described by the effective hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath16 where the index @xmath17 denotes the input optical mode and the atomic ensemble it impinges on , and @xmath18 the collective spin operator for the corresponding ensemble . here",

    "therefore , when the number of excited atoms is much smaller than the total number of atoms , the collective internal atomic excitation can be treated as continuous variable and the light - atom interaction for the setup of fig .",

    "we assume also in this case that @xmath35 .",
    "the two effective hamiltonians introduced in this section determine the interaction between fields and atoms discussed in this paper .",
    "the assumption of hamiltonian dynamics is of course correct when incoherent processes can be neglected during the protocol . on the one hand ,",
    "as we already remarked , only stable atomic states are involved in the dynamics , while radiative decay can be neglected due to off - resonant excitation .",
    "moreover , it is also reasonable to neglect dephasing of the two metastable states which may arise from collisions between the atoms of the gas , since for sufficiently dilute media the relevant coherence between the levels @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be maintained for a sufficiently long time  @xcite .",
    "one could avoid the effects of atomic collisions by choosing cold atoms , very dilute gases , or defects in solid matrices as rare - earth - doped solids , the latter suffering however from inhomogeneous broadening  @xcite .",
    "in such a case one has a smaller optical depth which , in our model , means smaller coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 , imposing longer interaction times .",
    "a further possibility is to employ nodes based on single atoms in traps , using the center - of - mass motion as bosonic mode . in this case",
    "large optical depth can be achieved by means of optical elements , such as a fiber or a cavity . in this context",
    "we note that the dynamics described by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : heffparam ] ) and  ( [ eq : heffbs ] ) can be derived for this specific setup , where @xmath38 is here the cavity mode operator and @xmath39 the operator annihilating an excitation of the center - of - mass motion , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the case of atomic ensembles ,",
    "an implicit but important physical assumption of our description is perfect spatial mode matching between each optical mode impinging on the atomic ensemble and the quantum optical modes naturally excited by the driven atomic medium in the @xmath5 configuration . assuming perfect mode matching means that the output field mode emerging from the atomic ensemble after the interaction ( and the measurement ) is exactly the same optical mode entering the ensemble and therefore they are described by the same bosonic operators @xmath40 . in general , however , the spatial properties of the emerging field are determined by the geometric configuration of the gas cell and of the driving classical beams @xcite and",

    "such limitation could be overcome with suitable optics techniques .",
    "significant results with entangled single photon beams have been recently achieved  @xcite .",
    "after the interaction with the atomic ensemble , the second step leading to entanglement purification is a non - gaussian operation . the easiest way to implement",
    "it is to measure the state of the ancillary modes ( the atomic collective modes ) , checking if a bosonic mode is in its vacuum state or not .",
    "this consists in measuring whether each ensemble possesses or not spin excitations . in the case of an optical mode",
    "this projective measurement is performed by single - photon on - off detectors which check if there is at least one photon in the mode . in an atomic system",

    "the detection procedure hence requires to distinguish no excitations from the presence of at least one excitation . for the atomic ensemble case ,",
    "this requires measurement procedures like the one discussed in refs .",
    "when the node is a trapped ion , the procedure can be implemented by means of transferring the population of the ground state of the oscillator from the initial electronic state into a hide qubit and measuring the resonance fluorescence of the electronic state in a closed optical transition  @xcite .",

    "in particular , we have extended the analysis to input thermal states and we have analyzed the performance in terms of a new global efficiency parameter which takes into account also the success probability of the protocol . as a byproduct of our analysis we have shown that , if the role of the optical and atomic excitation mode are exchanged such that one performs the non - gaussian measurement on the optical modes , one swaps entanglement between optical and atomic modes , thereby increasing the final entanglement of the atomic excitations over the initial one of the optical fields .",
    "in this case , we find a small improvement of the fidelity even when the interaction is of the parametric - amplifier type .    the present protocol could be extended to the situation , in which the distant nodes are single atoms tightly confined by harmonic traps and inside high - q resonators . in this case , the harmonic motion of the atomic center - of - mass plays the role of the ensemble excitation in the protocol , and a beam - splitter or parametric interaction with the input , optical field can be tailored by using an external laser field  @xcite .",
