    "a solution of this system is an _ integral curve _",
    "@xmath9 tangent to @xmath10 whose values define the states of the dynamical system described by equation ( [ eqgi1 ] ) .",
    "since none of the components @xmath11 of the velocity vector field depends here explicitly on time , the system is said to be autonomous .",
    "the integral of the system ( [ eqgi1 ] ) can be associated with the coordinates , i.e. , with the position , of a point m at the instant @xmath6 .",
    "the total derivative of @xmath12 namely the instantaneous acceleration vector @xmath13 may be written , while using the chain rule , as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the functional jacobian matrix @xmath16 of the system ( [ eqgi1 ] ) .",
    "then , the _ integral curve _ defined by the vector function @xmath17 of the scalar variable @xmath6 representing the trajectory of m can be considered as a _ plane _ or a _ space curve _ which has local metrics properties namely _ curvature _ and _",

    "proof of this theorem may be found in @xcite .    if @xmath30 then @xmath22 is first integral of the dynamical system defined by ( [ eqgi1 ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath22 is first integral of the dynamical system defined by @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is constant .",
    "proof of this theorem may be found in @xcite .",
    "according to the previous theorems 1 and 2 the following proposition may be established .",
    "the location of the points where the local curvature of the trajectory curves integral of a two dimensional dynamical system defined by ( [ eqgi1 ] ) vanishes is first integral of this system .",
    "moreover , the invariant curve thus defined is over flowing invariant with respect to the dynamical system ( [ eqgi1 ] ) .",

    "proof of this theorem may be found in @xcite .",
    "according to this method it is possible to show that any dynamical system defined by ( [ eqgi1 ] ) possess an invariant manifold which is endowing stability with the trajectory curves , restoring thus the loss determinism inherent to the non - integrability feature of these systems .",
    "so , this method may be also applied to any complex system such that predator - prey models , neuronal bursting models ... but , in order to give the most simple and consistent application , let s focus on two classical examples :    * the balthazar van der pol model ; * the lorenz model .",
    "the oscillator of b. van der pol @xcite is a second - order system with non - linear frictions which can be written : @xmath33 the particular form of the friction which can be carried out by an electric circuit causes a decrease of the amplitude of the great oscillations and an increase of the small .",
