    "pair production was first proposed for electron - positron pairs in strong , temporally and spatially constant electric fields @xcite .",
    "today it is often referred to as the schwinger @xcite mechanism . as a nonperturbative mechanism ,",
    "pair production is of great theoretical interest . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", it corresponds to probing the theory in the domain of strong fields .",
    "consequently , we encounter pair production in many topics of contemporary physics , for instance , black hole evaporation @xcite and @xmath2 creation in the vicinity of charged black holes @xcite as well as particle production in hadronic collisions @xcite and in the early universe @xcite .",
    "since qed pair production in strong fields represents the conceptually simplest case , it can serve as a theoretical laboratory for all these cases .",
    "a sizeable rate for spontaneous pair production requires extraordinary strong electric fields , comparable in size to the so - called critical field strength , which corresponds to the electron - mass scale , @xmath3 . for a long time",
    ", it seemed inconceivable to produce macroscopic electric fields of the required strength in the laboratory , but today , with the development of strong lasers , there are several promising experiments in progress @xcite ; for a discussion of experimental requirements , see @xcite .",
    "many different theoretical methods , such as the propertime method @xcite , wkb techniques @xcite , the schrdinger - functional approach @xcite , functional techniques @xcite , kinetic equations @xcite , various instanton techniques @xcite , borel summation @xcite , and propagator constructions @xcite , have been developed to study pair production in external fields . also , finite - temperature contributions have been determined which first occur at the two - loop level @xcite .",
    "of particular conceptual interest is the production rate in terms of the effective action for a given background , which is also used in this work . owing to an intimate relation between the effective action and the vacuum - persistence amplitude , it is the imaginary part of the effective action that encodes information about pair production which , in this context , is interpreted as spontaneous vacuum decay .",
    "this approach yields the instantaneous production rate , neglecting back - reactions and memory effects .",
    "however , this rate can serve as a source term for kinetic equations , which can then take back - reactions and memory effects into account @xcite .    even though the existing methods follow a well defined and technically stringent concept",
    ", their application often faces serious technical and conceptual difficulties . up to now , no reliable and universal method  be it analytic or numeric  is available for the calculation of pair - production rates in inhomogeneous electric fields . in standard approaches ,",
    "functional traces have to be evaluated with the knowledge of the spectrum of the corresponding differential operator , which is only available for special cases .",
    "moreover , controlling the divergencies that possibly occur upon summing up the eigenvalues is a delicate task .    in the present work ,",
    "we solve these problems by using the recently developed numerical worldline techniques @xcite which are based on the string - inspired worldline formalism @xcite .",
    "the important advantage compared to other approaches lies in the fact that worldline numerics can be formulated independently of any symmetry of the background .",
    "the identification of and the summation over the spectrum of quantum fluctuations are done in one single and finite step .",
    "for simplicity , we confine ourselves to scalar qed ; generalization to spinor qed is , in principle , straightforward and will be discussed below .    beyond the computational advantages of worldline techniques , the worldline picture also helps to understand conceptual aspects in more depth .",
    "in particular , the nature and the role of nonlocalities become highly transparent from the worldline viewpoint , since the worldlines themselves represent extended virtual trajectories of the fluctuating particles in coordinate space . in the present context",
    ", we are aiming at the quantum effective action which , of course , receives nonlocal contributions in general .",
    "however , many standard approximation methods suppress ( or shade ) nonlocalities by construction , as , e.g. , the derivative expansion .",
    "hence , pair production as described by the schwinger formula is often recognized as a nonperturbative phenomenon , but not so much as a nonlocal phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , the latter property is crucial , as the following heuristic argument elucidates : in order for a virtual pair to become real , i.e. , on - shell , the pair must gain at least the amount of @xmath4 of energy ; this is only possible by propagating in opposite directions in the electric field .",
    "this delocalization of the pair wave function is mandatory for gaining sufficient energy .    in constant electric fields ,",
    "this delocalization remains invisible in the final result .",
    "by contrast , in inhomogeneous fields the spacetime dependence of the delocalized wave function matters a great deal and can even dominate the resulting effect , as our results demonstrate . in the worldline picture",
    ", the nonlocal effects already become transparent on the level of the formalism , since the extended worldlines exactly describe the delocalization of a virtual pair .    at this point",
    ", we would like to stress the difference of the present work to earlier applications of worldline numerics . whereas the algorithms developed so far in @xcite have proven their capabilities for computing the real part of the effective action ( and action densities ) , the computation of the imaginary part is by no means a straightforward generalization .",
    "the reason for this lies in the truly minkowskian nature of the problem of pair production : vacuum decay only occurs for real , i.e. , minkowskian , electric fields .",
    "this contrasts with the indispensable necessity of a euclidean formulation for solving the worldline integrals by a statistical monte carlo algorithm . in practice , this results in an overlap problem : the finite euclidean worldline ensemble can have little overlap with those worldlines that contribute dominantly to minkowski - valued observables .",
    "we solve this fundamental problem by resorting to a technique developed in @xcite in the different context of nonperturbative euclidean worldline numerics : we fit a suitable cumulative density function ( cdf ) of the euclidean ensemble to a physically motivated ansatz that can be continued analytically to minkowski space .",
    "we should emphasize that this continuation represents an extrapolation of certain ensemble properties to minkowski space which is an a priori uncontrolled procedure resulting in systematic errors .",
    "we check this extrapolation carefully against various analytically known results and find negligibly small systematic errors compared to the statistical monte carlo errors .",
    "hence , we regard the overlap problem as solved for the present problem . this solution is obtained at the expense of numerical cost ; moreover , the algorithm can , in principle , not be made arbitrarily precise , in contrast to former applications of worldline numerics .",
    "nevertheless , for the problem of pair production and as far as the experimentally required accuracy is concerned , we believe that our algorithm is sufficiently powerful .",
    "the vacuum - persistence amplitude can be related to the effective action @xmath5 in minkowski space , @xmath6 the corresponding probability for the vacuum to decay spontaneously is @xmath7 in the case of qed with electric background fields , vacuum decay occurs in the form of spontaneous pair production , the production rate per unit time and volume of which is directly proportional to the imaginary part of the effective action density ( effective lagrangian ) .    in scalar qed , the one - loop contribution to the euclidean effective action @xmath8 reads @xmath9=\\ln\\mathrm{det}\\left(-(\\partial+iea)^2+m^2\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath8 differ by a minus sign , @xmath10 . in the worldline approach ,",

    "( [ eq : wew1 ] ) suppresses the contribution of long paths .",
    "therefore , the integral is dominated by paths that tightly wiggle around the common center of mass .",
    "this gives rise to the picture of a _ loop cloud _ sitting at @xmath14 and scanning the background field in the neighborhood of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the nonlocal nature of the phenomenon is already apparent in the formalism .",

    "the fluctuations cancel each other , so that they have no effect on the integrated quantity .",
    "the numerical accuracy does not eliminate the possibility of a @xmath80-dependent structure for @xmath80 values larger than @xmath104 . according to the values of fig .",
    "[ fig : gammasinint ] , the central values suggest a slight increase of the pair production for @xmath125 , until it falls back to the result for the averaged field if @xmath126 . to definitely clarify this ,",
    "larger loop ensembles are necessary at the expense of cpu time .",
    "however , the present result shows that any possible @xmath80 dependence for @xmath125 has to be relatively small and the averaged - field approximation yields good results in this range .",
    "let us finally compare our results for the spatially sine - modulated field with those for spatially homogeneous fields with time dependencies . especially the case of an electric field oscillating in time with frequency @xmath127 has been studied with wkb methods @xcite which were originally developed for ionization processes in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the nature of pair production in this case depends on the size of the `` adiabaticity parameter '' @xmath128 ; for small @xmath129 , the result approaches the schwinger formula and pair production thus is a nonperturbative phenomenon . for large @xmath130 ,",
    "the result becomes perturbative in @xmath131 and pair production arises from multiphoton scattering . in our case , we can , of course , also form a similar parameter of the sine modulation introduces yet another scale . ]",
    "@xmath132 , with @xmath133 small or large roughly corresponding to the two limiting cases discussed above .",
    "however , it is important to stress that pair production is nonperturbative in both limits for our sine - modulated field . in particular",
    ", the large-@xmath134 ( or large @xmath135 ) case can not be understood in terms of multiphoton processes .",
    "taking the external field to all orders into account is essential for the final result .",
    "we have developed a new universal approach for computing local production rates for spontaneous pair creation by the schwinger mechanism in scalar qed .",
    "our method is based on the combination of the worldline formalism with monte carlo techniques . as a first result",
    ", we have not only rediscovered nikishov s analytic result for the total pair - production rate in a sauter potential , but moreover we have computed the local pair - production rate for this classic case for the first time .",
    "most importantly , the algorithm is not restricted to any spatial symmetry of the given background potential but is applicable for arbitrary potentials .    as a nontrivial example",
    ", we have applied the algorithm to a constant electric field modulated by a spatial sine oscillation .",
    "this field configuration is representative for a whole class of fields with large - scale structures and small - scale oscillations . by varying the spatial oscillation frequency ,",
    "qualitatively different features of pair production can be investigated . for small frequencies ,",
    "our numerical result agrees with the derivative expansion to lowest order ; the latter breaks down completely for spatial variations on the order of a few times the compton wavelength . on this length scale and below",
    ", our results show clearly that another approximation scheme becomes reliable : the local production rate can well be approximated by inserting the _ spatially averaged _ field into the schwinger formula .",
    "this averaged - field approximation can be trusted on the few - percent level for spatial variations of the size of the compton wavelength .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the small validity bound of the derivative expansion for the imaginary part of the effective action density is not related to the same observation for the real part , as discovered in @xcite ; the latter arises from a subtle interplay between nonlocal quantum contributions and local counterterms , whereas the imaginary part is not affected by renormalization counterterms .",
    "furthermore , the derivative expansion for the real part of the _ integrated _ effective action works well even for compton - scale variations @xcite , whereas it breaks down early for the imaginary part , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammasinint ] .",
    "apart from these quantitative results for the particular field configurations considered here , our findings emphasize the crucial role of nonlocalities in the phenomenon of pair production . without the feature of delocalization of a virtual pair",
    ", spontaneous vacuum decay would not occur .",
    "the worldline picture underlying our algorithm is particularly powerful in capturing these nonlocalities and , moreover , understanding their consequences in an intuitive way .",
    "especially our results for local pair - production rates illustrate the nature and the role of nonlocalities transparently .",
    "for instance , the seemingly paradoxical situation that maxima of pair - production rates can occur at minima of the field strength ( cf .",
    "[ secsine ] ) can not be understood from a local approximation .",
    "however , the worldline picture identifies a natural explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the delocalization properties of the virtual pairs described by the worldline trajectory .    from a technical perspective",
    ", we have developed a numerical monte carlo algorithm that on the one hand requires a euclidean formulation for the quantum fluctuations , but on the other hand produces reliable results for truly minkowski - valued physical observables .",
    "the inherent overlap problem is solved in the present context by a physically motivated ansatz for a suitable cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) to which the numerical data can be fitted and that can be analytically continued to minkowski space . even though the success of this procedure depends strongly on the problem at hand ,",
    "we believe that such techniques can be useful in other minkowski - valued problems as well .",
    "the algorithmic strategy itself has been invented in the context of euclidean field theory @xcite , where it has turned out to be highly powerful in a study of nonperturbative worldline dynamics .",
    "several extensions of our work are desirable and possible .",
    "so far , we have only considered spatial inhomogeneities , but any realistic field configuration will also exhibit variations in time .",
    "in fact , timelike variations bring in a new complication , since our monte carlo worldlines live in imaginary time , whereas physical fields depend on real time . therefore , our algorithm is directly applicable to all those cases where the physical field is known analytically , such that its analytic continuation to imaginary time can be evaluated and plugged into the numerics .",
    "for instance , the exact result for a solitonic profile in time direction as solved in @xcite will be a benchmark test for such an investigation .",
    "furthermore , our results can , in principle , straightforwardly be generalized to ordinary spinor qed . as a new complication ,",
    "the pauli term @xmath136 occurs in the worldline integrand .",
    "since this term depends also on the worldline trajectory , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the ensemble will not only depend on the quantity @xmath50 as defined in eq .",
    ", but also on the worldline averaged pauli - term exponential ; let us denote the latter with @xmath137 , which is also a scalar .",
    "our algorithm might be generalized as follows : first , compute the pdf of @xmath137 from the ensemble and bin the loops according to their @xmath137 value .",
    "then , apply the present algorithm to each @xmath137 bin separately ; in particular , the same analytic - continuation technique can be used . finally , integrate over @xmath137 with the aid of the pdf of @xmath137 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath137 integral can be done last , since the pauli - term worldline average can not induce any poles for the proper - time integral .",
    "of course , since each relevant @xmath137 bin has to contain sufficiently many worldlines , this generalization of our algorithm will at least be an order of magnitude more time consuming than the one for scalar qed . at this point",
    ", we should stress that the computations for the present work have still been performed on ordinary desktop pc s .    finally , it is instructive to compare our method to the instanton technique of @xcite , where the instanton approximation of the worldline integral has been shown to give the leading - order contribution to pair production .",
    "for instance , in the constant - field case , the one - pair - production rate is generated by one instanton which is a circular loop .",
    "small fluctuations around this path lead to the correct imaginary prefactor . in comparison to this , our worldlines are extraordinarily complex .",
    "not a single worldline loop in our ensembles resembles a circle or fluctuations thereof .",
    "this gives rise to the conjecture that the computation of the imaginary part requires very little information about the shape of the loops .",
    "we expect that we should be able to extract the instantonic content of our loops by a suitable cooling procedure that removes large - amplitude fluctuations . in view of the success of the instanton approximation",
    ", only instantonic plus small - amplitude - fluctuation information appears to be relevant for pair production .",
    "this agrees with our observation that pair production is induced by delocalized `` large '' loops that can acquire enough energy in the @xmath0 field .",
    "therefore , it is well possible that a different loop discretization which optimizes instantonic properties allows for an even more efficient computation of the imaginary part .",
    "a further investigation of this topic may lead to an even deeper understanding of pair production .",

    "in the following , we present a straightforward realization of worldline numerics for calculating the pair - production rate in the constant - field case . the algorithm presented here is an immediate generalization of the standard algorithm successfully used for the real part of the effective action @xcite . for a constant field in four dimensions ,",
    "( [ eq : gammaur ] ) reads @xmath138 where @xmath50 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wvoni ] ) , and the counterterms for on - shell renormalization are included .",
    "rotating the @xmath13 integration contour onto the imaginary axis and substituting @xmath139 yields a fourier integral , @xmath140 if the worldline - ensemble average @xmath141 can be computed reliably , eq .   offers a highly efficient algorithm with the aid of the fft : in this case , @xmath142 can be computed for a whole spectrum of frequencies @xmath143 all at once with fft . the resulting imaginary part is shown in fig . [ fig : imgammaw ] .",
    "it is highly remarkable that this numerical procedure gives satisfactory results in a wide range of scales , extending over five orders of magnitude , with little consumption of cpu time .",
    "however , the algorithm fails for small field strengths .",
    "the precise limit is given by the size of the largest loops in the finite loop ensemble : only loops with @xmath72 values larger than @xmath143 contribute to the imaginary part of @xmath142 .",
    "for weak fields , this implies that only a few or even no loops contribute and the computation fails .    beside this problem which is already relevant for the constant - field case",
    ", there is a second limitation . for a different contour in the complex @xmath13 plane which supports large @xmath145 values ,",
    "the wilson - loop expectation value is dominated by the loop with the largest @xmath50 value .",
    "the monte carlo algorithms break down here , since the error bars become as large as the central value . in general , for inhomogeneous background fields , it is not possible to find a suitable integration contour to avoid this problem .",
