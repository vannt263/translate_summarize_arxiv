    "in the mid-1990s seiberg argued @xcite that two distinct @xmath0yang  mills theories with appropriately chosen matter ( usually referred to as electric / magnetic theories ) can be equivalent in the infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "seiberg s duality was tested in a number of nontrivial ways ( it passed all tests with flying colors ) , was understood in the framework of string / d brane theory and became an important tool in the realm of strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "seiberg s duals have different gauge groups , say , su@xmath12 in the electric theory versus su@xmath13 in the magnetic one .",
    "the matter sectors of the electric and magnetic theories from the dual pair are related to each other in a well - defined manner .",
    "seiberg s duality was most extensively used in the so - called conformal window @xcite , in which both the original theory and its dual are conformally invariant . typically ,",
    "while one theory is strongly coupled the other one is at weak coupling which allows one to perform fully quantitative analysis of the weakly coupled theory , with predictions for scaling dimensions applicable to the strongly coupled dual theory in the conformal regime .",
    "seiberg s duality holds outside the conformal window too .",
    "it relates to each other massless states of the dual theories , one of which is infrared free .",
    "moreover , by itself it does not provide us with a confinement mechanism based on formation of confining strings ( flux tubes ) .",
    "the questions we address are : can seiberg s duality be generalized to include theories which at large distances exhibit non - abelian string - based confinement",
    "? can this duality connect with each other not only massless states but also massive ones ?",
    "below we will argue that the answers to these two questions are positive . to construct dual pairs with the above properties we will need a modest extension of ideas developed in connection with seiberg s duality previously @xcite . as well - known @xcite , large vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the squark fields in the electric theory translate into large mass terms of the  dual quarks \" in the magnetic theory and _",
    "vice versa_. with large vevs we higgs a part of the gauge group .",
    "the corresponding gauge bosons become heavy and can be integrated out . on the other side of duality",
    "the corresponding  dual quarks \" become heavy and can be integrated out .",
    "this procedure changes the ir behavior of each theory from the given dual pair , but their ir equivalence remains intact .",
    "we want to change the conformal ( or ir free regime ) in the infrared limit into a confining regime . to this",
    "end the above procedure must be modified .",
    "the modification we suggest is as follows .",
    "we start from an @xmath0sqcd with a certain number of the quark fields .",
    "the dynamical scale of this theory is @xmath14 .",
    "quark fields from a judiciously chosen subset are assumed to develop vevs which are small on the scale of @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining quark fields are endowed with a common mass term @xmath15 which is also small compared to @xmath14 , so that all  hadrons \" are dynamical ; none can be integrated out . we argue that within the framework of this deformation of seiberg s procedure , on the other side of duality , the ir free regime is deformed to give rise to a theory which supports flux tubes ( strings ) at weak coupling and confines non - abelian ( dual ) monopoles .",
    "a number of states in this theory are light in the sense that their mass tends to zero in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "we argue that via duality these light states are in one - to - one correspondence with the light states of the original theory .",
    "thus , duality gets extended to include ( in addition to massless moduli ) a part of the spectrum which is light compared to the natural dynamical scale @xmath14 _ but not massless_. we refer to such dual pairs as quark / monopole theories to distinguish them from seiberg s electric / magnetic theories .    extended",
    "duality allows us to analyze the monopole theory at weak coupling and make a number of highly nontrivial predictions for the quark theory light sector which is at strong coupling . in fact , the monopole theory we get is close to the so - called @xmath6 model developed previously @xcite with the purpose of studying non - abelian strings and confined non - abelian monopoles in @xmath0super - yang ",
    "mills theories .",
    "some distinctions of the monopole theory from the @xmath6 model ( e.g. non - bps nature of the flux tubes ) do not produce drastic changes of the dynamical pattern we arrive at compared to the dynamical pattern of the @xmath6 model .",
    "as was mentioned , the non - abelian monopoles must be important in seiberg s duality being related to `` dual quarks . ''",
    "we make one step further suggesting that the non - abelian monopoles _ are _ the `` dual quarks . ''",
    "the dual quark fields condense prividing ( small ) masses to all gauge bosons of the monopole theory .",
    "the way the monopole theory is higgsed is very peculiar  it corresponds to baryon - operator dominated vacuum in the quark theory . confined monopoles of the monopole theory are to be interpreted as certain  constituent quarks \" of the quark theory .",
    "both form @xmath3-plets of the global unbroken su@xmath4 theory which is present in the quark and monopole theories , on both sides of the extended duality .    to explain how this works we have to be more specific .",
    "what are the non - abelian monopoles ?    although the full answer is not yet known there are certain results which were obtained recently and which have a natural interpretation in the framework of  the non - abelian monopole \" hypothesis .",
    "let us start from the abelian t hooft - polyakov monopole @xcite of which we know everything .",
    "suppose we have a model with the su(2 ) gauge group broken down to u(1 ) by condensation of adjoint scalars @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "one can always align the adjoint condensate along the third axis in the su(2 ) space , @xmath19 the size of the t hooft - polyakov monopole is of the order of @xmath20 while its mass is of the order of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the gauge coupling constant . in the non - abelian limit",
    "@xmath23 the size of this state formally tends to infinity and its mass tends to zero , see @xcite for a thorough discussion .",
    "the monopole seems to disappear , at least classically , from the physical spectrum .",
    "however , from recent supersymmetric studies we learned that in some cases the monopoles become stabilized in the non - abelian limit by quantum effects .",
    "in particular , this happens to confined monopoles in @xmath24sqcd @xcite with the gauge group u(@xmath3 ) , the fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term for the u(1 ) factor and @xmath25 quark flavors .",
    "this theory supports non - abelian flux tubes  strings @xcite .",
    "they are formed upon quark condensation triggered by the fi term . the string orientational zero modes are associated with the rotation of their color flux inside the non - abelian gauge subgroup su(@xmath3 ) .",
    "non - abelian strings originate from the abelian @xmath26 strings in the special regime which ensures vanishing of vevs of the adjoint scalars , i.e. exactly in the non - abelian limit we are interested in .",
    "the internal dynamics of the orientational modes of the non - abelian strings are described by two - dimensional ( 2,2 ) supersymmetric cp@xmath27 model on the string worldsheet @xcite .",
    "the monopoles are confined by these stings .",
    "in fact , elementary monopoles are nothing but the junctions of elementary @xmath26 strings @xcite .",
    "it is possible to trace the fate of the confined monopoles @xcite  from the abelian regime ( with nonvanishing vevs of the adjoint fields ) where they are just the t hooft - polyakov monopoles slightly deformed by confinement effects , deep into the non - abelian limit of vanishing vevs of the adjoint fields . in this limit",
    "confined monopoles are seen as kinks of the cp@xmath27 model on the string worldsheet .",
    "they are stabilized by quantum effects .",
    "their size and mass are determined by the dynamical scale of the cp@xmath27 model .",
    "thus , in quantum theory confined monopoles do not disappear from the physical spectrum in the non - abelian limit .",
    "as was recently shown @xcite , breaking @xmath24supersymmetry down to @xmath0we do not necessarily destroy the above confined non - abelian monopoles .",
    "in particular , they still exist in the limit when the adjoint fields decouple altogether and no traces of `` abelization '' of the theory remain .",
    "these results lead us to the following conjecture . since the monopoles ( stabilized by quantum effects ) survive in the non - abelian limit in the confining phase it is plausible to suggest that they can exist also in other phases matching seiberg s notion of  dual quarks .",
    "\" it is natural then that the theory dual to @xmath0sqcd is formulated as a gauge theory of non - abelian monopoles . in particular , in our construction the monopoles ( a.k.a the quark fields of the monopole theory ) are in the higgs phase .",
    "we will show that this leads to formation of the non - abelian strings in the monopole theory whose tension is proportional to a ( fractional ) power of @xmath15 , which in the original ( quark ) theory must be interpreted as flux tubes of a  chromoelectric \" field .    to make our statement as clear as possible it is worth comparing it with what was achieved in the seiberg ",
    "witten solution @xcite .",
    "the low - energy limit of the @xmath28 theory is a u(1 ) theory .",
    "upon dualization it becomes @xmath28 sqed with matter fields representing massless monopoles .",

    ". then the original theory is slightly deformed by a mass term of the adjoint chiral superfield . to the leading order",
    "this deformation does not break @xmath28 supersymmetry of low - energy sqed .",

    "the worldsheet theory ( besides noninteracting translational and supertranslational moduli fields ) is nonsupersymmetric cp@xmath27 model , which has its own dynamics in the infrared . in particular , kinks of the cp@xmath27 model are @xmath3-plets of a global symmetry . in this sense our construction is closer to the qcd string , whatever it might be .    the paper is organized as follows . in sects .",
