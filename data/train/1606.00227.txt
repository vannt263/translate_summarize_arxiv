    "a complete understanding of cosmic star - formation history , and the physical mechanisms that drive galaxy formation and evolution , requires that we connect our uv / optical and infrared / mm views of the universe ( e.g. hopkins & beacom 2006 ; dunlop 2011 ; burgarella et al .",
    "2013 ; madau & dickinson 2014 ) . until the advent of alma ,",
    "these two views have been largely disconnected , for both technical and physical reasons .",
    "benefiting from low background and high angular resolution , deep uv / optical surveys have proved extremely effective at completing our inventory of _ unobscured _ star formation which , certainly at high redshift , is dominated by large numbers of low - mass galaxies with individual star - formation rates @xmath23 ( e.g. mclure et al .",

    "1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ; eales et al . 1999 ) .",
    "such objects have now been uncovered in significant numbers through far - ir / mm surveys with the jcmt ( e.g. scott et al .",

    "2013 ) .    while sub - mm surveys for high - redshift galaxies benefit from a strong negative k - correction ( provided by a modified blackbody spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ; blain & longair 1993 ; hughes et al . 1993 ; dunlop et al . 1994 ) , the high background and/or the relatively poor angular resolution provided by single - dish telescopes at these wavelengths means that they are only really effective at uncovering rare , extreme star - forming galaxies with @xmath25 ( albeit reaching down to @xmath26 in the very deepest scuba-2 450/850@xmath27 m imaging ; geach et al . 2013 ; roseboom et al . 2013 ; koprowski et al .",
    "the existence of such objects presents an interesting and important challenge to theoretical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. baugh et al . 2005 ; khochfar & silk 2009 ; dav et al . 2010 ; hayward et al . 2011 ; narayanan et al .",
    "2015 ) , but they provide only @xmath28% of the known far - infrared / mm background ( fixsen et al . 1998 ; scott et al . 2012 ; geach et al .",
    "2013 ) , and attempts to complete our inventory of obscured star formation have had to rely on stacking experiments ( e.g. peacock et al .",
    "2000 ; marsden et al . 2009 ; geach et al .",
    "2013 ; coppin et al . 2015 ) .",
    "a key goal , therefore , of deep surveys with alma is to close the depth / resolution gap between uv / optical and far - infrared / mm studies of the high - redshift universe , and hence enable a complete study of visible+obscured star formation within the overall galaxy population . over the last two years , alma has begun to make important contributions in this area .",
    "most early alma programmes have focused ( sensibly ) on pointed observations of known objects ( e.g. hodge et al .",

    "2015 , fujimoto et al . 2016",
    "; oteo et al .",
    "2016 ) albeit with interestingly different results .",
    "more recently , time has been awarded to programmes that aim to deliver contiguous alma mosaic imaging of small regions of sky with excellent multi - wavelength supporting data ( e.g. hatsukade et al .",
    "2015 ; umehata et al .",
    "such programmes offer not only further improvements in our knowledge of the sub - mm / mm source counts , but also the ability to determine the nature and physical properties ( redshifts , stellar masses , star - formation rates ) of the alma - detected galaxies .",
    "for example , alma 1.1-mm imaging of 1.5arcmin@xmath1 within the candels",
    "/ uds field ( pi : kohno ) has provided new results on the 1.1-mm counts , and enabled the study of several alma - detected galaxies ( hatsukade et al .",
    "2016 ; tadaki et al .",

    "however , to date , no homogeneous alma imaging has been undertaken within the best - studied region of deep ` blank - field ' sky , the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) . on scales of a few arcmin@xmath1 ,",
    "the hudf remains unarguably the key ultra - deep extragalactic survey field and , lying within the goods - south field at ra 03@xmath29 , dec @xmath3028@xmath31 , is ideally located for deep alma observations . while four of the six hubble frontier fields provide alternative target fields for deep alma observations , the quality of the optical  near - infrared data in these fields will never seriously rival that which has already been achieved in the hudf . in part",
    "this is due to the huge investment in _ hst _",
    "optical imaging in this field made prior to the degradation of the acs camera ( beckwith et al .",
    "however , it is also a result of the more recent investment in imaging with wfc3/ir on the _ hst _ since 2009 . specifically , the combination of the udf09 campaign ( oesch et al .",
    "2010 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ; illingworth et al .",
    "2013 ) followed by the udf12 programme ( ellis et al . 2013 ; koekemoer et al . 2013 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2013 ) , has delivered the deepest near - infrared imaging ever achieved ( reaching 30 ab mag , 5-@xmath32 ) over an area of 4.5arcmin@xmath1 . as a result of coupling this multi - band _ hst _ imaging with the recently augmented ultra - deep _ spitzer _ data ( labb et al .",
    "2015 ) , accurate photometric redshifts , stellar masses and uv star - formation rates are now known for @xmath33 galaxies in this field ( e.g. parsa et al .",
    "2016 ) . for a field of this size ,",
    "the hudf is also uniquely rich in optical / infrared _ spectroscopic _ information , with a combination of ground - based optical spectroscopy and _ hst _ wfc3/ir near - infrared grism spectroscopy delivering redshifts and emission - line strengths for over 300 galaxies ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "finally , the hudf lies in the centre of the _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdfs ) 4-ms x - ray imaging",
    "( xue et al . 2014 ) , and has recently been the focus of a new programme of ultra - deep radio imaging with the jvla ( pi : rujopakarn ) .",
    "the aim of the work presented here was to exploit this unique database by using alma to construct the deepest homogeneous mm - wavelength image obtained to date on the relevant scales .",
    "as described in detail in the next section , @xmath34hr of alma observations were approved in cycle 1 , and rolled over into cycle 2 , to enable us to complete a 1.3-mm mosaic covering the full 4.5arcmin@xmath1 imaged with wfc3/ir , seeking to reach an rms depth of @xmath35 ( pi : dunlop ) .",
    "we chose to undertake this first deep alma image of the hudf at 1.3 mm ( rather than at shorter wavelengths ) for three reasons .",
    "first , in practice it maximises sensitivity to higher redshift dusty star - forming galaxies at @xmath36 .",
    "second , it is at these longer wavelengths that the resolution of single dish surveys is undoubtedly poorest , and hence the imaging most confused .",
    "third , this decision aided the feasibility of the observations in early alma cycles , with only 45 pointings required to complete the mosaic , and both nightime and daytime observations being acceptable .",
    "astrophysically , we sought to reach detections 45 times deeper than can be achieved with the deepest single - dish surveys ( corresponding to star - formation rates @xmath37 out to the very highest redshifts ) , and to exploit the uniquely complete hudf galaxy database in deep stacking experiments .",
    "data taking for this project commenced in 2014 , and was completed in summer 2015 , and in this paper we present the first results .",
    "we present and discuss the properties of the alma map , the sources uncovered within it , and the implications for our understanding of cosmic star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the alma observations , explain how the data were reduced , and provide a summary of all the key multi - wavelength supporting data in the field . in section 3",
    "we explain how sources were extracted from the alma map , and then , in section 4 , describe how cross - identifications with the _ hst _ sources in the field enabled us to clean the source list to a final sample of 16 robust alma sources .",
    "in section 5 we consider the implications of the number of sources we have detected , aided by the results of source injection and retrieval simulations , and compare our results to other recent estimates of deep mm number counts . in section 6 we derive the physical properties of the sources we have detected , and explore the implications for star formation in galaxies at @xmath38 .",
    "then , in section 7 we present the results of stacking the 1.3-mm signal on the positions of known galaxy populations in the hudf , and consider the consequences for the mm - wavelength background and for the ratio of obscured / unobscured star formation over cosmic history .",
    "finally we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings in section 8 , and summarize our conclusions in section 9 . throughout",
    ", all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke 1974 ; oke & gunn 1983 ) , and all cosmological calculations assume a flat cold dark matter cosmology with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    ".summary of the alma observations of the hudf .",
    "the date of each execution block ( eb ) is given along with the approximate maximum baseline length and the average amount of precipitable water vapour ( pwv ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the galaxies revealed by our alma imaging have several interesting properties . first , as is clear from the colour ( @xmath42+@xmath43+@xmath44 ) postage - stamp images presented in fig.4 , the vast majority are noticeably red .",
    "indeed , certainly the @xmath45 alma sources can essentially be spotted by eye as the reddest objects in this particular colour representation of the hudf .",
    "second , because these objects are actually quite bright ( 15/16 have @xmath46mag ) , and because of the wealth of supporting spectroscopy and photometry in the hudf , we have complete , high - quality redshift information for essentially the whole sample ( see table2 , and associated caption ) .",
    "third , armed with this redshift information and multi - wavelength photometry ( e.g. see appendix a , fig.a1 ) we can derive relatively robust stellar masses and star - formation rates for these galaxies , as we now discuss ( see table4 ) .      as explained in section 2.2.5 , and tabulated in table2 , the wealth of deep spectroscopy in the hudf field results in 13 out of our 16 alma - detected galaxies having optical  near - infrared spectroscopic redshifts . to complete the redshift content of the sample , we estimated the redshifts of the remaining sources by adopting the median value from five alternative determinations of @xmath47 based on different sed fitting codes .",
    "the range of values returned by these codes , coupled with tests of @xmath47 v @xmath48 ( for the 13 sources in table2 with spectroscopic redshifts ) , indicates that the three photometric redshifts listed in table2 carry a typical rms uncertainty of @xmath49 .    the final redshift distribution of the alma - detected hudf galaxy sample is shown in fig.5 .",
    "although the present study probes an order - of - magnitude deeper ( in terms of dust - enshrouded sfr ) than the brighter sub - mm / mm selected samples produced by scuba , mambo , laboca , aztec , and scuba-2 over the last @xmath50 years , the redshift distribution of detected sources is very little changed .",
    "the mean redshift of the alma hudf sources is @xmath51 , with 13/16 sources ( @xmath52% ) in the redshift range @xmath53 .",
    "this is very similar to the redshift distribution displayed by , for example , the much brighter aztec sources uncovered in the shades fields , which have a median redshift of @xmath54 , with @xmath55% of sources lying in the redshift range @xmath56 ( michaowski et al .",
    "2012a ; see also , e.g. , chapman et al . 2005 ; aretxaga et al .",
    "2007 ; chapin et al . 2009 ) , although there is some evidence that the most extreme sources are confined to somewhat higher redshifts ( e.g. ivison et al . 2007 ; smolcic et al . 2012 ; koprowski et al . 2014 ; michaowski et al . 2016 ) .",
    "in fig.6 we plot the galaxies in the hudf on the @xmath57-redshift plane , highlighting the locations of the alma - detected galaxies .",
    "this shows that the alma - detected galaxies span a wide range of ( observed ) uv luminosities .",
    "however , a different picture emerges when stellar mass is plotted versus redshift , as shown in fig.7 . here",
    "it can be seen that essentially all of the alma - detected galaxies have high stellar masses .",
    "indeed , from fig.7 it can then be seen that the most obvious physical reason for the lack of very high redshift galaxies in our sample ( i.e. only one detection beyond @xmath58 ) is the absence of high - mass galaxies at these redshifts within the relatively small cosmological volumes sampled by the 4.5arcmin@xmath1 field .",
    "this is discussed further in the next subsection . by contrast , the decline in alma detections at @xmath59 is driven by the quenching of star - formation activity in high - mass galaxies , as is again evident from fig.7 .    )",
    "photometric redshifts , as listed in table2 . ]",
    "to derive the stellar masses of the galaxies , we fitted a range of single - component , and then also two - component bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) evolutionary synthesis models to the optical - infrared photometry of the sources ( at the redshifts listed in table2 ) .",
    "for the single - component models , the minimum age was set to 50myr , with @xmath60 allowed to vary from 300myr up to an essentially constant star - formation rate ( see wuyts et al .",
    "we applied reddening assuming the dust attenuation law of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with extinction allowed to vary up to @xmath61 ( see dunlop , cirasuolo & mclure 2007 ) , and the impact of igm absorption was modelled following madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "the derived galaxy masses , given in table4 , proved to be ( perhaps surprisingly ) robust to the range of star - formation histories which provided acceptable fits to the photometry ( possibly as a result of the high signal : noise of the available optical - infrared data in the hudf ) .",
    "the uncertainties in stellar mass given in table4 reflect the range in stellar masses delivered by acceptable star - formation histories .",
    "we assumed the imf of chabrier ( 2003 ) , and that the stellar masses given in table2 are @xmath8 ` total ' , which means the mass of living stars plus stellar remnants .",
    "one advantage of this choice is that the conversion from @xmath8 assuming chabrier ( 2003 ) to @xmath8 with a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf is relatively immune to age , involving multiplication by a factor @xmath62 .",
    "this @xmath8-total is typically @xmath63 dex larger than @xmath8-living , and @xmath64 dex smaller than @xmath65 , which includes recycled gas , although these conversions are functions of galaxy age and star - formation history .",
    "it can be seen that the stellar masses are high , with 13 out of the 16 sources having @xmath66 ( with the adopted chabrier imf ) .",
    "such objects are rare at these epochs in the relatively small volumes probed by the hudf .",
    "in particular , from fig.7 ( which shows mass versus redshift for all galaxies in the hudf ) , it can be seen that the hudf contains only 9 galaxies with @xmath67 at @xmath68 , and that our alma observations have detected 7 of them ( i.e. @xmath52% ) .",
    "this provides compelling evidence that stellar mass is the best predictor of star - formation rate at these epochs ( rather than , for example rest - frame uv luminosity ) , as expected from the ` main sequence ' of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. noeske et al .",
    "2007 ; daddi et al . 2007 ; elbaz et al . 2010 ; michaowski et al . 2012b ; roseboom et al . 2013 ; speagle et al . 2014 ; koprowski et al .",
    "2014 , 2016 ; renzini & peng 2015 ; schreiber et al .",
    "the location of our alma - detected galaxies relative to the ` main - sequence ' is discussed further below in section8.1 .    as is also apparent from fig.7 , at @xmath69 the fraction of high - mass ( @xmath67 ) galaxies that we detect with alma drops to 5/19 ( i.e. @xmath70% ) reflecting the emergence of a significant population of quenched high - mass galaxies over this redshift range .    at redshifts",
    "@xmath71 we have detected only one object , udf12 , which lies at @xmath72 . among our alma detections ,",
    "this is in fact the galaxy with the lowest estimated stellar mass , but from fig.7 it can be seen that it is one of the most massive galaxies in the hudf for its redshift ( i.e. it is one of the very few galaxies in this field at @xmath73 which has @xmath74 ) .",
    "we can therefore speculate that this detection may reflect a modest increase in typical specific star - formation rate between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( e.g. steinhardt et al .",
    "2014 ; marmol - queralto et al .",
    "2016 ) , combined with the sensitivity of 1.3-mm observations to extreme redshift dusty star - forming galaxies , and that moderately deeper sub - mm / mm observations of the field may yield significantly more detections at @xmath36 .      the completeness and quality of the redshift information , and the available high - quality multi - wavelength photometry allows us to derive various alternative estimates of star - formation rates ( sfr ) in the 16 alma - detected galaxies , which we present in table4 .",
    "first , we convert the rest - frame uv ( @xmath77 ) absolute magnitude , @xmath57 of each source into an estimate of the unobscured sfr . the adopted calibration means than an absolute magnitude of @xmath78 corresponds to a sfr of 1@xmath79 , consistent with the conversion given by kennicutt & evans ( 2012 ) .",
    "the resulting values are given in column 3 of table4 , and are unspectacular ( with sfr  @xmath80 for the majority of the sources ) .",
    "second , we use the sed fitting , as described above ( to derive the stellar masses ) , to estimate the extinction - corrected sfr from the uv  near - infrared sed . these estimates are given in column 5 of table4 , with the corresponding best - fitting values of @xmath81 given in column 4 ( extinction was allowed to range up to @xmath82mag . in the sed",
    "fitting , but the best - fitting values lie in the range 0.2 to 3.1mag . ) .",
    "third , we estimate dust - enshrouded sfr from the long - wavelength photometry , utilising the alma data , the deconfused _ herschel _ photometry , and testing the impact of including or excluding _ spitzer _",
    "24-@xmath27 m photometry . given the redshifts of the alma - detected galaxies , the key alma",
    "1.3-mm datapoint samples the rest - frame seds of the sources significantly longward of the peak of any feasible far - infrared sed .",
    "this is good for the estimation of robust dust masses , but means that the inferred sfr obviously depends on the form of the adopted far - infrared sed template .",
    "we therefore investigated the long - wavelength seds of the individually detected sources , and also amalgamated the 16-source photometry into a combined sed ( after de - redshifting and normalizing at @xmath83 mm ) which we show in fig.8 .",
    "this combined sed ( which , due to the accuracy of the available redshift information , displays the rest - frame 8-@xmath27 m feature ) can be used to establish the best template sed to use for the estimating of sfr for each source .",
    "the best - fitting model sed shown in fig.8 is the agn+star - forming composite model of kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and yields a best fit with a 20% agn contribution to bolometric @xmath84@xmath27 m infrared luminosity .",
    "we have therefore used this template to estimate the far - infrared luminosity of each of the alma sources , exploring the impact of both including and excluding the 24-@xmath27 m photometry to yield realistic uncertainties , and then converting to sfr using the conversion of murphy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) with a final minor scaling applied to convert from a kroupa to a chabrier imf .",
    "the resulting values are tabulated in column 6 of table4 , and are adopted hereafter as our best estimates of dust - enshrouded sfr .",
    "we note that , although this calculation has been performed using the composite template shown in fig.8 , and then reducing the far - infrared lumionosity by 20% to compensate for the typical agn contribution , in practice near identical values are obtained by simply fitting the star - forming component to the alma data - point .",
    "the star - forming component is essentially the sub - mm galaxy template of pope et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and at the redshifts of interest here ( @xmath75 ) produces a conversion between observed 1.3-mm flux density and sfr that can be approximated by sfr ( in @xmath85 @xmath86(in @xmath27jy ) . with this template , and",
    "adopting a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , the flux - density limit of the current survey thus corresponds to a limiting sfr sensitivity of @xmath87 .    for completeness",
    ", we also explored the impact of attempting to determine the best - fitting far - infrared sed template for each individual source , rather than adopting a single template for all sources .",
    "this approach makes more use of the deconfused _",
    "herschel _ photometry and limits , but the decision between alternative seds is inevitably rather uncertain on a source - by - source basis .",
    "we fitted each source with an m82 , arp220 , or sub - mm galaxy template ( silva et al .",
    "1998 ; michaowksi et al .",
    "2010 ) , and again explored the impact of including and excluding the 24@xmath27 m data .",
    "the results are given in column 7 of table4 ; we give the average of the derived sfr with and without including the 24@xmath27 m data , with the adopted error being the larger of the statistical error in the fitting or the range of results dictated by the impact of the 24@xmath27 m data .",
    "the most important information to be gleaned from these results is that the derived sfr is generally reassuringly similar to , or slightly lower than the values estimated from the single template ( shown in fig.8 ) as described above .",
    "the somewhat lower values for some sources simply reflect the fact that , when a source is better fit with the michaowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) sub - mm galaxy sed than either m82 or arp220 , the bolometric luminosity of the pope et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sub - mm galaxy template is @xmath88 larger than that of the michaowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) sub - mm template when normalized at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath89@xmath27 m ( when normalised at @xmath90@xmath27 m , the ratio is only @xmath91 ) .",
    "finally , we provide an estimate of sfr based on the new jvla 6ghz photometry of the alma sources ( table3 ) .",
    "given the potential for agn contamination at radio wavelengths , uncertainty in the precise radio - sfr calibration , and the need to adopt a consistent estimator for sfr for all 16 alma sources , we do not make further use of the radio - based estimates of sfr in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the the radio - inferred estimates of sfr given in column 8 of table4 provide reassurance that our far - infrared derived values are not seriously over - estimated .    in this context , we note from tables 3 and 4 that there appear to be two radio - loud agn in our sample , udf3 and udf7 .",
    "there are also two obvious x - ray agn , udf1 and udf8 . as listed in table3 , the catalogue produced by xue et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also yields detections of three more galaxies in our sample , but these detections are @xmath92 times fainter than the obvious x - ray agn , and , depending on the adopted extinction correction , may in fact be explained by the star formation activity in these galaxies ( although two of these weaker x - ray detections do correspond to the two radio - loud agn ) .     and the stellar mass range @xmath93 , ( excluding the sources already detected and listed in table4 ) .",
    "the image shown is 5.9 @xmath94 5.9 arcsec .",
    "the stacked ` source ' includes 89 galaxies , and has a mean flux density ( point - source + 25% ) of @xmath95 , corresponding to a mean sfr of @xmath96 .",
    "this means that galaxies in this mass and redshift range contribute a total dust - enshrouded sfr  @xmath97 .",
    "the same sources have an average uv luminosity corresponding to an absolute magnitude of @xmath98 , and hence contribute a total unobscured ( raw uv ) sfr @xmath99 .",
    "these results imply an average ratio of obscured : unobscured sfr of @xmath100 ( or total - sfr / unobscured - sfr @xmath101 ) , and a ssfr @xmath102gyr@xmath16 at a median mass of @xmath103 and median redshift @xmath104 . ]",
    "detection , typically corresponding to an average flux - density @xmath105mjy . at @xmath73",
    "the hudf contains no galaxies more massive than @xmath106 , and so the right - hand cell in the top row is genuinely blank .",
    "the cells below @xmath107 at @xmath108 may contain additional 1.3-mm flux density , but not at a level that could be securely detected via stacking in the current image . at @xmath109 and @xmath73",
    ", low sample size precludes bin subdivision by mass , and so we simply give the total flux detected via stacking of all sources in the @xmath109 and @xmath73 redshift bins .",
    "addition of all the numbers in this figure , combined with an estimated contribution of @xmath110mjy per hudf from sources brighter than @xmath111mjy ( equivalent to 0.8jy deg@xmath112 ) gives an estimate of @xmath113mjy for the 1.3-mm flux density in the hudf down to @xmath114mjy ( equivalent to @xmath115jydeg@xmath112 ; see fig.10 ) .",
    "of this total estimated background , @xmath116% is provided by sources with @xmath117 in the redshift range @xmath108 . within our background estimate , @xmath118% of the flux density",
    "is contributed by the 16 individually - detected sources in our alma image of the hudf , with only @xmath119% added by our attempts to extend flux retrieval down to @xmath120mjy sources through stacking . ]",
    "a key advantage of the hudf , not shared by many other deep alma pointings , is the quality , depth and completeness of the galaxy catalogue in the field .",
    "this enables stacking of chosen galaxy sub - populations within the alma image , allowing us to explore source properties to significantly fainter flux densities than achieved in the selection of robustly - detected individual sources .",
    "thus , not only can we attempt to derive an estimate of the total 1.3-mm flux - density present in the field , but to the extent allowed by population statistics , we can explore how this ( and hence dust - obscured star - formation activity ) is distributed as a function of redshift , galaxy stellar mass , and/or uv luminosity .",
    "we therefore explored stacking of galaxy sub - populations selected from a range of bins defined by redshift @xmath121 , stellar mass @xmath8 , and uv absolute magnitude @xmath122 .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , given the clear link between stellar mass and alma flux - density revealed by the location of the alma - detected sources in fig.7 , the most significant stack detections were achieved in the next mass bin , which we defined as @xmath123 .",
    "the 1.3-mm image stack of all galaxies in this mass range , and in the redshift range @xmath108 , is shown in fig.9 , and ( excluding the two detected galaxies in this bin ) produces a 4.4-@xmath32 detection , with a mean flux density ( point source @xmath124% ) @xmath95 ( corresponding to a mean sfr of @xmath96 ; reassuringly a stack of the galaxies in this same bin into the jvla 6-ghz image yielded a detection with mean flux density @xmath125 , corresponding to a mean sfr of @xmath126 ) .",
    "with 89 galaxies contributing to the stacked detection shown in fig.9 , the resulting inferred total 1.3-mm flux - density in this bin is @xmath127 .",
    "we subdivided this bin by redshift ( at @xmath128 ) , and proceeded in an analogous way to seek significant ( @xmath129  -  @xmath32 ) stacked 1.3-mm detections in other regions of the mass - redshift plane . in practice ,",
    "given the available number of galaxies , and the depth of the alma imaging , such detections correspond to bins that yield an average flux - density @xmath130 .",
    "in fig.10 we show the final result of this process , where , within each bin , we have also added back the contribution of the individually detected sources .",
    "the coverage of the redshift - mass plane is limited by the fact that i ) there are no galaxies in the hudf with @xmath131 to stack at @xmath73 ( see fig.7 ) ; ii ) no significant stacked detections were achieved in mass bins confined to @xmath132 , and iii ) the limited number of galaxies in the field at @xmath109 and @xmath73 prohibited significant stacked detections sub - divided by mass at these redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , given the evidence for the steep dependence of dust - obscured star formation on stellar mass explored further below , the sum of the figures given in fig.10 can be expected to yield a reasonably complete estimate of the 1.3-mm background , and we believe this represents the best estimate to date of the distribution of this background as a function of redshift and galaxy stellar mass .",
    "we note that , at @xmath133 , the numbers given in fig.10 can be reasonably converted into estimates of total dust - enshrouded sfr per bin , by multiplying by @xmath134 ( see section 6.3 ) . however , at @xmath109 , this will yield a serious over - estimate of sfr , because of the lack of a negative k - correction in this regime ( i.e. a significant amount of the flux density in the @xmath109 bin is contributed by relatively low - redshift , but intrinsically not very luminous sources ) . for this reason , and because at @xmath135 , observations at 1.3-mm sample the far - infrared seds of the sources rather far from the peak of emission , we do not use our stacked results at @xmath109 in the discussion of star - formation rates in the remainder of this paper .",
    "however , the contribution of sources at @xmath109 is still of interest when considering the implications for faint source counts , and the 1.3-mm background .        in fig.11 we explore our resulting estimate of integrated flux density at @xmath136 mm , as a function of source flux - density , utilising our detections down to @xmath137 , and the contribution produced by the sum of stacked fluxes ( excluding the individual source contributions from fig.10 ) reaching down to @xmath138 .",
    "the left - hand panel of fig.11 shows results per hudf ( i.e. per 4.5arcmin@xmath1 ) in linear units , while the right - hand panel shows the more standard logarithmic representation in units of jydeg@xmath112 .",
    "the solid black line in each plot shows simply the running sum of the flux densities of the 16 alma hudf sources , starting at the total contributed by sources brighter that @xmath139mjy ( i.e. @xmath140jydeg@xmath112 ; scott et al .",
    "2012 ) down to our ( effective ) detection threshold of @xmath141mjy .",
    "below this flux - density we extrapolate the line down to @xmath138 to account for the contribution estimated from our stacking analysis , ( which adds an additional @xmath142mjy / hudf ) .",
    "our hudf - derived estimate of total flux density can be seen to be ( just ) consistent with the 1-@xmath32 lower bound on the estimated background as measured by cobe ( i.e. 17@xmath143jydeg@xmath112 ; puget et al .",
    "1996 ; fixsen et al .",
    "our results can be plausibly reconciled with those of hatsukade et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , but to achieve the much higher estimated backgrounds reported by fujimoto et al .",
    "( 2016 ) or carniani et al .",
    "( 2015 ) down to @xmath144mjy we would require to approximately double the flux - density we have actually been able to uncover in the hudf through source detection and stacking .",
    "armed with the physical knowledge of the properties of the individual alma - detected galaxies ( table4 ) , the stacking results discussed in the previous section , and our knowledge of the redshifts , rest - frame uv luminosities and stellar masses of all galaxies in the hudf , we now investigate the implications for the relationship between star formation and stellar mass at @xmath75 .",
    "we confine our attention to the 13 alma - detected sources with @xmath145 , derive the average properties of this sample , and consider also the average results from stacking in the same redshift range within the two stellar mass bins defined by @xmath123 and @xmath146 .",
    "the median redshift of the detected sample is @xmath147 , while for the two stacks the median redshifts are @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the corresponding median stellar masses are @xmath150 , 9.63 and 8.62 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.12 .",
    "this shows ( as solid red circles ) the positions on the sfr@xmath8 plane of the 13 alma - detected sources , with associated uncertainties ( see table4 ) , with the average ( median ) values of total ( fir+uv ) sfr plotted for the three mass bins as solid black squares ( with standard errors ) . for the lowest of the stellar mass bins ,",
    "no detection was achieved in the alma stack of the 391 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath145 , and so we plot an upper limit derived from the rms of @xmath151 achieved in this stack ( corresponding to a 1-@xmath32 limit on average obscured sfr @xmath152 , and hence a limit of total sfr @xmath153 ) .",
    "the solid black line in fig.12 shows a simple relation of the form sfr  @xmath154 , with ssfr=2.2gyr@xmath16 .",
    "this is clearly an excellent fit to our data . also shown",
    "is the original ` main - sequence ' ( ms ) of star - forming galaxies at @xmath75 derived by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( sfr  @xmath155 , adjusted in mass normalization to account for the change from salpeter imf to chabrier imf ) , the shallower @xmath75 ms presented by whitaker et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( sfr  @xmath156 ) , the revised steeper polynomial form presented by whitaker et al . ( 2014 ) , and the result of the meta analysis undertaken by speagle et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ( calculated at @xmath75 ) .",
    "all of these ( and many more ) published relations are perfectly consistent with our data at @xmath157 , proving beyond doubt that the alma - detected galaxies lie on the ms at @xmath75 . however , over the dynamic range probed here , none fit any better than ( or indeed as well as ) the simply constant ssfr relation plotted in black ( although both the original daddi et al . and the revised whitaker et al .",
    "relations are also clearly acceptable ) .",
    "in fig.12 we also plot the corresponding results for the raw uv sfr for the individual sources ( cyan triangles ) , and median values in each stellar mass bin ( open navy - blue squares ) .",
    "finally , in each mass bin we also plot the median values of dust - corrected uv sfr derived from the optical  near - infrared sed fitting ( open green squares ) , as would be obtained in the absence of any direct mm / far - ir information ( i.e. based on the values given in column 5 of table4 , and analogous results for all galaxies in the two lower - mass bins ) . in the two lower - mass bins the positions of these green points are reassuringly close to the black points , indicating that dust - corrected sfr from optical  near - infrared sed fitting works well for moderately - obscured lower mass galaxies , and also confirming that the steepness of the ms at low masses is not an artefact of the alma stacking procedure .",
    "however , in the highest mass bin , the sed - estimated median sfr falls short of the true alma - derived values by a factor @xmath158 .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the ratio of median total sfr to median raw uv - estimated sfr at @xmath150 can be seen to be @xmath134 .",
    "the alma - derived results argue against any flattening of the ms , at least up to stellar masses @xmath159 ( provided quenched galaxies are excluded , although the lack of quenched high - mass galaxies in the field makes this distinction academic at @xmath160 ) .    .",
    "the individual ratios for the 13 alma - detected sources at @xmath161 are indicated by the red points , and the median value at @xmath162 is @xmath163 ( see column 9 in table4 ) .",
    "the black squares indicate the ratios for each of our three mass bins , summing all sfr ( detected - fir + stacked - fir + total - uv ) in each bin , and dividing by all the raw uv sfr in that mass bin .",
    "the stacked ( true total ratio ) value at median mass @xmath164 is @xmath165 ( significantly lower than the median ratio of alma - detected sources ) .",
    "the average ratio at @xmath166 is @xmath167 , while at @xmath168 our analysis yields a limit on this ratio of @xmath169 ( see section 8.2 ) . ]",
    "the results discussed in the previous sub - section , and presented in fig.12 , clearly imply a strong mass dependence for the ratio of obscured to unobscured star formation .",
    "we explore this explicitly , again focussing on @xmath75 ( i.e. @xmath170 ) , in fig.13 . here",
    "we plot the ratio of total sfr ( i.e. uv+fir ) to uv - visible sfr as a function of mass .",
    "again we plot the individual ratios for the 13 alma detected sources ( see column 9 in table4 ) , and we also plot the ratios for each of our three mass bins ( for the lowest mass bin , an upper limit , as in fig.12 ) , summing all sfr ( detected - fir + stacked - fir + total - uv ) in each mass bin , and dividing by all the raw uv sfr in that bin .    it can be seen that the median value of this ratio for the detected sources is 152 , or in fact 218 if the two detected galaxies in this redshift range with @xmath171 are disregarded ( for consistency with the high mass bin for which @xmath172 ) . however , the stacked ( true total ratio ) value at median mass @xmath164 is significantly lower , at @xmath165 .",
    "the average ratio at @xmath166 is @xmath167 , while at @xmath168 our analysis yields @xmath169 .",
    "clearly , the ratio of total sfr to uv - visible sfr is a very steep function of mass above @xmath173 ; over the next decade in mass , this ratio also increases by a factor @xmath174 , indicating that essentially all the increase in sfr with stellar mass on the main sequence at higher masses is delivered in a dust - obscured form .",
    "this clarifies why sub - mm observations are so effective at detecting high - mass galaxies at @xmath175 .",
    "because the galaxies lie on the star - forming main sequence , a galaxy with @xmath164 will have ten times the intrinsic sfr of a galaxy of stellar - mass @xmath176 , _ and _ the obscured : unobscured ratio is also typically ten times greater .",
    "finally , we use our new alma results , combined with our existing knowledge of the rest - frame uv properties of the galaxies in the hudf , to explore the evolution of cosmic star - formation rate density , @xmath177 . in fig.14",
    "we plot the dust - obscured values of @xmath178 in unit redshift bins from @xmath179 to @xmath180 , combining our alma detections ( table.4 ) and the results of the stacking summarized in section 7 .",
    "in essence , these results ( indicated by the red data - points in both panels of fig.14 ) are the result of collapsing the 1.3-mm flux distribution shown in fig.10 along the stellar - mass axis , converting to @xmath177(obscured ) using the sed plotted in fig.8 ( see section 6.3 ) and dividing by the comoving cosmological volume sampled by the 4.5arcmin@xmath1 of the hudf in each redshift bin .",
    "this thus represents a direct sum of the observed dust - obscured star - formation activity in the field , and does not rely on , for example , assumptions regarding the poorly constrained faint - end slope of the far - infrared luminosity function at these redshifts .    in a similar manner , we have summed up all the individual values of raw uv sfr for all the @xmath181 galaxies uncovered through the _ hst _ imaging of the hudf , to construct the evolution of @xmath177(visible ) over the same redshift range ( indicated by the solid blue points in both panels of fig.14 ) .",
    "these two values are then simply added to produce an estimate of @xmath177(total ) , which is plotted as the black points in the left - hand panel of fig.14 , and compared with two recently published parametric fits to the evolution of @xmath177 as derived from reviews of the existing literature results ( behroozi , wechsler & conroy 2013 ; madau & dickinson 2014 ) .    from the left - hand panel of fig.14 it can be seen that the results of this simple calculation are remarkably consistent with the published curves at @xmath182 ( which , where required , have been scaled to the chabrier imf ) , but our derived value appears somewhat low at @xmath183 .",
    "however , by these redshifts the census of uv sfr produced by this simple summing of galaxy contributions is inevitably incomplete at the faint end , with the median value of @xmath184 changing from @xmath3016.8 at @xmath185 to @xmath3018.1 at @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , to enable a proper and consistent accounting of the uv contribution , we integrated the evolving galaxy uv luminosity function ( weighted by uv luminosity ) down to a consistent luminosity limit corresponding to @xmath186 .",
    "to do this we used the latest uv luminosity functions produced by parsa et al .",
    "( 2016 ) and bouwens et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and the results are shown by the open blue squares in the right - hand panel of fig.14 , where they are also then added to the ( unchanged ) values of @xmath177(visible ) to produce a revised estimate for @xmath177(total ) .",
    "reassuringly , it can be seen that the two alternative values of @xmath177(visible ) are indistinguishable at @xmath185 , where the hudf data are deep enough to sample the uv luminosity function to @xmath187 ( parsa et al .",
    "however , at @xmath109 the hudf is too small to properly reflect the contribution made to uv luminosity density by the brighter galaxies , while at @xmath160 the direct census becomes increasingly incomplete , and the integration of the uv luminosity function yields a systematically increasing upward correction .    at @xmath182",
    "the overwhelming dominance of dust - obscured star formation means that completing the uv census in this way makes little impact on the estimated value of @xmath177(total ) .",
    "however , at @xmath36 the impact is more pronounced , and by @xmath188 the effect is dramatic enough to result in @xmath177(visible ) being larger than @xmath177(obscured ) , and @xmath177(total ) being lifted up to values that are consistently higher than predicted by the madau & dickinson ( 2014 ) fit , but in excellent agreement with ( at least the high - redshift end of ) the parametric fit obtained by behroozi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "we stress that this is the first time a direct census of @xmath177(obscured ) has been performed at these redshifts , and that the integration of the uv lf has not always been performed to a consistently deep luminosity limit at all redshifts .",
    "it is therefore reassuring to see such good agreement with the results of existing literature reviews , but also interesting to note how the balance of power shifts from unobscured to obscured star formation with cosmic time .",
    "it appears that , at redshift @xmath73 , most of the star formation in the universe is unobscured , and relatively modest corrections are therefore required to infer @xmath177(total ) from rest - frame uv observations .",
    "by contrast , at @xmath189 the obscured mode of star formation becomes increasingly dominant until it is primarily responsible for producing the peak in @xmath177(total ) at @xmath190 .",
    "both behroozi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and madau & dickinson ( 2014 ) favoured a peak in @xmath177(total ) at @xmath191 , and it may be the case that the very brightest sub - mm sources not sampled by the small volume of the hudf contribute sufficiently around this redshift to both boost @xmath177 by a few percent , and perhaps shift the peak to slightly lower redshifts . however , recent studies utilising _ herschel _ and scuba-2 data to probe the dust - obscured contribution out to @xmath192 also appear to favour a peak redshift in the range @xmath193 ( e.g. burgarella et al . 2013 ; bourne et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "while the average metallicity of the universe must obviously increase with cosmic time , the apparent transition at @xmath194 from predominantly visible star formation at higher redshifts , to primarily dust - obscured star formation at @xmath189 is not necessarily driven by an increase in the prevalence of dust in galaxies of a given mass .",
    "rather it appears to be largely due to the rapid growth in the number density of the high - mass galaxies that contain most of the dust - obscured star formation at @xmath195 ( see fig.7 and fig.13 ) ; indeed there is at most only weak evidence for any evolution in the ratio of obscured : unobscured sfr with redshift for galaxies selected at constant stellar mass @xmath8 ( bourne et al .",
    "as is clear from fig.7 , deeper sub - mm imaging with alma has the potential to resolve this issue , by charting the evolution of dust - obscured star - formation activity at constant stellar mass from @xmath196 to the present day .",
    "we have constructed the first deep , contiguous and homogeneous alma image of the hubble ultra deep field , using a mosaic of 45 alma pointings at @xmath136 mm to map the full @xmath197arcmin@xmath1 area previously imaged with wfc3/ir on the _ hst_. the resulting image reaches an rms sensitivity @xmath198@xmath3 , at a resolution of @xmath199arcsec .",
    "a search for sources in this image yielded an initial list of @xmath200 @xmath201 peaks , but an analogous analysis of the negative image showed that , as expected from the size and noise level of the map , @xmath202 of these peaks were likely to be spurious .",
    "we then exploited the unparalled optical / near - infrared data in the field to isolate the real sources , via the identification of robust galaxy counterparts within a search radius of @xmath203arcsec ( in the process uncovering the need for a @xmath204arcsec shift in the _ hst _ co - ordinate system ) .",
    "the result is a final sample of 16 alma sources with point - source flux densities @xmath205@xmath3 .",
    "the brightest three of these sources were clearly resolved , and so we measured their total flux densities from image fitting .",
    "for the fainter sources we estimated total flux densities by applying a 25% boost to their point - source flux densities ( a correction based on a stack of the brightest five sources ) .",
    "all of the alma sources have secure galaxy counterparts with accurate redshifts ( 13 spectroscopic , 3 photometric ) , yielding a mean redshift @xmath51 . within our sample ,",
    "12 galaxies are also detected at 6ghz in new ultra - deep jvla imaging . due to the wealth of supporting data in this unique field ,",
    "the physical properties of the alma - detected galaxies are well constrained , including their stellar masses and uv - visible star - formation rates . to estimate the dust - obscured star - formation rates for the sources , we established a template far - infrared sed by fitting their combined alma and ( deconfused ) _",
    "spitzer_+_herschel _ photometry .",
    "our results confirm previous indications that stellar mass is the best predictor of star formation rate in the high - redshift universe , with our alma sample containing 7 of the 9 galaxies in the hudf with @xmath10 at @xmath68 .",
    "we detect only one galaxy at @xmath71 , and show that the lack of high - redshift detections simply reflects the rapid drop - off of high - mass galaxies in the field at @xmath36 .",
    "the detected sources , coupled with results of stacking in bins of redshift and mass , allow us to probe the redshift / mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to @xmath138 , and we find that our estimate of the total 1.3-mm background provided by detected and stacked sources is ( just ) consistent with the background measurement made by cobe .",
    "we find strong evidence for a steep ` main sequence ' for star - forming galaxies at @xmath75 , with sfr @xmath206 and a mean specific sfr @xmath207gyr@xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath208% of total star formation at @xmath38 is enshrouded in dust , with @xmath209% of all star formation at this epoch occurring in high - mass galaxies ( @xmath67 ) , for which the average obscured : unobscured sf ratio is @xmath163 . averaged over cosmic volume we find that , at @xmath75 , the ratio of obscured to unobscured star - formation activity rises roughly proportional to stellar mass , from a factor @xmath210 at @xmath211 , to a factor @xmath200 at @xmath212 .",
    "finally , we combine our new alma results with the existing _ hst _ data to attempt a complete census of obscured and visible star formation in the field , and hence revisit the cosmic evolution of star - formation rate density ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "we find reassuringly good agreement with recent estimates of the evolution of @xmath178 with redshift , and our results indicate that , while most star formation in the young universe is visible at rest - frame uv wavelengths , dust - obscured star formation becomes dominant at @xmath189 , due primarily to the rise in the number density of high - mass star - forming galaxies .",

    "<S> our results show that stellar mass is the best predictor of sfr in the high - redshift universe ; indeed at @xmath9 our alma sample contains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the hudf with @xmath10 , and we detect only one galaxy at @xmath11 , reflecting the rapid drop - off of high - mass galaxies with increasing redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the detections , coupled with stacking , allow us to probe the redshift / mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to @xmath12 . </S>",
