    "in this paper we investigate the different dynamical regimes in a fokker - planck equation with multiple scales that was introduced in @xcite to describe the charging and discharging of lithium - ion batteries , a process that exhibits pronounced hysteretic effects @xcite .",
    "the model , to which we refer as ( fp ) , governs the evolution of a statistical ensemble of identical particles and is given by the nonlocal fokker - plank equation @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the free energy of a single particle with thermodynamic state @xmath2 , the probability density @xmath3 describes the state of the whole system at time @xmath4 , and @xmath5 reflects that the system is subjected to some external forcing .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 is the typical relaxation time of a single particle and @xmath7 accounts for entropic effects ( stochastic fluctuations ) .",
    "the model ( fp ) has two crucial features which cause highly nontrivial dynamics .",
    "first , the free energy @xmath1 is a double - well potential , hence there exist two different stable equilibria for each particle .",
    "second , the system is not driven directly but via a time - dependent control parameter . in our case",
    "this parameter is the first moment of @xmath8 , that means we impose the dynamical constraint @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some given function in time , and a direct calculation shows that is equivalent to @xmath11 provided that the initial data satisfy @xmath12 .",
    "the closure relation implies that is a nonlocal and nonlinear pde .",
    "well - posedness was proven in @xcite on bounded domains , but we are not aware of any result about the qualitative properties of solutions .",
    "an intriguing property of ( fp ) is that its dynamics involves three different time scales . on the one hand , there are the relaxation time @xmath13 and the time scale of the dynamical constraint . on the other hand",
    "there is the scale of probabilistic transitions between different local minima of the effective energy @xmath14 , that means particles can move between the different wells due to stochastic fluctuations ( large deviations ) .",
    "kramers studied such transitions in the context of chemical reactions @xcite and derived the characteristic time scale @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the minimal difference of energy between the local maximum any of the local minima of @xmath17 . in what follows",
    "we always assume that @xmath18 is of order @xmath19 , whereas both @xmath13 and @xmath20 are supposed to be small .    our goal in this paper is to identify different parameter regimes and to describe the asymptotics of ( fp ) in the limit @xmath21 . to this end",
    "we focus on strictly increasing constraints and describe four different mechanisms of mass transfer between two stable regions .",
    "the corresponding four types of phase transitions are , roughly speaking , related to two main regimes , which we refer to as _ fast reaction regime _ and _ slow reaction region _ , respectively .",
    "the dominant effect in the fast reaction regime is mass exchange according to kramers formula .",
    "this appears for very small @xmath13 and covers , as limiting case , also the quasi - stationary regime @xmath22 .",
    "the slow reaction regime , however , corresponds to very small @xmath20 and kramers formula is not relevant anymore .",
    "instead , phase transitions are dominated by transport along characteristics and this causes rather complicated dynamics since localized peaks of mass can enter the spinodal region of @xmath1 .    in both the slow reaction and the fast reaction regimes we are able to characterize the small parameter dynamics in terms of a few averaged quantities only .",
    "detailed descriptions of the corresponding limit models are given in the introductions to sections [ sec : fast ] and [ sec : slow ] , respectively .",
    "before we give a more detailed overview on the different dynamical regimes we specify our assumptions on @xmath1 and review some basic facts about fokker - planck equations .",
    "in this paper we assume that @xmath1 is an even double - well potential that satisfies the following conditions , see figure [ fig : potential ] ,    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is even , sufficiently smooth ( at least @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 grows at least linearly as @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   there exist constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that 1 .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 , 2 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , 3 .",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "+ in particular , the inverse of @xmath36 has the three strictly monotone branches @xmath37}\\to { ( -\\infty,\\,-x_*]}\\,,\\quad x_0:{[-{{\\sigma}}_*,\\,{{\\sigma}}_*]}\\to{[-x_*,\\,x_*]}\\,,\\quad x_-:{[-{{\\sigma}}_*,\\,\\infty)}\\to { [ x_*,\\,\\infty)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 3",
    ".   the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are concave on the spinodal interval @xmath40 .",
    "the assumptions in ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) are made for convenience and might be weakened for the price of further technical and notational efforts ; ( a3 ) is a geometric condition that becomes important in the slow reaction regime that is discussed in section  [ sec : slow ] .",
    "notice that all assumptions are in particular satisfied for the standard double - well potential @xmath41    in what follows we refer to @xmath42 and @xmath43 as the stable intervals , whereas the spinodal region @xmath40 is called the unstable interval .",
    "this nomenclature is motivated by the different properties of the transport term in . in both stable intervals",
    "adjacent characteristics approach each other exponentially fast , hence there is a strong tendency to concentrate mass into narrow peaks . in the unstable region",
    ", however , the separation of adjacent characteristics delocalizes any peak with positive width .",
    "fokker - plank equations like ( fp ) are derived in @xcite from first principles and provide a thermodynamically consistent model for a many - particle system with dynamical constraint . in particular , the second law of thermodynamics can be stated as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the free energy of the system and @xmath46 the dissipation .",
    "they are given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denote the internal energy and entropy of the many - particle system , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the fokker - planck equation without constraint , that is with @xmath50 , admits several interpretations as a gradient flow .",
    "there is for instance a linear structure , which has been exploited in @xcite in order to derive the effective dynamics in the limit @xmath51 .",
    "of particular interest , however , is the nonlinear wasserstein gradient flow structure , see @xcite , as this structure is compatible with the constraint .",
    "more precisely , ( fp ) with @xmath52 is the wasserstein gradient flow for @xmath45 on the constraint manifold @xmath53 , and @xmath54 describes a drift transversal to this manifold .",
    "the entropic term @xmath20 is often supposed to be very small but it is important that @xmath20 is positive .",
    "more precisely , without the diffusive term the qualitative properties of solutions would strongly depend on microscopic details of the initial data , and hence it would be impossible to characterize the limit @xmath55 in terms of macroscopic , i.e. averaged , quantities only , see @xcite .",
    "a key observation is that the singular perturbation @xmath56 regularizes the macroscopic evolution , at least for some classes of initial data , in the following sense .",
    "microscopic small - scale effects are still relevant on the macroscopic scale , but they are independent of the initial details and affect the system in a well - defined manner . as a consequence",
    "we now obtain a well - posed limit model for macroscopic quantities .",
    "another approach to ensure well - defined macroscopic behavior is investigated in @xcite .",
    "the key idea there is to mimic entropic effects by assuming that each particle is affected by a slightly perturbed potential .",
    "the macroscopic evolution is then completely determined by the dynamical constraint , the macroscopic initial data , and the probability distribution of the perturbations .",
    "we next summarize some facts about the dynamics of with time - independent @xmath5 and small parameters @xmath57 . for @xmath58}$ ] , the effective potential @xmath14 possesses a single critical point @xmath59 that corresponds to a global minimum .",
    "the system then relaxes very fast ( on the time scale @xmath13 ) to its unique equilibrium state @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a normalization constant ensuring @xmath62 . this equilibrium density",
    "@xmath63 has a single peak of width @xmath20 located at @xmath59 and decays exponentially as @xmath64 .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath65 since @xmath17 now exhibits a double well - structure with two wells ( local minima ) at @xmath66 that are separated by a barrier ( local maximum ) at @xmath67 .",
    "initially the system relaxes very quickly , and approaches ( for smooth initial data ) a state composed of two narrow peaks located at the wells .",
    "both peaks have masses @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 , but the precise values of @xmath71 depend strongly on the initial data .",
    "this fast transition reflects that each particle in the system is strongly attracted by the nearest well due to the gradient flow structure .",
    "the resulting state , however , is in general not an equilibrium but only a metastable state .",
    "the underlying physical argument is that particles can pass the energy barrier due to stochastic fluctuations . in the generic case ,",
    "in which both wells have different energies , it is of course more likely for a particle to cross the barrier coming from the well with higher energy , and thus there is a net flux of mass towards the well with lower energy .",
    "this flux is , for small @xmath72 , given by kramers celebrated formula and guarantees that the system approaches its equilibrium on the slow time scale .",
    "the corresponding equilibrium solution is again given by and has now two peaks with a definite mass distribution between the wells .",
    "notice , however , that for small @xmath20 almost all the mass of an equilibrium solution is confined to the well with lower energy .",
    "due to the different time scales , the dynamics of ( fp ) can be very complicated , and we are far from being able to characterize the small parameter dynamics for all types of initial data and all reasonable dynamical constraints .",
    "we thus restrict most of our considerations to strictly increasing dynamical constraints and well - prepared initial ; only in section [ sect:332 ] we allow for non - monotone constraints .      in what follows we consider functions @xmath10 with @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75",
    "are given constants .",
    "since @xmath13 is small , the system then relaxes very quickly to a local equilibrium state with @xmath76 .",
    "we can therefore assume that the initial mass is concentrated in a narrow peak , that means @xmath77 where the right hand side abbreviates the dirac distribution at @xmath78 .",
    "an even better approximation , that also accounts for the small entropic effects caused by @xmath79 , is @xmath80 the dynamical constraint implies @xmath81 , so that the peak starts moving to the right and the system quickly relaxes to a new local equilibrium state . for sufficiently small times , that means as long as @xmath82 , the system can therefore be described by the _ single peak model _",
    "@xmath83 where we write @xmath84 and @xmath85 to indicate that all mass is confined in the left stable interval @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , at some time @xmath86 we have @xmath87 , and for @xmath88 the system again relaxes quickly to a local equilibrium state , that means we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 now reflect that all mass has been transferred to the second stable region @xmath43 .    the key question is what happens between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it was already observed in @xcite that , depending on the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath20 , there are at least four types of phase transitions driven by rather different mechanisms of mass transfer from the left stable region into the right one .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to investigate the different regimes and to derive asymptotic formulas for the dynamics .",
    "we illustrate the different types of phase transitions for the driven initial value problem and by numerical simulations with @xmath94 and initial data @xmath95 as in .",
    "figure [ fig : ivp1 ] visualizes the numerical solutions by means of two curves @xmath96 these curves represent the _ macroscopic state _ of the system and the ( rescaled ) _ phase field _ , respectively , and are defined by @xmath97 the microscopic state of the system is illustrated in figure [ fig : ivp2 ] by snapshots of @xmath8 at different times .",
    "we emphasize that figures [ fig : ivp1 ] and [ fig : ivp2 ] also illustrate the different dynamical regimes for fixed @xmath79 , in the sense that the limit @xmath98 can be regarded as a passage from ( @xmath99 ) to ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , as our results will show , there is an exponential scale separation between the different regimes and thus it is very hard to capture all types of phase transitions in numerical simulations with the same value of @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical simulations illustrate that there exist the following types of phase transitions .",
    "@xmath101    at some time the narrow peak enters the unstable region due to the dynamical constraint and starts to widen due to the separation of characteristics .",
    "however , the transport is much faster than the widening , so that the peak can pass trough the unstable region .",
    "the peak still enters the unstable region but now the widening is much faster than before . in particular , the unstable peak delocalizes , and the system quickly forms new peaks in each of the stable regions . at a later time",
    "the left peak enters the unstable region , and the competition between transport and widening starts once more .",
    "the peak does not enter the unstable region anymore .",
    "instead , at some position in the left stable interval the peak stops moving and starts loosing mass to feed another peak in the right stable interval .",
    "this kramers - type process happens with @xmath102 and goes on until the left peak has disappeared .",
    "this is the quasi - stationary limit .",
    "the phase transition is similar to type iii but happens with @xmath103 .",
    "notice that the types @xmath104 and @xmath105 imply hysteresis .",
    "in fact , if we revert the situation by driving the system with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the symmetry of the problem implies that the macroscopic state and the phase field are confined to the images of @xmath108 and @xmath109 under point reflections at @xmath110 .",
    "our main results are formulas for the macroscopic evolution in different parameter regimes .",
    "the corresponding scaling relations between @xmath13 and @xmath20 are summarized in table [ tbl : scalingregimes ] and the limit models are presented in the introductions to sections [ sec : fast ] and [ sec : slow ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : fast ] we derive asymptotic formulas to describe type-@xmath105 transitions in the regime @xmath111 , where @xmath112 denotes the energy barrier of @xmath1 .",
    "we first recall in section  [ sec : kramers.1 ] the formal derivation of kramers formula for the mass flux between the different wells of @xmath17 . in section  [ sec : kramers.2 ] we then identify the critical value for @xmath113 for which such a mass flux can also take place in the constrained setting and show in section  [ sec : kramers.3 ] that small variations in @xmath5 are sufficient to adjust the mass flux according to the dynamical constraint .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : kramers.4 ] we discuss type-@xmath114 transitions as these can be regarded as limits of kramers type transitions .    in section  [ sec :",
    "slow ] we consider the scaling regime @xmath115 with @xmath116 and discuss type-@xmath104 transitions which contain , as a special case , also type-@xmath100 transitions . in section  [ sect:31 ]",
    "we first neglect all entropic effects and introduce a simplified two - peaks model that allows to understand how two dirac peaks interact due to the dynamical constraint .",
    "it turns out that the dynamical constraint can stabilize a peak in the unstable region , but also that at some point a bifurcation forces both peaks to merge instantaneously . in section  [ sect:32 ]",
    "we introduce another simplified model that accounts for the stochastic fluctuations in the unstable region and allows to understand how an unstable peak delocalizes and splits into two stable peaks .",
    "in particular , we derive an asymptotic formula for the time at which such a splitting event takes place and introduce the _ mass splitting problem _ that determines the mass distribution between the emerging peaks . in section  [ sect:33 ]",
    "we finally combine all result and characterize the limit dynamics as intervals of regular transport that are interrupted by several types of singular event .",
    "in this section we show that kramers type phase transitions are also relevant in presence of the dynamical constraint as long as @xmath117 where @xmath118 denotes the energy barrier of @xmath1 .",
    "the key idea is that a kramers type phase transition occurs during a time interval @xmath119 in which @xmath5 is positive and almost constant . during this time interval",
    "@xmath120 only changes to order @xmath121 but this is sufficient to accommodate the dynamical constraint .",
    "kramers formula therefore allows to understand phase transitions of type iii , and hence that a stable peak suddenly stops moving and starts loosing mass to feed a second stable peak .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath122 since then we expect to find phase transitions of type iv , that means the mass flows towards the second well as soon as it is energetically admissible .",
    "this regime is governed by the quasi - stationary approximation but can also be regarded as a limiting case of kramers regime .    our main result concerning the fast reaction regime combines the formal asymptotics for the kramers regime and the quasi - stationary approximation and can be stated as follows .",
    "suppose that the dynamical constraint and the initial data satisfy and , and that @xmath13 and @xmath20 are coupled by @xmath123 for some constant @xmath124 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath125 such that    1 .",
    "the dynamical multiplier satisfies @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are uniquely determined by @xmath129 and @xmath130 , 2 .",
    "the state of the system satisfies @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133    moreover , the assertions remain true    1 .   with @xmath134 if @xmath135 , 2 .   with @xmath136",
    "if @xmath137 but @xmath138 for all @xmath139 .    to justify the limit dynamics we review kramers argument for constant @xmath120 in section [ sec : kramers.1 ] . in section [ sec : kramers.2 ]",
    "we then derive similar asymptotic formulas for the constrained case , which allow us to adjust the mass flux according to the dynamical constraints in section [ sec : kramers.3 ] .",
    "moreover , in section [ sec : kramers.4 ] we discuss the quasi - steady approximation , which governs the regime @xmath140 .",
    "we finally mention that the limit energy is given by @xmath141 and evolves according to @xmath142 where @xmath17 is defined by @xmath143 and @xmath144 denotes the usual characteristic function .      to derive kramers formula for the unconstrained case we consider the fokker - planck equation with fixed @xmath145 and use the abbreviations @xmath146    at first we approximate @xmath8 outside the local maximum @xmath67 for small @xmath20 by the ansatz @xmath147 this is the outer expansion and reflects the assumption that the system has a peak in either of the stable regions , where the masses are given by @xmath148 for small @xmath20 we can simplify the integrals using laplace s method , that means we expand @xmath17 around @xmath149 to find @xmath150 the mass exchange between both peaks",
    "is then determined by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the mass flux at @xmath153 .",
    "the key idea behind kramers formula is that @xmath152 can be computed from the quasi - stationary approximation of @xmath8 near @xmath153 .",
    "more precisely , with the change of variables @xmath154 we approximate @xmath155 and obtain the inner expansion @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a constant of integration . for small @xmath20 and @xmath158 we can simplify the integrals by laplace s method to obtain @xmath159 and using a similar formula for @xmath160",
    "we find @xmath161 in order to match the outer and the inner expansions , we consider @xmath162 and compare the asymptotic formulas and . since both contain the factor @xmath163 , we equate the time dependent coefficients and arrive at the matching conditions @xmath164 we finally eliminate @xmath157 and find the desired expression for kramers mass flux , namely @xmath165 combining this with we easily verify that the characteristic time for kramers mass transfer is given by @xmath166 we also notice that in the generic case @xmath167 and for small @xmath20 the mass transfer is essentially unidirectional on the time scale , that means the mass flows from the well with higher energy to the well with smaller energy , see figure [ fig : kramers ] .",
    "we now derive a self - consistent description for kramers type phase transitions in the presence of the dynamical constraint . to this end",
    "it is convenient to replace @xmath13 by the parameter @xmath168 defined in , and to consider the functions @xmath169 these functions are well - defined for @xmath170 and satisfy @xmath171 with @xmath172 and @xmath173 .    in terms of @xmath174 and @xmath175 ,",
    "the rescaled flux @xmath176 from can be stated as @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 as above .",
    "we next present some heuristic arguments for the dynamics of the rescaled flux terms @xmath180 and @xmath181 . to this end",
    "we assume @xmath182 and recall that , due to our assumptions on the initial data , the system evolves for small times according to the single peak evolution .",
    "in particular , the peak reaches the critical position @xmath183 at time @xmath184 with @xmath185 , and the dynamical constraint implies @xmath186 . assuming that @xmath5 changes regularly at @xmath184 , we then conclude that @xmath187 consequently , for small @xmath20 and sufficiently small times @xmath188 we expect to find @xmath189 , so crossing the energy barrier is very likely for a particle in the right well but very unlikely for a particle in the left well .",
    "however , the net transfer across the energy barrier is very small since there are essentially no particles in the right well .",
    "we thus expect that the partial masses @xmath71 stay constant in the limit @xmath190 , so the system can still be described by the single peak approximation . at some later time @xmath191",
    "we have @xmath192 and the fluxes @xmath193 and @xmath194 have the same order of magnitude . however , both are very small due to @xmath195 , and so there is , for small @xmath20 , still no effective mass transfer between the two wells of @xmath17 .",
    "the situation changes completely at time @xmath127 defined by @xmath196 . at this time",
    ", @xmath197 becomes suddenly of order one and we can no longer neglect particles that move from the left well to the right one .",
    "the other flux @xmath198 , however , is now very small as it is very unlikely that a particle moves the other way around .",
    "as explained above , the main idea in the dynamical case is that there exist a constant @xmath199 and a time @xmath128 such that @xmath200 for all @xmath201 .",
    "kramers mass flux can hence stabilize to continuously transfer mass from the left well to the right one . at time",
    "@xmath128 , all mass has been transferred to the right well and the system again evolves according to the single peak evolution , now given by .    before we describe the details of the mass transfer we proceed with two remarks .",
    "first , the above assumption @xmath202 is truly necessary : for @xmath203 there is still a time @xmath127 with @xmath204 , but then we have @xmath205 and hence @xmath206 , which shows that a net transfer from the left well to the right one is impossible .",
    "moreover , for @xmath207 both @xmath208 and @xmath198 are always very large . in both cases",
    "we expect that the phase transition occurs when @xmath103 and is not governed by kramers formula anymore but by the quasi - stationary approximation .",
    "second , the mass flux is already determined by the dynamical constraint and the assumption @xmath200 . in fact",
    ", the constraint implies that @xmath209 and thus , since @xmath5 does not change much , @xmath210 as a consequence we obtain @xmath211 for @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is defined by @xmath214 , and using @xmath215 it is easy to check that @xmath216 .      to identify the formulas that relate the mass flux self - consistently to small temporal changes in @xmath5 we consider only times @xmath4 with @xmath201 and assume that both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are strictly positive .",
    "of course , in order to match the resulting approximations for @xmath8 to the single - peak evolution for @xmath217 and @xmath218 we must introduce transition layers at @xmath219 and @xmath220 corresponding to @xmath221 and @xmath222 , respectively , but since these transition layers do not contribute to the limit model , we do not investigate them in detail .    .    the critical value @xmath199 is defined by @xmath223",
    "thanks to @xmath202 we find @xmath224 and @xmath225 , so yields @xmath226 since @xmath227 must be of order one , we introduce the rescaled multiplier @xmath228 and simplify by expanding @xmath229 around @xmath230 . using and",
    "we then conclude that kramers formula implies the mass transfer law @xmath231 comparing this with we finally conclude that kramers type phase transitions comply with the dynamical constraint if and only if @xmath232 this is the heart of our argument .",
    "if @xmath233 evolves according to , then @xmath234 is of order @xmath235 , and kramers formula provides a mass flux that satisfies the dynamical constraint .    .    in this limiting case",
    ", the phase transition happens when @xmath120 is close to @xmath236 , so both @xmath237 and @xmath153 are close to @xmath238 .",
    "moreover , the constants @xmath239 and @xmath240 approach zero , and hence we can no longer use the asymptotic expressions from the first case . however , if we expand all relevant quantities around @xmath236 and @xmath238 , it is still possible to derive an asymptotic formula for kramers flux that is consistent with the dynamical constraint .",
    "thanks to the identities @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , we deduce from the definition of @xmath244 and @xmath245 that @xmath246 to leading order in @xmath247 , we therefore find @xmath248 as well as @xmath249 so can be simplified to @xmath250 in kramers regime this flux @xmath152 should be of order @xmath13 . on the other hand , the asymptotic formula holds only if @xmath251 , and thus we shall guarantee that @xmath252 .",
    "both conditions can be satisfied if @xmath253 in fact , if we define for given @xmath72 and @xmath254 the large parameter @xmath255 by @xmath256 then @xmath152 becomes of order @xmath13 if @xmath247 is of order @xmath257 .",
    "finally , we proceed as in the first case .",

    "the dynamical constraint implies @xmath260 via , and eliminating @xmath258 we obtain @xmath261 in terms of @xmath262 .      to conclude this section we show that the quasi - stationary approximation of ( fp ) describes phase transitions with @xmath263 .",
    "notice that such type - iv transitions can be regarded as limits of type - iii transitions in the sense that @xmath264 as @xmath265 .    in the quasi - stationary limit we approximate @xmath8 by the equilibrium solution that corresponds to the current value of @xmath5 .",

    "this section concerns the effective dynamics of ( fp ) in the slow reaction regime : both @xmath13 and @xmath20 are still supposed to be small , but @xmath20 is so small that ` reactions ' , that means continuous mass transfer between the stable regions as described by kramers formula , are not relevant anymore . instead ,",
    "the dominant effect in ( fp ) is now transport along characteristics and this gives rise to new phenomena .",
    "in particular , localized peaks can enter the unstable region and peaks can split or merge rapidly .",
    "notice , however , that the small entropic effects caused by @xmath7 are still relevant and can not be neglected .",
    "they guarantee that each peak entering the unstable region is basically a rescaled gaussian , and hence that such a peak behaves in a well - defined manner .",
    "we now introduce an informal concepts that is motivated by numerical simulations and turns out to be useful for describing the asymptotic dynamics in the slow reaction regime .",
    "we say the system is in a _ two - peaks configuration _ if there exist two positions @xmath285 and two masses @xmath286 with @xmath287 such that the state can be approximated by @xmath288 a two - peaks configuration is called _ stable - stable _ if @xmath289 and @xmath290 , but _ unstable - stable _ if @xmath291 and @xmath290 . moreover , in case that one of the masses vanishes , we refer to a two - peaks configuration as a ( _ stable _ or _ unstable _ ) _ single - peak configuration_.    our main result in this section is an asymptotic description of the dynamics in a certain parameter regime for @xmath13 and @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding limit model is illustrated in figure [ fig : flow_chart ] and can be summarized as follows .",
    "suppose that the dynamical constraint and the initial data satisfy and , and that @xmath13 and @xmath20 are coupled by @xmath292 for some constant @xmath116 .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath98 the dynamics can be described in terms of single - peak and two - peaks configurations according to one of the following scenarios .    1 .   _ transport with splitting ( type - ii phase transition ) _ : there are intervals of quasi - stationary transport which are interrupted by singular times .",
    "more precisely , depending on @xmath10 and the value of the parameter @xmath293 there exists an integer @xmath294 such that there are @xmath295 _ switching times _ , @xmath255 _ splitting times _ , and a final _ merging time_. 1 .   during the intervals of quasi - stationary transport , the peaks do not exchange mass and are move according to the dynamical constraint .",
    "2 .   at each switching time",
    "a stable peak reaches the position @xmath238 to become unstable ; each switching time is followed by a splitting or the merging time .",
    "3 .   at each splitting time",
    "an unstable peaks splits and its mass is instantaneously transferred to the stable regions . in particular , the system jumps from an unstable - stable two - peaks configuration ( or , initially , from an unstable single - peak configuration ) to an emerging stable - stable two - peaks configuration .",
    "the precise values for the masses and the positions of the emerging peaks are determined by a _",
    "mass splitting problem_. 4 .   at the final merging time the two peaks of an unstable - stable configuration merge",
    " either continuously or discontinuously  to form a single stable peak located in the region @xmath296 .",
    "2 .   _ pure transport ( type - i phase transition ) _ : the system is always in a single peak configuration and there exist only two singular times corresponding to switching ( the peaks enters the unstable interval ) and trivial continuous merging ( the peak leaves the unstable interval ) .",
    "notice that it is practically impossible to perform numerical simulations with @xmath20 exponentially small in @xmath13 and @xmath13 much smaller than @xmath19 .",
    "the phase transitions of type i and type ii presented in figures [ fig : ivp1 ] and [ fig : ivp2 ] are therefore not directly covered by our limit model , but a close look to the numerical data reveals that they are likewise dominated by the interplay between transport and widening of unstable peaks . it remains a challenging task to derive next order corrections to replace the singular times by transition layers with width depending on @xmath13 .",
    "another interesting but open question is whether there exist scaling laws different from that give rise to other reasonable slow reaction limits .    to justify the limit dynamics we introduce several reduced models that allow us to study each of the different phenomena in a simplified setting . in section [ sect:31 ]",
    "we derive a _ two - peaks model _ that describes the transport of two peaks in terms of a simple ode system .",
    "moreover , this model also reveals that the separated peaks in an unstable - stable configuration can merge instantaneously due to the dynamical constraint . in section [ sect:32 ]",
    "we investigate the splitting of unstable peaks . to this end",
    "we propose a _",
    "peak - widening model _ that accounts for the small entropic effects and allows us to derive a deterministic equation for the width of an unstable peak .",
    "in particular , we show that for small @xmath13 it can happen that this width blows up almost instantaneously , which in turn gives rise to rapid mass transfer from the unstable towards the stable regions .",
    "we then discuss the _ mass splitting problem _ , which consists of solving a nonlocal transport equation in order to determine how much mass is transferred to each of the stable regions .",
    "finally , in section [ sect:33 ] we combine all partial results and characterize the limit dynamics of the original model ( fp ) . in particular , we derive explicit formulas for the iterative computation of all switching , splitting , and merging times .",
    "moreover , at the end we sketch the slow - reaction limit for non - monotone dynamical constraints .      a major tool in our analysis is a simple _ two - peaks model _ ( tp ) which describes the essential dynamics of ( fp ) as long as the system is a two - peaks configuration .",
    "the model governs the evolution of the peak positions @xmath297 and @xmath298 , and reads @xmath299 here @xmath300 and @xmath301 denote the constant masses of the peaks .",
    "notice that is just the characteristic ode for with @xmath302 , and this implies that ( tp ) is also a constrained gradient flow corresponding to the energy @xmath303 in particular , using the dissipation @xmath304 the energy balance is given by @xmath305 .    since @xmath13 is small it seems natural to neglect the time derivatives in and .",
    "this gives rise to the _ quasi - stationary approximation _ to ( tp ) , which consists of the algebraic equations @xmath306 for our analysis it is important to understand in which sense approximates ( tp ) .",
    "this problem is not trivial because the non - invertibility of @xmath36 implies that has multiple solutions for @xmath307 , and thus we have to understand which solution branches are dynamically selected by solutions to ( tp ) .    in the limit @xmath98 ,",
    "solutions to ( tp ) exhibit two important dynamical phenomena which correspond to changing the solution branch of .",
    "both phenomena seem to be counter - intuitive at a first glance but are a consequence of the dynamical constraint .",
    "they can be described as follows .",
    "first , the dynamical constraint can drive the system from a stable - stable configuration to an unstable - stable configuration , that means the stable peak at @xmath298 can stabilize an unstable one at @xmath297 due to the dynamical constraint .",
    "the second effect is that this stabilization can break down eventually .",
    "when this happens , the separated peaks merge almost instantaneously to form a single stable peak .",
    "to describe both phenomena we consider times @xmath308 and suppose that the dynamical constraint @xmath262 is smooth and strictly increasing .",
    "we also suppose that the initial data for ( tp ) are well prepared via @xmath309 to elucidate the key ideas we proceed with discussing some numerical results and present some semi - rigorous analytical considerations afterwards .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : hyperbolicinstability ] depicts a typical numerical solution to ( tp ) with @xmath310 , potential , and initial data as in .",
    "the simulation reveals the existence of two critical times @xmath127 and @xmath128 that separate the three different regimes @xmath311 where @xmath312 denotes the final simulation time .",
    "for all times @xmath313 we have @xmath314 and thus we expect that in the limit @xmath98 the system can in fact be described by quasi - stationary peaks .",
    "the details , however , are different for @xmath315 , @xmath316 , and @xmath317 . more precisely , initially we have @xmath318 that means the solution resembles a stable - stable configuration , and @xmath319 implies @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath81 . at time",
    "@xmath127 , which is defined by @xmath322 , the peak at @xmath297 enters the unstable region and the configuration switches to unstable - stable .",
    "this means @xmath323 and hence @xmath320 , @xmath324 , and @xmath325 .    at the second critical time @xmath128 ,",
    "the two - peaks approximation breaks down , that means the system can no longer be described by two separated peaks . instead",
    ", both peaks merge discontinuously , in the sense that the system jumps from an unstable - stable two - peaks configuration to a stable single - peak configuration .",
    "the evolution for @xmath218 is still quasi - stationary , but involves only a single peak that evolves according to @xmath326      as illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig : hyperbolicinstability ] , the existence of the critical time @xmath128 can be understood as follows .",
    "the quasi - stationary two - peaks approximation imposes the constraints @xmath327 which define a smooth curve in the @xmath328-plane .",
    "this curve has the two branches @xmath329 which meet smoothly at the point @xmath330 .",
    "due to the dynamical constraint the system is further confined to @xmath331 which is a straight line with slope @xmath332 .",
    "it can now easily be seen that in the quasi - stationary approximation for @xmath333 the state of the system corresponds to the unique intersection point of @xmath334 and @xmath335 , which moves towards @xmath330 since @xmath10 is increasing in time . at time @xmath127",
    ", the system crosses this point @xmath330 , and for sufficiently small times @xmath336 the state of the system is given by the unique intersection point of @xmath337 and @xmath335 . at time",
    "@xmath128 however , the line @xmath335 becomes tangential to @xmath337 and the system can no longer follow the curve @xmath337 due to @xmath319 .",
    "instead both peaks merge rapidly and the system jumps almost instantaneously to @xmath338 , which is the only intersection point of @xmath335 and the diagonal @xmath339 .",
    "the tangency condition for the merging reads @xmath340 where the left hand side is positive for all times @xmath341 .",
    "of course , if @xmath342 is very small , then the slope of @xmath335 is very negative and the tangency condition can not be satisfied . in this case",
    ", there is a continuous transition from the unstable - stable two - peaks configuration to the stable single - peak configuration since both peaks merge via @xmath343 .",
    "it is then natural to define @xmath128 as the time at which this continuous merging takes place .",
    "the above considerations also apply to the limiting case @xmath344 and @xmath345 , provided that we accept that @xmath298 is undefined . in this case",
    ", the quasi - stationary approximation reads @xmath346 and the switching time @xmath127 is defined by @xmath347 . at time",
    "@xmath128 with @xmath348 the single peak leaves the unstable interval and in view of the above discussion it makes sense to interpret this event as ( trivial ) continuous merging .",
    "we emphasize that our characterization of the unstable - stable evolution relies on condition ( a3 ) , that means on the concavity of the function @xmath349}\\mapsto x_2=x_+{{\\left({h^\\prime{{\\left({x_1}\\right)}}}\\right)}}$ ] .",
    "otherwise it may happen at time @xmath128 that the system does not jump to the diagonal but instead to another unstable - stable configuration .",
    "we also mention that discontinuous merging of peaks implies that @xmath5 jumps down to @xmath350 , and that the emerging single peak is stable due to @xmath351 .",
    "moreover , the energy of the system also jumps down .",
    "this is in line with the gradient flow structure of ( tp ) , and holds because the energy decreases along the straight line that connects @xmath328 to @xmath338 .",
    "in fact , with @xmath352 we find @xmath353 thanks to @xmath354 , @xmath355 and @xmath356 .",
    "we finally show that the quasi - stationary approximation is linearly stable until it ceases to exist . to this end , we consider a given solution to ( tp ) with @xmath310 and initial data as in , and denote by @xmath357 and @xmath358 the quasi - stationary approximation to ( tp ) .",
    "this reads @xmath359 where the definition of @xmath357 involves @xmath244 for @xmath360 but @xmath245 for @xmath361 . here , @xmath362 is the time at which the quasi - stationary approximation ceases to exist , and @xmath363 is defined by @xmath364 and denotes the switching time at which the quasi - stationary approximation enters the branch @xmath337 .    making the ansatz @xmath365",

    "the variations of constants formula now reveals that the quasi - stationary solution is dynamically stable as long as @xmath374 , that means as long as @xmath375 .",
    "moreover , a similar analysis reveals that the quasi - stationary single - peak solution @xmath376 is dynamically stable provided that @xmath377 , which is satisfied for @xmath378 due to @xmath379 .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the two - peaks model ( tp ) allows a stable peak to enter the unstable region .",
    "our goal in this section is to show that under some conditions the same is true for the original model ( fp ) , but also that the entropic terms trigger new phenomena . to point out the main idea we start with some heuristic arguments .",
    "afterwards we derive and investigate a simplified model that allows to understand the key effects in a more formal way .",
    "suppose that we are given a solution to ( fp ) that at time @xmath184 consists of two narrow stable peaks located at positions @xmath380 and @xmath381 .",
    "suppose also that the width of these peaks is sufficiently narrow such that @xmath382 . for small @xmath13",
    "we then expect that the system relaxes very fast to a meta - stable state of ( fp ) that meets the constraint @xmath383 . without loss of generality",
    "we may hence assume that the initial peaks have width of order @xmath20 and that the initial data are well prepared in the sense of    for sufficiently small times @xmath188 we can expect that ( fp ) follows the two - peaks model ( tp ) , that means both peaks have width of order @xmath20 and are located at stable positions @xmath384 , @xmath385 with @xmath320 and @xmath321 due to @xmath319 . at some time @xmath127 , however , the peak located at @xmath297 reaches the critical position @xmath238 , and this time can be estimated by @xmath386 .",
    "when the first peak has crossed @xmath238 , its width widens very quickly because the characteristics of the transport term now separate exponentially with local rate @xmath387 .",
    "however , since the width of the first peak is initially exponentially small in @xmath13 , it remains small for some times although it is surely much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the second peak located at @xmath298 still has width of order @xmath20 as it remains confined to the stable region @xmath35 . combining both arguments",
    "we conclude that the system can be approximated by ( tp ) even at times @xmath336 provided that @xmath388 is sufficiently small .",
    "the condition @xmath319 then implies @xmath320 , @xmath324 and @xmath389 .",
    "the key question now is how long the first peak remains localized .",
    "depending on the scaling parameter @xmath293 and the mass distribution between the peaks , it can happen that the first peak remains localized until both peaks merge continuously via @xmath390 . in this case",
    "the first peak can in fact pass through the whole unstable region .",
    "it can also happen that the peak remains localized till the quasi - stationary two - peaks approximation ceases to exist . in this case",
    "both peaks merge instantaneously and discontinuously to form a single stable peak , but ( fp ) still behaves like ( tp ) .",
    "there is , however , a third possible scenario , in which the width of the first peak becomes of order one before both peaks can merge continuously or discontinuously .",
    "below we will argue that if this happens at all , it happens at a precise time @xmath128 .",
    "more precisely , we show that there is a time @xmath128 at which the width of the first peak blows up instantaneously for small @xmath13 . some amount of the mass of this peak is then transported along characteristics to the left until it creates a new peak in the stable region @xmath391 .",
    "the remaining part , however , is transported towards the other stable region @xmath35 to feed the second peak . since the transport along characteristics if very fast , we expect that in the limit @xmath98 the first peak splits and disappears instantaneously and that the system jumps to another stable - stable configuration .",
    "after this jump the new peak in the stable region @xmath391 has mass smaller than @xmath300 , and this implies that the mass of the second peak is larger than @xmath342 .      to analyze the relevant phenomena we study a simplified _ peak - widening model _ ( pw ) , which approximates the second peak at @xmath298 by a dirac mass but keeps the probabilistic description for the first peak located at @xmath297 .",
    "this gives rise to the equations @xmath392 here @xmath300 and @xmath301 are two constants that describe the mass distribution between the peaks , and as long as @xmath298 is confined to the stable region @xmath35 we can expect that each solution to ( pw ) defines via @xmath393 an ( approximate ) solution to the original model ( fp ) .    in what follows",
    "we denote the width of the first peak by @xmath394 and aim to derive an asymptotic formula for the evolution of @xmath394 that involves only the dynamical constraint @xmath262 . for simplicity",
    "we assume again that the data at time @xmath184 are localized and well prepared in the sense of @xmath395 a key ingredient to any asymptotic analysis of the widening phenomenon is to give an appropriate description of the position of the first peak .",
    "our ansatz is to define @xmath396 as solution of the characteristic ode , that means we set @xmath397 this ansatz has the following advantages .",
    "as long as the first peak is narrow , we have @xmath398 and hence @xmath297 and @xmath298 evolve according to the two - peaks model ( tp ) .",
    "consequently , for @xmath310 we can describe @xmath297 and @xmath298 in terms of the quasi - stationary approximations of ( tpm ) , whose dynamics is completely determined by the dynamical constraint @xmath262 and the mass distribution between the peaks , see .",
    "a further advantage of is that it gives rise to a quite simple evolution law for @xmath394 .      in order to analyze the growth of @xmath394 we introduce the rescaling @xmath399 where both the spatial scaling factor @xmath400 and the rescaled time @xmath401 will be identified below .",
    "we then have @xmath402 , where @xmath403 is the width of @xmath404 at @xmath405 .",
    "we readily verify that and imply that the evolution of @xmath404 is governed by @xmath406 for the subsequent considerations we now assume that @xmath396 is a given continuous function with @xmath322 and @xmath407 for some @xmath312 .",
    "heuristically , @xmath312 is the time at which both peaks merge ( continuously or discontinuously ) according to the two - peaks model ( tp ) .",
    "as long as @xmath394 is small  but possibly much larger than @xmath20  we can expand the nonlinearity according to @xmath408 neglecting the higher order terms and defining @xmath409 and @xmath405 as solutions to @xmath410 the nonlinear pde transforms into the heat equation @xmath411 consequently , for large @xmath405 the rescaled profile @xmath404 evolves in an almost self - similar manner , that means we can approximate @xmath412 notice that this approximation implies @xmath413 for @xmath414 and holds as long as @xmath415 is of order @xmath19 . in order to characterize the width of the original peak it remains to understand how @xmath416 and @xmath405 depend on @xmath4 .",
    "a direct computation yields @xmath417 where @xmath418 abbreviates @xmath419 due to @xmath310 and @xmath420 we now infer that @xmath421 for all @xmath422 .",

    "this means there exists a first splitting time with @xmath505 at which the system jumps from the unstable single - peak configuration to a stable - stable two - peaks configuration , where the masses and the positions of the emerging stable peaks is determined by the mass splitting problem . in particular , after the first splitting event the positions @xmath297 , @xmath298 and the masses @xmath300 , @xmath342 are well defined , and both stable peaks move according to the dynamical constraint until the first peak located at @xmath297 becomes unstable at the next switching time defined by @xmath506 .",
    "afterwards we must carefully investigate the unstable - stable evolution in order to decide whether there is a further splitting of the unstable peak or whether both peaks finally merge continuously or discontinuously .    in summary",
    ", the limit dynamics can be described as illustrated in figure [ fig : flow_chart ] , that means intervals of quasi - stationary transport are interrupted by singular times corresponding to the following types of events :    @xmath101    the peak at @xmath297 enters the unstable region .",
    "the unstable peak at @xmath297 splits and the system jumps to a new stable - stable configuration with decreased mass @xmath300 and increased mass @xmath342 .    the peaks in an unstable - stable configuration merge either continuously ( with @xmath507 ) or discontinuously ( with @xmath508 ) , or there is only a single peak with @xmath344 that leaves the unstable region ( with @xmath506 ) .",
    "more precisely , each limit trajectory comprises @xmath295 switching times , @xmath255 splitting times , and a final merging time @xmath509 where we have @xmath510 and @xmath294 for type - i and type - ii transitions , respectively . here",
    "@xmath511 is defined by @xmath512 , so proper two - peaks configurations can only exist for @xmath513 .",
    "notice that an infinite number of switching and splitting events is not possible because the splitting condition implies a lower bound for @xmath514 via @xmath515 with @xmath516 .",
    "notice also that we must truly book keep the switching events since doe not determine @xmath517 but only @xmath514 .",
    "we now describe the flowchart from figure [ fig : flow_chart ] in greater detail .    .    between consecutive singular times , and likewise initially for @xmath518 , the dynamics of @xmath297 and @xmath298",
    "is governed by a rate - independent system of non - autonomous odes .",
    "more precisely , differentiating with respect to time yields @xmath519 where we recall that @xmath297 and @xmath298 remain undefined for @xmath496 and @xmath345 , respectively .",
    "these odes imply @xmath520 with @xmath521 since the dynamical constraint @xmath262 is given , the initial value problem to can  at least in principle  be integrated .    .",
    "at switching times all functions are continuous , that means we have @xmath522\\!|}}{{\\left({t_{{\\mathrm{sw}},k}}\\right)}}={{|\\![x_i]\\!|}}{{\\left({t_{{\\mathrm{sw}},k}}\\right)}}= { { |\\![{{\\sigma}}]\\!|}}{{\\left({t_{{\\mathrm{sw}},k}}\\right)}}={{|\\![e]\\!|}}{{\\left({t_{{\\mathrm{sw}},k}}\\right)}}=0\\,,\\qquad i=1,2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath523\\!|}}{{\\left({t}\\right)}}:= f{{\\left({t+0}\\right)}}-f{{\\left({t-0}\\right)}}$ ] with @xmath524 denotes the jump of the function @xmath418 at time @xmath4 .    at a splitting time",
    "all quantities do jump , where the jump heights are determined by the mass splitting problem ( ms ) .",

    "finally , at the merging time we have @xmath527 and the concavity condition ( a3 ) , see the discussion at the end of section [ sect:312 ] , provides @xmath525\\!|}}{{\\left({t_{{\\mathrm{me}}}}\\right)}}\\leq0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with strict inequality for discontinuous merging .",
    "after the merging the precise values masses @xmath300 and @xmath342 are actually undefined , but it seems natural to set @xmath528    .",
    "after the @xmath529 splitting time ( we set @xmath530 to describe the initial evolution ) , the system is in a stable - stable configuration and the subsequent switching time @xmath531 is the smallest time larger than @xmath517 such that @xmath532 .",
    "this implies @xmath533 , @xmath534 , and @xmath535 which determines @xmath531 uniquely since @xmath300 and @xmath342 are known .",
    "after the switching event at @xmath536 we have to decide whether the next singular time corresponds to splitting or merging according to the conditions @xmath537 to discuss this decision in a simple case , let us suppose that @xmath18 is constant in time .",
    "due to @xmath325 we can replace @xmath4 by @xmath120 , and direct computations provide the following nonlinear equations @xmath538 in particular , both merging conditions are rate independent , whereas the switching condition depends on @xmath18 and can not be satisfied for large @xmath18 .",
    "this is not surprising because the merging conditions are completely determined by the quasi - stationary two - peak approximation , whereas splitting only happens if the peak widening due to the separation of characteristics is faster than the transport due to the dynamical constraint .    instead of solving ,",
    "we can now vary @xmath5 , starting from @xmath539 and moving towards @xmath540 , and check which conditions is satisfied at first . in any case , the time @xmath541 of the next singular event can be computed by @xmath542      we finally derive an alternative description of the slow reaction limit that covers arbitrary dynamical constraints @xmath10 .",
    "decreasing constraints can produce stable - unstable configurations with @xmath289 and @xmath543 , which in turn can split or merge .",
    "however , these effects can easily be described by adopting the formulas from sections [ sect:31 ] and [ sect:32 ] .",
    "the truly new effect is that non - monotone constraints can trigger _ inverse switching events _ , that means , for instance , an unstable - stable configuration can become stable - stable via @xmath544 with @xmath545 .    for general constraints",
    ", it is convenient to describe the slow - reaction limit in terms of the following variables : @xmath546 the dynamical multiplier @xmath5 , @xmath547 an internal variable @xmath548}$ ] as introduced in section [ sect:32 ] to control the width of an unstable peak , and @xmath549 three nonnegative masses @xmath68 , @xmath550 , and @xmath69 with @xmath551 to describe the several types of single - peak and two - peaks configurations .",
    "using these parameters , the peak positions are dependent variables which satisfy @xmath552 for @xmath553 as long as @xmath554 is well - defined .    at each non - singular time",
    ", the system is confined to one of the sets defined in table [ tbl : sets ] , where @xmath555 and @xmath556 are abbreviations for @xmath557 and the functions @xmath558 are defined by @xmath559within each of these sets , the peaks are transported according to the quasi - stationary two - peaks approximation and the widening of unstable peaks is governed by @xmath560 as described in and .",
    "this reads @xmath561    on the other hand , singular events happen when the system reaches the boundary of either @xmath562 or @xmath563 . more precisely , examing the conditions for switching , inverse switching , splitting , and merging we arrive at list from table [ tbl : events ] , where we now interpret trivial continuous merging as inverse switching of single - peak configurations .",
    "the corresponding jump and update rules for the variables @xmath564 , @xmath5 , and @xmath560 are summarized in table [ tbl : jumps ] .",
    "the slow reaction dynamics of two - peaks initial data can now be integrated iteratively by @xmath546 moving via along either one of the sets @xmath562 and @xmath563 , and @xmath547 jumping to another set when reaching the boundary .",
