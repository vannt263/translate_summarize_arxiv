    "surface roughness induces losses in neutron guide tubes and affects the behavior of a ucn gas in a trap .",
    "we investigate especially the relation between a realistic account of roughness in computer simulations of ucn storage and a reliable data interpretation with respect to the neutron lifetime . the issue has gained added importance since a new ucn storage based lifetime value six standard deviation away from the world average value [ 2 ] was published in 2005 [ 3 ] .",
    "most theoretical analyses of diffuse cold and ultracold neutron scattering at surfaces with small roughness ( e.g. , [ 4 - 7 ] ) are based on first - order perturbation theory . a possible extension to macroscopic ray optics",

    "we used a more direct approach , verified and quantified the result of [ 7 ] , and in the process obtained a derivation of the `` debye - waller factor '' ( describing the attenuation of the specular beam due to roughness ) , that is consistent with standard expressions but requires fewer assumptions about the roughness characteristics .",
    "this appears important since in practical cases very little is known about the roughness parameters of a given surface .",

    "the difficulty of distinguishing between roughness models for the trap on the basis of measured curves broadened 3 to 6 times by the response , or resolution , function is exacerbated by two aspects : first , by the uncertainty introduced by any simplification of the complex channel geometry , as needed to make the simulations feasible .",

    "using the transformation @xmath428 and the relationship @xmath429 the integrations over @xmath74 in ( 17)-(20 ) can be performed analytically .",
    "the integrations run from 0 to @xmath430 where @xmath431 since the @xmath74-integrals needed in ( 18 ) to ( 20 ) do not appear to be readily available from tables or websites we list two results @xmath432 and @xmath433 where [ 19 ] @xmath434 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind , @xmath435 is the incomplete integral of the second kind , and @xmath436 and @xmath437 are the corresponding complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "the arguments in ( d2 ) and ( d3 ) are + @xmath438 ; @xmath439 ; @xmath440 ; @xmath441 ; @xmath442 ; @xmath443 ; @xmath444    compared to numerical double integration , the use of these readily available functions in one of the integrals as well as tabulation of the numerical results for use in simulations is of enormous benefit .",
    "in the geometrical optics model , reflection is considered as an incoherent superposition of rays reflected at each speck of a fairly smooth surface ( @xmath99 ) as if it were a plane inclined at the local slope .",
    "the analysis is based on a slope distribution function @xmath445 that has to be postulated independently of the correlation function @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , @xmath445 does not have to be gaussian if @xmath24 has been chosen gaussian . if the simplest gaussian is chosen , as in [ 4 ] , it is of form @xmath446 which is normalized and has the correct second moment @xmath447 the ambiguity is more obvious for the @xmath7 model . requiring that @xmath445 should be a monotonic , bounded function , exhibit an asymptotic",

    "the _ k _ model , as compared with the gauss model , describes a surface with higher probability of large slope ( @xmath458 ) at the expense of areas with a very small slope .    in the macroscopic - roughness model",
    "the probability of scattering ( local reflection ) from @xmath205 to @xmath206 , i.e. from angles @xmath459 to @xmath69 , at suitably oriented surface elements is : @xmath460 the mapping @xmath461 involves the local polar angle of incidence , @xmath462 , where @xmath463 with @xmath464 $ ] .",

    "it exhibits a similar width of scattering distribution around the regular reflection angle @xmath459 but no exactly specular intensity .",
    "local angle @xmath467 dependent loss could be incorporated in the form @xmath468 as for a plane surface , but the result is not identical to the micro - roughness result in the limit @xmath469 .",
    "expression ( e6 ) and similar expressions for non - gaussian models are symmetric in @xmath205 and @xmath206 , thus do not satisfy the detailed balance requirement discussed in section 6 , and indeed give rise to loss of isotropy in computer simulations .",
    "moreover , ( e6 ) is catastrophically inadequate for glancing - angle incidence ( @xmath470 ) due to shadowing and multiple reflection within a rough surface as discussed in section 6 .",
    "although this angular range is small , it makes a large contribution to the mean value for isotropic incident ucn flux and can not be neglected .",
