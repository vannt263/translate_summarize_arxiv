    "there are several approaches to calculate the @xmath4 transition form factors , such as the lattice qcd technique , the qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsrs ) and the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach .",
    "the pqcd calculation is more reliable when the involved energy scale is hard , i.e. in the large recoil regions ; the lattice qcd results of the @xmath5 transition form factors are available only for soft regions ; while , the qcd lcsrs can involve both the hard and the soft contributions below @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is a typical hadronic scale of roughly @xmath8 mev ) and can be extrapolated to higher @xmath9 regions .",
    "therefore , the results from the pqcd approach , the lattice qcd approach and the qcd lcsrs are complementary to each other , and by combining the results from these three methods , one may obtain a full understanding of the @xmath5 transition form factors in its whole physical region . in refs.@xcite , we have done a consistent analysis of the @xmath10 transition form factor in the whole physical region .",
    "similarly , one can obtain a deep understanding of the @xmath0 transition form factor in the physical energy regions by combining the qcd lcsr results with the pqcd results and by properly taking the @xmath1 breaking effects into account .",

    "so in the following , we shall concentrate our attention on @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath0 transition form factor has been analyzed by several groups under the qcd lcsr approach @xcite , where some extra treatments to the correlation function either from the b - meson side or from the kaonic side are adopted to improve their lcsr estimations .",
    "it is found that the main uncertainties in estimation of the @xmath0 transition form factor come from the different twist structures of the kaon wave functions .",
    "it has been found that by choosing proper chiral currents in the lcsr approach , the contributions from the pseudo - scalars twist-3 structures to the form factor can be eliminated @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we calculate the @xmath0 form factor with chiral current in the lcsr approach to eliminate the most uncertain twist-3 light - cone functions contributions . and",
    "more accurately , we calculate the @xmath19 corrections to the kaonic twist-2 terms .",
    "the @xmath1-breaking effects from the twist-2 and twist-4 kaon wave functions shall also be discussed .    in ref@xcite , we have calculated the @xmath0 transition form factor up to @xmath3 in the large recoil region within the pqcd approach @xcite , where the b - meson wave functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 that include the three - fock states contributions are adopted and the transverse momentum dependence for both the hard scattering part and the non - perturbative wave function , the sudakov effects and the threshold effects are included to regulate the endpoint singularity and to derive a more reliable pqcd result . further more , the contributions from different twist structures of the kaon wave function , including its @xmath1-breaking effects , are discussed .",
    "so we shall adopt the pqcd results of ref.@xcite to do our discussion , i.e. to give a consistent analysis of the @xmath0 transition form factor in the large and intermediate energy regions with the help of the lcsr and the pqcd results .",

    ", we present the results for the @xmath0 transition form factor within the qcd lcsr approach . in sec.iii",

    "numerical results is given in sec.iv , where the uncertainties of the lcsr results and a consistent analysis of the @xmath0 transition form factor in the large and intermediate energy regions by combining the qcd lcsr result with the pqcd result is presented .",
