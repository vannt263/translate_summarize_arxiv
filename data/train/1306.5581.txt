    "these are highly ionised in hot stars , effectively decreasing the opacity , and therefore o and b type stars have much weaker breaks compared to later spectral types @xcite .",
    "since hot ( massive ) stars have short lives , the strength of the 4000  break for a single stellar population ( ssp ) increases with its age .",
    "there is also a dependency with the metallicity , but it only becomes significant for old stellar populations ( see figure [ models ] ) . in the integrated spectrum of a galaxy , emission from hot young stars can easily outshine the old population and produce a weak 4000  break even if they only represent a small fraction of the total stellar mass in the galaxy . therefore , the 4000  break provides a light - weighted characteristic age for the galaxy , which is close to the mass - weighted age only for passively evolving galaxies .",

    "the track for constant sfr in figure [ dn4000-uv - tracks ] overlaps with that of a ssp 0.3 gyr old .",
    "this implies that galaxies with @xmath60@xmath48.5 have experienced a recent ( @xmath4300 myr ) increase in their sfr , while those with larger values are experiencing a decline in their sfr at least in the last few hundred myr .",
    "figure [ red - sequence ] shows the fraction of galaxies with @xmath610.3 gyr ( that is , with declining sfr ) as a function of m@xmath1 for both our sample and the local sdss sample of @xcite . in the latter we assumed solar metallicity and a typical extinction of a@xmath36=1 to convert their values to @xmath58 ( @xmath58=0.3 gyr corresponds to = 1.3 ) .",

    "this indicates that at @xmath5@xmath70.9 star formation is clearly in decline or halted in the most massive galaxies , but it is still increasing for galaxies below 10@xmath45 m@xmath2 , in qualitative agreement with the downsizing paradigm . on the other hand , in the local sdss sample",
    "the sfr is predominantly in decline except perhaps in the lowest mass bin , and the fraction of @xmath610.3 gyr sources reaches levels close to 100% in the most massive bin .",
    "note , however , that a decline in sfr does not necessarily imply that these galaxies will undergo passive evolution down to @xmath5@xmath70 .",
    "if we were to start from the 0.65@xmath4@xmath5@xmath41.07 sample and apply passive evolution during the next 57 gyr , their distribution at @xmath5@xmath70.1 ( the median redshift of the sdss sample ) would be pushed to the right and compressed in the interval @xmath71.92.1 .",
    "clearly , this is not what we see in the sdss sample ( figure [ compare - kauffmann ] ) , albeit one half of the galaxies in the highest mass bin have @xmath101.9 , equivalent to @xmath58@xmath104 gyr .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of @xmath58@xmath100.3 gyr sources in the shards sample is roughly twice the fraction of @xmath58@xmath104 gyr sources in the sdss sample in all the mass bins . when accounting for the doubling in the comoving density of galaxies with 10@xmath12@xmath4 m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath410@xmath62 since @xmath5@xmath70.9 [ pg08 ] , we have roughly one quiescent galaxy with @xmath58@xmath104 gyr in the sdss sample for every galaxy with declining sfr in the shards sample .",
    "this suggests that most of these intermediate-@xmath5 galaxies might never reactivate their star formation but instead evolve passively until the present time .    in the intermediate mass bins ( 10@xmath12@xmath4m@xmath1/m@xmath2@xmath410@xmath11 )",
    ", about 50% is increasing its sfr and the other 50% decreasing in the shards sample .",
    "their distribution peaks close to @xmath60=8.5 , which may be interpreted in two ways : either most of the galaxies in this mass range sustain relatively stable sfrs , or they undergo repeated episodes of star formation , separated by more quiescent periods no longer than a few hundred myr .    the highest values observed in the sample , @xmath71.8 , correspond to @xmath58@xmath73 - 4 gyr or @xmath27=1 gyr for a 6 gyr old galaxy with an exponentially declining sfr . in any case , this implies that more than 80% of the stellar mass in these galaxies was already in place 4 gyr earlier ( that is , at @xmath5@xmath724 ) than the epoch observed here .",
    "however , these very old galaxies represent only a very small fraction of the massive galaxies in the sample .",

    "when considering individual sources , both and ( u - v)@xmath9 correlate with m@xmath1 .",
    "the dispersion in values at a given m@xmath1 increases with m@xmath1 , while for ( u - v)@xmath9 decreases due to the higher average extinction prevalent in massive star - forming galaxies .",

    "this method allows us to break the degeneracy between age and extinction , and to produce extinction - corrected observables .",
    "the extinction corrected u - v colour of blue cloud galaxies in our sample is consistent with other studies at similar redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , for massive galaxies we find a smooth transition towards the red sequence , with many sources at intermediate colours , in contrast to the strong bimodality found by @xcite .",
    "we interpret the discrepancy as due to differences in the methods used to estimate the extinction affecting the stellar population .",
    "compared to local galaxies , the distributions of for our sample peak at lower values indicative of younger stellar populations for all mass ranges .",
    "the bimodal distribution of is rather absent at @xmath5@xmath70.9 contrarily to the stark one observed in local galaxies , because even the most massive , already quiescent galaxies have not had enough time to evolve sufficiently their stellar populations .",
    "we find a relatively sharp transition at m@xmath1@xmath710@xmath45m@xmath2 from a distribution dominated by young stellar populations to another where there are comparable numbers of galaxies with young and old stars .",
    "when galaxies are grouped by their light weighted stellar ages , we find a weak positive correlation between extinction and stellar mass , which probably arises from the well - known correlation between stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "the fraction of shards sources where star formation is in decline increases steadily with the stellar mass , from @xmath75% at @xmath0(m@xmath1/m@xmath2)=9.09.5 to @xmath780% at @xmath0(m@xmath1/m@xmath2)@xmath1011 .",

    "the cut in optical magnitude ensures the spectrum has a well detected continuum and the 4000  break can be properly measured in the full resolution spectrum .",
    "photometric errors are simulated by adding to each magnitude an error term m@xmath65 = 0.1@xmath13 , where @xmath13 is a random variable with normal distribution .",

    "most recent studies prefer the narrow definition of the 4000  index due to its lower dependency on extinction .",
    "this is thus the most convenient definition for comparison with results from other samples .",

    "nevertheless , the linear model fails to predict the convergence of d4@xmath67 and dn4@xmath66 values at d4@xmath67 = dn4@xmath66 = 1 , which is caused by the index measurement becoming insensitive to the spectral resolution in sources with a flat spectrum near 4000  . on the other hand",

    "because of this issues , the parabolic model is preferred over the linear one .",
    "the calibration used to obtain corrected values assumes photometric uncertainties around 0.1 magnitudes , but in some sources ( particularly the more massive galaxies ) these can be an order of magnitude lower . repeating the above calibration steps on simulated shards data with 0.01 magnitudes uncertainties yields nearly identical calibration coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the dispersion of residuals is only slightly lower ( figure [ delta - dn4000-synth ] ) , indicating that it is the interpolation error , and not the photometric errors , the main cause of dispersion in the dn4@xmath68 versus dn4@xmath66 relationship ."
