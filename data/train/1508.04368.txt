    "there is great current interest in quantum and nanoscale systems that convert heat into electric current  @xcite .",
    "the simplest such systems are those that exhibit a thermoelectric effect @xcite : they do the conversion in a steady - state ( dc ) manner , and so avoid the need for pumping cycles relying on time - dependent couplings .",
    "quantum dots are particularly promising in this respect , and various applications have been proposed and ( at least partially ) realized experimentally , including thermoelectric engines  @xcite , refrigerators  @xcite , thermal rectifiers  @xcite , and hybrid refrigerator power - sources @xcite . in addition , the simplicity of these thermoelectric quantum dots makes them ideal model systems for the study of quantum thermodynamics .",
    "the most developed theory of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , known as irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , assumes that the shortest lengthscale in the system is that on which the particles thermalize ( the inelastic scattering length ) .",
    "then , any system coupled between two reservoirs at very different temperatures has a well - defined local temperature everywhere within it . however , as we reduce the size of the circuit elements into the nanoscale regime , this ceases to be the case . a system that is much smaller than the electron thermalization length will be in a _ non - thermal state _ whenever it is coupled to reservoirs that are at significantly different temperatures or electrochemical potentials . in other words ,",
    "the distribution of the excitations in the system can not be described in terms of a thermal distribution .    in general",
    ", we wish to answer the question : what new physics can emerge in a quantum system operating in this non - thermal regime ?",
    "this work presents a first response to this question , in the context of the thermoelectric quantum dot system sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : system](a ) . this can be considered as a miniaturized version of the usual macroscopic thermocouple power generator , in which the macroscopic metal reservoir between the two thermoelectrics has been replaced by the quantum dot m. our system is similar to three - terminal energy harvesters considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , which separate the conductor from a heats source with which it exchanges energy but no particles .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite , which consider related models with bosonic heat sources .",
    "however , instead of the dot being coupled only to the heat source ( reservoir h ) , we consider the case when it is also coupled to the cold environment ( reservoir c ) .",
    "since the environment coupling is never negligible , we argue that this is the generic case .",
    "it is certainly the case in conventional thermocouples , where it is well known that the region between the two thermoelectrics is not as hot as the heat - source , because it also exchanges heat with the cold environment . with this in mind",
    ", the simplest case would be when the temperature of the cold environment @xmath1 is the same as the temperature @xmath2 of the electrical circuit in which the thermocouple is inserted ( reservoirs l and r ) .",
    "however , we consider the more general case where @xmath3 is different from @xmath4 , for example due to joule heating in the wires or load ( @xmath5 ) . following what is known about conventional thermocouples",
    ", one would expect the energy available to produce electricity to be equal to the heat that flows in from reservoir h minus the heat that is lost as it flows out into reservoir c. we call this quantity @xmath6 , and study how the power generated by a quantum dot thermocouple , @xmath7 , depends on it .    in this work",
    ", we show that the quantum - dot thermocouple can generate power even when the total heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs ( h and c ) is zero ( @xmath8 )",
    ". instead , the dot extracts heat from the electronic reservoirs ( l and r ) and converts it into electrical power .",
    "it might appear that this `` exotic '' power generation violates the laws of thermodynamics ( since the thermal reservoirs provide no energy to allow the dot to convert heat into work ) , but we show that this is not the case . it can be explained in terms of a non - local heat drag effect , in which the heat flow from h to c can induce heat and charge currents in the circuit ( i.e. through the thermoelectric contacts to reservoirs r and l ) even when @xmath8 .",
    "we show that this exotic power generation only arises because no thermalization occurs within the quantum dot , meaning that the dot is maintained in a non - thermal state by its contact with the hot and cold reservoirs . as such it has no analogue in conventional thermocouples .",
    "we argue that as a result a quantum - dot thermocouple can achieve power outputs larger than any conventional thermocouple ( even one working with carnot efficiency ) over a broad range of parameters .",
    "this is not because our device has an efficiency higher than carnot efficiency ( this is forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics ) , but because it can also extract useful work from the non - local drag effect .",
    "this is something a conventional thermocouple can not do , irrespective of how efficient it is .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : quantum - dot ] , we introduce our model of the quantum dot thermocouple .",
    "[ sect : v=0 ] discusses the basic mechanisms behind the rectification of heat fluctuations in our device , in the simpler case where it generates no power .",
    "[ sect : finite - power ] gives results for the power generation , which sec .",
    "[ sect : interpretation ] explains in terms of non - local heat drag , shows that it obeys the laws of thermodynamics , and discusses potential experimental implementation .",
    "[ sect : thermalize ] shows that the effect is suppressed if relaxation processes cause the state of dot m to become thermal . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sect : thermocouple ] , we compare the power output of the quantum dot thermocouple with that of a conventional thermocouple for a broad range of parameters .",
    "the quantum dot m , shown in fig .  [ fig : system](a ) , can exchange energy ( but not charge ) with a hot ( h ) and a cold ( c ) thermal reservoir . in the following we are interested in the resulting amount of electrical power that this quantum dot can produce by driving an electric current between the left ( l ) and right ( r ) electron reservoirs , to which it is tunnel - coupled .",
    "importantly , while the reservoirs are characterized by temperatures , the quantum dot is generally in a _ non - thermal _ state .",
    "this is a crucial point of our paper and an important difference to conventional macroscopic thermocouples , which are large enough such that every element of the thermocouple is able to thermalize .",
    "the energy exchange of the quantum dot m with the thermal reservoirs h and c occurs via a capacitative coupling to thermal fluctuations in these reservoirs .",
    "they are modeled as thermally activated hopping of electrons between the bulk of each of the two thermal reservoirs and a localized state on their surface .",
    "the localized states can be thought of as quantum dots , which enables us to recast the problem as the triple - dot circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system](b ) . here , the localized states associated with reservoirs h and c are the upper red and blue dots . apart from thermoelectric purposes , similar models have been useful for relaxation times detection  @xcite , maxwell demon physics  @xcite , and the operation of stochastic logic gates  @xcite .",
    "we therefore now consider the three capacitively coupled quantum dots m , h , and c , in contact with four electronic reservoirs h , c , l , and r , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system](b ) .",
    "we assume that the on - site coulomb repulsion is very large , such that doubly occupation of any dot can be neglected . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the spin degree of freedom of the electrons , which , in this case , does not alter the working principle of the device , see also  @xcite ( note however , that in general the spin might play an important role in quantum - dot based heat engines  @xcite ) .",
    "the isolated system of three capacitively coupled quantum dots can then be described by the model hamiltonian @xmath9 with the number operator @xmath10 counting the number of electrons ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) on each of the three dots , @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 are the energies for single occupation of the different dots and @xmath15 represents the coulomb charging energy that needs to be paid to have both dots @xmath16 and @xmath17 occupied simultaneously .",
    "they play an essential role , as they mediate the energy exchange between the different dots .",
    "the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are given by the eight states @xmath18 with eigenenergies @xmath19 , where the labels @xmath20 can take the values @xmath11 ( empty ) and @xmath12 ( full ) depending on the occupation of the respective dots m , h , and c.    transitions between eigenstates of the triple - dot system can occur due to the tunnel coupling of these dots to the electronic reservoirs .",
    "these reservoirs are kept at temperatures @xmath21 and electrochemical potentials @xmath22 . here",
    "we take the temperature of the hot reservoir to be always larger than the temperature of the cold reservoir , @xmath23 .",
    "the left and right reservoirs are assumed to be at the same temperature , @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in this paper , we are interested in the power that the quantum - dot thermocouple can generate , by driving an electrical current against a potential difference ( due to a load ) .",
    "a simple way of implementing this setting is the one where we take the electrochemical potential of the right lead to be @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the electron charge ) with respect to the equal electrochemical potentials of the other reservoirs , which we take as the reference energy here , @xmath28 .    the coupling between the quantum dots and the reservoirs , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system](b ) , is characterized by the tunnel coupling strengths , @xmath29 .",
    "we focus on a situation , where the dots are weakly coupled to the reservoirs , @xmath30 .",
    "importantly , since we are interested in the quantum dot m behaving as a thermoelectric , we require that @xmath31 and @xmath32 depend on energy  @xcite . because of the capacitive coupling between the dots , this means in turn that they depend on the occupation @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the dots h and c , yielding @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "a strong energy - dependence of the tunnel - coupling can be achieved for example by coupling the quantum dot to the reservoirs via other resonant levels  @xcite .",
    "this is not required for the tunnel - coupling between the thermal baths and the nearby quantum dots .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 to be energy - independent .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state response of the system to different temperature in the heat baths , in the presence of a possible voltage drop across the reservoirs l and r , which results in power being generated across the load . in order to calculate the dc charge and heat currents , the occupation probabilities @xmath39 of the states @xmath18 of the triple - dot system are required . in the weak - coupling regime , these probabilities are given by the solution of the steady - state master equation  @xcite , @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "( ii ) the capacitive coupling between dot h and c is strong enough that @xmath65 is very much bigger than all temperatures , so the probability that these two dots are occupied at the same time becomes vanishingly small .",
    "we will relax both these assumption in section [ sect : finite - power ] .    for strong @xmath65 , the states ( 0,1,1 ) and ( 1,1,1 ) drop out of the problem . in this limit , the charge fluctuations that lead to transport through the conductor can be separated in two cycles . the first cycle is    [ eq : cycles ] @xmath66 and involves an energy exchange @xmath67 between the system and the hot reservoirs .",
    "the second cycle is @xmath68    and involves an energy exchange @xmath69 between the system and the cold reservoir .",
    "when the tunneling events in these sequences involve an electron that tunnels from reservoir l into the dot , and thereafter into reservoir r ( or viceversa ) , it contributes to transport .",
    "the sum of all tunneling processes results in the generation of a finite electric current by the mere conversion of heat , only if a preferred direction is defined both by broken electron - hole and left - right symmetries  @xcite .",

    "the figure shows that the exotic power generation still exists for this imperfect pump , although its magnitude is greatly reduced ( just as the traditional power generation is greatly reduced ) .",
    "the charge current we found in sec .  [ sect : v=0 ] for @xmath81 is due to a form of coulomb heat drag , in which the heat flow from reservoir h to reservoir c , _ drags _ a heat and charge currents from reservoir l to r. this is possible due to the capacitive coupling between the quantum dots .",
    "however , in other drag effects @xcite , there is a transfer of energy associated with one current dragging the other , which corresponds to finite @xmath79 .",
    "hence , this drag effect without energy transfer is extremely unusual .",
    "this heat drag effect can occur for any @xmath148 irrespective of the value of @xmath92 , since it only requires a heat flow from reservoir h to reservoir c. the quantum dot thermocouple then produces more work than a classical one ( see the discussion in sec.7 ) .",
    "remarkably , this does not only occur in the configurations where @xmath149 , but also in a relatively wide parameter range around this points , including the case @xmath150 .",
    "the entropy generated in each reservoir ( main plot ) and @xmath78 ( inset ) for the system in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic - effect - other - parameters ] .",
    "the entropy generated in reservoirs l , r and h are small in magnitude and their sum is negative , however the entropy generated in reservoir c is large and positive .",
    "thus , the second law of thermodynamics is not violated .",
    "we see that the rate of entropy production broadly follows @xmath78 ( inset ) .",
    "we do not show plots of entropy production and @xmath78 for the system in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic - effect ] , as the main features are generic to all of them . ]    despite the unusualness of the coulomb drag without energy transfer discussed above , the situation is not paradoxical as long as @xmath73 .",
    "the case @xmath73 corresponds to a load with zero resistance , so nothing opposes the charge flow , and so no work is required to generate a finite charge current .",
    "in contrast , as soon as the load s resistance is finite , the charge current @xmath151 must flow against a finite voltage bias , @xmath64 , then work must be performed on the load .",
    "it would be natural to assume that this work must be provided by the thermal reservoirs , i.e. that the charge current @xmath151 can only flow if @xmath152 .",
    "however , something completely different can be observed in the results in sec .",
    "[ sect : finite - power ] : there we show that finite power can be generated even when @xmath81 .",
    "we call this _ exotic _ power generation .",
    "we observe that the power generated is equal to the heat absorbed by dot m from reservoirs l and r , as there is no heat flow into dot m from anywhere else when @xmath81 .",
    "thus the dot is sucking heat from these reservoirs ( which are both at the same temperature ) , to turn it into useful work .",
    "this obeys the first law of thermodynamics ( energy conservation ) , but  if we ignore the presence of reservoirs h and c  it appears to violate the second law , since it reduces the entropy of reservoirs l and r.    however , if we now turn to reservoirs h and c , we see that there is a heat flow from hot to cold , and this increases the total entropy involved . an elegant way to verify this is the prove in ref",
    ".  @xcite that any such master equation respects the laws of thermodynamics , thus we know that the four reservoirs and three dots together do produce entropy .",
    "what is more , one can rewrite the total rate of entropy production , @xmath153 , as @xmath154 now , since we know that @xmath155 for our system , see also fig .  [ fig : entropy ] , one knows that @xmath156 hence , the second law allows the power generated , @xmath7 , to be finite and positive , even if @xmath81 , as long as @xmath78 is finite and positive .",
    "the entropy increase in reservoir c compensates for the reduction of entropy in the other reservoirs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : entropy ] ) .",
    "thus the apparent paradox is resolved by the fact the power generation has a non - local nature .",
    "the entropy generation caused by the heat flow between one pair of reservoirs ( h and c ) enables the conversion of heat into work at another pair of reservoirs ( l and r ) , even though there is no heat ( or energy ) flow between these two pairs of reservoirs and even though they can be arbitrarily far apart .",
    "a `` poetic '' way of expressing this non - locality is to say that there is a spatial separation of first and second laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the thermocouple manifests the first law by converting heat in reservoirs l and r into work . at the same time ,",
    "some distance away , entropy is being generated by the flow of heat from reservoirs h and c , manifesting the second law . while we have shown that this behaviour is not paradoxical",
    ", it certainly is exotic !",
    "transport through capacitively coupled quantum dots in multiterminal conductors has been measured  @xcite .",
    "the effect of large charging energies on the thermoelectric response of small tunnel junctions  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite is well - known experimentally  @xcite .",
    "our proposed device is close to those very recently realized in experiments  @xcite , in which a quantum dot generates a charge current between two reservoirs ( l and r ) by the rectification of thermal fluctuations in a third capacitatively - coupled reservoir ( the heat source ) . in those systems , it is likely that the dot with tunnel - coupling to reservoirs l and r also has at least a weak capacitative coupling to thermal fluctuations in its cold environment ( including reservoirs l and r ) .",
    "thus , these experimental systems have a strong similarity with the four - terminal set - up that we discuss .",
    "however , to unambiguously show the exotic power generation experimentally , it would be desirable to have a more controlled coupling to the cold environment .",
    "this could be done by capacitatively coupling a third dot to the systems in refs .",
    "@xcite , which we believe is achievable with the technologies used in those works .",
    "more challenging will be to show experimentally that @xmath81 , for this it will be crucial to measure the heat currents accurately .",
    "for this , the capacitive coupling to the heat source and sink permits the different charge fluctuations to be resolved experimentally  @xcite",
    ". therefore , @xmath157 and @xmath158 can be measured  @xcite , so it would be possible to verify that a finite charge current @xmath151 flows when the condition @xmath8 is met .",
    "it is already possible to manipulate locally the temperature of the reservoirs  @xcite , thus getting a knob for controlling the heat currents and ensuring @xmath8 .",
    "our quantum dot model differs from that of a conventional thermocouple in a number of ways ; such as the fact that dot m has discrete states and that it is in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "yet , we claim that the exotic power generation is the consequence of the non - thermal nature of the distribution in dot m , rather than one of the other properties of the dot .",
    "to verify this , we model the thermalization processes within dot m phenomenologically , by considering an additional probe reservoir ( p ) , which is tunnel - coupled to dot m , as indicated in fig .",

    "there is no unique way of defining such a temperature , however a natural way to do so is to say it is the temperature that a probe would measure if placed in thermal contact with the dot @xcite . as such , we can use probe reservoir p considered in the previous section in the limit of very weak coupling to the dot ( @xmath185 ) , so it has negligible effect on dot - m s state .",

    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite argued that for having a meaningful definition of @xmath187 , it is crucial that the probe s coupling to the dot is the same at all energies , so the probe is sensitive to the whole energy distribution of the dot .",

    "our system can supply electrical power to a load .",
    "surprisingly , this can be done also in configurations in which no net heat is absorbed from the thermal reservoirs .",
    "this exotic power generation can be explained in terms of non - local coulomb heat drag in which the heat flow from the hot to the cold reservoir induces both a heat and a charge flow in the capacitively coupled electronic circuit .",
    "this effect should be realizable in systems very close to those in recent experiments  @xcite , as outlined in sec .",
    "[ sect : expt ] .",
    "we argue that this exotic power generation relies on the fact that quantum dot m is maintained in an non - thermal state , by showing that it disappears when relaxation effects destroy the non - thermal state . as such it can not occur in a conventional macroscopic thermocouple heat - engine .",
    "we compare our quantum dot thermocouple to its macroscopic equivalent , and find that avoiding the thermalization of carriers can help to improve the thermoelectric performance . in particular , the generated power can be larger than that of any macroscopic thermocouple , even when the latter works with carnot efficiency . in the long term , we hope that this observation will be applied in thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications , since in both cases a large part of the heat flowing into the central region of the thermocouple ( or the central region of the p - n junction in photovoltaics ) flows out again into the cold environment , without contributing to the power generation .",
    "it would be a great benefit if a part of this `` lost '' energy flow could be used to make electrical power in the manner presented here .",
