    "a few years ago this molecule was tentatively identified in the carbon star envelope irc  + 10216 .",
    "the identification was based on the @xmath1 rotational transition , lying at 266.9 ghz , which however appeared contaminated by a narrow line assigned to sis in its @xmath6 vibrational state @xcite .",
    "an emission feature attributable to the @xmath1 line of ph@xmath0 was also observed independently by @xcite in the spectra of irc  + 10216 and the carbon - rich envelope crl  2688 .",
    "the observation of just one line , affected by blending in the case of irc  + 10216 , led to consider the detection of ph@xmath0 as tentative . here",

    "h__erschel , which definitively confirms the identification of phosphine in this source .",
    "this is the first time that ph@xmath0 is unambiguously observed outside the solar system .",
    "the hifi observations of irc  + 10216 were obtained in may and from october to december 2010 , in the context of two gt1 programmes dedicated to perform a line survey in all hifi bands and to search for light hydrides at selected frequencies .",
    "data were taken in double beam - switching mode with a spectral resolution of 1.1 mhz and a channel spacing of 0.5 mhz , and processed using the standard herschel pipeline up to level 2 , which provides fully calibrated spectra in the antenna temperature scale .",
    "the intensity scale was later on transformed to main beam brightness temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the local oscillator was shifted in frequency to identify any emission arising from the image band .",
    "spectra were smoothed to a spectral resolution of 1.5 mhz . for details about the data reduction we refer to @xcite .    phosphine was searched for in irc  + 10216 with hifi through its @xmath2 and @xmath8 rotational transitions .",
    "this molecule is an oblate symmetric rotor and thus its rotational levels are defined by the quantum numbers @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and radiative transitions are only allowed within levels of the same @xmath10 ladder .",
    "the @xmath10 ladders are grouped into two distinct forms : ortho and para , between which radiative and collisional transitions are severely forbidden .",
    "the rotational spectrum of ph@xmath0 has been extensively studied in the laboratory and line frequencies are accurately known @xcite .",

    "the spectrum , smoothed to a spectral resolution of 1.5 mhz , shows also three lines of sic@xmath5 @xmath13 and one line of @xmath14sis .",
    "thick gray lines are the line profiles calculated with the lvg model ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the central peak observed in the @xmath1 line , not accounted for by the model , is probably due to a non optimal substraction of the sis @xmath6 overlapping line . ]    the @xmath2 rotational transition of ph@xmath0 consists of two @xmath10 components : 2@xmath15 at 533.7946 ghz and 2@xmath16 at 533.8153 ghz .",

    "the @xmath7 rms noise level is 0.0024 k per 1.5 mhz channel .",
    "there is an emission feature with @xmath7 @xmath170.01 k centered at 533.8 ghz which can be clearly identified with a composite of the two @xmath10 components of the @xmath2 transition of ph@xmath0 .",
    "we have verified that there is no other obvious assignment for this emission feature by looking at the spectral catalog of madex @xcite .",
    "each of the two @xmath10 components has a linewidth consistent with an expansion velocity @xmath18 of 14.5 km s@xmath19 , as most of lines arising from the outer envelope in irc  + 10216 @xcite , including the line previously observed with the iram 30-m telescope and assigned to the @xmath1 transition of ph@xmath0 ( see lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : lines ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum around 533.8 ghz also shows three narrow lines , with @xmath18 @xmath178 - 10 km s@xmath19 , arising from sic@xmath5 in its @xmath13 vibrational state and one from @xmath14sis .",
    "lines from these species have been already observed in irc  + 10216 at millimeter wavelengths @xcite and are also detected across the hifi spectral scan .    the @xmath8 transition of ph@xmath0 lying at 800.5 ghz is not detected because the sensitivity of the hifi spectrum at these frequencies is not good enough .",
    "the @xmath7 rms noise level is 20 mk per 1.5 mhz channel and this ph@xmath0 line is expected to have a @xmath7 of some mk .",
    "moreover , even if the sensitivity were much better , the detection of this line would be hampered by the fact that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components , at 800.4562 ghz and 800.4871 ghz , would appear severely blended with two strong lines from sic@xmath5 ( 34@xmath20 - 33@xmath21 and 34@xmath21 - 33@xmath22 at 800.4842 ghz and 800.4907 ghz ; @xcite ) . intense lines from warm sic@xmath5 are numerous across the whole hifi spectrum @xcite",
    ". the @xmath23 component of ph@xmath0 , at 800.5799 ghz , does not overlap with these sic@xmath5 lines ( linewidths in irc  + 10216 s spectra at these frequencies are @xmath1780 mhz ) and thus would be observable if the sensitivity were good enough .",
    "the detection of the @xmath2 transition of ph@xmath0 with hifi , together with the previous detection of the @xmath1 line @xcite , definitively confirms the identification of ph@xmath0 in irc  + 10216 .",
    "the non detection of the @xmath8 line in our hifi data is consistent with the line intensities of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines , and thus with the identification of ph@xmath0 .",
    "to extract information about the abundance , spatial distribution , and excitation of ph@xmath0 in the envelope of irc  + 10216 the observed lines must be confronted with the results of excitation and radiative transfer calculations . here",
    "the calculations are based on a multi - shell lvg formalism and the model of the envelope adopted is that of @xcite . basically , it consists of an agb star surrounded by a spherically expanding envelope of gas and dust .",
    "the adopted distance and mass loss rate are 130 pc and 2 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath26 yr@xmath19 , and dust is assumed to condense at a radius of 5 @xmath3 .",
    "the stellar properties , radial profiles , and dust parameters are described in @xcite . in the innermost layers ( @xmath275 @xmath3 ) , we have adopted the downward revision of the density of particles derived by @xcite from alma observations of hnc in various excited vibrational states .",
    "energy levels and transition frequencies of ph@xmath0 in its ground vibrational state were computed from the rotational constants reported by @xcite .",
    "line strengths for pure rotational transitions were computed from the dipole moment measured by @xcite .",
    "both ortho and para forms of ph@xmath0 were considered with the statistical ortho - to - para ratio of 1 . since rate coefficients for collisional excitation of ph@xmath0 with h@xmath5 or he are not known , we adopted those computed for nh@xmath0 @xcite , properly corrected to the case without inversion doubling .",
    "scaling of the rate coefficients due to the mass change from nh@xmath0 to ph@xmath0 is very small ( @xmath275 % ) and was thus not considered .",
    "no extrapolation in temperature was done , and thus the rate coefficients at 300 k , the highest temperature available in the quantum calculations of nh@xmath0 , were adopted at higher temperatures .",
    "the use of these rate coefficients is probably the major source of uncertainty introduced in the excitation calculations .",
    "we included rotational levels up to @xmath28 for the ortho species and @xmath29 for para ph@xmath0 , the highest levels involved in the quantum calculations of the collisional rate coefficients for nh@xmath0 .",
    "infrared pumping to excited vibrational states was taken into account by including the first excited states of the four vibrational modes @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , lying at 2321 , 992 , 2327 , and 1118 cm@xmath19 , respectively , over the ground state .",
    "spectroscopic constants and band intensities were taken from laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "the fundamental bands of these modes lie at 4.3 , 9 , and 10 @xmath35 m , wavelengths at which the flux in the envelope of irc  + 10216 is large @xcite .",
    "collisional rates for ro - vibrational transitions were assumed to be negligible compared with radiative rates .",
    "the spatial distribution of phosphine in the envelope of irc  + 10216 is uncertain because the observed line profiles provide just limited information . in the case of the @xmath1 line",
    ", the substration of the blended line of sis @xmath6 introduces an important uncertainty on the real shape of the ph@xmath0 contribution .",
    "the profile of the @xmath2 line is complicated by the overlap of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 components and the limited signal - to - noise ratio . in any case",
    ", the ph@xmath0 lines observed show a width consistent with an expansion velocity of 14.5 km s@xmath19 , which indicates that an important part of the ph@xmath0 emission comes from regions where the gas has already reached the terminal expansion velocity of the envelope . whether phosphine is formed close to the star or farther out in the envelope is unknown , although there are reasons to suspect that it is not formed too close to the star . on the one hand",
    "the abundance of ph@xmath0 predicted at thermochemical equilibrium in the hot and dense surroundings of the star is negligible , @xmath2710@xmath36 relative to h@xmath5 @xcite . on the other , infrared observations rule out the presence of an important amount of the related molecule nh@xmath0 inside a radius of @xmath1720 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite here we assume that ph@xmath0 is formed at an inner radius of 20 @xmath3 .",
    "the outer boundary is calculated with a photochemical model in which ph@xmath0 is photodissociated by the external uv field using the rate guessed by @xcite .",
    "we find that to reproduce the observed lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ) we need a ph@xmath0 abundance of 10@xmath4 relative to h@xmath5 , which is just slightly higher than the value previously derived by @xcite from the @xmath1 line .",
    "the adopted abundance profile is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] .    .",
    "phosphine is assumed to be present from 20 r@xmath37 with an abundance of 10@xmath4 relative to h@xmath5 and to decrease in the outer layers due to photodissociation by interstellar uv photons .",
    "lower panel : velocity - integrated intensity computed as a function of the impact parameter for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines of ph@xmath0 .",
    "the integration over impact parameter ( if expressed as angular distance in radians ) of the magnitude plotted in the ordinate axis yields the calculated value of @xmath38@xmath7@xmath39 .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the region inner to 20 @xmath3 .",
    "the two panels share a common abscisa axis . ]",
    "various conclusions can be drawn from a careful inspection to the excitation and radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the first is that infrared pumping to excited vibrational states plays an important role in the excitation of ph@xmath0 in the envelope .",
    "it increases the excitation temperature of rotational transitions within the ground vibrational state , and therefore their line intensities , especially the @xmath2 and higher @xmath9 transitions , and extends the emitting region of the lines to larger radii .",
    "this can be appreciated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] , where we show the contribution to the velocity - integrated line intensity of rays arising at each impact parameter .",
    "it can be seen that the bulk of the emission in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines comes from regions with impact parameters from the star between 1@xmath40 and 6@xmath40 .",
    "that is , the emission size of the @xmath1 line is of the order of the main beam of the iram 30-m telescope ( 9.2@xmath40 at 266.9 ghz ) while the @xmath2 line is highly diluted in the main beam of hifi ( 40@xmath40 at 533.8 ghz ) .",
    "we can also appreciate that the observed lines of ph@xmath0 do not trace the regions inner to 20 @xmath3 .",
    "even if we extended phosphine down to the stellar photosphere , the contribution of impact parameters shorter than 20 @xmath3 to the velocity - integrated line intensities would be less than 5 % .",
    "in fact , our lvg calculations indicate that the observed lines are compatible with ph@xmath0 being formed anywhere between the stellar surface and @xmath17100 r@xmath37 .    assuming that the elemental abundance of phosphorus in irc  + 10216 is solar ( p / h = 2.6 @xmath24 10@xmath41 ; @xcite ) , it turns out that hcp locks 5 % of phosphorus @xcite while ph@xmath0 takes 2 % .",
    "it is likely that the rest of p is in some condensed form taking part of dust grains . in envelopes around",
    "other evolved stars gas phase molecules seem to lock a greater fraction of phosphorus than in irc  + 10216 . around half of p",
    "is in the form of hcp and ph@xmath0 in the carbon - rich envelope crl  2688 @xcite , while in oxygen - rich objects po and pn contain a good fraction of the available p , around 1/4 in vy cma @xcite and essentially all available phosphorus in ik tau @xcite .    in irc",
    "+ 10216 phosphine is formed somewhere between 1 and 100 @xmath3 from the star , although it is not clear which is the main formation mechanism .",
    "thermochemical equilibrium calculations indicate that its abundance in the surroundings of the star is very low ( @xmath2710@xmath36 relative to h@xmath5 ) and gas phase chemical kinetics models yield no net formation in the outer layers of the envelope @xcite .",
    "there are various plausible non - equilibrium processes at work in the inner envelope , which may be at the origin of ph@xmath0 and other hydrides such as nh@xmath0 and h@xmath5o , for which thermochemical equilibrium predicts abundances much lower than observed .",
    "interestingly , the nh@xmath0/ph@xmath0 abundance ratio in irc  + 10216 ( @xmath17200 ; @xcite ) is similar to the solar elemental n / p abundance ratio , indicating that a similar fraction of n and p are locked in nh@xmath0 and ph@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "a non equilibrium chemistry driven by shocks induced by the stellar pulsation has been proposed as a source of water vapour in irc  + 10216 @xcite . in this scenario , however , nh@xmath0 is formed with a very low abundance and details on whether or not ph@xmath0 is formed are not provided .",
    "another mechanism proposed for the formation of hydrides such as h@xmath5o and nh@xmath0 in the inner layers of carbon - rich envelopes such as irc  + 10216 is photochemistry driven by the penetration of interstellar uv photons across the clumpy envelope @xcite . in this scenario ph@xmath0",
    "is not efficiently formed although it is likely due to the lack of relevant chemical kinetics data for phosphorus species .",
    "another possible source of hydrides such as ph@xmath0 , yet to be explored , could be provided by chemical reactions taking place on dust grain surfaces .",
    "which of these mechanims , if any , is responsible for the formation of ph@xmath0 in the ejecta of evolved stars such as irc  + 10216 has yet to be investigated .",
    "we use the hifi instrument on board _ _ h__erschel to observe the @xmath2 line of ph@xmath0 in irc  + 10216 , which together with the previous observation of the @xmath1 line with the iram 30-m telescope , definitively confirms the first identification of ph@xmath0 outside the solar system .",
    "excitation and radiative transfer calculations indicate that the observed lines are consistent with phosphine being formed in the circumstellar envelope anywhere between 1 and 100 @xmath3 from the star with an abundance of 10@xmath4 relative to h@xmath5 .",
    "the detection of ph@xmath0 challenges chemical models as no obvious formation route has for the moment been found .",
    "prospects to put further constraints on the distribution and origin of ph@xmath0 in irc  + 10216 with telescope facilities such as alma seem challenging .",
    "the @xmath1 line being blended with a sis @xmath6 line , it makes complicated to disentangle the contribution from each line to the spatial distribution of the emission .",
    "the @xmath2 line at 533.8 ghz can not be reached from ground because of the terrestrial atmospheric opacity , and the @xmath8 line is also severely blended with a strong line of sic@xmath5 . although ph@xmath0 locks a minor fraction of phosphorus in irc  + 10216 , it is together with hcp , one of the major gas phase carriers of phosphorus in the inner circumstellar layers , suggesting that it could be also an important phosphorus species in other astronomical environments .",
    "observations of ph@xmath0 in sources other than irc  + 10216 , such as crl  2688 , may help to better understand its formation and the implications for the chemistry of phosphorus in space .",
