    "for nematics made of small molecules , the viscoelastic effects and the nonlinear effects are usually believed to be not important .",
    "hence , the flow of nematics can be described by the ericksen - leslie theory@xcite , where the dissipative part of the stress tensor depends linearly on the strain rate . in this respect , nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) are non - newtonian fluids only because of their anisotropic dissipation , while they show no static elastic anisotropy , no shear stiffness and their viscous coefficients do not depend on frequency .",
    "the dissipation function is thus quadratic in the velocity gradient , like in ordinary fluids .",
    "elasticity appears only when director distortions are taken into account and the free energy is then supplemented with frank s elastic energy .    however , this description is correct only at low - frequencies , i.e. , for small strain rates .",
    "actual soft matters are usually viscoelastic : they have both viscosity and bulk elasticity , and the relation between the stress and strain ( or strain rate ) is nonlinear .",
    "viscoelastic features emerge also in nematic liquid crystals at ultrasonic frequencies .",
    "for instance , the anisotropy of sound speed and attenuation and their frequency dependence is often described in terms of an elastic material response and relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "structural relaxation processes are also explicitly mentioned in order justify the frequency dependence of the viscosity coefficients @xcite .",
    "recent papers even report the measurement of a viscoelastic response in low molecular weight liquid crystals , either in the nematic or the isotropic phase , when they are subjected to low - frequency mechanical sinusoidal deformations @xcite .",
    "while this ideas seem to be in good agreement with experiments they do not fit well with the existing hydrodynamic theories@xcite .",
    "a comprehensive description of these phenomena along these lines of thoughts has only recently appeared @xcite .",
    "the theory put forth in refs.@xcite has the advantage to enable a smooth transition from liquidlike to solidlike response .",
    "it is characterized by an anisotropic neo - hookean contribution to the strain energy and an evolution of the relaxed ( shear - stress free ) configuration . in the two earlier papers @xcite ,",
    "we have constructed a simplified theory for ( slightly ) compressible nlcs and applied it , with fair success , to explain quantitatively the anisotropy of sound velocity @xcite and sound attenuation @xcite in @xmath0-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline ( mbba ) over the range 214 mhz . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", we have refined our theory to include the anisotropy of the dissipation tensor .",
    "the low - frequency limit of our theory reproduces the classical incompressible ericksen - leslie theory , but delivers in addition a new parodi - like relation among the viscosity coefficients .",
    "although it has long been recognized that sound propagation is affected by the orientational order@xcite , the study of acoustic phenomena in nlcs is still an active field of research @xcite .",
    "to some extent , this is due to the potential theoretical implications as there is not a broad agreement about the theoretical explanation of the interaction of sound and nematic order .",
    "some time ago , a theory of sound propagation has been proposed by selinger and co - workers to explain their experimental results @xcite .",
    "they postulated that the sound - speed anisotropy is due to a direct coupling between the nematic director and the density gradient .",
    "later , this idea has been refined by virga @xcite who has developed a thorough theory of anisotropic korteweg ( or second - gradient ) fluids .",
    "however , here we do not share the point of view reported in @xcite and we have expressed our concerns in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the second - gradient theory does not seem to predict the correct frequency dependence of the sound speed @xcite .    in this paper , we reconsider and extend the model put forth in @xcite , to include the combined effects of ( i ) compressibility , ( ii ) an _ anisotropic neo - hookean _ contribution to the strain energy , and ( iii ) an _ anisotropic _ gradient flow dynamics for the relaxed configuration .",
    "the acoustic approximation allows us to show that there are only four possible relaxation times .",
    "we calculate how the sound speed and the acoustic attenuation depend on these characteristic times and on the angle between the director and the direction of propagation .",
    "the weak - flow approximation yields the explicit dependence of the viscosity coefficients ( including the bulk viscosities ) on the parameters of the model .",
    "we now review the main features of the theory presented in @xcite .",
    "we revise it and extend it to take explicitly into account compressibility and the full spectrum of possible shear rates .",
    "furthermore , we analyze more carefully the relaxation modes allowed by symmetry .    the first key idea is to decouple the contribution of elasticity and dissipation by writing a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient @xmath1 ( with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference configuration , @xmath2 ) @xmath3 the _ effective deformation tensor _ , @xmath4 , will measure the _ elastic response _ of the nlc , from an _ evolving equilibrium configuration _ , @xmath5 . the _ relaxing deformation tensor _",
    ", @xmath6 , determines how this configuration locally departs from the reference configuration .",
    "since the elastic response is determined by @xmath4 , only the effective deformation appears explicitly in the strain energy .",
    "by contrast , energy dissipation ( entropy production ) is only associated with the evolution of @xmath6 .        in order to account for anisotropic elasticity ,",
    "we introduce the following compressible anisotropic neo - hookean _ strain energy density _ per unit mass @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density , @xmath9 is the shear modulus , @xmath10 is the _ effective _ left cauchy - green deformation tensor and @xmath11 is the identity tensor .",
    "the isotropic contribution @xmath12 penalizes density ( and volume ) variations and it is assumed to dominate the elastic energy .",
    "this term depends on @xmath8 and is thus not affected by stress relaxation . by contrast , the second term in depends on the evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "it couples the elastic properties of the material with the nematic director and it is minimum if and only if @xmath13 coincides with the _ energetic shape tensor _",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nematic director and @xmath16 is a density - dependent aspect ratio .",
    "the shape tensor @xmath17 is symmetric , positive definite , and with unit determinant . if nematic distortions have to be included into the model , eq .",
    "must be supplemented with the classical oseen - frank free - energy density @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the director field , @xmath15 , is uniform and fixed by some external action .    a standard procedure @xcite then yields the cauchy stress tensor @xmath18 where the pressure - like function is @xmath19 .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq : pressure}\\ ] ] as expected , when @xmath20 , the shear stress vanishes and @xmath21 is spherical .",
    "the dynamics of the liquid crystal is governed by the balances of mass , momentum and angular momentum at each point of the system .",
    "given our assumption on the director field , the macroscopic motion of the nlc is completely described by the balance of mass and the balance of momentum . in the absence of body forces and body couples these two equations are @xmath22 here , a superimposed dot indicates the material time derivative and @xmath23 is the velocity field .",
    "however , a full description of the dynamics requires an evolution equation for the relaxing deformation@xcite .",
    "any relaxation dynamics necessarily obeys a dissipation inequality , ensuring a non - negative entropy production .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the _ co - deformational derivative _",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spatial velocity gradient .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 can be interpreted as the time rate of change of @xmath13 relative to a convected coordinate system that moves and deforms with the flowing liquid crystal . in this respect , @xmath26 vanishes whenever the deformations are purely elastic and there is no evolution of the natural configuration ( the system does not dissipate ) .",
    "the `` driving force '' for the evolution of @xmath5 is @xmath27 . in this notation",
    ", the dissipation inequality for an isothermal process simply reads @xcite @xmath28 when eq .",
    "is substituted into this inequality takes the form @xmath29 where we have neglected a constant factor .",
    "the simplest ( yet non - trivial ) way to satisfy it is to assume that there is a symmetric positive definite fourth - rank _ dissipation tensor _ @xmath30 , such that the evolution of the natural configuration is governed by the following gradient - flow equation @xmath31",
    "it is natural to assume that the dissipation tensor must share the uniaxial symmetry of the shape tensor . the most general matrix representation of a symmetric fourth - rank tensor that is transversely isotropic about @xmath15 has five independent parameters @xcite .",
    "we interpret @xmath32 as an automorphism of the space of symmetric double tensors , @xmath33 .",
    "it is then natural to choose the following basis of @xmath33    @xmath34    [ eq : basee ]    which is adapted from the orthonormal standard basis ( @xmath35,@xmath36,@xmath15 ) of @xmath37 , where the @xmath38-axis is chosen along the director : @xmath39 .",
    "the basis @xmath40 is orthonormal with respect to the dot product between double tensors , defined as @xmath41 for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 in @xmath33 .",
    "it will be apparent , when we study the propagation of an acoustic wave , that the relaxation times are not directly related to @xmath30 but rather to the eigenvalues of the fourth - rank tensor @xmath44 , defined as @xmath45 where the tensor ( or kronecker ) product between two double tensors is a fourth - rank tensor such that @xmath46 and then we extend its definition by linearity . the tensor @xmath44 should be compatible with the uniaxial symmetry about @xmath15 , but it is not necessary symmetric with respect to the scalar product .",
    "on the contrary , it must have a non - vanishing skew - symmetric part to provide the symmetry of @xmath30 .",
    "however , @xmath44 is _ symmetric _ with respect to the scalar product @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 in @xmath33 . is well defined when @xmath16 since the tensor @xmath49 is then positive definite and symmetric ] in fact , it is easy to check that @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the spectral theorem to diagonalize @xmath44 .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath44 are orthogonal with respect to @xmath47 . to further illustrate this point ,",
    "let us introduce a @xmath47-orthonormal basis , derived from @xmath40 , which explicitly embeds the shape tensor @xmath17    @xmath51    [ eq : basel ]    the most general relaxation tensor @xmath44 that shares the symmetry of the shape tensor @xmath17 may be parameterized by five scalar coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . its matrix representation using the basis @xmath57 is @xmath58 where for compactness we have introduced the notation @xmath59 the relaxation times @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the eigenvalues of @xmath44 , while @xmath56 is the angle between the eigenspace associated to @xmath54 and @xmath60 . if @xmath61 , @xmath62_{{\\mathbf{l}}}$ ] is diagonal .",
    "however , in general , @xmath56 is an additional parameter of the model .",

    "the matrix entries of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath40 are derived from eqs . , and eqs . , @xmath67_{{\\mathbf{e } } } = { \\mathbf{e}}_i \\cdot { \\mathbb{t}}{\\mathbf{e}}_j = \\sum_{p , q}({\\mathbf{e}}_i \\cdot { \\mathbf{l}}_p ) [ t_{pq}]_{{\\mathbf{l } } } \\langle { \\mathbf{l}}_q , { \\mathbf{e}}_j \\rangle .\\ ] ] after some algebraic simplifications , which we omit for brevity ,",
    "we finally obtain the expression of @xmath44 that is convenient to use during the calculations    @xmath68    eq .",
    "can then be inverted to yield the dissipation tensor @xmath69 the mathematical structure described above shows that @xmath30 is positive definite if and only if @xmath44 is positive definite , i.e , if all the relaxation times are strictly greater than zero @xmath70 a condition that it is very natural to take for granted .",
    "when the relaxation mechanisms are much faster then the macroscopic dynamics , the material effectively behaves as a fluid and the model is expected to reduce to the compressible ericksen - leslie theory .",
    "an analysis of this approximation in the incompressible case has been presented in @xcite . here , we revise it to include compressibility .",
    "the characteristic time of deformation is related to the velocity gradient , so that we posit @xmath71 .",
    "this has to be compared with the overall relaxation time , which we can define as @xmath72 .",
    "we want to study the asymptotic approximation of the model in the limit @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a small parameter .",
    "this is a `` weak - flow approximation '' where the material reorganization is much faster than the deformation .",
    "therefore , the effective tensor @xmath13 differs from its equilibrium value only by a small amount @xmath76 by inserting into the evolution equation , to first order we find @xmath77 which yields the following approximation for the stress tensor @xmath78 with @xmath79 the co - deformational derivative of the shape tensor is calculated as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the co - rotational derivative of the nematic director , @xmath82 is the stretching , and @xmath83 is the spin .",
    "we are now in a position to compare our result with the most general linear viscous stress compatible with the nematic structure , as given in the compressible ericksen - leslie theory , namely @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the isotropic pressure function .",
    "after some algebra , the leslie coefficients are identified as follows    @xmath86    @xmath87    [ eq : alphas2 ]    where we have defined @xmath88 .",
    "these viscosity coefficients satisfy identically the well - known parodi relation @xcite @xmath89 and the less obvious identities @xcite @xmath90",
    "in sec.[sec : weak - flow ] we have studied the approximation of our model for weak flows and large deformations .",
    "we now analyze the `` dual '' approximation , where the deformations are small and the nlc is only weakly compressible , but the shear rates are virtually large . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have studied a similar problem , under the simplifying assumption of a single relaxation time and nearly - isotropic shape tensor , i.e. , @xmath91 . here , we reconsider the nematoacoustic problem we have tackled in @xcite but in the more general framework of sec.[sec : dynamics ] , with the four relaxation times allowed by symmetry and arbitrary large anisotropies of the shape tensor .    a plane wave solution is represented by a displacement field of the form    @xmath92    [ eq : ansatz_acoustic ]    where @xmath93 is a complex phase , @xmath94 is a complex wave vector , @xmath95 is the angular frequency , @xmath96 is a dimensionless small parameter that scales the amplitude of the wave , and the vector @xmath97 determines the amplitude and the polarization of the wave ( e.g. , longitudinal / transversal if @xmath97 is parallel / orthogonal to @xmath98 ) .",
    "the real part of @xmath94 is the ordinary wave vector @xmath99 , with @xmath100 a unit vector along the propagation direction .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath94 determines the attenuation of the wave . for later convenience in the calculations",
    ", we will retain the complex notation with the implicit understanding that only the real part of the equations has a physical meaning .    to order @xmath101",
    ", the ansatz implies    @xmath102    [ eq : acoustic_eps1 ]    the density - dependent shape tensor and dissipation tensor are perturbed analogously .",
    "we omit their explicit expressions that can be easily calculated from eqs . , but we write formally @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    our perturbative approach based on small density variations",
    "is particularly suited to analyze the quasi - incompressible response of liquids . in this approximation",
    ", tiny density variations should imply fairly large pressure changes .",
    "specifically , the isotropic pressure function @xmath85 is expanded as @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we recall that @xmath108 is the ( isotropic ) sound speed in ordinary liquids , and @xmath109 is usually referred to as the bulk modulus .",
    "it measures the material response to compression .",
    "the pressure variations are @xmath110 and quasi - incompressibility implies that @xmath111 , i.e , @xmath112 . on the other hand , for the asymptotic procedure to be successful , it is required that @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we assume @xmath114 the evolution equation controls the relaxation mechanisms of the fluids .",

    ", we find @xmath117 where @xmath118 is an unknown tensor to be determined by solving eq .. to first order , and after the transient has died out , this equation yields @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the fourth - rank identity tensor .",
    "this equation clearly shows that the normal modes of relaxation are related to the eigenmodes of the tensor @xmath121 .",
    "the fourth - rank time relaxation tensor is then found to be @xmath122 , in agreement with eq ..    from eqs.- , and eqs.- we readily obtain the stress tensor @xmath21 .",
    "the calculations are straightforward but very lengthy , so they will not be reported here .",
    "they are best automated with a computer algebra software such as mathematica^tm^. however , it is interesting to observe that by comparing the stress tensor @xmath21 with @xmath123 as given in eq .",
    ", we derive the frequency dependence of the leslie viscosities predicted by our model .",
    "the low - frequency limit ( @xmath124 ) coincides with the previous result , which was obtained by quite a different procedure .",
    "we find    @xmath125    @xmath126    [ eq : alpha_acustico ]    where    @xmath127    and @xmath128 , @xmath129 .",
    "the identities and still hold true at any frequency .      in order to investigate the propagation of sound we have to solve the balance of momentum equation ( [ eq : balances]b ) .",
    "in the acoustic approximation , to first order this reads @xmath130 the unknowns of this complex equation are : the amplitude vector @xmath97 that determines the polarization of the sound wave , the sound phase velocity @xmath131 , and the attenuation vector @xmath132 .",
    "however , the solution of eq . is obscured by the fact that the amplitude vector @xmath97 is implicitly contained in the stress tensor . to make the mathematical structure of eq .",
    "more transparent , we observe that @xmath21 depends linearly on @xmath97 so that we can define two double tensors @xmath133 and @xmath134 such that @xmath135 eq .",
    "can now be recast in the form of a complex eigenvalue problem , whose real and imaginary parts are @xmath136 eq . is known as the christoffel equation in the theory of acoustic propagation in solids @xcite .",
    "its real part , eq.([eq : christoffel2]a ) , determines the direction of polarization of the wave and the sound speed .",
    "the imaginary part , eq.([eq : christoffel2]b ) , identifies the attenuation .",
    "the christoffel equation is still too complicated to be solved directly .",
    "one simplifying assumption , very natural in our context , is that the stored energy density is only weakly anisotropic and it is dominated by its first term @xcite . in mathematical terms , we posit that the shear modulus @xmath137 is much smaller than the bulk modulus @xmath109 , so that their ratio is small @xmath138      according to eq.([eq : christoffel2]a ) , the amplitude vector @xmath97 must be an eigenvector of @xmath133 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath133 depends on the wave number @xmath139 , we can determine the sound speed @xmath131 by imposing that @xmath140 is an eigenvalue of @xmath133 .",
    "hence , the equation for the sound speed is @xmath141 which can be solved without a prior knowledge of the polarization @xmath97 . given the weak anisotropy assumption , we look for a solution of eq . in the form of an asymptotic expansion @xmath142 , where @xmath143 .",

    "it is worth noticing that the matrix @xmath133 depends on the wave number @xmath148 , with @xmath149 as given in eq .. to leading order",
    ", we obtain , as expected , purely longitudinal waves , i.e. , @xmath150 .",
    "the small @xmath151-correction to the polarization is orthogonal to @xmath100 and can be calculated explicitly , but its long awkward expression is not particularly illuminating and it will not be reported here for brevity .",
    "finally , the attenuation vector is found by solving eq.([eq : christoffel2]b ) , where @xmath132 enters implicitly into the definition of @xmath134 .",
    "since the wave is longitudinal to leading order , the attenuation vector @xmath132 is such that @xmath152 .",
    "this equation yields @xmath153 where @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the unit vector orthogonal to @xmath100 and that belongs to the plane @xmath156 , such that @xmath157 .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath158    @xmath159    @xmath160",
    "we have developed a viscoelastic theory of nematic liquid crystals that accounts for both elastic and relaxation effects , based only on material symmetry requirements and compatibility with thermodynamics .",
    "the uniaxial symmetry implies that there are only four possible relaxation times .",
    "using a weak - flow approximation , we are able to predict how the eight viscosities of the compressible ericksen - leslie model depend on these relaxation times .",
    "the acoustic approximation of our theory provides a number of further interesting results .",
    "first , we have obtained the frequency dependence of the eight viscosity coefficients , the sound speed and the attenuation .",
    "we have seen that each of these quantities is a superposition of relaxing terms , each of which is associated to a single relaxation time . in particular , according to eqs . , we have modeled nlcs as _ shear - thinning _ fluids : at low shear rates , the shear stress is proportional to @xmath161 , and the viscosity approaches a constant value . at higher shear rates",
    "the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate .",
    "this behavior is observed in most ( but not all ) polymeric liquids @xcite .",
    "secondly , we have found how the sound speed and the acoustic attenuation depend on the angle between the director and the direction of propagation .    in principle , our results are in good qualitative agreement with experiments . in order to make this comparison quantitatively precise ,",
    "it is desirable to fit the experimental measures and thus find the parameters of our model .",
    "however , at the present day , this seems to be an intractable task and only a rough estimate of the parameters can be aimed at .",
    "there are three main reasons for this .",
    "the first reason is theoretical : our theory does not account for partial order and temperature effects .",
    "by contrast , relaxation times , viscosity coefficients and acoustic properties are known to depend on temperature and degree of order .",
    "we plan to extend our theory to include the effects of partial order in a future paper .",
    "for the present purposes , we try to select the experimental data sharing the same degree of order and we obtain a crude reconstruction of the nominal values of nematic viscosities at perfect order @xmath162 from values measured for partially ordered nlcs by replacing each @xmath163 term in the cauchy stress tensor by the corresponding second - moment @xmath164 .      secondly , the experimental data at our disposal are scattered in the literature among various sources from the early 70 s . therefore , usually the experimental settings that we have to cope with , may differ with respect to temperature , sample purity , material degradation , and accuracy of the experimental techniques .",
    "finally , ultrasonic measurements are usually performed on a limited range of frequencies , typically below @xmath165mhz . however , to be able to determine the relaxation times associated with the fast relaxation modes ( @xmath166s ) , we need to study the propagation of sound in the ghz - range .",
    "modern techniques based on brillouin scattering seem to enable the analysis of sound propagation up to tens of ghz . however , we were not able to find such measurements for mbba in the right temperature range .",
    "consistently to what is done in refs.@xcite , we will use what seems to be a reasonably coherent set of data for mbba : ( i ) the shear viscosities as suggested in ref.@xcite ( except for @xmath167 , see @xcite ) , at @xmath168c , corresponding to a degree of order @xmath169 , according to @xcite ; ( ii ) the anisotropic profile of the sound speed at @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173mhz and @xmath168c as given in fig.3 of ref.@xcite ; ( iii ) the attenuation anisotropy as given in fig.2 of ref.@xcite .",

    "<S> nematic liquid crystals exhibit both crystal - like and fluid - like features . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the propagation of an acoustic wave shows an unexpected occurrence of some of the solid - like features at the hydrodynamic level , namely , the frequency - dependent anisotropy of sound velocity and acoustic attenuation . the non - newtonian behavior of nematics also emerges from the frequency - dependent viscosity coefficients . to account for these phenomena </S>",
    "<S> , we put forward a viscoelastic model of nematic liquid crystals , and we extend our previous theory to fully include the combined effects of compressibility , anisotropic elasticity and dynamic relaxation , at any shear rate . </S>",
    "<S> the low - frequency limit agrees with the compressible ericksen - leslie theory , while at intermediate frequencies the model correctly captures the relaxation mechanisms underlying finite shear and bulk elastic moduli . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are only four relaxation times allowed by the uniaxial symmetry . </S>"
