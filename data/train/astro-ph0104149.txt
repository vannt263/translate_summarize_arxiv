    "studies of rotation powered pulsars in the x - ray band give us information of their evolution of magnetospheric activities , surface temperatures , and interaction of the pulsar wind with the surrounding medium ( e.g. , becker & tr@xmath3mper 1997 ; saito 1998 ) .",
    "the most energetic crab - like pulsars with the spin - down power of @xmath4 show x - ray pulsations of magnetospheric origin .",
    "most of them are associated with a supernova remnant and power synchrotron nebulae as a result of shock interaction of the pulsar wind with the ambient medium .",
    "the vela - like pulsars , characterized by their spin - down power of @xmath5 , are embedded in the extended synchrotron nebulae which often makes it difficult to study the neutron star itself .",
    "older and weaker ( @xmath6 ) sources show pulsating blackbody - type spectra below @xmath7  kev , as well as the pulsating power - law type spectra in the hard energy band .",
    "typical objects of this class are the three musketeers , psr  b1055 - 52 , psr  b0656 + 14 , and psr  b0633 + 17 ( geminga ) ( e.g. , finley , @xmath8gelman , & kizilolu 1992 ; greiveldinger , et al .",
    "1996 ; becker , et al .",
    "interestingly , these middle - aged ( @xmath9  yrs ) pulsars convert their spin - down power into high energy @xmath10-ray photons with higher efficiency than in younger pulsars ( e.g. , thompson 1996 ; kifune 1996 )    the source studied herein , , was discovered by the targeted searches for radio pulsars in unidentified _ einstein _",
    "x - ray sources ( zepka , et al . 1996 ) . the pulse period , @xmath11  s , and its derivative",
    ", @xmath12 , give the characteristic age of @xmath13  yrs .",
    "the spin - down power is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star normalized to @xmath16 .",
    "this range of parameters is between the vela - like pulsars and the three musketeers .    in the _ einstein _",
    "ipc data , about 50 photons were detected from the x - ray counterpart of the radio pulsar .",
    "the spectral fit gave a blackbody temperature of @xmath17  kev , an absorption column @xmath18 , and an observed x - ray flux @xmath19 in the @xmath20  kev band ( zepka , et al .",
    "unfortunately , the source was located on the support rib of the ipc field .",
    "this made the source position and source spectra rather uncertain .",
    "later , the source was serendipitously observed in the field of view of _ rosat _  pspc .",
    "spectral analysis gave a best - fit blackbody temperature @xmath21  kev , an absorption column @xmath22 , and an effective radius of the emitting region of approximately @xmath23  km ( zepka , et al .",
    "again , the source was unfortunately shadowed by the detector supporting ribs , making the obtained spectral parameters rather uncertain .",
    "interestingly , it was found that this source might be pulsating in the @xmath10-ray energy band .",
    "zepka , et al .",
    "( 1996 ) folded the arrival times of 267 counts from _ cgro _ egret at the expected pulse period .",
    "they found that the folded light curve was significantly displaced from uniform distribution at more than 99  % confidence .",
    "we have proposed and carried out the _ asca _  observation of during 1998 , october 16 - 18 .",
    "_ asca _  ( tanaka , inoue , & holt , 1994 ) carries two kinds of x - ray detectors at the foci of four identical x - ray telescopes . the x - ray ccd camera , sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; burke , et al .",
    "1994 ) , has the higher energy resolution and relatively high detection efficiency in the soft energy band .",
    "the time resolution of sis is 4 - 16  s in the standard mode which is not suitable for timing observation of fast pulsars . the imaging gas - scintillation proportional counter , gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; ohashi , et al .",
    "1996 ; makishima , et al . 1996 ) , has relatively high detection efficiency in the hard energy band and high time resolution .",
    "we operated the sis in 1-ccd faint mode with 4-s time resolution .",
    "therefore , only pulse phase averaged spectroscopy could be made with the sis .",
    "we operated the gis in the ph mode and assigned a part of the telemetry bit to increase the time resolution reducing the spectral information .",
    "the resultant time resolution was 3.9  ms or better depending on the telemetry rate .",
    "we used screened event data according to the standard rev2 processing ( pier 1997 ) .",
    "the effective exposure time was 69.6 and 76.1  ks for each sis and gis , respectively , and the net time span of observation was @xmath24  ks .",
    "we analyzed the gis data to search for pulsations in the x - ray band .",
    "the gis observation began at 51103.0185  mjd and ended at 51104.8260  mjd .",
    "the data from gis2 and gis3 were co - added , yielding @xmath25 events within 3@xmath26 radius circular region in the total energy band of 0.7 - 7  kev , including background .",
    "the photon arrival times were barycentered and @xmath27 test ( buccheri , et al . 1983 ) and epoch folding search ( e.g. , leahy , et al . 1983 ) were applied bracketing the expected period , @xmath28  s at mjd  51103.9305 ( middle time of the current _ asca _  observation at barycenter ) , from the radio ephemeris effective during the current observation ( nice 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "figure 1a shows the result of @xmath27 test .",
    "we can clearly see a peak at the expected pulse period .",
    "no similar peaks have been found in the background data with better statistics extracted from the same observation .",
    "we then applied the epoch folding search .",
    "the events were folded into 6  bins and @xmath29 values were calculated from each trial period .",
    "a significant peak is found ( figure 1b ) at the period consistent with that obtained from the @xmath27 test .",
    "the probabilities to find higher peaks out of random fluctuations with a single trial are as low as @xmath30 for @xmath27 test and @xmath31 for folding search .",
    "considering the reasonable number of independent trials ( @xmath32 ) as discussed below , the chance probabilities to find higher peaks are @xmath33 for the @xmath27 test and @xmath34 for the folding search .",
    "therefore , we conclude that we have significantly detected x - ray pulsations from  for the first time .    the pulse period is determined from folding search to be @xmath35  s at mjd  51103.9305 . here , the value in parenthesis is a 90  % confidence error to the last digit .",
    "we estimated this error by using the method of leahy ( 1987 ) , which gave tighter constraint than the nominal error of @xmath36  s.    the detected pulse period is consistent with the effective radio ephemeris while it is significantly shorter than the period , @xmath37  s , which is extrapolated from the previous radio ephemeris ( zepka , et al .",
    "1996 ) by @xmath38  s. this difference in period may not be ascribed to a finite value of negative @xmath39 , since the corresponding value of @xmath40 gives an unreasonably large braking index , @xmath41 .",
    "although it is not known if  has recently glitched or not due to lack of published results ( e.g. , johnston & galloway 1999 ) , we consider that the value of @xmath42 is naturally interpreted as the result of glitch activity .",
    "the reasonable number of independent trials for the current timing analysis is then estimated by considering a large glitch of @xmath43 during the 4.3  years between the last published radio observation ( zepka , et al .",
    "1996 ) and the _ asca _  observation .",
    "the largest glitch ever observed would fall within the range considered here ( wang , et al . 2000 ) .",
    "then the number of independent fourier bins covering the period range , @xmath44 , is 18 .",
    "the top panel of figure 2 shows the folded light curves in the total energy band .",
    "the pulse shape is singly peaked and sinusoidal .",
    "the pulse amplitude is @xmath45  % of the source flux excluding background .",
    "comparison has been made of pulse profiles in different energy bands .",
    "the pulse amplitudes , derived by fitting the profiles with a sinusoidal curve , are @xmath46  % and @xmath47  % in 0.7 - 1.9 and 1.9 - 7  kev band , respectively .",
    "we analyzed the pulse phase averaged spectra by using both the sis and gis data .",
    "spectra were extracted from circular regions of @xmath48 radius .",
    "background was subtracted from the same observation . for the sis",
    ", events from the whole chip excluding the circular region of @xmath49 radius around the source were used as background . for the gis",
    ", events from circular regions of @xmath50 radius to the north - east of the source were used as background .",
    "a single power - law function with soft x - ray absorption was first applied for spectrum from each detector .",
    "this simple model gave acceptable fit to each data set and the spectral parameters were found to be consistent with each other within statistical errors .",
    "therefore , we simultaneously fit the two sis and two gis spectra . in the fitting procedure ,",
    "each data point was weighted according to the statistics ( number of photons in each bin ) taking into account the propagation of error due to background subtraction . for clarity ,",
    "figure 3 shows the representative spectra and the best - fit model function for the two detectors ( sis1 and gis3 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are the power - law photon index , @xmath51 , the absorbing hydrogen column density , @xmath52 , and the normalization , @xmath53 at 1  kev with @xmath29/dof=140.6/112 .",
    "these errors are at one parameter 90% confidence .",
    "the observed flux is @xmath54 and the intrinsic flux is @xmath55 , corresponding to the luminosity of @xmath56 , all in 1 - 10  kev range . here , @xmath57 is the source distance normalized to 1  kpc and @xmath58 is the emitting solid angle normalized to @xmath59 steradian .",
    "a single blackbody model with absorption gave the best - fit temperature of @xmath60  kev while the fit was not acceptable with @xmath29/dof=178.9/112 .",
    "since the soft x - ray emission was well fit by a blackbody model ( zepka , et al .",
    "1996 ) , we tried blackbody plus power - law model , modified by a single absorption component . when the blackbody temperature and the normalization were fixed at the best - fit parameters derived from",
    "_ rosat _",
    "pspc , @xmath61  kev and @xmath62  km at 1  kpc , the following parameters are obtained .",
    "the power - law photon index , @xmath63 , the normalization for the power - law component @xmath64 at 1  kev and the absorption column @xmath65 . in this case ,",
    "crossover of the two components occurs at around 1.9  kev .",
    "the quality of the fit is slightly worse than the single power - law model , @xmath66 .",
    "when the emitting radius of blackbody is set free , @xmath67  km is obtained with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "starting with the best - fit parameters for the blackbody component obtained from _ rosat _ , we tried to set all the five parameters free in the two component ( blackbody plus power - law ) model .",
    "however , the parameters could not be well constrained due to trade - offs between the two continuum components and the arbitrary absorption column .",
    "therefore , we fixed the temperature at a value in the range @xmath72 with every 0.01  kev step .",
    "then the minimum of @xmath73 , was obtained with @xmath74  kev and @xmath75  km .",
    "the @xmath29 value with @xmath76  kev is thus smallest and we consider this model is most suitable for the current _ asca _  data .",
    "the other spectral parameters for @xmath76  kev are the power - law photon index , @xmath77 , the normalization for the power - law component @xmath78 at 1  kev and the absorption column @xmath79 . with this model",
    ", the total observed x - ray flux is @xmath80 and the intrinsic flux is @xmath81 in the 1 - 10  kev band .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath82 .",
    "the blackbody component contributes 16  % and 34  % of the observed and intrinsic flux , respectively .",
    "we then examined the pulse phase dependence of spectral shape by using the gis data .",
    "we divided the data into two subsets , pulse on ( high intensity ) phase and pulse off ( low intensity ) phase .",
    "the two phases are split at phase 0.0625 and 0.5625 in figure 2 . since the statistics are limited , we fixed the absorption column at the best - fit value obtained from a single power - law model and fit the spectra with a single power - law function .",
    "the photon indices were @xmath83 and @xmath84 for pulse on and off phases , respectively .",
    "although harder spectrum is suggested for higher flux phase , the photon indices are consistent within statistical errors .",
    "the overall properties of the multi - wavelength spectrum of  from radio to x - ray and @xmath10-ray are similar to those of other @xmath10-ray pulsars ( thompson 1996 ) .",
    "they are radiating a large fraction ( @xmath85 ) of their spin - down power in the @xmath10-ray band .",
    "the x - ray luminosity , @xmath86 , obtained from the two component spectral fit , is @xmath87 of the spin - down power , which is comparable to those of vela pulsar and the three musketeers ( e.g. , saito 1998 ) . for the power - law photon index which smoothly connects the x - ray and",
    "@xmath10-ray flux is @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the simple extension of the x - ray spectrum with the photon index , @xmath89 , obtained from the best power - law plus blackbody model , predicts lower @xmath10-ray flux than observed . this situation may be reconciled with complete pulse phase spectroscopy including appropriate blackbody model , which should be done in future observations .",
    "the observed pulse fraction , 45  % in the 0.7 - 7  kev band , is comparable with @xmath90  % found for psr  b1055 - 52 above 1  kev ( @xmath91gelman & finley 1993 ; figure 1b ) and @xmath92  % found for geminga in 1 - 4  kev band ( halpern & wang 1997 ) . while these values are significantly larger than the pulse fraction of @xmath93  % for psr  b0656 + 14 as measured by _",
    "( finley , et al .",
    "this might be partly due to the energy dependent pulse fraction of psr  b0656 + 14 .",
    "the significant difference between the detected and extrapolated pulse period may be understood as a result of glitch activity .",
    "urama & okeke ( 1999 ) have found that there exists a good correlation between young pulsars spin - down rate and glitch activity .",
    "they predict the interval between vela - size glitches of average @xmath94 to be 7  years for . in terms of the glitch activity parameter @xmath95 , the mean fractional change in period per year owing to glitches ,",
    "the predicted value is @xmath96 ( urama & okeke 1999 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the accumulated period change during the 4.3  yrs of @xmath97 .",
    "these predictions are in good agreement with those observed , @xmath98 or @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , lyne , shemar , & graham - smith ( 2000 ) studied the statistical properties of pulsar glitches by using well - defined sample and found a strong indication that pulsars with large magnetic fields suffer many small glitches while others show a smaller number of large glitches .",
    "comparing the period and its derivative for  with those in their sample , psr  b1758 - 23 , possibly associated with the supernova remnant w28 ( kaspi , et al .",
    "1993 ) , has similar range of parameters .",
    "therefore ,  might have experienced a large number of medium size ( @xmath100 ) glitches as in the case of psr  b1758 - 23 .",
    "lyne et al . ( 2000 ) also found a good correlation between @xmath101 and the glitch spin - up rate , @xmath102 , defined as the cumulative effect of glitch upon the frequency derivative .",
    "the relation , @xmath103 , leads to @xmath104  s for  during the time span of 4.3  yrs , in reasonable agreement with that observed , @xmath105  s.    psr  j0631 + 1036 was first detected in the soft x - ray band , since it is in the direction of the galactic anti - center ( @xmath106 , @xmath107)=(@xmath108 , @xmath109 ) where the interstellar absorption is much smaller than in the galactic plane toward the galactic center .",
    "also , the detection of pulsed x - ray emission could be made only with long exposure time as performed with _",
    "asca _  referring to the previously known radio period .",
    "this lesson suggests that there may be other similar sources hidden in the galactic plane .",
    "combined analyses of radio , x - ray , and unidentified @xmath10-ray sources may be useful ( e.g. , roberts , romani , & kawai 2001 ) .    in summary , we have detected the pulsed x - ray emission from  for the first time .",
    "the negative offset of the observed period from the extrapolated radio ephemeris is attributable to the accumulated change in period due to glitch activity .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well described by a power - law plus blackbody model with observed flux @xmath110 in the 1 - 10  kev band .",
