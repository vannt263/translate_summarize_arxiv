    "although group dynamics has always been a fascinating field of research , many phenomena of collective behavior patterns are still only qualitatively understood . apart from the complexity of social phenomena ,",
    "one serious problem is that many variables ( quantities ) which influence human behavior are hardly measurable .",
    "for this reason pedestrian crowds are an ideal object of social research : all essential quantities like places , speeds , and walking directions of pedestrians as well as locations of obstacles and attractions etc .",
    "can be easily and exactly determined .",
    "moreover , a large amount of data has already been collected @xcite .",
    "pedestrian crowds have been studied for about three decades now @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these studies was to develop guidelines for planning and designing pedestrian facilities .",
    "these have usually the form of regression relations @xcite which are , however , not very well suited for the prediction of pedestrian flows in pedestrian precincts or buildings with an exceptional architecture .",
    "therefore , a number of simulation models have been proposed , e.g. _ queueing models _",
    "@xcite and models for the route choice behavior of pedestrians @xcite .",
    "none of these approaches adequately takes into account the _ self - organization effects _ occuring in pedestrian crowds .",
    "these may , however , lead to unexpected obstructions due to mutual disturbances of pedestrian flows .",
    "the different kinds of spatio - temporal collective patterns of motion formed by pedestrian crowds even have not been investigated in detail yet .",
    "one reason for this may be the sensitive dependence of the emerging pedestrian flows on the geometrical shape of pedestrian facilities .    in the following section we will describe some of our observations concerning pedestrian motion . afterwards a new model for the behavior of pedestrians and their interactions with the developed environment and other pedestrians will be presented . by means of computer simulations",
    "we will demonstrate that this model is able to explain the formation of the observed self - organization phenomena .",
    "finally , it is shown that self - organization effects can be utilized for an optimization of pedestrian flows .",
    "that means , computer simulations like the ones presented can provide a powerful tool for designing and planning pedestrians facilities like subway or railway stations , pedestrian precincts , shopping malls , or big buildings .",
    "we have studied pedestrian motion for several years and evaluated a number of quick - motion video films @xcite . despite the sometimes more or less ` chaotic ' appearance of individual pedestrian behavior , some regularities can be found .",
    "the following results mainly apply to purposeful pedestrians who steer for a certain destination .",
    "they are not valid for aimless pedestrians like tourists who stroll around ( showing other rules of motion , cf .",
    "in addition , children move more irregular than described below since they must learn optimal strategies of motion first which are used more or less automatically later .",
    "our observations can be summarized as follows :    * pedestrians normally choose the shortest route to their next destination which has therefore the shape of a polygon .",
    "if alternative routes have the same length , a pedestrian prefers the one where he / she can go straight ahead as long as possible and change the direction as late as possible provided that the alternative route is not more attractive ( due to less noise , more light , friendlier environment , less waiting time at traffic lights , etc . ) .",
    "a pedestrian feels a strong aversion to taking detours or moving opposite to the desired walking direction even if the direct way is crowded .",
    "* pedestrians prefer to walk with an individual desired speed which corresponds to the comfortable walking speed as long as it is not necessary to move faster in order to reach the destination in time . the desired speeds within pedestrian crowds are gaussian distributed @xcite .",
    "* pedestrians keep a certain distance to other pedestrians and borders ( of streets , walls , and obstacles ) .",
    "this distance is the smaller the more a pedestrian hurries , and it decreases with growing pedestrian density .",
    "+ resting individuals ( waiting on a railway platform for a train , sitting in a dining hall , or lying at a beach ) are uniformly distributed over the available area if there are no aquaintances among the individuals .",
    "pedestrian density increases ( i.e. interpersonal distances lessen ) around particularly attractive places .",
    "it decreases with growing velocity variance ( e.g. on a dance floor , cf .",
    "individuals knowing each other may form groups which are entities that behave similar to single pedestrians .",
    "group sizes are poisson distributed @xcite . *",
    "pedestrians normally do not reflect their behavioral strategy in every situation anew but act more or less automatically ( as an experienced car driver does ) .",
    "this becomes obvious when pedestrians cause delays or obstructions , e.g. by already entering an elevator or underground even though others still try to get off .",
    "additionally , we found that , at medium and high pedestrian densities , the motion of pedestrian crowds shows some striking analogies with the motion of gases and fluids .",
    "this includes    * the similarity of footprints in snow with streamlines of fluids , * the existence of a condensed state of pedestrian crowds in which pedestrians can not move freely any more , * ` viscous fingering ' @xcite at the borderline between opposite streams of motion , * the development of river - like streams through _ waiting _ pedestrian crowds , * and the formation of pedestrian - free bubbles .",
    "the paper will now focus on the explanation of some frequently observable self - organization phenomena which have not been modelled by other theories yet :    * in crowds of pedestrians moving into opposite directions , lanes of uniform walking direction are formed if the pedestrian density exceeds a critical value .",
    "* oscillatory changes of the walking direction develop at narrow passages ( corridors , staircases , or doors ) .",
    "the average oscillation frequency increases with growing width and decreasing length of the passage .",
    "the idea to describe pedestrian crowds by a _ fluid - dynamic _ model goes back to henderson @xcite .",
    "however , since his model bases on unrealistic assumptions like energy and momentum conservation during pedestrian interactions , an improved fluid - dynamic model was proposed @xcite which is derivable from a pedestrian - specific gaskinetic model @xcite .    however , for practical applications a direct simulation of _ individual _ pedestrian behavior is favourable since a numerical solution of the fluid - dynamic equations is very difficult . as a consequence ,",
    "current research concentrates on the _ microsimulation _ of pedestrian crowds . in this connection , a _ social force model _ of individual pedestrian dynamics",
    "was recently suggested @xcite .",
    "a simple forerunner of this kind of model was proposed by gipps and marksj @xcite .",
    "the social force concept of pedestrian motion can shortly be described as follows : pedestrians are _ used _ to the situations they are normally confronted with .",
    "their behavioral strategies are determined by their experience which reaction to a certain stimulus ( situation ) will be the _",
    "best_. therefore , their reactions are usually rather _ ` automatic ' _ and well predictable .",
    "we will see that pedestrian motion can be described as if it would be governed by a ` social force ' . the _ social force _",
    "@xmath0 represents the different influences ( of environment and other pedestrians ) on the behavior of a pedestrian @xmath1 .",
    "it determines the temporal change @xmath2 of his / her _ actual velocity _ @xmath3 together with a _ fluctuation term _ which delineates random behavioral variations ( arising from accidental or deliberate deviations from the usual rules of motion ) : @xmath4 however , in contrast to physical forces , the social force is not excerted on a pedestrian by his / her environment .",
    "instead it reflects the concrete _ psychological motivation _ to act causing pedestrian @xmath1 to produce an acceleration or deceleration force of strength @xmath5 himself / herself .",
    "( for a foundation of the social force concept cf . refs . @xcite . )",
    "the social force @xmath5 consists of several force terms which correspond to the different influences simultaneously affecting the behavior of pedestrian @xmath1 : @xmath6    * each pedestrian wants to walk with an individual _ desired speed _ @xmath7 in the direction @xmath8 of his / her next destination .",
    "deviations of the _ actual velocity _",
    "@xmath9 from the _ desired velocity _",
    "@xmath10 due to disturbances ( by obstacles or avoidance maneuvers ) are corrected within the so - called _ ` relaxation time ' _ @xmath11 : @xmath12 in order to compensate for delays , the desired speed @xmath13 is often increased in the course of time .",
    "* pedestrians keep some distance from borders in order to avoid the risk of getting hurt .",
    "the closer the border is the more incomfortable a pedestrian feels .",
    "this effect can be described by a repulsive force @xmath14 which decreases monotonously with the distance @xmath15 between the place @xmath16 of pedestrian @xmath1 and the nearest piece of the border . in the the simplest case this force can be expressed in terms of a repulsive potential @xmath17 : @xmath18 +",
    "similar repulsive force terms @xmath19 can describe that each pedestrian @xmath1 keeps a situation - dependent distance to the other pedestrians @xmath20 .",
    "this reflects the tendency to respect a _ private sphere ( ` territorial effect ' ) _ and helps to avoid collisions in cases of sudden velocity changes .",
    "* pedestrians show a certain joining behavior .",
    "for example , families , friends , or tourist parties often move in groups .",
    "in addition , pedestrians are sometimes attracted by window displays , sights , special performances ( street artists ) , or unusual events at places @xmath21 .",
    "both situations can be modelled by time - dependent attractive forces @xmath22 in a similar way like the repulsive effects but with an opposite sign .    for a more detailed discussion and the concrete mathematical specification of the force terms",
    "the social force model of pedestrian dynamics has been simulated on a computer for a large number of interacting pedestrians confronted with different situations . despite the fact that the proposed model is very simple",
    "it describes a lot of observed phenomena very realistically . especially , under certain conditions",
    "the _ self - organization _ of collective behavioral patterns can be observed .",
    "` self - organization ' means that these patterns are not externally planned , prescribed , or organized , e.g. by traffic signs , laws , or behavioral conventions . instead , the spatio - temporal patterns emerge due to the non - linear interactions of pedestrians .",
    "our model ( according to which individuals behave rather automatically ) can explain the self - organized patterns described in the following without assuming strategical considerations , communication , or imitative behavior of pedestrians :    * above a critical pedestrian density our simulations reproduce the empirically observed formation of lanes consisting of pedestrians with the same desired walking direction ( cf .",
    "1 ) . these lanes are dynamically varying .",
    "their number depends on the width of the street and on pedestrian density .",
    "+ the conventional interpretation of lane formation assumes that pedestrians tend to walk on the side which is prescribed in vehicular traffic .",
    "however , our model can explain lane formation although it does not assume a preference for _ any _ side ( it is completely symmetrical with respect to the left - hand and the right - hand side ) .",
    "the mechanism of lane formation is that motion is more efficient for a pedestrian who follows other pedestrians with the same walking direction since avoidance maneuvers are less frequently necessary , then . * in our simulations oscillatory changes of the walking direction at narrow passages",
    "are also observed ( cf .",
    "the conventional interpretation for a change of the walking direction is that , after some time , a pedestrian does the kindness of giving precedence to a waiting pedestrian with an opposite walking direction .",
    "this , however , can not explain the increase of oscillation frequency with passage width .",
    "+ the mechanism leading to alternating flows is the following : once a pedestrian is able to pass the narrowing ( door , staircase , etc . ) , pedestrians with the same walking direction can easily follow which is particularly clear for long passages . by this",
    "the number and ` pressure ' of waiting and pushing pedestrians becomes less than on the other side of the narrowing where , consequently , the chance to occupy the passage grows .",
    "this leads to a deadlock situation after some time which is followed by a change of the walking direction .",
    "capturing the passage is easier if it is broad and short so that the walking direction changes more frequently , then .",
    "* at intersections our simulations show the temporary emergence of unstable roundabout traffic with an alternating rotation direction ( cf .",
    "( after the discovery of this effect in our computer simulations it was also empirically confirmed . ) + roundabout traffic is connected with small detours but decreases the frequency of necessary deceleration , stopping , and avoidance maneuvers considerably so that pedestrian motion becomes more efficient on average .",
    "the emerging pedestrian flows decisively depend on pedestrian density and the geometry of pedestrian facilities .",
    "they can be simulated on a computer already in the planning phase of pedestrian facilities .",
    "the configuration and shape of the facilities can be systematically varied ( e.g. by _ evolutionary algorithms _",
    "@xcite ) and evaluated on the basis of particular mathematical _ performance measures_. for example , the _ efficiency measure _ @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the number of pedestrians @xmath1 and the bar denotes a time average ) calculates the mean value of the velocity component into the desired direction of motion in relation to the desired walking speed .",
    "the _ uncomfortableness measure _",
    "@xmath25 reflects the frequency and degree of sudden velocity changes , i.e. the level of discontinuity of walking due to necessary avoidance maneuvers .",
    "hence , the optimal configuration regarding the pedestrian requirements is the one with the highest values of efficiency and comfortableness .    during the optimization procedure , some or all of the following can be varied :    * the location and form of planned buildings , * the arrangement of walkways , entrances , exits , stairs , elevators , escalators , and corridors , * the shape of rooms , corridors , entrances , and exits , * the function and time schedule of room usage .",
    "the proposed optimization procedure can not only be applied to the design of new pedestrian facilities but also to a reduction of existing bottlenecks by suitable modifications . here",
    ", we give two examples :    * a broader door does not necessarily increase the efficiency of pedestrian flow through it .",
    "it may rather lead to more frequent changes of the walking direction which are connected with an increase of deadlook situations .",
    "therefore , two doors are much more efficient than one single door with double width . by self - organization",
    "@xcite each door is used by one walking direction , then ( cf . fig .",
    "* oscillatory changes of the walking direction and periods of standstill in between also occur when different flows _ cross _ each other .",
    "the loss of efficiency caused by this can be reduced by psychological guiding methods or railings initializing roundabout traffic .",
    "roundabout traffic can already be induced and stabilized by planting a tree in the middle of a crossing . in our simulations this increased efficiency up to 13% .",
    "the complex interaction between various flows can lead to completely unexpected results due to the _ non - linearity of dynamics_. ( a very impressive and surprising result of evolutionary form optimization is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) that means , planning of pedestrian facilities with conventional methods can not guarantee the avoidance of big jams , serious obstructions , and catastrophic blockages ( especially in emergency situations ) .",
    "in contrast , a skilful flow optimization not only enhances efficiency but also saves space that can be used for kiosks , benches , or other purposes .",
    "it has been shown that pedestrian motion can be described by a simple social force model for individual pedestrian behavior .",
    "computer simulations of pedestrian crowds demonstrated 1 .  the development of lanes consisting of pedestrians who walk into the same direction , 2 .",
    "oscillatory changes of the walking direction at narrow passages , 3 .",
    "the spontaneous formation of roundabout traffic at crossings .",
    "these spatio - temporal patterns are self - organized .",
    "they arise due to the _ nonlinear interactions _ of pedestrians .",
    "presently , the social force model is extended by a model for the route choice behavior of pedestrians which facilitates the simulation of complex systems of ways . the sequence of destinations a pedestrian visits can be simulated by a _ discrete choice model _ ( cf .",
    "another extension will allow the simulation of _ trail formation _",
    "@xcite .    since the variables of pedestrian motion are easily measurable , pedestrian models are comparable with empirical data",
    ". moreover , the study of pedestrian crowds leads to a deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the self - organization phenomena in social systems .",
    "therefore , pedestrian models are an ideal starting point for the development of quantitative behavioral models concerning group dynamics @xcite , opinion formation @xcite , and other social processes .    20 , chap . 13 .",
