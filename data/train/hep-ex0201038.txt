    "neutrinoless double - beta decay , is a process by which two neutrons in a nucleus beta decay by exchanging a virtual majorana neutrino , and each emitting an electron .",
    "this violates lepton number conservation @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are many reviews on the subject [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "the decay rate for the process involving the exchange of a majorana neutrino can be written as follows : @xmath3 in equation ( 1 ) @xmath4 is the two - body phase - space factor including coupling constants , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fermi and gamow - teller nuclear matrix elements respectively , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the axial - vector and vector relative weak coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is the effective majorana neutrino mass given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the @xmath12 eigenvalue associated with the @xmath13 neutrino mass eigenstate ( @xmath14 for @xmath15 conservation ) , @xmath16 is the @xmath17 matrix element of the transformation between flavor eigenstates @xmath18 and mass eigenstates @xmath19 for left handed neutrinos ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the mass of the @xmath22 neutrino mass eigenstate .",
    "the effective majorana neutrino mass , @xmath23 , is directly derivable from the measured half - life of the decay as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the electron mass .",
    "this quantity derives from nuclear structure calculations and is model dependent as shown later .",
    "the most sensitive experiments thus far utilize germanium detectors isotopically enriched in @xmath27 from @xmath28 abundance to @xmath29 .",
    "this activity began with natural abundance @xmath30 detectors by fiorini et al ; in milan @xcite evolving over the years to the first experiments with small isotopically enriched @xmath31 detectors @xcite , and finally to the two present multi - kilogram isotopically enriched @xmath32 experiments : heidelberg moscow @xcite and igex @xcite .",
    "these experiments have achieved lower bounds on the half - life of the decay @xmath33",
    "@xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite has about four times the exposure as reference @xcite with data of similar quality .",
    "this strongly implies that these experiments with the order of @xmath36 moles of @xmath32 each are have reached their point of diminishing returns .",
    "their continuation will yield little more information of fundamental interest .",
    "the latest large - space shell model calculation yields @xmath37@xcite .",
    "this value implies that the above half - lives yield @xmath38 .",
    "other calculations , discussed later , yield values as small as @xmath39 .    where should the field of @xmath40 - decay go from here ?",
    "suppose we consider the observed neutrino oscillations in the data from atmospheric neutrinos @xcite and solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "considering these data , what probable range of @xmath23 is implied ?",
    "would it be large enough for a direct observation of @xmath41 decay ?",
    "if so , what technique would be the best for a possible discovery experiment ?",
    "how much would such an experiment cost ?",
    "we will address these questions in an effort to demonstrate that cuore , an array of @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 bolometers , is the best approach presently available",
    ". it can be launched without isotopic enrichment nor extensive r & d , and that it can achieve next generation sensitivity .",
    "the superkamiokande data imply maximal mixing of @xmath45 with @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the solar neutrino data from superk and from sno also imply that the small mixing angle solution to the solar neutrino problem is disfavored , so that @xmath48 ( solar ) @xmath49 .",
    "based on these interpretations , one probable scenario for the neutrino mixing matrix has the following approximate form :    @xmath50    the neutrino masses can be arranged in two hierarchical patterns in which @xmath51 @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . with the available data ,",
    "it is not possible to determine which hierarchy , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , is the correct one , nor do we know the absolute value of any of the mass eigenstates .",
    "the consideration of reactor neutrino and atmospheric neutrino data together strongly implies that the atmospheric neutrino oscillations are very dominantly @xmath56 @xmath57 , which implies , as seen from equation @xcite , that @xmath58 is very dominantly a mixture of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this case",
    "there will be one relative @xmath61 phase , @xmath62 , and equation reduces to the approximate form : @xmath63 where we recall that the large mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem implies @xmath64 this yields four cases to be analyzed : @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 the existence of a mass scale , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "a : :    if @xmath72 , @xmath73 and    @xmath74 .",
    "b : :    if @xmath75 .    @xmath76 or    @xmath77 .",
    "c : :    if @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "d : :    if @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 .",
    "if we assume then that @xmath85 , and that neutrinos are majorana particles , then it is very probable that @xmath86 lies between @xmath87 and the present bound from @xmath32 experiments .",
    "the requirements for a next generation experiment can easily be deduced by reference to equation ( 8) .",
    "@xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of parent nuclei , @xmath90 is the counting time , and @xmath91 is the total number of counts , dominantly background . to improve the sensitivity to @xmath92 by a factor of @xmath93 from the present @xmath94 to @xmath95 , one must increase the quantity @xmath96 by a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "the quantity @xmath89 can feasibly be increased by a factor of @xmath98 , over present experiments so that @xmath99 must also be improved by that amount . since the present counting times are probably about a factor of 5 less than a practical counting time",
    ", the background should be reduced by a factor of between 10 and 20 below present levels .",
    "these are approximately the target parameters of the next generation neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments .",
    "georgi and glashow give further motivation for more sensitive next generation double - beta decay experiments @xcite .",
    "they discuss six `` facts '' deduced from atmospheric neutrino experiments , and from solar neutrino experiments , and the constraints imposed by the reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "they conclude that if neutrinos play an essential role in the large structure of the universe , their six `` facts '' are `` mutually consistent if and only if solar neutrino oscillations are nearly maximal '' .",
    "they further state that stronger bounds on @xmath100 - decay could possibly constrain solar neutrino data to allow only the just - so solution .    if , on the other hand , the small angle msw solution somehow had been the correct one , next generation @xmath41 - decay experiments could `` exclude the cosmological relevance of relic neutrinos '' @xcite .",
    "there are six large volume experimental proposals in various stages of development .",
    "cuore will be discussed in detail later .",
    "the remaining five in alphabetical order are : cameo , exo , genius , majorana , and moon .",
    "the @xmath101 proposal would place enriched parent isotopes in and near the center of the borexino detector and counting test facility @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the proposed @xmath103 detector would be either a large high pressure @xmath104 gas time projection chamber ( tpc ) or a liquid tpc .",
    "it would contain tons of @xmath105 isotopically enriched in @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath106 proposal involves between @xmath107 and @xmath108 of `` naked '' germanium detectors , isotopically enriched to @xmath109 in @xmath110 , directly submerged in a large tank of liquid nitrogen as a `` clean '' shield @xcite .",
    "the @xmath111 proposal is a significant expansion of the igex experiment with new segmented detectors , in a highly dense - packed configuration and new pulse shape discrimination techniques developed by pnnl and usc .",
    "the proposal involves the production of 250 , @xmath112 isotopically enriched @xmath113 detectors , each segmented into 12 electrically independent segments .",
    "the molybdenum observatory of neutrinos ( moon ) proposal is a major extension of the elegants detector .",
    "it involves between 1 and 3 tons of molybdenum foils isotropically enriched to 85% in @xmath114 inserted between plastic scintillators .",
    "all of these experiments will require significant time , r & d , and funding for isotopic enrichment as well as the development of new techniques .",
    "the cuore experiment on the other hand requires no isotopic enrichment because the natural abundance of @xmath1 is @xmath115 , and the technique has already been developed . a preliminary experiment , mibeta ,",
    "has already been completed @xcite .",
    "in addition , a preliminary trial experiment , cuoricino , is being constructed at this time @xcite .",
    "it is one of the 25 towers of 40 of the 1000 , @xmath116 @xmath117 bolometers , which is a slight change in the configuration initially designed @xcite .",
    "cuoricino will contain @xmath118 of @xmath119 .",
    "the most conservative nuclear structure calculations imply that @xmath120 is 2 times more effective in @xmath121 sensitivity than @xmath122 , so that cuoricino will be equal to at least @xmath123 of @xmath30 enriched to 86% in @xmath27 .",
    "cuore would be equivalent to @xmath124 of 86% @xmath27 with the most conservative nuclear matrix elements or 957 @xmath125 of 86% @xmath122 according to the largest theoretical matrix elements .",
    "there are five nuclear structure calculations presented in table 1 below [ 19 - 23 ] .",
    "+   + table 1 : theoretical values of @xmath126 for the double - beta decay of @xmath32 and @xmath127 computed with five nuclear models .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.3 cm    the final spectrum of the mibeta 20 crystal experiment reported in reference @xcite is shown in figure 1 .",
    "while improvements are being made at present in the background as well as in the energy resolution , it is clear that this technology has been clearly demonstrated by the results of the mibeta experiment , and will be further demonstrated by the cuoricino experiment being constructed at this time .",
    "the cuore will consist of an array of 1000 @xmath128 bolometers arranged in a square configuration of 25 towers of 40 crystal each .",
    "the geometry of a single tower is shown in figure 2a .",
    "a sketch of cuore is shown in figure 2b .",
    "the principle of operation of these bolometers is now well understood @xcite .",
    "telurium oxide is a dielectric and diamagnetic crystal , which when maintained at very low temperature @xmath129 has a very low heat capacity .",
    "in fact the specific heat is proportional to the ratio @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the debye temperature .",
    "accordingly , a very small energy absorbed by the crystal by a nuclear decay or recoil by collision , can result in a measurable increase in temperature .",
    "this temperature change can be recorded using neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) germanium thermistors .",
    "these devices were developed and produced by haller at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) and uc berkeley department of material science .",
    "these sensors have been made unique in their uniformity of response and sensitivity by neutron exposure control with neutron absorbing foils accompanying the germanium in the reactor @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 crystals are produced by the shanghai quinhua material company ( sqm ) in shanghai , china .",
    "crystals produced by other organizations have proven to be inferior .",
    "a search of potential suppliers in the u.s . revealed that the only dealers found sold crystals produced by sqm or other companies outside of the u.s .",
    "long periods of operation suffer small excursions in temperature of the crystal array which deteriorates energy resolution .",
    "a stabilization technique proven to be successful in the mibeta 20 crystal array experiment will be employed .",
    "a periodic injection is made of precisely known joule - power directly into the crystals through heavily doped meanders in @xmath132 chips glued to the surface @xcite .",
    "the single tower of 40 crystals is presently under construction .",
    "it will be attached to the mixing chamber of the same dilution refrigerator ( dr ) used in the mibeta experiment @xcite and run as a test .",
    "it will also be run as an experiment called cuoricino which is designed also to improve on the present sensitivity to @xmath23 obtained with isotopically enriched @xmath30 detectors @xcite . by the time significant funding from this proposal",
    "could be spent on cuore , cuoricino will have proven the feasibility of the extension of the mibeta technology to large arrays .",
    "this , plus the fact that cuore requires no isotopic enrichment , puts cuore well ahead of all the other options of a truly next generation @xmath133 experiments . the technology , novel though it is , is developed and to a large degree proven",
    "the cuore array will have @xmath134 nuclei of @xmath1 .",
    "if the background is conservatively reduced to @xmath135 counts @xmath136 , then in one year of running , the sensitivity of cuore would be @xmath137 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath138 .",
    "if eventually , the background would be reduced to 0.001 counts @xmath139 kg / y , the sensitivity with one year of counting would be @xmath140 , corresponding to @xmath141 .",
    "the detector will also be used to search for cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the present thresholds of 5 @xmath145 are equivalent to 1.25 @xmath145 in ordinary @xmath30 detectors , because ionization is 0.26 times as effective in converting nuclear recoil energy into a signal pulse as it is in converting photon energy .",
    "such a large array could efficiently search for a seasonal variation in the cdm interaction rate .",
    "the large mass of @xmath146 theoretically enhances the interaction rate of many cdm candidates .",
    "the cuore crystals will be placed in known crystalline orientations which will allow a sensitive search for solar axions using the technique introduced by creswick et al.@xcite , and demonstrated by the experiment of avignone et al.[32 ] .",
    "it should also be recognized that the highly granular configuration of cuore , equivalent to 10 layers of 100 crystal each , approximately forms a cube with 512 crystals in an inner cube with significant protection from a layer all around of 488 crystals .",
    "the coverage is not perfect because of necessary small spaces between crystals ; however , it will significantly reduce background from gamma - rays coming from outside of the configuration .",
    "finally , while the main emphasis is on building an array of @xmath147 crystals , cuore , or the cuore technique can accommodate any material that can be made into bolometers .",
    "the most promising competing experiments are the two large proposed @xmath27 experiments genius @xcite and majorana @xcite .",
    "the direct observation of neutrinoless double beta decay absolutely requires at least two different experiments with different parent nuclei , if for no other reason than the uncertainties in nuclear matrix elements . in @xmath27 , for example , this results in a factor of 4.3 in the value of @xmath148 , and a factor of 2.4 in the case of @xmath119 .",
    "these uncertainties should be carefully considered when comparing different proposals .",
    "for example , the present bounds on @xmath148 from @xmath27 experiments range from 0.3 to 1.3 @xmath149 , while they range from 1.1 to 2.6 @xmath150 from the small mibeta experiment recently completed [ 17 ] .",
    "cuoricino should reach a comparable sensitivity during its test period . which bound would be actually more restrictive ?",
    "the answer lies in the uncertainties in the nuclear physics .",
