    "although the standard model ( sm ) @xcite is the simplest model that successfully explains most of the phenomena and experimental observations in particle physics , there are still some unexplained observations and theoretical issues that leaves unanswered .",
    "in particular , the astrophysical evidences of electrically neutral , non - baryonic and weakly interacting matter , i.e. dark matter ( dm ) can be naturally understood if the sm is extended .",
    "since the evidences of dm are based only on its gravitational effects , its nature and microscopic properties remains unknown .",
    "thus , in particle physics many extensions of the sm can be proposed with new particles that naturally fits the current astrophysical data and experimental constraints in direct dm detection . among the different candidates for dm , extensions with stable and non - relativistic ( cold ) particles with masses between a few gev and 1 tev , and interacting through the weak nuclear force ( wimps ) are currently the best motivated models which provides a natural scenery for the cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "for example , supersymmetry provides a wimp candidate through the lightest neutralino @xcite . in universal extra dimension models ,",
    "the lightest kaluza - klein partner is stable and a possible dm candidate @xcite .",
    "other models with wimp candidates have been recently proposed , as for example branons in large extra dimensions @xcite , t - odd particles in little higgs models @xcite , and excited states in warped extra dimensions @xcite . also , scalar candidates in scalar extensions of the sm through singlets and doublets have been widely considered @xcite in the literature , and more recently in 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite .",
    "in particular , after the observation of the higgs boson at the lhc @xcite , the existence of scalar elementary particles in the universe have been experimentally established .",
    "thus , extensions of the sm with additional scalar sectors are interesting alternatives that may provide natural scenarios for cdm that match the experimental data .    on the other hand , models with extra @xmath0 symmetry are one of the most studied extensions of the sm , which implies many phenomenological and theoretical advantages including flavor physics @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , dark matter @xcite , among other effects . a complete review of the above possibilities can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "in particular , family nonuniversal @xmath0 symmetry models have many well - established motivations .",
    "for example , they provide hints for solving the sm flavor puzzle , where even though all the fermions acquire masses at the same scale , @xmath8 gev , experimentally they exhibit very different mass values . these models also imply a new @xmath1 neutral boson , which contains a large number of phenomenological consequences at low and high energies @xcite .",
    "in addition to the new neutral gauge boson @xmath1 , an extended fermion spectrum is necessary in order to obtain an anomaly - free theory .",
    "also , the new symmetry requires an extended scalar sector in order to ( i ) generate the breaking of the new abelian symmetry and ( ii ) obtain heavy masses for the new @xmath1 gauge boson and the extra fermion content .",
    "in this paper we consider an nonuniversal @xmath0 extension of the type from reference @xcite , which exhibits an extended scalar sector with two scalar doublets and two singlets with nontrivial @xmath0 charges ( labeled for this particular model as @xmath9 ) , where the lightest scalar singlet ( denoted as @xmath10 ) is taken as candidate for cdm .",
    "some phenomenological consequences of this model have been studied in the above reference , with special emphasis in the neutral gauge and yukawa sectors .",
    "motivated by the problem of dm in astrophysics , further analyses of this model is continued . among the most interesting features that the model exhibits , we mention the following related to dm :    1 .",
    "the additional @xmath1 neutral boson produces low energy deviations through a @xmath11-@xmath1 mixing angle .",
    "restrictions to these deviations from the cern - lep and the slac collider impose restrictions on the mixing angle and the @xmath9 coupling , as we will show . at the same time , since @xmath10 scatter off via the @xmath9 interaction , these parameters have effects on the dm relic density through its annihilation to neutral gauge boson @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the model can impose constraints on astrophysical observables from low energy particle physics .",
    "although data from atomic parity violation additionaly imposes lower constraints on the mass of @xmath1 around @xmath12 tev , the current limit on extra neutral gauge boson on direct research at lhc imposes a stronger limit above @xmath13 tev , which have effects in the couplings of dm with the gauge boson @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   the nonuniversal feature of the quark sector with different @xmath9 charges , could provide new signatures to search for dm presence in hadron colliders .",
    "4 .   by implementing",
    "appropriate conserved discrete or continuos symmetries , we can both remove large flavor changing neutral current couplings and odd power couplings which ensure the stability of the dm candidate . at the same time , these symmetries preserve the couplings that allow the dm annihilation to sm particles required to fit the relic density observed in the universe .",
    "taking into account the most recent calculations of the z pole observables in the sm , the new data from atomic parity violation , and the current limit on the extra neutral gauge boson research at lhc , we find constraints on some parameters associated to the @xmath11-@xmath1 mixing angle and the @xmath9 gauge coupling .",
    "taking into account the above constraints , we obtain allowed regions for the dm relic density according to the last results from planck experiment @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "is devoted to summarizing the spectrum of the model , the interactions with the light scalar singlet , and the basic condition for this scalar to be a cdm candidate .",
    "we also show the weak couplings , taking into account the small @xmath11-@xmath1 mixing angle . in sec . 3 , we perform a global @xmath14 fit at 95% c.l to obtain constraints from the z pole parameters .",
    "in sec . 4 , after summarizing the basic equations for the thermal relic density , we identify the fundamental interactions that determine the thermal average dm annihilation cross section . using the constraints obtained previously from the z pole analysis and using the software micromegas @xcite , we determine the relic density predicted by the model , and constraints on the dm mass for different ranges of the space of parameters according to the observed relic density by assuming that the scalar singlet provides the total composition of dm in the universe .",
    "the particle content of the model @xcite is composed of ordinary sm particles and new exotic non - sm particles , as shown in tables [ tab : sm - espectro ] and [ tab : exotic - espectro ] , respectively , where column @xmath15 indicates the transformation rules under the sm gauge group @xmath16 , column @xmath9 contains the values of the new quantum number @xmath17 , and in the column labeled _ feature _ , we describe the type of field .",
    "some properties of this spectrum are :    1 .",
    "the @xmath9 symmetry is nonuniversal only in the left - handed sm quark sector : the quark family @xmath18 has @xmath19 while families @xmath20 have @xmath21 . to distinguish the top and bottom quarks from the other flavors , we use the following assignation for the phenomenological families : + @xmath22 2 .",
    "the sm leptons and scalar particles obtain nontrivial values for the new charge @xmath17 .",

    "an extra scalar singlet @xmath31 with vev @xmath32 is required to produce the symmetry breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry .",

    "another scalar singlet @xmath10 is introduced .",

    "second , the @xmath11-@xmath1 mixing induces dispersions of the dm candidate @xmath10 through @xmath11 bosons .",
