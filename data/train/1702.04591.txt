    "the @xmath2 state at 7.65 mev in @xmath0c , known as the hoyle state , is one of the most important states in nuclear physics .",
    "this stems from the fact that it is the gateway for the massive @xmath0c production in the universe and is , thus , responsible for life on earth .",
    "it was predicted in 1954 by the the astrophysicist fred hoyle @xcite at practically the correct energy ( found by w. a. fowler _ et al . _ in 1957 @xcite ) .",
    "there was some discussion in the past whether f. hoyle predicted his state on anthropic grounds or not .",
    "apparently , this was not the case , see @xcite .",
    "standard shell model calculations give the energy of the first @xmath3 excited state in @xmath0c at over 20 mev .",
    "therefore , because of its unexpected low energy , the structure of the hoyle state stayed mysterious for a long time . in 1956",
    "morinaga postulated that it is a state where the three @xmath1 particles are lined up straight , the so - called three @xmath1 chain state @xcite .",
    "however , horiuchi in 1974 @xcite found with the semi - microscopic approach called orthogonal condition model ( ocm ) @xcite ( see below ) that the hoyle state should rather be interpreted as a state of three weakly coupled @xmath1-particles interacting pair - wise in relative 0s - wave states .",
    "this point of view was confirmed in 1977 by two ground - breaking works by kamimura _",
    "_ @xcite and uegaki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . using a phenomenological nucleon - nucleon force of gaussian type which was adjusted independently earlier ( volkov force @xcite ) , they reproduced with a fully microscopic twelve nucleon wave function all known properties of the hoyle and other loosely bound @xmath1 states above the hoyle state .",
    "the achievement of the two works was , at their time , so outstanding that- one is tempted to say that as usual after great exploits- the subject of the hoyle state stayed practically dormant for about a quarter century . only in 2001 appeared the work of tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck , and rpke ( thsr ) which interpreted the hoyle state ( and other states in self - conjugate nuclei ) as a condensate of @xmath1-particles @xcite .",
    "that means that the @xmath1 particles with their center of mass motion occupy all the lowest 0s orbit of their common mean field .",
    "this work triggered an intense new interest in the hoyle state , both theoretically and experimentally , see the review articles in @xcite and references in there . at present , this research culminates in works trying to explain the properties of the hoyle state from _ ab initio _ and/or quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches @xcite . already in the work of thsr @xcite ,",
    "it was predicted that in other @xmath4 nuclei hoyle - analog states should exist around the @xmath4 disintegration threshold .",
    "for instance @xmath5o is subject of intense studies , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the situation in these self - conjugate nuclei is now considered under a completely novel aspect , namely that at energies , close to the @xmath1 disintegration threshold , there exist states of extended volume ( 3 - 4 times the volume of the ground state ) where the nuclei are formed by a gas of loosely bound @xmath1 particles which move in their own mean field .",
    "these bosonic states co - exist with the standard fermionic ones , where individual nucleons move in a common mean field .",
    "this is a very exciting new feature of nuclear physics , of importance for nuclei and for astrophysical aspects .",
    "pairing is well known and well accepted as a very useful approximation to describe two particle correlations . pairing between like nucleons ( n - n , p - p ) is a useful concept not only in infinite matter , but also in finite nuclei @xcite . because the interaction between protons and neutrons ( deuteron channel ) is even stronger ( a bound state can be formed )",
    ", one should expect that in symmetric matter also proton - neutron pairing should appear .",
    "calculations performed for the p - n channel give a critical temperature depending on density which can rise up to a value @xmath6 near to 4.5 mev @xcite which is about three times larger than the maximum critical temperature in the isospin triplet channel . however , it competes with the formation of @xmath1 particles , and for these particles the transition to a bose condensate at increasing density occurs prior to the quantum condensation in the deuteron channel as discussed below .",
    "the next step is quartetting which is also a very good approximation in special situations .",
    "the thsr wave function was an important step to be introduced in nuclear structure physics .",
    "nuclear physics is now on the forefront of the studies on quartet and cluster formation , and their possible condensation , but there are also works in other fields with still ongoing interest presently",
    ". for example there exist speculations that in semiconductors where excitons , that is bound states of a conduction electron and an electron hole , can bind to bi - excitons which may enter in competition with single excitons in a possible bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "there exist also theoretical works which predict that , once four different fermions can be trapped in cold atom devices , bound quartets can be formed with again the possibility of bec @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review briefly the present situation concerning the possibility of @xmath1 particle condensation and other @xmath1 gas states in selfconjugate nuclei which was proposed for the first time 15 years back in @xcite .",
    "it may be important to clarify already at this point that we understand the word `` condensate '' or `` condensation '' in the sense that the @xmath1 particles with inert internal structure move all with their center of mass ( c.o.m . ) in the same lowest 0s orbit of their common mean field .",
    "we will show in the main part of this article that these states can be considered as the precursors of a macroscopic @xmath1 particle condensate in homogeneous nuclear matter at low density .",
    "of course , the reader should understand that in the following the term condensate for a handful of @xmath1 particles is stretched to its limits .",
    "+ because of its outstanding importance , we will mainly concentrate on @xmath0c and the hoyle state but , at the end of this colloquium , we also will touch the situation in other nuclei .",
    "we shall present in condensed form the various theoretical attempts which are used to describe the formation and existence of quartets in nuclei , that is the @xmath1 gas states , induced by strong four nucleon correlations ( 2 neutrons-2 protons ) at densities well below saturation .",
    "we will discuss to which degree they give arguments against or in favor of the hypothesis that the hoyle state can be considered to good approximation as a state where the three @xmath1 s are condensed into the c.o.m .",
    "0s - orbital .",
    "+ historically , the idea of @xmath1 condensation is based on the study in ref .",
    "@xcite where the critical temperature of quartet condensation in infinite matter was investigated .",
    "this study was performed in analogy to the determination of the critical temperature for the onset of pairing , i.e. , superfluidity or superconductivity , employing the in - medium two fermion equation as done by thouless @xcite ( now known as the thouless criterion ) . for the @xmath1 particle , the",
    "corresponding in - medium four fermion equation has been used and solved in @xcite . since the @xmath1 particle is a very strongly bound quartet with a binding energy / particle of @xmath7 7.5 mev which is about seven times larger than the one of the deuteron and almost as large as in the strongest bound nucleus which is iron , the critical temperature turned out to be , at low density , over a factor of six higher than the one of neutron - neutron pairing .",
    "this finding was then logically transposed , in analogy what had happened in the case of pairing , to finite nuclei .",
    "the presentation of the physics involved in quartetting is the main subject of this colloquium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii , we give a short summary of the thsr approach with the main focus on what it predicts with respect to the hoyle state being an @xmath1-particle condensate state . in sect .",
    "iii , we revisit in a nutshell all other theories which may have some connection with the @xmath1 condensate aspect . in sect .",
    "iv we give a glimpse on the situation in @xmath5o and in sect .",
    "v , eventual experimental evidences are discussed .",
    "finally in the last section , we present some further discussions together with our conclusions and a short outlook .",
    "as already mentioned , in 2001 a new aspect of the hoyle state came at the forefront of the discussion .",
    "in @xcite it was advanced that the hoyle state might not only be a gas - like state of three @xmath1-particles but it was suggested that the three @xmath1 s are , with their center of mass ( c.o.m . ) motion condensed into an identical 0s - orbital , a situation reminiscent of what happens in cold atom physics where , however , exists a much larger number of bosons .",
    "in addition it was predicted that not only @xmath0c contains such an @xmath1 condensate but also several heavier self - conjugate nuclei like @xmath5o , @xmath8ne , etc .",
    "may exhibit analogous features .",
    "the idea of condensation was first investigated in nuclear matter @xcite and then borne out by the use of a condensate type of wave function for finite self - conjugate nuclei , now known according to their authors as the thsr wave function @xcite .",
    "the most basic form of thsr is , e.g. , for the case of three @xmath1 particles a _ single _ wave function of following structure    @xmath9    with    @xmath10    and    @xmath11    in ( [ thsrwf ] ) the @xmath12 are the c.o.m .",
    "coordinates of @xmath1 particle @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the total c.o.m .",
    "coordinate of @xmath0c .",
    "@xmath15 is the antisymmetrizer of the twelve nucleon wave function with @xmath16 the intrinsic translational invariant wave function of the @xmath1-particle @xmath13. the whole 12 nucleon wave function in ( [ thsrwf ] ) is , therefore , translationally invariant .",
    "please note that we suppressed the scalar spin - isospin part of the wave function . the special gaussian form given in eqs .",
    "( [ a - wf ] ) , ( [ int - a - wf ] ) was chosen in @xcite to ease the variational calculation .",
    "the condensate aspect lies in the fact that ( [ thsrwf ] ) is a ( antisymmetrized ) product of three times the same @xmath1-particle wave function and is , thus , analogous to a number projected bcs wave function in the case of pairing .",
    "this twelve nucleon wave function has two variational parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it possesses the remarkable property that for @xmath19 it is a pure harmonic oscillator slater determinant ( this aspect of ( [ thsrwf ] ) is explained in @xcite ) whereas for @xmath20 the @xmath1 s are at low density so far apart from one another that the antisymmetrizer can be dropped and , thus , ( [ thsrwf ] ) becomes a simple product of three @xmath1 particles , all in identical 0s states , that is , a pure condensate state .",
    "the minimization of the energy with a hamiltonian containing a nucleon - nucleon force determined earlier independently @xcite allows to obtain a reasonable value for the ground state energy of @xmath21c .",
    "variation of energy under the condition that ( [ thsrwf ] ) is orthogonal to the previously determined ground state allows to calculate the first excited @xmath3 state , i.e. , the hoyle state .",
    "while the size of the individual @xmath1 particles remains very close to their free space value ( @xmath22 1.37 fm ) , the variationally determined @xmath18 parameter takes on about three times this value .",
    "it is important to mention right away that this so determined thsr wave function has about 98 percent squared overlap with the one of kamimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( and practically 100 percent squared overlap with a slightly more general thsr wave function superposing several @xmath18 values ) .",
    "we will shortly explain kamimura s wave function below in sect .",
    "it can , even to day , after 40 years , be considered as one of the most efficient approaches for the hoyle state . in any case , as in the work of kamimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , so does the thsr approach reproduce very well all known experimental data about the hoyle state .",
    "this concerns for instance the inelastic form factor , electromagnetic transition probability , and position of energy , see for more details @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the inelastic form factor is shown in fig.[qmc ] below . at practically the same time uegaki _ et al .",
    "_ published a very similar paper leading to almost identical results @xcite . in the following , we often will only refer to kamimura s work , since we were able to compare thsr and kamimura s wave functions numerically .",
    "however , all what we say below about kamimura s work should equally apply to the one of uegaki .",
    "the thsr wave function contains two limits : a pure slater determinant and a pure bose condensate below about a 5-th of the saturation density @xmath23 .",
    "to which end , the hoyle state is closest ?    .",
    "the value at the optimal @xmath18 values , @xmath24 for the ground state and @xmath25 for the hoyle state , are denoted by a circle and a cross , respectively . ]    to this end it is very instructive to consider the effect of the antisymmetriser in ( [ thsrwf ] ) in more detail . in fig.[fig : anti ] we show the expectation value of the antisymmetrizer    @xmath26    in the hoyle state .",
    "indicated are the optimal values of the @xmath18 parameter for the ground state and the hoyle state .    for @xmath27",
    "the quantity in ( [ anti - sym ] ) tends to one , since , as already mentioned , the @xmath1 particles are in this case so far apart from one another that antisymmetrisation becomes negligeable .",
    "the result for @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : anti ] as a function of the width parameter @xmath18 .",
    "we chose as optimal values of @xmath18 for describing the ground and hoyle states , @xmath29 fm and @xmath30= 6.8 fm , for which the normalised thsr wave functions give the best approximation of the ground state @xmath31 and the hoyle state @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these results indicate that the influence of the antisymmetrisation is strongly reduced in the hoyle state compared with the ground state .",
    "this study gives us a first indication that the hoyle state is quite close to the quartet condensation situation rather than being close to a slater determinant .",
    "however , there is another quantity which tells us more directly whether the hoyle state is close to a three @xmath1 condensate or not . in @xcite suzuki",
    "_ evaluated the bosonic occupation numbers using a gaussian representation of the c.o.m .",
    "part @xmath35 of the rgm ( resonating group method ) wave function , see sect .",
    "iii.b , to calculate the single @xmath1 particle density matrix @xmath36 and diagonalising it .",
    "the bosonic occupation numbers were also calculated by yamada et al . in @xcite using , however , the already mention ocm approach , see below .",
    "both calculations concluded that the three @xmath1 s in the hoyle state occupy to about 70 percent the same 0s orbit whereas all other ones are down by at least a factor of ten , see fig .",
    "[ occs-12c ] .",
    "the density - induced suppression of the @xmath1 particle condensate has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "particle occupation numbers in the ground state ( left ) and in the hoyle state ( right ) @xcite , height=226 ]    .",
    "[ occs-12c ]    the thsr calculation also showed that the inelastic form factor from the ground to hoyle state is very sensitive to the size of the hoyle state  @xcite .",
    "for example extending artificially the size of the hoyle state by 20@xmath37 , increases the inelastic form factor globally by a factor of two . the thsr approach yields for the rms radius 3.83 fm ( ground state 2.4 fm ) , so that the volume ( density ) of the hoyle state is approximately 3 - 4 times larger ( lower ) than the one of the ground state .",
    "those numbers are rather similar to what one finds for @xmath38be reinforcing the picture of the hoyle state of a low density three @xmath1 system where the @xmath1 particles are individually well borne out , see fig .",
    "[ densities8be ] below .",
    "since the thsr wave function has 98 - 100 @xmath37 squared overlap ( depending on more or less elaborate versions of thsr ) with the wave function for the hoyle state of kamimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which , together with @xcite can be considered as the most general ansatz used so far with practically perfect precision even far out in the tail , one can deduce that implicitly the kamimura approach also gives a @xmath7 70@xmath37 bosonic occupancy for the @xmath1 particles in the hoyle state . as a remark on the side",
    ", one may notice that for single proton or neutron states in nuclei one also obtains occupancies of 70 - 80@xmath37  @xcite .",
    "one may , therefore , say that the bosonic quartets in nuclei excited to energies around the @xmath1 decay threshold are about as far from ( or as close to ) the ideal gas case as are the fermions in the ground state . on the other hand , in cold atom devices , the bosonic atoms are at so low densities that their electronic clouds do not overlap at all and , thus , ideal bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) can develop  @xcite .",
    "+ at this point , let us stress again that terms like @xmath1 particle condensation or bose - einstein condensation strictu sensu apply only for macroscopic systems as homogeneous nuclear matter which we will treat later . in finite nuclei such terms can only be used in the sense that condensate states are to be considered as precursers to what happens potentially in the infinite matter case .",
    "the precursor of all more or less realistic tentatives to explain the hoyle state is the semi - microscopic description by horiuchi _ et al . _ in 1975 @xcite using the ocm approach as mentioned in the introduction . in the latter ,",
    "the @xmath1 particles are replaced by ideal bosons interacting with phenomenological two and three body forces . however , in an important aspect the pauli principle is incorporated into the ocm approach . it is related to the fact that the physical states should be orthogonal to the so - called pauli forbidden states .",
    "so , in ocm the 2 , 3 , ... body bosonic equations are solved under the condition @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the pauli forbidden states .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath38be those are given by harmonic oscillator 0s , 1s , and 0d wave functions ( up to four @xmath41 quanta ) because four neutrons plus four protons in a harmonic oscillator also occupy four @xmath41 quanta .",
    "in @xcite , it is stated for the first time that the hoyle state is not a linear chain state but rather a state of _",
    "s weakly coupled to each other in relative s - states_. it also was concluded that the hoyle state has quite enlarged spacial structure compared to the one of the ground state of @xmath0c .",
    "the authors did not investigate the bose condensate character of the hoyle state but it is clear that from a state of _",
    "loosely bound @xmath1 particles _ to a condensate of @xmath1 s , there is only a short step .    as we will see later in sect",
    "iv , concerning a study of the @xmath3 spectrum in @xmath5o , ocm remains a very efficient method for @xmath1 cluster states .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ gs - wf12c ] the radial part of the hoyle wave function calculated with ocm @xcite ( full line ) .",
    "we see no nodal behavior of the hoyle orbit , only small oscillations in the inner region and a long tail up to @xmath42 10 fm .",
    "the radial behavior of the hoyle orbit is similar to a gaussian ( dotted line ) . on the contrary , in the ground state of @xmath0c where the @xmath1 s strongly overlap , due to the active pauli principle",
    ", strong oscillations develop with number of nodes two , one , and zero for s , d , and g waves , respectively .",
    "this reflects very well the su(3 ) character of the @xmath0c ground state .",
    "the ground state wave function ( upper panel ) is compared to the one of the hoyle state ( lower panel ) .",
    "we see the strong difference in spacial extensions .",

    "( [ kamimura ] ) , ( [ uegaki ] ) the scalar spin - isospin part of the wave function is not written out ) . in ( [ uegaki ] )",
    "@xmath47 is the generator coordinate weight function and @xmath48 is a projector onto zero total momentum .",
    "the brink wave function @xmath49 @xcite places the small sized @xmath1 particles with width parameter @xmath17 at definite spatial points @xmath50 .",
    "these three body wave functions have been determined variationally with rgm ( gcm ) by kamimura et al.@xcite ( uegaki et al.@xcite ) .",
    "notice that the angle of the third @xmath1 with respect to the axis of the other two is completely free , as well as the distance with respect to the other two @xmath1 particles .",
    "therefore , all kinds of 3@xmath1 arrangements from linear chain over open triangle to equilateral triangle , etc .",
    "are in principle possible . on the other hand ,",
    "since the thsr wave function is equivalent to kamimura s wave function , this tells us that implicitly kamimura s wave function also contains to about 70 @xmath37 an @xmath1 particle condensate component .",
    "we will later show in fig.[qmc ] that the inelastic form factor of kamimura and thsr are on top of one another explaining very accurately the experimental data .",
    "in addition to all known properties of the hoyle state , kamimura et al . and uegaki et al .",
    "explained a variety of other @xmath1 gas states in @xmath0c with different quantum numbers such as , e.g. , the second 2@xmath51 state whose position was experimentally only confirmed very recently @xcite .",
    "as horiuchi , also kamimura and uegaki concluded that the hoyle state is a _",
    "weakly coupled system or gas of alpha particles _ in relative s - waves .",
    "we cite uegaki _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite : _  in a number of excited states which belong to the new `` phase '' , @xmath0c nucleus should be considered to dissociate into 3 @xmath1-clusters which interact weakly with each other and move almost freely over a wide region. _ and further : _",
    "the @xmath2 state is the lowest state which belongs to the new `` phase '' , and could be considered to be a finite system of @xmath1-boson gas. _ these words are very similar to what we use nowadays in the context of the thsr approach . for instance , the container picture @xcite of which we again will talk later in sect.iii.e , is already alluded to . the major difference between thsr and those earlier works consists in that thsr predicted that @xmath1 particle condensation may not only exist in @xmath0c but also in heavier @xmath4 nuclei , as , for instance in @xmath5o @xcite and , thus , may be a more general phenomenon .",
    "also the bosonic occupation numbers were not calculated at that time .      in 2007",
    "the hoyle state was also newly calculated by the practioneers of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) ( kanada enyo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and fermion molecular dynamics ( fmd ) ( chernykh _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) approaches . in amd one",
    "uses a slater determinant of single - particle gaussian wave packets where the center of the packets @xmath50 are replaced by complex numbers .",
    "this allows to give the center of the gaussians a velocity as one easily realizes . in fmd in addition",
    "the width parameters of the gaussians are also complex numbers and , in principle , different for each nucleon .",
    "amd and fmd do not contain any preconceived information of clustering .",
    "both approaches found from a variational determination of the parameters of the wave function and a prior projection on good total linear and angular momenta that the hoyle state has dominantly a 3-@xmath1 cluster structure with no definite geometrical configurations . in this way the @xmath1 cluster anstze of the earlier approaches were justified . as an achievment , in @xcite , the inelastic form factor from the ground to hoyle state",
    "was successfully reproduced in employing an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction v@xmath52 derived from the realistic bare argonne v18 potential ( plus a small phenomenological correction ) .",
    "kanada enyo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite pointed out that with amd some breaking of the @xmath1 clusters can and is taken into account .",
    "the volkov force @xcite was employed in @xcite .",
    "again all properties of the hoyle state were explained with these approaches . like in the other works @xcite , the e0 transition probability came out",
    "@xmath7 20 @xmath37 too high .",
    "no bosonic occupation numbers were calculated .",
    "it seems technically difficult to do this with these types of wave functions .",
    "however , one can suspect that if occupation numbers were calculated , the results would not be very different from the thsr results .",
    "this stems from the high sensitivity of the inelastic form factor to the employed wave function .",
    "nontheless , it would be important to produce the occupation numbers also with amd and fmd .    in @xcite",
    "some geometrical configurations of @xmath1 particles in the hoyle state are shown .",
    "no special configuration out of several is dominant .",
    "this reflects the fact that the hoyle state is not in a crystal - like @xmath1 configuration but rather forms to a large extent a bose condensate .      in some works the hoyle state",
    "is approached in treating the @xmath1 particles completely as ideal bosons .",
    "even the fact that the physical states should be orthogonal to the pauli forbidden states , as is done in ocm , is not taken care of . the effect of antisymmetrisation is entirely simulated by effective forces .",
    "the two most recent approaches of this sort are the ones of lazauskas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( who used the non - local papp - moszkowski force @xcite ) and , more recently , of ishikawa @xcite using a modified ali - bodmer interaction  @xcite plus a three body term . in @xcite the position of the hoyle state and the @xmath1 threshold energies are well reproduced . in @xcite also the relative angular momenta between the @xmath1 particles in the hoyle states are analysed .",
    "it turns out that there is s - wave dominance to about 80 @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that also the s - wave occupation number is of the order of 70 - 80 @xmath37 .",
    "this is shown in @xcite where such an analysis was also performed .",
    "it was found that the proportion of partial waves is practically the same as in @xcite .",
    "in addition the bosonic occupation numbers were calculated and the 0s occupancy turned out to be @xmath7 80 @xmath37 , thus confirming the bose - condensate picture @xcite .",
    "the strong link between relative s - wave dominance and high s - wave occupation numbers is likely a general feature . on the other hand in @xcite",
    "the simultaneous and democratic three @xmath1 decay probability was given .",
    "this can be considered as a great achievement .",
    "the probability with respect to sequential @xmath38be + @xmath1 decay resulted to be negligeable ( branching ratio : 10@xmath53 ) .",
    "however , this does not speak against @xmath1 particle condensation .",
    "it simply means that three body decay ( tunnelling under the coulomb barrier ) is strongly hindered .",
    "a nice way to compare brink and thsr wave functions is the following hybrid ansatz , e.g. , for @xmath38be    @xmath54    in this way the thsr and brink wave functions are encapsulated in one formula .",
    "for @xmath19 , we have the brink wave function @xmath49 ( [ uegaki ] ) and for @xmath55 , we have the thsr wave function ( [ thsrwf ] ) .",
    "it turned out in a number of examples where the two variational parameters @xmath18 and @xmath56 have been put into competition that always @xmath57 and @xmath58 was the outcome of a variational calculation , see , e.g. , @xcite and unpublished work . therefore , the thsr picture where the large @xmath18 parameter indicates free mean field motion of the cluster , the so - called container picture @xcite prevails over the brink ansatz where the clusters are nailed down to definite positions via the @xmath50 parameters .",
    "this latter evokes the dumbbell or molecular picture which was used almost exclusively in the past , for example in the description of @xmath38be .",
    "it is true that most of the time , not a single brink wave function was considered but a superposition smearing out the position of the clusters .",
    "this was believed to be a correction and the underlying picture was thought to remain the dumbbell or molecular one . however , as the studies with the hybrid wave function ( [ hybrid ] ) show , the basic property of cluster motion is just the contrary : free motion in a cluster mean field , the container. of course , the clusters in their motion can not penetrate each other , due to the pauli principle .",
    "the @xmath1 clusters can be considered as ideal bosons moving in their own bosonic mean field freely over the whole nuclear volume except for mutual overlaps .",
    "this can also nicely be seen in fig .",
    "[ densities8be ] of @xcite where the two @xmath1 correlation in @xmath0c(@xmath59 as function of their mutual distance is displayed .",
    "it practically corresponds to the excluded volume idea often employed phenomenologically in cluster physics .",
    "this repulsive force between two @xmath1 s also is the reason why they can not be 100 @xmath37 in a condensate state but to a certain percentage the @xmath1 s are scattered out of the condensate . a nice comparison between the brink and thsr approach is shown in fig .  [ densities8be ] where we compare the intrinsic density distribution of @xmath38be calculated with the single thsr wave function ( lower panel ) with the one of a single brink wave function ( upper panel ) .",
    "the strong difference in localization of both distributions should be appreciated . here",
    "the intrinsic density means that the system is in a symmetry broken deformed state which is close to a classical picture . of course ,",
    "the ground state ( remember that @xmath38be is slightly unstable with a width of only some ev whereas nuclear energy scales are mev ) of @xmath38be has quantum number @xmath3 and in the laboratory frame this state is spherical .",
    "this is obtained from the deformed intrinsic state in averaging it over the whole angular range in space .    in more recent works , similar results to the ones with a single brink wave function",
    "have been obtained with a more general mean field approach of the gogny or relativistic mean field ( rmf ) type @xcite . as an example",
    "it was found that expanding a nucleus like @xmath5o employing a constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach , at some critical low density , the nucleons spontaneously cluster into a tetrahedron of four @xmath1 particles .",
    "these @xmath1 particles have fixed positions like they can be formed with a single brink wave function @xmath49 in ( [ uegaki ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ densities8be ] upper panel .",
    "the general mean field approach has , however , the advantage that realistic density functionals can be used . whether a gcm calculation can be applied on top of these configurations like with a brink - gcm wave function , remains to be seen .",
    "another approach of @xmath1 clustering in @xmath0c has been put forward recently . in @xcite an algebraic model put forward by iachello _",
    "@xcite , originally due to teller @xcite , was used on the hypothesis that the ground state of @xmath0c has an equilateral triangle structure .",
    "the model then allows to calculate the rotational - vibrational ( rot - vib ) spectrum of three @xmath1 particles .",
    "notably a newly measured 5@xmath60 state very nicely fits into the rotational band of a spinning triangle .",
    "this interpretation is also reinforced by the fact that for such a situation the 4@xmath51 and 4@xmath60 states should be degenerate what is effectively the case experimentally . in fig.[yoshiko ] , we show the triangular density distribution of the @xmath0c ground state obtained from a pure mean field calculation .",
    "this means a calculation without any projection on parity nor angular momentum .",
    "therefore , symmetry is spontaneously broken into a triangular shape .",
    "the calculation is obtained under the same conditions as in @xcite . however , in that work only figures with variation after projection are shown @xcite .",
    "this enhances the triangular shape .",
    "the fig.[yoshiko ] is unpublished .",
    "it must be said , however , that the broken symmetry to a triangular shape is very subtle and depends on the force used @xcite .",
    "anyway , such a triangular shape seems definitely a possibility .",

    "@xcite that the states @xmath75 do not form a rotational band .",
    "the line which connects the two other hypothetical members of the rotational band , see fig  [ hoyle - rot ] , has a slope which points to somewhere in between of the 0@xmath74 and 0@xmath69 states . to conclude from there that this gives raise to a rotational band ,",
    "may be premature .",
    "one should also realise that the @xmath76 state is strongly excited from the hoyle state by monopole transition whose strength is obtained from the extended thsr calculation to be @xmath77 = 35 fm@xmath71 .",

    "one sees that except for the @xmath84 state , all the states have the largest contribution from the @xmath85 $ ] channel .",
    "so , the picture which arises is as follows : in the hoyle state , the three @xmath1 s are all in relative 0s states with some @xmath1-pair correlations ( even with @xmath86 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , responsible for emptying the @xmath1 condensate by 20 - 30@xmath37 .",
    "this s - wave dominance , so far found by about half a dozen different theoretical works , see , e.g. , @xcite , is incompatible with the picture of a rotating triangle .",

    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 states are a mixture of various relative angular momentum states ( fig .",
    "[ probas-0,2,4-hoyle ] ) . whether they can be qualified as members of a rotational band or ,",

    "let us also mention that the excited @xmath1 cluster states discussed above have a width much larger ( @xmath7 1 mev ) than the hoyle state ( @xmath7 1 ev ) .",
    "nevertheless , they are treated in bound state approximation .",
    "one may also wonder why , with the extended thsr approach , there is a relatively strong difference between the calculated and experimental , so - called hoyle band ?",
    "this may have to do with a deficiency inherent to the thsr wave function which so far has not been cured ( there may be ways to do it in the future ) .",
    "it concerns the fact that with thsr ( as , by the way , with the brink wave function ) , it is difficult to include the spin - orbit potential .",
    "this has as a consequence that the first @xmath64 and first @xmath65 states are quite wrong in energy because the strong energy splitting between @xmath91 and @xmath92 states is missing .",
    "this probably has a repercussion on the position of the second @xmath64 and @xmath65 states .",

    "_  @xcite also shown in fig.[hoyle - rot ] where the @xmath64 and @xmath65 states of the ground state rotational band have been adjusted to experiment with a phenomenological force and , thus , the position of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 states of the so - called hoyle - band is much improved .",
    "aditionally , this may also come from the fact that with this extended thsr wave function a different force has to be adopted .",
    "such investigations are under way .      very recently a break through in the description of the hoyle state was achieved by two groups @xcite using monte carlo techniques . in @xcite dean lee _",
    "_ reproduced the low lying spectrum of @xmath0c , including the hoyle state , very accuratly with a so - called ab initio lattice qmc approach starting from effective chiral field theory .",
    "the sign problem has been circumvented exploiting the fact that su(4 ) symmetry is very well fullfilled , at least for the lighter nuclei .",
    "this parameter free first principle calculation is an important step forward in the explanation of the structure of @xmath0c . on the other hand ,",
    "all quantities which are more sensitive to details of the wave function have so far either not been calculated ( e.g. , inelastic form factor to the hoyle state ) or the results are in quite poor agreement with the results of practically all other theoretical approaches .",
    "this , for instance , is the case for the rms radius of the hoyle state which in @xcite is barely larger than the one of the ground state whereas it is usually believed that the hoyle state is quite extended .",
    "the authors of @xcite remark themselves that higher order contributions to the chiral expansion have to be included to account for the size of the hoyle state .",
    "on the other hand , there exist new green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) results with constrained path approximation using the argonne v18 two - body and illinois-7 three - body forces , where the inelastic form factor for most of the experimental points is reproduced very accurately @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ qmc ] , we compare this result with the one obtained from thsr .",
    "the results of kamimura @xcite are on top of the thsr ones .",
    "they can not be distinguished from the thsr ones on the scale of the graph demonstrating again the equivalence of both approaches .",
    "we see excellent agreement between the three calculations and with experiment . in the insert of the upper panel , we see nevertheless that the rather precise experimental transition radius of 5.29@xmath93 0.14 fm@xmath71 given in @xcite is much better reproduced than in @xmath1 cluster models which all yield an about 20% too large value . this may also be the reason for the too slow drop off of the thsr density in the surface region , see lower panel of fig.[hoyle - density ] below .",
    "the energy of the hoyle state is with around 10 mev in @xcite slightly worse than the one in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ hoyle - density ] , we compare the density of the hoyle state ( weighted with @xmath94 ) obtained with the thsr wave function and in @xcite .",
    "we again see quite good agreement between both figures up to about 4 fm .",
    "for instance the kind of plateau between 1.5 and 4 fm seems to be very characteristic .",
    "it is , however , more pronounced in the gfmc calculation than from thsr . for a better appreciation ,",
    "we repeat the results of thsr separately in the lower panel of fig.[hoyle - density ] . beyond 4 fm",
    ", the density in @xcite falls off more rapidly .",
    "as already mentioned , this may be due to the fact that the gfmc results are more accurate for small @xmath95-values . at any rate ,",
    "the outcome of the three calculations in @xcite is so close that it is difficult to believe that results for other quantities should be qualitatively different when calculated with the gfmc technique .",

    "inelastic form factors from gfmc  @xcite , upper panel , and thsr @xcite , lower panel .",
    "the thsr result can not be distinguished from the one of @xcite on the scale of the figure.,width=264 ]          last but certainly not least , we want to consider @xmath1 clustering and @xmath1 condensation in nuclear matter . as a matter of fact , it was for nuclear matter where the possibility of @xmath1 particle condensation had been considered first , see @xcite where the critical temperature from an in medium four nucleon ( two protons and two neutrons ) equation has been established . in @xcite an improved calculation is presented , see fig .  [ tcrit ] .",
    "this is in complete analogy to what is known as the thouless criterion for the onset of pairing as a function of temperature .",
    "it was found , that despite of its strong binding , the @xmath1 condensate , as a function of increasing density , breaks rapidly down as soon as the chemical potential passes substantially from negative values ( binding ) to positive ones .",
    "this is contrary to what happens for pairing where the strong coupling limit passes continuously to the weak , bcs - type of limit with positive values of the chemical potential and a long coherence length ( size ) of the cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "the density where @xmath1 condensation as a function of temperature breaks down is about a fifth of the saturation density .",
    "the reason for this very different behavior between pairing and quartetting has to do with the fact that the in medium two particle level density @xmath96 , for the two particles at rest , has a finite value at the fermi level whereas this is not the case with the four body level density @xmath97 which goes through zero at the fermi energy , just at the point where quartet correlations should build up . here",
    "@xmath98 are kinetic energies and @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 the chemical potential .",
    "we leave it to the reader to verify this but it is also explained in @xcite . as a matter of fact all many body level densities of this kind go through zero at the fermi level , besides , precisely in the one body and two body cases when the two particles are at rest .",
    "another well known example of this kind is the two particle - one hole level density which enters the perturbative calculation of the mean free path of a fermion in a fermionic medium . at the fermi energy",
    "the mean free path becomes infinite because the 2p-1h level density goes through zero there .",
    "+ in conclusion , it is legitimate to see in the hoyle state ( and other similar states in heavier self - conjugate nuclei ) the precursor of the infinite matter situation , see also @xcite where @xmath1 matter was investigated with a crystal structure .",
    "the situation is then quite analogous to pairing in nuclei which can be considered as a precursor of pairing in neutron matter , i.e. , neutron stars .",
    "the situation in @xmath5o is again quite a bit more complicated than in @xmath0c .",
    "the fact is that between the 4@xmath1 threshold and the ground state , there are a couple of @xmath3 states which can be interpreted as @xmath102c cluster configurations . in fig .",

    "only the highest state was identified with the 4@xmath1 condensate state .",
    "the four other excited @xmath3 states are @xmath103c configurations . for example",
    "the 5-th @xmath3 state is interpreted as an @xmath1 orbiting in a higher nodal s - wave around the ground state of @xmath0c .",
    "the 4-th @xmath3 state contains an @xmath1 orbiting in a p - wave around the first @xmath104 state in @xmath0c . in the 3-rd @xmath3 state",

    "the single parameter thsr calculation can only reproduce correctly the ground state and the @xmath1 condensate state ( @xmath106 ) . by construction",
    "it can not describe @xmath107 @xmath0c configurations .",
    "so , the two intermediate states give some sort of average picture of the four @xmath1 plus @xmath0c configurations .",
    "one would have to employ a more general ansatz like in ( [ e - thsr ] ) to cope with the situation .",
    "work in this direction is in progress . the @xmath106 state is theoretically identified as the @xmath1-condensate state from the overlap squared @xmath108 @xcite . in fig .  [ spec - factor-16o ]",
    "we see that the @xmath106 state has an overwhelming contribution from the hoyle state plus @xmath1 particle",

    "all those works concluded that the three @xmath1 s of the hoyle state occupy to @xmath7 70 - 80 @xmath37 a 0s state with their c.o.m .",
    "however , about half a dozen of other works exist which predict a 80 @xmath37 relative s - wave dominance between the @xmath1 s in the hoyle state , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "since ishikawa found @xmath131 relative s - wave dominance in his 3 boson ( @xmath1 ) calculation and also calculated the mean field boson ( @xmath1 ) occupation numbers with also @xmath132 s - wave , one logically can conclude a strong correlation between dominance of relative s - wave and dominance of s - wave bosonic occupation number . according to this finding",
    ", one can say that the hoyle state is to a large extent an @xmath1 particle condensate of low density ( @xmath133 of saturation ) . quite naturally ,",
    "this can be considered as a precursor to @xmath1 particle condensation in low density nuclear matter , see section iii.h .",
    "this should be seen in analogy to the pairing case where only a handful of cooper pairs are present and nuclear superfluidity can be considered as the precursor of superfluidity in neutron matter , i.e. , neutron stars .",
    "the thsr wave function is a single variational wave function which fully respects the pauli principle among all nucleons and which allows to interpolate between a pure slater determinant and a pure bose condensate according to a single variational parameter @xmath18 .",
    "we also have considered a hybrid thsr wave function where in the single brink wave function a variable width parameter @xmath18 has been introduced . for the positions of the @xmath1 s",
    "all going to zero , one recovers the thsr wave function and for finite positions but @xmath134 , with @xmath17 the free space width of the @xmath1 , one recovers the brink wave function reflecting a crystal structure of the @xmath1 arrangement .",
    "the two variational parameters @xmath18 and positions have been put into competition with a variational calculation for the energy .",
    "the variation largely yields an answer close to the bose condensate picture , i.e. , a large @xmath18 value , covering the whole nuclear volume , and with positions of the @xmath1 s all centered at the origin .",
    "such competition has also been analyzed schematically by zinner and jensen  @xcite who also concluded that a large extension of the @xmath1 wave functions covering the whole nuclear volume is akin to bose condensation .",
    "the parameter free reproduction of all experimentally known properties of the hoyle state with thsr , gives a further strong argument for the condensate picture .",
    "since the thsr wave function has a @xmath7 98 percent squared overlap with kamimura s hoyle state , the former is not just an approximation to the latter but is equivalent .",
    "one can , thus , argue that implicitly the work of kamimura ( and uegaki ) also describes the hoyle state as a bose condensate of @xmath1 particles , a new insight to the otherwise very successful approaches of those authors about 40 years ago .",
    "we also pointed out that their work can still to day be considered as the most advanced approach to the @xmath1 cluster structure of @xmath0c .",
    "their wave function does not contain any preconceived ingredients for @xmath1 particle condensation because , in principle , with rgm or brink - gcm the @xmath1 s can take any arrangement they like .",
    "we surmise that all approaches which so far reproduced the measured properties of the hoyle state , for instance the inelastic form factor , implicitly describe the same @xmath1 particle condensate as does the thsr approach .",
    "this should notably be the case for amd and fmd theories and , in particular , also with the very recent gfmc approach .",
    "it is nevertheless very desirable that the bosonic occupation numbers will be calculated with those approaches as well .",
    "comparison of single @xmath1 particle wave functions in the condensate states of @xmath0c and @xmath5o .",
    "one should remark the similarity of both wave functions ( up to a scale factor ) .",
    "the dotted line in the upper panel is a best fit of a gaussian to the calculated curve ( full line ) . in the lower panel ,",
    "the dotted line represents the single @xmath1 partical wave function in the ground state .",
    "the strong distortion of an @xmath1 particle in the compact ground state should be remarked .",
    "the upper panel shows the same quantity as in fig.[gs - wf12c ] but from a different calculation @xcite .",
    "we show it here again for a direct comparison with the @xmath5o case.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   comparison of single @xmath1 particle wave functions in the condensate states of @xmath0c and @xmath5o .",
    "one should remark the similarity of both wave functions ( up to a scale factor ) .",
    "the dotted line in the upper panel is a best fit of a gaussian to the calculated curve ( full line ) . in the lower panel",
    ", the dotted line represents the single @xmath1 partical wave function in the ground state .",
    "the strong distortion of an @xmath1 particle in the compact ground state should be remarked .",
    "the upper panel shows the same quantity as in fig.[gs - wf12c ] but from a different calculation @xcite .",
    "we show it here again for a direct comparison with the @xmath5o case.,title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]    further indications of the validity of the condensation picture , also discussed in  @xcite are the fact that the de - broglie wave length of the @xmath1 particles in the hoyle state is by factors larger than the extension of the hoyle state , that is , larger than the inter @xmath1 distance , ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , the calculated shape of the @xmath1 particle wave function in the condensate practically does not change , besides a trivial norm factor , from @xmath0c to @xmath5o , see refs .",
    "@xcite , this being another criterium of @xmath1 condensation , see fig.[alpha - wavefcts ] .    in this work",
    ", we only shortly discussed the situation in @xmath5o where the @xmath106 state at 15.1 mev is identified as an @xmath1 condensate state  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1 disintegration threshold rises rather sharply with the number of @xmath1 particles , one may wonder whether states at such high energies do not acquire a very large width , i.e. , decay in very short times .",
    "the 15.1 mev state in @xmath5o has a width of only 160 kev what is very small considering that excitation energy .",
    "this stems from the fact that all the states underneath have a strongly different structure .",
    "nevertheless , the ground states have a certain percentage of @xmath1 gas components and vice versa the condensate states have some shell model components .",
    "this gives raise to the decay probability which , of course , increases with more @xmath1 particles but shall stay unusually small .",
    "very promising approaches to the hoyle state are two recent attempts using qmc techniques . epelbaum",
    "@xcite used so - called lattice qmc based on chiral perturbation theory with eft ( energy functional theory ) .",
    "the only open input parameters are the current quark masses .",
    "the low lying spectrum of @xmath0c is very well reproduced .",
    "however , no inelastic form factor is calculated as yet .",
    "@xcite make use of gfmc with the fixed node approximation .",
    "the inelastic form factor of the hoyle state is very well reproduced , see fig .",
    "[ qmc ] where we also show the inelastic form factor obtained with both the thsr approach and the one of @xcite .",
    "all three theories reproduce the inelastic form factor very well .",
    "if at all possible to evaluate , it would be very interesting to see what the gfmc approach yields for the bosonic occupation numbers .",
    "on the experimental side , the bose condensate character is difficult to verify .",
    "however , we discussed heavy ion reactions and @xmath38be @xmath135be decay out of the @xmath136 state at 15.1 mev in @xmath5o as possible future indicators of @xmath1 particle condensation .",
    "also unusually low momenta of the decay products may give a hint .",
    "all in all , there exist many calculations , see , e.g. , @xcite which all point to the hoyle state as being dominated by s - waves among the 3@xmath1 s .",
    "we see no counter argument which would invalidate the hypothesis that the hoyle state is to a large extent composed of an @xmath1 particle condensate with 70 - 80 @xmath37 occupancy .",
    "these results are obtained from sophisticated but natural and transparent wave functions through a raleigh - ritz variational principle and the conclusions drawn from these investigations seem to us very reliable .",
    "additionally , there are clear theoretical indications that the 6-th @xmath3 at 15.1 mev in @xmath5o is a hoyle analog state .    in this review",
    ", we concentrated on the case of the hoyle state with only a small glimpse on the situation in @xmath5o .",
    "however , it seems clear that in heavier self - conjugate nuclei , like @xmath8ne , @xmath137 mg , up to @xmath117ca close to the @xmath1 disintegration threshold , analogous hoyle - like @xmath1 condensates may exist and that a whole series of excited states of which the bose condensate can be considered as the ground state ( see citation of uegaki above ) still is to be discovered and their precise nature to be clarified in the future .",
    "studies in this direction have been performed in @xcite using the gross - pitaevskii equation for bosons .",
    "it seems that around @xmath117ca the coulomb barrier fades away and no long lived @xmath1 condensate can exist any more .",
    "the @xmath1-like correlations and @xmath1 formation is also of importance for nuclei with @xmath1 decay like @xmath138po @xcite and superheavy nuclei .",
    "even the decay of heavier clusters has been observed like @xmath139ra into @xmath140pb @xmath141c and discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "@xmath8ne is similar to @xmath138po with an @xmath1 particle sitting on top of a doubly magic nucleus ( @xmath5o ) . in this respect",
    ", it is worth pointing out that already mean field approaches ( the independent particle model ) can show sizeable @xmath1 cluster correlations @xcite .",
    "we have argued that heavy ion reactions with detection of coherent @xmath1 particle motion have been seen in one or two works in the past @xcite and references in there .",
    "however , these reactions seem to be a largely unexploited territory concerning @xmath1 particle coherence and condensation .",
    "we also pointed out that coulomb excitation could be an ideal way of inducing important radial extension of a nucleus provoking ( @xmath1 ) clustering .",
    "a cartoon of a hypothetical coulomb explosion of @xmath117ca into ten @xmath1 s is shown in fig.[ca40explosion ] .",
    "it seems a truly exciting aspect that in the lighter n@xmath1 nuclei there is a coexistence of two almost ideal quantum gases : fermions ( nucleons ) and bosons ( @xmath1 particles ) .",
    "still many things have to be discovered in this context in future research where nuclear physics plays a prominent role . on the other hand ,",
    "cluster physics is also very developed concerning atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "however , so far , no bosonic condensation phenomena are discussed in this field , to the best of our knowledge .",

    "we thank very much our collaborators y. funaki and t. yamada who joined the @xmath1 particle cluster collaboration later but whose contributions have in several aspects been decisive .",
    "also very recent collaborations with z. ren , chang xu , mengjiao lyu , and bo zhou are strongly appreciated .",
