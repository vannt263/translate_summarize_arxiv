    "clarifying the nature of black holes in higher - dimensional spacetimes has become an important issue since the possibility of the black - hole production in accelerators was pointed out . if our space is the 3-brane in large @xcite or warped @xcite extra dimensions , the planck energy could be of @xmath0 that is accessible with the planned accelerators .",
    "if the number of dimension @xmath1 of our spacetime is actually larger than 4 , a black hole of very small mass will be produced artificially in particle experiments and the evidence may be detected .",
    "the possible phenomenology of the black holes which may be produced in accelerators was first discussed in @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) . during the high - energy particle collision of sufficiently small impact parameter in a higher - dimensional spacetime",
    ", two particles will form a distorted black hole of small mass .",
    "subsequently , it settles down to a stationary state after emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the stationary black hole will soon be evaporated by the hawking radiation , indicating that the quantum gravity effects will be important .",
    "the evaporation and quantum gravity effects @xcite have been studied for yielding a plausible scenario ( cf .",
    "@xcite for related issues ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the analyses for formation of the black hole and for the subsequent evolution by gravitational radiation are still in an early stage .",
    "these phases are described well in the context of general relativity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but due to its highly nonlinear nature , the detailed process has not been well understood .",
    "more specifically , two issues should be clarified for these phases .",
    "one is the condition ( i.e. , the impact parameter ) for formation of a black hole and the other is the fate of the formed black hole after emission of gravitational waves , which can be used as the initial condition of the hawking radiation phase .",
    "extensive effort has been made in the past five years for the first issue .",
    "the popular method is to approximate the high energy particle of no charge or spin by the aichelburg - sexl shock - wave metric @xcite .",
    "the merit of this approximation is that superimposing two aichelburg - sexl metrics , a metric of two particles moving with speed of light can be derived for a spacetime region in which causal connection between two particles is absent .",
    "although this solution can form a naked singularity at the collision and it is not clear what happens after the collision , it is still possible to determine the condition for the formation of an apparent horizon for a spacelike hypersurface of the known solution .",
    "formation of the apparent horizon is a sufficient condition for formation of a black hole for which the event horizon is outside the apparent horizon .",
    "thus , the lower bound of the impact parameter can be estimated .",
    "such study was first done by eardley and giddings @xcite in a four - dimensional case and it was extended to @xmath1-dimensional cases by yoshino and nambu @xcite . recently these studies were improved by yoshino and rychkov @xcite by analyzing the apparent horizon in a different spacelike hypersurface from the one in @xcite .",
    "the second issue is to clarify the final state of a black hole formed after collision of two particles , which will be a kerr black hole in higher dimensions , perhaps those described by myers and perry @xcite . here",
    ", the stationary kerr black holes of no electric charge are described by the mass and angular momentum .",
    "namely , the goal is to derive a formula of the final mass @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 as functions of the initial impact parameter and initial energy of two particles . for this issue ,",
    "a couple of preliminary analyses have been carried out so far ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "one is the work by yoshino and rychkov @xcite , who constrained the allowed region of the mass and angular momentum by finding the apparent horizon for spacetimes of two aichelburg - sexl particles and subsequently employing the area theorem .",
    "however , the allowed region can not be pinpointed with this approach , implying that the analysis of gravitational waves emitted during the collision is inevitable .",
    "the gravitational radiation from two particles with speed of light in head - on collision was first computed by death and payne @xcite ( summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "they analyzed a spacetime of two aichelburg - sexl particles in the @xmath4 case , paying attention only to a region far from the particles and using a perturbative theory . by this analysis",
    ", the radiation near the symmetric axis can be calculated .",
    "assuming the axisymmetric angular pattern of the radiation , they estimated the total radiated energy @xmath5 as 16% of the total energy of the system .",
    "recently , cardoso _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied gravitational radiation in the linear perturbation theory of the higher - dimensional flat spacetime .",
    "they found again that about 16% of the total energy will be emitted in the head - on collision for @xmath4 , which is consistent with the results by death and payne .",
    "they also found that the efficiency is highly suppressed for larger value of @xmath1 , e.g. , about @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the black hole perturbation theory has been also used recently .",
    "_ @xcite computed gravitational waves from a particle of energy @xmath8 with a speed close to the light speed falling straightforwardly into a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath9 for @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite extend their work for @xmath10 ( see @xcite for further generalizations ) . extrapolating the results for @xmath11",
    ", they found that the radiation efficiency is @xmath12 for @xmath4 and decreases with increasing the value of @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath13% for @xmath7 .",
    "although these approximate studies could give an approximate value of the radiation efficiency , it is natural to consider that the error in the estimate is still factor of 2 or more . to derive the exact numerical value , it is necessary to carry out more strict analysis .",
    "one promising approach is to employ numerical simulation in full general relativity . in the @xmath4 case ,",
    "simulation for black hole collision is feasible @xcite , producing certain scientific results .",
    "however , these works have been done for the case that velocity of each black hole is much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "formulation and numerical technique for black - hole collision with a very large lorentz factor @xmath14 have not been developed yet .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the so - called close - limit method for computing gravitational radiation , which was originally developed by price and pullin @xcite . in this method , we prepare two black holes of a small separation as the initial condition .",
    "if the separation is small enough to form a common horizon , the spacetime can be well approximated by a perturbed black - hole spacetime . as a result",
    ", the gravitational radiation during the collision can be analyzed in the context of the black - hole perturbation theory .",
    "this method has been applied for two black holes initially at rest @xcite , initially approaching with linear momentum @xcite , and many other two - black - hole systems @xcite .",
    "the robustness of this method is established by confirming that the results by this method agree with those in numerical relativity .",
    "this fact motivates us to adopt the close - limit approximation for high - velocity collision of two black holes in higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "as a first step toward the series of study for more plausible cases , in this paper , we focus on head - on collision with time - symmetric initial data of two equal - mass black holes . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose the brill and lindquist initial data @xcite that describes a spacelike hypersurface in a spacetime composed of three sheets connected by two einstein - rosen bridges .",
    "we will show that the successful numerical results and indicate that extension of the analyses with more general initial data is straightforward .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the brill - lindquist initial data and analyze the apparent horizons for @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the close - limit form of the initial data and briefly review the master equation for the perturbation of the higher - dimensional schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "we also explain our numerical methods .",
    "numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "iv , paying attention to the radiated energy and gravitational waveforms .",
    "section v is devoted to a summary . in appendix",
    "a , the gauge - invariant perturbation formalism as well as a method for preparing initial master variable from the brill - lindquist initial data are presented .",
    "appendix b describes a formula for computing the radiated energy of gravitational waves from the master variable .",
    "let @xmath16 denote a @xmath17-dimensional spacelike hypersurface @xmath18 with the metric @xmath19 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath20 in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the equations of the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ricci scalar of @xmath18 , @xmath24 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath19 , and @xmath25 . assuming the time symmetry ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) , eq . ( 2 ) is satisfied trivially . assuming further the conformal flatness @xmath27 , the hamiltonian constraint equation is written to the laplace equation for the conformal factor @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the flat - space laplacian .",
    "we introduce the cylindrical coordinates @xmath30 in which the flat - space metric is given by @xmath31 with the metric @xmath32 on the @xmath33-dimensional unit sphere . among an infinite number of solutions for eq .",
    "that denote spacetimes of two black holes , we choose the following one composed of two point sources located at @xmath34 along the @xmath35-axis as @xmath36^{n-1 } } \\left(\\frac{1}{r_-^{n-1}}+\\frac{1}{r_+^{n-1}}\\right ) , \\label{bl_solution}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the total gravitational mass of the system , and @xmath39 is the gravitational radius defined by @xmath40 here , @xmath41 is the @xmath42-dimensional area of a unit sphere .",
    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath39 as the unit of the length .",
    "the solution provides the system of three sheets connected by two einstein - rosen bridges . @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to spatial infinities of each sheet as found by brill and lindquist  @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "the close - limit approximation holds for the system sufficiently close to a stationary one - black - hole spacetime .",
    "thus , this method can be applied only for the case that a common apparent horizon surrounding two black holes is present .",
    "because of this reason , it is necessary to clarify the range of @xmath45 for which a common apparent horizon exists .",
    "also , by obtaining the area of the common apparent horizon , we can estimate the lower bound of the final mass as well as the upper bound of the energy radiated away by gravitational waves , using the area theorem of black holes .",
    "the common apparent horizon is determined by a numerical method developed by yoshino and nambu @xcite . since the system is axisymmetric , it is easily determined by a simple shooting method .",
    "the shape of the common apparent horizon changes from a sphere at @xmath46 to a spheroid for @xmath47 , increasing the ellipticity . at a critical value , @xmath48 , it disappears .",
    "the values of @xmath48 are summarized in table  [ z0-crit ] .",
    ".the critical values of @xmath48 for formation of a common apparent horizon for @xmath49 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ qnm - l6 ]    our methods can be applied to arbitrary values of @xmath50 . to estimate @xmath51",
    ", we evolved appropriate initial data for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for these cases , only one quasinormal frequency appears in the ring down phase and the error of @xmath51 is @xmath54 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "our results together with those in the previous studies are summarized in tables  [ qnm - l4 ] and [ qnm - l6 ] .",
    "they agree well within the difference @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that evolving appropriate initial data by the master equation is an effective method for computation of the complex frequencies of the fundamental quasinormal modes .",
    "in this paper , we have studied gravitational waves emitted during head - on collision of two black holes in higher dimensions using the close - limit approximation .",
    "we evolved the brill - lindquist initial data perturbatively , using a gauge - invariant techniques in a schwarzschild black hole and calculated the waveform and radiated energy @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 is given by the formula   and the values of @xmath55 are summarized in table  [ ehat ] . at the critical separation for the presence of the common apparent horizon @xmath56 , our analysis of the first order perturbation predicts that @xmath57 becomes larger with larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "there is a possibility that the higher - order correction is large for @xmath56 in the higher - dimensional cases and to clarify the higher - order effect is left as a remaining problem .",
    "we also evaluated the values of @xmath58 at @xmath59 and found that @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is larger than @xmath62 .",
    "these results indicate that more energy could be radiated away in higher dimensional spacetimes than in the four dimensional one during head - on collision with the approaching velocity much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "it has also been illustrated that the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for the scalar - mode perturbation in the schwarzschild black holes can be computed in our analysis .",
    "we derived the complex frequencies for various values of @xmath1 , which have not been accurately computed so far .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the close - limit analysis for head - on collision of the black holes performed in this paper is the first step toward more general studies of the black hole collision in higher dimensions . as the next step",
    ", we plan to analyze the evolution of two initially - moving black holes using the close - slow approximation .",
    "both the head - on collisions and the grazing collisions should be studied . as the momentum of each black hole increases , dependence of the emissivity of gravitational waves on the value of @xmath1",
    "would be changed from the results in this paper . by observing such behaviors",
    ", we will be able to discuss the dependence of gravitational radiation in the collision process on the value of @xmath1 in a different way from the previous studies .",

    "<S> motivated by the tev - scale gravity scenarios , we study gravitational radiation in the head - on collision of two black holes in higher dimensional spacetimes using a close - limit approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we prepare time - symmetric initial data sets for two black holes ( the so - called brill - lindquist initial data ) and numerically evolve the spacetime in terms of a gauge invariant formulation for the perturbation around the higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the waveform and radiated energy of gravitational waves emitted in the head - on collision are clarified . </S>",
    "<S> also , the complex frequencies of fundamental quasinormal modes of higher - dimensional schwarzschild black holes , which have not been accurately derived so far , are determined . </S>"
