    "transverse knots play an important role in contact topology , but surprisingly little is known about their classification even in the simplest setting , @xmath2 with the standard contact structure .",
    "any transverse knot has an underlying topological knot type , and it also carries at least one other piece of data , the self - linking number .",

    "transversely nonsimple_. various knots are known to be transversely simple , including the unknot @xcite , torus knots @xcite , and the figure eight knot @xcite .",
    "it was only recently that some knot types were shown to be transversely nonsimple .",
    "birman and menasco @xcite ( see also @xcite ) used braid theory to find a family of @xmath3-braids whose knot closures are transversely nonsimple ; etnyre and honda @xcite used contact - topological techniques to show that the @xmath4 cable of the @xmath4 torus knot is transversely nonsimple .",
    "there has been much current effort to develop invariants of transverse knots that can be used to demonstrate transverse nonsimplicity .",
    "the first ( and thus far only ) invariant that has been shown to be effective lies , interestingly , not in contact - topological constructions like symplectic field theory , but in knot floer homology @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 invariant in @xmath6 was introduced by ozsvth , szab , and thurston @xcite and was employed in @xcite to find several examples of transversely nonsimple knots , including @xmath0 and ( a reproof of ) the etnyre ",
    "honda cable example .",
    "vrtesi @xcite used the examples of @xcite and the behavior of @xmath5 under connected sum to find infinite families of connected - sum examples of transversely nonsimple knots ; see also @xcite .",
    "most recently , by studying the relationship between contact surgery and naturality properties of ( a differently constructed version of ) @xmath5 , ozsvth and stipsicz @xcite proved transverse nonsimplicity for a wide family of two - bridge knots",
    ".    absent the naturality techniques of @xcite , the applications of @xmath5 to transverse simplicity have used a crude but surprisingly effective `` vanishing criterion '' : if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are transverse knots and @xmath9 while @xmath10 , then @xmath7 and @xmath8 are distinct .",
    "the @xmath5 invariant lies in the homology of a combinatorial chain complex introduced in @xcite , and @xcite used a computer program to determine in examples whether @xmath5 is null - homologous or not .",

    ", we find a two - parameter infinite family of prime , transversely nonsimple knots that can be distinguished using the vanishing criterion for @xmath5 .",

    "the resulting family of examples is not as simple in appearance as the two - bridge examples of @xcite , but has the advantage of needing only the combinatorial description of @xmath5 and not an analysis of its image under contact surgery .",
    "our family is a generalization of the @xmath0 example from @xcite .",
    "a transverse knot can be represented as a braid ( see section  [ ssec : braids ] ) , and a fruitful technique for finding transversely nonsimple knots is to find braids that are related by a negative flype ( cf .",

    "we have checked several examples using the computer program of @xcite but do not have a general proof for the case @xmath27 .    in order to apply the @xmath5 invariant to braids to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] , we need techniques for translating between braids , grid diagrams , and legendrian and transverse knots in standard contact @xmath2 .",

    "there is a many - to - one correspondence between legendrian and transverse knots .",
    "any legendrian knot @xmath33 can be perturbed to a transverse knot @xmath34 , the _ positive pushoff _ of @xmath33 , by pushing each point on @xmath33 in a direction transverse to the contact plane ; the positive pushoff is unique up to transverse isotopy .",
    "there is an `` inverse '' operation that perturbs any transverse knot to a legendrian knot , but this is only well - defined up to legendrian isotopy and negative stabilization / destabilization of legendrian knots ( see below ) .",
    "thus one can view transverse knots up to transverse isotopy as legendrian knots up to legendrian isotopy and negative de / stabilization .",
    "a convenient way to depict legendrian and transverse knots is through their _ front projections _ to the @xmath35 plane .",
    "the front projection of a generic legendrian knot has no vertical tangencies and has only double points and semicubical cusps as singularities . at each double point",
    ", the arc of more negative slope passes over the arc of more positive slope .",

    "the front projection of a generic transverse knot is a standard knot diagram , with only double points as singularities , but with two restrictions : any point in the projection with a vertical tangency must be oriented upwards , and at a crossing , we can not simultaneously have the overcrossing arc pointing to the left , the undercrossing arc pointing to the right , and the overcrossing arc of greater slope than the undercrossing arc .",
    "see figure  [ fig : forbidden ] .",
    "any knot projection without these forbidden segments is the front projection of a transverse knot , unique up to transverse isotopy , and two transverse knots are transversely isotopic if and only if their front projections are isotopic through diagrams that do not contain any forbidden segments .        with front projections",
    ", it is easy to see the correspondence between legendrian and transverse knots .",
    "the front of a legendrian knot can be turned into the front of its positive transverse pushoff by smoothing out upward - pointing cusps and replacing downward - pointing cusps by loops ; see figure  [ fig : pushoff ] . in a related vein",
    ", we define the _ positive _ and _ negative stabilizations _ @xmath36 of a legendrian knot @xmath33 to be the legendrian knots whose fronts are obtained from the front of @xmath33 by adding in a zigzag whose cusps point downward or upward ; see figure  [ fig : stab ] .",
    "both stabilizations are well - defined up to legendrian isotopy .",
    "it is clear from the front picture that a legendrian knot and its negative stabilization have positive transverse pushoffs that are transversely isotopic .",
    "a result due in the @xmath2 case to @xcite states that two legendrian knots are related by legendrian isotopy and negative de / stabilization if and only if their positive transverse pushoffs are related by transverse isotopy .          closely related to front projections is another fruitful method of representing legendrian knots , via grid diagrams .",
    "a _ grid diagram _ is an @xmath37 square grid with a collection of @xmath38 @xmath39 s and @xmath38 @xmath40 s in the grid , such that each row or column contains exactly one @xmath39 and one @xmath40 , and no square in the grid contains both an @xmath39 and an @xmath40 .",
    "one obtains a knot ( or link ) diagram from a grid diagram by connecting @xmath40 s to @xmath39 s horizontally , connecting @xmath39 s to @xmath40 s vertically , and stipulating that horizontal segments always pass over vertical segments whenever they cross .",
    "( note that this is the opposite of the standard convention for grid diagrams . ) in this way , any knot can be represented by a grid diagram .",
    "indeed , we can view a grid diagram @xmath41 as ( the front of ) a legendrian knot @xmath42 by turning it @xmath43 clockwise , smoothing upward- and downward - pointing corners , and turning leftward- and rightward - pointing corners into cusps .",

    "we can define transverse knots for @xmath47 in the same way as transverse knots for @xmath30 , and @xmath45 sends a knot tranverse to @xmath47 to a knot transverse to @xmath30 .",

    "braids that are conjugate in the braid group yield transversely isotopic knots .",
