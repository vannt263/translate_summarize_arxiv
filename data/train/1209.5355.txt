    "the intense interest in understanding the interplay between superconductors ( s ) and ferromagnets ( f ) was primarily triggered by the pioneering work of ryazanov _",
    "et al._,@xcite who showed that the supercurrent in a s / f / s junction containing the weak ferromagnet cuni was periodically modulated : first by temperature as a result of varying the exchange energy of the low curie temperature cuni , and also in the function of the cuni thickness.@xcite the oscillating and decay lengths of the thickness modulation are much shorter ( @xmath0 1 nm ) if a strong ferromagnet is used , such as co,@xcite fe,@xcite or ni,@xcite but because of their long mean free paths for both scattering and spin flip they are attractive materials to use in s / f / s junctions . for a detailed review on the singlet proximity coupling of s and f materials",
    "see ref . and references therein .",
    "the decay lengths of supercurrents in ferromagnets can be radically extended if the electron pairs transform from a singlet to a triplet spin state at a s / f interface via a spin - mixing process .",
    "this is known as the long - range triplet proximity effect ; for a comprehensive review , see ref . and references therein .",
    "one way to theoretically promote the spin - mixing conversion between singlet pairs and triplet pairs at a s / f interface is to incorporate a magnetically inhomogenous layer between the s and f layers.@xcite the triplet electron pairs which form are expected to be much more robust in ferromagnets , with longer coherence lengths ( @xmath1 1 nm ) than pairs in a singlet state .",
    "therefore the demonstration of a supercurrent in a s / f / s junction where the f layer thickness exceeds any length scale possible for a singlet pair to exist is considered indirect proof of the long - range triplet proximity effect .",
    "signatures of such a long - range proximity effect were first reported more than two decades ago ( see , e.g. ref . ) .",
    "however , it was only in 2006 when the first major breakthrough was achieved with supercurrents reported in planar josephson devices with half - metallic ( i.e. , fully spin polarized ) barriers that were hundreds of nanometers long;@xcite see also the related articles in ref . .",
    "in the same year , a triplet superconducting state was also reported in ho , a helimagnetic rare - earth metal , which formed the junction of a superconducting interferometer.@xcite these results stimulated intense theoretical work aimed at understanding triplet supercurrents better and how they could be created at s / f interfaces in a more routine way .    over the past year it would seem that the puzzle to control triplet pair generation in s / f / s devices was finally solved with long - ranged supercurrents consistent with spin - triplet theory demonstrated in a wide range of ferromagnets,@xcite including a co / ru / co synthetic antiferromagnet interfaced by normal ( i.e. , non - magnetic ) metal spacers and ferromagnetic alloys@xcite ( see also ref . ) ; a ho / co / ho composite barrier@xcite ( see also refs . ) ; a magnetic cu@xmath2mnal heusler compound with a complex magnetic profile@xcite ( see also ref . ) ; a half - metallic cro@xmath2 wire;@xcite and a co nanowire.@xcite in addition to these experiments , superconducting gap features have been very recently measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite in the half - metallic manganite la@xmath3ca@xmath4mno@xmath5 ( lcmo ) grown on yba@xmath2cu@xmath5o@xmath6 .",
    "the gap features were observed in the lcmo up to a thickness of approximately 30 nm , and so offer the potential to explore the fundamental properties of a triplet superconducting state .",
    "the experiments reported in refs . , , and share many similarities with the theoretical triplet junction proposed by houzet and buzdin:@xcite a s / f@xmath7/f / f@xmath8/s junction in which the magnetizations in the f@xmath7 and f@xmath8 layers are non - collinear with the magnetization in the f layer , allowing control over the creation of triplet electron pairs . our group reported josephson devices in which the f@xmath7 and f@xmath8 layers were substituted by ho and the f layer used was co.@xcite the maximum supercurrent ( i.e.",
    ", the josephson critical current @xmath9 ) in these devices was found to depend non - monotonically on the thickness @xmath10 of each ho layer , with peaks in @xmath9 when @xmath11 4.5 nm and @xmath11 10 nm .",
    "these thicknesses appeared to correspond to an optimum spin - triplet proximity effect , and by increasing the co thickness @xmath12 in the 0@xmath1316 nm range , a slow decay in @xmath9 was observed with a decay length of @xmath14 10 nm at 4.2 k. this decay length is almost ten times larger than that found in simple ( spin - singlet dominated ) co - based josephson devices.@xcite alidoust and linder@xcite established theoretically that spin - triplet supercurrents could account for the slow decay in @xmath9 with @xmath12 , but their model did not account for the complex dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath10 .",
    "when rare - earth ferromagnets are grown on transition - metal ferromagnets , it is well known that the two materials magnetically couple at the interface . in view of this fact",
    ", we solve the eilenberger equation for an ideal s / hm / f / hm / s josephson device with arbitrary interfacial magnetic coupling at the hm / f interfaces , and demonstrate a profound dependence of the triplet supercurrent amplitude on the thicknesses of the hm layers .",
    "the results provide a new level of understanding into the conversion process between singlet and triplet cooper pairing at a superconductor / helimagnet / ferromagnet interface .",
    "the s / hm / f / hm / s device considered in this paper is illustrated in fig . [ fig-1 ] .",
    "all layers are normal to the @xmath15 direction .",
    "the hm layers have a thickness @xmath10 and their magnetization rotates in the @xmath16 plane as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the strongly ferromagnetic f layer has a thickness @xmath12 and a uniform magnetization in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "the s layers at @xmath18 and @xmath19 are infinitely thick and in a singlet state .",
    "subscripts @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 refer to the hm , f , and s layers .",
    "we assume a moderately clean limit and a temperature close to the critical temperature @xmath23 of the superconducting leads , therefore we adapt the linearized eilenberger equation ( lee ) . due to the presence of non - uniform magnetization",
    ", we consider both singlet and triplet correlations .",
    "the anomalous green s function is then a @xmath24 matrix given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a vector of the pauli matrices . the component @xmath28 is associated with spin - singlet pairs , while the three components in @xmath29 are associated with spin - triplet pairs . to understand the meaning of the different triplet components , we switch to an alternative representation where we have @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the components @xmath33 and @xmath34 then correspond to triplet pairs with spin projections @xmath35 and @xmath36 to the @xmath37 direction , respectively .",
    "since the hm layers have a weak magnetization , all components in @xmath38 are non - zero .",
    "the fermi surface average is @xmath39 in the moderately clean limit@xcite and so the lee reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the anticommutator , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the fermi velocity and the pair - breaking time in a generic layer @xmath44 .",
    "the electron mean free path is then @xmath45 .",
    "the matsubara frequencies are given by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the magnetic exchange field in units of frequency .",
    "this field takes the form @xmath48 , \\sin [ q \\tilde{z } + \\alpha ] , 0)$ ] in the hm layers , where @xmath49 is the wave vector of the magnetic helix . the magnetic exchange coupling at the hm / f interfaces is included by introducing an anisotropy angle @xmath50 between the local magnetizations of the hm and f layers .",
    "when @xmath50 is 0 or @xmath51 , the magnetizations are locally parallel or antiparallel , respectively .",
    "the hm magnetization rotates too much as @xmath52 and when @xmath53 it does not rotate enough .",
    "the symmetry in the definition of @xmath54 assumes that the helicities of the two hm layers are opposite .",
    "it turns out that reversing the helicity of one layer only gives an overall minus sign in the expression for the critical current , which is not measurable . ]",
    "radians between the f and hm layer moments ( @xmath55 in the figure).,width=264 ]    for the strongly magnetized f layer there are two independent spin bands for the majority ( @xmath17 ) and the minority ( @xmath56 ) spins , and the singlet correlations are destroyed on a sub - nanometer scale .",
    "therefore we take @xmath57 and identify the remaining components @xmath34 with triplet pairs from the majority and minority spin bands . the governing equations for the two independent spin bands",
    "are then @xmath58 where we assume @xmath59 . however ,",
    "since scattering is mainly due to impurities at low temperatures , we assume that the pair - breaking time @xmath60 is the same for both spin bands .    at the interface @xmath61 between two generic layers @xmath44 and @xmath62 , the parallel component of the fermi momentum",
    "is conserved .",
    "if we assume that all bands are parabolic with the same effective electron mass , the fermi momentum is proportional to the fermi velocity , meaning @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath65 , it is valid to use the single - channel approximation ; the anomalous green s function @xmath38 is then only non - zero for angles close to @xmath35 or @xmath51 in the hm and f layers , therefore @xmath66 can be substituted by @xmath67 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - gen - hm ] ) and ( [ eq - gen - fm ] ) .",
    "the phase difference between the two s layers is @xmath68 and the magnitude @xmath69 of the bulk pairing potentials ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) is determined from the self - consistency equation . for @xmath71 , we can apply rigid boundary conditions at the s / hm interfaces.@xcite this means that @xmath38 is the same at the interface as in the bulk of the s layers for outgoing directions .",
    "the boundary conditions at the s / hm interfaces are then @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the equilibrium value of @xmath28 and the subscript @xmath22 indicates that the expressions correspond to the s side of the interface .    in the formalism of the lee ,",

    "the function @xmath80 satisfies the same equations as @xmath38 with the same boundary conditions at the interfaces , reversed exchange field ( @xmath81 ) in the hm layers , and exchanged spin bands ( @xmath82 ) in the f layer .",
    "in this section we calculate the josephson current at the s side of the @xmath83 interface and hence obtain the critical current of the junction .",
    "since @xmath84 for @xmath85 is known and only its @xmath28 component is non - zero , the josephson current is determined entirely by @xmath86 for @xmath87 . due to the linearity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - gen - hm ] ) and ( [ eq - gen - fm ] ) , we can write @xmath88 @xmath89 where the different matrices / vectors @xmath90 describe the effects of the different layers between @xmath91 and @xmath83 .",
    "the role played by the hm layers is to convert between the singlet component @xmath28 in the s layers and the triplet components @xmath34 in the f layer , implying @xmath92 is a @xmath93 vector , while @xmath94 is a @xmath95 vector .",

    "physically , the parameter @xmath102 describes the conversion efficiency between singlet and triplet cooper pairs in each hm layer , while @xmath103 describes the total efficiency of both hm layers .    since the non - zero triplet components @xmath34 are independent in the f layer",

    ". if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq - curr - s-1 ] ) and @xmath114 ( for @xmath75 ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq - gen - curr ] ) , we recover the usual current - phase relation , @xmath115 , and the critical current density becomes @xmath116 .",
    "\\label{eq - curr - jc}\\ ] ] the integral in @xmath117 gives @xmath118 , while the sum in @xmath119 requires a further approximation . since @xmath120 for all layers and all matsubara frequencies with a significant contribution , we can neglect @xmath119 next to @xmath121 in @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that @xmath123 and that @xmath124 is independent of @xmath119 as well .",
    "the sum is now evaluated using @xmath125 and so the characteristic voltage reads @xmath126 @xmath127 the two terms in the sum are contributions from triplet pairs traveling through the majority and minority spin bands of the f layer , respectively .",
    "since only triplet pairs can enter the strongly ferromagnetic f layer , the conversion between singlet and triplet pairs in the hm layers is crucial .",
    "this process is represented by the efficiency parameter @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - curr - ic-2 ] ) and in this section we discuss how the conversion depends on @xmath10 , @xmath128 , and @xmath50 .     peaks at particular hm layer thicknesses ( a ) , and the positions and magnitudes of these peaks depend on the magnetic anisotropy angle @xmath50 between neighboring hm and f layer moments ( a , b ) .",
    "in ( a ) and ( b ) , @xmath129 . for optimum hm layer thicknesses ,",
    "the maximum efficiency parameter @xmath130 depends sensitively on @xmath128 and @xmath50 ( c).,width=264 ]    we first note from eq .",
    "( [ eq - curr - b ] ) that @xmath103 is @xmath51 periodic in the anisotropy angle @xmath50 .",
    "this implies that the critical current does not distinguish between locally parallel and antiparallel magnetizations of the hm and f layers . in both of these cases ,",
    "the efficiency parameter takes the form @xmath131 which shows that the periodicity of @xmath103 in @xmath10 is in general @xmath132 .",
    "the periodicity @xmath133 depends on the two intrinsic length scales of the hm layers : the oscillating length @xmath134 and the wavelength @xmath135 of the magnetic helix .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eq - disc - b-1 ] ) shows that the shorter length scale is the dominant one .",
    "when the oscillating length is small ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) , we have @xmath137 and so the helical structure becomes irrelevant .",
    "the periodicity is determined by @xmath134 as for uniform magnets . when the oscillating length is large ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) , we have @xmath139 and so that the periodicity is determined entirely by the helical structure",
    ". it also follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq - disc - b-1 ] ) that the zeros of @xmath103 are at @xmath140 , and that its maxima are halfway between its zeros .",
    "if we start increasing @xmath50 , the periodicity @xmath141 remains unchanged , and @xmath103 still has zeros at @xmath142 .",
    "however , the primary maxima halfway are shifted to the left , and secondary maxima appear with additional zeros in between ( see fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "when the local hm and f magnetizations are orthogonal , the efficiency parameter reads @xmath143 the primary and secondary maxima become equivalent , the periodicity in @xmath10 is reduced by @xmath144 , and the zeros of @xmath103 occur at @xmath145 .",
    "it is interesting to look at the efficiency of the singlet / triplet conversion at optimal hm layer thicknesses .",
    "this is determined by @xmath128 and @xmath50 . in the limit when @xmath138 , the critical current vanishes .",
    "this is because if @xmath146 is too small , the hm magnetization averages to zero within the length scale of @xmath134 . in the opposite limit when @xmath136",
    ", we need @xmath147 for @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath146 is too large , the hm layers become uniformly magnetized , and we recover the results in ref . as @xmath149 . to be more quantitative ,",
    "we maximize @xmath103 with respect to @xmath10 ; this calculation gives @xmath150 and the dependence of @xmath151 on @xmath128 and @xmath50 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-2](c ) .",
    "we can establish that the most efficient singlet / triplet conversion with @xmath152 occurs whenever @xmath153 .",
