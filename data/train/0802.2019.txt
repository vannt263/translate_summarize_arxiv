    "the relation between the state of a composite quantum system as a whole and the configuration of its parts is a very peculiar feature of quantum theory .",
    "as recognized since the early stages of development of the theory  @xcite , this is a consequence of the tensor product structure of the state space of a composite quantum system .",
    "this feature of quantum mechanics has its most evident manifestation in the fact that it allows the presence of non - classical correlations , i.e.  of _ entanglement _ , between the subsystems of a composite system .",
    "nowadays , we may say that quantum entanglement is not only regarded as a key for the interpretation of quantum mechanics or as a mere scientific curiosity , but also as a fundamental resource for quantum information , communication and computation tasks  @xcite .",
    "however , despite the great efforts made by the scientific community in the past decades , there are still several open issues regarding the mathematical characterization of composite quantum states , even in the ` elementary case ' of a bipartite system with a finite number of levels .",
    "a major challenge is to characterize those states of a bipartite system that are entangled . according to the definition due to r.f .",
    "werner  @xcite , _ entangled _ ( mixed ) states differ from _ separable _ states since they can not be prepared , not even in principle , from product states by means of local operations and classical communication only . in mathematical terms , a ( mixed ) state @xmath0  a positive ( trace class ) operator of unit trace  in a composite hilbert space @xmath1 is called _ separable _ if it can be represented as a convex sum of product states : @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; otherwise , @xmath0 is said to be _ entangled_. we remark that , if @xmath0 is separable , decomposition  ( [ separable ] ) is in general not unique , and the smallest number of terms in the sum ( usually called _ cardinality _ ) , due to caratheodory s theorem , is not larger than the squared dimension of the _ total _ hilbert space of the system @xmath5 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "since quantum entanglement is a very important subject , also in view of its several potential applications , separability criteria are regarded as extremely precious tools . among a plethora of proposed separability criteria",
    " i.e.  suitable conditions satisfied by all separable states whose violation allows to detect entanglement ( see , for instance , @xcite )  the present contribution is mainly inspired by the criterion that was proposed in  @xcite with the name of ` realignment criterion ' ( rc ) and in  @xcite with the name of ` computable cross norm ' criterion . as we will try to argue , the rc brings attention to the role played by the _",
    "schmidt coefficients _",
    "@xcite of a bipartite quantum state in the characterization of entanglement . trying to shed light on",
    "this role will be the main goal of our contribution .",
    "the paper develops along the following lines . in section  [ class : def ] , we introduce a ` schmidt equivalence relation ' in the set of states of a bipartite quantum system , and we show the link between this notion and the rc . section  [ class : study ] is devoted to the characterization of the schmidt equivalence classes .",
    "we follow two different approaches : the characterization of some groups acting on the schmidt equivalence classes and the analysis of the local geometry of these equivalence classes regarded as manifolds .",
    "a family of separability criteria is presented in section  [ ideas ] , which are extensions of the rc .",
    "these criteria are based on the ` symmetric polynomials ' in the schmidt coefficients , and are weaker than the parent criterion . in section  [ duality ] , the well known correspondence between quantum states and quantum maps ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e.  completely positive trace - preserving ( cpt ) maps , is considered , and a straightforward application of the derived family of separability criteria to the study of cpt maps is discussed . through this correspondence , separable states are associated to entanglement breaking ( eb ) channels  @xcite .",
    "the proposed family of criteria , applied to this context , leads to a purely geometrical characterization of eb maps . in section",
    "[ new ] , we formulate the conjecture that the proposed criteria can be strengthened in order to obtain new necessary conditions for separability which are independent of the parent rc . numerical examples in support of this thesis are provided in section  [ examples ] for low dimensional bipartite systems .",
    "let us consider a bipartite , finite - dimensional , complex hilbert space @xmath1  @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8  and the corresponding real vector spaces of hermitian operators @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( the spaces of observables ) in @xmath5 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , that are naturally endowed with a scalar product , namely , the _ bilinear _ hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) product : @xmath14 in particular , the _ density operators _  i.e.  the positive operators of unit trace  in @xmath5 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) can be regarded as elements of the real vector space @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) , in which they form a convex body that will be denoted by @xmath15 . observe that @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the hs product allows to write a ( nonunique ) _ schmidt decomposition _",
    "@xcite of a density operator @xmath19 , i.e. admits a schmidt decomposition . ]",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 and the real positive numbers @xmath22 are the ( uniquely determined ) _ schmidt coefficients _ ( in short , sc s ) .",
    "note that the number of terms in the sum equals @xmath23 ( we will also set @xmath24 ) .",
    "the definition of the sc s of a bipartite density operator is the natural generalization of the standard definition for pure states ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , since the operators forming the orthonormal systems @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ) are hermitian , the operators @xmath27 are _",
    "observables_. hence  at least in principle  _ the sc s are physically measurable quantities _ :",
    "@xmath28 the set of ` local ' operators @xmath29 are also referred to as _",
    "local orthogonal observables _",
    "decomposition  ( [ state ] ) has been recently considered  see  @xcite  in connection with the formulation of new separability criteria .",
    "we observe that the convex body @xmath15 can also be regarded as immersed in the _ complex _ vector space @xmath30 of linear operators in @xmath5 , vector space that can be endowed with the _ sesquilinear _ hs product ( denoted , again , as @xmath31 ) .",
    "then , one can consider a schmidt decomposition of a density operator @xmath0 in @xmath5 with respect to the complex hilbert space @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that such a decomposition will contain the same sc s as decomposition  ( [ state ] ) , but this time will involve an orthonormal system of , in general , non - hermitian operators .    given a bipartite density operator , one can uniquely determine its sc s .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that the sc s do not identify a unique quantum state .",
    "it is then natural to formulate the following definition :    [ sch - equiv ] we say that two bipartite density operators are schmidt equivalent if they share the same set of schmidt coefficients .",
    "then the convex set of density operator in the hilbert space @xmath5  which will be denoted by @xmath15  is partitioned into schmidt equivalence classes .",
    "it is known that a bipartite _ pure _ state is completely characterized , with respect to entanglement , by the corresponding sc s  @xcite .",
    "although the same characterization can not be extended to a generic state , it is reasonable to suppose that there exists some relation between the sc s of a bipartite density operator and the entanglement properties of this state , and to address the following questions : _  what relevant properties are encoded by the sc s of a bipartite density operator , and how one can characterize the schmidt equivalence classes ? \" _ in the following , we will try to analyze these questions and to provide some reasonable answers .",
    "a first observation is that the sc s determine the _ purity _ of a state .",
    "let us recall that the purity is defined as the trace of the square of the density operator : @xmath32 hence , @xmath330,1]$ ] , @xmath34 .",
    "it follows from the definition of schmidt decomposition that the purity equals the sum of the squares of the sc s :",
    "@xmath35 thus , the purity is the simplest property which is ( completely ) described by the sc s of a density operator .",
    "another relevant fact is the existence of a link between the separability of a density operator and its sc s .",
    "indeed , the ` realignment criterion ' ( in short rc see  @xcite ; see also  @xcite , where a generalization of the rc is obtained ) establishes a necessary condition for the separability of a quantum state ( or a sufficient condition for the nonseparability ) .",
    "it can be formulated in various equivalent ways . from our point of view , it can be regarded as a condition on the sc s of a separable density operator @xmath0 .",
    "precisely , it imposes an upper bound for the sum of its sc s :    if a bipartite density operator @xmath0 is separable , then its schmidt coefficients @xmath22 satisfy the following inequality : @xmath36    the rc is easily implementable . in particular , in  @xcite it has been introduced the notion of a _ realigned matrix _ @xmath37 associated with the bipartite density operator @xmath0 in order to compute the l.h.s .  of inequality  ( [ rc_cond ] ) .",
    "fixed orthonormal bases @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the local hilbert spaces @xmath12 , @xmath13 , respectively , and assuming that @xmath40 is the representative matrix of the density operator @xmath0 with respect to the product basis @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are double indexes  the corresponding realigned matrix ( with respect to the given basis ) is defined as @xmath44 it turns out that the sc s of @xmath0 are the _ singular values _ of the realigned matrix @xmath37 , see  @xcite .",
    "precisely , consider a _",
    "singular value decomposition _ of the realigned matrix , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are unitary matrices , belonging respectively to the unitary groups @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is a rectangular matrix such that its nonvanishing entries are positive and placed along the principal diagonal only .",
    "then , the diagonal entries of @xmath50 are the singular values of @xmath37 , hence , the sc s of @xmath0 . at this point , observing that the singular values of the realigned matrix @xmath37 coincide with the eigenvalues of the positive matrix @xmath51 , one concludes that inequality  ( [ rc_cond ] ) can also be written as @xmath52    given a density operator @xmath19 , we will denote by @xmath53 the schmidt equivalence class containing @xmath0 . beside the schmidt equivalence class @xmath53 , we will consider the _ extended schmidt equivalence class _ containing @xmath0 , namely , the set @xmath54 of all the hermitian operators in @xmath5 that share with @xmath0 the same set of schmidt coefficients .",
    "thus , we have that @xmath55 .",
    "aim of the present section is to give a basic characterization of the schmidt equivalence classes of states ; see definition  [ sch - equiv ] . in this regard",
    ", one can adopt two different approaches .",
    "on one hand , one can try to characterize some ` natural ' groups for which an action on the schmidt equivalence classes is defined ; see subsection  [ local_maps ] . on the other hand , one can regard the schmidt equivalence classes as manifolds and study their local geometry considering the action of the local orthogonal groups ; see subsection  [ local - analysis ] .",
    "although the results that we obtain are still somewhat ` preliminary ' , we think that it is worthwhile to report them since a description of schmidt equivalence classes seems to be completely missing in the literature .",
    "note that , since @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are _ real _ hilbert spaces , the unitary ( super)operators in these spaces belong to orthogonal groups . for instance , a unitary operator in @xmath9 belongs to the orthogonal group @xmath56 .",
    "the class of unitary operators in @xmath9 that are decomposable as the tensor product of two unitary operators in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively  i.e.  of the form @xmath57 , with @xmath58 in @xmath59 , @xmath60 in @xmath61  will be denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "it is clear that the maps in @xmath62 preserve the sc s of every element of @xmath9 , but , in general , @xmath63 .",
    "note , moreover , that the set @xmath62 is a group ( isomorphic to the direct product @xmath64 ) with respect to the usual composition of maps .",

    "let @xmath75 be a schmidt decomposition of @xmath0 and @xmath76 a schmidt decomposition of an arbitrary element @xmath77 of @xmath54 . then",
    ", for every couple of unitary operators @xmath58 and @xmath60 in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we have : @xmath81 . hence , @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83    the set of all the maps of the form @xmath57  with @xmath58 and @xmath60 unitary operators in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively  such that @xmath53 is _ stable _ under the action of @xmath84 , i.e.  such that @xmath85 is a semigroup ( with respect to composition ) with identity , contained in the group @xmath62 , semigroup which will be denoted by @xmath86 .",
    "the subset @xmath87 of @xmath86 defined by @xmath88 is a group .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath87 coincides with the subset of @xmath86 containing those maps that leave @xmath53 _ invariant _ , i.e. @xmath89 as an example of an operator belonging to @xmath87 , for all @xmath19 , consider the linear map @xmath90 , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 unitary operators defined by : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are ` local ' _ complex conjugations _ ( i.e.selfadjoint antiunitary operators ) in @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the maps @xmath94 and @xmath95 are partial transpositions , so that the map @xmath96 is the transposition associated with a tensor product basis in @xmath97 ( recall that transposition , as complex conjugation , is a basis - dependent notion ) . as it is well known , a transposition is a _ positive trace - preserving _ map ( in short , pt map ) , and it is selfadjoint with respect to the hs scalar product . therefore , the selfadjoint unitary operator @xmath96 is contained in the group @xmath87 , for all @xmath19 .",
    "it is natural to wonder how states belonging to the same schmidt equivalence class can be connected by physically realizable transformations .",
    "we will then consider the semigroup with identity of pt maps in @xmath9 , which will be denoted by @xmath98 .",
    "it is worth defining the following subset of @xmath98 : @xmath99 it is clear that the set @xmath100 is a group .",
    "as already observed , unitary maps in @xmath9 of the form @xmath101  with @xmath58 and @xmath60 unitary operators in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively  preserve the sc s of every element of @xmath9 , but , in general , @xmath63 .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the class of linear maps in @xmath9 belonging to the set @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear that this set is a semigroup ( with respect to composition of maps ) with identity contained in @xmath86 .",
    "we will show now that it is actually a group which is a subgroup of @xmath87 .",
    "we need two preliminary results ; the proof of the first one is trivial .",
    "[ primo ] the inverse of a bijective trace - preserving map from @xmath9 onto @xmath9 is trace - preserving .    [ secondo ] a positive linear map @xmath103 which is unitary transforms the convex cone of positive operators in @xmath5 onto itself ; therefore , @xmath104 is a positive map .",
    "hence , in particular , if a linear map belonging to @xmath62 is a positive map , then its inverse is a positive map too .",
    "* proof : * we will prove the statement by contradiction .",
    "suppose that @xmath105 is positive , and assume that @xmath106 is not a positive operator .",
    "then , for some @xmath107 , we should have that @xmath108 ; hence , @xmath109 , where we have used the unitarity of @xmath72 . on the other hand , since @xmath72 is a positive injective linear map , @xmath110 is a nonzero positive operator , so that it admits a decomposition of the form @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is an orthonormal system and @xmath113 is a set of strictly positive numbers .",
    "therefore , since @xmath114 is positive , we have : @xmath115 but this is in contrast with the inequality @xmath116 previously found .",
    "@xmath83    from lemma  [ primo ] and lemma  [ secondo ] one obtains immediately the following result :    the inverse of a linear map belonging to the set @xmath102 belongs to this set too .",
    "hence , @xmath102 is a subgroup of @xmath87 .",
    "we now consider the set @xmath117 consisting of those linear maps in @xmath9 of the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 , @xmath120 are linear maps in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , respectively , that are positive , trace - preserving and unitary .",
    "an analogous definition holds for the set @xmath121 , with the ` local maps ' @xmath119 , @xmath120 assumed to be _ completely positive _ rather than simply positive .",
    "it is clear that the sets @xmath117 and @xmath121 are semigroups with identity .",
    "we will see that they are actually groups .",
    "consider also the group of _ local unitary transformations _ @xmath122 which is obviously a subgroup of both @xmath117 and @xmath121 . in a similar way one defines the group of _ local unitary - antiunitary transformations _",
    "@xmath123 ( include local antiunitary operators @xmath124 in the r.h.s .  of  ( [ def - otot ] ) ) .",
    "an example of a map that belongs to @xmath123 , but not to @xmath125 , is the tensor product @xmath96 of two partial transpositions @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "@xmath83    a _ kadison automorphism _ is a bijective map from @xmath127  the convex set of density operators in a hilbert space @xmath128  onto itself that is convex linear .",
    "we now state as a lemma a property of this kind of automorphisms that can be obtained ` by duality ' from a well known result due to kadison  @xcite ( concerning @xmath129-algebras ) :    [ kadison - th ] every kadison automorphism @xmath130 is of the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a unitary or anti - unitary operator .",
    "assume that the hilbert space @xmath128 is finite - dimensional .",
    "then , since any operator @xmath133 can be written as @xmath134 , for some @xmath135 and some non - negative numbers @xmath136 , it is clear that every kadison automorphism @xmath130 extends ( uniquely ) in a natural way to a linear map in @xmath137 ; conversely , a linear map in @xmath137 which is bijective on @xmath127 can be regarded as a kadison automorphism .",
    "let us denote by @xmath138 the group of unitary - antiunitary transformations in @xmath9 .",
    "we are now able to prove the following result :    the group @xmath102 coincides with the group @xmath139 .",
    "the group @xmath117 coincides with the group @xmath123 .",
    "the set @xmath121 is a group which coincides with the group of local unitary transformations @xmath125 .",
    "all the mentioned groups are subgroups of @xmath100 , and @xmath100 is a subgroup of @xmath138 .",
    "* proof : * it is clear that the group @xmath139 is a subgroup of @xmath102 . on the other hand , by lemma  [ primo ] and lemma  [ secondo ] , a map in the group @xmath102 is a kadison automorphism ; hence , by lemma  [ kadison - th ] , it is contained in @xmath139 .",
    "this proves the first assertion of the theorem .",
    "next , given a map @xmath118 in @xmath117  where @xmath119 , @xmath120 are linear maps in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , respectively , that are positive , trace - preserving and unitary  the maps @xmath119 and @xmath120 are kadison automorphisms .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ kadison - th ] , @xmath140 for some unitary or antiunitary operators @xmath124 in @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the group @xmath117 coincides with the group @xmath123 .",
    "note that , since an antiunitary operator is the composition of a unitary operator with a complex conjugation , if in  ( [ unant ] ) we let the operators @xmath124 be antiunitary , we have that the maps @xmath119 , @xmath120 are the composition of unitary transformations with transpositions .",
    "transpositions are positive but not completely positive maps ; hence , the set @xmath121 coincides with the group of local unitary transformations @xmath125 . finally , observe that the maps in the group @xmath100 are kadison automorphisms .",
    "thus , by lemma  [ kadison - th ] , the last assertion of the theorem follows .",
    "@xmath83      in  @xcite , the authors considered the schmidt decomposition of _ pure _ states , and , in that setting , analyzed the geometry of the sets of schmidt equivalent pure states ( that turn out to be differentiable manifolds ) .",
    "since two pure states are schmidt equivalent if and only if they are mutually convertible via local unitary transformations , they called such manifolds ` the manifolds of _ interconvertible _ states ' . the aim of the present section is to apply the same line of reasoning to study the structure of the manifolds of schmidt equivalent ( mixed ) states .",
    "here we assume for simplicity that @xmath142 , hence @xmath143 .",
    "this is not necessary for our purposes but it allows a convenient simplification of our formulae .    as it is discussed below , there is a major limitation to the straightforward extension of the aforementioned results from pure to mixed states .",
    "the definition of sc s is based on the fact that density operators are elements of a vector space . on the other hand , they are constrained to be positive operators ( of unit trace ) because of their physical interpretation .",
    "this leads to the main difference between the results in  @xcite and our forthcoming discussion : while in  @xcite the geometry of the manifolds of interconvertible states can be characterized globally , here we are limited to a ` local ' analysis ( i.e.  we are forced to consider transformations in a neighborhood of the identity ) .",
    "as stated in proposition  [ equivalence ] , the transformations of the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 belongs to @xmath62 , preserve the sc s .",
    "the converse is also true : if two operators have the same sc s then they are connected by a map in the group @xmath62 . therefore , we can build the different equivalence classes acting locally on ` fiducial states ' with the group @xmath62 . actually , we need to consider the component connected to the identity of this group , which is isomorphic to ( and will be identified with ) the lie group @xmath146 .",
    "we need then to impose two conditions on the local ( i.e.  close to the identity ) transformations : _ a ) _ the positivity of a fiducial state @xmath0 must be preserved , and _",
    "b ) _ the trace of @xmath0 has to be preserved as well .",
    "the first is a _ global constraint _ that does not ` reduce the number of dimensions ' , although characterizing a neighborhood of the identity in @xmath146 preserving the positivity of a given fiducial state is a challenging open problem .",
    "the second constraint , normalization , is a _ local constraint _ that reduces the dimension of the manifold by one : the condition that @xmath147 amounts to fixing the projection of the vector @xmath0 along the direction @xmath148 .",
    "let us consider an orthonormal basis in the real hilbert space of the form @xmath149 ; clearly , @xmath150 , because of the orthogonality condition with @xmath151 . given a state @xmath19 , we have : @xmath152 the infinitesimal action of the lie group @xmath146 on the basis elements is of the form @xmath153 where contraction of repeated indices is understood . here",
    "@xmath154 and @xmath155 are real , @xmath156 antisymmetric matrices and @xmath157 and @xmath158 are real @xmath159-dimensional vectors .    hence , by applying an infinitesimal transformation in @xmath146 with generators @xmath160 it is not difficult to see that the coefficient of @xmath161  and hence @xmath162  undergoes the following change : @xmath163 in this equation we have kept the leading non - trivial infinitesimal changes , discarding those of the type @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this is the correct expansion in the space of jets of regular functions of two vectors with nonvanishing gradients .",
    "equation  ( [ equa ] ) defines a surface similar to an hyperboloid . in order to visualize it one",
    "can simply take @xmath166 . for a simple choice of @xmath167 , the result",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig : doev ] .",
    "clearly , connection to the identity implies that only the branch containing the origin has to be considered .",
    "therefore , the vectors @xmath168 are constrained while the matrices @xmath169 are unconstrained . , @xmath170 . in this atypical case",
    "we need to keep terms of @xmath171 in the transformation law of @xmath172 .",
    "once this is done one checks that the codimension is still one .",
    "the really degenerate case @xmath173 , instead , corresponds to the class of equivalence of a single point @xmath174 , with dimension 0 .",
    "this point has to be considered as the ` tip ' , the extremal point of the space of states . ] assuming that _ the sc s are all different _",
    "( i.e.  that @xmath0 is a ` typical state ' ) , one finds out that the schmidt equivalence class @xmath53 is locally diffeomorphic to @xmath175 where the subgroup @xmath176 is generated by the linear combination of the coefficients @xmath177 derived above .",
    "then , the dimension of the manifold @xmath53 is @xmath178 it is easy to see how this counting is consistent with the intuition that changing one of the sc s @xmath179 of @xmath0 brings out of the equivalence class @xmath53 . indeed , subtracting the number of the sc s from the number of dimensions  @xmath180  we obtain the dimensionality of a typical orbit .",
    "for example , take the case of two - qubits : @xmath181 .",
    "we have : @xmath182 and @xmath183 ; hence , the manifold @xmath53 , for a typical bipartite state @xmath19 , is @xmath184-dimensional .    if @xmath19 is a non - typical state , the dimension of the manifold @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , in the case where the @xmath186 sc s of @xmath0 cluster into subsets of @xmath187 identical values  by means of an argument analogous to the one adopted in  @xcite  one can check that there is a ` local stabilizer subgroup ' isomorphic to @xmath188 ; therefore , in this case , @xmath53 is locally diffeomorphic to @xmath189 then , the dimension @xmath190 of @xmath53 is given , in general , by @xmath191    in order to make the above argument _ rigorous _ , one should actually _ prove _ that the schmidt equivalence classes are actually differentiable manifolds . in that case",
    "our previous argument would provide the correct dimension of such manifolds . as we learn from mathematicians  @xcite , a standard tool for characterizing a subset of a differentiable manifold ( like the manifold of hermitian operators in @xmath5 ) as a submanifold is the study of the ( possible ) lie groups acting transitively on the given subset and of the associated stabilizer subgroups .",
    "therefore , suitably improving the analysis of subsection  [ local_maps ] may allow to achieve such a remarkable result .",
    "we will now consider the role played by schmidt coefficients in the characterization of entanglement .",
    "our starting point will be the realignment criterion ( rc ) .",
    "it is natural to wonder if the _",
    "whole set _ of the sc s of a bipartite state may allow a stronger characterization of entanglement with respect to the rc .",
    "as we have seen , the rc , like other separability criteria , is based on the evaluation of a single functional in terms of which a necessary condition for separability can be stated . in the case of the rc , that functional coincides with the sum of the schmidt coefficients . on the other hand the evaluation of a single functional might not be sufficient to determine completely the presence of entanglement @xcite ( from a more general point of view , we may say , to characterize classical and quantum correlations ) .",
    "in particular , as the rc is only a necessary condition for separability , one is led to consider additional functionals in order to gain information about the presence of entanglement .    here",
    "we propose to consider the _",
    "symmetric polynomials _ in the schmidt coefficients , namely : @xmath192 } & = & \\sum_{k=1}^{{\\mathsf{d}}}\\lambda_k \\\\ { { \\mbox{$\\mathrm{m}$}}}^{[2 ] } & = & \\sum_{h\\neq k=1}^{{\\mathsf{d}}}\\lambda_h \\lambda_k \\\\ & \\dots & \\\\ { { \\mbox{$\\mathrm{m}$}}}^{[l ] } & = & \\sum_{\\ { i_1,i_2\\dots i_l \\ } } \\lambda_{i_1 } \\lambda_{i_2 } \\dots \\lambda_{i_l}\\\\ &   \\dots & \\\\ { { \\mbox{$\\mathrm{m}$}}}^{[{{\\mathsf{d } } } ] } & = & \\prod_{k=1}^{{\\mathsf{d}}}\\lambda_k . \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the rc involves the symmetric polynomial of degree one .",
    "a naive argument says that , if the sum of the schmidt coefficients is equal to @xmath193 , their product is upper bounded by @xmath194 .",
    "hence we have the following condition for a separable density matrix @xmath195 : @xmath196 } \\leq \\left ( \\frac{1}{{{\\mathsf{d } } } } \\right)^{{\\mathsf{d}}},\\ ] ] which obviously defines a weaker separability criterion .",
    "analogously , one can consider the symmetric polynomial of degree @xmath197 and obtain the following necessary conditions for separability : @xmath198 } \\leq y_l({{\\mathsf{d } } } ) = { { { \\mathsf{d}}}\\choose l } \\left ( \\frac{1}{{{\\mathsf{d } } } } \\right)^{l}.\\ ] ] in particular , if @xmath0 has schmidt rank @xmath199 , we can write the conditions @xmath200 } \\leq { { { \\mathsf{r}}}\\choose l } \\left ( \\frac{1}{{{\\mathsf{r } } } } \\right)^l\\ ] ] for @xmath201 , while @xmath202}=0 $ ] for @xmath203 .",

    "hence , as separability criteria , they are weaker than the parent one .",
    "section [ new ] will be devoted to the study of possible stronger generalization .",
    "finally , we notice that in the approach followed in @xcite , which makes use of the associated realigned matrix @xmath37 , the symmetric polynomials are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial : @xmath206}(|\\rho^{{\\mbox{\\tiny $ \\mathrm{r}$}}}| ) ( -x)^{{{\\mathsf{d}}}-l}\\ ] ] where , with abuse of notation , we indicated with @xmath202}(a)$ ] the principal minor of order @xmath197 of the matrix @xmath207 .",
    "this section is devoted to the application of the ideas presented in section [ ideas ] to the study of quantum channels , i.e.completely positive trace - preserving ( cpt ) maps . in order to do that",
    ", we exploit the well known correspondence between quantum channels and quantum states ( see @xcite ) .    here",
    "we consider quantum systems with hilbert spaces @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the set of states in the composite system @xmath208 , and the set of cpt maps from system @xmath209 to system @xmath210 , which is denoted @xmath211 .    given a cpt map @xmath212 , one can associate a state @xmath213 in the following _ canonical _ way : @xmath214 where @xmath215 denotes a maximally entangled state , for instance @xmath216 , and @xmath217 is the identical map in the system @xmath209 .    a cpt map @xmath218 is said to be entanglement breaking ( eb ) if @xmath219 maps any state into a separable one @xcite .",
    "one can show that a cpt is eb if and only if the map @xmath219 transforms a maximally entangled state into a separable one .",
    "it follows that the cpt map is eb if and only if the canonically associated state is separable .",
    "one can select a local orthogonal basis @xmath220    it is easy to check that , with the canonical association ( [ can ] ) , the matrix representation of the state @xmath0 and the map @xmath218 are related in the following way : @xmath221    following the definition in @xcite , it is immediate to recognize that , apart of the normalization factor @xmath222 , the matrix expression of @xmath218 is identical to the realigned matrix @xmath37 ( see equation ( [ rea_matrix ] ) ) . identifying the cpt map with the realigned matrix of the corresponding density matrix , one can consider the characteristic polynomial @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 . to fix the ideas ,",
    "let us consider the case in which @xmath226 has full rank .",
    "one obtains from ( [ det ] ) the following necessary condition for @xmath218 to be entanglement breaking : @xmath227    the determinant of quantum channels was also considered in  @xcite , in which some of its properties were presented and discussed in the context of factorization of cpt maps .",
    "the present result relates a geometric property of the map , such as the rate of contraction of volume ( which is equal to @xmath228 ) to the property of being entanglement breaking .",
    "analogously , from ( [ minors ] ) , if the matrix @xmath229 has rank @xmath199 , we can write the following necessary conditions for @xmath218 to be entanglement breaking : @xmath230}\\left(|\\mathcal{e}|\\right ) \\leq { { { \\mathsf{r}}}\\choose l } \\left(\\frac{{{n_{\\mbox{\\tiny $ \\mathsf{b}$}}}}}{{{\\mathsf{r } } } } \\right)^{l}\\ ] ] for @xmath231 .",

    "hence , referring to the singular value decomposition in equation ( [ ref_me ] ) , we can write the schmidt decomposition of the density matrix in the following way : @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are respectively the entries of the unitary matrices @xmath47 and @xmath46 ( see equation ( [ ref_me ] ) ) , with dimension @xmath245 and @xmath246 . we introduce the following notation @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 indicate the vectors respectively defined as the rows and the columns of the matrices @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
