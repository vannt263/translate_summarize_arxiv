    "the main motivation of this theory comes from the fact that every unification of fundamental interaction exhibits effective actions containing higher order terms in the curvature invariants .",
    "this strategy was adopted in the study of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes @xcite as well as in the lagrangian of string and kaluza - klein theories @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite . in this context , it is easy to show that @xmath0 gravity is equivalent to scalar tensor theory as well as to general relativity ( gr ) with an ideal fluid @xcite .    in an isotropic and homogeneous spacetimes ,",
    "the einstein field equations give rise to the friedmann equations which are used to describe the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , the speedy development in observational cosmology shows that the universe has undergone two phases of cosmic acceleration . the first phase is called inflation @xcite-@xcite which is believed to have occurred earlier than matter domination @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this accelerating phase is expected to solve horizon problems involved in the big bang cosmology and to explain nearly flat spectrum of temperature anisotropies observed in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiations @xcite .",
    "the second accelerating phase has occurred after the matter domination .",
    "the first model of inflation with @xmath8 , proposed by starobinsky @xcite , can lead to an accelerated expansion of the universe due to @xmath9 term .",
    "the unknown component giving rise to this late - time acceleration is called dark energy ( de ) @xcite-@xcite .",

    "sharif and his collaborators @xcite have investigated the exact solutions of plane bianchi models for both vacuum and non - vacuum cases .",
    "hollestein and lobo @xcite explored exact solutions of the field equations coupled to non - linear electrodynamics .",
    "it has been observed that some large - angle anomalies appear in cmb radiations which violate the statistical isotropy of the universe @xcite .",
