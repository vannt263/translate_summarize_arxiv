    "particles in cavity fields , in contrast to free - space optical potentials , substantially act back on the field dynamics  @xcite , which generates complex and rich nonlinear dynamics  @xcite . in the standard optomechanical limit of very tightly trapped particles or membranes , which can essentially be modeled by harmonic oscillators  @xcite",
    ", a wealth of interesting physics beyond ground - state cooling appears in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "typical examples are atom - field entanglement , nonlinear oscillations , and multistable behavior  @xcite .",
    "the system dynamics gets even more complex and rich , if one refrains from linearizing the particle motion and considers its full dynamics along the cavity potential  @xcite .    in most cases the optical potential along the cavity axis",
    "is well approximated by a sinusoidal lattice potential with a depth proportional to the momentary intracavity photon number  @xcite .",
    "while for deep potentials the harmonic - oscillator basis allows for analytic insight , it becomes inadequate for shallower lattices .",
    "the eigenfunctions of periodic potentials are delocalized bloch functions , which can be transformed to localized wannier functions  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no analytic solutions for neither the bloch nor the wannier functions are known even for a fixed lattice depth . hence , aiming for an explicit analytic treatment in the ( dynamic ) quantum - potential limit is a hopeless goal . in view of these complications ,",
    "several semiclassical and mean - field models with factorized evolution of the particles and the field have been developed to obtain some first insights  @xcite . here",
    "the field expectation value is governed by ordinary differential equations containing particle expectation values .",
    "this field is in turn inserted in the effective hamiltonian for the particle motion  @xcite . even in this strongly simplified limit",
    "the nonlinearity of the interaction does not allow for a straightforward solution in the general case and further assumptions are needed  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the full quantum dynamics and the steady - state properties for the case of a single particle in a cavity - sustained optical lattice in the strongly coupled and strongly pumped limit .",
    "hence , our treatment will centrally be based on straightforward numerical solutions of the corresponding quantum - optical master equation .",
    "strong emphasis will be put on steady - state properties of the system in the limit of very low temperatures close to @xmath1 , where semiclassical treatments predict a multitude of stationary solutions . to this end",
    "we will heavily rely on quantum monte carlo wave - function simulations  @xcite , since a direct solution of the master equation becomes very slow and cumbersome owing to the large joint particle - field hilbert space , even though we consider the simplest possible system involving only a single particle .",

    "[ sec_model ] we introduce the model hamiltonian and the master equation , from which we derive equations for the expectation values of the cavity field and the photon number , depending on the particle state .",
    "to get some first qualitative insight into the system behavior and to identify interesting parameter regimes , we start with simplified semiclassical models . factorizing atom and field dynamics , we approximate the photon field by a classical field characterized by its mean photon number , which is determined by the spatial distribution of the particle .",
    "we then look for self - consistent steady - state solutions for the expected photon number .",
    "section  [ sec_self - consistent ] is devoted to studies of these self - consistency conditions in various limiting cases .",
    "we first consider the deep - trap limit of harmonic particle confinement , which allows for an analytic treatment .",
    "this analysis is afterwards extended to localized wannier states in the general case of a periodic optical lattice . in sec .",

    ". obviously , the field dynamics depends on the motional state of the particle via the expectation value ( bunching parameter ) @xmath21 in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "this parameter itself is , in turn , governed by the schrdinger equation containing the hamiltonian  , whose spatial eigenstates are bloch functions according to the quantized lattice depth @xmath22 .",
    "this yields a different evolution for each photon - number component of the total wave function and thus a very complex time evolution .",
    "hence , a full solution of the master equation   requires a numerical approach , which can be directly implemented using a truncated photon number and momentum basis expansion .",
    "note that due to the periodic nature of the potential we can work with periodic boundary conditions in real space and use a discrete momentum basis @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "as these calculations are time consuming and the range of physical parameters @xmath25 is large , we first try to get some qualitative insight and find interesting parameters regions using the factorized semiclassical approach involving eqs .  .",
    "let us now analyze potential stationary solutions of the coupled ode system  . as the field dynamics in the semiclassical approximation depends on the position distribution of the particle via the expectation value   only , for the system to reach a steady state we need a stationary wave function .",
    "this leads to the self - consistency condition @xmath26 where the wave function of the particle has to be an eigenstate of eq .   with the photon - number operator @xmath27 replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "note that the expectation value @xmath29 in the denominator on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "does not explicitly involve any field operators .",
    "nevertheless , the time evolution of the spatial part of the wave function depends on the field intensity .",
    "hence , the state can only be stationary if it is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian   for the momentary photon number .",
    "note that the pump amplitude @xmath5 is a free parameter in the above equation and in many cases for a given eigenstate of the particle hamiltonian a self - consistent choice of @xmath5 can be made to fulfill eq .",
    "we , however , opt for the opposite approach and determine self - consistent photon numbers for given pump strengths .",
    "let us mention , though , that this is only a necessary condition and by no means sufficient for a stable stationary equilibrium subject to the quantum fluctuations of the system .",
    "at this point it can only serve as a guide towards interesting parameter regions , which is , e.g. , the case when several different spatial eigenfunctions lead to the same pump amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "we will discuss this in some more detail below for specific limiting examples .      in the limit where the potential depth @xmath30 strongly exceeds the recoil energy @xmath31 , the lowest - energy particle states are well localized within a single well of the optical lattice . for low enough temperatures the optical potential @xmath32",

    "several interesting aspects of the deep - trap harmonic - oscillator regime have been studied in the past  @xcite . in many respects the system",
    "is directly related to standard optomechanical models with quadratic coupling  @xcite .",
    "for ultracold particles and weaker optical potentials the motion is strongly delocalized in the lattice  @xcite .",
    "hence , we now turn to the full model and consider the particle s motion in the periodic optical lattice @xmath48    for very shallow lattices close to zero temperature , i.e. , for a bec in a cavity , a two - mode expansion of the wave function can be applied  @xcite , which again allows for analytic treatments and analogies with optomechanical couplings . however , the validity range of this model is limited in temperature , time , and coupling strength .",
    "as we are here more interested in the limit of strong nonlinear backaction in deep potentials , we can not apply this simplification and have to solve the schrdinger equation for a periodic potential , which gives us the well - known bloch states @xmath49 , where @xmath3 denotes the energy band and @xmath50 is the quasi - momentum  @xcite .",
    "being periodic with the lattice constant , they are not the best basis to describe a single localized particle .",
    "hence , we switch to a wannier basis , where each basis state represents a localized wave function with its center of mass at a particular lattice site .",

    "therefore @xmath42 does not explicitly appear on the right - hand side of eq .  , but enters implicitly through the shape of the wave function . as",
    "before , we can obtain the contours where eq",

    "higher bands exhibit up to three solutions of eq .   for a given value of @xmath6 .",
    "parameters : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]",
    "the behaviors of the photon numbers for the lowest - energy states @xmath59 and @xmath60 in both cases are very much alike , because the corresponding lowest bound states in both models are similar . indeed",
    ", the maximally localized wannier functions converge to the harmonic oscillator functions for deep potentials  @xcite . for the higher - energy eigenstates , however ,",
    "the photon numbers differ significantly .",
    "the reason behind is that in a harmonic oscillator all states are bound , while wannier states for increasing @xmath61 undergo a transition from bound to free states for a given photon number ( i.e. , potential depth ) .",
    "dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_selconswa ] indicate this boundary . for @xmath61 sharp bends",
    "appear , yielding self - consistent contours reminiscent of nonlinear response curves .",
    "the origin of these peculiarity at the transition from free to bound states becomes evident , if we look at the spatial particle density of the respective wannier states .",
    "figure  [ fig_wannloc ] illustrates the behavior of the fourth band wannier state @xmath62 for different mean photon numbers ( i.e. , potential depths ) .",
    "the key quantity here is the expectation value of the bunching parameter @xmath63 [ eq .  ] , which determines the backaction of the particle on the cavity field , i.e. , its effective refractive index .",
    "for free particles , @xmath64 , the wave function is barely localized and @xmath65 .",
    "around @xmath66 the wannier states localize around potential maxima , i.e. , optical field nodes , which minimizes the backaction of the particle on the cavity , @xmath67 , while for deeper potentials @xmath68 and particles are drawn towards field antinodes and the index of refraction increases with potential depth , @xmath69 .",
    "thus the nonlinear behavior of the refractive index allows for multiple self - consistent solutions for certain ranges of the cavity detuning @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we also find solutions corresponding to unbound particle states ( e.g. , for @xmath62 in fig .",

    "( c ) tight - binding regime : the wave function is strongly localized in a single potential well , @xmath71 . ]      as we saw above , for certain parameter ranges in both the harmonic oscillator and the wannier contour plots more than one self - consistent solution appears .",
    "whether or not these solutions have significant relevance for the full system dynamics depends on their stability properties , i.e. , their response against small deviations in the photon number or the spatial distribution .",
    "some qualitative insight can already be gained by virtue of eq .  .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "depends on the shape of the wave function in real space , which in our semiclassical model implicitly depends on @xmath42 .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of eq .   determines the mean photon number that is allowed by the spatial part of the wave function in steady state .",
    "if it increases or decreases with @xmath42 faster than @xmath42 at a self - consistent point , one may assume that the self - consistent configuration is unstable .",
    "therefore we find that at _ stable _ self - consistent configurations the inequality @xmath72 must hold .",
    "this rather intuitive result is verified in appendix  [ app_stability ] via linear stability analysis .",
    "the stability regions for the fourth band ( where up to three self - consistent solutions exist ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_selcons3d ] .    , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "in order to test the above analysis , we now strive to solve the full master equation [ eq .  ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the ( even for a single particle ) large hilbert space makes a direct numerical integration attempt practically unfeasible for realistic parameters and photon numbers .",
    "we therefore make use of quantum monte carlo wave - function simulations , in which single stochastic state vectors ( instead of the whole density matrix ) are evolved subject to a non - hermitian effective hamilton operator  @xcite .",
    "this evolution is stochastically interrupted by quantum jumps corresponding to a projective removal of one photon .",
    "mathematically , averaging over a large number of such trajectories then approximates the full density matrix .",
    "interestingly , the jumps can be physically interpreted as detection events of photons leaking out of the resonator .",
    "hence , single trajectories provide a microscopic view of the processes incorporated in the master equation since the ensemble average over many trajectories converges towards the solution of the latter .    in what follows",
    "we compare our above predictions with the time evolution of single trajectories as well as to their ensemble average .",
    "the numerical implementation of these simulations was done within the c++qed framework allowing efficient and fast simulations  @xcite . since",
    "dynamic aspects have been eliminated in our self - consistency and stability analysis , it is not clear which of the self - consistent solutions appear in the dynamics and what are their corresponding probabilities .",
    "we consider a small sample of single quantum trajectories in a multistable regime .",
    "figure  [ fig_singtraj ] shows the corresponding expectation values of the intracavity photon number @xmath42 as well as of the kinetic energy @xmath73 .",
    "as one might expect , both quantities jump simultaneously between rather stable values .",
    "the latter can be identified as the possible semiclassical values found above .",
    "each trajectory thus seems to switch between these states rather than forming state superpositions . between jumps both quantities",
    "appear to fluctuate only weakly about the self - consistent values ( upper three graphs ) . in some cases @xmath42 jumps to very low values , where no bound state exists . in such cases",
    "the system continuously heats up ( i.e. , @xmath74 increases ) until a subsequent jump occurs and projects the particle back into a bound state ( as for example in fig .",
    "[ fig_singtraj]b between the two quantum jumps at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; the significantly increased photon number after the second jump allows again for bound states ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_singtraj]d shows an extreme case , where the particle remains essentially free for a long time .",
    "we find that there exists a multitude of stable self - consistent solutions of eq .   around @xmath77 for higher bands ( @xmath78 ) , whose self - consistent photon numbers increase only slightly with increasing band index . a small plateau of @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig_singtraj]d can be interpreted as an occupation of the 12th wannier state , @xmath79 .",
    "we also indicate the mean kinetic energy of the 14th excited band , @xmath80 , and observe that this energy is reached continuously rather than by discrete jumps as in the bound case . below we will re - encounter reminiscences of such trajectories in the ensemble - averaged solution of the master equation .",
    "due to the self - consistent photon numbers small sensitivity on the band index for @xmath78 , according to our semiclassical analysis several excited bands can co - exist at a given value of @xmath42 .",
    "wannier functions for a given potential depth are mutually orthogonal , therefore transitions between bands can only occur through fluctuations in the unbound regime , yielding much slower transition rates than in the bound regime .",
    "trajectories may jump back to bound states , figure  [ fig_singtraj]a  c , or remain unbound , figure  [ fig_singtraj]d .",
    "the likeliness of jumping back to a bound state seems to decrease with kinetic energy . at this stage",
    "it appears that the momentum part of the wave function controls the expected intracavity photon number rather than vice versa .",
    "the correlated particle - field jumps reflect strong particle - field correlations and some amount of entanglement , as previously discussed in similar contexts  @xcite .    , @xmath81 , @xmath46 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the mean values jump between the stable values predicted by the self - consistency equation   ( dashed lines ) .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) trajectories with several jumps from very high to very low photon numbers .",
    "( c ) trajectory with only a few jumps .",
    "( d ) trajectory with a large increase of @xmath74 during evolution in a low - photon - number state .",
    "the kinetic energy mean value of the 12th and 14th excited bands are shown as black solid lines .",
    "although numerical values indicate that the trajectory could be in a definite band , the neat picture of correlated photon number and momentum jumps clearly breaks down at this point .",
    "note the different scaling of the @xmath74 axis . ]",
    "we now investigate the solution of the master equation   of the joint particle - field density matrix by averaging over a sufficiently large ensemble of monte carlo trajectories .",
    "first we check the distribution of photon numbers for a specific choice of parameters and compare it to the semiclassical results . in fig .",
    "[ fig_selconsnbar ] we depict the simplest case of parameters , where only a single semiclassical solution exists .",
    "interestingly , we see that the mean photon numbers obtained from the monte carlo simulations agree surprisingly well with the self - consistent solutions of eq .   for the lowest wannier state ,",
    "as long as the cooling regime ( large negative effective detuning ) is maintained .",
    "closer to resonance we see a deviation towards higher photon numbers , which indicates the appearance of motional exited states ( cf .",
    "[ fig_selconswa ] ) .    ) compared to ensemble - averaged quantum simulation results .",
    "solid lines mark self - consistent contours ; data points are quantum simulation results .",
    "the black line separates the regions where @xmath83 ( left ) and @xmath84 ( right ) along the self - consistent contours of the zeroth band ; cf .",
    "eq .  . in the left region",
    "quantum simulations are in accordance with the self - consistent solutions of eq .   for the lowest band , while deviations arise in the right region due to population of the @xmath85 wannier state .",
    "parameters : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]    motivated by the single trajectories depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_singtraj ] one can deduce a microscopic interpretation of the dynamics .",
    "to each band may be assigned a kinetic temperature @xmath86 , which increases with the band index  .",
    "the sign of the effective detuning @xmath87 determines whether the according band is heated ( @xmath88 ) or cooled ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "heating means that in a certain band the system tends towards populating higher excited bands , while cooling implies the opposite .",
    "since the value of @xmath90 is different for every band , some bands ( the lower ones ) are heated and others ( the higher ones ) are cooled . from the proportionality of the cooling / heating rates to @xmath90 , we conclude that higher bands appear in the ensemble - averaged steady - state solution if @xmath91 note that for symmetry reasons the dynamics induced by the hamiltonian   conserves the parity of the initial state . for a particle initially in the ground state , the lowest accessible excited state is the second band and consequently @xmath92 appears in eq .  .",
    "hence the system effectively remains in the lowest band until @xmath84 ; see figs .",
    "[ fig_selconsnbar ] and  [ fig_rhoraywann6 ] .",
    "this implies that , though the system is effectively blue detuned , it does not get heated ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_cpppvar ] . for certain parameter values",
    "a further increase of @xmath6 around @xmath93 even yields further cooling before the second excited band is populated .    , starting from a state with zero momentum and one cavity photon , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , for @xmath46 , @xmath82 , @xmath96 , and different values of the detuning .",
    "the density matrix is approximated via quantum simulations with ensemble averages over 1000 trajectories for each parameter set .",
