    "the study of phase transitions in combinatorial structures , such as random graphs @xcite is a subject at the intersection of statistical physics , theoretical computer science , and discrete mathematics @xcite . the key idea behind",
    "this study is that large combinatorial structures can be thought of as systems consisting of many locally interacting components , in direct analogy to the kinds of systems within the purview of statistical mechanics . a phase transition ,",
    "then , is a phenomenon that takes place in certain kinds of such systems in the limit of an infinite number of components , and corresponds qualitatively to a change in some global ( macroscopic ) parameter of the system as the local parameters of the components are varied .",
    "boolean networks with gates subject to probabilistic failures fall naturally into the category of systems just described .",
    "the possibility of a phase transition arises here , for instance , when one associates a probability of failure with each gate of such a network , and then looks at the maximum of the probability that the network deviates ( outputs an incorrect result ) , taken over all possible assignments of inputs to the network , in the limit of an infinite number of gates .",
    "the theory of boolean networks with unreliable gates can be traced back to the seminal work of von neumann @xcite , who considered the simplest case , namely when each gate in the network fails with fixed probability @xmath0 independently of all other gates  we will refer to this set - up as the _ @xmath0-independent failure model_. von neumann s initial work was developed further by dobrushin and ortyukov @xcite , pippenger @xcite , feder @xcite , pippenger , stamoulis , and tsitsiklis @xcite , and gcs and gl @xcite , to name just a few .",
    "( it should be mentioned that in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors pointed out several technical flaws of @xcite and presented their own proof of a weaker result ; gcs and gl @xcite later developed methods to recover the full result claimed in @xcite . )",
    "now we will summarize relevant notions and ideas in a more or less narrative fashion ; the requisite details will be supplied in section  [ sec : prelims ] .",
    "one of the key results obtained by von neumann @xcite was the following : if the probability @xmath0 of gate failure is sufficiently small , then any boolean function can be computed by a network of unreliable gates such that the probability of error is bounded by a constant independent of the function being computed . on the other hand , since in this model",
    "a boolean network is no more reliable than its last gate , the probability of error can get arbitrarily close to one if the probability of gate failure is sufficiently large .",
    "( this is , in fact , one possibility for a phase transition in boolean networks with unreliable gates , which we have alluded to in the preceding paragraph . )",
    "however , as pointed out by pippenger @xcite , the model of independent stochastic failures has the following significant drawback .",
    "suppose that , within this model , a network is shown to compute a boolean function @xmath10 with probability of error at most @xmath11 , when the gate failure probability is equal to @xmath0 . then it can not be guaranteed in general that the same network will compute @xmath10 with probability of error at most @xmath11 when the gate failure probability is smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , such a network may not even compute @xmath10 at all in the absence of failures !",
    "this is due to the fact that gates which fail with a fixed and known probability can be assembled into random - number generators that would output independent and nearly unbiased random bits .",
    "these random - number generators can , in turn , be used to implement a randomized algorithm that would correctly compute @xmath10 with high probability . however",
    ", if one were to replace the outputs of the random - number generators with some fixed constants , then that algorithm would be very likely to produce meaningless results .",
    "another observation made by pippenger was the following . in complexity theory of boolean circuits",
    "@xcite , a theorem due to muller @xcite says that , given any two finite , complete bases @xmath13 and @xmath14 of boolean functions , a network over @xmath13 that computes a function @xmath10 can be realized as a network over @xmath14 with size and depth differing from those of the original circuit by multiplicative constants that depend only on @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is not immediately clear under what conditions such an invariance theorem would hold for networks with unreliable gates .",
    "in order to overcome these objections , pippenger proposed in @xcite a more general model of boolean networks with unreliable gates .",
    "gate failures under this model are no longer independent , but instead are such that the conditional probability of any gate failing , given the status ( failed or not ) of any set of gates preceding it , is at most @xmath0 . in pippenger s",
    "terminology @xcite , this model is called _ @xmath0-admissible_.",
    "it is immediately evident that the @xmath0-admissible model subsumes the @xmath0-independent one .",
    "it also follows from definitions that a network that computes a function @xmath10 reliably for all probability distributions of gate failures within the @xmath0-admissible model , will continue to do so under the @xmath12-admissible model for any @xmath15 .",
    "another key achievement of pippenger s paper @xcite is the proof of a muller - type invariance theorem for boolean networks with unreliable gates , in which the @xmath0-admissible model plays an essential role .",
    "the contribution of the present paper consists mainly in showing that pippenger s",
    "@xmath0-admissible model , applied to boolean networks drawn at random according to a certain model of random directed acyclic graphs , exhibits a phase transition in terms of the minimum probability of the failure - free configuration as the network s wiring pattern evolves from `` sparse '' to `` dense . ''",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : prelims ] we fix definitions and notation used throughout the paper and collect some preliminaries on graphs , boolean networks , and the formalism used in pippenger s paper @xcite .",
    "our main result  one concerning the phase transition  is proved in section  [ sec : phasetrans ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : stochdom ] , we use the machinery of stochastic domination to carry out a systematic analysis of the more delicate features of pippenger s model .",
    "we close with some remarks in section  [ sec : close ] concerning directions for future research .",
    "finally , in the appendix we prove a certain theorem which , though somewhat tangential to the matter at hand , is closely related to some mathematical techniques and concepts used in this paper .",
    "in this paper we deal exclusively with directed acyclic graphs ( or acyclic digraphs ) .",
    "given such a graph @xmath16 , we will follow standard practice of denoting by @xmath17 the number of vertices of @xmath18 and by @xmath19 the number of edges .",
    "any acyclic digraph has at least one vertex of in - degree zero .",
    "we will denote by @xmath20 the graph obtained from @xmath18 by deleting all such vertices along with all of their outgoing edges .",
    "let us define the _ out - neighborhood _ of a vertex @xmath21 as the set @xmath22 , and the _ closed out - neighborhood _ as @xmath23 .",
    "if vertex @xmath24 can be reached from vertex @xmath25 by a directed path , we will write @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 whenever we need to specify @xmath18 explicitly ) . the _ transitive closure _ of a graph @xmath18 is the graph @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the transitive closure of a vertex @xmath25 is the set @xmath31 ; the set @xmath32 is called the _ reflexive , transitive closure _ ( rtc , for short ) of @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath33 is simply the ( closed ) out - neighborhood of the vertex @xmath25 in @xmath34 .",
    "it is also convenient to partially order the vertices of @xmath18 as follows : for @xmath35 distinct , we will write @xmath36 if @xmath26 , and require that @xmath37 for each @xmath25 . in this way , @xmath38 is simply the reflexive closure of the asymmetric transitive relation @xmath39 .",
    "an important role in this paper will be played by the random acyclic digraph introduced by barak and @xcite .",
    "it is obtained from the standard undirected random graph @xmath40 @xcite by orienting the edges according to the natural ordering of the vertex set @xmath41 $ ] , and will henceforth be denoted by @xmath42 .",
    "a _ boolean function _ is any function @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "a set of boolean functions is referred to as a _",
    "basis_. in particular , we say that a basis @xmath13 is _ complete _ if any boolean function can be realized by composing elements of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a finite complete basis .",
    "a _ boolean network _ ( or _ circuit _ ) @xmath45 _ over @xmath13 _ is an acyclic digraph @xmath18 with a specially designated vertex of out - degree zero ( the _ output _ of @xmath45 ) , such that each vertex of @xmath46 is labelled by some boolean function @xmath47 of its immediate predecessors , and each vertex in @xmath48 is labelled either by a boolean variable ( these vertices are the _ inputs _ of @xmath45 ) or by a constant 0 or 1 .",
    "whenever there is a need to specify the network @xmath45 explicitly , we will write , e.g. , @xmath49 , etc . we will refer to the graph @xmath50 as the _ gate interconnection graph _ of @xmath51 .",
    "given a network @xmath45 with @xmath52 input vertices , we will assume the latter to be ordered in some way , and therefore @xmath53 , @xmath54 , will denote the boolean variable associated with the @xmath25th input vertex . for any assignment @xmath55 of values to the inputs of the network ,",
    "the value of each vertex can be computed recursively in the obvious way , namely by evaluating the boolean function labelling it on the values of its immediate predecessors .",
    "we then say that the network _ computes _ a boolean function @xmath43 if , for any @xmath55 , the value of the output vertex , which we will denote by @xmath56 , is equal to @xmath57 .",
    "let us associate with a network @xmath45 the measurable space @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the set of all subsets of @xmath61 .",
    "then the occurrence of failures in the gates of @xmath45 is described by a probability measure @xmath62 on @xmath63 or , equivalently , by a family @xmath64 of @xmath65-valued random variables , where @xmath66 is the indicator function of the event @xmath67 and the equivalence is , of course , given by @xmath68 from now on , given a probability measure @xmath62 , we will denote probabilities of various events by @xmath69 or by @xmath70 , or sometimes by just @xmath71 , whenever the omission of the underlying measure is not likely to cause ambiguity .    following pippenger @xcite , we define a _ probabilistic failure model _ ( or pfm , for short ) as a map @xmath72 that assigns to every boolean network @xmath73 a compact subset @xmath74 of the set @xmath75 of all probability measures on @xmath58 .",
    "one typically works with a family \\{@xmath76 of pfm s , where @xmath0 can be thought of as a local parameter describing the behavior of individual gates ; to give a simple example , the @xmath0-independent pfm is the map @xmath77 that assigns to each network @xmath45 the product measure @xmath78 , where each @xmath79 is a copy of the bernoulli measure @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "given such a family @xmath82 , a network @xmath45 with @xmath52 inputs and a boolean function @xmath83 , we say that @xmath45 @xmath84- _ computes @xmath10 with respect to @xmath85 _ if @xmath86 the maximum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : perror ] ) exists owing to the finiteness of @xmath87 and to the compactness of @xmath88 . whenever the family @xmath85 contains only one pfm @xmath72",
    ", we will assume that the underlying parameter @xmath0 is known and fixed , and say that @xmath45 @xmath84-computes @xmath10 with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "consider a pair of pfm s , @xmath72 and @xmath89 . in the terminology of pippenger @xcite",
    ", @xmath72 is _ more stringent _ than @xmath89 if , for any network @xmath45 , @xmath90 .",
    "we will also say that @xmath89 is less stringent than @xmath72 .",
    "thus , if one is able to show that a network @xmath45 @xmath84-computes a function @xmath10 with respect to a pfm @xmath72 , then the same network will also @xmath84-compute @xmath10 with respect to any pfm @xmath89 less stringent than @xmath72 .",
    "we would also like to comment on an interesting `` adversarial '' aspect of the pfm formalism ( see also ref .",
    "let us fix a family @xmath91 of pfm s .",
    "we can then envision the following game played by two players , the programmer and the hacker , with the aid of a disinterested third party , the referee .",
    "the referee picks a constant @xmath92 and announces it to the players .",
    "the programmer picks a boolean function @xmath10 and designs a network @xmath45 that would compute @xmath10 in the absence of failures .",
    "he then presents @xmath45 to the hacker and lets him choose ( a ) the input to @xmath45 and ( b ) the locations of gate failures according to @xmath93 .",
    "we assume here that the hacker possesses full knowledge of the structure of @xmath45 . the hacker s objective is to force the network to @xmath94-compute @xmath10 with @xmath95 , and the programmer s objective is to design @xmath45 in such a way that it @xmath96-computes @xmath10 with @xmath97 , regardless of what the hacker may do .",
    "now we state the precise definition of the @xmath0-admissible pfm of pippenger @xcite , alluded to in the introduction . given a network @xmath45 ,",
    "let @xmath98 be the set of all probability measures @xmath99 that satisfy the following condition : for any gate @xmath100 and for any two disjoint sets @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 we have @xmath103 according to definitions set forth in section  [ ssec : boole ] , we will have a pfm @xmath104 if we prove that @xmath105 is a compact set .",
    "this is accomplished in the lemma below ( incidentally , this issue has not been addressed in pippenger s",
    "paper @xcite ) .",
    "[ lm : admcompact ] the set @xmath105 is compact in the metric topology induced by the total variation distance @xcite @xmath106    the topology induced by the total variation distance is actually a norm topology , where the total variation norm is defined on the set @xmath107 of all _ signed _ measures on @xmath63 by @xmath108 furthermore , @xmath75 , obviously being closed and bounded with respect to the total variation norm , is a compact subset of @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath75 is compact ( see remark above ) , it suffices to show that @xmath105 is closed .",
    "suppose that a sequence @xmath110 in @xmath105 converges to @xmath62 in total variation distance .",
    "let us adopt the following shorthand notation : for any two disjoint sets @xmath111 , let @xmath112 fix a gate @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath101 be disjoint sets such that @xmath113 .",
    "then we can find a subsequence @xmath114 , such that each @xmath115 is nonzero as well . by @xmath0-admissibility",
    ", we have the following estimate : @xmath116 we can further estimate the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : compstep1 ] ) : @xmath117 combining ( [ eq : compstep1 ] ) and ( [ eq : compstep2 ] ) and taking the limit along @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 . thus @xmath105 is closed , hence compact .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , pippenger @xcite has termed the pfm @xmath120 _ @xmath0-admissible_. we will also abuse language slightly by referring to individual probability measures @xmath121 as @xmath0-admissible .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath105 containts all bernoulli product measures @xmath122 with @xmath123 , as well as all product measures @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore , it follows directly from definitions that @xmath126 for @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the @xmath0-admissible pfm is more stringent than the @xmath12-admissible one . therefore , when @xmath127 $ ] , a network that @xmath84-computes a function @xmath10 under the @xmath0-admissible model will also @xmath128-compute the same function under the @xmath12-admissible model and , in particular , when the gate failures are distributed according to @xmath122 .",
    "our main result , to be stated and proved in the next section , is formulated in terms of the probability of the failure - free configuration in a network of unreliable gates , under the @xmath0-admissible model of pippenger . as we shall demonstrate shortly , this quantity does not depend on the particular function being computed , but only on the size and the structure of the gate interconnection graph associated to the network .",
    "given a boolean network @xmath45 , let us consider the quantity @xmath129 the set @xmath105 is compact by lemma  [ lm : admcompact ] , and the expression being minimized is a continuous function of @xmath62 with respect to total variation distance .",
    "thus , the infimum in ( [ eq : ff ] ) is actually attained , and a moment of thought reveals that this quantity depends only on the structure of the gate interconnection graph of @xmath45 , but not on the specific gate labels or on the identity of the output vertex .",
    "therefore , given an acyclic digraph @xmath16 , let us define @xmath130 as the quantity ( [ eq : ff ] ) for all networks @xmath45 whose gate interconnection graphs are isomorphic to @xmath18 , modulo gate labels and the identity of the output vertex",
    ". in the same spirit , let us denote by @xmath131 the set of all @xmath0-admissible probability measures on the measurable space @xmath132 where , as before , @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the set of all subsets of @xmath135 .",
    "then we can write @xmath136 our motivation to focus on @xmath130 is twofold : firstly , we are able to gloss over such details as the function being computed or the basis of boolean functions used to construct a given network , and secondly , @xmath130 can also be used to obtain lower bounds on probabilities of other events one would associate with `` proper '' operation of the network ( such as , e.g. , the probability that the majority of gates have not failed @xcite ) .    in order to get a quick idea of the dependence of @xmath130 on the structure of @xmath18 , we can appeal to the  local lemma @xcite or , rather , to a variant thereof due to  and spencer @xcite .",
    "( see also alon and spencer @xcite and bollobs @xcite for proofs and a sampling of applications . )",
    "the basic idea behind the local lemma is this : we have a finite family @xmath137 of `` bad '' events in a common probability space , and we are interested in the probability that none of these events occur , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "the `` original '' local lemma @xcite gives a sufficient condition for this probability to be strictly positive when most of the events @xmath139 are independent , but with strong dependence allowed between some of the subsets of @xmath140 ; for this reason it is formulated in terms of the dependency digraph @xcite for @xmath141 .",
    "the version due to and spencer @xcite ( often referred to as `` lopsided local lemma '' ) has the same content , but under the weaker condition that certain conditional probabilities involving the @xmath139 and their complements are suitably bounded . more precisely :    [ thm:4l ] let @xmath142 be a family of events in a common probability space .",
    "suppose that there exist a directed graph @xmath16 with @xmath143 and real constants @xmath144 , @xmath145 , such that , for any @xmath146 , @xmath147 then @xmath148 in other words , the event `` none of the events @xmath139 occur '' holds with strictly positive probability .",
    "consider now an acyclic digraph @xmath16 .",
    "then , by defintion of @xmath0-admissibility , every probability measure @xmath149 satisfies @xmath150 we can rewrite ( [ eq : pipcond ] ) in terms of the transitive closure graph @xmath34 as follows . denote the out - neighborhood of a vertex @xmath25 in @xmath34 by @xmath151 , and similarly for the closed out - neighborhood .",
    "then ( [ eq : pipcond ] ) becomes @xmath152 now let @xmath153 be the maximum out - degree of @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath154 .",
    "then , provided that @xmath155 , the events @xmath156 will satisfy the condition ( [ eq:4l1 ] ) of theorem  [ thm:4l ] with @xmath157 for all @xmath25 , for every @xmath158 . using ( [ eq:4l2 ] ) , we conclude that @xmath159 furthermore , @xmath160 for @xmath161 because then we have @xmath162 .",
    "thus , defining @xmath163 , we can write @xmath164 in fact , lemma  [ lm : f_exact ] in the next section can be used to obtain the exact expression @xmath165 i.e. , @xmath166 is equal precisely to the probability of @xmath167 when the @xmath168 are independent and @xmath169 .",
    "an inspection of the form of ( [ eq : fgexact ] ) suggests the following strategy for exhibiting a phase transition : we will consider a suitable parametrization @xmath170 of the ( average ) density is defined as @xmath171 .",
    "thus , we have for the expected density of the random graph @xmath40 @xmath172 the expected density of the random acyclic digraph @xmath42 is the same . ] of the random graph @xmath173 , with @xmath174 as @xmath175 , such that the graph is `` sparse '' for @xmath176 and `` dense '' for @xmath177 .",
    "furthermore , this change from `` sparse '' to `` dense '' will be accompanied by a phase transition manifesting itself in the distinct large-@xmath1 behavior of the size @xmath178 of the largest rtc of a vertex in @xmath173 depending on whether @xmath179 , @xmath3 , or @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "( this phase transition was discovered and studied by pittel and tungol @xcite , and will play a key role in our proof . )",
    "given a particular realization of @xmath173 , @xmath180 .",
    "defining random variables @xmath181",
    "[ we have defined @xmath182 in order to avoid cluttered equations ] , we will end up with a sequence of @xmath183-admissible pfm s , such that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath184 will be different depending on whether @xmath185 is above or below unity .",
    "of course , the class of probability measures satisfying the condition ( [ eq : pipcond ] ) is much broader than @xmath131 . in terms of boolean networks",
    ", it describes the probabilistic failure model under which the conditional probability for a particular gate to fail , given that ( any subset of ) the gates preceding it have _ not _ failed , is at most @xmath0 .",
    "( one can use the strategy of lemma  [ lm : admcompact ] to prove that the corresponding set of probability measures is compact . ) in order to get a better grip on the @xmath0-admissible model , one has to make full use of its definition ; this will be done in section  [ sec : stochdom ] using the machinery of stochastic domination @xcite .",
    "as far as the results in the next section are concerned , though , the condition ( [ eq : pipcond ] ) is all that is needed .",
    ", @xmath158 , we would not have been able to spot the role of the rtc in our development .",
    "] incidentally , it is possible to prove a more specialized version of the lopsided  local lemma which , among other things , gives a sufficient condition to have @xmath186 when the conditional probabilities @xmath187 for all disjoint @xmath188 are suitably bounded . since this result is , strictly speaking , tangential to the matter of this paper , we return to it in the appendix .",
    "now we are in a position to state and prove the main result of this paper ( the notation we use has been defined in the preceding section ) :    [ thm : main ] consider all boolean networks with @xmath1 gates whose gate interconnection graphs are drawn from the random acyclic digraph @xmath189 .",

    "we first need to gather some preliminary results .",

    "next , we will need a result on the size of the largest reflexive , transitive closure of a vertex in the random acyclic digraph @xmath214 .",

    "next , we need asymptotics of the function @xmath202 for large @xmath205 . to that end , we write @xmath223 in other words , @xmath224 as @xmath225 .",
    "finally , we will have use for the following two limits :    [ lm : limits ] @xmath226    we will prove ( [ eq : limit1 ] ) ; the same strategy will work for ( [ eq : limit2 ] ) as well .",
    "let us assume that @xmath227 denotes natural logarithms [ otherwise we can multiply the second term in parentheses of ( [ eq : limit1 ] ) by a suitable constant ] .",
    "it suffices to show that @xmath228 using the inequality @xmath229 , we have for each @xmath1 @xmath230 given any @xmath231 , one can find large enough @xmath232 such that the right - hand side of ( [ eq : limit_estimate ] ) is less than @xmath233 for all @xmath234 .",

    "it is easy to see , for instance , that most of the `` really interesting '' events one would naturally associate with proper operation of the network ( e.g. , the event that the majority of the gates have not failed ) are decreasing events .",
    "that is , if such an event occurs in a particular configuration @xmath313 , then this event can be destroyed by introducing additional failed gates .",
    "the event that no gate fails is a particularly drastic example : it is destroyed if we change the status of even a single gate .",
    "equivalently , we may pass to the corresponding probability measure @xmath296 . in that case , given a configuration @xmath314 , the gate failures will correspond to _ zero _ bits of @xmath313 , with the nonzero bits indicating the gates that have not failed .",
    "therefore we may consider _ increasing _ events if we agree to work with @xmath296 instead of @xmath62 . using the stochastic domination properties of @xmath296 , we get that @xmath315 for any increasing event @xmath316 .    as a simple example , consider the following set - up .",

    "we also mention another pfm discussed by pippenger in ref .  @xcite  namely , the so - called @xmath0-_majorized _ model . under this model ,",
    "a network @xmath45 is mapped to the set of all probability measures @xmath62 on @xmath334 that are stochastically dominated by the bernoulli product measure @xmath335 .",

    ", we can mention the work of dobrushin and ortyukov @xcite , where a result proven for the @xmath0-majorized model automatically carries over to the @xmath0-independent one .",
    "in this paper we have showed that a phase transition is possible in the @xmath0-admissible pfm of pippenger @xcite as soon as random graphs show up in the picture . in doing so",
    ", we have barely scratched the surface of a wonderfully rich subject  namely , the statistical mechanics of multicomponent random systems on directed graphs .",
    "most of the work connected to phase transitions in large combinatorial structures has been done in the context of undirected graphs , since the methods of statistical mechanics applicable to the study of combinatorial structures have been originally developed in that context as well .",
    "for instance , the independent - set polynomial of a simple undirected graph @xcite can also be viewed as a partition function of a repulsive lattice gas @xcite , and the powerful machinery of cluster expansions @xcite developed in the latter setting can also be applied quite successfully to the former ; the reader is encouraged to consult a recent paper by scott and sokal @xcite for an exposition of these matters from the viewpoint of both statistical mechanics and graph theory . in the future we would like to study applications of statistical mechanics to combinatorial structures with directionality .",
    "so far , very few results along these lines have appeared ; the papers of whittle @xcite are among the few examples known to the present author where a partition function is constructed for a class of statistical - mechanical models on directed graphs .",
    "the relative dearth of applications of statistical mechanics to structures with directionality is due to the fact that , once directionality is introduced , the symmetry needed for the lattice - gas formalism is destroyed , and it is not immediately evident how one could relate combinatorial properties of directed graphs to mathematical objects of statistical mechanics .",
    "( incidentally , this very point has also been brought up by scott and sokal @xcite . )",
    "our goal in this appendix is to prove a theorem that can be thought of as a specialization of the lopsided  local lemma of  and spencer @xcite ( see also theorem  [ thm:4l ] ) to families of random variables whose joint laws are elements of @xmath285 . both the theorem and its proof go very much along the lines a similar result of liggett , schonmann , and stacey @xcite , except that theirs was formulated for undirected graphs .",
