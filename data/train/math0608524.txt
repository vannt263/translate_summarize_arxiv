    "as we known from the xviii century , @xmath1-partitions  ( as we call them nowadays ) of finite line segments are only possible if the successive adjacent parts of the @xmath1-partition  are of a decreasing length .",
    "this inevitable restriction induces a huge asymmetry in the very partition .",
    "in fact , whatever be the length of the @xmath1-partitioned  line segment and whatever be the @xmath1-partition , all its parts , except a finite number of them , will necessarily lie within an arbitrarily small final segment .",
    "for the sake of illustration , consider an @xmath1-partition  of a @xmath2 light years length segment -the assumed diameter of the universe .",
    "whatever be the @xmath1-partition  of this enormous line segment all its infinitely many parts , except a finite number of them , will inevitably lie within a final segment inconceivable less than , for instance , planck length ( @xmath3 cm ) . there is no way of performing a more equitable partition if the partition has to be @xmath1-ordered .",
    "thus , @xmath1-partitions  are @xmath1-asymmetrical .",
    "for the same reason it is impossible to consider two proper points in the real line @xmath4 separated by an infinite euclidean distance , in spite of the assumed infiniteness of the real line .",
    "the above simply unaesthetic consequences of @xmath1-partitions  become a little more controversial if the partitioned object is a closed line as a jordan curve .",
    "the objective of the following short discussion is just to examine one of those consequences .",
    "the @xmath1-order  makes it impossible a more equitable distribution of the available space . ]",
    "let @xmath5 be a real valued function whose graph is a jordan curve @xmath6 in the euclidean plane @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are any two @xmath6 s points , we will write @xmath10 to denote the length of the @xmath6 s arc @xmath11 whose endpoints are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "that is to say :       + assume that @xmath6 has an infinite euclidean length .",
    "in these conditions let @xmath13 be any proper real number greater than 0 and assume @xmath6 is partitioned clockwise from a point @xmath14 into a certain number of adjacent parts @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 so that each part @xmath19 has a finite length which is equal or greater than @xmath13 :       + evidently these partition @xmath21 must be infinite otherwise , and being finite the length of the parts , @xmath6 would have a finite length .",
    "in addition , and according to cantor @xcite , @xmath21 can not be uncountably infinite .",
    "in fact , consider the sequence of real numbers @xmath22 defined as :       + the one to one correspondence @xmath24 between @xmath25 and @xmath22 defined by @xmath26 proves that both sequence have the same cardinality .",
    "so if the first one were uncountably infinite so would be the second .",
    "but @xmath22 can not be uncountably infinite because if that were the case we could pick a different rational number @xmath27 in each real interval @xmath28 and then we would have an uncountable set of different rational numbers , which is obviously impossible @xcite .",
    "the partition @xmath29 must therefore be countably infinite .",
    "on the other hand , the adjacency of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 implies successiveness and then ordinality . accordingly @xmath29 must have a certain ordinal number , and taking into account its countable nature",
    ", this ordinal can only be transfinite , i.e. an ordinal of the second class according to cantor s classic terminology @xcite .",
    "now consider a point @xmath30 anticlockwise from @xmath14 and such that @xmath31 . according to ( [ eqn : fjc > = r ] ) @xmath30",
    "can only belong to the last element of @xmath29 .",
    "consequently this sequence must have a last element and then must be @xmath32-ordered , being @xmath33 a transfinite ordinal of the second class second kind , and @xmath34 a finite ordinal ; so that @xmath35 is an ordinal of the second class first kind .",
    "if must therefore exist an @xmath33-th second class second kind ordinal in @xmath29 so that @xmath36 can not have an immediate predecessor ( @xmath37 is the limit of a sequence of first kind ordinals ) .",
    "now then , according again to ( [ eqn : fjc > = r ] ) , the point @xmath38 anticlockwise from @xmath37 and such that @xmath39 can only belong to a part immediately preceding @xmath40 , which is impossible if @xmath37 is of the second kind , as it has to be .",
    "this proves that @xmath29 must be , but can not be , @xmath32-ordered , a contradiction we have derived from our initial assumption on @xmath6 infiniteness .",
    "we must therefore conclude that jordan curves of infinite length are inconsistent objects , and so must be any metrical space compatible with them .",
    "in addition , if @xmath6 is finite the above condition ( [ eqn : fjc > = r ] ) can no longer holds , otherwise @xmath6 would have an infinite length .",
    "therefore , transfinite partitions of jordan curves can only be of a decreasing part - length , i.e. @xmath0-asymmetrical ."
