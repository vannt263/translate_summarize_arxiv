    "the brightest source in the sky almost at any wavelength , the sun is very weak in high - energy ( @xmath0  mev ) gamma rays .",
    "this property can be used to study solar occultations of gamma - ray sources .",
    "the width of the point - spread function ( psf ) of telescopes detecting photons at these energies is quite large , of order several degrees . the enormous exposure of the fermi gamma ray space telescope ( the telescope previously known as glast ) would partially compensate for the poor resolution ; however , it would be almost impossible to directly measure the angular size of the image which may be smaller than the psf width .",
    "on the other hand , energetic gamma - ray images of distant sources may indeed have a significant angular size due to the cascading of photons on the background radiation and magnetic deflections of the cascade electrons and positrons .",
    "it has long been known that one can obtain the angular size of stars from lunar occultations , we suggest that one may determine the image size of gamma - ray sources screened by the sun .",
    "the current collection of known energetic gamma - ray point sources is scarce ( @xmath1 sources detected by egret ) , so only a few are expected to be on the strip on the sky such that they are screened by the sun .",
    "fortunately , the brightest egret source identified with an extragalactic object , 3c  279 , has an ecliptic latitude of @xmath2 and is screened by the sun on the 8th of october each year .",
    "it is 3c  279 which is the main subject of our discussion because , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : extended ] , it represents a perfect target for this kind of study .",
    "the simplest and most direct effect of an extended image size would be the detection of flux from the source during occultation .",
    "such a result could also be the signal of the transparency of the sun to gamma rays possible in several scenarios of new physics @xcite ; however the parameter space of particular models is strongly disfavoured by results of other experiments ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : egret ] , we review our analysis of archival egret data of the 1991 occultation of 3c  279 during which a non - zero flux was indeed observed , although at a very low statistical significance .    with a sensitive enough telescope , a more detailed study of the light curve during ingress and egress would be possible . in sec .",
    "[ sec : glast ] , we discuss the potential of fermi for this kind of a study and mention sources other than 3c  279 while sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "very high energy photons interact with other photons in the source , with photons along the path between the source and the earth and with photons near to the sun .",
    "these interactions result in the production of electrons and positrons which themselves consequently interact with the gamma - ray background leading to the developement of electromagnetic cascades which result in a gradual decrease of the average energies of propagating photons .",
    "ambient magnetic fields deflect the electrons and positrons and , as a result , the image of the source seen in gamma rays becomes extended .",
    "this kind of extended image may be observed for distant sources which emit very energetic photons ( both the universe and typical source environments are transparent for gamma rays below @xmath3  gev ) .",
    "recently , the magic collaboration has reported  @xcite the detection of @xmath4  gev emission from 3c  279 .",
    "given the expected absorbtion on the cosmic infrared background , this corresponds to an extremely high luminosity of the quasar at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "moreover , according to both the hillas criterion  @xcite and to bounds on the source parameters from energy losses ( see e.g.   @xcite ) , the jets of 3c  279 might provide the necessary conditions for the acceleration of cosmic rays ( cr ) up to ultra - high energies ( uhe ) , @xmath5  ev .",
    "3c  279 therefore seems to be an ideal candidate to search for an extended halo due to the production of secondary photons .",
    "let us summarize briefly a few different scenarios which could lead to the formation of an extended   gev ) .",
    "* it has been pointed out some time ago  @xcite that a halo of inverse - compton photons may form around the source of very high energy gamma rays .",
    "the estimates of  @xcite for the case of 3c  279 give rise to an expected angular size of the halo of @xmath6 and a flux from the halo approximately equal to the flux coming from the central point source .",
    "* synchrotron halo of uhecr sources ( @xmath7gev ) . * for reasonable values of the magnetic field",
    "( @xmath8  g ) around a source of uhecr , synchrotron photons contribute to a halo of angular size of a fraction of degree potentially detectable by fermi  @xcite .    * electromagnetic cascades on the intergalactic magnetic fields ( @xmath9  gev ) . *",
    "energetic photons from distant sources undergo electromagnetic cascades when scattering off extragalactic background light , resulting in extended images for tev sources  @xcite .",
    "even stronger cascading is expected for secondary photons from uhecr sources ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : because of their higher energies , they can scatter on cmb photons as well as the infrared background , and the number density of cmb photons is much higher .",
    "however , extended emission of this kind is too weak at gev energies to lead to a detectable effect .    * electromagnetic cascades on the solar radiation ( @xmath10  gev ) . *",
    "the solar radiation is strongly concentrated in the optical band , corresponding to the thermal emission of 5800  k , that is @xmath11  ev . the pair production threshold is determined by @xmath12  gev . the optical depth of the solar radiation with respect to the pair production for 260  gev photons tangent to the solar surface is @xmath13 and any secondary electrons and positrons produced in this way would be isotropised by the @xmath3  g magnetic field of the sun .",
    "because of this , the extended halo as viewed from earth would be too weak to be observable ( one may hope to detect such a halo when the sun passes in front of the regions with significant diffuse emission at 260  gev if such regions exist , but without the timing signature , this emission would be hard to detect ) .",
    "formation of the halo is a random process and therefore one expects that the variability timescale of the halo should be determined by its physical size ( light minutes for the solar neighbourhood but millions of light years for all other scenarios ) .",
    "we see that one might expect a halo around 3c  279 in the energy band detectable by egret and fermi ( above 100  mev ) .",
    "this halo is of angular size @xmath14 while the point - spread function ( psf ) of these instruments extends for several degrees .",
    "however , the halo could be detected when the sun screens the bright central source .",
    "study of the shape and spectrum of this halo would help to distinguish between various scenarios of its formation and therefore contribute to our understanding of the source engine , the source environment and the extragalactic background radiation .",
    "the extended halo would reveal itself in a smooth falling of the flux when the sun approaches the source and in a non - zero flux from the source while it is screened by the sun . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1 ] ,     normalized light curves of an extended source occulted by the sun , assuming gaussian model for the extended image .",
    "different values of the radial source variance @xmath15 are taken in units of degree .",
    "the time corresponds to the angle ( in degree ) between source center and the point of its minimal separation from the center of the solar disk , for the minimal separation of @xmath16 .",
    "the shadow region represents the occultation of the point - like source.,width=313 ]    we present examples of the lightcurves for various source extensions .",
    "in 1991 , the solar occultation of 3c  279 occured within the field of view of egret .",
    "we have analysed publicly available egret data to test the conjecture that the flux from the quasar was non - zero when the source was screened by the sun  @xcite ; here we present more details and discussions related to the study .",
    "given the coordinates of 3c  279 taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ( http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu ) and the coordinates of the sun calculated with the program planeph  @xcite , we are able to establish that the source was screened by the sun for 8 hours and 34 minutes . the minimal separation between the quasar and the center of the solar disk was @xmath16 while the angular radius of the sun at that period during the earth s orbit was @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "at that time ( viewing period 11.0 ) , egret was pointed in the direction of 3c  273 , some 5@xmath18 away from 3c  279 .",
    "the quasar was in a moderate state and was firmly detected in gamma rays during that viewing period  @xcite .",
    "the actual distribution of observed photons with their coordinates , energies and arrival times , as well as a record of the instrument s viewing modes , are available from the egret ftp site ( ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/egret ) . to calculate the exposure map for the period of occultation , we made use of the egret software  @xcite .    to determine the source flux , one compares the distribution of arrival directions of detected gamma - rays with the sum of background and point - source fluxes using a particular model for the former and the instrument point - spread function ( psf ) for the latter , both convolved with time- and direction - dependent experimental exposure .",
    "we denote the diffuse background flux of gamma rays from a given direction @xmath19 as @xmath20 .",
    "this flux was determined by @xcite from the analysis of the egret data . from @xmath20",
    ", we calculate @xmath21 , the expected flux of background photons within the angular distance @xmath22 from the source we study ( it is the integral over the corresponding circle on the sky , of @xmath20 weighted by exposure ) .",
    "the psf of egret , obtained by its careful calibration  @xcite , is energy dependent ; one has to assume some spectral index @xmath23 for the source .",
    "we use the psf for @xmath24  mev and @xmath25 ( the egret - measured spectral index of 3c279 is @xmath26  @xcite ) from @xcite and denote it as @xmath27 .    the number @xmath28 of observed photons from the circle of angular radius @xmath22 centered at the source ( a ladder - like function of a single variable @xmath22 ) is fitted by the sum of a slowly varying background and a sharp psf , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are parameters of the fit ( determined by the standard least - squares method . following the original 3eg procedure , @xcite",
    ", we keep the coefficient @xmath30 free motivated by possible temporal variations of the background ) and @xmath32 are contributions of known nearby sources ( for which we use the 3eg values for this viewing period ) .",
    "the best - fit number of source photons @xmath31 divided by the exposure determines the source flux . in the same way as the authors of the 3eg catalog , we select events with energies @xmath24  mev , tasc in coincidence at 6  mev and distance to the source not exceeding 15@xmath18 .",
    "these cuts correspond also to the psf we use .",
    "our approach is very similar to that used for the construction of the 3eg catalog ( see @xcite for more details of the method ) apart from some details :    1 .   we use the updated maps of egret - observed diffuse background  @xcite while @xcite used a theoretical model for the distribution of the background flux .",
    "the catalog construction used the counts distribution binned in two celestial coordinates ; we use the unbinned distribution in one coordinate ",
    "distance from the source ( both approaches were discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "this is more appropriate in the case of small number of observed events .",
    "the 3eg procedure substracts all 3-sigma sources ( in the catalog , they list only 4-sigma ones ) .",
    "we substract only the sources listed in the catalog , even if they are fainter than 4-sigma for this particular viewing period ( in this way , we potentially exclude some sources which did not pass the 4-sigma cut for this viewing period , or for any other viewing period or their sum , but were brighter than 3-sigma in this period ) .",
    "we performed the fit for the occultation period and for the rest of the viewing period .",
    "the best fits give the signal of @xmath33 photons for the occultation and @xmath34 for the rest of the viewing period . within the 68% containment angle of the psf , the numbers of signal and background photons are roughly equal .",
    "therefore we found some weak evidence for a non - zero point - source flux from the location of 3c  279 during the occultation , @xmath35  @xmath36  s@xmath37 , to be compared with the value obtained from the analysis of the rest of the same viewing period , @xmath38  @xmath36  s@xmath37 ( the value quoted in the 3eg catalog for this period is @xmath39  @xmath36  s@xmath37 ) . the zero flux ( point - like source ) is excluded at @xmath40 confidence level ( cl ) ; no upper limit can be placed on the source extension because unsuppressed flux is well within the 68% cl error bars .",
    "assuming a gaussian extended image , the best fit for the radial extension is @xmath41 .",

    "here we mention some possible subtleties which one should be aware of when trying to understand this result or similar future observations .",

    "further studies suggested potential identifications ; they also have been detected by fermi  @xcite the study of the solar occultation may help to determine their coordinates with higher precision , testing the identification .",
    "we expect that these ( and maybe other ) sources will become potential targets for angular - size measurements .",
    "it will be interesting to try and measure the angular sizes of images of energetic gamma  ray sources by means of observation of their solar occultations .",
    "the best target is 3c  279 , whose occultation happens each year on the 8th of october .",
    "egret observations made during such a period did not exclude the unsuppressed flux of the quasar when it was screened by the sun .",
    "the sensitivity of the fermi telescope is high enough that if the flux was unsuppressed during occultation , it could be observed more definitively than with egret .",
    "fermi can also constrain the angular size of the image even in the survey mode , and is capable of obtaining a light curve by the combination of several observations in the pointing mode . this would help to constrain models of particle acceleration and magnetic fields in and around the quasar .",
    "if the flux during the occultation exceeds the non - variable flux of the source ( as it is slightly favoured by the egret data ) , it would mean that either the extended image is formed relatively nearby or the sun is partially transparent for the point - like gamma - ray emission ( both options would mean a discovery of some unconventional physical or astrophysical phenomenon ) .",
    "the same method may be applied to refine the coordinates and/or to estimate the angular size of images of other gamma - ray sources screened by the sun .",
