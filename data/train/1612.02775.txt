    "polymeric magnets are known to be lighter and more flexible than conventional magnets .",
    "they can be easily manufactured to form thin films made of few layers and are currently considered as one of the main building blocks of the future generation of electronic devices . under external magnetic fields they form weiss domains whose",
    "wall energy is influenced by the thickness and the roughness of the film which in turn depends on the physical and chemical properties of the specific material at use .",
    "a fairly large amount of experimental results reconstruct the relation between film thickness and interfacial domain wall energy for different ferromagnetic materials ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but no rigorous explanation has appeared so far in this direction . among the reasons for such an unsatisfactory analysis we single out",
    "one which has a geometric flavour : depositing magnetic particles on a substrate to obtain a thin films leads to disordered arrangements of particles and rough film surfaces which makes very difficult to formulate a right ansatz leading to study the correct ( and simpler ) continuum model . in this paper",
    "we look at this problem from a different perspective : we single out a simple ising - type model for a thin film obtained by random deposition of magnetic particles on a flat substrate , for which the geometric part of the problem is still non trivial , and propose an ansatz - free variational analysis of such a film . combining @xmath1-convergence and percolation theory we finally obtain a rigorous explanation of the relation between film thickness and domain - wall energy in some asymptotic regimes .",
    "a simple way to model thin ferromagnetic polymeric materials at the micro scale first requires the definition of a polymeric matrix made of magnetic cells and then that of an interaction energy between those cells ( see @xcite and reference therein for further details ) .",
    "the polymeric matrix of such a system can be seen as a random network whose nodes are the cross - linkers molecules of the 3-d polymeric magnet , which are supposed to entail the local magnetic properties of the system and to interact as magnetic elementary cells via a ferromagnetic potts - type coupling .",
    "the system is supposed to be thin in the sense that the nodes of the matrix are within a small distance , of the order of the average distance between the nodes themselves , from a 2-d plane . in presence of an external magnetic field or of proper boundary conditions",
    ", the ferromagnetic coupling induces the system to form mesoscopic weiss domains , i.e. regions of constant magnetization .    in this paper",
    "we aim at upscaling the system described above from its microscopic description to a mesoscopic one in a variational setting .",
    "this consists in performing the limit of its energy as the average distance between the magnetic cells , which we denote by @xmath2 , goes to zero with respect to the macroscopic size of the system .",
    "such a limit will have two main effects : it will allow us to describe the original discrete system as a continuum while at the same time it will reduce its dimension from three to two ( or more in general from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with @xmath5 ) .",
    "the discrete - to - continuum analysis in this paper is also part of a general study of the effects of discreteness in lattice systems on their macroscopic description .",
    "it is directly related to a series of papers describing the overall behaviour of spin energies @xcite . moreover ,",
    "discrete - to - continuum analyses for thin elastic objects in a deterministic setting have also been considered , e.g.  in @xcite , and the behaviour of full - dimensional random lattices is dealt with in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for dimension - reduction problems for continuum elastic objects",
    "we also refer to @xcite , the latter introducing a dimensionally reduced localization argument similar to the one use in the present paper .    using the same model as in @xcite",
    "we describe the polymeric matrix as a random network whose nodes @xmath6 form a thin _ admissible stochastic lattice _ , meaning that the matrix is thin , i.e. there exist @xmath7 with @xmath5 and @xmath8 such that , identifying @xmath9 with a linear subspace of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and that it is admissible according to the following standard definition ( see @xcite and also @xcite in the framework of rubber elasticity ) .",
    "we say that @xmath12 is an admissible set of points if the following two requirements are satisfied :    * there exists @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for all @xmath15 , * there exists @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "within this definition we may include ` slices ' of periodic lattices @xcite , and also aperiodic geometries @xcite .",
    "given a probability space @xmath19 , a random variable @xmath20 is called an _ admissible stochastic lattice _ if , uniformly with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 is an admissible set of points .",
    "+ we assume that the magnetization takes only finitely many values , that is to say we consider configurations @xmath23 with a state - space @xmath24 that we embed in the euclidean space @xmath25 .",
    "we have in mind the case of spin systems , where @xmath26 .",
    "note that even in that case it is sometime necessary to use a larger set of parameters @xmath27 if frustration forces the formation of texture ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that if we have more than two parameters , we may have concentration phenomena of a third phase on the interfaces between two phases .",
    "a finer description of this phnomenon can be found in @xcite .    associating a voronoi tessellation @xmath28 to the lattice @xmath12 ,",
    "one introduces the set of nearest neighbours @xmath29 as the set of those pairs of points in @xmath12 whose voronoi cells share a @xmath30-dimensional edge .",

    "+ the dependence of such an energy on the randomness of the lattice is studied in section [ homogenization ] in the context of stochastic homogenization assuming the thin random lattice to be stationary ( or ergodic ) in the directions of the flat subspace to which it is close to and the interaction coefficients to be invariant under translation in these directions .",
    "more precisely we assume that there exists a measure - preserving group action @xmath66 on @xmath67 such that , almost surely in @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( if in addition @xmath66 is ergodic , then also the lattice @xmath69 is said to be ergodic ) and the following structural assumption : + * * hypothesis 2**there exist functions @xmath70 such that , setting @xmath71 , it holds @xmath72    in theorem [ mainthm2 ] we prove that under hypotheses @xmath73 and @xmath74 and assuming the stationarity ( or ergodicity ) in the sense specified above , the @xmath1-limit of @xmath49 as @xmath75 exists and is finite only on @xmath58 where it takes the form @xmath76 the energy density is given by an asymptotic homogenization formula which is averaged in the probability space under ergodicity assumptions on @xmath69 , thus turning the stochastic domain wall energy into a deterministic one .",
    "+ the result is proved by the abstract methods of gamma - convergence , first showing an abstract compactness result , and then giving an integral representation of the limit , as described in detail for deterministic bulk elastic thin films in @xcite ( for other applications of this method in a discrete - to - continuum setting see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the proof makes use of two main ingredients : the integral - representation theorem in @xcite and the subadditive ergodic theorem by ackoglu and krengel in @xcite .",
    "they are combined together following a scheme introduced in @xcite in the context of random discrete systems with limit energy on sobolev spaces ( see also @xcite ) and recently extended to sets of finite perimeter in @xcite .",
    "section [ sect - vol ] is devoted to extend the result above to the case of a volume constraint on the phases .",
    "+ an interesting issue in the theory of thin magnetic composite polymeric materials is the dependence of the domain wall energy on the random geometry of the polymer matrix .",
    "we devote the second part of the paper to this problem .",
    "we consider a specific model of a discrete system in which the state - space is @xmath77 and the stochastic lattice is generated by the random deposition of magnetic particles on a two - dimensional flat substrate . for simplicity",
    "we limit ourselves to a simple deposition model with vertical order and suppose that the magnetic interactions have finite range .",
    "we are interested in the dependence of the domain wall energy on the average thickness of the thin film . even though a complete picture would need a more extended treatment , thanks to percolation arguments we are able to attack the problem in the asymptotic cases when the thickness of the film is either small or very large .",
    "more specifically , we model the substrate ( where the particles are deposited ) by taking a two - dimensional deterministic lattice , which we choose for simplicity as @xmath78 .",
    "we then consider an independent random field @xmath79 , where the @xmath80 are bernoulli random variables with @xmath81 .",
    "for fixed @xmath82 we construct a random point set as follows : @xmath83 which means that we successively deposit particles @xmath84 times independently onto the flat lattice @xmath85 and stack them over each other ( the point set constructed is stationary with respect to translations in @xmath86 and ergodic ) .",
    "moreover , given @xmath87 , we consider an energy of the form @xmath88 where the interaction constant @xmath89 is finite range , bounded above and coercive on nearest - neighbours , so that the hypotheses 1 and 2 above are satisfied . as a result theorem [ mainthm2 ] guarantees the existence of a surface tension ,",
    "say @xmath90 given by an asymptotic cell formula .",
    "+ the main issue now is the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath91 and @xmath84 .",
    "+ a first result in this direction is proved in proposition [ layerdependence ] where we show that , for every direction @xmath92 , the wall energy density is linear in the average thickness @xmath93 as @xmath94 , that is @xmath95 with @xmath96 given in lemma [ auxlemma ] being the wall energy per unit thickness of the deterministic problem obtained for @xmath97 . + a second and more delicate result is contained in theorem [ almostpercolation ] and concerns a percolation type phenomenon which can be roughly stated as follows : when the deposition probability @xmath91 is sufficiently low ( below a certain critical percolation threshold ) the domain wall energy is zero for @xmath84 small enough . at this stage",
    "it is worth noticing that our energy accounts for the interactions between the deposited particles and the substrate .",
    "on one hand this assumption might be questionable from a physical point of view in the case one assumes to grow thin films on neutral media , thus expecting the properties of the film to be independent of the substrate .",
    "on the other hand removing such an interaction leads to a dilute model similar the one considered in @xcite .",
    "an adaption of this analysis would require a lot of additional work like the extension of fine percolation results to the ( range 1)-dependent case which goes far beyond the scopes of the present paper ( see also remark [ perc ] ) .",
    "we prove the percolation result for nearest - neighbour positive interactions . setting the interaction with the substrate",
    "to be @xmath98 we can prove that if @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 is the critical site percolation threshold in @xmath86 ) , the limit energy @xmath101 is bounded above ( up to a constant ) by @xmath102 for @xmath84 small enough .",
    "this result suggests the absence of a positive domain wall energy in the thin film on a neutral substrate ( @xmath103 case ) . in the limit",
    "as @xmath84 diverges holds with @xmath101 , which is independent of @xmath102 , thus showing that the contribution of the first layer does not affect the asymptotic average domain wall energy as expected .",
    "the proof of these results needs the extension to the dimension reduction framework of a result by caffarelli - de la lave @xcite about the existence of plane - like minimizers for discrete systems subject to periodic ising type interactions at the surface scaling .",
    "this is contained in the appendix to the paper .    as a final remark",
    ", we mention that we prove all our results in the case when the flat object is at least two - dimensional .",
    "most of the results can be extended to one - dimensional objects ( with the proof being much simpler ) , except the ones contained in section [ sect - vol ] which fail in dimension one as can be seen by simple examples and the percolation - type phenomenon in section [ sec - example ] as no percolation can occur in ( essentially ) one - dimensional lattices .",
    "this section is devoted to the precise description of the model we are going to study .",
