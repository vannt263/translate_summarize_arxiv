    "optical lattices in 3d generated by counterpropagating laser fields provide a periodic array of microtraps for cold atoms , and implement quantum lattice models governed by hubbard hamiltonians @xcite .",

    "two key elements of cold atom dynamics in 3d optical lattices are : ( i ) the lattice spacing is bounded below by the wavelength @xmath1 . therefore , all the relevant time , energy and temperature scales are determined by the recoil energy , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wavenumber , and @xmath4 is the the mass of the atom .",
    "in particular , the hopping matrix element between neighbouring sites within the region of validity of the single - band hubbard model is limited by @xmath5 .",
    "this limits all corresponding timescales , for example the timescale over which entanglement can be generated using exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "( ii ) varying the laser parameters provides _ global _ control of the lattice potential , but development of tools for local operations and readout remains a major challenge in light of applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "here we show how adiabatic potentials can be used to address these issues by creating addressable , state - dependent sub - wavelength lattices .",
    "each lattice period can be divided into a set of wells , which can be frequency - addressed via their offset energies , reminiscent of quantum computing schemes with electrons in arrays of electrically gated quantum dots @xcite .    in recent seminal experiments @xcite ,",
    "optical superlattices have been used to provide addressability and to entangle atoms in a series of double - wells in one parallel operation .",
    "our goal here is to achieve similar control on sub - wavelength scales by coupling optical lattice potentials with dressing fields , with the benefit that all corresponding timescales are significantly faster , and energy and temperature scales significantly higher .",
    "single particle effects of such dressed potentials @xcite have been studied , e.g. , in the context of lithography @xcite , laser cooling @xcite , and radio frequency ( rf)-dressed potentials on atom chips @xcite . here",

    "atoms loaded into different wells within the subwavelength structure can also be frequency - addressed via their different offset energies .    in view of recent seminal progress with alkaline - earth - like atoms , e.g. in the context of developing optical clocks @xcite , in many - body cold atom physics @xcite , and in applications in quantum information @xcite",
