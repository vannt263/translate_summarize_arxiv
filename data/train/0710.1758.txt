    "such vastly distinct systems as the classical and/or high @xmath0 cuprate superconductors , the ultracold superfluid fermion atoms as well as certain cosmological ( superfluid neutron stars ) and even subatomic objects ( odd - odd nuclei ) reveal signatures of ideally coherent pairs consisting of particles from a vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "obviously , what differs one case from another is an underlying mechanism and energy scale engaged in the pairing .",
    "they all however share the universal feature related to the effective bogoliubov quasiparticles representing a superposition of the fermion particles and their absence . this emerging particle - hole ( p - h ) mixing @xcite",
    "has a purely quantum nature ( imposed by the structure of the bcs wave function ) which to some extent resembles the corpuscular - wave dualism .",
    "one of its spectacular manifestations is the mechanism of subgap andreev reflection where an incident fermion - particle can convert into the pair with a simultaneous reflection of the fermion - hole what is indeed observed experimentally in superconductors @xcite , for the relativistic - like particles @xcite and in quantum dots attached to superconducting electrodes @xcite .    in the recent papers a.  balatsky and",
    "coworkers have emphasized that p - h mixing can be quantitatively probed by the present - day stm @xcite and arpes spectroscopies @xcite .",
    "these techniques are capable to determine either the spatially @xcite or momentum resolved @xcite single particle excitation spectra of superconductors . in principle also the simultaneous * k*- and * r*-space measurements are feasible by means of the fourier transformed quasiparticle interference imaging @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the p - h mixing manifests itself in the single particle spectra by appearance of two peaks around the fermi level separated by twice the ( pseudo)gap and whose spectral weigths yield the information on particle / hole contributions to the bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "usually for conventional superconductors these contributions are given by the bcs coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so it is convenient to define the bogoliubov angle @xcite @xmath3 as a measure of the particle - hole mixing .",
    "its magnitude can vary between @xmath4 and @xmath5 depending on a momentum and indirectly on temperature .",
    "@xmath6 has a particularly clear interpretation in the pseudospin representation @xmath7 , @xmath8 introduced by p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite , where it denotes an azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath9 .",
    "restricting to the part of hilbert space where @xmath10 the pseudospin eventually points down ( up ) when effective quasiparticles are represented by particles ( holes ) .",
    "the upper and bottom panels of figure [ fig1 ] illustrate such behavior well known for the normal and superconducting states @xcite .",
    "in general , pseudospins obey the non - trivial dynamics governed by the bloch - type equations of motion @xcite .",
    "this aspect has a particular importance in the context of ultracold atoms where traversing through the feshbach resonance can lead to the soliton - like solutions @xcite . on the other hand , in the highly inhomogeneous cuprate superconductors with pairing on a local ( interactomic ) distance both the excitation spectrum @xcite and the bogoliubov angle",
    "are strongly varying in space .",
    "such issue has been already explored within the bogoliubov de gennes approach and results were confronted with the available stm data @xcite .    since the bogoliubov angle ( [ ba ] ) is sensitive to existence of the paired fermions one may ask if any signatures of the p - h mixing would be able to appear above @xmath0 .",
    "arpes studies @xcite confirm that the superconducting state of cuprates obeys roughly the usual bcs behavior but there is still no firm agreement on the nature of pseudogap state and its relation to superconductivity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , various experimental data @xcite seem to indicate that preformed fermions pairs are present already in the normal state ( at least in the underdoped samples ) at temperatures up to dozen kelvin above @xmath0 .",
    "transition temperature might there correspond to the onset of long - range phase coherence @xcite .",
    "another evidence of the preexisting pairs above @xmath0 is known for the ultracold atoms of li@xmath11 and k@xmath12 . near the feshbach resonance",
    "the weakly bound boson molecules are scattered into the cooper - like pairs and such unitary limit is in a crossover between the bcs and bec regimes beeing influenced by strong quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to explore the impact of preformed pairs on the bogoliubov angle in the pseudogap state .",
    "in particular , we address the question whether p - h mixing can at all show up above @xmath0 and if so , then how it would manifest itself . for the considerations we use a phenomenological two - component model @xcite where itinerant fermions and their paired counterparts are introduced without referring to any specific microscopic mechanism . from the selfconsistent treatment of interactions between the paired and single fermions we find the evidence of particle - hole mixing signified by @xmath13",
    "furthermore , lack of the phase coherence above @xmath0 leads to a discontinuity of @xmath14 at @xmath15 . we will show that in the pseudogap state the bogoliubov angle behaves in a manner which partly resembles the normal and partly the superconducting phases ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in the next section we briefly introduce the model and discuss its main properties .",
    "methodological details are presented in section iii and the essential part on the p - h mixing for the pseudogap state is described in section iv .",
    "we finally summarize our results and point out some related unresolved problems .",
    "for modelling the pseudogap state we use the following hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath16    where operators @xmath17 refer to annihilation ( creation ) of single fermions with the energy @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the local pairs of energy @xmath20 .",
    "potential of the interaction between the single and paired fermions is denoted by @xmath21 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that concentration of pairs per lattice site is small enough so that @xmath19 obey the usual bosonic commutation relations ( we neglect the hard - core effect ) .",
    "this model ( [ bf ] ) has been invented @xcite and explored by j.  ranninger with coworkers @xcite and independently by t.d .",
    "lee et al @xcite as well as some other groups .",
    "starting from various microscopic models several authors @xcite have also concluded that the relevant physics of strongly correlated cuprates is well captured by the fermion and boson degrees of freedom expressed by the hamiltonian ( [ bf ] ) .",
    "moreover , such model well describes the ultracold fermion atoms interacting with the feshbach resonance @xcite .    in the simplest mean - field approach",
    "one can linearize the interaction term so that the decoupled boson and fermion parts become exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum of fermions has then bcs structure @xmath22 with the usual quasiparticle energy @xmath23 and coherence factors @xmath24 $ ] which lead to the standard bogoliubov angle .",
    "energy gap of the single particle excitation spectrum is effectively given by @xmath25 .",
    "this means that fermions undergo transition to the superconducting state if and only if the bose - einstein condensation of bosons takes place @xcite . actually , the latter property is valid exactly @xcite without limitations to any approximation .",
    "the mean - field treatment does not take into account the quantum fluctuations whose efficiency increases upon approaching @xmath0 and above of it . in the next section we present the method which enables a selfconsistent study of the boson - fermion feedback effects .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the remnants of superconducting correlations above @xmath0 and study their effect on the bogoliubov angle .",
    "for studying the model ( [ bf ] ) we use the selfconsistent , non - perturbative procedure based on a canonical transformation @xmath26 with a continuous formal parameter @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to eliminate the interaction part @xmath21 through a sequence of infinitesimal steps @xmath28 .",
    "proceeding along the lines of the renormalization group ( rg ) technique one starts from renormalizing the high energy sector and subsequently turns to the low energy sector ( by latter we mean the fermion states close to @xmath29 and boson states near @xmath30 ) .",
    "we briefly describe some technicalities in order to clarify how the particle and hole spectral contributions can be evaluated within this procedure .",
    "practically we start by setting @xmath31 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the initial hamiltonian , and then construct the flow equation @xmath33 $ ] with the generating operator @xmath34 . following the original proposal of wegner @xcite we choose @xmath35 $ ] , where @xmath36 denotes the total kinetic energy of fermions and bosons whereas @xmath37 stands for their interaction . from a straightforward algebra",
    "we obtain @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "one can prove analytically @xcite that such antihermitean operator @xmath40 indeed guaranties an asymptotic disappearance of the boson - fermion coupling @xmath41 .    applying this scheme to the boson - fermion hamiltonian ( [ bf ] )",
    "we obtain the following set of coupled flow equations @xcite @xmath42 we have solved them numerically considering fermions coupled with bosons on a lattice avoiding thus any need for the infrared cutoffs .",
    "the fixed point values @xmath43 turned out to reveiled the following features :    * for @xmath44 the renormalized fermion dispersion @xmath45 develops a true gap at @xmath29 which evolves into a pseudogap for @xmath46 , * the effective boson dispersion @xmath47 shows the long - wavelength goldstone mode for @xmath44 and its remnants are preserved even in the pseudogap state @xcite .    for a complete information about the fermion and boson spectra",
    "we need to proceed with transformations for the individual operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 which is a rather difficult task because @xmath50 is not known explicitly . since our primary interest is in estimating the particle - hole mixing for the single particle fermion excitations we focus on the flow equation @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the generating operator @xmath40 chosen according to wegner s prescription @xcite yields the following ansatz for fermion operators @xcite @xmath52 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "c_{-{\\bf k}\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}(l ) & = &   - v_{\\bf k}^{*}(l ) \\ ; c_{{\\bf k}\\uparrow } + u_{\\bf k}^{*}(l ) \\ ; c_{-{\\bf k}\\downarrow}^{\\dagger }   \\label{cbis_ansatz}\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\ !",

    "the @xmath27-dependent coefficients must be determined from the following set of flow equations @xcite @xmath55 we explored them numerically along with the equations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 on the 2-dimensional square lattice with the initial ( @xmath54 ) tight - binding dispersion @xmath59 and the localized boson energy @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , we imposed @xmath61 to obtain the d - wave symmetry of energy gap ( pseudogap ) below ( above ) @xmath0 .",
    "we solved the coupled flow equations iteratively by the runge - kutta method for @xmath62 keeping a fixed charge concentration @xmath63 when the concentration of fermions @xmath64 yield the realistic value @xmath65 . in figures",
    "[ fig2]-[angle ] we present the results obtained along the antinodal direction @xmath66 i.e.  for @xmath67 .",
    "our ansatz ( [ c_ansatz],[cbis_ansatz ] ) generalizes the standard bogoliubov - valatin transformation by including the effect of scattering on finite momentum preformed pairs .",
    "influence of such scattering shows up in the effective single particle spectral function which takes the following form    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 denote the asymptotic @xmath73 values .",
    "we have determined them numerically solving the flow equations ( [ p_flow]-[r_flow ] ) for the fixed total charge concentration @xmath74 .",
    "the structure of spectral function ( [ a_sc ] ) indicates that besides the narrow peaks ( long - lived states ) there also forms a background of the damped ( finite life - time ) states .",
    "if we neglected @xmath75 and @xmath76 then the flow equations ( [ p_flow],[r_flow ] ) would simplify to @xmath77 and @xmath78 yielding the invariance @xmath79 . by rewriting the first equation as @xmath80 we then right away reproduce the mean - field solution @xmath81 . in order to go beyond this bcs solution we need to take into account the effect of scattering on the finite momentum pairs affecting the spectral function ( [ a_sc ] ) through the coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we shall do it for @xmath84 .",
    "preformed pairs occupy in the normal phase only the finite momenta states ( in other words @xmath85 ) therefore the equations ( [ r_flow ] , [ p_flow ] ) imply @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ c_ansatz],[cbis_ansatz ] ) is thus above @xmath0 simplified to @xmath88 and the corresponding spectral function becomes @xmath89 the first term in ( [ spectral ] ) represents the long - lived states at the renormalized energies @xmath90 whose spectral weight is @xmath91 .",
    "remaining part of the spectrum is distributed among the damped fermion states .",
    "most of them are almost insensitive to temperature and can be regarded as an incoherent background .",
    "however , there is a certain fraction ( very important to us ) of a different character ",
    "these states emerge around @xmath92 near the fermi surface as shown in figure [ fig2 ] . such partly broadened excitation branch , being sort of a mirror reflection of the quasiparticle dispersion @xmath93 , corresponds to the hole ( particle ) contribution for momenta below ( above ) @xmath15 .",
    "these ingredients allow us to estimate the bogoliubov angle ( [ ba ] ) in the pseudogap state and our procedure for determining the particle and hole weights is illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "to support this treatment we recall some analytical argument explaining appearance of the bogoliubov shadow branch upon approaching @xmath0 from above . for a decreasing temperature",
    "the preformed pairs start populating the lower and lower energies so that @xmath94 is dominated by the states located just above @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting spectral function ( [ spectral ] ) reduces then to @xmath96 where the last term describes solely the structureless incoherent background .",
    "we obtained @xmath97 by integrating the spectral function with respect to @xmath98 for a given @xmath99 and subtracting from it the integrated spectral function for high temperatures .",
    "we notice that near @xmath15 the long - lived state and its mirror reflection ( a shadow ) do not merge because of a finite value of the pseudogap @xmath100 .",
    "figure [ angle ] shows the calculated bogoliubov angle as a function of momentum measured with respect to the fermi surface . in the pseudogap region",
    "the shadow branch has a substantial effect on the bogoliubov angle leading to the p - h mixing near @xmath15 . yet , exactly at the fermi surface the bogoliubov angle is discontinuous .",
    "the bcs - type behavior is finally recovered at temperatures @xmath101 as marked by the open circles in figure [ angle ] .",
    "since the magnitude of superconducting gap does not much change @xcite the bogoliubov angle is below @xmath0 practically frozen ( temperature - independent ) .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of strong superconducting fluctuations above the transition temperature @xcite where the single fermions coexist and interact with the preformed pairs .",
    "influence of pairs on the single particle excitation spectrum has been studied within the selfconsistent rg - like method @xcite .",
    "we have found that near @xmath102 the renormalized dispersion @xmath103 is depleted above @xmath0 and additionally there appears a shadow branch in the fermion spectrum responsible for the particle - hole mixing .",
    "we have estimated the particle and hole spectral weights thereby determining the bogoliubov angle for the normal state with preformed pairs .",
    "we have found that momentum dependence of the bogoliubov angle in the pseudogap regime differs qualitatively from its behavior for the normal and superconducting states . in the normal state ( where particle - hole mixing is absent )",
    "@xmath6 changes abruptly at @xmath15 from @xmath4 to @xmath5 whereas in the superconducting state ( below @xmath0 ) the bogoliubov angle continuously evolves between these extreme values over an energy regime @xmath104 , so that particle and hole excitations are mixed with one another . in the pseudogap regime we find that @xmath105 but still at the fermi surface the bogoliubov angle is discontinuous .",
    "we hope that stm and arpes techniques would be able to detect such unconventional relation between the particle and hole weights predicted for the systems with strong pairing fluctuations .",
