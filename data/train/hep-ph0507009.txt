    "one of main goals of future colliders is to find a higgs boson . in order to establish the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking it will in addition be necessary to measure the properties of the higgs boson , hopefully allowing to distinguish between different models .",
    "while the lhc will almost certainly take the prize of finding a higgs @xcite , if it exists , it will take the international linear collider ( ilc ) to nail down many of the properties @xcite to the desired level of accuracy .",
    "unlike in the standard model ( sm ) , where the higgs mass is only rather loosely constrained by higher - order effects , the higgs couplings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite are directly related , through supersymmetry , to the gauge couplings .",
    "this implies that the lightest higgs - boson mass @xmath0 can be predicted in terms of the other model parameters .",
    "the mass measurement at the ilc is estimated to @xmath1 gev @xcite , thus @xmath0 will become a precision observable .    together , these two issues mandate precise calculations of observables on the theory side in a variety of models , but in particular in supersymmetric ones , where @xmath0 is a prediction .",
    "the feynhiggs @xcite package provides masses , couplings , branching ratios , etc .  in the real , complex , and non - minimal flavour - violating mssm including state - of - the - art radiative corrections",
    "the mssm contains two higgs doublets , @xmath2 where a possible cp - violating phase @xmath3 has been indicated .",
    "the higgs potential is given by @xmath4 the only non - trivial cp - violating phase ( besides @xmath3 ) is contained here in @xmath5 .",
    "at tree level all cp phases can be rotated away , giving five physical states of distinct cp parity : @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( cp - even ) , @xmath8 ( cp - odd ) , and @xmath9 .",
    "the quartic higgs couplings are completely determined by the gauge couplings @xmath10 and @xmath11 and this leads to the well - known tree - level prediction @xmath12 , which stands in conflict with measurements since lep .",
    "fortunately ( for the mssm ) , significant quantum loop contributions push the upper bound on @xmath0 up to about 140 gev @xcite for a top mass of 178 gev .",
    "but the quantum effects lead also to qualitative changes . in the presence of cp - violating phases ,",
    "all three neutral higgs bosons mix and cp is no longer conserved @xcite , @xmath13 the three mass eigenstates are denoted as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and ordered as @xmath16 .",
    "installing feynhiggs is simple and fast .",
    "version 2.2 requires no prerequisites ( e.g.  looptools ) as before .    *",
    "get the latest feynhiggs tar file from ` http://www.feynhiggs.de ` . *",
    "unpack , configure , and build : + ` tar xfz feynhiggs-2.2.n.tar.gz ` + ` cd feynhiggs-2.2.n ` + ` ./configure ` + ` make ` + to build also the mathematica part , replace `` ` make ` '' by `` ` make all ` '' . *",
    "( optional : ) type `` ` make install ` '' to install the files and `` ` make clean ` '' to remove intermediate files .",
    "feynhiggs operates in one of four basic modes :    * library mode : the feynhiggs routines are invoked from a fortran or c / c++ program linked against the feynhiggs library . * command - line mode : parameter files in feynhiggs native format or in susy les houches accord ( slha ) @xcite format are processed at the command line with the standalone executable ` feynhiggs ` . *",
    "www mode : the user interactively chooses parameters at the feynhiggs user control center ( fhucc ) and obtains the results on - line at ` http://www.feynhiggs.de/fhucc ` .",
    "* mathematica mode : the feynhiggs routines can be used in mathematica via the mathlink executable ` mfeynhiggs ` .      the feynhiggs library ` libfh.a ` is a static fortran 77 library .",
    "its global symbols are prefixed with a unique identifier to minimize symbol collisions .",
    "the library contains only subroutines ( no functions ) , so that no include files are needed ( except for the couplings ) and the invocation from c / c++ is hassle - free .",
    "detailed debugging output can be turned on at run time .",
    "all routines are described in detail in the api guide and on man - pages , so only a brief overview is needed here :    * ` fhsetflags ` sets the flags of the calculation . * ` fhsetpara ` sets the mssm input parameters directly . * ` fhsetslha ` extracts the input parameters from an slha data structure .",
    "* ` fhsetdebug ` sets the debugging level . * ` fhgetpara ` retrieves ( some of ) the derived parameters .",

    "* non - minimal flavour - violating effects ( e.g.  @xmath28@xmath29 mixing ) @xcite . * ` fhuncertainties ` estimates the uncertainties of the higgs masses and mixings .",
    "the total uncertainty is the sum of deviations from the central value , @xmath30 , where * * @xmath31 is obtained by varying the renormalization scale ( entering via the @xmath24 renormalization ) within @xmath32 , * * @xmath33 is obtained by using @xmath34 instead of the running @xmath35 in the two - loop corrections , * * @xmath36 is obtained by using an unresummed bottom yukawa coupling , @xmath37 , i.e.  an @xmath37 including the leading @xmath26 corrections , but not resummed to all orders . * ` fhcouplings ` computes the higgs couplings , decay widths , and brs in the mssm and also for an sm higgs boson with mass @xmath38 ( denoted as @xmath39 ) for comparison : @xmath40 * ` fhhiggsprod ` calculates approximately ( by means of effective couplings ) the following inclusive higgs production cross - sections : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xcite . * ` fhconstraints ` evaluates several electroweak precision observables , to be used as additional constraints : * * @xmath47 at @xmath48 @xcite .",

    "the feynhiggs command - line frontend , ` feynhiggs ` , reads input files both in its own and in slha format .",
    "the feynhiggs format simply lists the parameters and their values , for example :    ....    mt          178    mb          4.7    mw          80.450    mz          91.1875    tb          50    ma0         200    msusy       975    ... ....    more sophisticated variants are possible , e.g.  `` ` tb 5 50 2.5 ` '' declares a loop over ` tb ` = @xmath51 from 5 to 50 in steps of 2.5 .",
    "this input file , e.g.  ` fh.in ` , is run through feynhiggs by    ....    feynhiggs fh.in ....",
    "optionally , the flags can be given behind the filename as a string of digits , as in    ....    feynhiggs fh.in 40020211 ....    the output is listed on stdout in a human - readable form , for example    .... --------------------- higgs masses ---------------------                    ---------------- estimated uncertainties ---------------           ...",
    "....    the listing can become quite lengthy , and although feynhiggs automatically spawns a pager for easier viewing , one would sometimes like to mask off the details .",
    "such lines contain a % character , thus    ....     feynhiggs fh.in | grep -v % ....    turns off the details .    to convert the human - readable into a machine - readable form , the ` table ` utility is used . for example , the following line produces a file ` fh.out ` with two columns , ` tb ` and ` mh0 ` ,    ....     feynhiggs fh.in | table tb mh0 > fh.out ....    the slha mode works similarly , only that the output is not listed on screen , but saved in a file ( input filename plus `` ` .fh ` '' ) , again in slha format .",
    "this way , feynhiggs can act as a filter in a chain of commands operating on an slha file .",
    "feynhiggs tries to read each input file in slha format first and if that fails , falls back into its native format .",
    "feynhiggs slha interface uses the slha library @xcite .",
    "feynhiggs can be used interactively in www mode or in mathematica mode . in www mode ,",
    "point your browser to the feynhiggs user control center at ` http://www.feynhiggs.de/fhucc ` .",
    "the web interface allows to select one of the les houches benchmark scenarios , or choose each parameter directly .",
    "[ fig : fhucc ] shows a screen shot .    the feynhiggs user control center . ]    a much more powerful interactive environment is provided by the mathematica interface of feynhiggs .",
    "the mathlink executable ` mfeynhiggs ` must first be loaded with    ....     install[\"mfeynhiggs \" ] ....    and makes all feynhiggs routines ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : api ] ) available as mathematica functions .",
    "standard mathematica functions , such as ` contourplot ` and ` findminimum ` , then make some sophisticated analyses possible .",
    "the feynhiggs package computes higgs masses , mixing angles , branching ratios , couplings , etc .  in the mssm including state - of - the - art radiative corrections .",
