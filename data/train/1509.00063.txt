    "swarming of animals , for example schooling of fish , flocking of birds or herding of mammals , is one of the most commonly observed in the real world but challenging to study phenomena in biology .",
    "swarm behaviour is an awe - inspiring collective behavior exhibited by animals .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon has already attracted interest of researchers from diverse fields including biology , physics , mathematics , computer engineering .",
    "we can not give a complete description of the literature , but let us give references to some selection of papers .",
    "vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite modeled the movement of self - driven particles by difference equations .",
    "they assumed that each individual is driven with a sum of an absolute velocity which is constant and an average velocity of nearby particles together with some random perturbation .",
    "oboshi et al .",
    "@xcite also modeled schooling by difference equations setting a rule that each individual choose one way of action among four possibilities according to a distance to the closest mate . in the meantime , olfati - saber @xcite and dorsogna et al .",
    "@xcite presented differential equation models , but deterministic ones , utilizing the generalized morse function and attractive / repulsive potential functions , respectively .",
    "gunji et al .",
    "@xcite considered dual interaction which produces territorial and schooling behavior .    in the excellent monograph ,",
    "camazine et al .",
    "@xcite , presented an insight of picking up the following behavioral rules of individual fish :    1 .",
    "the school has no leaders and each fish follows the same behavioral rules .",
    "2 .   to decide where to move",
    ", each fish uses some form of weighted average of the position and orientation of its nearest neighbors .",
    "3 .   there is a degree of uncertainty in the individual s behavior that reflects both the imperfect information - gathering ability of a fish and the imperfect execution of the fish s actions .    we should mention that these three rules are based on empirical results aoki @xcite , huth - wissel @xcite and warburton - lazarus @xcite .",
    "and similar assumptions , but deterministic ones , were also introduced by reynolds @xcite .    based on this idea ,",
    "the authors of the present paper published a few papers in the view point of mathematical science . in uchitane - ton - yagi @xcite , we used stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) to construct a mathematical model describing the process of schooling of @xmath0-fish system in a free space , i.e. the euclidean space @xmath1 in linh - ton - yagi @xcite , we gave quantitative investigations for that model .",
    "we introduced several new quantitative notions such as distance to school mates , minimum distance , mean distance to school mates , diameter of school , variance of velocity , @xmath2-graph school and @xmath3-schooling , to measure the geometrical structure of school .",
    "we then performed many numerical computations to clarify some important modeling parameters effects on determining geometry of structures of school . in linh - ton - yagi @xcite",
    ", we presented a mathematical model of sdes which describe the movement of individuals in environment with the presence of obstacle . to construct that model",
    ", we introduced a local rule for obstacle avoidance of fish schooling :    1 .",
    "each fish executes an action for avoiding an obstacle according to the reflection law of velocity with a distance dependent weight .",
    "thanks to the model , we discovered very interesting four obstacle avoidance patterns of fish schooling , named rebound , pullback , pass and reunion , and separation .",
    "in addition , we showed how these patterns change as crucial modeling parameters change .    in this study , we are interested in a remarkable phenomenon : animals swarm to find resource of food in noisy environment with the presence of obstacles .",
    "a question is that does swarming give any advantage for foraging .",
    "there is a huge number of ecological literature on this phenomenon , which can not be listed here .",
    "the reader can find a large number of references in the monograph @xcite .",
    "there are several literature describing this phenomenon from a mathematical point of view ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it seems that no sde model for this phenomenon exists .",
    "a model written in terms of sdes is very useful .",
    "first , the behavior rules of individual animals can be described precisely .",
    "second , an sde model is tractable for mathematical treatments , especially doing numerical simulations .    in this paper , based on our previous models ,",
    "we will present a sde model for describing foraging fish schooling in noisy environment with the presence of obstacles . in the following ,",
    "we use the term  fish schooling \" instead of  animal swarming \" for specification .",
    "however , the results are applicable for any animal swarming in general .",
    "we set a situation    * the school of fish is put in a limited region . * food is put at a single spot in the region . *",
    "fish and food are separated by obstacles .",
    "* fish can not reach the feeding spot in a straightforward way .    then , we newly introduce a local rule for foraging :    1 .",
    "each fish is sensitive to the gradient of potential formed by the concentration of scent which is emitted by food and has tendency to move into a higher direction .",
    "we shall write out this rule into a mathematical formula and integrate it into our previous models to obtain the desired model .",
    "numerical results obtained from this model show that if the population size of the school is very small , then the school can not find the feeding spot ; on the contrary , if it is large enough , then the school can enjoy an advantage of population size to find out covered food .",
    "this , in fact , shows qualitative agreement to an empirical evidence that fish derive enhanced foraging success from schooling behavior ( see pitcher - parrish @xcite ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we introduce our sde models .",
    "subsections [ sec2.1 ] and [ sec2.2 ] review sde models in free space and in obstacle domain .",
    "subsection [ sec2.3 ] presents formulation for the local rule ( e ) and the sde model for fish schooling in noisy environment with the presence of obstacles and resource of food .",
    "section [ sec3 ] describes numerical example setting .",
    "the advantages of schooling for foraging will be shown by means of simulation results in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusion in section [ section5 ] .",
    "[ subsec:11 ] more recently , three behavioral rules ( a)-(c ) mentioned above were written out into a mathematical model in @xcite .",
    "our sde model for an @xmath0-individual system reads as @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 denote the position and the velocity , respectively , of the @xmath8th individual at time @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the euclidean norm of a vector .",
    "we regard each individual as a moving particle in the free space @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the first equation is a stochastic equation for the unknown @xmath5 , where @xmath13 denotes a stochastic differentiation of a @xmath14-dimensional independent brownian motion defined in a probability space with filtration .",
    "the second equation is a deterministic equation for @xmath6 , where @xmath15 are fixed exponents ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are positive coefficients of attraction and velocity matching among individuals , respectively . and @xmath18 is a fixed number .",
    "if @xmath19 then the @xmath8th individual moves toward the @xmath20th ; to the contrary , if @xmath21 then the @xmath8th individual acts in order to avoid collision with the @xmath20th individual . the quantity @xmath22 therefore plays as the critical distance ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity matching of the @xmath8th individual to the @xmath20th individual also has a similar weight depending on the distance @xmath23 .",
    "degree of matching is higher when @xmath21 than the contrary case in order to avoid collisions . in the meantime",
    ", the exponent @xmath24 denotes a degree of how far the attraction reaches .",
    "if @xmath24 is large , then the attraction range is small . to the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath24 is small , then individuals can attract each other even if there is a distance among them .",
    "the function @xmath25 stands for an external force function acting on the @xmath8th individual .",
    "the main advantage of using sde models like may be the easiness of mathematical treatments .",
    "one can utilize the well - developed theory of sdes and the numerical methods ( see @xcite )",
    ". its flexibility may be another advantage . as seen below",
    ", we can make new models , for example , ones in environment with the presence of obstacles and source of food simply by introducing suitable external force functions @xmath26 in .      our sde model in an obstacle domain",
    "was presented in @xcite , where the obstacle is assumed to be a compact sphere .",
    "let us review that model with slightly change the shape of obstacle .",
    "we restrict ourselves with considering a static obstacle whose surface @xmath27 consists of a part of the flat plane or a part of sphere .    in the latter case , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is center and @xmath30 is radius of the sphere .",
    "base on local rule ( d ) mentioned in section [ introduction ] , we formulate the external force function @xmath26 influencing the motion of the @xmath8th individual .    for a given @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , the vector @xmath33 called the reflection vector of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath27 is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath35 be the ray with origin @xmath36 and direction @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath37 when @xmath35 first meets @xmath27 with point @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the reflection vector of @xmath34 with respect to the tangential plane of @xmath27 at the point @xmath40 . in a particular case ,",
    "say @xmath35 passes @xmath29 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "meanwhile , when @xmath35 does not meet @xmath27 ( including the case when @xmath42 ) , we define @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) illustrates @xmath44 and @xmath39 in two dimensional case .",
    "in the formal case , i.e. , @xmath27 is a part of flat plane , @xmath39 is defined analogously ( see figure [ fig1](b ) ) .    throughout this paper , the domain @xmath45 in which the fish are allowed to move around",
    "is assumed to be surrounded by several components which are all a part of plane or a part of sphere .",
    "therefore , we can define for @xmath44 , the reflection vector @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the boundary of @xmath48 . by our formulation , each fish",
    "is affected locally from the boundary @xmath47 through a small pinpoint part of it at each moment . as for other formulation owing to global affections",
    ", we refer to the paper @xcite .",
    "analogously to the velocity matching , local affection from @xmath47 to the motion of the @xmath8-th fish is then described by @xmath49.\\ ] ] here , @xmath50 is a point at which the fish is feared to come into collision , @xmath51 is a fixed distance , @xmath52 is a constant and @xmath53 are exponents . if @xmath54 then the reaction for avoiding obstacles is not so strong ; to the contrary , if @xmath55 then the fish reacts more promptly in order to match its velocity to @xmath56 .",
    "if the ray @xmath35 and @xmath27 intersect , the fish takes no reaction with the obstacle .",
    "thus , our model is written by a system of stochastic differential equations : @xmath57\\\\       & \\quad + g_i(x_i , v_i)\\bigl]dt ,   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes again an external force function acting on the @xmath8th individual . in @xcite , we take @xmath59 for all @xmath8 .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall newly introduce a sde model with obstacles and resource of food .",
    "let us make a precise formulation of the local rule ( e ) of foraging . in formulating foraging execution of fish ,",
    "we follow the method of potential functions .",
    "let @xmath60 be a source function defined for @xmath61 .",
    "consider the elliptic equation @xmath62 in @xmath48 under the homogeneous neumann boundary condition on @xmath47 .",
    "here , @xmath63 denotes the concentration of scent emitted by the food resource at @xmath64 .",
    "the operator @xmath65 is the laplace operator in @xmath48 , @xmath66 is a diffusion constant , @xmath67 is a declining rate of @xmath63 and @xmath68 denotes the ( typically exterior ) normal to the boundary @xmath47 .    we regard @xmath63 as a potential function .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath8-th fish is at a position @xmath36 in @xmath48 at some moment , then the external force @xmath58 in affected from the resource is @xmath69 with some sensitivity constant @xmath70 , that is @xmath71 ( @xmath58 does not depend on velocity @xmath34 ) .",
    "the boundary condition in ensures that no scent can enter or leave the boundary of the domain , i.e. , the domain is perfectly insulated .",
    "we are now ready to state the model equations for foraging fish schooling model in noisy environment with the presence of obstacles .",
    "the equations are performed by , where @xmath72 are defined by and .",
    "let us restate that equations : @xmath73\\\\   & \\quad + k\\nabla u(x_i)\\bigl]dt , \\end{aligned}\\\\ \\begin{aligned } & -c\\delta u+a u= f(x ) ,     &   \\hspace{2cm}x\\in \\omega , \\\\ & \\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\text{\\bf n}}= 0 ,   &    \\hspace{2cm}x \\in \\partial \\omega . \\end{aligned }   \\end{cases}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we will present numerical examples of the model .",
    "these examples will show the roles of schooling in helping fish to find food resources . for simplicity , we will only demonstrate results in two dimensional case .    in our simulations",
    ", we restrict the space for fish swimming in to be the rectangle domain @xmath74\\times [ 0 , 4]\\subset \\mathbb r^2 $ ] whose boundary are wall obstacles . inside this domain , we put three other obstacles    * @xmath75\\times[1.75,4]$ ] . *",
    "@xmath76\\times [ 0,2.5]$ ] .",
    "* @xmath77 is the half of the circle centered at @xmath78 with radius 0.25 defined as @xmath79\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( @xmath80 is a connected domain . from the left , the highest point of @xmath77 is the lowest point of @xmath81 .",
    "the situation is the same for the right side ) .",
    "we specify the area where the fish can move in is @xmath82 . by the neumann condition , scent also can not pass the boundary @xmath47 of this area .",
    "we let fish group take random initial positions in the small rectangle @xmath83\\times [ 3.5 , 4]$ ] on the upper left corner of the domain .",
    "fish group aims to arrive at food location which is represented by the small circle centered at @xmath84 with radius @xmath85 .",
    "more precisely , we specify the food resource function in or as @xmath86 we can find the scent function @xmath87 from @xmath88 specified in by solving with @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "the function @xmath87 for the above setting is shown in figure [ bb2fig4 ] .    ]    in order to survey positive effect of schooling on foraging tasks , we consider the role of school population size on the process of finding food resource .",
    "in doing so , we make simulations using our model with all parameters are fixed except for @xmath0 , which is the number of fish in the school .",
    "we will change @xmath0 from 1 to 20 . for each value of @xmath0",
    "we take 10 independent runs .",
    "the simulations start at initial positions of @xmath0-fish randomly distributed in the rectangle domain @xmath83\\times [ 3.5,4]$ ] with all null velocities @xmath91 .",
    "other parameters are set @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we also included a parameter @xmath98 to restrict the maximum speed of fish .",
    "if the magnitude of @xmath34 exceeds @xmath98 , our program rescaled it to magnitude @xmath98 while preserving its direction .",
    "this is reasonable because each species of fish has a tolerance of speed that they can not exceed .",
    "that is , @xmath99 in our experiments we choose @xmath100 .",
    "in this section , we present our simulation results which suggest the foraging advantage of schooling . more precisely , we see that a group of 20 fish can approach to food resource location after a period of time ( see figure [ 20fishschool ] ) , while a 5-fish group can not ( see figure [ 5fishschool ] ) .",
    "the situation is even worse when there is only one fish . in this case , the fish is trapped , it can not pass even the first obstacle ( see figure [ 1fishschool ] ) . in each of these three figures , four subfigures , from the left to right and then from the top to bottom , respectively present state of school at different instants @xmath101 .",
    "the position of food resource represented by the small circle on the lower right hand side of @xmath102 .",
    "positions and velocities of each fish are drawn by a marker and a vector , respectively .",
    "when fish in group all lie on the left side of @xmath81 , the value of sensitivity coefficient is very small , so their movements are affected mostly by the fish - fish interaction ( including attraction / repulsion and velocity matching ) and fish - obstacle collision avoidance rules .",
    "because of that , fish together make school very fast .",
    "then all fish in the school will move together when interaction coefficient between them is chosen large enough .    in order to report our statistic results",
    ", we will classify the observed results into 3 states as follows .",
    "* state i * : the school reaches the goal at @xmath103 , that is at the 120,000-th step .    * state ii * : the whole or a part of the school has pass the left wall of @xmath81 but has not reached the goal at @xmath103 .    * state iii * : the whole school lies on the left of @xmath81 at @xmath103 .",
    "these states are illustrated respectively in figures [ 20fishschool ] , [ 5fishschool ] , [ 1fishschool ] . because we choose the parameter characterizing for the fish - fish interaction large enough ,",
    "once school is created it will keep still .",
    "so we can say the school reaches to the goal when distance from the center of school ( @xmath104 ) to the center of food resource @xmath105 does not exceed 0.04 .    in table",
    "[ bb2tab5 ] and figure [ bb2fig6 ] , we give our numerical result with parameter setting as above and different value of sensitivity coefficient @xmath106 .",
    ".advantage of fish schooling for foraging [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if the school reaches to the goal within allotted time period ( in our experiments , it is @xmath103 ) , that is it has * state i * , then we call it  success \" otherwise we say it  failure \" .",
    "we illustrate the percentage of successful case ( among simulation trials for each parameter set ) in figure [ bb2fig6 ] .        from the results we see that with all four values of @xmath106 under consideration , a single fish fails to find food resource .",
    "as the number of fish is larger , the probability of foraging success is positive . especially , when parameters are chosen appropriately then this probability seems to increases as the population of fish increases ( until some large @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath107 , the above remark holds true until @xmath108 .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "we let the fish take initial position in a small rectangle domain in the upper left side of the domain where the scent of food is very weak .",
    "so one fish senses the scent weakly .",
    "but if there are more fish at different positions , some fish can be at good positions to scent food better .",
    "they have tendency to move toward the food resource by moving along the scent s concentration gradient direction",
    ". then their neighbor fish , thanks to attractive force , will follow them .",
    "this results in the success of the whole school in finding food resource .",
    "another possible reason for this can be the total effect of food scent on a big group of fish is stronger than that on a smaller group . from this",
    "we can conclude that the school provides foraging advantage for its members .",
    "however , we can see in figure [ bb2fig6 ] that from some large value of school population the graph of success percentage trends to decrease .",
    "for example in the case @xmath109 , the percentage of success case is 100% with @xmath110 , then it decreases to 80% and 50% for @xmath111 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "while in the case @xmath112 , at @xmath111 , there are 8 successful case over 10 trials , but after that the probabilities for success are 0 for @xmath113 .",
    "this is also reasonable because besides the food resource attraction , the movement of school fish is affected also by obstacles .",
    "when the number of fish increases , the cohesiveness of school is high ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it will keep the school lying in on the left of the first obstacle or cause the school to spend a lot of time before reaching to the food resource .",
    "this suggests that for each parameter set which is chosen appropriately , there exist some optimal values of group population such that the school gets highest possibility in getting food . in our simulations ,",
    "such optimal values are @xmath114 for @xmath112 ; @xmath110 for @xmath109 ; @xmath115 for @xmath107 .    in numerical computation",
    "we used the euler explicit scheme for stochastic differential equations which has been introduced by kloeden - platen @xcite .",
    "this is the simplest method and requires the least computational cost among the ones for solving stochastic differential equations numerically .",
    "in general , this method has strong order 0.5 but because of the special structure of the model we consider in which the diffusion coefficients are constant , the order becomes 1 . from the above reasons , this method is a suitable choice for this study as there are plenty of numerical simulations need to be made .",
    "in this paper , we studied the foraging process of animals swarm in noisy environment with the presence of obstacles , from a mathematical point of view .",
    "we introduced the local rule ( e ) for foraging and wrote out it into a mathematical formula . thanks to this formula , we newly presented the sde model describing the process .",
    "our model describes the behavioral rules of individual animals precisely .",
    "moreover , it is tractable for mathematical treatments , especially doing numerical simulations .",
    "one can easily make new models by adding suitable external force .    as a consequence , we provided very interesting numerical examples , which verified the hypothesis that animals acquire foraging advantages by forming warm . in particular , we showed that when the number of fish in the school is large , the probability for foraging success is positive . especially , when the parameters in the model are chosen appropriately , this probability seems to increase as the population size of fish increases ( until the optimal value of the population ) .",
    "the existence of this optimal value can be explained by the cohesiveness of the school .",
    "the information obtained can be seen as guidelines for constructing new information system like ambient system .",
    "it seems that we have to consider complex systems whose constituents react each other with certain rules . such systems may not have a beforehand goal or the goal can even depend on the process . in one hand",
    "such systems have robustness , but in the other hand , they also have fragility .",
    "we would like to apply our research results on robustness and fragility of self - organizing biological systems to information systems .",
    "in addition , understanding the operating principle of natural swarm can also give guideline for intelligent design and control of vehicles @xcite .",
