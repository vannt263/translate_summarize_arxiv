    "note that the parabolic confinement represents an excellent approximation to the electrostatic potential from a gated structures@xcite .    at the same time , by changing the saddle point of the parabola , @xmath50 , and the confinement strength , @xmath51 , it is convenient to control both the electron density and the smoothness / steepness of the potential . self - consistent solution of eqs . ( [ eq : hamiltonian])-([eq : electrondensity ] ) can be spin degenerate and spin polarized ( left and right panels in fig .",

    "[ fig : figure1 ] , a small magnetic field was temporarily introduced to trigger spin degenerate solutions for some initial iterations .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4](c ) shows a representative spin - polarized electron density in an ideal infinite quantum wire .",
    "as the electron density decreases at the edge of the wire , it becomes spin polarized and exhibits a spatial spin polarization yielding a separation , @xmath52 , between the spin up / down densities .",
    "this is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] for a series of wire configurations . along the @xmath50-axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](a ) the width of the wire is held constant whereas the electron density grows as @xmath53 is increased ( we keep the fermi energy @xmath54 conversely , changing the width of the wire along the @xmath55-axis by decreasing the confinement strength , @xmath51 , and keeping @xmath50 constant , a more shallow wire is studied .",
    "the behavior of the spatial spin polarization presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](a ) shows that @xmath52 increases as the electron density is decreased and the confinement becomes smoother .",
    "note that this dependence of the @xmath52 as a function of the electron density and the confinement strength is consistent with the corresponding behavior of @xmath52 near the edges of a quantum wire in perpendicular magnetic field @xcite , where @xmath52 also increases as the electron density is decreased and the confinement becomes smoother .",
    "it should be noted that in the present case of zero magnetic field , @xmath52 shows a nonmonotonic dependence of the spin polarization and electron density / slope of confinement potential .",
    "this behavior of @xmath52 is a manifestation of the subband structure in a quantum wire of a finite width .",
    "for example , if there is some energy level close to @xmath56 the exchange interaction effectively splits it into spin - up and spin - down subbands , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](c),(f ) . as a result",
    ", the total charge density profile shows a spatial spin separation @xmath52 at the boundary of quantum wire ( left part of ( c ) in figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , a spin - degeneracy holds for energy levels far away from @xmath56 see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](b ) , ( d ) .    having established that an infinite quantum wire can have a spin - polarized solution , we conclude that this solution is triggered in the finite quantum wire as well , even though the electrons injected into the middle part of the wire are spin - degenerate ( we stress that we always select the spin - unpolarized solution in the leads ) .",
    "a word of caution is however in order concerning a reliability of the above predictions for the spatial spin separation near the wire edges obtained within the dft - lsda .",
    "our recent comparison of the dft - lsda and the hartree - fock ( hf ) approaches demonstrates that the two methods provide qualitatively ( and in most cases quantitatively ) similar results for electronic properties of ideal infinite quantum wires in the integer quantum  hall regime@xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the hf approach , the dft calculations predict much larger spatial spin separation near the wire edge for low magnetic fields ( when the compressible strips for spinless electrons are not formed yet ) . note that a comparative study of two methods can not distinguish which approach gives a correct result for @xmath52 for zero field .",
    "this question can be resolved by a comparison to the exact results obtained by e.g. quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "we thus can not exclude that the predicted spin polarization near the wire boundaries as @xmath57 can be an artifact of the dft - lsda , and we defer this question to further studies .",
    "let us now focus on the spin polarization in the central part of the wire .",
    "depending on the electron density , we can identify three regimes with qualitatively different behavior . in the first regime the spin polarization of the electron density @xmath58 and the spin polarization of the conductance @xmath59 are negligible ; for the 30 nm spacer sample this is roughly between @xmath60v@xmath61v ( row ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ) while for the 60 nm spacer sample this happens between @xmath62v@xmath61v . in this regime",
    "the decreasing gate voltage causes a decreasing conductance ( because of a reduction of the number of propagating subbands ) , but no significant spin polarization , except at the edges , occurs . the polarization at the edges is expected since the wire under consideration is wide ( @xmath47500 nm ) and shallow ( minimum potential @xmath63mev ) , which corresponds to the high polarization region of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4](a ) . the self - consistent potential , shown for a slice along the middle of the wire in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](a ) , ( b ) is well below the fermi energy , such that the characteristic potential fluctuations of the long - range impurity potential are much smaller than the average distance from the potential bottom to @xmath0 .",
    "as the gate voltage becomes more negative , the wire undergoes a spin polarization in the central part , see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](b ) , ( c ) . for the 30 nm spacer sample ( row ( b ) in figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) this occurs for the gate voltages @xmath64v and for the 60 nm sample , @xmath65v . the splitting results in the fragmentation of spin - up / down densities into spin - polarized islands in the wire seen in row ( b ) of figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the onset of spin polarization is displaced towards a lower gate voltage for the thicker spacer , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](b / c ) , but it is not clear whether there is any other qualitative difference between the two samples . to settle",
    "this would require further computations over more samples with varying spacer thickness and donor sheet configurations .",
    "however , because of the extensive computational efforts needed to find a convergent solution ( sometimes requiring up to 20000 iterations ) we were in position to study only two representative wires with spacers 30 nm and 60 nm .    finally we identify a third , non - conducting regime , corresponding to a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) ; @xmath66 v for the 30 nm spacer and @xmath67 v for the 60 nm spacer .",
    "conductance is pinched off and electrons are trapped in isolated pockets along the wire , fig .  [",
    "fig : figure3 ] ( c ) .",
    "this electron - droplet state has been analyzed thoroughly in @xcite . using arguments based on the screening of the impurity potential by the 2deg , efros _ _ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite gave an expression for the critical density , @xmath6 , where the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) occurs , @xmath68where @xmath69 is a numerical constant = 0.11 and @xmath9 the donor density .",
    "we use this expression to find the approximate point for the mit in our samples . for the 30 nm spacer eq .",
    "( [ eq : efros1993 ] ) yields @xmath70m@xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figure5 ] ( a ) ) and for the 60 nm spacer @xmath71m@xmath3 .",
    "the predictions for @xmath6 agree rather well with the numerical results that show that the wire undergoes a transition to a spin - polarized regime before the mit occurs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ) ( b ) , ( c ) . thus , close to the pinch - off regime , the dft - lsda predicts formation of the spin - polarized electron lakes trapped in the minima of the long - range impurity potential .",
    "such localized states might be relevant to the experimental observations of bird _ at al .",
    "_ that provide evidence of bound state - mediated resonance interaction between the coupled quantum point contacts close to the pinch - off regime@xcite . while microscopic origin on the effect is still under debate , our findings indicate that because the spin - polarized localized states trapped in minima of the impurity potential are generic feature of modulation - doped split - gate heterostructures , they might be relevant for the interpretation of the effect reported by bird _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "finally , a comment is in order concerning applicability of the method used . in our calculations we assume a constant chemical potential throughout the system .",
    "this condition is certainly violated in the regime close to the pinch off when the electrons are trapped in isolated lakes containing an integer number of charges ( i.e. in the coulomb blockade regime of electron transport ) .",
    "it is now well recognized that the standard dft - lsda is not expected to work in the coulomb blockade regime of weak coupling because of the spurious self - interaction errors caused by the lack of the derivative discontinuity of the exchange and correlation potentials in the standard dft@xcite .",
    "the validity of the present method is limited to the case of strong coupling when electron number in the structure is not quantized ( i.e. the coulomb charging is unimportant ) and the conductance of the systems exceeds the conductance unit @xmath72 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion and further references ) .",
    "because of the uncorrected self - interaction of the standard dft - lsda , the electron lakes in the pinch - off regime do not contain an integer electron number and the calculated conductance does not exhibit expected coulomb - blockade peaks .",
    "we thus conclude that while the present calculations qualitatively capture the onset of the pinch - off regime , a quantitative description of this regime ( accounting for the quantized electron number in the pockets as well reproducing the coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance ) would require methods that go beyond the standard dft - lsda scheme utilized in the present calculations .",

    "_ studied the evolution of the zero bias anomaly ( zba)@xcite in 2degs for low and zero magnetic fields .",
    "the behavior of the zba was associated with different spin states in the 2deg and measurements over different disorder configurations ( cool downs ) and temperatures indicated that the spin polarization observed is a generic effect for low density 2degs .",
    "the zba was most easily observed in a small disorder window between the metallic and insulating regime .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the window of high spin polarization we find above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](b)-(d ) ) .",
    "further experiments on the zba in 2degs@xcite suggested the formation of localized magnetic moments due to spin polarized regions in the 2deg as the electron density is lowered .",
    "this was understood as an effect of the potential due to background disorder which is similar to the impurity induced spin polarized droplets we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] ( third column ) .",
    "many of the observations in @xcite were strongest for electron densities around @xmath73m@xmath3 , a slightly lower electron density than we find . in our case",

    "both prus _ _ et al.__@xcite and shaskin _ _ et al.__@xcite find that the spin susceptibility is critically enhanced prior to the metal - insulator transition in the 2deg .",
    "it is , however , not clear from the experiment whether a spin polarized phase actually exists between the metal and insulating phase or if there is only an increased magnetization in the metallic phase .",
    "resonant inelastic light scattering measurements on gaas single wells showed direct evidence for spin polarization at low densities@xcite .",

    "we have studied spin - polarization of a 2deg in split - gate quantum wires formed in modulation - doped gaas heterostructures focusing on the effect of the long - range impurity potential originating from the remote donors .",
    "we find that depending on the electron density , the spin polarization exhibits qualitatively different features in three different regimes .",
