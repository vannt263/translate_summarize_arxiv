    "here we continue our previous research on the composition of positive linear operators and on linear operators in general , thus emphasizing the fact again that a functional - analytic point of view onto the problem is useful .",
    "our report is a continuation of @xcite and @xcite where related problems were considered .",
    "the present report is motivated by a discussion between the late alexandru lupa and the first author which took place in sibiu in late december 2006 .",
    "the topic of this discussion was the question if the classical bernstein operator @xmath3 @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 $ ] , can be decomposed into simpler positive building blocks .",
    "more precisely , the problem was if there are non - trivial positive linear operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that @xmath8 .",
    "we had some preliminary results then , and it was intended to eventually publish a joint paper dealing with this topic .",
    "this is mentioned in the obituary @xcite indicating one reason for the long delay in further investigating the problem .",
    "one of our candidates for the factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 were certain beta - type operators introduced by mhlbach in @xcite and further investigated by him in @xcite and by lupa in @xcite .",

    "* satz 2.28 ) , @xmath13 moreover , it is known from @xcite and @xcite that @xmath11 preserves monotonicity and ( ordinary ) convexity .    it is known that if one composes two positive linear operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , both reproducing linear functions , then for the second moment of the product operator one has @xmath14 here the superscript in @xmath15 indicates that the operator @xmath6 is applied to functions in the variable @xmath16 .",
    "putting @xmath17 the question then was if there is another positive linear operator @xmath7 such that @xmath18 and in particular , @xmath19 natural candidates for @xmath7 are operators of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 , @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 would become the bernstein operator if @xmath24 could be chosen in a way such that @xmath25 , \\ 0 \\leq k \\leq n.\\ ] ] the first ( unpublished ) attempt made used piecewise linear interpolation @xmath26 \\longrightarrow c[0,1 ] \\text { at }      0 , \\frac{1}{n } , \\dots ,   \\frac{k}{n } , \\dots , \\frac{n-1}{n } , 1\\ ] ] which can explicitely be described as @xmath27_{\\alpha }        f \\left ( \\frac{k}{n } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 = [ a , b , c ; f(\\alpha ) ] _ { \\alpha}$ ] denotes the divided difference of a function @xmath29 on the ( distinct knots ) @xmath30 , with respect to @xmath31 .",
