    "dark - matter halos that form hierarchically in simulations of @xmath1cdm cosmology have a number of regular properties : their mass density profiles , the distributions of velocity anisotropy , spin parameters , and substructure are largely independent of the halo s mass over a wide range of values .",
    "other properties , such as the concentration and triaxiality , vary systematically with halo mass @xcite .    the landmark work of ( * ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) reported that the halo mass density could be fitted with a broken power - law @xmath2 where the length scale , @xmath3 , is the radius around which the logarithmic slope changes .",
    "the steepness of the inner cusp reflected in the value of the exponent @xmath4 has been the subject of much debate @xcite .",
    "more recent work @xcite finds the einasto profile ( described in  4 ) with its steep but finite central density to be a better fit .    virialized halos that have undergone multiple mergers acquire a triaxial shape in general , though with a strong bias towards prolateness @xcite . to accommodate triaxiality when fitting the mass density , a number of authors ( *",

    "* hereafter js02 ) replace the radial coordinate @xmath5 with the dimensionless coordinate @xmath6 defined through @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the lengths of the major , intermediate , and minor axes , respectively .",
    "although axial ratios and alignments display some radial variation ( js02 ; * ? ?",

    "* hereafter sfc12 ) , we focus here on creating self - similar ellipsoids for which these values remain in a fixed ratio , with the axes aligned , at all radii .",
    "this idealized geometry reduces the mass density to a function of a single variable @xmath11 ( eq .  [ homoeoidal surface ] ) , with the axis ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 as constant parameters .",
    "self - similarity is an attractive assumption , but it is generally insufficient to enable a derivation of a distribution function ( df ) .",
    "the df can be expressed in terms of the actions @xcite , but these are known only in the case of the `` perfect '' ellipsoid for which the potential is fully separable in ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite and all orbits are regular .",
    "regular orbits also exist in more general ellipsoids but irregular orbits , for which the only isolating integral is the energy , populate some parts of phase space , and may even dominate @xcite .",
    "various approaches have been adopted to construct @xmath0-body models of triaxial mass distributions with some success .",
    "@xcite and @xcite `` squeeze '' a spherical model , @xcite developed an iterative method that corrects the density after each time step , without revising the velocities , until equlibrium is attained , while @xcite construct them through multiple collisions of separate systems .",
    "however , neither the squeeze nor collision methods provide a systematic means for reproducing a specific geometry , such as self - similarity , while only halos with a central core , rather than a steep inner density gradient , have been attempted with the iterative method .",
    "@xcite built triaxial models from linear combinations of bound orbits in the desired potential . in his method , orbits are drawn from a pre - calculated library that approximately spans the phase - space of the bound system and contains the time - averaged contributions to the mass density in a set of spatial cells .",
    "the assignment of orbital weights is constrained by the targeted mass density in these cells , but since the assignment is far from unique , it is customary to seek an optimal solution , such as by maximizing the entropy @xcite to favor a smooth distribution .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to cuspy , triaxial systems @xcite",
    ". however , creation of @xmath0-body models requires the further , non - trivial step of selecting particles from appropriately chosen points along the orbits selected from the library .",
    "here we adopt the `` made to measure '' ( hereafter m2 m ) algorithm proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter st96 ) , which is similar in spirit to schwarzschild s but adjusts the mass of each moving particle dynamically .",
    "the algorithm has been further developed by ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter d09 ) , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and a useful brief review is given by @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of m2 m is that , on completion , the equilibrium @xmath0-body system is ready to use with no additional step .",
    "the range of applications of m2 m @xcite is a fair measure of its versatility .",
    "one can add observational constraints to both m2 m ( dl07 ) and schwarzschild s method ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) in order to construct models for comparison with data , which is probably the most widely used application of these methods .",
    "but our objective in this paper is purely theoretical .",
    "our aim is to use m2 m to construct @xmath0-body realizations of self - similar ellipsoidal halos with a mass density and eccentricity suggested by cosmological simulations .",
    "while an improvement on spherical halos , our models are still idealizations , since cosmological halos are generally not self - similar , and we also neglect rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , certain kinematic features @xcite and substructure @xcite .",
    "some triaxial models have already been created by this technique , notably in dl07 and d09 , but there are minor differences in our approach and we present more extensive tests of the stability of the resulting models . we will use them in later work to study the influence of halo triaxiality on the dynamics of embedded disks .",
    "the m2 m method has already been described elsewhere ( e.g. , st96 , dl07 , d09 ) .",
    "we therefore give only an outline , noting where our treatment differs from previous work .",
    "our presentation follows closely that given by dl07 , but we do not require their generalization to include constraints from velocity data .",
    "we seek to create equilibrium halo models with a target density distribution @xmath14 and total mass @xmath15 in the gravitational potential @xmath16 . in most applications ,",
    "the potential arises from the density @xmath17 only , but it is also possible to consider models with additional mass components , such as a disk or central mass , that contribute to @xmath18 but not to @xmath17 .",
    "first we divide the volume of the target model into a set of @xmath19 cells , each having a volume @xmath20 , and define a set of occupancy kernels @xmath21 @xmath22 the mass in the @xmath23th cell is therefore given by @xmath24    suppose that we were to construct a trial set of particles ( e.g. , as described in  [ initialization ] ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a 6d phase space coordinate .",

    "the @xmath43 and @xmath60 functions have noisy paths owing to @xmath0-body sampling noise and the movement of particles across cells , which causes abrupt changes to the values of @xmath61 .",

    "this adjustment has been integral to implementations of m2 m reported in the literature .",
    "d09 points out , however , that this procedure is inconsistent with the extremum condition ( [ kuhn - tucker ] ) and compromises the meaning of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ chi - squared statistic ] ) since the @xmath47 reflect the original @xmath0-body shot noise , not the reduced noise .",
    "instead , d09 applies a moving average to @xmath59 , and , in combination with eq .",
    "( [ foce ] ) , obtains a second order ode for @xmath68 .",
    "however , the following argument suggests that such attempts at explicit averaging are redundant .",
    "formally , the foce may be integrated to give @xmath69 where @xmath70 thus we see that @xmath71 is proportional to the time average @xmath72 .",
    "substitution of eq .",
    "( [ extremum condition ] ) for the integrand in ( [ evolution operator ] ) shows that the behavior of @xmath71 is dominated by orbital averages of the form @xmath73 .",
    "but @xmath61 is influenced by the trajectory of the @xmath74th particle only , while @xmath62 is determined by all particles in the @xmath23th cell .",
    "if the number of such particles is sufficiently large , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath75 decouples at large times into the product of two independent averages @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ orbital average ] ) .",
    "furthermore , st96 and dl07 prove that @xmath78 at large times which , from the definition of @xmath62 , implies @xmath79 .",
    "thus we effectively recover eq .",
    "( [ schwarzschild condition ] ) and thereby formally establish the asymptotic equivalence of the m2 m and schwarzschild s methods .",
    "therefore , not only is explicit averaging redundant but the application of eq .",
    "( [ ode for averaged deltas ] ) is counterproductive if @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "we have not explored how large @xmath0 needs to be for this statement to be true , but when we employ @xmath80 particles , we find that inclusion of the averaging procedure ( [ ode for averaged deltas ] ) degrades the actual value of @xmath67 by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore refrain from including any additional averaging .",
    "thus we find a deeper resemblance between the m2 m approach and schwarzschild s method . however , there are two reasons for preferring m2 m : not only does eq .",
    "( [ extremum condition ] ) combine averaging and solving for @xmath81 into a single algorithm instead of two distinct steps but , upon convergence , it also delivers a representative set of particle coordinates that are in equilibrium , in readiness for an @xmath0-body simulation .      fluctuations in the values of the @xmath43 as the system evolves jointly with the foce imply that satisfying condition ( [ kuhn - tucker ] ) for all @xmath0 particles simultaneously at any given instance is implausible . instead",
    ", an equally effective , yet more realistic , goal of the m2 m method is to ensure that @xmath82 , for some prescribed threshold @xmath83 .    by linearizing the foce ( exclusive of the entropy term ) , st96 ( see also dl07 ) obtained a set of equations for the modes of the @xmath84 and demonstrated that these modes decay exponentially  a result that essentially formalizes the intuition behind the intent of the foce .",
    "though it does not provide practical guidelines for assessing convergence , it does , however , render the @xmath84 , rather than the @xmath43 , as the focus of the convergence analysis .",
    "the threshold , @xmath83 , may be made as small as desired by reducing @xmath85 , with the disadvantage that an increasing number of particle weights are driven toward zero .",
    "reaching a desired threshold @xmath83 is not necessarily indicative of convergence ; only when changes in the entropy become small relative to its level can the algorithm be said to have reached convergent conditions .",
    "ultimately , the true test of the algorithm s convergence is whether the resulting system maintains the desired shape and mass profile as it evolves freely and _ self - consistently _ without intervention from the foce ( see  [ sec.stability ] ) .",
    "our implementation of the algorithm , which will be discussed in greater detail later , may be conveniently summarized as follows ( see also d09 ) :    1 .",
    "_ initialization _ : construct an equibrium , spherically symmetric model with the desired mass density profile consisting of @xmath86 particles .",
    "transform the particle coordinates by rescaling ( see eq .",
    "[ scale transformation ] below ) to achieve the targeted geometry and adjust the velocities so that the tensor virial theorem is satisfied .",
    "2 .   _ relaxation _ : allow the system to settle ( without the foce ) for 20  25 dynamical times .",
    "m2 m step _ : evolve the system while adjusting the weights in accordance to the foce .",
    "convergence check _ : once the entropy level is nearly constant , switch off the foce and allow the system to evolve self - consistently to test whether it is in equilibrium .",
    "5 .   _ stability check _ : apply an adiabatic , aspherical perturbation to seed any possible secular instabilities and follow the subsequent self - consistent evolution .",
    "note that we obtain a smooth target potential @xmath18 and the values of @xmath47 needed for steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) by creating a model having many more particles than is practical to evolve , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "their positions , with velocities ignored , give a smoother representation of @xmath17 , and we can solve for their gravitational field using our adopted @xmath0-body method .",
    "it is possible to run m2 m using a self - consistent , rather than a rigid , potential .",
    "this is less satisfactory , however , because m2 m continuously tries to adjust weights to compensate for ( mild ) particle scattering .",
    "we therefore prefer to use a smooth and frozen target potential .",
    "the target triaxial halos in this work consist of a series of concentric and co - eccentric , nested ellipsoidal shells - a simplifying idealization . surfaces of constant density in a self - similar ellipsiod have constant @xmath88 , where @xmath89 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the semi - axes of the outer surface of the finite ellipsoid .",
    "we also define the eccentricities , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for later use .",
    "strongly triaxial systems have values of the triaxiality parameter , @xmath92 , while @xmath93 for an oblate , and @xmath94 for a prolate , spheroid .",
    "we wish to construct self - similar ellipsiods for which the density profile @xmath95 has the same functional form ( to within a normalization factor to preserve the same total mass ) as some spherical model @xmath96 .",
    "we relate a point @xmath97 on a sphere to @xmath98 on the ellipsoidal surface through @xmath99 which is equivalent to the scale transformation @xmath100 two ellipsoidal surfaces at @xmath88 and @xmath101 bound a volume known as a _ thin homoeoid _",

    "the volume of a thin homoeoid is @xmath102 , with @xmath103 , while that of a spherical shell is @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , if a sphere of radius @xmath8 and density @xmath96 is compressed along the intermediate and minor axes by factors @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively in such a way that equidensity shells do not cross , it yields a self - similar ellipsoid of equal mass with density @xmath105 .      particle - mesh , or grid , methods remain the most efficient for @xmath0-body simulations of an isolated gravitating system @xcite . here",
    "we use a radial grid that computes forces from an expansion in surface harmonics on a set of spherical shells that are more closely spaced near the center .",

    "individual particle masses are divided between neighboring grid points according to the cloud - in - cell procedure , which also distinguishes between mass interior and exterior to a field point .",
    "the particles are smeared in angle because the expansion ( [ harmonic expansion ] ) is limited by the adopted @xmath115 .",
    "the end result may be pictured as each point particle being replaced by a smeared density distribution wedged between neighboring spherical radial shells .",
    "see @xcite or http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/@xmath116sellwood/manual.pdf for a full description .",
    "a particle within the @xmath23th radial shell , which spans the range @xmath117 , contributes to @xmath118 real terms @xmath119 . if we were to use the gravity grid shells to define the cells in eq .",
    "( [ cell - occupation kernel ] ) as in dl07 , then @xmath120 radial nodes would yield a total of @xmath121 separate kernel moments @xmath122 ( eq .",
    "[ harmonic kernel ] ) ; note that each particle contributes to a single radial shell @xmath23 and to multiple @xmath123 components .",
    "since @xmath124 typically ranges in the hundreds , we superimpose a coarser grid  the m2 m grid  consisting of @xmath125 nodes , where all nodes in the m2 m grid coincide with nodes of the finer gravity grid .",
    "coarser radial spacing not only reduces the particle shot noise in each bin but also improves the efficiency in solving the foce by reducing the number of kernel moments to be computed .",
    "it may seem that one of these grids is superfluous , for if the resolution of the m2 m grid is adequate to resolve the mass density , then it should be adquate to resolve the gravitational forces . however , as argued above , the foce averages over a large number of particle trajectories making coarser m2 m binning acceptable , while the finer gravity - grid is needed to resolve forces and determine accurate particle trajectories .      even though they are less closely spaced than the gravity nodes , the m2 m grid spacings should still be small , especially in the inner half of the halo , in order to represent the targeted shape .",
    "but with equal mass particles , fine binning causes larger statistical fluctuations in the cell occupancy .",
    "we therefore employ particles that are less massive near the center and have gradually increasing masses towards the outer edge . to achieve this , we use the dimensionless function @xmath126 to weight the _ initial _ particle masses . here , @xmath127 is the specific angular momentum ( in our dimensionless units , see  [ sec.units ] ) and @xmath128 a convenient constant .",
    "to maintain the desired initial density , we select particles from the df weighted by @xmath129 to ensure that lighter particles are proportionately more numerous @xcite .",

    "we apply the weighting scheme described in  [ particle resolution ] and select @xmath86 particles in the usual way @xcite .",

    "we also follow dl07 and d09 by interpreting the dispersions as sampling error consistent with shot noise inherent in any @xmath0-body representation , but construct our target potential from a static @xmath0-body model with a very large number of particles , which we use not only to compute the target potential , but also to determine the mean and dispersions that serve as proxies for @xmath187 and @xmath188 , respectively , in eq .",

    "the full procedure consists of several distinct steps : after initializing the particles as described in  [ initialization ] , we allow the model to relax in the smooth target potential for 25 dynamical times .",
    "we then apply the foce over 200 dynamical times , a sufficient time span to ensure that changes in the entropy level are minimal .",
    "our adpoted model is the einasto halo and we present three aspherical models that bear strong similarities to halos from the millenium - ii simulation selected by @xcite .",
    "we demostrate that they are stable by evolving them in their self - consistent potential over a period of 100 dynamical times , during which their properties barely changed .",
    "we also tested non - linear stability by perturbing the model and showed that its shape was restored quite well after the perturbation was removed .",
    "in additional experiments , not presented here , we have found that singular mass profiles , such as the nfw or hernquist , present no difficulty , and higher eccentricities can also be achieved , with the proviso that @xmath189 may need to be increased , which would lengthen computation times .",
    "we thank the referee for a careful read of the manuscript . this work was supported by nsf grant ast/1108977 ."
