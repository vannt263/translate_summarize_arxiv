    ". we will discuss this important issue later in the case of critical spin chains .",
    "now if we consider that the outcome of the measurement leads us to a boundary cft , then based on the cardy - calabrese argument @xcite the calculation of the entanglement entropy @xmath27 should boil down to the calculation of the one point correlation function of twist operator sitting on the border between @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the cylinder . in other words",
    "we have : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the twist operator with conformal weight @xmath31 and @xmath4 is the central charge .",

    "notice that in the above formula @xmath22 can not go to zero because cylinder with a slit is topologically different from cylinder . to get the result for before measurement case one can simply put @xmath40 which is the smallest scale in the system ,",

    "looking to the jordan - wigner transformation it is easy to see that any measurement in the @xmath16 basis on particular site can be translated to the measuring the number of fermions in that site . in other words",
    "if one measures the @xmath16 in all the sites of a subsystem with size @xmath22 the outcome will be one of @xmath83 possible configurations which can be easily translated to the configurations made of presence or absence of fermions in the sites of the subsystem .",
    "for simplicity we first consider that the outcome of the measurement is a string of @xmath22 fermion occupied sites .",
    "this can be calculated easily by using grassmann numbers by first calculating the reduced density matrix for a sub - system with length @xmath84 and then finding the reduced density matrix of the subsystem with length @xmath2 with the assumption that the outcome of the measurement in the subsystem @xmath22 is a string of filled sites .",
    "the method is explained with full detail in the appendix .",
    "the results for different filling factors are shown in the figure  3 .",
    "there are some comments in order : first of all because of the @xmath85 symmetry of the xx model the number of particles in the system is conserved and for this reason as far as @xmath86 is small it is very difficult to have a string of sites with fermions . in other words for example in the xx model with @xmath87",
    "the most probable outcome is an antiferromagnetic string rather than ferromagnetic string . in @xcite",
    "it is already conjectured that for the half filling case most probably the ferromagnetic configuration is not going to lead to a boundary conformal field theory and so the very first assumption that we used is going to fail . despite this argument we found surprisingly that for @xmath88 the formula ( [ sb for pbc ] ) works perfectly .",
    "one can also check the results for those cases that the outcome of the measurement is antiferromagnetic string .",
    "it is expected that this case leads to dirichlet boundary condition in the bosonization language and so it is related the boundary cft .",
    "the results presented in the figure  4 indeed show that the formula ( [ sb for pbc ] ) works perfectly also in this case .",
    "since the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations are at the two extreme sides of the all possible configurations based on the above numerical results one can conjecture that independent of the outcome of the measurement in the @xmath16 basis the formula ( [ sb for pbc ] ) will work if the @xmath2 is bigger enough than @xmath22 .",
    "note that since the number of configurations increases exponentially this conjecture is beyond what we can check numerically .",
    "one can also do all the cft calculations in the case of open boundary condition , the only difference is that now we have a strip with a slit instead of a cylinder .",
    "one can simply map a strip with a slit to upper half plane by using the map @xmath89 .",
    "after some algebra we have @xmath90 the limit @xmath91 simply gives us the well - known formula @xmath92 , see @xcite .",
    "we have checked the validity of this formula in the case of short - range harmonic oscillators using the same method that we hired for the periodic bc .",
    "the results shown in figure  5 are fairly compatible with the formula ( [ sb for obc ] ) .",
    "we noticed that although the log formula is perfectly compatible there is almost 8 percent deviation from central charge that might be due to finite size effects .",

    "exact formulas were derived for bipartite entanglement entropy after ",
    "conformal measurements  in the case of periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "the formulas were checked in explicit examples of free bosonic system and xx model in a magnetic field .",
    "we noticed that since bosonization of xxz model in the @xmath16 basis leads to free bosonic system the antiferromagnetic outcome of the measurement in this basis should be compatible with the results of free bosonic system @xcite . in the case of xx model in a magnetic field we showed that if we do our measurements in the @xmath16 basis independent of having ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic outcome for our measurements the bipartite entanglement entropy in particular regimes can be described with cft formulas .",
    "we also derived a lower bound for the localizable entanglement in the case of harmonic oscillators .",

    "we first discuss how the method works for a string of empty sites .",
    "a string of empty sites means that in the equation ( [ matrix elements1 ] ) we need to put all the @xmath100 s with @xmath109 inside the measuring subsystem equal to zero .",

    "<S> in particular , since numerical calculation of the entanglement entropy by using the techniques of dmrg in one dimension is now a well - known method @xcite one can easily study the critical and non - critical properties of the quantum systems in one dimension by studying the entanglement entropy . </S>",
