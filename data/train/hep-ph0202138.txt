    "<S> in crystalline color superconductivity , quark pairs form at non - zero total momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this crystalline order potentially enlarges the domain of color superconductivity in cold dense quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we present a perturbative calculation of the parameters governing the crystalline phase and show that this is indeed the case . nevertheless , the enhancement is modest , and to lowest order is independent of the strength of the color interaction </S>",
    "<S> .    2    while quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has now been firmly established as the theory of strong interactions , many important questions , such as the nature of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , still remain . attempts to address such issues have led to recent interest in exploring the nature of nuclear matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density . </S>",
    "<S> new phases of nuclear matter have long been sought after , both theoretically and experimentally . under the right conditions , </S>",
    "<S> nuclear matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma . at cold temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> however , recent application of qcd suggests a much richer phase structure of quark matter than originally anticipated . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most prominent of such phases , and one which may play an important rle in the core of neutron stars , is that of color superconductivity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> color superconductivity is essentially the quark analog of bcs superconductivity . because of attractive quark - quark interactions in qcd , the fermi sphere of quarks becomes unstable against the formation of cooper pairs and the system becomes superconducting at sufficiently low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative results may be obtained at ultra - high baryon densities where asymptotic freedom ensures the validity of the weak coupling approximation . in this regime , the main contribution arises from one - gluon exchange in the color antisymmetric channel . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting transition temperature , @xmath0 , is given in terms of the running qcd coupling @xmath1 by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the chemical potential and @xmath4 is the euler constant .    </S>",
    "<S> this result that @xmath5 is remarkable for its non - bcs behavior ( where bcs theory instead predicts @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath0 and the zero temperature gap energy @xmath7 , on the other hand , remains bcs - like : @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this non - bcs scaling is driven by the poor screening of the long range color magnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the same mechanism is also responsible for non - fermi liquid behavior which suppresses @xmath0 significantly @xcite .    since the main attractive channel is between different species of quarks , search for a realistic color superconductivity phase must take into consideration the masses of the light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , not accounted for in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvirus ] ) , is especially important when considering the color flavor - locked state @xcite involving @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> although not strictly identical , this situation is well modeled by separating the fermi surfaces of massless quarks that participate in the pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this case was recently investigated in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it was shown that a new crystalline superconductivity state may arise for an appropriate window of separation between fermi surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> crystalline superconductivity was originally investigated in bcs theory , where ferromagnetic impurities separate the fermi surfaces of each electron spin @xcite , so that @xmath12 . when the system is cooled from the normal phase , </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature is the maximum pairing temperature , allowing for a possible net momentum @xmath13 for a pair . for a sufficiently small separation , @xmath14 , zero momentum pairing wins . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 , pairing with non - zero momentum is favored . </S>",
    "<S> the net momentum provides a region of phase space where both quarks may sit on their respective fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however it breaks rotational invariance and leads to crystalline order . </S>",
    "<S> this state is also known as the loff state , after the work of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for @xmath17 , the transition temperature drops to zero , and superconductivity is lost .    in the bcs case , </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as the pair momentum @xmath20 ( at @xmath21 ) are proportional to the initial ( _ i.e. _  @xmath22 ) zero temperature gap energy , with the constants of proportionality being independent of the details of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath23 , while @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> as this indicates , the window for bcs crystalline superconductivity is fairly narrow .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the crystalline superconductivity state for color superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> our approach follows the perturbative method developed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which allows a systematic approach to determining @xmath0 ( but not directly the zero - temperature gap ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for color superconductivity , while @xmath18 remains unchanged , @xmath25 is modestly enhanced , so that there is a widening of the region of crystalline order compared to the bcs case . as in the behavior of @xmath0 itself in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvirus ] ) , the resulting non - bcs behavior of the color loff state also traces its origin to the long range nature of the magnetic gluons .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with a brief review of the perturbative method developed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a normal - phase determination of the transition temperature , however now applied to pairing with total momentum @xmath13 and shifted chemical potentials @xmath26 . the proper vertex function for quark pair scattering in the color antisymmetric channel is given by a dyson - schwinger equation @xmath27 where the initial and final momenta are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 stands for euclidean four - momentum , @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the matsubara energy , and the four - momentum of the pair is @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvioc ] ) is of the fredholm type with kernel @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the two quark irreducible part of the vertex and @xmath36 the full quark propagator with chemical potential @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the pairing instability may be probed by examining the spectrum of the kernel , given by the eigenvalue equation @xmath37 for eigenfunctions @xmath38 . at weak coupling , </S>",
    "<S> all eigenvalues are less than one for sufficiently high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> then , as the temperature is lowered , a point is reached where the largest eigenvalue reaches unity , @xmath39 , and the solution to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvioc ] ) becomes singular , corresponding to the onset of the pairing instability .    </S>",
    "<S> we have indicated explicitly the dependence of @xmath40 on the temperature , mean chemical potential , fermi surface separation and the pair momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath41 may thus be solved to obtain a pairing temperature as a function of @xmath42 for given @xmath3 and @xmath15 ; this provides a determination of @xmath43 when maximized over @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> ordinary and crystalline order corresponds to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , at this maximum point . at weak coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant @xmath15 and @xmath42 are both much smaller than the mean chemical potential @xmath3 , and the onset of loff order can be treated as a perturbation from ordinary pairing at @xmath46 . thus we look for an expansion of the eigenvalue @xmath40 in ascending powers of @xmath47 ( with coefficients that may depend on @xmath48 ) . through eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvirus ] ) , this is equivalent to an expansion in descending powers of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the @xmath22 value . </S>",
    "<S> quantities such as @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are much smaller than any finite power of @xmath47 and can be neglected .    to the accuracy of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvirus ] ) , the contribution of antiparticles to the scattering amplitude can be ignored and the two quark irreducible part of the vertex @xmath35 is well approximated by single gluon exchange : @xmath54 , \\label{eqacioz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 and @xmath58 are kinematic factors and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are magnetic and electric gluon propagators with hard dense loop ( hdl ) resummation . while the one - loop quark self energy contributes to the prefactor of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvirus ] ) , it will not interfere with the perturbative contribution of nonzero @xmath15 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we replace @xmath61 with the free quark propagator , @xmath62 , throughout .    the eigenvalue problem , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqzouros ] ) , was previously analyzed within each angular momentum channel for @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the highest eigenvalue with angular momentum @xmath63 reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a rescaled chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eigenfunction is @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are spherical harmonics . since the level spacing for different @xmath63 is of the same order as the perturbation to be introduced , a degenerate perturbation method has to be employed .    </S>",
    "<S> nonzero @xmath15 and @xmath42 modify the pole structure of the quark pair propagator of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvuron ] ) in a similar manner as in the bcs case . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a nonzero @xmath15 will shift the debye mass in the hdl resummed denominators of the vertex , and the numerators of the one - gluon vertex , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , depends on the total momentum @xmath71 . both corrections to the vertex function </S>",
    "<S> are of the order of @xmath72 or @xmath73 and may be ignored .    to diagonalize the kernel , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvuron ] ) , with nonzero @xmath15 and @xmath42 to @xmath74 , we evaluate @xmath75 between the @xmath76 eigenfunction @xmath77 and its adjoint @xmath78 and define @xmath79 using the eigenvalue equation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqzouros ] ) , for @xmath46 and to leading order in @xmath47 , we find @xmath80 the operator @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 , with @xmath83 diagonal in the angular momentum representation , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 diagonal in the coordinate ( angle ) representation , @xmath86 where @xmath87 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 is the polar angle with respect to momentum @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal quantum number @xmath89 remains conserved . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath83 and @xmath85 are hermitian and @xmath83 is non - positive . for @xmath44 , the rotation symmetry is intact and the largest eigenvalue of @xmath81 still corresponds to @xmath90 . </S>",

    "<S> what follows , we shall focus on the component @xmath93 since the additional sign change introduced by nonzero @xmath89 will not be the most favorable . on returning to a coordinate representation , @xmath94 , the eigenvalue equation for @xmath81 becomes @xmath95 where the first term on the left hand side is the coordinate representation of @xmath83 , following from the integral representation of @xmath96 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqtricky ] ) .    to explore the upper threshold of the loff window , @xmath19 , we take the limit @xmath97 , whereupon the function @xmath98 reduces to @xmath99 with @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the only possibility for obtaining a diverging @xmath19 is to take full advantage of the logarithmic singularity of @xmath85 as @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> consider , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , a trial function @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 , we find @xmath104 but @xmath105 , so that @xmath106 . therefore the operator @xmath81 is bounded from above , and the widening of the loff window can not grow indefinitely . </S>",
    "<S> a numerical analysis reveals that the largest eigenvalue of the integral equation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqint ] ) , with the limiting @xmath85 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqlimv ] ) for a fixed @xmath15 is @xmath107 , which occurs at @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath109 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , demonstrating the peak at @xmath110 . for a second order phase transition </S>",
    "<S> , the eigenvalue equation coincides with the limit of the gap equation as @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> an anisotropy will develop for the order parameter in the superphase as well . applying the pairing condition , @xmath112 , and the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath113 to be compared with the bcs case , @xmath114 .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the onset , @xmath115 , is numerically more tedious , but an upper bound can be readily obtained . </S>",
    "<S> for very small @xmath15 , we have @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term is too small to mix different @xmath63 , and we have @xmath90 for pairing . since @xmath117 at @xmath44 , the loff state is not favored . </S>",
    "<S> then if we assume the onset of the loff state starts from @xmath118 for sufficiently large @xmath15 , the critical value of @xmath15 follows from the condition @xmath119 . applying eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqtzwrtzopou ] ) and the pairing condition @xmath112 , we obtain @xmath120 which is identical to the bcs result . </S>",
    "<S> although we have not been able to verify it analytically , numerical results indicate that pairing indeed starts at @xmath44 . the numerically computed phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggested that there would be an indefinite widening of the window for the color loff state by drawing an analog with a @xmath121 dimensional system on account of the forward singularity of the scattering vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the present results , however , demonstrate that while the window is indeed widened over that of the bcs case , the widening is fairly modest , as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result may be understood since the reduction of the available phase space for pairing with increasing @xmath15 in higher dimensions dominates over any enhancement arising from a @xmath121 dimensional analog . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , unlike the isotropic bcs case , different angular momenta have to be considered simultaneously towards a determination of @xmath19 , and the long range order parameter itself would not be spherical . to our knowledge , such a mixing effect is entirely new and the approximations we have used are well controlled .    </S>",
    "<S> this angular momentum mixing in the color loff order is quite unique to the dynamically screened magnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> on writing the highest eigenvalue of the kernel , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqvuron ] ) , with angular momentum @xmath63 , @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 for all @xmath63 here . on the other hand , for a bcs model with a pointlike interaction , pairing only occurs in the @xmath11-wave channel , and @xmath124 . even for a yukawa type of interaction , </S>",
    "<S> say the screened electric interaction alone , @xmath125 would be different for different @xmath63 . in both the pointlike and yukawa cases </S>",
    "<S> , the angular momentum only mixes in higher order corrections , and would not lead to the enhancement seen in the color loff state . </S>"
