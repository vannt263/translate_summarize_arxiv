    "exotic atoms have a long history , and have stimulated interesting developments in quantum dynamics of systems involving both long - range and short - range forces . for the exploratory studies presented here , the refinements of effective theories  @xcite are not required , and we shall restrict ourselves to the schrdinger framework , as reviewed , e.g. , in  @xcite for the three - dimensional case , and extended in @xcite for the two - dimensional one .    in units simplifying the treatment of the pure coulomb case , an exotic atom can be modeled as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inter - particle distance and @xmath2 the short - range correction , with a variable strength for the ease of the discussion .",
    "when the above spectral problem is solved , the most striking observations are :    1 .",
    "the energy shift @xmath3 , as compared to the pure - coulomb energies @xmath4 , is often rather small , but is usually not given by ordinary perturbation theory : for instance , an infinite hard - core of small radius corresponds to a small energy shift but to an infinite first order correction .    2 .",
    "each energy @xmath5 , as a function of the strength parameter @xmath6 , is almost flat in a wide interval of @xmath6 , with a value close to some @xmath7 , one of the pure coulomb energies .",
    "then @xmath8 is well approached by a formula by deser et al . , and trueman  @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scattering length in the short - range interaction @xmath2 alone .    3 .",
    "if @xmath11 is attractive , when the strength @xmath6 approaches one of the positive critical values at which a first or a new bound state appears in the spectrum of @xmath12 alone , the energy @xmath5 quits its plateau and drops dramatically from the region of atomic energies to the one of deep nuclear energy .",
    "it is rapidly replaced in the plateau by the next level .",
    "this is known as _ level rearrangement _  @xcite .",
    "the above patterns are more general , and hold for for any combination of a long - range and a short - range interaction , say @xmath13 .",
    "the deser - trueman formula is generalized as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the normalized wave - function in the external potential  @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath16 supports only one bound state , then the rearrangement `` extracts '' states from the continuum , instead of shifting bound radial excitations . an illustration is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rearr2bs ] , with a superposition of two exponential potentials of range parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , namely @xmath19 where @xmath20 is tuned to start binding at unit strength , for a reduced mass @xmath21 .",

    "the dashed line indicates the approximation corresponding to the deser - trueman formula  .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show the coupling thresholds for the short - range part of the interaction . ]",
    "there are several possible improvements and alternative formulations of .",
    "for instance , @xmath10 , the bare scattering length in @xmath2 can be replaced by the `` long - range corrected '' scattering length where the solutions of the radial equation for @xmath2 are matched to the eigenfunction of the external potential .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , and refs .  there . in the physics of cold atoms ,",
    "one is more familiar with the approach by busch et al .",
    "it deals with the case of an harmonic oscillator modified at short distances , but the derivation can be generalized as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 the @xmath23-wave reduced radial wavefunction for @xmath24 that is regular at large @xmath1 , at energy @xmath25 , with some normalization , e.g. , @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the levels in @xmath16 correspond to the quantization condition @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an eigenenergy of @xmath16 , for instance the ground state .",
    "when a point - like interaction of scattering length @xmath10 is added , then the boundary condition is modified into @xmath30 which can be expanded near @xmath29 to give @xmath31 now , the equivalence of and , rewritten as , where @xmath32 is the normalized version of @xmath33 , comes from the relation @xmath34 which is easily derived from the wronskian identity , widely used in some textbooks @xcite , here applied to energies @xmath35 and @xmath29 .",
    "the generalization to a number of dimension @xmath36 is straightforward for @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the first plateau is avoided , as the short - range potential , if attractive , develops its own discrete spectrum for any @xmath39 .",
    "the case of @xmath40 is more delicate : see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to present a first investigation of the three - body analog of exotic atoms .",
    "we consider three identical bosons , though we have in mind some less simple systems for future work .",
    "we address the following questions : is there a pattern similar to the level rearrangement ?",
    "is there a generalization of the deser - trueman formula ?",
    "what are the similarities with the case where the long - range interaction is replaced by an overall harmonic confinement ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : three - body ] , we give some basic reminders about the spectrum of a three - boson systems from the borromean limit of a single bound state to the regime of stronger binding , with a word about the numerical techniques the results corresponding to a superposition @xmath41 are displayed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "an interpretation is attempted in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] , with the a three - body version of the deser - trueman formula .",
    "section  [ sec : outlook ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "if two bosons interact through an attractive potential , or a potential with attractive parts , @xmath42 , a minimal strength is required to achieve binding , say @xmath43 .",
    "a collection of values of @xmath44 can be found , e.g. , in the classic paper by blatt and jackson @xcite . in the following",
    ", we shall normalize @xmath45 so that @xmath46 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath47 is attractive everywhere , once two bosons are bound , the @xmath48-boson system is also bound .",
    "( the case of potentials with a strong inner repulsion would require a more detailed analysis which is beyond the scope of this preliminary investigation . )",
    "this means that for a single monotonic potential @xmath49~,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , the minimal coupling to achieve three - body binding , @xmath51 , is less than 1 , in our units .",
    "this is implicit in the seminal paper by thomas @xcite .",
    "the inequality @xmath52 is now referred to as `` borromean binding '' , after the study of neutron halos in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "one gets typically @xmath53 , i.e. , about 20% of borromean window  @xcite .    in short , the three - boson spectrum has the following patterns :    * for @xmath54 , no binding * for @xmath55 , a single borromean bound state , and , for @xmath6 close to 1 , a second three - body bound state just below the two - body energy , * for @xmath56 , two bound states below the @xmath57 break - up . * in addtion ,",
    "very near @xmath58 , the very weakly bound efimov states .",
    "the excited state can be considered as the first member of the sequence of the efimov states occurring near @xmath59 .",
    "however , it differs from the other efimov states in the sense that when the coupling is varied , it remains below the two - body break - up threshold , at least for the simple monotonic potentials we consider here .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels3b ] .",
    "the two - body energy is know analytically for a single exponential potential .",

    ", we wrote our own code : the range parameters are chosen in a geometric progression @xmath62 .",
    "the lowest term can be linked to the energy @xmath35 by the relation @xmath63 suggested by the feshbach - rubinow equation  @xcite . for @xmath64",
    ", we used the code made available by suzuki and varga  @xcite .",
    "we also did some checks based on the hyperspherical expansion .    .",
    "the excited 3-body state ( dashed ) is always found below the 2-body energy . ]",
    "[ fig : levels3b ]",
    "we now replace by a superposition @xmath65 where @xmath11 is significantly shorter ranged than the pair potential entering @xmath16 . in practice",
    ", we will choose the long - range part as of unit range , and @xmath66 , with @xmath67 ranging from 20 to 100 .",
    "note that the computations become rather delicate for @xmath18 , and would require dedicated techniques for larger @xmath67 .    in fig .",

    "red : two - body energy , blue : three - body levels.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the unit of energy is irrelevant , as it can be modified by an overall rescaling of the distances .",
    "comments are in order :    * as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rearr2bs ] , a convex behavior as a function of @xmath6 is observed for the excited energy - levels , i.e. , @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this is permitted , provided that the sum of the first energies remains concave  @xcite . * as in the two - body case , the transition is sharper when the range of the additional potential becomes shorter .",
    "* there is a clear rearrangement , in the sense that for @xmath73 , the excited state falls suddenly near the unperturbed ground - state energy .",
    "* however , there is no second plateau for the excited state , just somewhat a smoothing of the fall - off for  @xmath74 . * for large enough @xmath67",
    ", one observes that when the second level experiences rearrangement , a third state emerges furtively from the two - body threshold , and disappears for larger coupling @xmath6 .",
    "this means that as in the efimov effect , the number of normalizable three - body bound states below the two - body threshold is not a monotonic function of the strength @xmath6 .",
    "let us first concentrate on the region of small @xmath6 .",
    "one can estimate the energy shifts @xmath75 corresponding to a collection of external potentials @xmath76 and short - range potentials @xmath77 , and study empirically the properties of the matrix @xmath78 .    in the two - body case",
    ", one finds that the @xmath79 sub - determinants vanish almost exactly .",
    "this is compatible with a factorization @xmath80 as a product of a long - range term depending only on @xmath45 and a short - range term depending only on @xmath12 .",
    "this is achieved by the deser - trueman formula , with @xmath81 being the square of the wave function at @xmath82 ( times @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 the scattering length .    in the three - body case",
    ", it is observed that the @xmath79 sub - determinants still nearly vanish , especially for the smaller values of the short - range strength @xmath6 , but that the @xmath85 sub - determinants vanish even better ( of course we compared the determinants divided by the typical values of a product of 2 or 3 @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is compatible with @xmath8 being a sum of two factorized contributions , @xmath86 that we conjecture as the generalization of the deser - trueman formula .",
    "it is now rather natural to guess that the first contribution is a simple extension of and reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a short - hand notation for the two - body correlation factor @xmath89 .",
    "it is checked that this term dominates for small shifts , i.e. , for small @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trueman3 ] .",
    "however , this term , if alone , would induce a fall - off the atomic energies toward the nuclear region only for @xmath90 , i.e. , for @xmath91 , the coupling threshold for two - binding .    , and another of range parameter @xmath92 and strength @xmath6 .",
    "]    the second contribution in eq .   should thus account for the genuine three - body effects .",
    "so @xmath93 is a kind of generalized scattering length that blows up when @xmath6 approaches the coupling threshold @xmath94 for three - body binding .",
    "as the theory of three - body scattering is a little intricate , we postpone the precise definition of @xmath93 to some further study . as for the long - range factor @xmath95 of this second term ,",
    "the simplest guess is to assume that it is proportional to the square of the wavefunction at @xmath96 , or in terms of the jacobi variables @xmath97 and @xmath98 describing the relative motion , @xmath99 , but this is seemingly not the case .",
    "our study of generalized exotic atoms is related to the efimov physics , _ _",
    "si parva licet componere magnis__. in particular , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , and probably some others , have studied how the efimov effect is modified if each atom is submitted to an individual harmonic confinement .",
    "they also found that near a point where the two - body scattering length becomes infinite , there is a finite number of three - body bound states , instead of an infinite number in absence of confinement .",
    "the third three - body bound state in the last two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig:2e ] can be interpreted as an efimov state of the short - range potential , modified by the long - range potential .",
    "the lowest states of three - bosons have been calculated with a superposition of long - range and short - range attractive potentials .",
    "when the strength @xmath6 of the latter is increased , starting from @xmath100 , the 3-body energies decreases very slowly , and can be well approximated by a straightforward generalization of the deser - trueman formula involving only the 2-body scattering length .",
    "however , when @xmath6 approaches 0.8 ( in units where @xmath58 is the coupling threshold for binding in the short - range potential alone ) , there is a departure for the deser - trueman formula , which can be empirically accounted for by the product of a short - range and a long - range factor .",
    "the short - range factor is the three - body analog of the scattering length and becomes very large when @xmath101 which corresponds to the occurrence of a borromean bound state in the short - range potential alone .",
    "many developments are required .",
    "what is the precise definition of the three - body short - range factor ?",
    "what is the corresponding long - range factor ?",
    "what is the minimal ratio of range parameters required for the occurrence of the third stable three - body state ?",
    "when does a fourth state show up ?",
    "what are the analogs for @xmath102 bosons",
    "? we also aim at studying some asymmetric systems .",
    "for instance , a prototype of @xmath103 could be built , with a coulomb interaction , that is known to produce a stable ion , below the threshold for breakup into a @xmath104 atom and an isolated proton  @xcite .",
    "then the strong interaction between the two protons and the strange meson @xmath105 could be mimicked by a simple potential of range about @xmath106fm , to study how the existence of a nuclear bound state @xmath103 modifies the atomic spectrum ."
