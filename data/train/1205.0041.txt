    "highly anisotropic layered conductors in a strong magnetic field may undergo a dimensional crossover from three - dimensional ( 3d ) to almost two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron dynamics when the interlayer transfer integral @xmath3 becomes smaller than the other relevant parameters : the scattering rate and the cyclotron frequency .",
    "this crossover may change the electronic transport properties in various layered compounds : organic metals , heterostructures , intercalated compounds , superconductive cuprates and pnictides , cobaltates etc .",
    "scattering by crystal disorder is one of the most frequently discussed mechanisms of breaking the interlayer band transport in layered metals .",
    "if the scattering rate @xmath4 is larger than the interlayer hopping rate , @xmath5 , the quasiparticle momentum and fermi surface are only defined within conducting layers , i.e. become strictly 2d .",
    "however , the interlayer electron tunneling may still be `` coherent '' and conserve the in - plane electron momentum .",
    "the corresponding regime was called `` weakly incoherent''.@xcite in the literature there has been a long - time discussion , supported by theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite arguments , whether this `` weakly incoherent '' regime can be distinguished from the usual three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron transport . up to now , no considerable qualitative differences between 3d and `` weakly incoherent '' regimes have been suggested or observed . the only significant predicted change in the `` weakly incoherent '' regime is the absence of the narrow `` coherence peak '' on the angular dependence of magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is directed along the conducting layerskenz98,mosesmckenzie1999 .",
    "however , the absence of even this subtle feature in the `` weakly incoherent '' regime has not received a sound proof yet .",
    "hence , for a long time it was believedkenz98,mosesmckenzie1999,mckenzie2007,maslov , kuma92 that in this regime the interlayer resistivity @xmath6 is nearly identical to that in the fully coherent three - dimensional ( 3d ) case .",
    "another possible mechanism of dimensional crossover is associated with external magnetic field @xmath7.@xcite indeed , the behavior of magnetic quantum oscillations ( mqo ) is substantially modifiedshoenberg , phsh , shub , so , champelmineev , gvozd2007,harr96,mk04 when the cyclotron frequency @xmath8 becomes larger than the interlayer hopping rate @xmath9 . however , the existing theories predict no significant changes in the electron dynamics at weak ( but coherent ) interlayer electron hopping unless additional mechanisms of interlayer electron transport such as interlayer hopping via the resonance impurities@xcite or boson - assisted@xcite tunneling are concerned.@xcite    in this work we show , that the parameter @xmath10 drives a transition between two qualitatively different regimes of electron dynamics .",
    "there are several principal distinctions in the field dependence of interlayer magnetoresistance at @xmath11 , originating from the qualitatively different influence of disorder on electronic properties .",
    "these changes can not be explained by a simple extension of the formulas in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case @xmath11 , which unambiguously separates this regime from @xmath12 .",
    "we refer to this new regime as `` _ _ weakly coherent _ _ '' : it implies a conservation of the in - plane electron momentum by the interlayer tunneling term in the hamiltonian ; on the other hand , the time scale of this tunneling is much larger than the cyclotron period .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath13 is completely different from the parameter @xmath14 , which was used@xcite to separate the coherent and weakly incoherent regimes .",
    "the proposed weakly coherent regime imposes no limitation on the value of parameter @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , there is no direct relation between the weakly incoherent and the newly defined weakly coherent regimes . on the other hand , the compounds satisfying the condition of the weakly incoherent regime",
    "are automatically driven to the weakly coherent regime by a strong magnetic field such that @xmath16 .    here",
    "we present a joint theoretical and experimental study of the weakly coherent regime , on the example of the layered organic metal @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath17 .",
    "the title compound has a strong anisotropy with the interlayer transfer integral @xmath18@xmath19ev.@xcite at ambient pressure it undergoes a charge - density - wave transition at @xmath20k , which can be suppressed by applying an external pressure @xmath21kbar.@xcite . to avoid complications related to the zero - field and magnetic - field - induced charge - density - wave states @xcite ,",
    "a pressure of 6kbar , considerably exceeding @xmath22 and temperatures above 1k were used , so that the compound was in the fully normal metallic state in our experiment .",
    "the corresponding fermi surface consists of a cylinder ( quasi-2d band ) and a pair of weakly warped open sheets ( quasi-1d band ) .",
    "as will be shown below , the interlayer conductivity in fields above 2  t , is largely determined by the quasi-2d carriers , so we will restrict our analysis to the case of a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "the weakly - coherent criterion @xmath23 in this compound is satisfied at an easily accessible field @xmath24 t , where @xmath25 is the relevant cyclotron mass .",
    "the first step in the theoretical analysis of the weakly coherent regime was made recently in refs .",

    "<S> the field dependence of interlayer magnetoresistance of the pressurized ( to the normal state ) layered organic metal @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1khg(scn)@xmath2 is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the high quasi - two - dimensional anisotropy , when the interlayer hopping time is longer than the electron mean - free time and than the cyclotron period , leads to a dimensional crossover and to strong violations of the conventional three - dimensional theory of magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> the monotonic field dependence is found to change from the conventional behavior at low magnetic fields to an anomalous one at high fields . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of landau levels , determined from the damping of magnetic quantum oscillations , changes from lorentzian to gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the change of electron dynamics in the disorder potential from the usual coherent three - dimensional regime to a new regime , which can be referred to as weakly coherent . </S>"
