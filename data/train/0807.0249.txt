    "the cell growth takes place in a vessel that is continuously stirred . a nutrient containing fluid",
    "is pumped into the vessel and cell culture flows out of the vessel at the same rate , ensuring that the volume of culture in the reaction vessel remains constant .",
    "the rate of flow in and out divided by culture volume is called the _",

    "the rate of cell division in the culture is equal to the dilution rate .",
    "however experimentalists in the late 1960 s , @xcite , observed that instead of settling to a steady state , continuous culture experiments of _ _ could in some cases produce stable oscillations .",
    "von meyenburg , @xcite , discovered in subsequent experiments that these oscillations only occur in an intermediate range of values of the dilution rate ( between about @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "much work has since been done to understand the cause of such oscillations , see for instance @xcite .",
    "_ _ has three metabolic pathways for glucose : fermentation , ethanol oxidation and glucose oxidation .",
    "the model of  @xcite hypothesizes that the competing metabolic pathways of the growing yeast cells create feedback responses that produce stable oscillations .",
    "it assumes that micro - organisms will utilize the available substrates in a manner that maximizes their growth rate at all times . to enforce this optimization a `` maximum function '' is introduced in the model equations ; as a result , the model is an example of a piecewise - smooth , continuous dynamical system .",
    "piecewise - smooth systems are characterized by the presence of codimension - one phase - space boundaries , called _ switching manifolds _ , on which smoothness is lost .",
    "such systems have been utilized in diverse fields to model non - smooth behavior , for example vibro - impacting systems and systems with friction @xcite , switching in electrical circuits @xcite , economics @xcite and biology and physiology , @xcite .",
    "the interaction of invariant sets with switching manifolds often produces bifurcations that are forbidden in smooth systems . for instance , though period - doubling cascades are a common mechanism for the transition to chaos in smooth systems , in piecewise - smooth systems periodic orbits may undergo direct transitions to chaos @xcite .",
    "these so - called _ discontinuity induced bifurcations _ can be nonsmooth analogues of familiar smooth bifurcations or can be novel bifurcations and unique to piecewise - smooth systems .",
    "a bifurcation in the latter category that is simple in appearance ( for example the transition from a stable period-1 solution to a stable period-3 solution in a piecewise - smooth map ) often corresponds to a combination of or countable sequence of smooth bifurcations . in this situation ,",
    "arguably , the piecewise - smooth system describes the dynamics more succinctly than any smooth system is able to .",
    "alternatively bifurcations in piecewise - smooth systems may be extremely complicated , see for instance @xcite and references within .",
    "a piecewise - smooth , continuous system is one that is everywhere continuous but nondifferentiable on switching manifolds . in such a system , the collision of a mathematical equilibrium ( i.e.  steady state , abbreviated to equilibrium throughout this paper ) with a switching manifold may give rise to a _ discontinuous bifurcation_. as the equilibrium crosses the switching manifold , its associated eigenvalues generically change discontinuously .",
    "this may produce a stability change and bifurcation . in two - dimensional systems , all codimension - one discontinuous bifurcations",

    "[ sec : bifset ] we illustrate a two - parameter bifurcation set indicating parameter values at which stable oscillations occur .",

    "in particular , the curves of grazing and hopf bifurcations are tangent to one another at the origin . for this scenario in two - dimensions",

    "we do not have a detailed explanation for this sudden amplitude change . as @xmath14 is increased further ,",
    "the resulting stable orbits undergo a complex sequence of bifurcations causing their periods and amplitudes to decrease , until a second hopf bifurcation occurs resulting again in a stable equilibrium .    for the model ( [ eq : alldot ] ) , a change in the preferred metabolic pathway at an equilibrium results in the loss of differentiability for orbits in its neighborhood .",
    "the result is often a discontinuity induced bifurcation , and we have identified discontinuous saddle - node and hopf bifurcations .",

    "we have provided a rigorous unfolding of these scenarios from a general viewpoint .",
    "while the behavior that we studied are specific to piecewise smooth , continuous models , a model in which this simplification is relaxed should still have much the same behavior .",
    "for example if the relative strength of two competing pathways reverses , then exponential growth will lead to the dominance of one over the other over a small parameter range and a short timescale .",
    "though the bifurcations generic to smooth systems are restricted relative to those of discontinuous systems , a rapid sequence of these bifurcations over a small range of parameters may lead to the same behavior on a rougher scale as the discontinuous one .",
