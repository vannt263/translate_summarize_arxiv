    "the concept of hyperscaling violation @xcite , developed in condensed matter @xcite@xcite , has attracted much attention recently @xcite-@xcite in the context of gauge gravity duality @xcite@xcite .",
    "for example , hyperscaling violation provides a useful way to realize `` compressible matters '' in @xmath6 dimensions @xcite@xcite@xcite and to pursue the holographic realization of systems with fermi surfaces @xcite@xcite .",
    "( see earlier efforts on considering holographic fermi surfaces _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite-@xcite . ) many physically interesting materials at zero temperature , such as high @xmath7 cuprates superconductors , heavy fermion superconductors and organic insulators , are compressible , meaning that the `` density '' of their ground states can be dialed by some quantum tuning parameters , such as chemical doping , pressure and chemical potentials , respectively .",
    "as explained nicely in @xcite , the ground states of compressible quantum matters can be described by a modified hamiltonian @xmath8 in the presence of an @xmath9 symmetry , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are chemical potential and charge associated with the @xmath9 symmetry , which commutes with the original hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "the system needs gapless excitations and requires to satisfy @xmath13 at @xmath14 . using scaling arguments",
    ", one can get @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "thus one naturally has compressible matters for @xmath17 ( luttinger liquids ) , while it is difficult to realize them for @xmath18 .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome in the presence of hyperscaling violation , which effectively gives @xmath19 .",
    "thus the compressible matter at zero temperature in @xmath20 dimensions can be achieved with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "hyperscaling violation is realized in holography as a property of the metric , as was first pointed out in @xcite , based on the extremal solutions at finite density that were found in @xcite .",
    "its implications and importance for strongly coupled condensed matter systems were developed further in @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that holographic backgrounds with dual fermi surfaces can be consistently obtained in the systems satisfying @xmath22 , and thus @xmath21 for @xmath23 , based on various physical grounds @xcite@xcite . in particular , this particular system shows a logarithmic violation of the area law in the holographic entanglement entropy calculation , which is adapted as a working definition of holographic systems with fermi surfaces @xcite based on field theoretic results @xcite .",
    "the holographic entanglement entropy @xcite-@xcite is further used to identify some novel phases , which interpolates between the logarithmic violation and extensive volume dependence of entanglement entropy @xcite@xcite .    while the notion of hyperscaling violation is developed in condensed matter community",
    ", it can also serve as a useful tool for high energy community as well . here",
    "we would like to consider several different classes of microscopic string theory solutions and their simplest dimensional reductions along the compact coordinates .",
    "it becomes clear that hyperscaling violation effects are prevalent upon dimensionally reducing the microscopic string solutions .",
    "one simple observation is that @xmath2 captures the degree of the violation of the conformal / scaling symmetry of the original solutions as well as the degree of compactification .",
    "for example , conformally invariant systems such as d3 , m2 , m5 , d1-d5 and their non - relativistic versions generated by the null melvin twist show @xmath24 upon simple sphere reductions .",
    "motivated by these observations and earlier efforts @xcite@xcite , we investigate the following program .",
    "* the hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath0 can serve as a unified framework for classifying the lower dimensional and low energy effective _ holographic _ theories with scaling symmetries , especially the lifshitz and schrdinger scaling .",
    "* we only consider gravitational metrics for the classifications with undetermined exponents @xmath25 , without referring to the full solution , such as action and matter contents .",
    "* we constrain the parameter space of the consistent solutions using the null energy condition , entanglement entropy analysis and the thermodynamic stability , especially the positivity of the specific heat , along the line of @xcite@xcite@xcite .    this program for constraining the parameter space of the theories with lifshitz scaling at finite temperature",
    "is explicitly compared against the known efforts to do so with full solution in the context of the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories with two parameters @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "these two results are in very good agreements .",
    "even though constraining the consistent parameter spaces using the null energy conditions and positivity of specific heat constraint is expected to serve as a rough guide , our detailed and explicit comparison provides us enough confidences for the validity to do so .",
    "we consider the following general metric to classify lower dimensional and low energy effective theories , holographically dual to field theories with lifshitz and schrdinger scaling symmetries in @xmath26 spatial dimensions at zero temperature @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hyperscaling violation and dynamical exponents , respectively .",
    "from the context .",
    "one can use different , yet equivalent , coordinate system using @xmath30 ( now the boundary sits at @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 which provides the identical exponents @xmath33 and @xmath4 .",
    "this distinction of the correct coordinate system is important to identify these exponents uniquely .",
    "still the distinction can be unclear because the metric at hand is valid only for a given range of the radial coordinate .",
    "moreover , this distinction can be ambiguous at its fundamental level .",
    "one particular example is non - commutative super yang - mills due to the uv - ir correspondence @xcite-@xcite .",
    "similar features are expected for dipole field theories @xcite@xcite and puff field theories @xcite@xcite .",
    "we are grateful to ori ganor and sanny itzhaki for their comments and discussions on them .",
    "[ footnoteuvcoordinate ] ] note that we split the @xmath16 spatial coordinates into two .",
    "the first @xmath34 dimensions have been put into a standard form , @xmath35 , using coordinate transformations .",
    ", which does not allow further coordinate redefinitions on the radial coordinate .",
    "one explicit example is considered in detail in ",
    "[ sec : schrconformalcases ] and  [ sec : schrns5b ] .",
    "[ footnotenosimplescaling ] ] we call these coordinates as _ reference _ coordinates . while @xmath36 can take any general form to provide various different scaling properties for each particular spatial direction , here we consider the simplest cases : the parameter @xmath37 has only the radial dependence as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes `` spatial anisotropic exponent '' of the @xmath40 coordinate relative to the reference coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "these spatial anisotropic exponents are naturally realized in the intersecting dp - dq brane systems  [ sec : dpdqsystem ] and m - brane systems  [ sec : mbrnaesystem ] .",
    "we expect that there are more general class of systems with the spatial anisotropy .",
    "the metric is invariant under the following scaling transformations : @xmath42 it is clear that @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent the usual scaling transformation of the relativistic poincar invariant systems .",
    "thus @xmath45 signifies the spatial anisotropy and broken rotational symmetries between the reference coordinates and the anisotropic coordinates .",
    "it turns out that there can be several equivalent sets of the exponent for the cases with the nontrivial spatial anisotropic exponents , due to the fact that any spatial coordinate is qualified to take the role of the reference coordinate . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us change the reference coordinate from @xmath46 to @xmath47 for a simple case @xmath48 .",
    "then we get @xmath49 which gives the following new exponents @xmath50 after redefining the radial coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "the physical properties described by this set of exponents are equivalent to those described by @xmath52 and the original spatial anisotropic exponents @xmath53 .",
    "if the original anisotropic exponent @xmath54 is negative , it is required to use the coordinate system described in footnote [ footnoteuvcoordinate ] and the results are the same .",
    "the case @xmath55 requires a non - polynomial transformation to achieve the goal , and eventually one sees that the resulting exponents are not well defined .",
    "it is plausible that this case can be formulated with the ration @xmath56 fixed , while @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite .    with these general properties , we consider the physically interesting theories with different scaling properties in turn , depending on the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we also organize our paper accordingly .    * relativistic solutions with full lorentz symmetry .",
    "this case has the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which has the full rotational symmetry on the @xmath63 spatial directions .",
    "this geometry includes the well known ads spaces with conformal symmetry for @xmath64 , which is valid for all the energy scales .",
    "@xmath64 represents the fact that there exists no non - trivial energy scale in the original microscopic string solution .",
    "examples include the dimensional reductions of the d3 , m2 and m5 solutions , which are considered in  [ sec : blackdplif ] [ sec : m2lif ] and [ sec : m5lif ] , respectively .",
    "+ the near extremal black dp brane solutions are another examples of this type , but now with non - zero hyperscaling violation exponent @xmath28 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that non - zero hyperscaling violation is directly related to the fact that there is a non - trivial dimensionful parameter in the original dp brane metrics , which is explicitly demonstrated with dimensional reductions in  [ sec : blackdplif ] .",
    "+ the theories with @xmath43 are the special cases of the lifshitz backgrounds .",

    "the metrics with the negative dynamical exponent means that we are forced to put them in the wrong form with opposite boundary with respect to time .",
    "the kk monopole solution with null melvin twist seems to be well defined .",
    "thus it is reasonable to take this case seriously to investigate whether this makes sense , along with other systems with a negative dynamical exponent .",
    "here we calculate a few physical properties associated with this kk metric , postponing more serious investigations to the future .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the metric can be computed using the prescription given in @xcite . using a strip geometry ,",
    "the entanglement entropy of the metric ( [ basicmetric ] ) with @xmath601 , @xmath524 and @xmath602 can be computed as @xmath603 and @xmath604 where @xmath605 for the kk monopole metric ( [ kkmonopolemetricr ] ) .",
    "the entanglement entropy for a strip in the general metric ( [ basicmetricschr ] ) ( with @xmath606 ) is @xmath607 where @xmath133 is a scale in which the hyperscaling violation becomes important .",
    "the result is rather unusual .",
    "the length @xmath608 is imaginary and the entanglement entropy is also imaginary .",
    "let us calculate the stress energy tensor for this case . @xmath609",
    "the null energy condition is violated in this case .",
    "the stress energy tensor one point functions have opposite sign compared to the cases we consider above .",
    "the static semiclassical propagator is given by @xmath610             \\exp \\left[-m \\frac{d}{\\theta } c_{\\theta / d } |\\delta x_i|^{\\theta / d}\\right ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\           & \\qquad c_{\\theta / d } \\equiv \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\gamma\\left(\\frac{2-\\theta / d}{2(1-\\theta / d ) } \\right ) }          { \\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{2(1-\\theta / d ) } \\right ) } \\right)^{1-\\theta / d } \\;.",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath611 . the result is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "seemingly the physical properties show some unusual properties , such as imaginary entanglement entropy , stress energy tensors with wrong signs .",
    "do they signal that this background is physically not acceptable ? instead of answering the question directly .",
    "we would like to bring out a system with negative dynamical exponent @xcite along with the reference @xcite .",
    "the latter discussed the euclidean version of the metric similar to the one considered here ( [ kkmonopolemetricu ] ) .",
    "it will be interesting to investigate the systems with negative dynamical exponent along the line .",
