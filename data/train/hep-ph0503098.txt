    "<S> , @xmath20 is the dynamical scale of the strong @xmath14 gauge interactions . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the @xmath22 acquires a non - vanishing @xmath24 term ( @xmath25 ) and the susy is spontaneously broken  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the low energy effective superpotential in the messenger sector is given as follows  @xcite : @xmath26 here we introduce @xmath27 sets of vector - like messenger quark multiplets @xmath28 and @xmath29 and lepton multiplets @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the multiplets @xmath33 and @xmath34 transform as @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38 under @xmath39 , so that the gauge coupling unification remains in the models . </S>",
    "<S> note that the perturbativity up to the gut scale @xmath40 allows only cases with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath43 gev , we get @xmath44 at one - loop level in the model with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the model with @xmath45 might be marginally allowed in some particular parameter regions , but we do not discuss it further in this paper . </S>",

    "<S> we also assume that the correction to kahler potential for @xmath22 field induces the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath47   and @xmath48 can be generated dynamically as discussed in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath49 , we may introduce mass terms @xmath50  @xcite . ] . under the following condition , @xmath51 we find the susy - breaking vacuum is true one with vanishing vevs of the messenger squarks and sleptons : @xmath52    the mass terms of the messenger particles are represented as @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote fermionic and bosonic components of the superfield @xmath54 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the matter power spectrum inferred from large samples of lyman-@xmath79 forest data and the cosmic microwave background data of wmap strongly constrain the gravitino mass . as a result </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , however , the susy breaking scale in the messenger sector is suppressed , compared to the original susy breaking scale , due to the transmission mechanism . therefore we stress that the gravitino mass limit is quite severe in most of gauge - mediation models , and it is crucial to have the direct - transmission of dynamical susy breaking in order to construct the gauge - mediation models with @xmath0 ev .    </S>",

    "<S> important experimental bounds on gaugino masses have been set by d0 and cdf experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been searching for diphoton events induced by the lightest neutralino decay into a gravitino plus a photon , subsequent to wino pair production at tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the d0 lower limit on wino mass is about 195 gev  @xcite and currently it is the strongest bound for the models considered here . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ susy_mass_limits ] and [ susy_mass_limits2 ] , the d0 limit is also shown .    </S>",
    "<S> note that in the minimal model ( @xmath41 ) , the predicted upper limits on gaugino masses are half of those in the next - to - minimal model shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ susy_mass_limits ] , and hence the predicted wino mass in the minimal model is smaller than about 160 gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the d0 bound has excluded the minimal model . since models with @xmath98 are not allowed by the perturbativity up to the gut scale as we have mentioned before , the next - to - minimal model is the only viable model .    </S>",
    "<S> the d0 bound constrains the parameter space in the next - to - minimal model . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the parameter @xmath99 has to be larger than about 0.93 for @xmath100=1 , and @xmath100 should be in the range of @xmath101 for @xmath102 , as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ susy_mass_limits ] and  [ susy_mass_limits2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental bound on gluino mass is about @xmath103 gev for the next - to - minimal model , and hence a constraint on @xmath104 is weaker than that of @xmath99 .    </S>",

    "<S> we have assumed that all mass parameters are equal to @xmath110 , @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath112 gev ( in other words , @xmath0 ev ) and @xmath113 , the lightest messenger slepton mass should be smaller than about 50 tev . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ messenger_mass_limit ] , we show a numerical result of the lightest messenger mass as a function of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ messenger_mass_limit ] also shows the dependence on @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> here we have assumed @xmath90 ev , and @xmath115 . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ messenger_mass_limit ] , we see the light messenger slepton mass in the range of about @xmath7 tev is predicted in the consistent region of the next - to - minimal model .    . </S>",
    "<S> we show lines for @xmath116 and @xmath42 . here </S>",
    "<S> we have assumed that @xmath117 and @xmath90 ev.,width=377 ]    the messenger scalar masses within the same @xmath14 doublet slepton multiplet are split at tree level by @xmath118 d - terms . </S>",
    "<S> however the tree - level splitting is negligible  @xcite in the models studied here . </S>",
    "<S> the important splitting is generated at one - loop level by gauge boson loops as follows  @xcite : @xmath119 where @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) is a mass of a charged ( neutral ) component of the messenger doublet slepton . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the neutral component of the messenger slepton , which we call as the messenger sneutrino , can naturally be the lightest messenger particle , and it can be stable in the model . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the stable lightest messenger sneutrino would be a dark matter candidate if its mass is in the range of @xmath122 tev as pointed out in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in order to make a viable model for the messenger dark matter </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce an extra singlet @xmath123 and the following additional superpotential  @xcite : @xmath124 the interaction of the singlet @xmath123 could increase the annihilation cross - section of the messenger sneutrino @xmath125 and it would provide a thermal relic density of the messenger sneutrino @xmath126 consistent with the measured dark matter density  @xcite : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a function of yukawa couplings @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which is of order one .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , recently hooper and march - russell  @xcite has proposed that if the mass of messenger sneutrino dark matter is about @xmath131 tev , it could also account for the multi - tev gamma - ray spectrum from the galactic center observed by hess  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ messenger_mass_limit ] , </S>",
    "<S> next - to - minimal model can predict such a messenger dark matter if @xmath99 is about @xmath132 . in this range of parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted wino mass is about @xmath133 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the gluino ( bino ) is also predicted to be lighter than @xmath134 tev ( @xmath135 gev ) since @xmath136 in order for the messenger sneutrino to be lighter than the messenger squarks .. however , this relation can be easily changed by the gut threshold corrections  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also if the messenger quarks and leptons belong to different gut multiplets , there is no such a unification . ]    in this paper , we have discussed the direct - transmission model of dynamical susy breaking proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that in order to be consistent with the current cosmological bound on the gravitino mass ( @xmath137 ev ) , the direct - transmission of susy breaking is required . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the current d0 limit on wino mass , the minimal model has been ruled out , and the next - to - minimal model is the only consistent model . we have shown that predictions of upper limits on superparticle masses ( @xmath1 tev , @xmath2 gev , @xmath3 gev , @xmath4 tev , @xmath5 tev and @xmath6 gev for gluino , wino , bino , squarks , left - handed sleptons and right - handed sleptons , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that in the consistent region , the next - to - minimal model predicts the light messenger slepton in the mass range of @xmath7 tev , and hence it would be an interesting dark matter candidate to account for the multi - tev gamma - ray spectrum observed by hess experiment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only current and future sparticle searches but also more multi - tev gamma - ray data from hess and cangaroo iii in the coming years would provide a further important insight for the direct - transmission model of the dynamical susy breaking . </S>"
