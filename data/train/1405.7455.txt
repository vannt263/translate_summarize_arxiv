    "the normal section of the junction is semiconducting , and tuning the local potential with voltages on the bottom gates , especially @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig : sketch]a ) modulates the critical current .",

    "a complete penetration of the magnetic field into the normal section of the junction is assumed , and the screening of the field by josephson supercurrents neglected .",
    "@xmath8 is found to have a monotonic , quasi - gaussian decay with @xmath31 ( figure [ fig : sketch]b ) .",
    "the field was not increased beyond @xmath41 , where the switching transition becomes too weak for @xmath8 to be determined . + a similar , monotonic behaviour of @xmath8 in a perpendicular field was observed previously for inas and inn nanowire junctions @xcite . in the narrow planar junction limit with perfect interfaces , @xmath8 is expected to exhibit a gaussian decay @xcite , @xmath42 , due to depairing . here , @xmath36 is the magnetic flux through the junction , @xmath43 , @xmath33 the nanowire diameter , and @xmath37 the ( superconducting ) flux quantum , @xmath44 . the experimental data",
    ", however , is best fit to a curve @xmath45 .",
    "this discrepancy between the numerical factors can be explained in terms of non - ideal interfaces @xcite , i.e. a contact transparency less than @xmath46  see supplementary information .",
    "an axial magnetic field is perpendicular to the rashba spin - orbit direction , and the junction is predicted to enter the topological phase for a certain range of @xmath47 values . here , we study the dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath47 .",
    "the axial field was applied at an angle @xmath48 with respect to the nanowire axis . the misalignment in @xmath47",
    "is shown in the supplementary information to have little effect on fitting the experimental data to the model , so for simplicity in what follows we assume @xmath47 to be aligned .",
    "as with the perpendicular field , a complete penetration of @xmath47 into the normal section of the junction is assumed , and the screening of the field by josephson supercurrents neglected .",
    "+ since the josephson current is aligned with the field direction , naively one would expect no interference effects , and simply a slow decrease in @xmath8 with field due to depairing in the nb leads . however , an oscillating behaviour in @xmath8 vs. @xmath47 is observed , as shown in figure [ fig : sketch]c . in terms of the flux through the axial cross - section of the nanowire @xmath49 ,",
    "the oscillations do not exhibit @xmath37-periodicity .",
    "moreover , the shape and periodicity of the oscillations can be modified by changing the gate voltages . + what is the underlying physics of the observed oscillations ?",
    "recent observations of an oscillatory critical current in insb junctions are consistent with 0-@xmath50 transitions of the junction phase in the presence of spin - orbit and zeeman effects @xcite .",
    "however , we estimate for the inas junction studied here , the magnetic field at which @xmath8 is predicted to have a minimum due to a 0-@xmath50 transition is @xmath51 t , an order of magnitude larger than the values observed @xmath52 ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "instead , we explain the effect as a form of josephson interference that is analogous to the well - known effect for wide planar junctions in a perpendicular field that produces a fraunhofer pattern , but here the azimuthal velocity component of carriers occupying subbands of finite orbital angular momentum yields a phase of magnetic origin , in addition to the zero - field superconducting phase difference across the junction . for simplicity",
    "we consider conduction on a shell , motivated by the tendency in inas nanowires to form a surface accumulation layer of electrons due to the presence of surface states .",
    "furthermore we use classical paths on the shell to calculate the additional phase for a given angular momentum state . while this model is semi - classical and based on simplifying assumptions , it illustrates that orbital subband effects can dominate the behaviour of @xmath8 in an axial field for multi - band nanowire @xmath2 junctions .",
    "good agreement is found between the model and experimental results using a physically reasonable set of fitting parameters .",
    "intrinsic inas nanowires typically have surface band bending @xmath53 @xcite due to the pinning of the fermi energy above the conduction band at the nanowire surface @xcite , and a corresponding surface accumulation of carriers .",
    "we model the inas nanowire junction as a cylindrical shell 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) contacted by nb leads in the geometry of figure [ fig : sketch]a .",
    "the 2deg is assumed to be at a radius @xmath54 from the nanowire center .",
    "we consider relaxing this assumption and allowing more realistic transverse wavefunctions later . for numerical calculations ,",
    "we choose the gauge @xmath55 for the vector potential ( @xmath56 is the azimuthal direction in the @xmath57 plane ) .",
    "+ the motion of an electron in the 2deg can be decomposed into an axial degree of freedom along @xmath58 and an azimuthal degree of freedom along @xmath59 .",
    "the allowed quantum states are characterized by an angular momentum quantum number @xmath60 . in the ballistic limit , classical trajectories of electrons in subband @xmath61 going from source to drain are spiral paths on the cylindrical shell with a winding angle @xmath62 equal to the azimuthal arc length divided by the radius .",
    "so , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 are the axial and azimuthal velocities , respectively , and @xmath65 is explicitly a function of the quantum number @xmath61 .",
    "below we also consider trajectories in the presence of back - scattering .",
    "the andreev process involves an electron and a retroreflected hole , both located in the conduction band of the normal section of the junction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hole is considered to be a time and charge - reversed electron , with the same effective mass @xmath66 , mean free path @xmath21 and radial position .",
    "the relative motion of the electron and hole can be neglected @xcite , and the charge transport described in terms of an ` andreev pair ' @xcite with charge @xmath67 , which follows the same trajectory as the electron .",
    "as long as the center of mass of the andreev pair follows a spiral trajectory , the interference effect should appear , even if the holes do not have the same wavefunctions as electrons .",
    "schematic examples of classical trajectories are shown in figure [ fig : sketch]a for @xmath68 and @xmath69 states .",
    "+ an andreev pair traversing the junction acquires a gauge - independent phase @xmath70 , due to the @xmath71 component of its momentum perpendicular to the field .",
    "this follows from the ginzburg - landau formula for the gauge - invariant phase @xcite .",
    "the line integral , taken from one nb electrode to the other , depends only on the azimuthal angle @xmath72 between the start and finish points , and not on the details of the path . for a spiral trajectory with winding angle @xmath62 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath73 . to our knowledge , the current - phase relationship ( cpr ) of a semiconducting nanowire @xmath2 junction has not been experimentally determined .",
    "since we have @xmath74 , a sinusoidal cpr is assumed .",
    "the phase difference @xmath75 between the nb leads is assumed to be independent of the position along @xmath76 , since the junction width is similar in order to the nb coherence length , @xmath77 , corresponding to the narrow junction limit for a planar junction .",
    "+ similar to the case of a wide planar junction in a perpendicular field @xcite where the superconducting phase depends linearly on the position along the junction width , here the phase due to an axial field is linear in the winding angle @xmath72 . using the sinusoidal cpr",
    ", we define an angular supercurrent density @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the critical current density .",
    "the supercurrent is obtained @xcite by integrating the supercurrent density over @xmath72 : @xmath80 and the critical current is the maximum supercurrent over the junction phase @xmath75 : @xmath81 since @xmath8 and @xmath82 are related as a fourier pair , @xmath79 can be thought of as a spectral density that is a function of winding angle .      we model the spectral density @xmath83 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : critial_current ] ) as a weighted sum of gaussian functions in order to satisfy the following properties : ( i ) the subband @xmath61 contributes a peak to @xmath82 at its winding angle @xmath62 , ( ii ) @xmath82 is proportional to the normal state conductance @xmath84 ,",
    "as required for an @xmath2 junction , ( iii ) @xmath82 goes to zero for large @xmath85 , where the trajectory length is much longer than the phase coherence length @xmath28 . we write @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of radial subbands occupied with angular momentum @xmath61 . here",
    "we allow @xmath88 in the spirit of later relaxing the assumption of strictly two - dimensional shell conduction so that higher radial excitations are possible .",
    "@xmath89 takes into account the suppression of critical current density for large @xmath85 , and is calculated from the usadel equations in the supplementary information .",
    "the gaussian peak width is determined by the parameter @xmath90",
    ". +     spectral densities ( left ) and critical currents ( right ) for the examples given in the text , for ( a , b ) the ballistic regime , and ( c , d ) the quasiballistic regime .",
    "although the spectral density is explicitly a function of the winding angle @xmath72 , here it is plotted versus the magnetic frequency @xmath91 , since the inverse quantity @xmath92 is the conjugate variable to @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ eq : critial_current ] .",
    "( a , b ) a uniform @xmath93 is used in this example .",
    "the resulting @xmath8 is the absolute value of the sum of cosines in eq .",
    "[ eq : sum_of_cos]b .",
    "( c , d ) in the presence of back - scattering , the peaks in @xmath82 move to higher frequencies ( eq . [ eq : qb ] ) as the carriers spend more time in the junction and accumulate more phase .",
    "note that the frequency scales in ( a ) and ( c ) are not the same .",
    "the higher frequency peaks in @xmath82 are suppressed by @xmath94 , which falls off with increasing winding angle , or equivalently , frequency .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath8 are qualitatively similar to the ballistic case , but have a shorter period , and attenuate with magnetic flux due to the broadening @xmath90 of the @xmath82 peaks .",
    "( c , inset ) @xmath95 , as calculated from the usadel equations , vs. @xmath96 . here , @xmath97 is the length of a spiral path with winding angle @xmath72 , and an inelastic scattering length @xmath98 is chosen arbitrarily .",
    "the dashed line is an exponential fit to the @xmath99 region .",
    "longer paths contribute less to @xmath82 because of dephasing , resulting in the suppression of the peak amplitudes with increasing magnetic frequency seen in panel ( c ) .",
    "the following parameters ( defined in the text ) were used in these simulations : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 otherwise.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    let us consider first the ballistic limit @xmath108 .",
    "one would expect sharp peaks ( i.e. @xmath109 ) in @xmath79 at @xmath110 for any subband @xmath61 that is occupied . in this limit",
    ", @xmath111 approximately equals the fermi velocity of the electron , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "we use @xmath114 as the effective mass in inas . as an illustrative example , let @xmath115 for all @xmath72 , and let @xmath87 = 1 for @xmath106 , and zero otherwise .",
    "then , the critical current density is a sum of dirac delta functions , and we have    @xmath116    [ eq : sum_of_cos ]    even though @xmath117 , @xmath118 does not depend on @xmath33 because for a fixed angular momentum , @xmath119 so @xmath120 which cancels with the @xmath121 dependence of flux .",
    "this shows the interference effect is not sensitive to the radial position of carriers in the ballistic regime . in the limit @xmath122 ,",
    "states with finite angular momentum become very high in energy and will not be populated .",
    "+ in figure [ fig : model]a is plotted @xmath79 and @xmath123 for the example above ( eq . [ eq : sum_of_cos ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath62 which determine the peak positions in @xmath83 depend on device - specific parameters @xmath124 , and @xmath33 , and can take on any value .",
    "thus , the periodicity seen in @xmath8 versus @xmath125 generally does not correspond to an integer multiple of @xmath37 .",
    "+ we extend the model for @xmath82 to the quasiballistic regime @xmath126 by invoking the following assumption : the electron undergoes back - scattering events along @xmath58 only .",
    "this is justified as long as the scattering does not substantially mix the orbital angular momentum states , such as when the scattering potential does not explicitly depend on the azimuthal position @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a scattering event @xmath127 , but @xmath65 is unchanged , so on average the particle spends more time in the junction , accumulating more phase . noting that in the ballistic limit we have @xmath128 , the drift velocity along the nanowire axis now becomes @xmath129 .",
    "this follows from the scaling of the conductance @xmath130 from the landauer - bttiker quantum conductance value by the factor @xmath131 , as discussed in refs .",
    "therefore , for quasiballistic transport due to back - scattering , the winding angle @xmath62 is taken as @xmath132 in figure [ fig : model]b we plot @xmath79 in the quasiballistic regime , corresponding to the example where @xmath87 = 1 for @xmath106 and is zero otherwise .",
    "using @xmath21 values typical for these nanowires @xcite , we obtain @xmath133 , so the peaks in @xmath83 appear at higher frequencies ( inverse magnetic flux ) compared to the ballistic case .",
    "the effect of @xmath134 , calculated from the usadel equations , is taken into account .",
    "it suppresses the higher frequency peaks of @xmath82 , since these correspond to longer classical paths of the carriers that will experience greater dephasing .",
    "intuitively , one expects a broader distribution of @xmath83 about each @xmath62-centered peak when back - scattering occurs , and this broadening is parametrized by @xmath90 .",
    "a finite @xmath90 suppresses the recurrences in @xmath8 ; as @xmath90 is increased , the maxima in @xmath8 drop off with increasing magnetic flux .",
    "the experimental data is fit below using this quasiballistic model .",
    "it is shown in the supplementary information that the interference effect is not sensitive to the radial position of the carriers , @xmath54 , up to a rescaling of the broadening parameter @xmath90 , and of the envelope function @xmath135 .      in eq .",
    "[ eq : j_sum_of_peaks ] we have modelled @xmath79 , the spectral density of @xmath8 . in order to fit the model to the experimental data , spectral densities are calculated numerically from the @xmath118 data shown in figure [ fig : fits ] , for three values of gate voltage @xmath18 .",
    "a fast - fourier transform is taken of a signal identical to @xmath136 , but that changes sign at each node so that each becomes a zero crossing .",

    "the following parameters ( defined in the text ) are used but not varied between the three data sets : @xmath34 , @xmath101 , @xmath104 , @xmath103 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "here we discuss the best - fit parameters we obtained by fitting the model to the experimental data ( table [ tab : fitpar ] ) .",
    "the most important variation between the three data sets is the occupation number of angular momentum subbands , @xmath87 , which is modulated by the applied gate voltage . as @xmath18",
    "is made more negative , the fits are consistent with fewer subbands being occupied .",
    "the subbands with higher @xmath61 values depopulate first , in a manner roughly consistent with the expected shell - filling structure of the nanowire @xcite . for a given data",
    "set , only the ratios @xmath143 matter when calculating @xmath144 .",
    "we have adjusted the @xmath87 so that the experimental normal state conductance @xmath84 at each gate voltage is consistent with the estimated number of occupied subbands .",
    "another notable feature in table [ tab : fitpar ] is an apparent increase in elastic mean free path @xmath21 as the gate voltages are made more negative . in the real nanowire junction ,",
    "the radial wavefunction is not confined to a shell but rather is distributed through the nanowire cross section , with some bias towards the surface due to surface band bending .",
    "higher @xmath61 states have a radial expectation value closer to the nanowire surface and are expected to scatter more frequently due to surface defects , which could explain a shorter mean free path when more channels contribute to transport .",
    "note that the fitting involves several free parameters , and the set of best - fit parameters is not generally unique .",
    "the model is based on simplifying assumptions and considers shell conduction only , and also neglects spin - orbit and zeeman effects .",
    "we therefore do not expect this model to capture the complete physics of the junction ; however , it appears to explain the dominant mechanism of the critical current oscillations in the inas device studied here .",
    "+ in conclusion , a nanowire @xmath2 junction was investigated that showed an unexpected modulation of critical current in an axial magnetic field .",
    "this result is understood by considering a novel type of josephson interference due to orbital states in the multi - band inas nanowire .",
    "although we restricted the model to a cylindrical shell , the interference effect does not depend on the diameter @xmath33 , up to a rescaling of the spectral density broadening parameter @xmath90 .",
    "the effect is therefore expected to be present for more general radial wavefunctions , including when electrons and holes forming andreev pairs have different radial wavefunctions . for a more realistic model",
    ", it will be necessary to calculate the josephson interference based on quasiparticle wavefunctions rather than classical trajectories . despite the simplicity of the semi - classical model considered here , it is able to reproduce the main features of the experimental data .",
    "therefore , the interplay of orbital and magnetic effects should be carefully considered for semiconductor nanowire josephson junctions , especially when searching for signatures of topological states .",
