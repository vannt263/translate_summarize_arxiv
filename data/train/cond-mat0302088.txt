    "semiconductor spintronics @xcite is a new field in which the manipulation of carrier spins is a central issue .",
    "the first device proposal in this field was by datta and das , @xcite which consisted of ( 1 ) spin injection from a ferromagnet source contact into a semiconductor two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , ( 2 ) manipulation of the spin with a gate bias through the rashba spin - orbit effect , @xcite and ( 3 ) measurement of the spin with a ferromagnetic drain contact .",
    "progress has recently been made both in spin injection @xcite and in control via the rashba effect @xcite but it appears that there are difficulties in practical implementation of this kind of device .",
    "the demand of sufficiently strong spin - orbit interaction requires a narrow gap semiconductor .",
    "more basically , the spin - orbit interaction driven by the electric field normal to the plane of the electron gas polarizes the electron spin in the plane normal to its wave vector . to reduce spin - cancellation effects among different wave - vectors , @xcite a one - dimensional channel",
    "was suggested .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we describe in theory a different approach to generate and control spin polarization in semiconductors which is based on the spin - dependent properties of thin semiconductor layers in close proximity to a ferromagnet .",
    "time - resolved faraday rotation experiments over the last decade have given much insight into electron spin dynamics in semiconductors .",
    "@xcite in particular , it has been shown that in lightly doped semiconductors the electron spin coherence can persist for hundreds of nanoseconds , @xcite a packet of spin - coherent electrons can be dragged microns using an electrical bias @xcite and can maintain their coherence through an interface between two semiconductors , @xcite and electron spin coherence can produce large nuclear effects@xcite in the semiconductor through the hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "recent pump - probe experiments have been performed on @xmath0-doped semiconductor epilayers in contact with a ferromagnet , demonstrating that the proximity of the ferromagnet can induce large nuclear fields @xcite and spontaneous electron spin polarization @xcite in the semiconductor . in a recent letter , @xcite we gave a theory of spin - dependent reflection at the semiconductor - ferromagnet schottky barrier as an explanation of the origin of the spin polarization . in this long paper",
    ", we provide a detailed treatment of the spin reflection .",
    "we also include calculated results of applying electric bias between the semiconductor and the ferromagnet , stimulated by an ongoing experiment under bias.@xcite we also investigate the different spin reflection properties resulting from optical pumping and from electrical excitation of non - equilibrium carriers in the semiconductor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ reflection ] gives a description of the physics of semiconductor electron spin polarization upon reflection at a semiconductor - ferromagnet interface . in section [ matrix ]",
    "we present the general scattering theory . in section",
    "[ example ] , we apply the theory to the case of schottky junction , showing the role of the schottky barrier , semiconductor doping and applied bias . moreover , we compare the case of optical excitation to that of electrical excitation .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the generation of spin polarization by scattering of spin particles against a spin - polarized target has a long history.@xcite we consider the situation where a non - equilibrium distribution of carriers is injected in the semiconductor ( either electrically or optically ) and determine the transient spin - dependent reflection dynamics .",
    "the semiconductor is assumed to be @xmath0-doped to ensure a reasonably thin schottky barrier ( for sizeable quantum - mechanical coupling between the semiconductor and the ferromagnet ) and reduced spin relaxation .",
    "thus , an initially spin - compensated group of excited electrons will be reflected by the ferromagnetic interface with a net spin polarization .",
    "since the momentum relaxation of the non - equilibrium carriers is much faster than their spin relaxation , the fermi sea in the semiconductor conduction band is left with a spin polarization . in this way",
    ", the spin reflection produces a ferromagnetic `` imprinting '' of the semiconductor electrons . more generally , if the non - equilibrium electrons have a pre - existing spin polarization , the ferromagnetic imprinting manifests itself as a tilting of the original polarization vector .",
    "thus , the spin reflection not only generates a spin polarization , but can also rotate a pre - existing ensemble spin .    in the case of optical excitation",
    "one should also consider the spin dynamics of the excited holes in the valence band .",
    "however , we will neglect any spin effects from the valence band holes .",
    "the holes can gain polarization from the reflection at the interface exactly as the conduction electrons , but the corresponding spin polarization is known to decay very fast due to valence band - mixing.@xcite in particular the hole spin relaxation time is much shorter than the optical electron - hole recombination time . in the case of optical excitation ,",
    "a moderate electron doping is essential to provide very long spin lifetimes@xcite , because the fermi sea acts as a spin reservoir .",
    "the holes will recombine with electrons from the fermi sea and thus remove a strong source of electron relaxation via exchange with the holes.@xcite",
    "to capture the essential physics of the problem we work with a simplified effective mass hamiltonian in both the semiconductor and the ferromagnet.@xcite the effective mass approximation , though suitable for semiconductor heterostructures , can not possibly account for all band properties of the ferromagnetic metal.@xcite we shall investigate one improvement of the wave function matching between the dissimilar metal and semiconductor media.@xcite the general results we present should remain valid with more realistic calculations .",

    "the second term represents the spin - independent part of the potential energy . in the semiconductor region ( @xmath4 )",
    ", the potential @xmath5 produces the band - bending due to the space charge layer associated with the schottky barrier .",
    "@xmath5 can be tailored by proper heterostructure engineering ( for example by inserting a delta - doped layer at the interface ) or by applying _ in situ _ an electrostatic bias . as we will show in detail in section [ example ] , the profile of @xmath5 can drastically modify the spin - dependent coupling between semiconductor and ferromagnet .",

    "the zeeman splitting has a negligible effect on the spin polarization because it is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange splitting in the ferromagnet and the schottky barrier height .",

    "there are three basic vectors in the problem that determine the faraday rotation : the external field @xmath17 , the ferromagnet magnetization @xmath48 , and the injected pump polarization @xmath36 .",

    "for low doping , the change of sign as a function of bias has been pushed down to negative bias for the same reason as the disappearance of the change of sign in fig .",
    "[ schottky_optical](b ) for low doping .",
    "the spin reflection difference is dominated by the electrons pumped high in the barrier , which have the opposite sign of polarization compared with the electrons near the fermi level in the semiconductor .",
    "there is a caveat to these special effects .",
    "a more realistic model would use an electron wavepacket to reflect off the interface in order to account for the significant scattering due to efficient optical phonon emission .",
    "the electrons pumped high in the barrier would be in a region with almost no background electron density , so that the spin lifetime may be shorter than the lifetime outside the depletion region .",
    "our purpose here is to point out that electrical and optical experiments can give inconsistent results if it is assumed that the underlying mechanism is exactly the same in both cases .",
    "electrically excited electrons stay close to the fermi level , while optically excited electrons exist all over the barrier .",
    "the pumping in the barrier drastically alters the spin reflection difference which would be observed in in experiments on the interface , and hence care must be taken when comparing optically excitation experiments with electrical injection experiments . in particular ,",
    "the optically excited electrons pumped high in the barrier can have different sign of polarization to electrons lower in the barrier , making it difficult to compare polarizations from experiments involving optical versus electrical injection .",
    "we have examined the electronic properties associated with semiconductor electrons that are in proximity with a ferromagnet . instead of focusing on the injection of ferromagnet electrons into the semiconductor through the interface ,",
    "we have instead chosen to look at the properties of semiconductor electrons that can interact with a ferromagnetic epilayer .",
    "we have focused on the reflection of non - equilibrium electrons from the interface .    for doped semiconductors with ferromagnetic epilayers , we have calculated the spin - dependent reflectivities for electrons incident on the schottky barrier from the semiconductor .",
    "we find that the shape of the barrier has a large impact on the asymmetry between reflection for the two spin channels , and significantly that the sign of the difference can change depending on the system parameters .",
    "we have included calculations that mimic the behavior of optical excitation , which can radically affect the spin reflection difference . the ability to control the sign and magnitude of the spin polarization by tuning the properties of the schottky barrier ( through the semiconductor doping or through an applied bias , for example ) may be useful for device design .",
    "in contrast to spin injection from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor , spin reflection has the advantage that the processes are kept in the semiconductor . for carriers confined near the interface , multiple reflections from the interface can enhance the single - reflection spin asymmetry , yielding larger polarizations .",
    "such reasoning has led us to propose a spin - valve device with ferromagnetic gates.@xcite a detailed study of the coupling of the equilibrium and transport properties of a confined semiconductor electron system in contact with the ferromagnet will be the subject of another long paper .",
