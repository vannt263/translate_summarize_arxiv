    "the standard nwa is obtained by replacing the distribution @xmath214 , which  acting on the residual differential cross section @xmath215",
    " gives the total cross section , by a rescaled dirac distribution , i.e. @xmath216 which is motivated by the observation that the breit - wigner shape suppresses the contributions with @xmath217 .",
    "that is , for small @xmath0 , @xmath218 essentially eliminates all contributions of @xmath219 except for the on - shell part , and in the limit @xmath21 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 are asymptotically equal .",
    "however , for finite @xmath0 the @xmath15-dependence of the phase - space factors and residual matrix elements can cause a significant deformation of the shape of @xmath222 relative to the breit - wigner shape @xmath223 , resulting in a considerable shift of the maximum position and maximal value .",
    "the effect is particularly strong when @xmath3 is close to the kinematic bounds , where threshold - type factors suppress the resonant contribution and shift the maximum .",
    "focusing on the impact of the @xmath15-dependence of the process - independent phase - space factors , we write @xmath224 , where @xmath225 denotes the integrand factor arising from the phase - space element .",
    "even though the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath225 deforms the breit - wigner , the shape of @xmath226 is also strongly peaked and thus suggests a nwa - inspired approximation , which takes into account the shift of the maximum position caused by @xmath225 .",
    "more specifically , we propose to substitute the mass of the resonance @xmath3 with an effective mass @xmath227 in @xmath221 . in analogy to @xmath22 being the maximum position of the breit - wigner ,",
    "@xmath228 is given by the position of the maximum of @xmath226 : @xmath229 the thus defined effective mass only exploits kinematic information and is hence universal for the class of processes with identical phase - space properties . can be obtained by numerical , one - dimensional maximization of @xmath230 with @xmath37 as suitable initial value , the computational complexity of its determination is negligible . in theories with mass relations",
    "it may be necessary to adjust other parameters to maintain theoretical properties like gauge invariance . ] due to @xmath231 , the deviation of the effective mass from the physical mass is negligible unless @xmath3 is close to the kinematic bounds .",
    "therefore , the proposed phase - space improved narrow - width approximation ( psinwa ) does not result in significant deviations in cases where the standard nwa gives @xmath232-accurate results . on the other hand , when @xmath3 approaches a kinematic bound the behavior is improved : since the distance between @xmath227 and the bound stays finite the psinwa result does not vanish .",
    "the psinwa error is therefore bounded in contrast to the diverging standard nwa error .    to exemplify this method",
    ", we consider the scalar resonant @xmath1-body decay sss - sss ( see sec .",
    "[ modindep ] ) . with @xmath233 and kinematic",
    "conventions as in fig .",
    "[ threebody - kinematics ] , the 3-particle phase - space element is given by @xmath234 where @xmath235 @xmath228 is thus obtained via maximization of @xmath236 in fig .",

    "the divergence of the standard nwa error in this region is also clearly visible . with increasing distance to the kinematic bounds ,",
    "on the other hand , the psinwa and standard nwa results converge and are both of @xmath232 .",
    "the psinwa is general in the sense that the effective mass does not depend on the process matrix elements , and as effective - mass method it preserves the on - shell simplifications of the standard nwa .",
    "the former strength is , however , also a potential shortcoming , since for some processes breit - wigner deformation is also caused by the @xmath15-dependence of the residual matrix elements , which may have to be taken into account to achieve the desired approximation accuracy .",
    "as long as the deformed breit - wigner shape is still strongly peaked , the proposed method can be extended : a process - specific effective mass can be calculated by maximizing @xmath243 ( and possibly also treating the width as free parameter ) . , may not be available in analytical form .",
    "the computation of @xmath228 will then be more expensive . ] for cases where the breit - wigner deformation is so severe that a modified mass is not sufficient to obtain the desired accuracy , it may be possible to successfully apply the process - specific method proposed in ref .",
    "we studied the general properties of the nwa with polarization / spin decorrelation . after defining the nwa and clarifying the treatment of polarization and spin correlations",
    ", we proved for sufficiently inclusive rates of arbitrary resonant decay and scattering processes with an on - shell intermediate state decaying via a cubic or quartic vertex that decorrelation effects vanish and the nwa is of order @xmath0 . when applied in perturbative calculations ,",
    "the nwa uncertainty is commonly estimated as between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we tested this assumption by systematically determining the nwa accuracy numerically for all resonant @xmath1-body decays involving scalars , spin-@xmath2 fermions or vector bosons .",
    "we found that the approximation error will exceed the @xmath232 estimate for mass configurations in an extended vicinity of segment kinematic bounds .",
    "this is due to a significant distortion of the breit - wigner peak and tail , which is effected by the @xmath15-dependence of the phase - space elements and the residual matrix elements . while factorizing coupling parameters do not affect the relative nwa error , for processes with sff or vff vertices a strong dependence on",
    "the relative strength of the chiral couplings can exist .",
    "we specialized the general results to mssm benchmark scenarios and presented results for sps 1a .",
    "we found that significant off - shell corrections can occur  similar in size to qcd corrections . to simplify a combined treatment we proposed a modified , process - independent approximation that exhibits an improved accuracy close to kinematic boundaries while preserving the simplifying power of the standard nwa .",
