    "one of the main goals of percolation theory  @xcite in recent decades has been to understand the geometric structure of percolation clusters .",
    "considerable insight has been gained by decomposing the incipient infinite cluster into a _",
    "backbone _ plus _ dangling bonds _ , and then further decomposing the backbone into _ blobs _ and _ red bonds _  @xcite .    to define the backbone , one typically fixes two distant sites in the incipient infinite cluster , and defines the backbone to be all those occupied bonds in the cluster which belong to trails   between the specified sites  @xcite .",
    "the remaining bonds in the cluster are considered dangling .",
    "similar definitions apply when considering spanning clusters between two opposing sides of a finite box  @xcite ; this is the so - called _ busbar _ geometry .",
    "the bridges   in the backbone constitute the red bonds , while the remaining bonds define the blobs . at criticality ,",
    "the average size of the spanning cluster scales as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the linear system size and @xmath4 the fractal dimension .",
    "similarly , the size of the backbone scales as @xmath5 , and the number of red bonds as @xmath6 .    while exact values for @xmath4 and @xmath7 are known  @xcite ( see  ) , this is not the case for @xmath8 . in  @xcite",
    "however , it was shown that @xmath9 coincides with the so - called monochromatic path - crossing exponent @xmath10 with @xmath11",
    ". an exact characterization of @xmath12 in terms of a second - order partial differential equation with specific boundary conditions was given in  @xcite , for which , unfortunately , no explicit solution is currently known .",
    "the exponent @xmath12 was estimated in  @xcite using transfer matrices , and in  @xcite by studying a suitable correlation function via monte carlo simulations on the torus .    in this paper , we consider a natural partition of the edges of a percolation configuration , and study the fractal dimensions of the resulting clusters .",
    "specifically , we classify all occupied bonds in a given configuration into three types : branches , junctions and nonbridges .",
    "a bridge is a _ branch _ if and only if at least one of the two clusters produced by its deletion is a tree .",
    "junctions are those bridges which are not branches .",
    "deleting branches from percolation configurations produces _ leaf - free _ configurations , and further deleting junctions from leaf - free configurations generates bridge - free configurations .",
    "these definitions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "it is often useful to map a bond configuration to its corresponding baxter - kelland - wu ( bkw )  @xcite loop configuration , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the loop configurations are drawn on the medial graph  @xcite , the vertices of which correspond to the edges of the original graph .",
    "the medial graph of the square lattice is again a square lattice , rotated @xmath13 .",
    "each unoccupied edge of the original lattice is crossed by precisely two loop arcs , while occupied edges are crossed by none .",
    "the continuum limits of such loops are of central interest in studies of scharmm lwner evolution ( sle )  @xcite . at the critical point , the mean length of the largest loop scales as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the hull fractal dimension .",
    "a related concept is the accessible external perimeter  @xcite .",
    "this can be defined as the set of sites that have non - zero probability of being visited by a random walker which is initially far from a percolating cluster .",
    "the size of the accessible external perimeter scales as @xmath16 with @xmath17 .    in two dimensions , coulomb - gas arguments  @xcite",
    "predict the following exact expressions for @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath15 and @xmath18 @xmath19 where for percolation the coulomb - gas coupling @xmath20  . ] .",
    "we note that the magnetic exponent @xmath21 , the two - arm exponent  @xcite satisfies @xmath22 , and that for percolation the thermal exponent @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the two - arm exponent gives the asymptotic decay @xmath24 of the probability that at least two spanning clusters join inner and outer annuli ( of radii o(1 ) and @xmath3 respectively ) in the plane .",
    "we also note that @xmath18 and @xmath15 are related by the duality transformation @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the most precise numerical estimate for @xmath8 currently known is @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "we study critical bond percolation on the torus @xmath27 , and show that as a consequence of self - duality the density of bridges and nonbridges both tend to 1/4 as @xmath28 .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , we observe that despite the fact that around 43% of all occupied edges are branches , the fractal dimension of the leaf - free clusters is simply @xmath4 , while their hulls are governed by @xmath15 .",
    "by contrast , the fractal dimension of the bridge - free configurations is @xmath8 , and that of their hulls is @xmath18 .",
    "[ fig : configuration ] shows a typical realization of the largest cluster in critical square - lattice bond percolation , showing the three different types of bond present .    in more detail ,",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the leading finite - size correction to the density of nonbridges scales with exponent @xmath29 , consistent with @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that the probability that a given edge is not a bridge but has both its loop arcs in the same loop decays like @xmath24 as @xmath28 .",
    "the leading finite - size correction to the density of junctions also scales with exponent @xmath29 , while the density of branches is almost independent of system size .",
    "the fractal dimension of leaf - free clusters is @xmath31 , consistent with @xmath32 for percolation clusters .",
    "the hull fractal dimension for leaf - free configurations is @xmath33 , consistent with @xmath34 .",
    "the fractal dimension for bridge - free clusters is consistent with @xmath8 , and we provide the improved estimate @xmath35 .",
    "the hull fractal dimension for bridge - free configurations is @xmath36 , consistent with @xmath37 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model_algorithm_quantities ] introduces the model , algorithm and sampled quantities .",
    "numerical results are summarized and analyzed in section  [ results ] .",
    "a brief discussion is given in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we study critical bond percolation on the @xmath38 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , with linear system sizes @xmath39 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 48 , 64 , 96 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , and 4096 . to generate a bond configuration",
    ", we independently visit each edge on the lattice and randomly place a bond with probability @xmath40 . for each system size",
    ", we produced at least @xmath41 independent samples ; for each @xmath42 we produced more than @xmath43 independent samples .",
    "a _ leaf _ in a percolation configuration is a site which is adjacent to precisely one occupied bond . given a percolation configuration we generate the corresponding _ leaf - free _ configuration via the following iterative procedure , often referred to as _",
    "burning_. for each leaf , we delete its adjacent bond . if this procedure generates new leaves , we repeat it until no leaves remain .",
    "the bonds which are deleted during this iterative process are precisely the branches defined in section  [ introduction ] .",
    "the bridges in the leaf - free configurations are the junctions . deleting the junctions from the leaf - free configurations then produces bridge - free configurations .",
    "the algorithm we used to efficiently identify junctions in leaf - free configurations is described in sec .",
    "[ algorithm ] .      given an arbitrary graph @xmath44",
    ", the bridges can be identified in @xmath45 time  @xcite . rather than applying such graph algorithms to identify the junctions in our leaf - free configurations however , we took advantage of the associated loop configurations .",
    "these loop configurations were also used to measure the observable @xmath46 , defined in section  [ measured quantities ] .",
    "consider an edge @xmath47 which is occupied in the leaf - free configuration , and denote the leaf - free cluster to which it belongs by @xmath48 . in the planar case ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath47 will be a bridge iff the two loop segments associated with it belong to the same loop .",
    "more generally , the same observation holds on the torus provided @xmath48 does not simultaneously wind in both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions .",
    "if @xmath48 does simultaneously wind in both the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , loop arguments may still be used , however the situation is more involved .",
    "it clearly remains true that if the two loop segments associated with @xmath47 belong to different loops , then @xmath47 is a nonbridge .",
    "suppose instead that the two loop segments associated with @xmath47 belong to the same loop , which we denote by @xmath51 .",
    "deleting @xmath47 breaks @xmath51 into two smaller loops , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for each such loop , we let @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the winding numbers in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , respectively , and we define @xmath56 . as we explain below , the following two statements hold :    1 .",
    "[ bridge test ] if @xmath57 or @xmath58 , then @xmath47 is a bridge .",
    "[ nonbridge test ] if @xmath59 and @xmath60 , then @xmath47 is a nonbridge .    as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] edge 1 is a junction while edge 2 is a nonbridge , despite both of them being bounded by the same loop .",
    "edge 1 can be correctly classified using statement  [ bridge test ] , while edge 2 can be correctly classified using statement  [ nonbridge test ] .    by making use of these observations ,",
    "all but very few edges in the leaf - free clusters can be classified as bridges / nonbridges .",
    "we note that in our implementation of the above algorithm , the required @xmath61 values can be immediately determined from the stored loop configuration without further computational effort . for the small number of edges to which neither of the above two statements apply ,",
    "we simply delete the edge and perform a connectivity check using simultaneous breadth - first search .",
    "this takes @xmath62 time per edge tested  @xcite .",
    "we now justify statement  [ bridge test ] . in this case , the loop @xmath52 is contained in a simply - connected region on the surface of the torus .",
    "the cluster contained within the loop @xmath52 is therefore disconnected from the remainder of the lattice , implying that @xmath47 is a bridge .",
    "edge 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] provides an illustration .",
    "finally , we justify statement  [ nonbridge test ] . in this case ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 either both wind in the @xmath49 direction , or both in the @xmath50 direction ( one winds in the positive sense , the other in the negative sense ) .",
    "suppose they wind in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "it then follows from the definition of the bkw loops that there can be no @xmath49-windings in the cluster @xmath63 . by assumption",
    "however , @xmath48 does contain an @xmath49-winding , so it must be the case that @xmath47 belongs to a winding cycle in @xmath48 that winds in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "the edge @xmath47 is therefore not a bridge .",
    "edge 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] provides an illustration .      from our simulations , we estimated the following quantities .    1 .",
    "the mean density of branches @xmath64 , junctions @xmath65 , and nonbridges @xmath66 .",
    "2 .   the mean size of the largest cluster @xmath67 3 .   the mean size of the largest leaf - free cluster @xmath68 4 .",
    "the mean size of the largest bridge - free cluster @xmath69 5 .",
    "the mean length of the largest loop , @xmath46 , for the loop configuration associated with leaf - free configurations 6 .",
    "the mean length of the largest loop , @xmath70 , for the loop configuration associated with bridge - free configurations    we note that fewer samples were generated for @xmath67 and @xmath70 than for other the quantities .",
    "in sections  [ bond density ] ,  [ fractal dimension of clusters ] ,  [ fractal dimension of loops ] , we discuss least - squares fits for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath46 , @xmath70 .",
    "the results are presented in tables  [ tab : bond_density ] ,  [ tab : fd_clusters ] and  [ tab : fd_loops ] . in section  [ fitting methodology ] , we first make some comments on the anstze and methodology used",
    ".      let @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) denote the mean density of occupied edges whose two associated loop segments belong to the same ( distinct ) loop(s ) . from lemma  [ loop lemma ] in appendix  [ loop lemma appendix ] , we know that for @xmath40 bond percolation on @xmath27 we have @xmath73 for all @xmath3 . in the plane however , an edge is a bridge iff the two associated loop segments belong to the same loop .",
    "we therefore expect that both @xmath66 and @xmath74 should converge to 1/4 as @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , there is a natural interpretation of the quantity @xmath75 .",
    "as noted in section  [ algorithm ] , if the two loop segments associated with an edge belong to different loops , then that edge can not be a bridge .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 is equal to the probability of the event that `` a given edge is not a bridge but has both its loop arcs in the same loop '' .",
    "let us denote this event by @xmath76 .",
    "studying the finite - size behaviour of @xmath66 will therefore allow us to study the scaling of @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 , it follows that @xmath79 is also equal to @xmath77 .",
    "armed with the above observations , we fit our monte carlo data for the densities @xmath65 , @xmath64 and @xmath66 to the finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath80 we note that since @xmath81 for all @xmath3 , the finite - size corrections of @xmath74 should be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the finite - size corrections of @xmath66 . since @xmath82",
    ", the latter should be positive and the former negative .",
    "finally , we note that the event @xmath76 essentially characterizes edges which _ would _ be bridges in the plane , but which are prevented from being bridges on the torus by windings . by construction",
    ", branches always have at least one end attached to a tree , suggesting that they can not be _ trapped _ in winding cycles in this way .",
    "this would suggest that it should be @xmath65 that contributes the leading correction of @xmath74 away from its limiting value of 1/4 .",
    "the observables @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath46 , @xmath70 are expected to display non - trivial critical scaling , and we fit them to the finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the appropriate fractal dimension .    as a precaution against correction - to - scaling terms that we failed to include in the fit ansatz , we imposed a lower cutoff @xmath85 on the data points admitted in the fit , and we systematically studied the effect on the @xmath86 value of increasing @xmath87 .",
    "generally , the preferred fit for any given ansatz corresponds to the smallest @xmath88 for which the goodness of fit is reasonable and for which subsequent increases in @xmath88 do not cause the @xmath86 value to drop by vastly more than one unit per degree of freedom . in practice , by `` reasonable '' we mean that @xmath89 , where df is the number of degrees of freedom .    in all the fits",
    "reported below we fixed @xmath90 , which corresponds to the exact value of the sub - leading thermal exponent  @xcite .      leaving @xmath91 free in the fits of @xmath65 and @xmath66 we estimate @xmath92 .",
    "we therefore conjecture that @xmath93 , which we note is precisely equal to the two - arm exponent @xmath94 .",
    "we comment on this observation further in section  [ discussion ] .    for @xmath64 by contrast",
    ", we were unable to obtain stable fits with @xmath91 free .",
    "fixing @xmath95 , the resulting fits produce estimates of @xmath96 that are consistent with zero .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath64 is consistent with 0.21405018 for all @xmath97 . this weak finite - size dependence of @xmath64 is in good agreement with the arguments presented in section  [ fitting methodology ] .",
    "all the fits for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 gave estimates of @xmath98 consistent with zero .",
    "we therefore set @xmath99 identically in the fits reported in table  [ tab : bond_density ] .    from the fits , we estimate @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we note that @xmath103 within error bars , as expected .",
    "the fit details are summarized in table  [ tab : bond_density ] .",
    "we also note that the estimates of @xmath96 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign , which is as expected given that @xmath96 is consistent with zero for @xmath64 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bond_density ] , we plot @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 versus @xmath104 .",
    "the plot clearly demonstrates that the leading finite - size corrections for @xmath65 and @xmath66 are governed by exponent @xmath94 , while essentially no finite - size dependence can be observed for @xmath64 .",

    "we have studied the geometric structure of percolation on the torus , by considering a partition of the edges into three natural classes . on the square lattice , we have found that leaf - free configurations have the same fractal dimension and hull dimension as standard percolation configurations , while bridge - free configurations have cluster and hull fractal dimensions consistent with the backbone and external perimeter dimensions , respectively .",
    "in addition to the results discussed above , we have extended our study of leaf - free configurations to site percolation on the triangular lattice and bond percolation on the simple - cubic lattice , the critical points of which are respectively 1/2 and 0.24881182(10 )  @xcite .",
    "we find numerically that the fractal dimensions of leaf - free clusters for these two models are respectively 1.8957(2 ) and 2.5227(6 ) , both of which are again consistent with the known results @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xcite for @xmath4 . in both cases ,",
    "our data show that the density of branches is again only very weakly dependent on the system size .",
    "it would also be of interest to study the bridge - free configurations on these lattices .",
    "in addition to investigating the fractal dimensions for cluster size , and in the triangular case also the hull length , it would be of interest to determine whether the leading finite - size correction to @xmath66 is again governed by the two - arm exponent .",
    "the two - arm exponent is usually defined by considering the probability of having multiple spanning clusters joining inner and outer annuli in the plane . as noted in section  [ fitting methodology ]",
    "however , our results show that for percolation , the two - arm exponent also governs the probability of a rather natural geometric event on the torus : the event that a given edge is not a bridge but has both its loop arcs in the same loop .",
    "this provides an interesting alternative interpretation of the two - arm exponent in terms of toroidal geometry .",
    "let us refer to an edge that is not a bridge but has both its loop arcs in the same loop as a _",
    "pseudobridge_. we note that an alternative interpretation of the observation that @xmath107 is that the number of pseudobridges @xmath108 scales as @xmath6 .    a natural question to ask is to what extent the above results carry over to the general setting of the fortuin - kasteleyn random - cluster model .",
    "consider the case of two dimensions once more . in that case , we know that if we fix the edge weight to its critical value and take @xmath109 we obtain the uniform spanning trees ( ust ) model .",
    "for this model all edges are branches , and so the leaf - free configurations , which are therefore empty , certainly do not scale in the same way as ust configurations . despite this observation , preliminary simulations   and the chayes - machta algorithm  @xcite for @xmath110 . ]",
    "performed on the toroidal square lattice at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 suggest that , for all @xmath118 $ ] , the leaf - free configurations have the same fractal dimension and hull dimension as the corresponding standard random cluster configurations . in the context of the random cluster model ,",
    "the behaviour of the leaf - free configurations for the ust model therefore presumably arises via amplitudes which vanish at @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , these preliminary simulations suggest that the number of pseudobridges in fact scales as @xmath6 for the critical random cluster model at any @xmath118 $ ]",
    ". it would also be of interest to determine whether the fractal dimensions of cluster size and hull length for bridge - free random cluster configurations again coincide with @xmath8 and @xmath18 when @xmath120 .",
