    "much of the radiation from luminous accreting black holes is released within the innermost 10 - 20 gravitational radii ( i.e. @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ) . in such an energetic environment",
    ", iron is a major source of line emission , with strong emission lines in the 6.46.9  kev band .",
    "observations of such line emission then provides us with a diagnostic of the accretion flow and the behaviour of matter and radiation in the strong gravity regime very close to the black hole ( fabian  2000 ; reynolds & nowak 2003 ; fabian & miniutti 2005 ) .",
    "the rapid x - ray variability found in many seyfert galaxies is strong evidence for the emission orginating at small radii .",
    "the high frequency break in their power spectra , for example , corresponds to orbital periods at @xmath3 and variability is seen at still higher frequencies ( uttley & mchardy 2004 ; vaughan  2004 ) .",
    "key evidence that the very innermost radii are involved comes from soltan s ( 1982 ) argument relating the energy density in radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to the local mean mass density in massive black holes , which are presumed to have grown by accretion which liberated that radiation .",
    "the agreement found between these quantities requires that the radiative efficiency of accretion be 10 per cent or more ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi  2005 ) .",
    "this exceeds the 6 per cent for accretion onto a non - spinning schwarzschild black hole and inevitably implies that most massive black holes are rapidly spinning with accretion flows extending down to a just few @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , this is where most of the radiation in such accretion flows originates .",
    "the x - ray spectra of agn are characterized by several components : a hard power - law which may turnover at a few hundred kev , a soft excess and a reflection component ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this last component is produced from surrounding material by irradiation by the power - law .",
    "it consists of backscattered x - rays , fluorescence and other line photons , bremsstrahlung and other continua from the irradiated surfaces .",
    "examples of reflection spectra from photoionized slabs are shown in fig .",
    "2 . at moderate ionization parameters ( @xmath5  erg  cm  s@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ionizing flux and @xmath8 the density of the surface ) the main components of the reflection spectrum are the compton hump peaking at @xmath9  kev , the iron line at 6.46.9  kev ( depending on ionization state ) and a collection of lines and reradiated continuum below 1  kev .",
    "when such a spectrum is produced from the innermost parts of an accretion disk around a spinning black hole , the outside observer sees it smeared and redshifted ( fig .",
    "2 ) due to doppler and gravitational redshifts .",
    "another , potentially powerful , diagnostic of the strong gravity regime is the study of timing and quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) . despite the richness of the data ( e.g. strohmayer 2001 )",
    ", there is no consensus on how to interpret them and they will not be discussed further here .",
    "all three main parts of the reflection spectrum have now been seen from agn and galactic black holes ( gbh ) .",
    "the broad iron line and reflection hump are clearly seen in the seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 and in the gbh j1650 - 400 .",
    "more recently it has been realised that the soft excess in many agn can be well explained by smeared reflection ( crummy  2006 ) .",
    "it had been noted by czerny ( 2003 ) and by gierlinski & done ( 2004 ) that the soft excess posed a major puzzle if thermal since the required temperature was always about 150  ev , irrespective of black hole mass , luminosity etc . explaining it as a feature due to smeared atomic lines resolves this puzzle .",
    "an alternative interpretation involves smeared absorption lines ( gierlinski & done 2004 ) .",
    "the extent of the blurring of the reflection spectrum is determined by the innermost radius of the disk ( fig .",
    "3 ) . assuming that this is the radius of marginal stability enables the spin parameter @xmath10 of the hole to be measured .",
    "objects with a very broad iron line like mcg6 - 30 - 15 are inferred to have high spin @xmath11 ( dabrowski 1997 ; brennemann  2006 ) .",
    "some ( krolik & hawley 2002 ) have argued that magnetic fields in the disk can blur the separation between innermost edge of the disk and the inner plunge region so that the above assumption is invalid .",
    "this probably makes little difference for the iron line however since the low ionization parameter of most observed reflection reflection requires that the disc matter is very dense .",
    "the density of matter in the plunge region drops very rapidly to a low values ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) and only very strong magnetic fields , much larger than are inferred in disks , can stop this steep decline in density .",
    "any reflection from the plunge region will be very highly ionized and so produce little iron emission .",
    "broad iron lines and reflection components are seen in both agn ( e.g. tanaka  1995 ; nandra  1997 ) and gbh ( martocchia & matt 2002 ; miller  2002abc , 2003ab , 2004ab ) .",
    "a recent exciting development are the reports that broad iron lines are present in 50 per cent of all xmm agn observations where the data are of high quality ( more than 150,000 counts ; guanazzi  2006 ; nandra  2006 ) .",
    "they are not found in all objects or in all accretion states .",
    "there are many possible reasons for this , including overionization of the surface , low iron abundance , and beaming of the primary power - law away from the disk ( e.g. if the power - law originates from the mildly - relativistic base of the jet ) .    in many cases",
    "there is a narrow iron line component due to reflection from distant matter .",
    "absorption due to intervening gas , warm absorbers and outflows from the agn , as well as the interstellar medium in both our milky way galaxy and the host galaxy must be accounted for .",
    "moreover , if most of the emission emerges from within a few gravitational radii and the abundance is not high , then the extreme blurring can render the blurred reflection undetectable ( fabian & miniutti 2005 ) .    in order to distinguish between the various spectral components , both emission and absorption , we can use higher spectral resolution , broader bandwidth and variability .",
    "an example of the use of higher spectral resolution is the work of young  ( 2005 ) with the chandra high energy gratings ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15 fail to show absorption lines or feature associated with iron of intermediate ionization .",
    "such gas could cause some curvature of the apparent continuum mimicking a very broad line .",
    "a broader bandwidth is very useful in determining the slope of the underlying continuum .",
    "this has been shown using bepposax ( e.g. guainazzi  1999 ) and now in several sources with suzaku ( fig . 5 , miniutti  2006 ; reeves 2006 ) .",
    "in the best objects where a very broad line is seen ( e.g. mcg6 - 30 - 15  fabian  2002 ; ngc4051  ponti  2006 ) the reflection appears to change little despite large variations in the continuum .",
    "the spectral variability can be decomposed into a highly variable power - law and a quasi - constant reflection component .",
    "this behaviour is also borne out by a difference ( high - low ) spectrum which is power - law in shape and the reflection - like shape of the spectrum of the intercept in flux - flux plots ( figs .",
    "this behaviour was initially puzzling , until the effects of gravitational light bending were included ( fabian & vaughan 2003 ; miniutti  2004 ; miniutti & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "recall that the extreme blurring in these objects means that much of the reflection occurs with a few @xmath4 of the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the enormous spacetime curvature there means that changes in the position of the primary power - law continuum have a large effect on the flux seen by an outside observer ( martocchia & matt 1996 ; martocchia  2002 ) .",
    "what this means is that an intrinsically constant continuum source can appear to vary by large amounts just be moving about in this region of extreme gravity .",
    "the reflection component , which comes from the spatially fixed accretion disc , appears relatively constant in flux in this region .",
    "consequently , the observed behaviour of these objects may just be a consequence of strong gravity .",
    "some of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies such as 1h0707 , iras13224 and 1h0439 appear to share this behaviour ( fabian  2002b , 2004 , 2005 ) and can be interpreted in terms of extreme light bending",
    ". some of these objects can show sharp drops around 7  kev that may be alternatively interpreted as due to absorption from something only partially covering the source ( boller et al 2002 ) .",
    "( if the covering was total then no strong soft emission would be seen , contrary to observation . )",
    "the gbh xtej1650 - 500 behaved in a manner similar to that expected from the light bending model ( rossi  2005 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from accreting black holes is expected to be polarized ( rees 1975 ) , with general relativistic effects influencing the degree and angle of polarization of emission from the innermost regions ( stark & connors 1977 ; doviak  2004 , fig .  8) .",
    "hopefully , a mission in the near future will carry a sensitive polarimeter so that this powerful information channel can be opened up .     on the left and @xmath12 on the right.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]   on the left and @xmath12 on the right.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "clear examples of relativistically - broadened iron lines are seen in some agn and gbh in some states .",
    "such objects must have dense inner accretion disks in order that the gas is not overionized .",
    "detection of a line is helped greatly if the iron abundance is super - solar and if there is little extra absorption due to very strong warm absorbers or winds . where broad lines are seen and can be modelled satisfactorally then the spin of the central black hole can be reliably determined .",
    "the study of absorption and emission variability of iron - k lines is in its infancy , with some interesting and tantalising results produced so far .",
    "the inner regions of accretion flows are bound to be structured and so give rise to variations .",
    "some may be due to motion or transience in the corona or primary power - law source while others may reflect structure , e.g. spiral waves , on the disk itself , intercepting primary radiation from much smaller radii .",
    "the number of broad lines detected is increasing and will continue to expand with the improved broad band coverage from suzaku .",
    "hints that broad lines are common in fainter objects such as in the lockman hole ( streblyanska  2005 ) and chandra deep fields ( brusa 2005 ) could indicate that the conditions necessary for strong line production , perhaps high metallicity , are common in typical agn at redshifts 0.51 .",
    "x - ray astronomers have an excellent tool with which to observe the innermost regions of accretion disks immediately around spinning black holes .",
    "the effects of redshifts and light bending expected from strong gravity in this regime are clearly evident .",
    "this can and should be exploited by future x - ray missions . to make significant progress we need large collecting areas .",
    "the count rate in the broad iron line of mcg6 - 30 - 15 is about 2  ph  m@xmath13  s@xmath6 , which means that square metres of collecting area are required around 6  kev in order to look for reverberation effects .",
    "gbh are much brighter but the orbital periods of matter close to the black hole are much , much smaller so reverberation is difficult here .",
    "instead , variations with mass accretion rate and source state are accessible .",
    "i am grateful to vladimr karas and giorgio matt for proposing and organising an interesting and successful symposium .",
    "i am also grateful to many colleagues for work on broad iron lines , including giovanni miniutti , jon miller , chris reynolds , andy young , kazushi iwasawa , randy ross , simon vaughan , luigi gallo , thomas boller , jamie crummy , josefin larsson , and to the royal society for continued support ."
