    "earlier studies showed that the region contains a number of o , b , and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the total mass of the association is about 30,000 m@xmath9 ( wright et al .",
    "the age of the cluster was estimated to be in the range 1 - 10 myr .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1995 ) gave an age of 1 - 4 myr and recently wright et al .",
    "( 2010 ) give its age as 3.5 - 5.3 myr .",
    "the association is a good laboratory to study star formation and stellar evolution , including the most advanced stages of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "hence , the association has been observed in @xmath10-ray , x - ray , uv , optical , ir , and radio wavelengths in numerous studies .",
    "nevertheless the interstellar medium affects the observations , especially in the uv and optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( rauw 2011 ) .",
    "the distance of the association has been calculated by various methods and these show differences .",
    "kiminki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) calculated the visual extinction ( @xmath11 ) as 5.4 mag and the distance modulus as 11.3 mag , by analyzing 146 ob systems .",
    "linder et al .",

    "different results derived by various methods exist ( see rauw 2011 ) .",
    "these discrepancies possibly reflect the differences between the methods used as well as the differences in the estimation of the visual extinction . in this study",

    "the binary system consists of two supergiant components .",
    "recently , kennedy et al . ( 2010 ) reported indirect evidence for the presence of a third body in with an orbital period of 6.7 years .",
    "the ubv light variations of the system were obtained by hall ( 1974 ) and later these light variations were used by leung & schneider ( 1978 ) to model its light curve using the wilson - devinney code ( wilson & devinney 1971 , hereafter w - d code ) .",
    "leung & schneider ( 1978 ) then calculated the orbital and physical parameters of the system by using bohannan & conti radial velocities .",
    "they gave the masses of the components as @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "vreux ( 1985 ) reported a periodic change in the h@xmath16 profile .",
    "rauw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured the radial velocities of the binary components and studied the emission line profile variations caused by the stellar wind interactions .",
    "they derived the mass functions for the components as @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the mass loss rate of the stellar winds as @xmath19/yr and @xmath20/yr .",
    "they gave the spectral types of the components as o6.5 - 7  ia+ofpe / wn9 .",

    "the authors estimated the masses of components as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , values with which we largely agree .",

    "( 1999 ) are analysed simultaneously and the orbital , physical parameters and the distance of the association are presented . following the observational information given in the second section , light and radial velocity models",
    "are presented in the third section and in the fourth section physical parameters of the binary system are calculated .",
    "the light variations of were observed in the bessel u , b , v , r and i bands over 65 nights between august 2010 and october 2011 .",
    "the observations were carried out at the tbitak national observatory ( tug ) with the 60 cm telescope , which was equipped with an fli ccd with @xmath23 pixel .",
    "comparison stars selected from the literature were gsc 3161 - 01269 and gsc 03161 - 01384 .",
    "a total of 272 , 417 , 451 , 281 , and 280 data points were obtained in u , b , v , r and i bands , respectively .",
    "the iraf ( digiphot / apphot ) packages were used in data reduction .",
    "the reduction and analysis of each frame are performed by subtracting the standard bias frames , dark frames , and dividing by flat - field frames , followed by aperture photometry . during the reduction",
    ", we have studied all the nights and each frame separately .",
    "standard deviations of the data are estimated as 0@xmath24.030 , 0@xmath24.010 , 0@xmath24.010 , 0@xmath24.008 , and 0@xmath24.009 for the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands , respectively .",

    "[ fig : lc - wd ] we plotted phase _ vs. _ relative flux instead of magnitudes . during data reduction",
    ", we used the linear ephemeris @xmath32 which is a reasonable approximation , over the last 40 years , to the quadratic ephemeris obtained over 115 yrs in the next section .",
    "subsequently the code gave an improved period of 6.597981 , which is still in good enough agreement with our quadratic ephemeris over the 40 yr time span .",
    "detection of times of minima of long period eclipsing binary systems like have relatively low probability .",
    "hence the times of minima of obtained during the last century are not as numerous as for other kinds of binaries . to search for",
    "the possible causes of observed period variations one should study their o - c variations ( o , observed ; c , calculated minima times ) .",
    "this variations can bear information about the origin of the orbital period variation . in this study , we collected all the minima times from the literature and list them in table  2 , along with the one obtained in this study .",
    "we have not included the minima times of the system given by kurochkin ( 1961 ) since they are given only to two digits and are highly scattered .",
    "the data in table  2 span over a 115 years , and so covers an important amount of time in the context of high - mass stellar evolution .",
    "the o - c variations show an upward parabolic trend .",
    "this indicates an increase in orbital period , which can occur when mass transfer takes place from the less massive star to the more massive one in a semidetached configuration ; but a period increase can also be expected if one or both components is losing mass to infinity through stellar wind in a detached configuration .",
    "in addition if a third body orbits the binary system there can be a long period high amplitude oscillation .",
    "however , the possibility of this is quite low since no such variation has been ever detected .",
    "a weighted least - squares method applied to the o - c timings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v729cyg : oc]a ) gives a quadratic solution :    @xmath33    the residuals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v729cyg : oc]b .",
    "this result indicates an orbital period variation on a timescale @xmath34 . we do not detect the third - body period of @xmath35 yrs suggested by kennedy et al ( 2010 )",
    "we have reduced the observed magnitude to relative flux before light variation analysis .",
    "we did a similar process to the hall ( 1974 ) ubv data .",
    "later we determined the weights by taking in to consideration the observational errors . according to this we determined the weights for u , b , v , r , and i filters respectively as 3.3 , 10 , 10 , 12.5 , and 11.1 .",
    "we used the phoebe ( prsa & zwitter 2005 ) program based on the w - d code . in the analysis the radial velocity data from rauw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , as well as the hall ( 1974 ) ubv observations and the ubvri observations obtained in this study were used .    during the analysis the temperature of the primary component , the limb darkening ( van hamme 1993 ) , albedos ( rucinski 1969 ) and gravity darkening ( von zeipel , 1924 ) are regarded as fixed parameters . the temperature of the primary component was assumed as either 36000  k from the spectral study of rauw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , or 32000  k. the latter value is appropriate for o9i ( cox 2000 ) .",
    "the time of minimum light @xmath36 , orbital period @xmath37 , orbital inclination @xmath38 , mass ratio @xmath39 , temperature of the secondary component @xmath40 , surface potentials @xmath41 , luminosities @xmath42(u ) , @xmath42(b ) , @xmath42(v ) , @xmath42(r ) , @xmath42(i ) , @xmath42(u1 ) , @xmath42(b1 ) , @xmath42(v1 ) are free parameters to be solved for .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : lc - results ] .",
    "the analysis indicates that the light contribution of the primary component is 86% in u , 85% in b , v and r , and 84% in the i - light curve , for our 32000k solution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc - wd ] the light curves computed with the resulting parameters are shown by solid lines .",

    "the filling factor , @xmath43 or 0.17 , is given by @xmath44 , and varies from zero to unity from the inner to the outer critical surface .",
    "this solution indicates that the system has a moderate degree of contact .",
    "the speed of the center of mass , @xmath45 , averages as @xmath46 . that the two components are best represented by",
    "somewhat different @xmath45 s probably represents the fact that winds from each component have different speeds , and so distort and shift the lines differently .",
    "although the colors such as b - v vary rather little round the orbit , as can be seen in fig .",
    "1a , the temperatures are required to differ because of the different geometries of the two eclipses .",
    "the physical parameters of listed in table  [ tab : phypar ] are determined from the parameters of table  [ tab : lc - results ] .",
    "the temperature of the sun was taken as 5777  k and its bolometric magnitude as 4.732 mag .    in order to obtain the absolute visual magnitude the bolometric corrections ( bc )",
    "are estimated from martins et al .",
    "the total magnitude of the system is taken as v=9.21 mag ( hall 1974 ) , and the individual magnitudes as 9.41 and 11.15 .",
    "the @xmath47 value ( 1.99 @xmath48 0.03 ) of the system was obtained from friedman et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . using the apparent magnitude of the system and the values quoted in table  [ tab : phypar ] ,",
    "we infer the distance of the system to be 967 @xmath48 48 pc .",
    "distance estimation from the binary parameters gives a result that is consistent with the other distance estimation techniques ( see section 1 ) .",
    "in this study we investigated the massive interacting close binary system by using our new and earlier published observations . radial velocity and light curves of the system",
    "were solved simultaneously , and the orbital and physical parameters obtained are shown in table  [ tab : lc - results ] and table  [ tab : phypar ] .",
    "our analysis shows that the system has a moderate contact configuration .    in their studies on x - ray and radio emission , linder et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and kennedy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) suggested that there is a third body with a period of 6.7 years orbiting the system from long - term vla observations .",
    "kennedy et al . ( 2010 ) estimated the mass function related to the third body as 3.2 @xmath49 . by using this mass function value and the physical parameters given in table  [ tab : phypar ] the mass of the third body for @xmath50=90@xmath51 , 70@xmath51 , 50@xmath51 ,",
    "30@xmath51 is obtained respectively as 24 @xmath49 , 26 @xmath49 , 35 @xmath49 , 68 @xmath49 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the uncertainty in these mass values is high because of the uncertainty in the mass function .",
    "single massive stars above an initial mass of @xmath52 are known to evolve towards an explosive supernova explosion ( smartt et al .",
    "2009 ) . leaving a neutron star or black hole remnant .",
    "however if a massive stars is a member of binary like its evolutionary path towards the final supernovae will become significantly different .",
    "the nature of the final stellar remnant may also be altered so that while a neutron star might be expected mass transfer may lead to black hole formation .",
