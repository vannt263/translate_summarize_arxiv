    "one would not expect that dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) in dense environments contain a significant interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "several arguments support this statement .",
    "supernova - explosions are able to transfer enough energy to the ism to heat it above the escape velocity in the least massive dwarfs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the frequent high - speed interactions with giant cluster - members to which a small late - type disk galaxy is subjected can transform it into a gasless spheroidal de - like object .",
    "this `` galaxy harassment '' process @xcite induces a dramatic morphological evolution on a time - span of about 3  gyr .",
    "moreover , hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies moving through the hot , thin intergalactic medium in clusters @xcite or groups @xcite show that ram - pressure stripping can completely remove the ism of a dwarf galaxy less massive than @xmath10 within a few 100 myrs .",
    "a quite different point of view on the origin of des comes to the same conclusion .",
    "if des are related to other dwarf galaxies such as blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) or dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) , the `` fading model '' conjectures that star - forming dwarf galaxies will fade and reach an end - state similar to present - day des after they have used up their gas supply and star - formation has ended @xcite .",
    "interactions may have sped up the gas - depletion process @xcite , explaining both the abundance of des and the paucity of bcds / dirrs in high - density environments .",
    "for all these reasons , des in dense environments were generally thought to be virtually gas - depleted systems .",
    "however , evidence is building up that at least some des have retained part of their gas . in their multi - wavelength study of the local group dwarf galaxies , young & lo",
    "presented vla hi observations of ngc147 , ngc185 , and ngc205 @xcite .",
    "these were the first observations that painted a detailed picture of the complex , multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) of the most nearby representatives of the class of the des @xcite .",
    "while ngc147 was not detected with a 3  @xmath0 mass upper limit of @xmath11 for an 8  km  s@xmath2 velocity width , ngc205 was found to contain @xmath12 of neutral hydrogen and the total hi mass of ngc185 was estimated at @xmath13 .",
    "the neutral ism of both detected galaxies turned out to be very clumpy , making a meaningful determination of their velocity fields rather difficult .",
    "still , the stars and hi gas in ngc205 seem to have different rotation velocities while in ngc185 , neither the hi or the stars show significant rotation @xcite .",
    "single - dish observations of @xmath14co emission provide evidence that the molecular and atomic gas are kinematically linked .",
    "ngc205 was not detected on h@xmath15[nii ] narrow - band images while ngc185 contains an extended emission region , about 50  pc across @xcite .",
    "more recently , hi surveys of the virgo cluster de population ( see conselice  et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein ) have shown that roughly 15% of the des contain a neutral ism . the detected hi masses range between 0.03 and @xmath16 .",
    "processes that remove gas , such as galaxy interactions and ram - pressure stripping @xcite , act most vigorously near the cluster center . accordingly , the gas - rich dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster tend to have positions towards the outskirts of the cluster , suggesting that they are recent acquisitions of the cluster or are moving on orbits that avoid the cluster center . in a spectroscopic survey of the fornax cluster , drinkwater et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered h@xmath6 emission in about 25% of the des .",
    "again , most of these galaxies lie towards the outskirts of the cluster , while des near the center of the cluster are generally devoid of ionized gas .    in this paper , we present new hi 21  cm line observations of two des , obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . with optical systemic velocities",
    "@xmath17  km / s ( fcc032 ) and @xmath18  km / s ( fcc336 ) @xcite , these des are bona fide members of the fornax cluster , located in the sparsely populated outskirts of the cluster ( see fig . [ cat ] ) . in section",
    "[ hi ] , we present our hi observations , followed by a discussion of our results in section [ disc ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "we have used the australia telescope compact array on 20 and 23 december 2004 to observe two des in the fornax cluster .",
    "we preferred interferometry observations above single - dish observations to avoid confusion with other galaxies that can be located within the large beam , which is a common nuisance in crowded environments such as the fornax cluster .",
    "the observations were made during night time to avoid solar rfi .",
    "we used the atca in the 1.5d configuration , with baselines ranging from 107  m to 4439  m. to be able to detect hi emission in three independent channels and since both sources had an estimated velocity width of about 50  km  s@xmath2 , we selected a correlator setup that yielded 512 channels of width 15.6  khz . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio the data were on - line hanning smoothed which resulted in a velocity resolution of @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 . at the start of each observation",
    "we observed the source 1934 - 638 as primary calibrator for 15 minutes .",
    "the source 0332 - 403 was observed every 40 minutes for 5 minutes as a secondary calibrator .",
    "the total integration time ( including calibration ) for each galaxy was 12h .",
    "the usual data reduction steps ( phase , amplitude and bandpass calibration ) were performed with the miriad package @xcite , the standard atca data analysis program .",
    "we subtracted the continuum by performing a first order fit to the visibilities over the line - free channels which were not affected by the edge effects of the band ( selected in advance by eye ) .",
    "the data cubes were created by using natural weighting and were subsequently smoothed with a gaussian beam of 1@xmath20 ( which corresponds to the optical spatial radius of our sources ) and off - line hanning smoothed to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "the final data cubes had a spectral resolution of @xmath21 km  s@xmath2 . due to the faintness of these objects",
    ", we did not attempt a deconvolution of our images .",
    "fcc032 was selected as a suitable target because it was known to contain a sizable ionised ism @xcite .",
    "this galaxy harbors a large ionised gas complex , about 850  pc across , containing star - formation regions and bubble - shaped gaseous filaments , probably supernova remnants .",
    "this offers strong evidence for recent or ongoing star formation in this de .",
    "our final data cube had a synthesised beam of @xmath22 due to the smoothing , resulting in a noise of 4  mjy / beam .",
    "these data cubes were inspected by eye for emission by plotting them over an optical image .",

    "smoothing was again applied to the data cube to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , resulting in a synthesised beam of @xmath37 and a noise of 4  mjy / beam . in a similar way as for fcc032 , we found weak emission in three channels near the optical systemic velocity .",
    "we summed the flux within a @xmath23 box centered on the central radio position of the galaxy , which again was derived by the total hi intensity map , ( see fig .",

    "we included only those galaxies in this diagram that were actually detected at 21  cm .",
    "many des , however , are too gas - poor to have been detected in hi at the distances of the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "hi studies in these clusters typically have mass - limits of the order of @xmath38 . only inside the local group have des and dsphs with a gas content as low as @xmath39 been detected .",
    "it should therefore be kept in mind that many des reside in the upper left part of this figure that have so far evaded detection .",

    "all these galaxies reside either in the virgo cluster or in the local group , with secure distance estimates @xcite .",

    "the local group dsphs and the local group des ngc185 and ngc205 ( both are satellites of m31 ) deviate from this sequence by being gas deficient .",

    "we overplotted the observed data points with theoretical predictions for the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 relation , based on the analytical models of pagel  &  tautvaiien ( 1998 ) for the chemical evolution of the large and small magellanic clouds . in the formalism of these models , galaxies are formed by the infall of pristine gas .",
    "stars are born at a rate proportional to the gas mass and supernova explosions eject gas at a rate proportional to the star - formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the build - up of the elemental abundances is calculated using the delayed - recycling approximation in order to include the contribution of snia .",
    "we used the b - band mass - to - light ratios of single - age @xmath47 , single - metallicity @xmath48 stellar populations ( or ssps ) , denoted by @xmath49 , presented by vazdekis  et al .",

    "the time - dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath48 is taken from pagel  &  tautvaiien ( 1998 ) ( their equations ( 6 ) , ( 8) , ( 11 ) , and ( 14 ) ) .",
    "the rightmost curve in fig .",
    "[ plotje ] , labeled with `` lmc '' , corresponds to parameter values fine - tuned to reproduce the elemental abundances observed in the lmc ( star - formation efficiency @xmath56  gyr@xmath2 and outflow parameter @xmath57 ) ; the middle curve , labeled with `` smc '' , corresponds to the smc ( star - formation efficiency @xmath58  gyr@xmath2 and outflow parameter @xmath59 ) .",
    "cleary , these simple models nicely reproduce the observed locus of the gas - rich dwarf late types , bcds , and des .",
    "the green curve in fig . [ plotje ] traces the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 relation of late - type galaxies predicted by semi - analytical models ( sams ) of galaxy formation via hierarchical merging in a @xmath60cdm universe @xcite .",
    "sams make use of a monte - carlo technique to construct the hierarchical merger tree that leads up to the formation of a galaxy of a given mass .",
    "they moreover contain prescriptions for star - formation , energy feedback from supernova explosions , gas cooling , tidal stripping , dust extinction , and the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas ejection . despite the inevitable oversimplifications in the description of immensely complex processes such as star formation",
    ", they are able to account pretty well for many observed properties of galaxies .",
    "the green curve in fig . [ plotje ] indicates the amount of cold gas present in simulated galaxies that were classified as late - types ( see also fig . 4 in nagashima & yoshii , 2004 ) .",
    "thus , it seems that the locus of gas - rich sd - sm - im galaxies and bcds in fig .",
    "[ plotje ] can be reproduced quite satisfactorily by chemical evolution models of isolated galaxies in which slow star formation does not exhaust all available gas within a hubble time .      using the same formalism , one can produce more gas - poor systems by raising the star - formation efficiency @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , interactions may have sped up the gas - depletion process @xcite , explaining both the abundance of gas - poor des and the paucity of gas - rich bcds / dirrs in high - density environments .",
    "e.g. , the leftmost curve in fig . [ plotje ] , labeled with `` enhanced sfr '' , corresponds to a model with a star - formation efficiency that is a factor of 3 higher than in the lmc model ( star - formation efficiency @xmath61  gyr@xmath2 and outflow parameter @xmath57 ) .",
    "this way , one can reproduce the locus of gas - poor dwarf galaxies such as the local group dwarf dsphs .",
    "all models presented in fig .",
    "[ plotje ] have luminosity - weighted mean metallicities in the range [ fe / h@xmath62=-0.65 $ ] to @xmath63 .",
    "the models with a high sfr consume their gas reservoir in a strong starburst at an early epoch , when the gas was not yet enriched with metals , and hence , even though they form stars more efficiently , do not have significantly higher mean metallicities than the low sfr models ( although they do contain a sprinkling of recently formed metalrich stars which are absent in low sfr models ) .",
    "as dicussed in grebel  et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , dsphs indeed have more metalrich red giants than dirrs and show evidence for a more vigorous early enrichment than dirrs .      raising the gas - ejection efficiency",
    "can also enhance the @xmath64 ratio although , at the same time , it significantly lowers the mean metallicity by effectively terminating further star - formation after the first star - forming event ( e.g. making the gas - ejection by supernovae 30 times as efficient as in the magellanic clouds leads to @xmath65 and [ fe / h@xmath62 \\approx -1.6 $ ] ) . however , the star - formation histories of the local group dsphs seem rather continuous ( with the exception of the carina dsph ) and show no evidence for major starbursts which would be able to expell significant amounts of gas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as argued by ferrara  &  tolstoy ( 2000 ) , maclow & ferrara ( 1999 ) , and de young & heckman ( 1994 ) , a centralised star - burst event in a round galaxy is much more efficient at transfering energy to the ism ( and hence at expelling gas out of a galaxy ) than a similar star - burst in a disk galaxy since , in the latter case , the hot supernova - driven gas can break through the disky ism along the minor axis .",
    "hence , this suggests that rotationally flattened galaxies , such as dwarf late - types , indeed have lower gas - ejection efficiencies than des and dsphs .",
    "the metallicity - flattening relation observed in des @xcite , with more flattened des tending to be less metal - rich , seems to indicate that in flattened des , individual supernova - explosions or star - formation sites are better able to eject the hot , enriched gas via a chimney perpendicular to the disk , without appreciably affecting the surrounding ism , than in round des .",
    "this leads to flattening as a second parameter in controlling a de s metallicity besides total mass .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies moving through the hot , rarefied intracluster medium show that ram - pressure stripping can completely remove the ism of a low - mass dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "interactions and ram - pressure stripping are most efficient at removing gas from galaxies near the cluster center . indeed , the gas - rich dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster tend to have positions towards the outskirts of the cluster ( e.g. conselice  et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) , suggesting that they are recent acquisitions of the cluster or are moving on orbits that avoid the cluster center . in a spectroscopic survey of the fornax cluster , drinkwater et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered h@xmath6 emission in about 25% of the des .",
    "again , most of these galaxies lie towards the cluster periphery , while des near the center of the cluster are generally devoid of ionized gas .",
    "likewise , both hi - rich des presented in this paper are located in the sparsely populated outskirts of the fornax cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ cat ] ) .",
    "based on our hi 21  cm observations of des in the fornax cluster and on hi 21  cm observations of des , bcds , and late - type dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite , and the local group dwarfs , we conclude that the gas - content of the most gas - rich dwarf galaxies is consistent with a continuous , slow star - formation history .",
    "after one hubble time , these galaxies still have a large gas reservoir left and roughly trace a sequence defined by the relation @xmath66 .",
    "however , the majority of the dwarf spheroidals and dwarf ellipticals contain significantly less gas than predicted by this relation .",
    "external gas - removal mechanisms such as a star - formation rate enhanced by gravitational interactions or ram - pressure stripping can account very well for the existence of these gas - poor systems .",
    "such external mechanisms will act most vigorously in high - density environments , offering a natural explanation for the trend for hi mass to increase with distance from the nearest massive galaxy @xcite , and the fact that gas - rich des are observed predominantly in the outskirts of clusters .",
