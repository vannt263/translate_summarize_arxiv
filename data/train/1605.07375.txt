    "the nonclassical properties of light have been for a long time the main topic of interest in quantum optics .",
    "the question whether a given quantum state is nonclassical ( i.e. , can not be treated by the classical statistical theory ) has been considered as one of the most important problems since the early days of quantum physics  @xcite ( for a review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for optical fields , a commonly accepted criterion for distinguishing nonclassical states from the classical ones is expressed as follows  @xcite : a quantum state is nonclassical if its glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function fails to have all the properties of a probability density .",
    "we recall that the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function for an @xmath1-mode bosonic state @xmath2 can be defined as  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is given in terms of the @xmath5th - mode coherent state @xmath6 , which is the eigenstate of the @xmath5th - mode annihilation operator @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes complex multivariable @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that the negativity of the @xmath0 function is necessary and sufficient for nonclassicality , while the singularity or irregularity of the @xmath0 function is only a sufficient condition ( i.e. , it is a nonclassical witness ) .",
    "thus , if the @xmath0 function is more singular or more irregular than dirac s @xmath11-function for a given state , then it is also nonpositive ( semidefinite ) in the formalism of generalized functions .",
    "a standard example of such irregular functions is the @xmath0 function for an @xmath12-photon fock state ( with @xmath13 ) , which is given by the @xmath12th derivative of @xmath14 .",
    "based on this definition of nonclassicality , various operational criteria ( also called witnesses ) have been described for testing the nonclassicality of single - mode  @xcite and multi - mode  @xcite ] fields .",
    "their derivations are based either on the fields moments  @xcite or exploit the bochner theorem written for the characteristic function of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function  @xcite .",
    "a direct reconstruction of the quasi - distributions of integrated intensities is a sufficient but not necessary condition of the nonclassicality of the detected fields by the definition  @xcite .",
    "we note that nonclassicality criteria derived from the majorization theory have also been found useful  @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two optical fields is one of the most frequently studied forms of nonclassical light .",
    "such light emerges in various two - mode or multimode nonlinear optical processes , e.g. , in spontaneous parametric down - conversion . in this process",
    ", pairs of photons composed of the signal and idler modes are created at the expense of the annihilated pump photons .",
    "this pairwise character of emitted light lies in the heart of entanglement here .",
    "the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion has its degenerate variant called second - subharmonic generation , where both photons in a pair are emitted into the same optical mode .",
    "this gives raise to phase squeezing of the second - subharmonic field composed of , in general , many photon pairs .",
    "the squeezed light is also considered nonclassical as it has its phase fluctuations suppressed below the classical limit .",
    "the nonclassicality in both cases has the same origin which is pairing of photons . on the other side ,",
    "the emitted photon pairs can be manipulated by linear optics . in detail ,",
    "two photons from one pair present in the same mode of a squeezed state of light can be split ( on a beam splitter ) and contribute to the entanglement of the output fields .",
    "also , two photons from a pair incident on different input ports of a beam splitter can `` stick together '' ( bunch ) and leave the beam splitter in the same output port ( as testified in the hong - ou - mandel interferometer  @xcite ) .",
    "the interconnection of these two types of fields by the means of linear optics has already been shown by braunstein  @xcite and later elaborated by adesso @xcite for arbitrarily strong gaussian states .",
    "this behavior poses a natural question whether it is possible to introduce a physical quantity that quantifies `` a nonclassicality resource '' present during the creation of both types of fields and later conserved during linear - optical transformations .",
    "the answer to this question is intimately related to the quantifiers of _ entanglement _ and _ local nonclassicality_. several measures were proposed to quantify the entanglement in both discrete and continuous domains  @xcite .",
    "the negativity ( or its logarithmic variant ) is considered , probably , as the most useful at present . on the other hand , the lee nonclassicality depth  @xcite",
    "is conventionally used to quantify the nonclassicality of optical fields .",
    "alternatively , the nonclassicality of an optical field can be transcribed to entanglement using a beam splitter and quantified via an entanglement measure  @xcite . for a comparative study of these two nonclassicality measures",
    "see , e.g. , recent refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that , apart from the local nonclassicalities of two parts of a bipartite state , also _ global nonclassicality _ can naturally be defined .",
    "all these three quantities have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite for intense multi - mode twin beams with the following result : whenever a twin beam is entangled it is globally nonclassical . on the other hand ,",
    "its signal and idler constituents are multi - thermal and so locally classical .",
    "a general approach for describing the relation between the entanglement and global nonclassicality of two - mode states has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "we construct such an invariant for general two - mode gaussian states arising in nonlinear processes described by the second order susceptibility @xmath15 .",
