    "among the wide variety of quantum chemistry methods proposed in the last decade , a great fascination resides in the possibility to combine density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite and explicit many - body correlation methods , such as second - order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) perturbation theory,@xcite random - phase approximations ( rpa)@xcite and coupled - cluster theory.@xcite the hope is to get the best out of both worlds , that is to combine a proper description of long - range dispersion interactions ( without introduction of empirical corrections@xcite ) and a good description of short - range electron correlations with a reduced dependence on the basis set .",
    "different ways to combine dft and wave - function techniques have been proposed .",
    "these include global double - hybrid approaches@xcite and range - separated approaches.@xcite in this work we focused on the latter type , which was initially introduced by stoll and savin in the 80s.@xcite it has been shown that for molecular complexes ( and especially for dimers involving rare - gas atoms ) it provides excellent performance as regards bond lengths , dissociation energies , and harmonic frequencies . in many cases ,",
    "results are , quote , `` superior , with medium - size basis sets , to pure dft and pure coupled - cluster calculations''.@xcite    concerning the study of solids , we note that the introduction of wave - function - based correlation treatment for periodic systems is relatively recent.@xcite martinez - casado and coworkers proposed to estimate the correlation energy as a mp2 contribution using a b3lyp reference state , and applied this scheme to the study of the adsorption of helium atoms on a mgo surface.@xcite del ben and coworkers@xcite benchmarked the performance of some global double hybrids on a set of molecular crystals . in particular , these authors used the dsd - blyp functional,@xcite that includes a spin - component - scaled ( scs)@xcite mp2 contribution .",
    "recently , some of us applied one - parameter double - hybrid methods to molecular crystals.@xcite    in this work , we tested the performance of range - separated double - hybrid methods ,  @xcite combining short - range density - functional approximations with long - range mp2 correlation , for evaluating the cohesive energy of crystalline periodic systems .",
    "we implemented this approach in the crystal@xcite and cryscor@xcite programs , that use a basis set of gaussian - type orbitals centred on atoms .",
    "the mp2 correlation part is treated within a local approach , where the pair - specific virtual space is spanned by projected atomic orbitals ( paos ) , restricted to the so - called domains , i.e. several atoms surrounding the considered localized occupied orbitals .",
    "this technique was initially proposed by pulay in the 80s,@xcite and extended by werner , schtz and coworkers to high - level correlated methods for molecules.@xcite the adaptation of the local mp2 method to periodic systems has been done in the last decade , @xcite and over the years has been successfully applied to quite a rich variety of systems.@xcite    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : methods ] , a review of the formal aspects of the methods and their extension to periodic systems is given .",

    "this originates from some benchmark on molecular systems , and is justified under the consideration that @xmath9 should correspond to the inverse of the average distance between valence electrons ( _ i.e. _ twice the seitz radius , giving around 1 - 2 bohr in valence regions).@xcite    solids exhibit a wider variety of chemical bonds with respect to molecular complexes : dispersion interactions , ionic , covalent , and metallic bond ( the latter we can not deal with , using the approaches presented in this work ) .",

    "crystal , the cohesive energy is quite dependent on the basis set .",
    "it stems from the expected strong basis set dependence of the mp2 part , but also from the basis set dependence of the dft part which is even stronger for this system .",
    "the latter can be probably explained by the very small scale of the interaction energy ( of an order of just a kj / mol ) and a delicate balance between dispersion attraction and exchange repulsion which needs to be captured in a proper way . at the same time , for any given basis set , the energy is almost independent of @xmath9 above @xmath109 . in particular , with the largest basis set ( p - aug - cc - pvqz ) , rshpbe+mp2 gives an accurate cohesive energy for @xmath110 .",
    "for the other two systems , the basis set dependence is virtually negligible at the scale of the interaction energy , provided the polarization - augmented basis sets are used . for the co@xmath83 crystal ( middle panel of figure [ fig : mudep ] ) , the curves of the cohesive energy exhibit a minimum at @xmath111 for all basis sets . near this minimum",

    "the effect of the diffuse basis functions on the rshpbe+mp2 cohesive energy is important for @xmath110 and seems converged with the p - aug - cc - pvdz basis set .",
    "for @xmath112 the role of many - body correlation effects , not included in the exchange - correlation functional , becomes insignificant and the impact of augmentation of the basis set becomes very small .",
    "for the lih crystal , the cohesive energy curves are quite flat between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , with a minimum at around @xmath115 . near the minimum",
    ", rshpbe+mp2 gives an accurate cohesive energy with basis sets larger than the cc - pvdz basis set .    in figure",
    "[ fig : decomp ] the decomposition of the rshpbe+mp2/p - aug - cc - pvdz cohesive energy curves of figure [ fig : mudep ] in individual rshpbe and mp2 contributions is reported .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the absolute value of the mp2 contribution increases for ne and co@xmath83 when increasing @xmath9 from 0.1 to about 0.5 , and then saturates . for lih ,",
    "the absolute value of the mp2 contribution increases almost linearly as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this can be rationalized in the following way . by increasing the @xmath9 parameter ,",
    "one progressively includes more short - range mp2 correlation . for small values of @xmath9",
    "it still means adding more dispersion , leading to progressive growth of the magnitude of the attractive mp2 contribution .",
    "however , at some point , @xmath9 becomes so large , that the short - range intra - molecular mp2 component of the interaction energy , which is usually repulsive in molecular crystals,@xcite starts contributing .",
    "further on it even outruns the short - range dispersion , whose accumulation slows down due to the packing effects , and the mp2 contribution curve for ne and co@xmath83 turns into a slightly decaying regime .",
    "in contrast to the molecular crystals , for lih the short - range correlation is stabilizing ( correlation substantially strengthens binding even in lih molecule@xcite ) , so in this system the magnitude of the mp2 contribution always grows with increase of the @xmath9 parameter .    from the present results , we conclude that the value of @xmath0 is reasonable for the solids considered .",
    "hence , as a conservative choice based on previous experience on molecular systems , we chose this value of @xmath9 for the wider benchmark of the range - separated double hybrids carried out in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "notably , for that value of @xmath9 , range - separated double hybrids show a similar basis set dependence as full mp2 for the basis sets considered here .",

    "the mean absolute relative errors ( mares ) also confirm this trend , with the exception of pure lda which gives better cohesive energies for ar and co@xmath83 with the cc - pvdz basis set compared to the other methods , leading to the smallest mare despite being less accurate than the other methods for ionic and semiconducting crystals . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the large difference in behavior on individual systems observed between pure lda and pbe is greatly smoothened in the range - separated double hybrids which yield similar results for the two density functionals . yet , on average , the pbe - based range - separated double hybrids gives slightly more accurate cohesive energies than the lda - based ones .",
