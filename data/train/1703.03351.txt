    "<S> the edge modes can be seen as modes spanning between different energy bands . in a finite system , to obtain a similar measure of whether any given mode has a chiral edge conductivity associated with it , we define a _ quasi - momentum _ following a similar approach to @xcite : when an excitation hops from site to site , it accumulates a phase . if this phase of hopping is constant around the edge of the lattice , the hopping occurs around the edge in a given direction . </S>",

    "<S> this is in contrast to what one might expect from the equilibrium bulk analysis , where the edge state conductivity , proportional to the sum of the chern numbers of the filled lower lying bands , is the same for both states ( i ) and ( ii ) [ see the red line in fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , we find that while in the case ( i ) the dissipation makes the excitation decay after only a few sites , when exciting the edge state ( ii ) the excitation becomes sub - radiant , i.e. , it decays with a rate much smaller than the single atom decay rate @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have found the existence of topologically non - trivial phases in a dense atomic two - dimensional lattice system coupled to the radiation field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can excite edge states that allow for the transport of an excitation over long distances along the edge of the lattice that are robust to the presence of defects . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these edge states are remarkably long - lived due to the collective character of the dissipation ( a detailed analysis of this effect will be the aim of further investigations ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have found that , due to the long - range character of the interactions , the bulk - boundary relations , well established for topological insulators with short - range interactions , are not generally valid in our setting .    </S>",
