    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is currently the leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the mssm predicts five physical higgs bosons : a charged pair ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , two cp  even scalars ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) , and a cp  odd pseudoscalar @xmath4 .",
    "to date their detection remains elusive despite intense searches at past and present colliders .",
    "lower limits on their masses have been derived , which assume certain decay modes and apply to specific regions of the mssm parameter space @xcite .",
    "lep ii has the strongest lower limits on the masses of all the above higgs bosons . in the case of @xmath6 , limits from the tevatron run i can be competitive in specific regions of parameter space ( small and large @xmath14)@xcite .",
    "lep carries out searches in the channels @xmath15 and obtains the mass limits @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 gev , for @xmath18 @xcite . in the framework of the mssm , these mass limits enable indirect bounds on @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be derived which are stronger than the direct search limits for these particles @xcite . for example",
    ", @xmath21 gev implies @xmath22 gev , which is stronger than the direct bound @xmath23 gev .",
    "the above mass bounds are obtained for @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the region of @xmath24 in which the mass bounds are considerably weakened . in particular , a very light",
    "@xmath4 ( @xmath5 gev ) has not been excluded by direct searches @xcite .",
    "the mssm with @xmath24 is not strictly the minimal model since it calls for a new physics scale below the gut scale where the top ",
    "quark yukawa coupling becomes strongly interacting .",
    "we nevertheless advocate consideration of the @xmath25 parameter space for the following reasons :    * theoretical studies and searches for the higgs bosons of the general two  higgs doublet model consider @xmath26 @xcite . in such models",
    "one usually imposes the milder requirement that the top ",
    "quark yukawa coupling is perturbative at the weak scale , corresponding to @xmath27 @xcite . *",
    "a very light pseudoscalar is a necessary condition for spontaneous cp violation in the mssm @xcite i.e. the existence of a relative phase between the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "point ( ii ) is of particular interest since spontaneous cp violation has been considered ruled out in the mssm for years due to the progressively stronger mass bound on @xmath28 for @xmath18 .",
    "however , spontaneous cp violation might be possible in the unexcluded region of low @xmath14 and light @xmath28 ( despite a possible new physics threshold much below the gut scale ) , thus motivating experimental consideration of this region .",
    "a very light @xmath4 is not ruled out for @xmath26 because the standard search strategies which rely on @xmath29 tagging the decays @xmath30 or @xmath31 become ineffective . in the @xmath24 region",
    "the decay @xmath32 becomes increasingly important @xcite , thus suppressing br@xmath33 ) .",
    "the subsequent decay @xmath34 has a sizeable branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath26 and/or @xmath35 and so suppresses br@xmath36 ) , giving rise to topologies of @xmath37 ( from @xmath1 ) or @xmath38 ( from @xmath39 .",
    "these final states elude the standard lep searches , resulting in unexcluded regions in the ( @xmath2 ) plane @xcite .",
    "the existence of a very light @xmath4 in the mssm requires a light @xmath6 with @xmath40 80 gev , which may violate constraints on @xmath19 from other experiments e.g. i ) direct searches at lep ii and the tevatron run i , and ii ) the indirect effect of @xmath6 on flavour changing neutral current processes ( fcnc ) and electroweak precision measurements .",
    "thus in the framework of the mssm the unexcluded region of very light @xmath4 may be probed by searching for a light @xmath6 .",
    "we will show that the direct searches for @xmath6 would be affected by the presence of a large br for @xmath41 , and therefore such a @xmath6 may not be ruled out from current searches .",
    "however , the indirect effect of @xmath6 on electroweak observables which are sensitive to corrections to the @xmath42 vertex is very pronounced , and a light @xmath6 with @xmath26 is strongly disfavoured by lep electroweak precision data .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we evaluate the br(@xmath41 ) in the region of ( @xmath43 ) unexcluded by direct searches .",
    "section 3 considers the indirect effect of a light @xmath6 at low @xmath14 on electroweak precision observables , while section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the neutral higgs boson searches at lep in the channels @xmath44 and @xmath1 exclude regions in the ( @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "there are three benchmark scenarios used in the lep searches :    * no mixing case : defined by @xmath45 * maximum @xmath46 case : defined by @xmath47 * large @xmath48 case    in these scenarios all susy parameters are fixed",
    ". in scenario ( i ) an unexcluded region in the ( @xmath2 ) plane still remains for @xmath5 gev and @xmath49 gev@xmath50 gev , provided @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to the region where the decay chain @xmath52 is important .    in the following subsections we shall study the phenomenology of @xmath6 corresponding to the region unexcluded by direct searches for @xmath12 and @xmath4 , which predicts @xmath53 gev for @xmath54 .",
    "it should be noted that there are sizeable corrections to the tree level sum rule , @xmath55  @xcite , and @xmath19 can be as light as 69 ( 73 ) gev for @xmath56",
    ". in this region there exists the following mass hierarchy , @xmath57 which differs from the usual higgs mass hierarchy @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 gev .",
    "we will show results for the no mixing case , using the lep values @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 tev .      in the parameter space of low @xmath14 and small @xmath28",
    "the three body decay @xmath63 is sizeable . in fig .",
    "1 we show br@xmath64 ) as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "one observes that br@xmath65 can be as large as 60% ( 45% ) for @xmath54 .",
    "note that these brs are larger than those presented in @xcite since this paper used @xmath66 and the ( then ) bound @xmath67 gev .",
    "lep ii searches for @xmath68 and has derived limits on @xmath19 as a function of br@xmath69 ) , with the most conservative limit being @xmath70 gev @xcite .",
    "the searches assume br@xmath71+br@xmath72 .",
    "the large br@xmath65 in the parameter space of interest would weaken the existing limits on @xmath19 , allowing @xmath73 gev for @xmath54 i.e. the prediction for @xmath19 in the unexcluded region .",
    "investigation of the impact of @xmath74 decays on the mssm @xmath6 searches at lep is in progress , and a preliminary search @xcite for such decays has been performed in the context of the 2hdm ( model i ) , where br(@xmath41 ) can reach @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "however , this search also required @xmath29tagging and is only valid for @xmath76 and large br@xmath77 .      the tevatron run i searched for @xmath78 decays and rules out regions of the ( @xmath79 ) plane which would correspond to values of br@xmath80 ) incompatible with the observed events in @xmath81 production .",
    "the exact boundary of the excluded region depends sensitively on the theoretical cross section , @xmath82 ) , with the most conservative excluded region occurring for larger theoretical cross  section .",
    "the region @xmath83 gev and @xmath51 has been ruled out at @xmath84 cl @xcite .    in the low @xmath14 region , where @xmath85 is normally assumed to be the dominant channel , the contribution of @xmath86 decays would cause a deficit in the expected number of leptonic ( @xmath87 ) decays of the top ( @xmath88 ) , thus giving a worse fit to the data . the suppression of br(@xmath89 by @xmath90 ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) would be sufficient to shift the boundary of the excluded region to lower values of @xmath14 , thus narrowly permitting @xmath7 and @xmath91",
    ". the new decay channel can give rise to the observed final states via @xmath92 .",
    "this was pointed out in @xcite and @xcite which concentrated on the region @xmath18 and @xmath21 gev . with 2 fb@xmath93 of data at the tevatron run ii ,",
    "the region @xmath83 gev and @xmath94 will be ruled out at @xmath84 cl@xcite .",
    "therefore this scenario of very light @xmath95 and light @xmath6 will be excluded or confirmed directly in @xmath78 decays very soon .",
    "the previous section showed that the unexcluded region from the searches for @xmath1 and @xmath44 corresponds to a light @xmath6 which itself would have narrowly escaped detection in direct searches due to the large br@xmath65 .",
    "it is known that a light @xmath6 and low @xmath14 would have large effects on various rare @xmath96 or @xmath97 meson decays as well as the electroweak precision measurements . in the following subsections",
    "we address the compatibility of @xmath7 and @xmath98 with these indirect constraints .      owing to the large top quark yukawa coupling",
    ", a light @xmath6 with @xmath3 would contribute strongly to processes like @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 mixing , through top quark exchange diagrams @xcite .",
    "however , contributions to these processes from supersymmetric particles depend strongly on the flavour structure of the mssm which is completely arbitrary .",
    "it is known that the @xmath6 contribution to @xmath102 can interfere destructively with the chargino contribution depending on the sign of @xmath103 , @xmath48 and the mass insertion parameter @xmath104 in the up squark sector , @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the unconstrained mssm allows for gluino mediated @xmath105 transitions with arbitrary coupling strength @xmath106 @xcite , which can be chosen to cancel any large contribution from @xmath6 .",
    "given the possibility of fcncs mediated by supersymmetric particles we conclude that no definite constraints on @xmath6 can be derived from these processes .",
    "stringent constraints on a light @xmath6 are obtained from electroweak precision measurements , i.e. the @xmath107-pole observables from lep1 and slc , and the @xmath108 mass from tevatron and lep2 .",
    "the @xmath107-pole observables consist of 8 line - shape parameters @xmath109 , two asymmetries from the @xmath110-polarization data ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , the decay rates and the asymmetries of @xmath29- and @xmath113-quarks ( @xmath114 ) and the asymmetries measured at slc @xmath115 .",
    "we use the experimental data of these observables reported at the 2001 summer conference@xcite . taking account of the @xmath116 data from tevatron@xcite , the qcd coupling @xmath117@xcite and the qed coupling @xmath118@xcite at the @xmath119-mass scale , we find that the sm best fit gives @xmath120 ( 9% cl ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs bosons in the mssm affect these electroweak observables through the radiative corrections to the gauge boson two - point functions ( oblique corrections ) , and the vertex and box corrections . among them ,",
    "the @xmath121 vertex is most sensitive to small @xmath28 ( i.e. , small @xmath19 ) and small @xmath14 through the charged higgs boson and the top quark exchange , since the coupling @xmath122-@xmath123-@xmath6 is proportional to @xmath124 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the total @xmath125 as a function of @xmath28 for various values of @xmath14 .",
    "four thick lines correspond to @xmath126 , 0.6 , 0.7 and 1 .",
    "the thick - dashed horizontal line denotes the minimum @xmath125 in the sm ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the experimentally unexcluded @xmath4 mass is @xmath128 gev for @xmath129 @xcite ( for the no mixing scenario that we consider ) .",
    "it is easy to see that small @xmath130 leads to a significantly large @xmath125 ( @xmath131 for @xmath132 gev ) due to the enhancement of the @xmath122-@xmath123-@xmath6 coupling which sizeably affects the partial decay width of @xmath133 .",
    "the observables which are sensitive to @xmath134 are @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for example , for @xmath138 and @xmath139 gev which corresponds to @xmath140 gev ,",
    "the deviations of these three observables from the experimental data are @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , while the sm best fit gives @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "the total @xmath125 for @xmath24 is almost flat for @xmath147  gev .",
    "this is because only @xmath6 sizeably contributes to the electroweak observables for @xmath24 , and @xmath19 varies little with @xmath28 in this range . since the fit shows @xmath148 for small @xmath28 and small @xmath14 , the possibility of a very light @xmath4 is strongly disfavoured from electroweak precision measurements .    in the context of a non - supersymmetric two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm )",
    "we note that a very light @xmath4 ( even @xmath149 gev ) is still consistent with electroweak precision data @xcite .",
    "this is because the masses of the higgs bosons in the 2hdm are free parameters ( in contrast to the mssm ) and thus a very light @xmath4 does not require the other higgs bosons to be light .",
    "the direct searches at lep ii for the neutral higgs bosons @xmath4 and @xmath12 of the mssm fail to exclude a light @xmath4 in the region of @xmath24 .",
    "the mass of @xmath6 is predicted to be @xmath150 gev for @xmath54 , with a large branching ratio for @xmath90 .",
    "the latter decay ensures that @xmath6 would have escaped the lep searches , which rely on @xmath151 decays .",
    "such a @xmath6 would have also have ( narrowly ) escaped detection at run i of the tevatron in the channel @xmath78 , which is very sensitive to the region @xmath83 gev and @xmath26 . the large br@xmath64 )",
    "shifts the excluded region to lower values of @xmath14 , thus allowing @xmath6 in the parameter space of interest .",
    "run ii will comfortably detect or rule out the region of @xmath152 and @xmath153 gev , which in turn would directly confirm or rule out the possibility of a light @xmath4 ( @xmath154 gev ) .",
    "such a @xmath6 would sizeably affect several low energy processes ( @xmath155 decays ) and electroweak precision measurements at lep1 and slc .",
    "since the former are very sensitive to the ( unknown ) flavour structure of the mssm , no definite constraints on @xmath6 can be derived .",
    "however , we showed that @xmath156 and @xmath26 is strongly disfavoured by electroweak precision data , giving rise to exceedingly large @xmath125 values .",
    "thus we conclude that the region of very light @xmath4 and @xmath26 , although unexcluded by direct searches , is severely disfavoured by indirect constraints and will be probed directly in @xmath78 decays at the tevatron run ii .",
