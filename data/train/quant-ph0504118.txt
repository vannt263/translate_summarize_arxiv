    "quantum effects can highlight the thermodynamic differences between classical and quantum working substance of a heat engine .",
    "recently , great efforts @xcite has been devoted to the investigation of the quantum effect of the working substance .",
    "some exotic phenomena were discovered , most of which concerns the following three aspects : the first aspect is whether we can improve the efficiency of the qhe to a level beyond the classical limit .",
    "for example , m. o. scully et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a quantum - electrodynamic heat engine that can exceed the maximum limit by using the photon gas as working substance .",
    "the second aspect is how we can better the work extraction during a carnot cycle .",
    "t. d. kieu present a new type of qhe @xcite , in which the contact time is precisely controlled ( without reaching thermal equilibrium ) and the two heat baths are specifically modified .",
    "this qhe can extract more work than the other model in thermal equilibrium case .",
    "the third aspect is about the constraints of the temperatures of the two heat baths , under which positive work can be extracted .",
    "it is clear that a classical heat engine can extract positive work when and only when @xmath0 . here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the temperatures of the source and the sink .",
    "but for a qhe , some exotic phenomena may occur .",
    "one example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which positive work can be extracted even from a single heat bath , i.e. , @xmath3 ; another example is the simplest 2-level qhe model in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which positive work can be extracted only when @xmath4 is greater than @xmath2 to a certain extent .",
    "we consider the third aspect in detail . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the qhe works between the source and sink at temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . within a cycle , the level spacing @xmath5 changes between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for such a qhe , the system couples to the bath for a sufficiently long time until they reach the thermal equilibrium state . then positive work can be performed when and only when @xmath8 ( condition @xmath9 ) .",
    "this result implies a broad validity of the second law and shows by how much @xmath1 should be greater * *  * * than @xmath2 such that the positive work can be extracted .",

    "now we wonder whether it is a universal condition for all multi - level qhe .",
    "actually t. d. kieu has considered two special cases , the simple harmonic oscillator and the infinite square well , in ( the appendices of ) ref . @xcite . as to the two special cases , because all the level spacings change in the same ratio , the pwc has the same form as that for a 2-level case @xcite . in this article , we will prove that the pwc for a 3-level qhe can be looser compared to a 2-level case under our criterion when the level spacings change properly in the thermodynamic cycle .",
