    "<S> the question of how long it takes for quantum particles to tunnel through a potential barrier has attracted considerable attention for many decades @xcite . theoretical investigations @xcite and experimental researches @xcite have shown that the traversal time defined by group delay , also known as the phase time in the literature @xcite , which describes the motion of a wave packet peak @xcite , has the well - known superluminality . </S>",
    "<S> though the group delay for quantum particles tunneling through a potential barrier depends on the barrier thickness for thin barriers , it is saturated to a constant for thick barriers . </S>",
    "<S> this is known as the  hartman effect \" @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , superluminal propagation was also theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally verified @xcite for light pulses through anomalous dispersion media .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the mechanism for superluminal traversal time remains controversial to the present day @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> wang and zhang @xcite attributed the superluminal traveling in the skc experiment @xcite to the reshaping due to the interference between uncertain path modes . </S>",
    "<S> japha and kurizki @xcite demonstrated , by use of the impulse response function , that the destructive interference between accessible causal paths plays a key role in superluminal time delays . </S>",

    "<S> more recently , martinez @xcite investigated the origin of hartman effect by the interference between the evanescent waves in the region of barrier .    in this letter , we give a clear picture of the reshaping mechanism of the transmitted wave packet to explain the superluminal traversal time . </S>",
    "<S> the reshaping of the whole transmitted wave packet results from the coherent interference between its different constituents , which are not plane wave components but all finite temporal wave packets , and arise from multiple reflections inside the well or barrier . in the case of potential - well traveling </S>",

    "<S> we also show that the reshaping does not change the profile of the wave packet as long as a condition is satisfied . on the other hand , in the case of potential - barrier tunneling that is classically forbidden , </S>",
    "<S> each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a time that is independent of the barrier thickness .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the traversal time of quantum particles through a one - dimensional rectangular potential well of depth @xmath0 , extending from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a temporal wave packet can be expressed in terms of plane wave components as @xmath3 d\\omega$ ] , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the mass of the particle , and @xmath7 is the energy . for a gaussian - shaped incident wave packet </S>",

    "<S> [ comparison1].,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the contrary , when the condition ( [ restriction - a ] ) is not satisfied , numerical calculations have shown that the transmitted wave packet is distorted significantly , due to the fact that the absolute value and phase of transmission coefficient do not linearly depend on @xmath37 in the interval in which the spectral distribution , @xmath32 , is appreciable . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the concept of group delay in this case is no longer applicable .    </S>",

    "<S> each of the wave packet constituents , @xmath78 , is delayed from the incident wave packet by a time that is independent of the barrier thickness . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the magnitude of each of @xmath77 is decayed from that of its preceding counterpart by a factor @xmath79 .    when the barrier is thin in comparison with the penetration depth , @xmath80 , the time delay of the whole transmitted wave packet depends on the barrier thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is rooted in the interference between the multiple transmitted constituents . </S>",
    "<S> when the barrier is thick enough , @xmath81 , each of transmitted constituents is very small and can be neglected in comparison with its preceding one , although the interference between them still exists . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the whole transmitted wave packet in this case is approximately equal to the first transmitted constituent , @xmath82 so the traversal time is equal to the time delay of the first transmitted constituent , and is given by , in terms of the phase of @xmath83 , @xmath84 it is obviously independent of the barrier thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion results from the fact that no phase accumulates in the barrier region , and the phase shift only comes from the boundary of barrier @xcite . all those amount to manifest the nature of hartman effect in barrier tunneling .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , the superluminal traversal time of a quantum wave packet through a potential well has been explained by the mechanism of reshaping due to the interference between its successively transmitted wave packet constituents that arise from the multiple reflections inside the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> a physical condition was advanced that is required for the transmitted wave packet to maintain the shape of incident wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism was further used to show the nature of hartman effect in barrier tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the reshaping mechanism of wave packets discussed here is also applicable to other phenomena , such as the goos - hnchen displacement in frustrated total internal reflection @xcite and the anomalous lateral displacement @xcite of light beam transmitted through a thin slab of optically thick medium . </S>"
