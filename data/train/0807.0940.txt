    "the most abundant molecule in the cosmos , h@xmath1 , has no permanent dipole moment and is thus lacking permitted pure rotation and vibration - rotation transitions . on the other hand , rotational transitions of co , such as @xmath7  = 1@xmath80 at 115 ghz , have been routinely and extensively observed in molecular clouds , which are also too cold for detection of excited levels of h@xmath1 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "radio telescopes are thus used to map co emission in the interstellar medium ( ism ) in order to delineate global distributions of molecular clouds in our galaxy and in other galaxies .",
    "it is an empirical and theoretical foundation of radio mapping that the velocity - integrated emission intensity of co ( @xmath9 , in units of k km s@xmath10 ) from a molecular cloud is proportional to the total virialized mass of the cloud , and hence to its hydrogen content @xcite .",
    "radio astronomers thus utilize @xmath9 as a proxy for h@xmath1 , by employing the `` @xmath11-factor '' @xmath12 = @xmath3(h@xmath1)/@xmath13 , where @xmath3 is the observed column density and @xmath12 will be assumed hereafter to be in units of 10@xmath14 @xmath4 ( k km s@xmath10)@xmath10 .",
    "an average value is ascribed to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the milky way , @xmath12 @xmath15 4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found significant millimeter - wave emission from co that was not associated with gmcs .",
    "this lowers the value of @xmath12 , having a mean value in the solar neighborhood of 1.8 @xmath16 0.3 @xcite .",
    "a dependence of @xmath12 on the metallicity ( primarily c / h ) of the gas has been found in , e.g. , studies of @xmath17-ray emission across the galaxy .",
    "this intensity is the product of interactions between cosmic rays and `` stationary '' gas ; thus the @xmath17-ray intensity is proportional to the amount of gas along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath12 varies between 0.4 and 10.0 from the inner galaxy to its outer regions , indicating lower gas metallicity in the outer galaxy .",
    "the gmcs , as well as the smaller dark clouds , are opaque enough that the co in their cores is not dissociated by the interstellar far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) radiation field .",
    "consequently , co is unobservable in the uv , necessitating its detection via millimeter - wave emission .",
    "on the other hand , diffuse molecular clouds ( as well as envelopes of dark clouds ) have visual extinctions lower than 5 mag , enabling a direct determination of column densities via line absorption in the uv . both co and h@xmath1 are photodissociated by far - uv radiation , resulting in a variable @xmath12 that depends on the efficiency of self shielding ( as well as mutual shielding ) of the two species @xcite , and thus on their column densities .",
    "one of our goals here is to study the behavior of @xmath12 under diffuse - ism conditions .",
    "the @xcite study of diffuse interstellar clouds showed that there is an approximate quadratic relationship between co and h@xmath1 , such that @xmath3(co ) @xmath18 [ @xmath3(h@xmath1)]@xmath19 , with @xmath20 @xmath15 2 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite remarked that for a group of lower-@xmath3 sight lines , a shallower slope with @xmath20 @xmath15 1.5 was more appropriate , thus signaling the possibility of @xmath20 varying with @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , for sight lines with log @xmath3(co ) @xmath5 16 , or values higher than those that were available to @xcite , an even steeper relationship with @xmath20 @xmath15 3 was found in the study of @xcite . both @xcite and @xcite confirmed the steepening of the slope near log @xmath3(co )",
    "@xmath15 15 , attributing it to self - shielding of co. thus a variable power law in co versus h@xmath1 shows that the abundance of co relative to h@xmath1 , and hence @xmath12 , are increasing with @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) along diffuse molecular sight lines . in this paper",
    "we explore the co versus h@xmath1 relationship in more detail , namely , the trend of co ( as well as of ch , ch@xmath2 , and cn ) versus h@xmath1 in diffuse molecular clouds and the dependence of these correlations on @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) and on physical parameters , such as the total gas ( hydrogen ) density , @xmath21 .",
    "our study differs from the recent work of @xcite and @xcite in a number of ways .",
    "first , unlike @xcite and like @xcite , our methodology is based on profile fitting of the data , with detailed decomposition into cloud component structures @xcite .",
    "we do not consider apparent optical depth nor curve of growth treatments , which are always less preferred to spectrum synthesis by profile fitting @xcite , nor do we build a grid of models to look for a solution with a single effective @xmath22-value @xcite .",
    "second , we follow up on these measurements of @xmath3 values with two methods of chemical analysis , analytical and numerical , in order to derive @xmath21 at the sites where co is detected .",
    "third , we are able to discern two regimes of co formation in terms of @xmath21 .",
    "co is associated with the similarly heavy diatomic molecules c@xmath1 and cn inside denser and colder clumps of gas @xcite , whereas in low - density clouds co is related to the formation and chemistry of ch@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this transition in the photochemistry of co will be shown ( @xmath23 3 ) to affect also the trends of other correlations among the diatomic molecules analyzed here .    in @xmath23 2 we detail our sources for data and our methods of reduction and analysis .",
    "next , in @xmath23 3 observational results are presented in terms of derived component structures and correlations between molecular column densities . in @xmath23 4 , 5 , and 6 we explore some of the physical conditions of the co - harboring gas in terms of empirical relationships , analytical chemical analysis , and detailed numerical modeling with cloudy , respectively .",
    "a discussion will be given in @xmath23 7 , followed by the conclusions in @xmath23 8 .",
    "our primary effort was to detect and measure @xmath3(co ) for new sight lines from archival _ hubble space telescope _ ( @xmath24 ) data . for most of these sight lines the value of @xmath3(h@xmath1 )",
    "was already known from previous surveys with the _ copernicus _ satellite @xcite or _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . however , for consistency , we determined @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) also for sight lines with previously published results . only two new sight lines ( hd 36841 and hd 43818 ) lack any @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) data . for these , predicted values of @xmath3(h@xmath1 )",
    "will be provided in @xmath23 4.4 after exploring the h@xmath1 relationships with co and ch .",
    "we obtained new high - resolution optical spectra of ch@xmath2 , ch , and cn by observing 42 sight lines at either mcdonald observatory or at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "results for @xmath26co , which is also present in the _ hst _ spectra , were published in @xcite .",
    "table 1 provides a list of all sight lines in terms of stars observed , their spectral types , visual magnitudes , galactic coordinates , local standard of rest ( lsr ) corrections , @xmath27 reddening values , and heliocentric distances .",
    "table 2 lists the uv data sets from @xmath24 and @xmath25 for our stellar targets , and stis optical setups in terms of gratings and apertures .",
    "initially , our sample included 66 sight lines without previous measurements of @xmath3(co ) .",
    "the uv data for 63 of these consist of archival stis observations , from which we extracted spectra of @xmath28 bands of co between 1229@xmath81544  .",
    "the remaining three sight lines have archival ghrs data .",
    "results on @xmath3(@xmath0co ) were subsequently published for 23 sight lines : 12 in @xcite , three in @xcite ( with one sight line in common with @xcite ) , and 12 in @xcite ( with two in common with @xcite and one in common with both @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this paper presents new @xmath3(@xmath0co ) results for 43 sight lines . to the entire co sample of 66 sight lines we added previously published @xmath3(co ) values for 48 directions , yielding a sample of 114 sight lines with uv data .",
    "figure 1 presents the view of co absorption along two _ hst_/stis sight lines that differ by a factor of 700 in @xmath3(co ) .",
    "our initial sample of 58 sight lines was obtained from archival _ fuse _ observations of h@xmath1 absorption at @xmath29 1100  . of these",
    ", 33 sight lines did not have published @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) results . in the meantime ,",
    "@xmath3(h@xmath1 ) results were published for five sight lines in @xcite and five more in @xcite ( with a single sight line in common with @xcite ) .",
    "this paper , therefore , presents first @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) results for 24 sight lines . as described in @xcite , our @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) values",
    "are obtained from spectrum synthesis of the ( 2@xmath80 ) , ( 3@xmath80 ) , and ( 4@xmath80 ) bands of the lyman @xmath30 transitions of h@xmath1 . the total column density @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) listed is based on the absorption from all rotational levels with @xmath31@xmath32 = 0 through 5 .",
    "roughly 95% of the total is found in the two @xmath31@xmath32 = 0 and 1 ground states of para- and ortho - h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "figure 2 presents a sample of two _ fuse _ sight lines with h@xmath1 absorption profiles that differ by a factor of 13 in @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the spectral coverage of _ fuse _ also contains absorption features from co @xcite .",
    "thus for three sight lines ( hd 208905 , hd 209481 , and hd 209975 ) with no _ hst _ spectroscopy we determined @xmath3(co ) from the @xmath30 ( 0@xmath80 ) , @xmath33 ( 0@xmath80 ) , and @xmath34 ( 0@xmath80 ) bands of co , as well as confirmed the co content along the line of sight toward hd 200775 that was previously based on @xmath35 data @xcite .",
    "the former three stars were included in the high - resolution optical study of ch , ch@xmath2 , and cn by @xcite .",
    "high - resolution optical observations of ch@xmath2 , ch , and cn were obtained with the 2dcoude cross - dispersed echelle spectrometer @xcite for the purpose of deriving cloud structure templates for co and h@xmath1 , without which one can not reliably derive the line optical depth for sight lines with very high column densities .",
    "in addition , the echelle spectra included absorption from and cn , the first provides a high signal - to - noise confirmation of the cloud structure , while @xmath3(cn ) is used to model the total gas density in the absorbing cloud , based on the ch and c@xmath1 chemical reaction network described in @xmath23 5.1 .",
    "additional absorption from ch@xmath2 provides a check on the component structure for directions with low molecular concentrations .",
    "sight lines toward 20 stars were observed at @xmath36 170,000 with the 2.7-m harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory , texas , during observing runs in 2004 january , october , and december , and 2005 may and october .",
    "each echelle exposure included nine orders , which simultaneously recorded two atomic transitions , at 4226   and the k line of at 3933  , as well as absorption lines from three molecules , ch at 4300  , ch@xmath2 at 4232  , and cn at 3784  .",
    "two - dimensional reduction tasks in iraf were used to correct these for bias , scattered light , pixel - to - pixel variations , and finally to calibrate the wavelength scale based on accompanying exposures of a th - ar lamp .",
    "the latter step yielded residuals smaller than 0.001  , or @xmath37 0.07 km s@xmath10 .",
    "for the 17 stars in our sample that are located too far south to be observable from mcdonald , data were obtained at eso in chile .",
    "five more sight lines were added to the eso observing program to complement ch results given in @xcite with new ch@xmath2 and cn acquisitions .",
    "for the 22 sight lines we obtained exposures on ch for 16 sight lines , on ch@xmath2 for 19 sight lines , and on cn for five sight lines .",
    "the observations were carried out at the 3.6-m telescope at lasilla in 2005 june and 2006 june using the coud echelle spectrograph ( ces ) @xcite .",
    "the ces is fed with an optical fiber with an aperture of 2  on the sky and provides @xmath38 of 220,000 .",
    "the data were bias subtracted , flat - fielded , and rebinned to a linear wavelength scale using the midas long package .",
    "figures 3 , 4 , and 5 , provide comparisons of sight lines with weak and strong absorption from ch@xmath2 , ch , and cn , respectively .",
    "hd 23478 and hd 210121 were observed at mcdonald , whereas the acquisition of data for hd 99872 and hd 116852 occurred at eso .",
    "we used the y.s .",
    "code , ismod.f , to model voigt absorption profiles via spectrum synthesis and automatic rms - minimizations of ( data minus fit ) residuals . besides presenting the data , figs .",
    "15 all include spectrum synthesis fits that were performed with ismod.f .",
    "the basic absorption equations were adapted in 1990 from @xcite . besides fitting radial velocity , excitation temperature ( @xmath39 ) , and total @xmath3 for any absorption feature , ismod.f provided solutions for cloud structures along each sight line , i.e. , the number of cloud components , their relative shifts and fractions , and their doppler widths ( @xmath22-values ) . this information is critical for proper evaluation of large optical depth effects and has to be derived _",
    "ab initio _ whenever not known from previous investigations .",
    "table 3 presents all cloud components that we were able to identify via molecular absorption , while figs . 3 and 5 present spectra of ch@xmath2 and cn toward hd 23478 , with each species clearly showing two cloud components .",
    "our criteria for detection were a 2-@xmath40 limit for molecular column density , as well as simultaneous detection in @xcite .",
    "all radial velocities have been transformed from the heliocentric scale to the lsr reference frame .",
    "for co transition strengths we used the @xmath41-values of @xcite , which in a global sense have been verified to a level of a few percent by @xcite , while wavelengths were obtained from @xcite .",
    "both @xmath41-values and wavelengths for h@xmath1 were obtained from @xcite via files available on the dr . mccandliss website . as for the species with optical transitions , the corresponding input values for , ,",
    "ch , ch@xmath2 , and cn were taken from table 3.4 in @xcite .",
    "a subset sample of @xmath3(@xmath0co ) and @xmath3(@xmath26co ) for 25 sight lines was published by @xcite , who showed that a minimal number of absorption bands is needed for a robust modeling of @xmath3(co ) .",
    "specifically , a few bands that are optically thin and a few that are optically thick should be simultaneously synthesized to yield a good measure of @xmath3 and of those parameters that affect line saturation in the bands , such as @xmath22 and @xmath39 .",
    "based on that sample of co results , we find that our uncertainties in @xmath3 range from a few to @xmath4220% .",
    "thus to be on the conservative side , we shall assume that the 1-@xmath40 errors are @xmath1620% , plotting this value in all of our relevant figures .",
    "all h@xmath1 lines from the @xmath31@xmath32 @xmath5 5 levels were modeled simultaneously with ismod.f .",
    "the major difference in modeling methodology between co and h@xmath1 is that for the latter we do not attempt to fit any parameters that are associated with the cloud component structure along the line of sight . this is a direct result of the relatively low spectral resolution of _ fuse _",
    "( @xmath38 @xmath42 20,000 ) as well as the restricted available range ( compared to co ) in @xmath41-values for the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath1 . since it had been discovered @xcite and will be verified in @xmath23 3.3 that @xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) have a linear relationship , our method is to apply any cloud structure already known from high - resolution ch data to the modeling of h@xmath1 , while keeping such structure parameters fixed during the fit . as in our previous work",
    "@xcite we prefer known cloud structures to effective @xmath22-values as the proper solution to h@xmath1 line saturation .",
    "this is in contrast to co , where parameters such as relative strength and width of components are allowed to vary during the fit .",
    "further details can be found in our earlier paper @xcite . in a similar fashion to co , we shall show global @xmath1620% 1-@xmath40 error bars in all our figures that present values for @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is consistent with published results .    whenever repeated multiple exposures are available , we combined them in wavelength space for an improved signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "in addition , when a feature ( band ) appears in two adjacent orders , we combined them after correcting for any small wavelength inconsistencies by subtracting the wavelength shifts as measured from the absorption line positions .",
    "all our reductions were in iraf and stsdas .",
    "a single gaussian was used to describe the instrumental profile of stis , but @xmath38 was allowed to be a free parameter in the co fits .",
    "this revealed that @xmath38 is a decreasing function of slit size for both the e140h and the e140 m gratings of stis ( see fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the range of fitted resolving powers per aperture agrees well with the range of values given by @xcite , showing that ismod.f has a good handle on @xmath38 .",
    "table 4 provides logarithmic values for total line of sight @xmath3 of all five diatomic molecules that were modeled with ismod.f spectrum synthesis in this study , as well as supplementary @xmath3 values from the literature . throughout the paper ,",
    "all log @xmath3 values are expressed in units of @xmath4 .",
    "our aim of deriving accurate column densities was the main reason for obtaining high - resolution spectra , both for co from @xmath24 uv exposures and for ch , ch@xmath2 , and cn from new optical data .",
    "these spectra reach velocity resolutions between 1.52.0 km s@xmath10 , enough to resolve many sight lines into multiple cloud components .",
    "the unveiling of such structures is important both for correctly treating the optical depth along the sight lines ( by deriving @xmath22 values for the line widths ) and for distinguishing characteristics of individual parcels of gas that would otherwise be lost in integrated line of sight values @xcite .",
    "our earlier analysis of individual cloud components toward cep ob2 in @xcite showed that fits of co cloud structures consistently resulted in structures that were similar to cn structures , even though the input for the synthesis of co was based on ch cloud structures that have more components than those found for cn .",
    "however , the sight lines sampled toward cep ob2 were molecule rich , with a median value of @xmath3(co ) = 2.5 @xmath43 10@xmath44 @xmath4 , and with cn detections along 73% of the sight lines .",
    "the new co sample presented here is molecule poor , with a median value of @xmath3(co ) = 1.0 @xmath43 10@xmath45 @xmath4 , i.e. , a factor of 25 lower in co abundance relative to the cep ob2 sample .",
    "most of the poorest sight lines here ( log @xmath3(co ) @xmath46 14 ) are without detected @xmath3(cn ) but with co cloud structures that are very similar to those of both ch and ch@xmath2 , whereas for sight lines with cn detections , cn is found in only about half of the components detected in co.    the lower molecular abundance along the new sight lines is also reflected in the generally low number of cloud components for all observed molecular species , even though these are mostly sight lines with large pathlengths that have a higher chance of intersecting molecular clouds .",
    "whereas 53% of the sample stars are farther than 1 kpc , and 23% are farther than 3 kpc , the derived cloud structures have low means of components per sight line : 1.9 @xmath16 1.0 , 1.8 @xmath16 0.9 , and 1.7 @xmath16 0.8 for ch@xmath2 , ch , and co , respectively .",
    "this shows that co is in excellent agreement with both ch and ch@xmath2 , underscoring the prevalence of low - density gas along these sight lines .",
    "the mean of cn components per sight line is smaller , 1.2 @xmath16 0.4 .",
    "cn is detected along sight lines with the higher values of @xmath3(co ) and @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) , and then , on average , inside a single component . among the 15 new co sight lines with cn detections , 13 ( 87% )",
    "have @xmath3(co ) @xmath47 14.0 , which is the median value for this sample .",
    "there are only three co components that have cn with no detected ch@xmath2 , and seven that are associated with ch@xmath2 but not with cn .",
    "we shall see in @xmath23 4.3 that this dichotomy between @xmath3(cn ) and @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) can be employed as a good qualitative indicator of @xmath21 .",
    "in the rest of this section we explore the correlations among logarithms of observed column densities by deriving power - law parameters from regression analyses of the form log @xmath3(m@xmath48 ) = log @xmath49 + @xmath20 @xmath43 log @xmath3(m@xmath50 ) @xcite , where m@xmath50 and m@xmath48 are two molecular species . unless otherwise indicated , our bces least - squares fits @xcite are done on detections only , excluding the small number of upper limits .",

    "overall , the indications are that the log @xmath3(co ) versus log @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) relationship is not strictly linear ( single - sloped ) but that the slope itself ( i.e. , the exponent @xmath20 ) is also a function of @xmath3(h@xmath1 )",
    ". indeed , when we restrict the fit to the lower end of the distribution , the returned slope is shallower , while the higher end reveals a steeper slope . in fig .",

    "these two slopes are in excellent agreement with previous estimates , confirming all indications that a steeper slope was needed for sight lines with higher values of @xmath3 .    the global behavior of @xmath3(co ) versus @xmath3(h@xmath1 )",
    "may be understood better when the uv data is complemented with @xmath3 values for 293 dark clouds detected by millimeter - wave co emission , and taken from the compilation of @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) values for dark clouds were not directly observed , but were inferred @xcite from the corresponding visual extinction ( @xmath54 ) , which is due solely to h@xmath1 in these clouds .",

    "6 , beyond the highest end of the diffuse molecular cloud distribution one encounters the dark clouds , which have higher values of molecular @xmath3 and of total gas density .",
    "the previous version of this connection between cloud classes was based on only 20 diffuse cloud data points @xcite . at the time of the @xcite study ,",
    "only five co values were known above log @xmath3 = 15 , with none available above log @xmath3 = 16 . at this time , however , we have 22 data points with log @xmath3(co ) @xmath52 15.0 , of which five are above log @xmath3(co ) = 16 , and one ( hd 200775 ) is higher than log @xmath3 = 17 . thus during the intervening 18 years the gap between diffuse sight lines and dark clouds has been filling up with observations .",
    "[ simultaneously , recent radio observations are becoming more sensitive in their ability to measure smaller co column densities that approach the diffuse cloud regime , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "given the better association between @xmath21 and the observed cn / ch@xmath2 ratio , one may imitate a 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) plot by employing proportionately - sized symbols to represent values of the latter quantity on the 2-d surface of , e.g. , the @xmath3(co ) versus @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) plot that was shown in fig .",
    "6 . from the resulting fig .",
    "17 one can discern two general trends involving variations in gas density ( as given by cn / ch@xmath2 ) .",
    "first , density is clearly the lowest toward the lower left corner of the plot ( where many of the values are upper limits ) and vice versa , showing that both @xmath3(co ) and @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) are correlated with @xmath21 .",
    "second , the density clearly varies in an orthogonal direction to its first gradient , i.e. , it is increasing from the lower envelope to the upper envelope of the distribution .",
    "@xcite were the first to find that the dispersion in the relationship of co versus h@xmath1 is significantly larger than the measurement uncertainties associated with individual data points , as confirmed in fig .",
    "these authors were also able to show that applying high - density and low - density chemical models to this relationship indicated that its width was affected by gas density , such that @xmath21 is higher at the upper envelope , in agreement with our findings using cn / ch@xmath2 as the density indicator .",
    "the two cepheus samples in @xcite appeared to occupy nonoverlapping positions on the co versus h@xmath1 plot .",
    "however , when compared with the current , much larger sample that includes the sight lines from @xcite , all cep ob2 ( having higher density gas ) and ob3 ( lower density ) data points are part of the global distribution of points , although they seem to belong to the upper and lower envelopes of the distribution , respectively , thus providing more support to the overall picture .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the co versus h@xmath1 relationship in diffuse clouds directly reflects the formation of co from a hco@xmath2 precursor .",
    "however , while the second ( cross - wise ) variation agrees qualitatively with the models of @xcite , see his fig .",
    "1 , those models do not reproduce the first variation , i.e. , the rise in density in tandem with increasing @xmath3 values .",
    "in fact , the @xcite models have _ constant _ density values between the lower left and upper right corners of the co versus h@xmath1 plot .",
    "perhaps this difference is an indication that @xcite s assumption that co production is controlled by recombination of hco@xmath2 with a constant abundance of 2 @xmath43 10@xmath77 relative to h@xmath1 is inadequate .      after fitting",
    "a correlation plot between two observed column densities ( @xmath78 ) , fit parameters may be used to predict one of the column densities ( @xmath79 ) in the absence of the other .",
    "the value of @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) = 7.410.0 @xmath43 10@xmath14 @xmath4 toward hd 208266 was given in @xcite , based on their fits of @xmath78(co ) and @xmath78(ch ) versus @xmath78(h@xmath1 ) for the small sample of sight lines toward cep ob2 .",
    "here we use the dual - slope relationship between co and h@xmath1 in fig .",
    "6(a ) , as well as the single - slope relationship between ch and h@xmath1 in fig . 8 , to predict ( the unobserved ) @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) toward the two stars without h@xmath1 data but with co and ch data , hd 36841 and hd 43818/11 gem , which are near the co versus h@xmath1 break in slope , as well as toward hd 208266 .",

    "the ch - based log @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) values for hd 36841 and hd 43818 are 20.41 @xmath16 0.08 and 20.45 @xmath16 0.08 , respectively , which are 0.05 lower and 0.13 higher than the co - based log @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) . conceivably , when the difference is larger than 20% ( or @xmath520.08 in the log ) it is reflecting the additional uncertainties introduced by the intrinsic widths of the correlations .",
    "the same exercise for hd 208266 yields log @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) = 20.95 @xmath16 0.08 , which is 0.17 lower than the co - based prediction but in excellent agreement with the predicted mid - range value given in @xcite . combining results from co and ch , both hd 36841 and hd 43818",
    "are predicted here to have log @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) = 20.4 @xmath16 0.1 , while for hd 208266 the prediction is 21.0 @xmath16 0.1 .",
    "the corresponding 3-@xmath40 uncertainties are provided by the full width ( @xmath160.3 ) of the horizontal spread of @xmath78(h@xmath1 ) in both fig . 6 and fig .",
    "we examined the results presented here from two chemical perspectives .",
    "first , two sets of analytical expressions from previous work are used in this section to extract @xmath21 associated with the material containing co , one set involves the equilibrium chemistry leading to cn and another set describes the ( equilibrium ) synthesis of ch from ch@xmath2 . in @xmath23 6",
    "we provide a more general chemical analysis based on the use of the cloudy code .",
    "analytical expressions for the chemistry connecting ch , c@xmath1 , and cn in diffuse interstellar clouds @xcite , with updated rate coefficients @xcite , are used to extract estimates for gas density , @xmath21(cn ) . to summarize , the production of cn is primarily given by the reactions c@xmath1(n ,",

    "a steady - state rate equation involving terms for chemical production and photo - destruction of cn is employed in the determination of @xmath21 @xcite .    as in our recent papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "results are presented for individual velocity components , whenever possible . like @xcite ,",
    "we determine upper limits on @xmath21(cn ) for components without detectable amounts of cn absorption .",
    "this is especially important for the results presented here because many new detections of co are found in directions that are not very rich in molecules .",
    "we do not repeat the chemical analysis for sight lines in ophiuchus and in cep ob2 and ob3 described in @xcite , nor the analyses of the photodissociation regions illuminated by hd  37903 and hd  200775 found in @xcite .",
    "similarly , many of the directions contained in a reanalysis of spectra acquired with the _ copernicus _ satellite @xcite are discussed in @xcite .",
    "updates are given for some of the sight lines examined by @xcite and @xcite in order to provide a self - consistent analysis and comparisons are presented below .",
    "a key ingredient in this analysis is the value for the amount of extinction at uv wavelengths caused by interstellar grains , @xmath81 , for each sight line .",
    "this was determined by examining various measures for grain properties : the ratio of total to selective extinction @xcite , the shape of the uv extinction curve @xcite , and a comparison of the ratio @xmath82/@xmath27 @xcite . for most sight lines ,",
    "typical grain properties apply and we adopted @xmath81 = 2 @xmath43 3.1@xmath27 , where 2 is a prefactor that depends on characteristics of the extinction curve @xcite and the amount of reddening came from the work cited above or from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . when grain properties suggested enhanced uv extinction , we used prefactors of 3 ( for the directions toward hd  12323 , hd  15137 , hd  36841 , hd  163758 , hd  185418 , hd  198781 , and hd  210121 ) or 2.5 ( for hd  14434 ) instead of 2 , depending on the severity of the difference from typical values .",
    "several directions ( hd  96675 , hd  99872 , hd  102065 , and hd  124314 ) indicated below typical uv extinction ; here the prefactor was set to 1.7 . for hd  93840 , an intermediate value seems to be appropriate , and a prefactor of 1.85 was adopted . for sight lines without information on grain properties ( hd  24190 , hd  30122 , hd  137595 , hd  190918 , hd  192035 , and hd  192369 ) ,",
    "the typical relation was employed .",

    "were obtained as part of the present study .",
    "much of the remaining data on @xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(cn ) come from the compilation of @xcite , but there are a number of updates now available . for @xmath83 per , we included the results of @xcite for ch and of @xcite for c@xmath1 .",

    "for the sight line toward hd  154368 we incorporated @xmath3(ch ) from welty ( 2005 , private communication ) and @xmath3(cn ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the gas toward hd  185418 and hd  192639 , we used the results from @xcite , supplemented by those of @xcite .",
    "since @xcite did not consider directions without detectable amounts of cn in their analyses , we do so here for hd  208440 , hd  208905 , hd  209339 , 19 cep , and hd  217035a . for stars in per ob2 ( 40 per , hd  23478 , and hd  24190 ) we used our unpublished results .",
    "we also note that for gas toward @xmath85 per , x per , and 62 tau , component structure is available for cn , but not c@xmath1 . since these species appear to coexist ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we scaled the c@xmath1 results so that cn / c@xmath1 was the same for each component .",
    "finally , as indicated in the table , line - of - sight results are given for directions where component information is missing for c@xmath1 as well as cn .",
    "the results of this analysis appear in table 7 . for each cloud in a specific direction , we list the observed values @xmath78(ch ) , @xmath78(c@xmath1 ) , and @xmath78(cn ) , and the predicted values @xmath79(c@xmath1 ) and @xmath79(cn ) that best match the observations , the kinetic temperature ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath57 , @xmath81 , and @xmath21(cn ) .",

    "the @xmath79 values are generally in very good agreement , and are always within a factor of two , of the @xmath78 values .      for many of the directions listed in table 7 , only upper limits on cn are available . for nearly all of these",
    ", co production via reactions involving ch@xmath2 appears likely ( see below ) .",
    "we therefore considered estimating the gas density from the chemical scheme linking ch and ch@xmath2 @xcite as follows : ch@xmath2(h@xmath1,h)ch@xmath88(h@xmath1,h)ch@xmath89 and the dissociative recombination ch@xmath89(e , h@xmath1)ch .",
    "in particular , we used the analytical expression in @xcite ,    @xmath90    where @xmath91(ch ) is the ch photodissociation rate [ 1.3 @xmath43 10@xmath77 exp(@xmath92 ) s@xmath10 ] , @xmath94 is the rate coefficient for the reaction ch@xmath2(h@xmath1,h)ch@xmath88 ( 1.2 @xmath43 10@xmath77 @xmath95 s@xmath10 ) , and @xmath41(h@xmath1 ) is the molecular fraction .",
    "in addition to the present study , @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) values come from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the column densities of atomic hydrogen , @xmath3 ( ) , are from @xcite for the bright stars , and from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for sight lines studied with _",
    "fuse_. data on atomic hydrogen do not exist for the sight lines toward hd  114886 and hd  137595 .",
    "for these stars , we estimated @xmath3 ( ) from @xmath27 using the relationship between reddening and total proton column density of @xcite and accounting for the amount of h@xmath1 .",
    "values of @xmath3 for the carbon - bearing molecules are taken from the sources given in the previous section for the most part or from those compiled by @xcite for the bright stars .",
    "the results appear in table 8 .",
    "many of the sight lines listed in table 7 were analyzed in our previous work .",
    "for @xmath85 per , x per , and 62 tau , we now incorporated results for individual velocity components by scaling the values for @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) to those measured for @xmath3(cn ) .",
    "the updated chemistry does not significantly affect the conclusions of @xcite for the three sight lines , nor for the gas toward @xmath84 per , @xmath83 per , @xmath96 oph , and @xmath84 oph . there is also reasonable correspondence between the present chemical results for 40 per and those of @xcite , which are based on c@xmath1 ( and c  i ) excitation .",
    "finally , our inferred density for the main component toward hd  154368 is about a factor of 2 larger than our previous estimate @xcite , which was based on an earlier , higher measure for @xmath3(ch ) .",
    "this refined value for @xmath21(cn ) is consistent with the results of @xcite from c@xmath1 excitation ( 3001000 @xmath6 ) and @xcite from cn excitation ( 7502000 @xmath6 ) .",
    "comparisons for several other sight lines with other work are also available .",
    "the most well - studied of these directions is toward hd  210121 .",
    "our chemical analysis indicates that @xmath21 = 1425 @xmath6 , one of the highest values in table 7 .",

    ", @xcite found densities of 500 to 1000 @xmath6 and 1500 to 2500 @xmath6 , respectively , while @xcite obtained densities of about 2000 @xmath6 from the distribution of c@xmath97 levels .",
    "our upper limits on density for the gas toward hd  185418 and hd  192639 ( @xmath98 30 to 40 @xmath6 ) are consistent with densities inferred from c  i excitation @xcite .    for most directions with cn upper limits ,",
    "results from cn chemistry are not very constraining ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , comparisons with c  i excitation seem to be more appropriate , as in the cases of hd  185418 and hd  192639 . for such directions ,",
    "ch@xmath2 chemistry usually dominates , and so the results from table 8 would be more meaningful .",
    "for the nearby bright stars , @xmath99 cam , @xmath100 sco , and @xmath101 nor , a comparison with the results from @xcite is possible .",
    "for the three directions , densities are derived from the quoted pressures assuming that @xmath68 is the kinetic temperature .",
    "consistency between results occurs for @xmath99 cam and @xmath101 nor , where upper limits from excitation are 10 and 370 @xmath6 , respectively , versus our values of about 1 for no enhancement in the strength of the uv radiation field .",
    "however , the @xmath102 limit toward @xmath100 sco of 70 @xmath6 contrasts with our density of 10 @xmath6 .",
    "if the cloud were near the star , such that @xmath57 was greater than 1 , the two measures could be brought into agreement .",
    "this points out a deficiency in the current analysis of ch@xmath2-like ch @xcite for many of the sight lines in table 8 : most stars in the table lie at least a kpc away .",
    "thus , a significant amount of atomic hydrogen and a corresponding amount of uv extinction are not likely associated with the gas containing ch and ch@xmath2 .",
    "the most important factor is the exponential change in extinction , thereby increasing the estimate for @xmath21 .",
    "the typical increase is about a factor of 10 , but can be significantly more . for the clouds toward hd  185418 and hd  192639 , densities approaching 10 are possible , comparable to the results from c  i @xcite .",
    "overall , the analytical results presented in tables 7 and 8 are consistent with the detailed models described next .",
    "in particular , the gas rich in cn and co tends to have larger densities .      solving for @xmath21(cn ) via the analytical chemistry scheme depends on input of @xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(cn ) , but not necessarily on the availability of @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) .",
    "when @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) is not available , it is predicted by the model via ch(c@xmath2,h)c@xmath88 , which is followed by c@xmath88(h@xmath1,h)c@xmath1h@xmath2 and c@xmath1h@xmath2(h@xmath1,h)c@xmath1h@xmath88 , both leading to the c@xmath1 molecule by dissociative recombination .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) is then determined from a steady - state rate equation involving terms for c@xmath1 chemical production and photodestruction . however ,",
    "when @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) is known , it introduces a constraint on the chemical formation of c@xmath1 , which in turn is affecting the production ( and predicted abundance ) of cn",

    "figure 18(a ) shows a logarithmic plot of cn - derived gas densities , @xmath21(cn ) , versus observed @xmath3(cn ) for sight lines with detected cn components , fitted with @xmath20 = 0.31 @xmath16 0.10 ( solid line ) .",
    "( data were gathered from the chemical analyses of this paper , of @xcite and of @xcite . ) whereas sight lines without observed values of @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) ( empty circles ) show a loose correlation with @xmath51 = 0.32 between @xmath21(cn ) and @xmath3(cn ) , a much tighter correlation with @xmath51 = 0.61 is seen in the distribution of the filled circles , which denote sight lines with c@xmath1 measurements .",
    "thus it is apparent that more robust derivations of @xmath21(cn ) require not only observed @xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(cn ) values , but also observed @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) data .",

    "the most important aspect to our calculations is the modeling of nonequilibrium chemistry in order to simulate the formation of ch@xmath2 and its trickle - down effects on co. to this end , we use the method given in @xcite that incorporates a coupling between the ions and neutrals .",

    "it is generally agreed that nonequilibrium chemistry is the key to solving the ch@xmath2 abundance problem in diffuse clouds .",
    "however , the exact physical mechanism producing ch@xmath2 is still unclear .",
    "hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic shock models @xcite generate large amounts of ch@xmath2 by heating the gas to where ch@xmath2 efficiently forms by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , the lack of velocity differences between ch and ch@xmath2 @xcite argues against shocks , while excitation analysis of interstellar c@xmath1 @xcite suggests ch@xmath2 production occurs in regions where the gas temperature is 50100 k. recently , @xcite modeled the effects of turbulent diffusion on diffuse cloud chemistry , determining that this mechanism can increase the ch@xmath2 abundance by up to an order of magnitude , which is still @xmath422 orders of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "it has been suggested that ch@xmath2-formation is driven by non - maxwellian velocity distributions of h@xmath1 and/or c@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "one possible solution to the problem of forming large quantities of ch@xmath2 in cold ( @xmath124 100 k ) regions is discussed in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the authors propose alfvn waves entering a diffuse cloud from the intercloud medium are coupled to the cold gas through the lorentz force ( for ions ) and collisions with the ions ( for neutral atoms / molecules ) .",
    "the coupling results in significant nonthermal motion of the gas along the physical extent over which the mhd waves do not dissipate , consisting of a boundary layer on the cloud - intercloud surface . as a result",
    ", an effective temperature can be defined that characterizes the reaction between two species undergoing nonthermal motions @xcite @xmath125 in this equation , @xmath94 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath101 is the reduced mass of the system , and @xmath114 is assumed to equal the alfvn speed . for turbulent velocities consistent with the observed linewidths of ch@xmath2 , @xmath113 is large enough to significantly increase the reaction rate of equation ( 1 ) , increasing @xmath3(ch@xmath120 to values consistent with observation .",
    "while this physical process is not the only possible explanation for the observed ch@xmath2 abundance , this method does have several important characteristics .",
    "one is that it allows for the formation of ch@xmath2 without heating the gas to temperatures inconsistent with the observed level of molecular excitation .",
    "this mechanism also explains the lack of oh toward @xmath83 per as a result of ion - neutral decoupling , where the magnetic field was coupled to the ions but not the neutrals .",
    "thus @xmath113 increased the reaction rate of ion - neutral reactions such as equation ( 1 ) , but not neutral - neutral reactions such as o(h@xmath1,h)oh , an important pathway to oh production at high temperatures . finally , alfvn wave propagation and dissipation in a cold diffuse cloud is a relatively simple way to model nonequilibrium effects in a calculation designed to model equilibrium chemistry .",
    "all one needs to do is compute @xmath113 for each reaction using equation ( 2 ) and replace @xmath86 with @xmath113 when calculating the rate coefficient .",
    "the regions where ch@xmath2 forms also contain significant quantities of other molecules .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the actual physical processes controlling ch@xmath2 formation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated the contribution to the formation of ch and co due to equilibrium processes alone ( i.e. due to regions that do not form ch@xmath2 ) using a simple chemical model of a diffuse cloud .",
    "these studies found that most ch and co ( over 90% in many cases ) could not be explained through equilibrium processes .",
    "the conclusion is that ch and co in low - density ( @xmath126 100 @xmath6 ) sight lines form in regions where nonequilibrium processes dominate the chemistry .",
    "so the same physical process that controls ch@xmath2 formation is also likely to contribute to the formation of these molecules .",
    "almost all explanations to account for ch@xmath2 involve increasing the temperature in order to activate the formation channel given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , increasing the temperature also increases the rates of other reactions , leading to increased formation of certain molecules .",
    "one example , oh , has already been mentioned .",
    "forming ch@xmath2 via equation ( 1 ) also leads to increased formation of ch through the chain involving ch@xmath88 and ch@xmath89 , as was given in @xmath23 5.2 .",
    "forming ch@xmath2 also leads to the formation of co@xmath2 via the reaction ch@xmath2(o , h)co@xmath2 , which is then followed by these two co - forming channels : co@xmath2(h , h@xmath2)co and co@xmath2(h@xmath1,h)hco@xmath2 together with hco@xmath2(e , h)co . finally , co and ch are coupled through the neutral - neutral reaction ch(o , h)co .",
    "this last reaction is an efficient formation route of co and destruction route for ch at the high effective temperatures required for ch@xmath2 formation . at higher density ( @xmath127 100 @xmath6 ) , c@xmath2(oh , h)co@xmath2 , followed by either co@xmath2-to - co channel above ,",

    ". however , since neither model considered ch@xmath2 formation nor nonequilibrium chemistry ( although the meudon pdr group did in the past take ch@xmath2 into account through a shock model , see @xcite ) , the co relationship with h@xmath1 is likely to be much different in a model that also reproduces trends in ch@xmath2 versus h@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 versus co. such modeling and comparisons with observed trends in h@xmath1 , co , and ch@xmath2 abundances are the goals of our analysis .",

    "the best correspondence is seen when @xmath3(co)/@xmath3(h@xmath1 ) is plotted against @xmath3(cn)/@xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) in the right panel of fig . 16 .",
    "this arises because cn only probes denser diffuse gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which ch@xmath2 is more likely to be destroyed by h@xmath1 .",
    "the limitations involve a number of factors . for a given velocity component",
    ", the amount of ch@xmath2-like ch @xcite is not easily obtained ; the dispersion in the relationship between @xmath3(ch ) and @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) for directions without detectable amounts of cn is too large @xcite .",
    "most sight lines , however , reveal absorption from all three molecules at a given velocity ( e.g. , table 3 ) . as for the ch@xmath2 chemistry , the amount of material along a line of sight and the strength of the local interstellar radiation field are not well known , especially for stars greater than a kpc away .",
    "more comprehensive models , combining the synthesis of ch@xmath2 and cn , are needed for the next level of understanding .",
    "our goal is to apply models based on cloudy to this problem .    in this work",
    ", we presented a series of cloudy - based calculations of diffuse cloud conditions that simultaneously reproduce the observed h@xmath1 , ch@xmath2 , and co abundances in these environments .",
    "diffuse sight lines with @xmath3(co ) @xmath37 10@xmath4510@xmath44 @xmath4 are well characterized by regions with @xmath21/@xmath139 100 @xmath6 , _ but only if the effects of ch@xmath2 are taken into account_. without the effects of nonequilibrium ch@xmath2 chemistry , equilibrium calculations predict too little co per h@xmath1 .",
    "this result appears robust to uncertainties in the c / h abundance or the co photodissociation rate .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) increases with increasing @xmath3(co ) , until @xmath3(co ) reaches 10@xmath4510@xmath44 @xmath4 . for @xmath3(co ) @xmath52 10@xmath44 @xmath4 , @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) appears to decrease for increasing @xmath3(co ) .",
    "our models show this is likely a density effect , with @xmath3(co ) increasing , and @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) decreasing , with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "last , the observed trend of @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) flattening out at a few times 10@xmath26 @xmath4 can be explained if the nonequilibrium chemistry acts only over a certain physical size , such as the alfvn wave propagation formalism in @xcite . the observed scatter in @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) with @xmath3(ch@xmath2 )",
    "is best explained through a combination of density effects and the importance of nonequilibrium processes , parametrized in this work by @xmath116 .",
    "the sight lines from our study have properties comparable to those inferred from both ( a ) self - absorption ( hisa ) clouds with weak or no co emission and ( b ) co - poor h@xmath1 gas revealed via @xmath17-rays and far - infrared ( fir ) emission .",
    "the former category has been investigated in recent 21-cm radio @xmath140 surveys of the galactic plane @xcite , showing that cold atomic hydrogen gas is not necessarily associated with detections of co emission . since",
    "these clouds can be small ( @xmath37 0.6 pc ) with @xmath75 @xmath47 100 @xmath6 and @xmath141 @xmath37 50 k , the physical conditions in them are very similar to the clouds studied here , or in other words , they correspond to the intermediate category of diffuse molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "one may , therefore , assume that despite co nondetections via radio emission , co is likely present in these clouds , albeit with low co / h@xmath1 values determined by small values of @xmath142 .",
    "such clouds with low @xmath3(co ) should , in principle , be detected via uv absorption .",
    "for example , @xcite provide @xmath3(co ) @xmath37 6 @xmath43 10@xmath44 @xmath4 for a small hisa feature , an upper limit that excludes only the top 6% of our diffuse sight lines .",
    "in fact , an analysis of a galactic plane survey by @xcite has determined that 60% of hisa features are associated with co emission , with @xmath75 @xmath42 few @xmath43 100 @xmath6 and 6 k @xmath37 @xmath141 @xmath37 41 k. although @xcite suggest that these are `` missing link '' clouds between the atomic and dense molecular varieties , we point out that this region in parameter space is occupied by diffuse molecular clouds . with h / h@xmath1 @xmath5 0.01 and co / h@xmath1",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath108 @xcite these are probably clouds that include the types of carbon - bearing molecular photochemistries that were explored here .",
    "the inferred @xmath141 values are lower than the @xmath68(h@xmath1 ) kinetic temperatures along diffuse sight lines , resembling more @xmath69(c@xmath1 ) values that are associated with denser diffuse gas and the presence of @xmath26co @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see if these colder clouds are related to sight lines with very low @xmath0co/@xmath26co as observed by @xcite using millimeter - wave @xmath140 observations .    a second category of co - poor h@xmath1 gas has been revealed in fir studies @xcite .",
    "the survey of @xcite found infrared excess emission from cirrus clouds attributed to cold h@xmath1 gas and dust , whereas only half of the clouds showed detectable levels of co emission .",
    "when detected , co was found to be subthermally excited with inferred @xmath21 @xmath42 200 @xmath6 and @xmath0co/@xmath26co ratios between @xmath4210 and @xmath5290 , all indicating overlap with the parameter space of diffuse molecular clouds .",
    "co - poor h@xmath1 gas has been inferred also from galactic surveys of @xmath17 rays @xcite , which trace the gas content in the ism and show an `` excess '' of @xmath17 emission not associated with co emission . indeed ,",
    "@xcite indicate that the co - less gas is found around dense molecular clouds ( that are detected via co emission ) and along bridges between cloud cores and atomic gas , precisely the sites where one would find gas known as diffuse molecular clouds . as is the case with the hisa clouds",
    ", we believe that co is still there , albeit at low levels of abundance relative to h@xmath1 that are potentially observable via uv absorption but are not seen via current methods that detect co in emission .",
    "@xcite showed that a connection exists between diffuse molecular gas and dark clouds , namely , that there is good agreement in ch abundance and radial velocity between radio emission for dark clouds and optical absorption along nearby sight lines , the latter probing the outer envelopes of dark clouds .",
    "this ch connection has been exploited by magnani and colleagues @xcite in deriving co / h@xmath1 ratios for translucent sight lines , based on the tight correlation between ch and h@xmath1 ( @xcite ; our @xmath23 3.3 ) .",
    "@xcite observed radio emission from ch along the galactic plane , finding similarities to co emission line profiles and inferring that the molecular gas has @xmath21 @xmath37 1000 @xmath6 .",
    "the material resembles the denser gas in our sample of diffuse molecular clouds , consistent with the presence of co emission ( see @xmath23 7.2 ) .",
    "this connection is also related to oh emission that has been detected from intermediate regions around denser molecular co - emitting clouds @xcite and the lack of a correlation between @xmath3(@xmath26co ) and @xmath3(oh ) in another sample of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "our study of diffuse molecular clouds employed a new and extensive sample of sight lines with uv observations of co and h@xmath1 to explore in detail the power - law relationship between the two species .",
    "the slope of log @xmath3(co ) @xmath18 @xmath20 @xmath43 log @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) was shown to require two components , one with @xmath20 = 1.5 @xmath16 0.2 for log @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) @xmath98 20.4 , and another @xmath20 = 3.1 @xmath16 0.7 for vuv sight lines with higher @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the break in slope arises from a change in co production , with ch@xmath2 + o important at low @xmath3(co ) and c@xmath2 + oh at @xmath3(co ) @xmath52 10@xmath45 @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio co / h@xmath1 has a dependence on @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) that results in an increase by @xmath423.5 orders of magnitude over the range of log @xmath3(h@xmath1 ) @xmath15 19.522.0 . causes for variation in @xmath12 include ( a ) the @xmath142 ratio , which affects production and destruction , including self shielding , and ( b ) the metallicity of gas .",
    "together with the co and h@xmath1 we also analyzed new data for the carbon - bearing diatomic molecules ch , ch@xmath2 , and cn ( as well as c@xmath1 ) that are accessible through ground - based spectroscopy . the linear relationship between @xmath3(ch ) and",
    "@xmath3(h@xmath1 ) was confirmed again , both directly using these two molecules , as well as indirectly by showing that the co versus ch relationship follows that for co versus h@xmath1 . after determining fitted relationships of both co and ch versus",
    "h@xmath1 we were able to employ fit parameters in the prediction of @xmath79(h@xmath1 ) for three sight lines without h@xmath1 data . analyzing @xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) versus h@xmath1 and",
    "co resulted in two more confirmations of the power - law break displayed by co versus either h@xmath1 or ch , showing that this break separates the regime of low - density photochemistry from that involving high density .",
    "as for @xmath3(cn ) , all our regression fits returned slopes with @xmath20 @xmath5 1.8 , somewhat shallower than earlier reports . since essentially all cn detections are along high - density sight lines , the absence of a detected break in slope for the ( smaller ) cn sample is not surprising .    many of the sight lines here are helping us to explore molecular environments that are associated with low @xmath21 .",
    "as such , these lines of sight probe regions where nonequilibrium ch@xmath2 chemistry is dominating the production of co , as confirmed by modeling with cloudy .",
    "for those sight lines with higher @xmath21 it was possible to include ( equilibrium ) chemistry of ch , c@xmath1 , and cn to predict molecular abundances and gas density .",
    "such predictions were found to have tighter correlations when @xmath3(c@xmath1 ) is part of the input into the chemical model .",
    "for the entire range of densities we showed that the empirical ratio @xmath3(cn)/@xmath3(ch@xmath2 ) is better suited than @xmath3(cn)/@xmath3(ch ) as an indicator of the average @xmath21 along diffuse sight lines .",
    "we also considered rotational ( excitation ) temperatures in our modeling of co and h@xmath1 , showing that @xmath72(co ) does not vary for @xmath7 = 13 . on",
    "the other hand , @xmath72(h@xmath1 ) increases with @xmath7 , with indistinguishable slopes between log @xmath72 and log @xmath68 for @xmath7 = 24 .",
    "further analysis of the excitation of both molecules should help constrain the conditions in diffuse molecular clouds .    as related in @xmath23 7.4",
    ", it is our understanding that the regime of low-@xmath3(co ) , low-@xmath21 diffuse molecular clouds is also sampled by a variety of non - uv observational methods , which nonetheless result in a significant number of co nondetections .",
    "thus the true nature of diffuse molecular clouds is best revealed by synoptic knowledge extracted from studies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from radio and fir , through visible and uv , to gamma ray observations .",
