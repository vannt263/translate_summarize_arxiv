    "some works specifically addressed the spatial shape of the atom laser beam @xcite , but rely essentially on numerical simulations or neglect the influence of dimensionality and potential inhomogeneity .",
    "for realistic experimental conditions , the 3d external potential is inhomogeneous , and full numerical simulation become particularly cumbersome .",
    "one thus needs a simplified analytical theoretical framework to handle the beam propagation .",
    "following our previous work @xcite , we present here in detail a simple but general framework for the propagation of atom laser beams in inhomogeneous media .",
    "we show how several theoretical tools from classical optics can be adapted for coherent atom - optics .",
    "we address three major formalisms used in optics : the eikonal approximation , the fresnel - kirchhoff integral , and the @xmath0 matrices formalism in the paraxial approximation .",
    "the first part of the paper gives an overview of these theoretical tools for atom laser beam propagation .",
    "in the first section , we introduce the integral equation of the propagation and its time - independent version .",
    "we present in the second section different ways of dealing with the time - independent propagation of the matter wave .",
    "first , the time - independent propagator is computed using the stationary phase approximation .",
    "then , we show that two approximations -the eikonal and the paraxial approximation- , which apply in different physical contexts , can provide a more tractable treatment than the general integral equation . in the second part",
    ", we show in practice how to use these methods in the experimental case of @xcite with a rubidium radiofrequency - coupled atom laser . some of these methods have recently been used also for a metastable helium atom laser @xcite as well as for a raman - coupled atom laser @xcite",
