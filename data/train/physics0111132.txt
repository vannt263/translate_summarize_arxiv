    "the outcome of the kawata - sugiura levitation experiment from 1992 @xcite is in some ways still surprising .",
    "the authors examined the radiation force on a micrometer - sized spherical dielectric particle in the evanescent field produced by a laser beam of moderate power , @xmath0 mw . as one would expect , the particle moved along the horizontal plate at a speed of a few micrometers per second , as a result of the tunneled photons in the evanescent field .",
    "the surprising point is , however : why does the particle _ lift _ from the surface ? as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` the particle is forced to float from the substrate surface and to slide along the surface . '' for a non - magnetic and non - absorbing dielectric particle , it is well known that the electromagnetic volume force density @xmath1 is @xmath2 @xmath3 being the permittivity such that @xmath4 in the homogeneous and isotropic interior , and different from zero only in the particle s boundary layer .",
    "the evanescent field is known to vary as @xmath5 $ ] in the vertical direction ( see eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) below ) , and is significant only very close to the substrate . in practice , this field interacts with those parts of the particle that are situated closest to the substrate , and it gives rise to a surface force that , according to eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , has to act in the _ downward _ direction ( assuming that @xmath6 ) .",
    "it is simply impossible to account for a lift force on the particle , using eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy between electromagnetic theory for dielectrics and the kawata - sugiura experiment @xcite is therefore , as mentioned above , somewhat surprising at first sight , since eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) has generally been proven to be invaluable in a multitude of cases in electromagnetism and optics .",
    "consequently , we have to conclude that the explanation for the observed lift of the particle has to lie in the presence of an additional force , different from the one given by eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the following two possibilities come to mind :    \\(1 ) the particle has a complex permittivity @xmath3 , and is therefore exposed to a repulsive ( or positive lift ) force caused by the absorption of radiation in the interior .",
    "\\(2 ) another natural possibility is that _ surface effects _ may have played a significant role in the experiments .",
    "the presence of impurities on the surface , or the presence of a liquid of a film of adsorbed material , may have a considerable influence on the electrical conductivity of the surface region , and can thus enhance multiple scattering effects .",
    "this allows for an analysis of the problem in terms of a multiple scattering formalism . adopting such a picture",
    ", the vertical force on the particle necessarily has to be repulsive ; the photons are bouncing off the spherical surface and are , accordingly , transferring an impulse in the upward direction .    in the present paper",
    ", we will be studying option ( 1 ) above , thus allowing for a complex @xmath3 , which in turn implies a non - vanishing effective conductivity @xmath7 in the interior of the particle .",
    "as far as we know , such a study has not previously been undertaken .",
    "this study is a continuation of the work of almaas and brevik @xcite , dealing with the case of a pure dielectric ( real @xmath3 ) . whereas the analysis in @xcite gave satisfactory results for the _ horizontal _ radiation force observed in the kawata - sugiura experiment , it was impossible , as mentioned above , on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) to account for an upward directed vertical force . from now on , we will assume that the particle is a sphere of radius @xmath8 , and regard the effective conductivity @xmath7 as an input parameter .    before embarking on the mathematical formalism ,",
    "let us however make some further remarks related to option ( 2 ) above .",
    "there is a variety of surface effects that one can envisage : multiple reflections , as mentioned ; moreover capillary forces ( the order of magnitude of the capillary forces may be up to @xmath9 n ) , surface tension ( because of the capillary forces ) , viscous retarding forces if the sphere and the surface are immersed in a liquid , electrostatic forces , and finally the role of evaporation .",
    "cf . in this context",
    "the survey given by vilfan _",
    "_ @xcite . especially the role of the _ size _ of the spherical particle seems to be important .",
    "if the particle is large , multiple scattering between the sphere and the substrate distorts the evanescent wave structure that one would have in the absence of the particle .",
    "lester and nieto - vesperinas @xcite recently analyzed the problem using multiple scattering methods , and were able to account for a positive lift force .",
    "an advantage of this kind of method is that the proximity of the sphere - substrate two - body system is addressed explicitly .",
    "in contrast , our formalism is built on the model of scattering of an evanescent wave by an isolated sphere , and is therefore not expected to be very accurate for small separations between the sphere and the substrate .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the adoption of a multiple scattering method does not _ in itself _ imply that the lift force is positive , as long as the material in the sphere is a pure dielectric .",
    "regardless of whether the electromagnetic boundary conditions at the surface of the substrate are taken into account or not , for a pure dielectric , the force on the sphere is given by eq.([1 ] ) , and , as we have argued above , is necessarily downward directed . to account for a positive lift force",
    ", we must allow for deviations from the simple theory of pure dielectrics , meaning that absorption , and consequently conductivity , are important effects in the theory , explicitly or implicitly .    as already mentioned , we will not attempt to give a quantitative description of a possible adsorbed film on the surface ; the physical reason for such a film may be quite complex",
    ". problems of this sort belong to the vast field of physicochemical hydrodynamics .",
    "[ a good source of information in this area is the book of levich @xcite ; a briefer treatment is found in landau and lifshitz @xcite ] .",
    "it is noticeable that the experiment of vilfan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite similarly measured a repulsive force .",
    "they obtained a force 300 pn on a dielectric sphere of radius 5 @xmath10 m in the evanescent field of a 500 mw laser focused to a diameter of 5 @xmath10 m .",
    "these spheres are relatively large , and are therefore likely to distort the evanescent field structure considerably .    in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the wave theoretical formalism describing the interaction between the evanescent field and the sphere . in section 3 ,",
    "we show how the surface force @xmath11  _",
    "i.e. _ the part of the total radiation force @xmath12 which is associated with the boundary and independent of the absorptive properties in the interior  can be written as a double sum over complex expansion coefficients .",
    "section 4 , the main section of our paper , contains the calculation of the absorptive part @xmath13 of the radiation force .",
    "the results are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] - [ fig:5 ] .",
    "our calculations incorporate both the two polarization states of the incident beam ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 polarization ) .",
    "our main analytical result is given in eq .",
    "( [ 56 ] ) , for the non - dimensional vertical absorptive force component @xmath16 .",
    "as one would expect physically , the result becomes proportional to the effective conductivity @xmath7 .",
    "for the polystyrene latex spheres , or glass spheres , used in the kawata - sugiura experiment , the values of @xmath7 are low .",
    "hence , it turns out that @xmath16 becomes too weak to account for the floating of the sphere in the gravitational field . now , our formalism has , of course , a much wider scope than the kawata - sugiura experiment . in optics ,",
    "there are numerous cases where radiation forces interact with absorbing media .",
    "for instance , the current development of microelectromagnetical systems , which are used in a variety of applications including even measurements of the casimir force , accentuates the usefulness of the present theory .",
    "a sketch of the geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : a laser beam is incident from below through a transparent medium , called medium 1 , and hits the plane , horizontal surface towards the transparent medium 2 at an angle of incidence , @xmath17 , which is greater than the critical angle , @xmath18 , for total reflection .",
    "this establishes an evanescent field above the plane surface , which , in turn , is regarded as the incident field falling upon a compact sphere of radius @xmath8 and complex refractive index @xmath19 .",
    "the sphere is centered at the origin with the @xmath20 axis pointing vertically upwards .",
    "if @xmath21 is the complex permittivity of the ( non - magnetic ) sphere , we will require it to be related to the effective conductivity , @xmath7 , through the equation @xmath22 hence @xmath23 .    , with complex refractive index @xmath19 , situated in an evanescent field with its center at a height @xmath24 above the plane substrate .",
    "a laser beam is incident from below at an angle of incidence @xmath25 .",
    "refractive indices in the transparent media 1 and 2 are respectively @xmath26 and @xmath27.,width=188 ]    here , a remark is called for as regards our formal use of the dispersion relation . for simplicity , taking the medium to have only one resonance frequency , we can write the complex permittivity as @xmath28 cf . , for instance , eq .  ( 7.56 ) in jackson @xcite . here the first term @xmath29 describes the contribution from the dipoles and can be taken to be constant , whereas the second term describes the dispersive properties of the free electrons .",
    "@xmath30 is the damping constant .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) gives for the frequency dependent term @xmath31 @xmath32 typically @xmath33 , so that we can identify the frequency dependent quantity @xmath34 with a constant , equal to the static conductivity @xmath35 , only for frequencies @xmath36 less than about 10 ghz .",
    "our frequencies are obviously higher : a vacuum wavelength of @xmath37 m corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "thus our @xmath31 is an _ effective _ conductivity , defined in accordance with the low - frequency relation ( 2 ) , but no longer identifiable with the static conductivity @xmath35 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath31 has to be evaluated in each case .",
    "take water as an example , for which @xmath39 for the actual wavelength @xcite .",
    "writing in general the complex refractive index as @xmath40 we get , when @xmath41 , @xmath42 , which in our case amounts to only @xmath43 , corresponding to @xmath44 this can be compared with the static conductivity for pure water , which is much smaller , @xmath45 s / m @xcite .",
    "it is notable that the value of @xmath7 is real .    increasing the incident wavelength somewhat",
    ", the absorptive effect can be enhanced .",
    "thus , if we consider glass , and choose @xmath46 m , we have @xmath47 @xcite . with @xmath48 in this case we get for the effective conductivity quite an appreciable value : @xmath49 ( actually the parameter @xmath50 is as high as 0.265 in this case , and can hardly be assumed to be a `` small '' parameter any longer if @xmath51 is increased further . )",
    "we assume now that the incoming beam in medium 1 is a plane wave , such that its electric and magnetic field amplitudes are related through @xmath52 .",
    "we introduce the non - dimensional wave number , @xmath53 , in medium 2 , and the relative radial coordinate @xmath54 : @xmath55 and make use of the standard spherical coordinates @xmath56 centered at the origin of the sphere .",
