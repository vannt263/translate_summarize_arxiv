    "importantly , split scenarios are not arbitrarily heavy when reasonable assumptions are applied .",
    "too heavy scalars would induce too much quantum corrections to the higgs boson mass .",
    "100 ( @xmath1 ) tev stops can induce 125 gev higgs mass for @xmath2 @xcite , for example . also , too heavy lsps would have too much relic abundance by now .",
    "including sommerfeld enhancement , 3.1 ( 1.0 ) tev wino ( higgsino ) lsp can have the right amount of relic density  @xcite .",
    "a heavier lsp would be generally constrained  we are ignoring possibilities of conspired mechanisms to dilute relic density .",
    "gauge coupling unification prefers gauginos and higgsinos to be below 5 - 50 tev  @xcite .",
    "the general existence of upper bounds on the split spectrum , especially the lsp in the tev region , may imply that we can test the split scenario as a whole in near - future collider experiments .",
    "scalars of @xmath3 are too heavy for collider discovery , although they may show evidence in future flavor and cp violation measurements for some cases .",
    "indirect detections of heavy wino dark matter are other useful probes  @xcite , but are subject to various uncertainties , some maybe even unknown , intrinsic to astrophysical observations .",
    "direct probes are still wanted , and lighter gauginos can play an important role in this endeavor .    given these , what do we really need to eventually probe split scenarios up to the relic density upper bounds on lsp masses at a future collider ?",
    "scenarios leading to split spectrum typically generate gaugino masses from anomaly mediation ( amsb )  @xcite .",
    "it is because if susy is spontaneously broken by charged superfields , for example , gaugino masses are prohibited while scalar masses are not .",
    "a loop - factor hierarchy between fermions and scalars is generated .",
    "some variants are discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "we start by discussing the amsb gaugino model without light higgsinos .",
    "this model is not only generic , but provides a simple and clear framework for our analysis whose results become the basis for more general studies .",
    "most simplifying assumptions that we will discuss for collider and cosmological bounds are automatically satisfied in this model .",
    "this model may also be the most difficult scenario for the discovery as the gluino takes on its heaviest value with respect to the wino mass , and the winos are degenerate and difficult to find at colliders directly .",
    "thus , studying this scenario can reasonably provide farthest discovery reach estimation .",
    "after this discussion , we generalize the spectrum and investigate how light higgsino nlsps added to the amsb gaugino spectrum modify the analysis , and how we can apply the results to a general spectrum with variable mass ratios and ordering so that other susy breaking mediation models can be studied .",
    "model - dependent cosmological bounds are not considered together .",
    "we demonstrate that a useful parameter is gluino - to - lsp mass ratio both for the discovery and the discrimination of models .",
    "in a simple model we consider in this section , scalars and higgsinos are all heavy , and lighter amsb gaugino masses at leading order ( lo ) are m_i^a = m_3/2 .",

    "[ fig : gaugino_masses ] ; see appendix for how we obtain them .",
    "notably , nlo mass ratios depend somewhat on scalar masses , higgsino masses , and the overall wino mass scale which can be important for split spectrum . with heavy scalars , higgsino mass dependence is largest for small @xmath5  higgsino threshold correction , @xmath6 , proportional to @xmath7",
    "rather than @xmath8 can be thought of as renormalization group - induced mixing effect  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath5 is large , heavy squark threshold corrections raise mainly only the gluino mass , thus raising the mass ratio .",
    "if scalars are light , effects from higgsinos and scalars are small  the simplest amsb models predict scalars as heavy as the gravitino  @xcite , @xmath9 , but making them lighter is also discussed in light of fine tuning issue  @xcite .",
    "higgsinos heavier than about 50 tev may be disfavored by gauge coupling unification and are not considered ; heavier higgsinos could have distorted the spectrum more  @xcite . when @xmath7 is negative , shown as the blue region in the figures , the wino gets negative corrections , raising the gluino to wino mass ratio further .    the uncertainty colored bands are spanned by mentioned variations of scalar masses ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath11 ) as well as renormalization scale ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the central scale is chosen @xmath13 to minimize a log .",
    "the uncertainty from the renormalization scale is smallest among these .",
    "the rapid change in the light wino region is due to gauge coupling running ( with @xmath14 ) mixed with the aforementioned effects .    in this section ,",
    "we assume heavy @xmath15 and large @xmath16 .",
    "later , we discuss how uncertainties from model parameters can be reflected in the disovery prospect .",
    "heavy higgsinos can still help to achieve radiative ewsb .",
    "if @xmath17 runs quickly down to an approximate infrared fixed point with value @xmath18 , a similar size of @xmath19 can trigger ewsb ( at least for large @xmath5 ) m_z^2 ~ -2 ( m_h_u^2 +     -b _ & ||^2 + m_h_d^2 ) 0 .",

    "they are not suitable production modes for discovery at a hadron collider .",
    "gluino pair production may be the only viable discovery channel at a hadron collider . to begin with , the gluino is assumed to decay as q |q , q = u , d , s , c , b , t [ eq : gluinodecay]via off - shell squarks .",
    "it leads to traditional susy signatures of jets plus missing energy .",
    "we do not distinguish chargino and neutralino of the same kind because nearly degenerate chargino decays produce only invisibly soft particles .",
    "decays into top quarks ( either into @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) are not only possible but can be enhanced if stops are lighter than squarks .",
    "however , top quarks are highly boosted in heavy gluino decays and top decay products are collimated within an opening angle @xmath23  where 0.4 is our jet radius in jet algorithm .",
    "thus , without a dedicated top tagging technique applied , top would look essentially like a single jet .",

    ", we may need at least 200 @xmath0 collider with @xmath60 of data .",
    "if sfermions are lighter and just as heavy as gluinos , about 2 - 4 times smaller luminosity is needed as the gluino becomes comparatively lighter .",
    "our @xmath26 analysis is applicable much more widely , not just to the amsb model without light higgsinos .",
    "if we allow light higgsino nlsp in the amsb gaugino model , one possible modification is mixing between gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "if @xmath61 with tev - scale gauginos , the mass splitting between charged and neutral components of wino / higgsino are still kept smaller than 10 gev making chargino decays inaccessible . in this limit , multi - jet",

    "however , pure higgsino nlsp can also enable a two - step decay of the gluinos jj jjjj h , w , z. if higgsinos are kept far away from winos , more than 85% of gluino _ pairs _ still decay into pure hadronic final states either via one - step ( 60 - 70% ) or two - step decays ( 20 - 25% ) .",
    "in the pure hadronic final states , previous @xmath26 analysis can be used with the same set of backgrounds analysis ( as discussed here ) , boosted leptons from two - step decays can also be utilized  @xcite . ] .",
    "fortunately , two - step decays of the gluino do not modify @xmath26 spectrum significantly compared to that of one - step decays as long as the gluino - to - higgsino mass ratio is greater than about 3 .",
    "if higgsinos are closer to gluinos , visible particles are softer while missing transverse energy is smaller , and @xmath26 becomes significantly smaller . the difference , however , resides in how much @xmath26 is contributed from visible particles or missing transverse energy ( met ) .",
    "two - step decay has more visible particles and smaller met .",
    "this can help to distinguish one - step vs.  two - step decay using the @xmath62 variable discussed earlier , which is larger for messier two - step decay ; but this separate measurement will need much more luminosity .    in all , effects of adding nlsp higgsinos to the amsb gaugino model are minimal as long as higgsinos are far away from gauginos .",
    "the small changes in the branching ratios and the @xmath26 spectrum result in about 1.5 times more luminosity needed for the discovery compared to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach - glupair ] .",
    "the @xmath26 spectrum of one - step decaying gluinos is not that sensitive to the lsp mass if gluino - to - lsp mass ratio is greater than 3 .",
    "again , if a lsp is closer to the gluino , @xmath26 becomes smaller and the signal is buried under backgrounds .",
    "thus , the previous results of @xmath26 are valid for any models of gaugino mass ( not just to amsb ) as long as these validity conditions and simplifying assumptions are satisfied ; otherwise , @xmath26 would not be the right approach for discovery .",
    "this is very useful because we can interpret our results as the discovery reach of gluino - to - lsp mass ratio in a model independent way , and the gaugino mass ratio is what is sensitive to the underlying susy breaking mediation model .",
    "although different susy breaking mediation models may have different golden channels for discovery , we also study others models to illustrate the usefulness of interpreting results in terms of gluino - to - lsp mass ratio .    three characteristic patterns of gaugino mass ratios are categorized in ref.@xcite as minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , amsb and mirage mediation patterns . in this classification , the minimal gauge mediation model ( mgmsb ) is subsumed under msugra .",
    "we consider mgmsb where scalars are relatively light @xmath63 , and calculate gaugino masses .",
    "lo gaugino masses are  @xcite m_i^g = _ susy , [ eq : gmsb]where @xmath64 in terms of the messenger scale @xmath65 and effective susy breaking @xmath66 term . here , gauge couplings are gut - normalized so that @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "gauginos are unified at the unification scale .",
    "the mirage mediation pattern is represented as  @xcite m_i^m & = & ( b_i ) m_3/2 + & & ( b_i ) m_3/2 [ eq : mirage]where @xmath69 is a free parameter and the factor @xmath70 arises from kklt type models  the notation conforms with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "mirage pattern is effectively an interpolation between the msugra class ( @xmath71 ) with @xmath72 and amsb ( @xmath73 ) patterns , and gauginos are unified at an intermediate value @xmath74 or at some intermediate energy scale .",
    "thus , mirage mediation models , typically having @xmath75 , predict the smallest mass ratios among these models ; @xmath76 predicts gluino - to - lsp mass ratio smaller than 3 , and our discovery reach will not apply well .",
    "but if the mirage pattern is induced really by combination of gmsb and amsb as in deflected amsb models  @xcite ( instead of kklt type ) , for example , a wider range of @xmath77 may be viable .",
    "we use nlo results in this paper , and refer to appendix for details of our nlo calculations .",
    "most patterns satisfy our validity conditions and simplifying assumptions ",
    "exceptions are mirage mediation with @xmath78 where a compressed spectrum is obtained . in fig .",

    "[ fig : reach - glupair ] as luminostiy needed for @xmath58 statistical significance in the gluino - to - lsp mass ratio and lsp mass .",
    "we also show amsb and mgmsb predictions .",
    "mirage pattern in principle can predict any value of mass ratio below amsb prediction , but typically predicts mass ratios smaller than mgmsb .",
    "the errors of amsb are estimated as previously explained .",
    "the mgmsb error bands are estimated by varying the renormalization scale and the messenger scale between @xmath79 .",
    "the lower bound implies that the spurion superfield coupling method of expansion in powers of @xmath80 becomes invalid . for mgmsb ,",
    "uncertainties from the renormalization scale and the messenger scale are comparable .",
    "again , the main dependence on lsp mass comes from the scale dependence of gauge couplings .",
    "errors of mgmsb in fig .",
    "[ fig : mratio - reach ] is smaller than that of amsb because scalars are lighter  heavier scalars will modify mgmsb by larger amount as well .    combined with model dependent cosmological and astrophysical bounds on lsp mass , the fig .",
    "[ fig : mratio - reach ] can provide useful discovery prospect of susy breaking mediation models .",
    "3.1 tev wino lsp of amsb model can be probed at lhc200 with @xmath81 of data .",
    "it should be kept in mind that astrophysical constraints may be ruling out winos that make up the full cold dark matter  @xcite , including a 3.1 tev wino with assumed thermal relic abundance ; however , those constraints are dependent on somewhat uncertain halo assumptions , and also dependent upon absolute stability of the wino .",
    "higgsino lsp can also be searched .",
    "if 1tev higgsino is the lsp in a general spectrum , 30 tev lhc can probe up to 6 tev gluino ( equivalently , mass ratio 6 ) with @xmath81 .",
    "500 gev bino lsp in the mgmsb , for example , can be probed with 1000 fb@xmath43 at lhc14 .",
    "the discovery reach in the gluino - to - lsp mass ratio is applicable more generally in a model independent way .",
    "for example , variants of gmsb where gauginos follow gmsb relation ( with proper nlo corrections ) while scalars feel extra susy breaking to become heavier can also be constrained in the same way as mgmsb .",
    "another example is a scenario with more general non - universal gaugino masses at a boundary scale ( or , the unification scale ) that have recently been widely discussed to reduce higgs mass fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "although these types of models may not have discussed gaugino mass patterns , it can still be studied with our approach as long as the gluino is much heavier than its decay products .",
    "another useful property of @xmath26 spectrum is that the peak location is most sensitive to the gluino mass  @xcite as long as the gluino is heavier than lighter gauginos and higgsinos by more than a factor 3 ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : meff ] .",
    "how the gluino decays and the masses of lighter inos are not so important .",
    "thus , the location of a peak can be used to measure gluino mass .",
    "the lsp mass may be measured in precision measurements using leptons in other two - step decays of gluinos as well  @xcite , or by lsp pair production at a future linear collider  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have probed the search capabilities of @xmath0 hadron colliders for gluinos in the context of split supersymmetry , gauge mediation and mirage mediation .",
    "we have found that when the gluino to lsp mass ratio is not more than 10  which is expected since gaugino mass ratios are related to each other through their respective gauge couplings or @xmath82-functions in most scenarios  one can cover the full range of parameters at a 200 tev collider with approximately 1000 @xmath83 of integrated luminosity .",
    "a 100 tev collider is not enough energy to fully cover the parameter space .",
    "indeed , perhaps the most interesting case of wino lsp thermal dark matter with gauginos satisfying the amsb mass hierarchy , a 100 tev collider with even @xmath84 of integrated luminosity is not enough .",
    "our analysis has been based on the @xmath26 approach  @xcite , with no special kinematic variables for the signal applied , nor did we include third - family tagging analysis , which could be useful if third - family particles are more prevalent in the decays of the gluinos in these scenarios , as might be expected  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", there is a vast region of parameter space yet to be explored by the 14 tev lhc and by incrementally higher energy colliders that are still untouched by current experiments , and can have dark matter despite not having the standard thermal history  @xcite .",
    "therefore , discovery is possible at any time , but definitive coverage of the wino lsp scenario through gluino production and decay requires a @xmath85 collider .",
    "definitive coverage of the higgsino lsp scenario is not possible at any collider , since supersymmetric gauge coupling unification and thermal dark matter are viable for degenerate higgsinos at @xmath86 with all other superpartners arbitrarily heavy .",
    "the gluino mass has less reason to be connected a priori to the higgsino mass than it had with the wino mass .",
    "nevertheless , we consider this to be somewhat less likely option since the higgsino mass alternatively would be correlated with the much heavier scalar sector and therefore irrelevant to dark matter concerns and tev physics , leaving gauginos to play that role .",
    "thus , if it is light , it is likely to be accidentally light and correlated with the gaugino masses , leading to gluino decays to higgsinos as a viable search option . in this case",
    "all of our results apply , and ratios of gluino to higgsino can be probed much higher than gluino to wino , only because thermal dark matter higgsinos are much lighter than thermal dark matter winos .    finally , we remark that our analysis is model independent in as much as gluino masses are much heavier than their primary decay products . given that gaugino masses are often correlated with the gauge coupling strengths and @xmath82-function values of their corresponding gauge groups , which is the discussed cases of msugra , mgmsb , amsb and mirage mediation , this strikes us a generic prospect .",

    "gaugino screening theorem is manifest as nlo correction is proportional to gauge coupling itself but not to others .",
    "a second type of nlo corrections is to use two - loop renormalization group equations of mssm ; we refer to rg equations in ref.@xcite .",
    "two - loop running resums next - to - leading logs which are formally the same order as finite one - loop corrections . for amsb , two - loop parts of @xmath4 in eq.([eq : amsb ] )",
    "give dominant corrections to wino and bino masses  @xcite .",
    "it is these finite one - loop terms that are finally added to complete nlo corrections .",
    "this correction defines gaugino pole masses in terms of running gaugino masses .",
    "pole masses are physical observables , and the renormalization scale dependence of gaugino self - energy corrections are cancelled by that of gauge couplings ( at one - loop level in our case ) . in this work ,",
    "we add threshold corrections explicitly by straighforward one - loop feynman diagram calculations without constructing effective theories .",
    "our calculations are based on ref.@xcite , and agree with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "we further generalize in case of different orderings of gauginos and higgsinos ",
    "different orderings have different arguments of threshold log terms .",
    "when sfermions are very heavy , there appear large log terms so that a proper low - energy effective theory should be constructed by matching and running as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , we are content with observing that this uncertainty , by virtue of not specifying the scalar masses precisely , is not large enough to substantively change our results based on the leading order predictions .",
    "generating tails of backgrounds reliably is crucial in this work .",
