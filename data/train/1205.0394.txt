    "mass loss via stellar winds is thought to play a dominant role in the evolution of massive o - type stars , because of the loss of _ mass _ , as winds `` peel off '' the star s",
    "outermost layers ( conti 1976 ) , as well as through the associated loss of _ angular momentum _",
    "( e.g. langer 1998 , meynet & maeder 2002 ) .",
    "however , during the last decade , large uncertainty has been pointed out regarding our quantitative knowledge of the mass - loss rates of massive stars , as stellar winds have been revealed to be clumped , resulting in empirical rates that have been overestimated .    although it had been known for decades that o - type winds are clumped ( lupie & nordsieck 1987 , eversberg et al .",
    "1998 ) , the severity did not appear to be fully recognized until bouret et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and fullerton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) claimed mass - loss reductions of factors @xmath23 - 7 and @xmath220 - 130 respectively in comparison to unclumped h@xmath3 and radio mass - loss rates ( e.g. lamers & leitherer 1993 ) .",
    "the h@xmath3 diagnostics depends on the density squared , and are thus sensitive to clumping , whilst ultraviolet p cygni lines such as pv are _ in_sensitive to clumping as these depend linearly on the density .",
    "the above - mentioned bouret et al . and",
    "fullerton et al .",
    "analyses were based on models where the wind is divided into a portion of the wind containing all the material with a volume filling factor @xmath4 ( the reciprocal of the clumping factor ) , whilst the remainder of the wind is assumed to be void .",
    "this pure _ micro_-clumping approach is probably an oversimplification of the real situation , but it provides interesting insights into the potential mass - loss rate reductions .    in reality ,",
    "clumped winds are likely porous , with a range of clump sizes , masses , and optical depths .",
    "_ macro_-clumping and porosity have been investigated with respect to both the spectral analyses ( e.g. oskinova et al .",
    "2007 , sunqvist et al .",
    "2010 , surlan et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as the radiative driving ( muijres et al .",
    "the upshot from these studies is that o star mass - loss rates may only be reduced by a moderate factor of @xmath23 ( repolust et al .",
    "2004 , puls et al .",
    "2008 ) , which would bring their clumping properties in agreement with those of wolf - rayet ( wr ) winds , for which similar moderate clumping factors have been derived ( hamann & koesterke 1998 ) .",
    "the latter are based on the analysis of emission line wings due to electron scattering , which have the advantage that they do not depend on detailed ionization fractions and abundances of trace elements .",
    "these moderate clumping factors would imply that massive star evolution modelling is not affected , as current state - of - the - art rotating stellar models ( e.g. georgy et al .",
    "2011 ; brott et al .",
    "2011 ) already employ moderately reduced rates via the theoretical relations of vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    in light of the severe mass - loss reductions claimed e.g. by fullerton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , smith & owocki ( 2006 ) argued that the integrated mass loss from stationary stellar winds for very massive stars ( vms ) above @xmath050  may be vastly insufficient to explain their role as the progenitors of wr stars and stripped - envelope ibc supernovae . instead , smith & owocki argued that the bulk of vms mass loss is likely of an eruptive rather than a stationary nature .",
    "in particular , they highlighted the alternative option of eruptive mass loss during the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase .",
    "in view of the new porosity results , the arguments of smith & owocki ( 2006 ) however seem to have lost weight .",
    "furthermore , quantitative estimates on the integrated amount of eruptive mass loss are hard to obtain as both the eruption frequency , and the amounts of mass lost per eruption span a wide range ( of a factor 100 ) with lbv nebular mass estimates varying from @xmath20.1  in pcygni to @xmath210  in @xmath5car , as discussed by smith & owocki ( 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , the energies required to produce such giant mass eruptions are very high ( @xmath6erg ) , and their energy source is unknown . soker ( 2004 ) discussed that the energy and angular momentum required for @xmath5car great eruption can not be explained within a single - star scenario .",
    "whilst stationary winds in o and wr stars are ubiquitous , it is not at all clear if lbv - type objects like @xmath5car have encountered a special evolution ( such as a merger ) or if all massive stars go through eruptive mass - loss phases . on the other hand , for the most massive main - sequence wnh stars ( crowther et al . 2010 , bestenlehner et al . 2011 ) there is both theoretical and empirical evidence for strong eddington parameter @xmath7-dependent ( see definition eq.[eq_gamma ] ) mass loss ( grfener et al .",
    "2011 ) . for vms",
    "the role of stationary mass loss has thus increased rather than decreased in recent years .    in summary ,",
    "the relevant roles of eruptive versus stationary mass loss seem rather uncertain and unsettled at the current time .",
    "there are ongoing debates as to whether wind clumping reduces the mass - loss rates by moderate factors of @xmath02 - 3 , such that stellar evolution would not be affected , or by more severe factors of order @xmath210 . in the latter case ,",
    "line - driving would become negligible and alternatives such as eruptive mass loss would need to be considered .    in order to address the relative role of wind versus eruptive mass loss , it would be beneficial to be able to calibrate either one of them . at the moment",
    "both stellar wind and eruptive mass loss could be inaccurate by factors of 10 , and possibly even more . in this letter ,",
    "we attempt to alleviate this problem by presenting a methodology that involves a model - independent mass - loss indicator , the transition mass - loss rate @xmath1  located right at the transition from optically thin to optically thick stellar winds . martins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found two mass - loss relations for vms arches cluster stars , one for the of stars and one for the late - type wnh stars respectively .",
    "the fact that wolf - rayet stars with wnh spectral classification have optical depth larger than one has already been discussed in literature ( e.g. grfener & hamann 2008 ) , and one might thus expect to witness a transition from optically thin o - type winds to optically thick wolf - rayet winds .",
    "vink et al . ( 2011 ) discovered a sudden change in the slope of the mass - loss versus @xmath7 relation at the transition from o - type ( optically thin ) to wr - type ( optically thick ) winds .",
    "interestingly , this transition was found to occur for a wind efficiency parameter @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10/(@xmath11 ) of order unity .",
    "this key result from monte carlo modelling that the transition from o to wr - type mass loss coincides with @xmath12 , can also be found analytically ( sect.[sec_anal ] ) . and",
    "the result can be utilized to `` calibrate '' wind mass loss in an almost model independent manner ( sect.[sec_arches ] ) .",
    "netzer & elitzur ( 1993 ) and lamers & cassinelli ( 1999 ; hereafter lc99 ) give general momentum considerations for dust - driven winds ( see lc99 pages 152 - 153 ) that can also be applied to line - driven winds .",
    "the integral form of the momentum equation contains four terms ( eq .",
    "7.5 of lc99 ) .",
    "because hydrostatic equilibrium is a good approximation for the subsonic part of the wind , and the gas pressure gradient is small beyond the sonic point , lc99 argue that the second and third terms are negligible compared to the first and fourth , resulting in :    @xmath13    employing the mass - continuity equation @xmath14 , one obtains    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the sonic radius and @xmath17 the eddington factor with respect to the total flux - mean opacity @xmath18 :    @xmath19    using the wind optical depth @xmath20 , one obtains    @xmath21    where it is assumed that @xmath7 is significantly larger than one , and the factor @xmath22 is thus close to unity ( lc99 s second assumption ) , resulting in    @xmath23    one can now derive a key condition for the wind efficiency number @xmath5    @xmath24    the key point of our letter is that we can employ the unique condition @xmath25 right at the transition from optically thin o - star winds to optically - thick wr winds , and obtain a _ model - independent _ @xmath26 . in other words , if we were to have an empirical data - set available that contains luminosity determinations for o and wr stars , we can obtain the transition mass - loss rate @xmath1 simply by considering the transition luminosity @xmath27 and the terminal velocity @xmath28 representing the transition point from o to wr stars :    @xmath29    we note that this transition point can be obtained by purely spectroscopic means , _ independent _ of any assumptions regarding wind clumping .      [ tab_models ]    in the above analysis we made two assumptions that we wish to check with numerical tests involving sophisticated hydrodynamic wind models ( from grfener & hamann 2008 ) and simpler @xmath30-type velocity laws , commonly used in o / wr wind modelling .",
    "the results are compiled in tab.1 .",
    "we first confirm lc99 s first assumption through the comparison of @xmath5 , determined from @xmath26 and @xmath31 , to the approximate @xmath32 values as computed from the right - hand - side of integral in eq.[eq_lc99 ] , where @xmath33 .",
    "evidently , the values of @xmath5 and @xmath32 agree at the few percent level , and the first lc99 approximation is verified .",
    "second , we investigate the assumption that the term @xmath34 in eq.[eq_gaga ] is close to unity by numerical integration of @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain a correction factor @xmath36 , which we define by @xmath37 with this definition eq.[eq_eta ] becomes @xmath38    to compute the integral numerically , we need to obtain the density @xmath39 , and the flux - mean opacity @xmath40 in the stellar wind ( @xmath17 follows from eq.([eq_gamma ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic wind models of grfener & hamann ( 2008 ) have these quantities directly available .",
    "we have performed a direct computation for the first model ( hyd ) in tab.1 for the galactic wnh star wr22 ( grfener & hamann 2008 ) .",
    "for this model we obtain @xmath41 .",
    "this value is lower than , but of the order of , unity .",
    "the terminal wind speed in this model is significantly lower than the observed value for wr22 ( 980km / s vs. 1785km / s ) .",
    "consequently , our derived @xmath36 is likely on the low side .",
    "we expect @xmath42 to be connected to the ratio @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .    here",
    "we follow a model - independent approach , adopting @xmath30-type velocity laws .",
    "the mean opacity @xmath45 then follows from the resulting radiative acceleration @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath46 follows from the prescribed density @xmath39 and velocity structures @xmath48 via the equation of motion @xmath49 where we assume a grey temperature structure to compute the gas pressure @xmath50 .",
    "we note that these results are completely independent of any assumptions regarding wind porosity , or the chemical composition of the wind material .",
    "the _ only _ assumption that goes into these considerations is that the winds are radiatively driven .",
    "the resulting mean opacity @xmath45 consequently captures all physical effects that could potentially affect the radiative driving .",
    "the obtained values for the correction factor @xmath36 are summarized in tab.1 .",
    "the first three models in tab.1 represent a consistency test with the hydrodynamic model for wr22 . using a beta law with @xmath51 , and the same @xmath31",
    ", we obtain almost exactly the same @xmath36 as for the hydrodynamic model , justifying our @xmath30-law approach , which we employ in the following . now employing the _ observed _  and therefore likely close to correct  value of @xmath31 ( and a correspondingly increased @xmath26",
    ", we obtain @xmath52 .    to get a handle on the overall behaviour of this factor @xmath36",
    ", we computed a series of wind models for a range of stellar parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 , with wind efficiencies around the transition region ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "remarkably , the resulting values of @xmath36 depend _ only _ on the adopted values of @xmath56 and @xmath30 . for @xmath57",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 0.7 , 0.6 respectively for @xmath59 , 1.0 , 1.5 , where the last value is probably most appropriate ( vink et al .",
    "overall , we derive values of @xmath60 in the range 0.4 - 0.8 , with a mean value of 0.6 .",
    "we note that the error on this number @xmath60 is within the uncertainty of the luminosity determinations described in the next section .    for transition objects with @xmath61",
    "we thus expect that @xmath62 , i.e.  the transition between o and wr spectral types should occur at mass - loss rates of @xmath63 the fact that the correction factor is within a factor of two of our idealized approach ( eq .  [ eq_transm ] ) is highly encouraging .",
    "we stress that this number is independent of any potential model deficiencies , as we have used the observed values of @xmath31 in this analysis .",

    "dependence on stellar mass , as for masses in the range 40 - 80@xmath85 , the vink et al .",
    "mass - loss rate varies by at most 0.04 dex .    in summary",
    ", we have three independent mass - loss rate determinations that agree within a factor of two .",
    "this means that our concept of the transition mass - loss rate has indeed been able to test the accuracy of current mass - loss estimates by stellar winds .",
    "now that we have calibrated stellar wind mass loss in the high mass and luminosity regime , we assess the role of stellar wind mass loss for massive star evolution . for a 60@xmath85 star ,",
    "the main sequence lifetime is @xmath03 myrs ( e.g. weidner & vink 2010 and references therein ) . with a stationary mass - loss rate of @xmath86 @xmath87 as derived for the transition mass - loss rate in sect.[sec_arches ] , this means such an object will lose @xmath030 , i.e. half its initial mass , already on the main sequence during core hydrogen burning .",
    "we have not yet addressed the new concept of @xmath7 dependent mass loss , nor any additional stellar wind mass loss during the subsequent core - helium burning wr phase . in other words ,",
    "solar - metallicity 60@xmath85 stars are expected to lose the bulk of their initial masses through stellar winds , leaving very little ( if any ) space for additional ( e.g. eruptive ) mass loss .",
