    "in recent years , complex networks attract special attentions from diverse fields of research [ 1 ] .",
    "though several novel measurements , such as degree distribution , shortest connecting paths and clustering coefficients , have been used to characterize complex networks , we are still far from complete understanding of all peculiarities of their topological structures .",
    "finding new characteristics is still an essential role at present time .",
    "describe the structure of a complex network with the associated adjacency matrix . map this complex network with @xmath10 nodes to a large molecule , the nodes as atoms and the edges as couplings between the atoms .",
    "denote the states and the corresponding site energies of the atoms with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , repsectively .",
    "consider a simple condition where the hamiltonian of the molecule reads ,    @xmath13    where ,    @xmath14    by this way a complex network is mapped to a quantum system , and the corresponding associated adjacency matrix to the hamiltonian of this quantum system .",
    "the structure of a complex network determines its spectrum .",
    "the characteristics of this spectrum can reveal the structure symmetries , which can be employed as global measurements of the corresponding complex network [ 2 - 12 ] . in our recent papers [ 13 - 16 ] ,",
    "several temporal series analysis methods are used to extract characteristic features embedded in spectra of complex networks .    in the present paper , a new concept , called diffusion factorial moment ( dfm ) ,",
    "is proposed to obtain scale features in spectra of complex networks .",
    "it is found that these spectra display scale invariance , which can be employed as a global measurement of complex networks in a unified way .",
    "it may also be helpful for us to construct a unified model of complex networks .",
    "represent a complex network with its adjacency matrix : @xmath15 .",
    "the main algebraic tool that we will use for the analysis of complex networks will be the spectrum , i.e. , the set of eigenvalues of the complex network s adjacency matrix , called the spectrum of the complex network , denoted with @xmath16 . connecting the beginning and the end of this spectrum , we can obtain a set of delay register vectors as [ 13 ] ,    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    considering each vector as a trajectory of a particle during @xmath22 time units , all the above vectors can be regarded as a diffusion process for a system with @xmath23 particles [ 17 ] .",
    "accordingly , for each time denoted with @xmath22 we can reckon the distribution of the displacements of all the particles as the state of the system at time @xmath22 .    dividing the possible range of displacements into @xmath24 bins , the probability distribution function ( pdf )",
    "can be approximated with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of particles whose displacements fall in the @xmath27th bin at time @xmath22 . to obtain a suitable @xmath24 ,",
    "the size of a bin is chosen to be a fraction of the variance , @xmath28 .    if the series constructed with the nearest neighbor level spacings , @xmath29 , is a set of homogeneous random values without correlations with each other , the pdf should tend to be a gaussian form when the time @xmath22 becomes large enough .",
    "deviations of the pdf from the gaussian form reflect the correlations in the time series . here",
    ", we are specially interested in the scale features in spectra of complex networks .",
    "generally , the scale features in spectra of complex networks can be described with the concept of probability moment ( pm ) defined as [ 18 ] ,    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the probability for a particle occurring in the @xmath27th bin .",
    "assume the pdf takes the form ,    @xmath32    an easy algebra leads to ,    @xmath33    if the considered series is completely uncorrelated , the resulting diffusion process will be very close to the condition of ordinary diffusion , where @xmath34 and the function @xmath35 in the pdf is a gaussian function of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 can reflect the departure of the diffusion process from this ordinary diffusion condition [ 19 ] .",
    "the extreme condition is the ballistic diffusions , whose pdfs read @xmath38 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 at this condition are @xmath39 .",
    "but the approximation of pdf , @xmath40 , in the above computational procedure will induce statistical fluctuations due to the finite number of particles , which may become a fatal problem when we deal with the spectrum of a complex network .",
    "the dynamical information may be merged by the strong statistical fluctuations completely . capturing the dynamical information from a finite number of cases",
    "is a non - trivial task .",
    "this problem is firstly considered by a. bialas and r. peschanski in analyzing the process of high energy collisions , where only a small number of cases can be available . a concept called factorial moment ( fm )",
    "is proposed to find the intermittency ( self - similar ) structures embedded in the pdf of states [ 18,20 - 24 ] .",
    "the definition of fm reads ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the number of the bins the displacement range being divided into and @xmath43 the number of particles whose displacements fall in the @xmath27th bin .    stimulated by the concept of fm , we propose in this paper a new concept called diffusion factorial moment ( dfm ) , which reads ,    @xmath44",
    "herein we present a simple argument for the ability of dfm to filter out the statistical fluctuations due to finite number of cases [ 20,21].the statistical fluctuations will obey bernoulli and poisson distributions for a system containing uncertain and certain total number of particles , respectively . for a system containing uncertain total number of particles ,",
    "the distribution of particles in the bins can be expressed as ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 that is to say ,    @xmath48    and consequently , @xmath49 becomes ,    @xmath50    therefore , dfm can reveal the strong dynamical fluctuations embedded in a time series and filter out the statistical fluctuations effectively .",
    "we will use the dfm instead of the pm to obtain the scale features in spectrum of a complex network .",
    "it should be pointed out that the scale features in our dfm is completely different from that in fm .",
    "the fm reveals the self - similar structures with respect to the number of the bins the possible range of the displacements being divided into , i.e. , the scale is the displacement . in dfm ,",
    "the considered scale is the time @xmath22 . at time @xmath22",
    ", the state of the system is , @xmath51 .    in one of our recent works [ 13 ] ,",
    "joint use of the detrended fluctuation approach ( dfa ) and the diffusion entropy ( de ) is employed to find the correlation features embedded in spectra of complex networks . in that paper",
    "we review briefly the relation between the scale invariance exponent , @xmath6 , and the long - range correlation exponent @xmath52 . for fractional brownian motions ( fbm ) and",
    "levy walk processes , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . generally , we can not derive a relation between these two exponents .",
    "herein , we present the relation between the concepts of dfm and de . from the probability moment in @xmath55",
    "we can reach the corresponding tsallis entropy , @xmath56 , which reads ,    @xmath57    a trivial computation leads to the relation between the de , ( denoted with @xmath58 ) , the pm and the tsallis entropy , as follows ,    @xmath59    hence dfm can detect multi - fractal features in spectra of complex networks by adjusting the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the de is just a special condition of dfm with @xmath61 .",
