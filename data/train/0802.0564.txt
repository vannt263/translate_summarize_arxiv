    "recently , there are a great interest for developing the computer device .",
    "this is mainly due to the complications of the problems which we are usually facing and urgently need to find their solutions @xcite . to overcome these problems we have to find a computer device with high capacity and speed or we have to develop a new kind of computer has such properties .",
    "this in fact means that we need one has a large memory , an adequate processor and a large hard disk .",
    "this stimulated and encouraged the researcher to seek for another kind of computer different to that of the classical one , that is the quantum computer .",
    "however , in the quantum information and more precisely in the quantum computer there is an important question would be raised , what is the speed of sending information from nod to the other one that to reach the final output .",
    "since the information is coded in a density operator , therefore we ask how fast the density operator will change its orthogonality . in other words , we search for a minimum time needed for a quantum system to pass from one orthogonal state to another @xcite . to perform this task",
    "we need qubit contains the information to evolve through a unitary operator where the carrier transforms it from one nod to the other .    for entangled qubit pair",
    ", one can see the operators cause a decay of entanglement @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that the classical noise leads to what is called entanglement sudden death @xcite .",
    "moreover , the time - dependent interaction of a single qubit with a field can also produce such a phenomena as well as along - lived entanglement@xcite .",
    "this means that there are different factors would be involved and affect the transmission speed and consequently the information .",
    "recently the efforts in quantum information research are directed towards improving the performance of single qubit interaction .",
    "also , evolution speed ( maximum transition rate between orthogonal state ) and the time evolution of some models has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main purpose for the present communication is to consider the interaction between a single qubit and an external field for the classical treatment and the interaction between a single qubit and cavity field for the quantum treatment .",
    "this is to shed some light on the general behavior of the interaction process and its relationship with the speed of the computation @xcite ( maximum number of orthogonal states that the system can pass through per unit time ) , speed of orthogonality @xcite ( minimum time for a quantum state @xmath1 to evolve into orthogonal state @xmath2 where @xmath3 ) and speed of evolution @xcite ( maximum transition rate between orthogonal state ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "@xmath4 , we consider the classical treatment , where we calculate the general form of the time evaluation of the density operator . the quantum interaction of the qubit will be considered in sec .",
    "@xmath5 , where we introduce the unitary operator in an adequate form .",
    "also , we obtain the final state by means of the bloch vectors .",
    "also we study the effect of the field parameters on the speed of the quantum computation .",
    "finally , our conclusion is given in sec @xmath6",
    "let us start out with a short reminder on a general form of the density operator of a qubit with the aid of analogs of pauli s spin vector operator @xmath7 .",
    "this row vector refer to the three dimensional vector @xcite @xmath8where @xmath9 are orthonormal vectors of the three coordinate axes to which the components @xmath10 are referred and @xmath10 are pauli matrices satisfying the commutation relation @xmath11=2i\\sigma _ { k},$ ] where @xmath12 form an even permutation of @xmath13 . in this case",

    "to clarify our idea let us assume that the user alice has encoded some information in her qubit which is defined by @xmath24using the time evolution of the unitary operator , ( [ uni ] ) one can transform @xmath25 into @xmath26 from which the new bloch vectors take the form , @xmath27let us assume that alice has prepared her qubit such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]    in fact , these states are widely used in the quantum information tasks .",
    "for example , one may consult a recent applications given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the meantime",
    "it would be interesting to employ the hamiltonian given by equation ( 12 ) that to discuss the speed of computation .",
    "this is extensively used in the field of quantum information to describe the interaction between field and qubit , particularly for investigating the loss of entanglement after propagation in a quantum noisy channel .",
    "furthermore , compare with the classical treatment the interaction hamiltonian contains three different parameters to control the dynamics of the system , @xmath61 the detuning parameter , @xmath87 the coupling constant , and the mean photon number @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "these parameters are involved through the rabi frequency @xmath89 as well as in the bloch vectors themselves .",
    "this would give us a wide range of variety to discuss the variation in @xmath90 resultant of change one of these parameters .",
    "to do so we have numerically calculated the overlap between the initial and the final states of @xmath45 . for example , to see the effect of the coupling parameter @xmath78we have considered the number of photons @xmath91 , and the detuning parameter @xmath92 while @xmath93    in this case and from figure ( 2a ) we can see nearly perfect overlap between both of @xmath54 and @xmath55 as well as coincidences at the horizontal line showing high speed . increase the value of @xmath87 such that @xmath94 leads to slight increase in the speed of computation , beside increases in one of the projectors value , see figure ( 2b ) .",
    "more increases in the coupling parameter @xmath95 shows increasing in the speed of computation but with less coincidences between the two projectors , see figure ( 2c ) .",
    "more increasing in the coupling value @xmath96 leads to more decreasing in the speed of computation but with regular increasing in both projectors value .",
    "this means that there is a certain value ( critical value ) of the coupling parameter where the speed of computation reaches its maximum and then starts to slow down . to examine the effect of",
    "the mean photon number we have considered the case in which @xmath97 keeping the other parameters unchange as in figure ( 2a ) . in this case we observe no change in the speed of orthogonality and the behavior in general is the same as before , however , there is increasing in the amplitude for one of the projectors , see figure ( 3a ) .",
    "however , if we decrease the value of the detuning parameter @xmath98 drastic change can be realized .",
    "for instance , we can see decreasing in the number of the oscillations period , increasing in one of the projector amplitude , in addition to decrease in the speed of computation , see figure ( 3b ) .",
    "thus we come to conclusion if one increases the value of the detuning parameter then the speed of the interaction increases .",
    "this result is in agreement with that given by montangero simon , where they investigated the dynamics of entanglement in quantum computer with imperfections .",
    "in the above sections of the present paper we have considered the problem of speed computation in quantum information . the problem has been handled from two different point of view ; where we have considered both of classical and quantum treatments .",
    "the main concentration was on how to improve and control the computation s speed in each case separately . for the classical treatment",
    "it has been shown that the speed of computation is proportional with the total value of the external field . however , for quantum treatment we have seen that the speed of computation is sensitive to the variation of the coupling parameter and the detuning parameter . in the meantime we found the mean photon number does not play any role with the speed of computation but it is just effect the amplitude of the projectors .",
    "this in fact would turn our attention to look for the atom - atom interaction to be discussed in a forthcoming work .",
