    "pure neutron matter is the natural first approximation to the baryonic matter that composes the bulk of neutron stars . at very low densities below neutron drip , ( i.e. where the fermi wave vector is roughly , @xmath2 @xmath3 ) neutron star matter is conjectured to be nuclei surrounded by a relativistic gas of electrons@xcite . at higher densities",
    "the matter becomes liquid and very neutron rich .",
    "here we study matter at fermi wave vector @xmath4 where it is reasonable to approximate it as pure neutron matter , and also extend some of our results into the lower density regime in order to compare with other calculations .    at these densities",
    "the interaction is dominated by the @xmath1 channel with a large and negative scattering length , @xmath5 .",
    "the product of the effective range and the fermi wave vector is of order unity , so , while the form of interaction can not be neglected , it becomes less important .",
    "analysis of the phase shifts of the neutron - neutron @xmath1 interaction indicates that neutrons should pair and form a superfluid .",
    "therefore the superfluid phase must be included when investigating the equation of state in this regime .",
    "many methods have been used to approximately calculate the equation of state .",
    "one class of methods uses skyrme or relativistic mean - field methods that use effective interactions that have been fit to the properties of nuclei .",
    "however , even those calculations that describe neutron - rich nuclei reasonably well , give rather different equations of state for pure neutron matter@xcite .",
    "we instead use a nonrelativistic hamiltonian with two- and three - body interactions .",
    "all modern accurate two - body interactions fit the nijmegen data@xcite within experimental errors and should give essentially the same equation of state at low density . at longer range ,",
    "these interactions are dominated by the one - pion exchange and have strong spin - isospin dependence , which must be included for accurate predictions .",
    "three- and higher - body interactions are less well known but in this density regime they are small .",
    "our calculations extend the work we first reported in ref .",
    "the ground state of neutron matter is computed using the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo @xcite ( afdmc ) algorithm ; it is an extension of the diffusion monte carlo method@xcite , and green s function monte carlo method@xcite .",
    "these monte carlo algorithms are very well suited to project a trial wave function onto the ground state in order to study the ground state properties of a system .",
    "the green s function monte carlo method has been used to study the properties of light nuclei with very high accuracy@xcite .",
    "the advantage of the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo method over the green s function monte carlo method is that it can be extended to larger nuclear systems ; in fact it has been used to calculate properties of heavy nuclei@xcite , neutron - rich isotopes@xcite and neutron@xcite and nuclear matter@xcite by simulating systems with upwards of one hundred nucleons .",
    "the equation of state of neutron matter in the low - density regime has been a subject of many previous calculations@xcite . while in this regime ,",
    "different hamiltonians and different methods give similar behavior for the energy as a function of the density , there are appreciable differences in other important properties . in particular , the value of the @xmath1 superfluid energy gap is at present not well clarified and strongly depends on the hamiltonian and the solution method@xcite . in this paper we focus on both the energy and the energy gap by considering a fully realistic hamiltonian , and solve for the ground state using the afdmc technique . as a starting point for the calculation we considered two forms for the trial wave function .",
    "the first is a filled fermi sea having the properties of a normal fermi liquid which we will call the normal phase .",
    "the second has neutrons paired in the @xmath1 channel with a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid structure@xcite . at a fixed density , we find that the superfluid phase of the system is only marginally favored compared to the normal phase . however , to calculate the superfluid energy gap , the bcs structure must be used .",
    "we study the ground state of neutron matter beginning with the non  relativistic nuclear hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass of the neutron , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two and three  body potentials .",
    "such a form for the hamiltonian ( with the kinetic energy modified to take into account the mass difference of the neutron and proton ) has been shown to describe properties of light nuclei in a good agreement with experimental data ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all the degrees of freedom responsible for the interaction between nucleons ( such as the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc . ) are integrated out and included in @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    at present ,",
    "several realistic two - nucleon interactions fit scattering data with very high precision .",
    "we use the two - nucleon potentials belonging to the argonne family  @xcite . such interactions are written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are spin  isospin dependent operators .",
    "the number of operators @xmath15 characterizes the interaction ; the most accurate for the argonne family is the argonne av18 with m=18  @xcite .",
    "here we consider a simpler form derived from av18 , namely the av8@xmath16  @xcite with a smaller number of operators .",
    "for many systems , the difference between this simpler form and the full av18 potential can be computed perturbatively  @xcite , as has been done in all green s function monte carlo calculations to date .",
    "most of the contribution of the two - nucleon interaction is due to one - pion exchange between nucleons , but the effect of other mesons exchanges as well as some phenomenological terms are also included .",
    "the eight @xmath14 operators in av8@xmath16 are given by the four central components @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the tensor @xmath21 , the tensor@xmath22 component @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , the spin  orbit @xmath25 and the spin  orbit@xmath22 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the relative angular momentum and the total spin of the pair @xmath29 .",
    "all the parameters describing the radial functions of each operator in av18 are fit to nucleon - nucleon scattering data below 350 mev in the nijmegen database  @xcite .",
    "the av8@xmath16 interaction is obtained by starting from av18 and making an isoscalar projection .",
    "it is refit in order to keep the most important features of av18 in the scattering data and the properties of the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the three ",
    "nucleon interaction is essential to overcome the underbinding of nuclei with more than two nucleons . while the two - nucleon interaction is fit to scattering data and correctly gives the deuteron binding energy , it is not sufficient to describe the ground state of light nuclei with three or more nucleons .",
    "the urbana - ix ( uix ) potential corrects this , and was fit to obtain the correct triton energy using green s function monte carlo and to correctly reproduce the expected saturation energy of nuclear matter within the fermi hypernetted - chain approximation  @xcite .",
    "it contains a fujita ",
    "miyazawa term  @xcite that describes the exchange of two pions between three nucleons , with the creation of an intermediate excited @xmath12 state .",
    "again , a phenomenological part is added to sum all the other neglected terms .",
    "the generic form of uix is : @xmath30 the fujita - miyazawa term  @xcite is spin  isospin dependent : @xmath31 [ { \\boldsymbol{\\tau } } _ i\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau } } _ j,{\\boldsymbol{\\tau } } _ j\\cdot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau } } _ k]\\big ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 operators describe the one pion exchange ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the phenomenological part of uix is @xmath33 the factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 are kept as fitting parameters .",
    "other forms of three - nucleon interaction , called the illinois forces  @xcite , which includes three  nucleon feynman diagrams with two-@xmath12 intermediate states , are available . unfortunately they provide unrealistic overbinding of neutron systems when the density increases  @xcite and they do not seem to describe , realistically , higher density ( i.e. @xmath36 @xmath37 ) nucleonic systems .",
    "however in the low  density regime considered in this paper , the contribution of the three ",
    "body interaction is very small compared to the total energy of the system , so that the small errors in the uix interaction should have negligible contributions to the equation of state and energy gap .",
    "uniform neutron matter is simulated by solving the ground state of a fixed number @xmath38 of neutrons in a periodic box , whose volume is fixed by the density of the system .",
    "the ground state of the system is calculated by means of the afdmc algorithm  @xcite .",
    "diffusion monte carlo projects out the lowest - energy state from a trial wave function @xmath39 by a propagation in imaginary time : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization factor . in the @xmath42",
    "limit the only component of @xmath39 that survives is the lowest - energy one not orthogonal to @xmath39 : @xmath43 the evolution in imaginary time is performed by solving the integral equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the green s function of the hamiltonian that contains a diffusion term , coming from the kinetic operator in @xmath46 , and a branching term from the potential .",
    "the exact form of @xmath45 is unknown , but it can be accurately approximated in the limit of @xmath47 .",
    "the above integral equation is then solved iteratively , with a small time step , for a sufficiently large number of steps . a detailed description of the algorithm as well as the importance sampling technique used to reduce the variance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the presence of spin operators in the hamiltonian requires a summation of all possible good spin states in the wave function  @xcite .",
    "this summation grows exponentially with the number of neutrons ; for example , for a system of 14 neutrons the computation of @xmath48 is a sum of squares of @xmath49 spin amplitudes .",
    "the explicit summation of spin states is performed in green s function monte carlo , but not in afdmc , calculations where the spin states are sampled using monte carlo techniques  @xcite .",
    "this sampling is performed by reducing the quadratic dependence of spin operators in the exponential to a linear form by means of the hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "the effect of an exponential of a linear combination of spin operators consists of a rotation of the spinor for each neutron during the propagation . in order to have an efficient algorithm , the trial function",
    "must be chosen so that it can be efficiently evaluated when each neutron is in a specific position and spinor state .",
    "since both positions and spins can be sampled , the afdmc method can be used to solve for the ground state of much larger systems  more than one - hundred neutrons  than green s function monte carlo with full spin summations .",
    "more detailed explanations of the afdmc method and how to include the full two- and three - nucleon interactions in the propagator can be found in refs .",

    "the function @xmath58 entering in the so called jastrow part of the trial wave function has only the role of reducing the overlap of neutrons and thereby reducing the energy variance .",
    "since it does not change the phase of the wave function , it does not influence the computed energy value in projections methods .",
    "the function @xmath58 is computed as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the antisymmetric part @xmath59 of the trial wave function is usually given by the ground state of non  interacting fermions ( fermi gas ) , which is written as a slater determinant of single particle functions .",

    "bcs pairing correlations can substantially change the nodal structure of a trial wave function  @xcite .",
