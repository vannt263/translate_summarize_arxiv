    "among the methods developed in the past , we can list regularization methods as the richardson - lucy iteration @xcite , truncated singular value decomposition @xcite and tikhonov regularization @xcite , or methods as the maximum entropy deconvolution @xcite or the _ cosmic inversion _ methods @xcite . recently",

    "all these methods provide hint for a pps which may not be as simple as a power - law .",
    "while the significance of the deviations is small for some cases , it is interesting to note that the cmb temperature power spectra as measured by both wmap @xcite and planck @xcite show similar results : the differences from the power - law are located in the low multipole region .",
    "these deviations could arise from some statistical fluctuations , or , instead , result from a non - standard inflationary mechanism .",
    "if the features we observe are the result of a non - standard inflationary mechanism , we may be using an incomplete parameterization for the pps in our cosmological analyses .",
    "it has been shown that this could lead to biased results in the cosmological constraints of different quantities .",
    "namely , the constraints on the dark radiation properties @xcite or on non - gaussianities @xcite can be distorted , leading to spurious conclusions . in this work",

    "the description of the cosmological model may require a non - standard power - law primordial power spectrum ( pps ) of scalar perturbations generated during the inflationary phase at the beginning of the universe .",
    "several analyses have considered the possible deviations from the pps power - law exploiting both the wmap and the planck data measurements of the cmb temperature power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "even if the significance for such deviations is small , it leaves some freedom for the pps assumed form .",
    "here we test the robustness of the cosmological bounds on several cosmological parameters when the pps is allowed to have a model - independent shape , that we describe using a ` pchip `  function to interpolate a series of twelve or eight nodes @xmath59 .",
    "we have explored the impact of a non - canonical pps in several different extensions of the @xmath0  model , varying the effective number of relativistic species , the masses of the active and the light sterile neutrinos , the neutrino perturbations and a thermal axion mass .",
    "concerning the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath57 , we find that the results are in good agreement with the standard value of 3.046 , if one assumes the standard power - law pps . increasing @xmath57  has the main effect of increasing the silk damping of the cmb spectrum at small scales and",
    "therefore it is easy change the pps shape at that scales to compensate the increased damping .",
    "this results in a strong degeneracy between the relevant ` pchip `  pps nodes and @xmath57 . as a consequence of volume effects in the bayesian analyses ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath57  are significantly loosened .",
    "for some data combinations we obtain @xmath162 allowed at 95% cl . however , the ` pchip `  pps nodes and @xmath57  effects can not be compensated in the polarization spectra , in particular in the case of the te cross - correlation .",
    "this is the reason for which the inclusion of cmb polarization measurements in the analyses allows to break the degeneracies and to restore the @xmath57  bounds very close to 3.046 for all the data combinations , with @xmath163 excluded at more than 95% cl for all the datasets .    in the minimal three active massive neutrinos scenario ,",
    "the constraints on @xmath67  are relaxed with respect to the pps power - law ones .",
    "this is due to the degeneracy between @xmath67  and the nodes @xmath70 and @xmath71 , that correspond to the scales at which the early integrated sachs - wolfe ( eisw ) effect contributes to the cmb spectrum .",
    "the tightest limit we find is @xmath164 ev at 95% cl from the combination of planck  tt , te , ee+lowp+bao data .",
    "the situation is not significantly changed when the effective number and the neutrino masses are varied simultaneously , since the degeneracies with the pps parameterization are different for these two neutrino parameters .",
    "their constraints are slightly relaxed as a consequence of the increased parameter space .",
    "the strongest bounds on @xmath67  arise from the planck  tt , te , ee+lowp+bao dataset , for which we obtain @xmath165 ( power - law pps ) and @xmath166 ( ` pchip `  pps ) .",
    "for @xmath57 , all the data combinations including the planck cmb polarization measurements give similar constraints , summarized as @xmath90 at 95% cl .    in the case",
    "in which we consider both massive neutrinos and massive sterile neutrino species , the bounds on @xmath67 , @xmath101 and @xmath57  are weaker for the ` pchip`approach when compared to the standard power - law pps parameterization .",
    "this occurs because there exist degeneracies between these parameters and some nodes of the ` pchip `  pps .",
    "the most stringent constraints on the active and the sterile neutrino parameters are obtained from the combination of planck  tt , te , ee+lowp+bao , for which we find @xmath167 ev , @xmath168 ev and @xmath169 at 95% cl in the power - law pps description and @xmath170 ev , @xmath171 ev and @xmath172 at 95% cl within the ` pchip`pps parameterization .",
    "regarding the thermal axion scenario , we notice that the axion mass bounds are largely relaxed when using the ` pchip`approach . when including the small scale cmb polarization we find a further weakening of the axion mass constraints : the reduced volume of the posterior distribution for small axion masses ( @xmath112 )",
    "is translated into a broadening of the marginalized constraints towards higher values for @xmath112 .",
    "the strongest bound we find on the thermal axion mass within the ` pchip`approach is @xmath127 ev at 95% cl when considering the planck tt+lowp+bao data combination ( while , in the power - law scenario , @xmath173 ev at 95% cl ) .",
    "finally , when including massive neutrinos in addition to the thermal axions , we find that , while the bounds on the thermal axion mass are unaffected , the constraints on the total neutrino mass are tighter than those obtained without thermal axions .",
    "the strongest bounds we find for the thermal axion mass and the total neutrino mass in the ` pchip`approach are @xmath174 ev at 95% cl and @xmath143 ev at 95% cl , when considering the planck tt+lowp+bao and planck tt , te , ee+lowp+bao dataset combinations , respectively . in the power - law pps scenario",
    "the strongest bounds are @xmath175 ev at 95% cl and @xmath176 ev at 95% cl , obtained for the planck tt , te , ee+lowp+bao dataset .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that degeneracies among the parameters involved in the @xmath0model ( and its possible extensions ) and the pps shape arise when considering cmb temperature power spectrum measurements only .",
    "fortunately , these degeneracies disappear with the inclusion of high-@xmath54 polarization data .",
    "this is due to the fact that all these cosmological parameters influence the tt , te and ee spectra in different ways .",
    "this confirms the robustness of both the @xmath0  model and the simplest inflationary models , that predict a power - law pps that successfully explains the observations at small scales .",
    "the large scale fluctuations of the cmb spectrum , however , seem to point towards something new in the scenarios that describe inflation .",
    "it must be clarified whether these features are indicating a more complicated inflationary mechanism or are instead statistical fluctuations of the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "furthermore , we have as well verified that current data , albeit showing a very mild preference for the power - law scenario , is far from robustly discarding the ` pchip`parameterization , and , therefore , future cosmological measurements are mandatory to sharpen the pps profile .",
