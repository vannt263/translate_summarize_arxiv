    "a classical topic in finance and actuarial science is that of optimal dividend distribution for a company , which can be phrased as the management s problem of determining the optimal timing and sizes of dividend payments in the presence of bankruptcy risk , where the usual objective is the expected value of the cumulative discounted dividend payments until bankruptcy . the earliest work in this setting can be traced back to de finetti @xcite who studied the dividend problem for an insurance company under the binomial model . in continuous time",
    "the problem was posed and solved in a brownian motion model for the cash reserves by jeanblanc - piqu & shiryaev @xcite , radner & shepp @xcite and asmussen & taksar @xcite , using optimal control theory . since then",
    "an extensive literature has appeared on the dividend problem and its extensions , including reinsurance ( e.g. @xcite ) , optimal investment of the reserves ( e.g. @xcite ) , tax and proportional cost ( e.g. @xcite ) , and growth options ( @xcite ) .    in general , the form of the optimal dividend policy has been found to depend on the expected growth rate and variability of future revenues , and the discount rate . due to changing market and economic conditions these quantities are not constant but will evolve in time . since hamilton @xcite , a substantial econometric literature has appeared that supports the use of markov regime - switching models to describe business cycles , term structure of interest rates and other macroeconomic quantities .",
    "such models have been shown to be capable of capturing occasional simultaneous and sizeable changes of the parameters .",
    "regime - switching models in addition have the advantage of retaining a degree of analytical tractability , and models from this class can in principle approximate a given diffusion arbitrarily closely by taking the state space large enough and specifying the generator matrix appropriately .",
    "also in the mathematical finance literature regime - switching models have become more popular , and have found their applications in stock price models , interest rate models and the real option literature .",
    "see e.g. boyarchenko and levendorski @xcite , buffington and elliott @xcite , driffill et al .",
    "@xcite , duan et al .",
    "@xcite , elliott et al .",
    "@xcite , guo and zhang @xcite , jiang and pistorius @xcite , naik @xcite for derivative pricing , elliott and van der hoek @xcite and guidolin and timmermann @xcite for asset allocation , buerle @xcite , li and lu @xcite , zhu and yang @xcite and asmussen @xcite for ruin and risk theory , and guo et al .",
    "@xcite for irreversible investment .    in a regime - switching setting ,",
    "modelling the company s cumulative net revenues as a drifted brownian motion , with its volatility and drift modulated by a finite state markov chain , and the discount rate as a deterministic function of the chain , we will solve the optimal dividend problem , under the assumption that the company is bankrupt once its reserves hit zero .",
    "we will show that the form of the optimal dividend policy depends on the sign of the drift : in the case that the expected net revenues ( the drift ) are positive in every regime , it is optimal to adopt a barrier - type strategy at certain positive levels that depend on the current regime , that is , it is optimal to make the minimal payments needed to keep the cash reserves below these barrier levels .",
    "when a regime - switch occurs , the barrier jumps up or down , and dividend payments are to be postponed or advanced accordingly .",
    "when there is only a single regime , this strategy reduces to the classical constant barrier strategy found before by asmussen & taksar @xcite and radner & shepp @xcite . in the case",
    "that in at least one regime the drift is negative the optimal strategy takes a different form .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that , if the drift is negative and the reserves are sufficiently small , it will be optimal to liquidate the company by paying out the reserves as a lump - sum . in the absence of regime - switching , this optimality actually holds irrespective of the size of the reserves . in the presence of regime - switching , however , we find that it is optimal to continue the business if the drift is small and negative and the reserves are not too small : the prospect of switching to a regime with positive drift then outweighs the risk of ruin . in this case",
    "the value function is not concave , which is different from what is usually found in singular control problems .",
    "an explicit solution is derived in section [ sec : casetwo ] in the case of two regimes .",
    "the dividend optimization problem gives rise to a singular control problem , whose hjb equation takes the form of a coupled system of variational inequalities , due to the fact that the problem is driven by a two - dimensional markov process . a commonly used direct approach for explicitly solving optimal control problems proceeds by guessing a candidate optimal solution , constructing a corresponding value - function , a priori assuming the necessary smoothness , and subsequently establishing its optimality by employing a verification result .",
    "here we shall follow a somewhat different approach , by directly employing the dynamic programming equation .",
    "we will prove that the value function is the fixed point of a certain contraction operator , which is given explicitly in terms of the initial data , and derive an explicit iterative algorithm to calculate the value function , which ` decouples ' the different regimes such that at any stage one - dimensional control problems are solved .",
    "this construction yields a posteriori that the value function is @xmath0 , which implies that the value function is a classical solution of the hjb equation . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that , although it is in principle also possible to follow the mentioned direct approach , this seems to become intractable when the number of regimes is large , since it leads to a ( large ) collection of systems of coupled non - linear equations corresponding to different orderings of the dividend levels .",
    "after the first version of this paper was written , we discovered a related work on optimal dividend problems by sotomayor and cadenillas @xcite . in a setting that is a particular case of ours , with two regimes and constant rate of discounting ,",
    "they solve three dividend distribution problems with bounded and unbounded dividend rates , and in the presence of fixed cost , respectively , under the assumption of existence of a solution to the smooth fit equations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : prel ] we give a statement of the problem , and present a dynamic programming equation and verification theorem . in sections [ sec : opt ] and [ sec : alg ] we present the optimal solution and give a proof by constructing an iterative algorithm to calculate the value function @xmath1 . finally , section [ sec : casetwo ] is devoted to a case study of the setting of two regimes , with a numerical illustration of the sensitivities of the optimal barrier levels to the different parameters .",
    "some proofs have been relegated to the appendix .",

    "assume that the cash reserves @xmath7 evolve , in the absence of dividend payments , as a regime - switching linear brownian motion , that is , @xmath8 satisfies the sde @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the state of economy . for every state @xmath11 in @xmath4 ,",
    "both drift parameter @xmath12 and volatility parameter @xmath13 are assumed to be known constants . in case there is no notational confusion possible , we will write @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . the processes @xmath8 and @xmath10 are defined on some filtered probability space @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the right - continuous completed filtration jointly generated by @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",

    "we will assume that , apart from reducing the reserves , dividend payments have no effect on the business and that there are no transaction cost associated to the payment or receipt of dividends .",
    "the dynamics of the risk reserve process @xmath32 in the presence of dividend payments are then given by @xmath33 for all @xmath31 until the time @xmath34 of bankruptcy and @xmath35 for @xmath31 after @xmath34 , where @xmath36 is the first time that @xmath37 hits zero .",
    "to avoid degeneracies only those dividend strategies will be considered that have no lump sum dividend payments larger than the current level of the reserves : a dividend strategy @xmath27 is called _ admissible _ if @xmath27 is @xmath38-adapted , @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 denoting by @xmath42 the set of admissible dividend strategies , the objective - function of the shareholders is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the expected value of the discounted dividends until the time of ruin @xmath34 under the dividend strategy @xmath27 , @xmath45,\\ ] ] with @xmath46 the markov - modulated rate of discounting .",
    "the problem for the shareholders is to identify a dividend strategy @xmath47 that attains the supremum in , that is , @xmath48 .",
    "assume for the moment that there is only a single regime , @xmath49 .",
    "then we are back in the classical brownian setting that was investigated by asmussen & taksar @xcite and radner & shepp @xcite .",
    "they showed that , if @xmath50 , the optimal strategy is a constant barrier strategy at the level @xmath51 according to this strategy , the overflow of the reserves above the level @xmath52 is immediately paid out as dividends .",

    "the non - linear equations were solved using a maple routine based on the standard quasi - newton method .",
    "we chose the parameters as in table [ table2 ] and varied @xmath301 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath304 individually whilst keeping the other parameters fixed the results are given in table [ table6 ] .",
    "we see that when the drift parameter @xmath301 is increased then initially @xmath305 and @xmath306 increase , while they decrease when the drift @xmath301 becomes very large .",
    "apparently , for relatively low drift it is optimal to reduce the probability of ruin while for large drift the effect of discounting takes priority .",
    "table [ table6 ] also shows that the two barriers @xmath305 and @xmath306 monotonically increase when @xmath302 increases .",
    "a larger volatility leads to a higher probability of ruin requiring the company to raise the level of the barrier in order to protect its future operations .",
    "we can also observe the effect of the transition rates of the underlying markov chain .",
    "for example , if the rate is @xmath307 , the chain spends a large part of the time in state 0 ( in equilibrium , @xmath308 of the time ) , which we find back as @xmath309 is very close to @xmath310 , whereas if @xmath311 and @xmath312 are of similar size , the chain spends on average similar amounts of time in both states and the level @xmath305 differs substantially from @xmath313 .",
    "finally , we note that both @xmath305 and @xmath306 decrease when the rate of discounting @xmath304 is increased : if the rate of discounting is higher it is optimal to increase the dividend payments by lowering the dividend barriers .",
    "we next consider the case that the drift is positive in one state and negative in the other .",
    "intuitively it is clear that for sufficiently small reserves a quick bankruptcy of the company is highly likely if the drift is negative , so that it is optimal to liquidate the company .",
    "if , however , the negative drift is moderate and the reserves are not too small , the expected future gains from a regime switch to a ` good ' state may outweigh the effect of the negative drift and it may be optimal to continue the business . in that case",
    "a sensible strategy could be to liquidate the company for small initial reserves but pay out dividends according to a modulated barrier strategy for larger levels of reserves , which we formalize as follows :    a _ modulated liquidation and dividend barrier strategy _ at levels @xmath314 and @xmath114 is a dividend strategy @xmath315 satisfying @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the insurance risk process corresponding to @xmath318 .    condition ( iii ) states that all the reserves are paid out as dividends once the risk reserves fall below the level @xmath319 .",

    "if @xmath327 and @xmath328 ( the case @xmath329 follows by relabelling the states ) , it turns out that it is optimal to continue paying dividends if the reserves are large enough , where the ` liquidation ' level @xmath330 solves the smooth fit equation @xmath331 .",
