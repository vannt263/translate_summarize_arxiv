    "recently spin ladders@xcite have attracted considerable interest due to increasing experimental realizations of ladder - structure compounds , such as srcu@xmath5o@xmath10@xcite , cu@xmath5(c@xmath7h@xmath8n@xmath5)@xmath5cl@xmath9 , ( 5iap)@xmath5cubr@xmath62h@xmath5o@xcite , ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9@xcite , etc .. among the most interesting problems related to spin ladders are the existence of a gap , field - induced quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) and relevant magnetic properties .",
    "as it has been observed experimentally , strongly - coupled spin ladders are gapped and the magnetic field @xmath11 induces two qpt s with two critical fields .",
    "the first critical field @xmath12 closes the gap and the second one @xmath13 fully polarizes all the spins . in terms of the weak leg ( @xmath2 ) and strong rung ( @xmath3 )",
    "interactions , the leading terms of the critical fields are @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite , which coincide with the experiments .",
    "many spin ladder compounds can be described by the standard heisenberg spin ladder ( hsl ) , though some other compounds possess spin frustration and contain diagonal leg interactions . theoretically , properties in a magnetic field have been discussed by numerical methods such as exact diagonalization@xcite , transfer - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) technique@xcite , quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite , as well as other methods for strong - coupling limit like perturbation expansions@xcite , bosonization@xcite and mapping into xxz heisenberg chain@xcite .",
    "recently some effort was exerted in bridging the integrable spin ladder ( isl ) to real spin ladder compounds by introducing a rescaling parameter @xmath14 in the leg interaction@xcite , the high - temperature expansion ( hte)@xcite was developed for the isotropic isl@xcite and also extended to the anisotropic isl with an xyz rung interaction@xcite . for a real spin ladder material , it is favorable to form rung states , since it is unfavorable for the weak leg interaction to take apart the strongly - coupled rung states .",
    "it happens that the isl is based on the permutation of the formed rung states without breaking them .",
    "therefore , if the system parameters are properly chosen , the isl can provide some reasonable information , while from the isl the analysis , for its characteristic features such as the ground state ( gs ) , excitations and the gap , the qpt s , the magnetization inflection point ( ip ) and thermodynamical properties in finite temperatures , is quite convenient .",
    "the rescaling parameter @xmath14 introduced in the isl yields a gap @xmath15 and the two critical fields @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "as far as the leading terms are concerned , the value @xmath18 for strong coupling fits the gap ( and consequently @xmath19 of the hsl@xcite , but the second critical field @xmath20 does not agree with the experiment - coinciding result @xmath21@xcite .",
    "another point is that the magnetization symmetric inflection point ( ip ) @xmath22 takes the value @xmath23 for all choices of @xmath14 , the deviation from the experimental result @xmath24 will become more considerable , when the leg interaction gets stronger .",
    "a more appropriate way based on more physical origin for deciding the system parameters is lacking and expected to lay a closer bridge of the isl to the real spin ladder compounds .    in the present paper , we shall consider an isl where the system parameters are determined by the vanishing of the expectation value of the different interactions of the isl relative to the hsl , for the gs in the gapped phase and the fully - polarized phase .",
    "we find that such an isl analytically has the correct leading terms of the critical fields both at the first and the second qpt s : @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "the magnetization ip is located at @xmath4 .",
    "our result of the magnetizations for the gs and at finite temperatures compare well both with numerical computation from the tmrg as well as the finite - spin exact diagonalization and with the experimental data for the compounds ( 5iap)@xmath5cubr@xmath252h@xmath5o , cu@xmath5(c@xmath7h@xmath8n@xmath5)@xmath5cl@xmath9 and ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility coincides with the experimental data , and comparison with perturbation theory for strong coupling shows a good agreement .",
    "many spin ladder compounds are described by the hsl with the hamiltonian @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are spin-1/2 operators for the two legs , the three parts @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the leg interaction , rung interaction and the zeeman energy , respectively . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the leg and rung coupling strengths .",
    "there are totally @xmath33 rungs and @xmath11 is the external magnetic field .    before considering for all values of the magnetic field , we shall first take a simple look at the fully - polarized phase and show that the hsl is equivalent to an isl for @xmath26 .",
    "for convenience we label the rung singlet as @xmath34 /@xmath35 and the rung triplet as @xmath36 , @xmath37 /@xmath35 , @xmath38 where the subscript @xmath39 denotes the @xmath39th rung .",
    "the rung interaction leads to an energy @xmath40 for the singlet and @xmath41 for the triplet .",
    "after @xmath13 all spin are polarized so the ground state is @xmath42 for a ladder with total @xmath33 rungs@xmath43 which is exactly the eigenstate of the hsl @xmath44 .",
    "when the field is lowered down to the critical point @xmath13 from the fully - polarized phase , spins begin to flip down .",
    "more elementally the spin flips are linear combinations of the strongly - coupled rung states .",
    "less excitations lead to lower energy , so one the - most - favorable state will enter the gs first , which indicates the occurrence of the qpt .",
    "since the rung state @xmath45 has higher energy in the presence of the field , we only need to consider @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the critical point .",
    "the lowest excitation can be trapped out from a subspace where there are at most one @xmath48 and @xmath49 , all possible neighbors collected are \\{@xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56)}. for all these neighbors we exactly have an equivalent relation @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the permutation operator . @xmath59 exchanges the rung states @xmath60 : @xmath61 .",
    "consequently the hamiltonian in this subspace can be rewritten as @xmath62 which is actually an isl@xcite .",
    "as there is at most one @xmath48 and one @xmath49 , the exact eigenenergy from the bethe ansatz approach@xcite is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fully - polarized eigenenergy , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( taking the value @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) are the numbers of states @xmath46 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "apparently both @xmath46 and @xmath49 are gapful if @xmath69 , and the gs is fully - polarized .",
    "the value @xmath70 corresponds to the critical field @xmath71 , which reaches the same result deduced from the instability of spin wave spectrum in the ferromagnetic phase and that obtained from mapping onto an xxz heisenberg chain @xcite .",
    "the expression of the saturation point is exact , more exactly speaking , for an even number of rungs .",
    "the one - particle bethe ansatz wavefunction corresponding to @xmath70 provides @xmath72 where @xmath73 according to favorable energy . for antiferromagnetic spin ladder with positive @xmath3 and @xmath2 , @xmath47 has higher excitation energy , then @xmath74 is the singlet @xmath46 and @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76 will be used in our further discussion . for an odd number of periodic rungs , the term @xmath77 in the critical expression",
    "is replaced by @xmath78\\right ) j_{\\parallel } $ ] , as @xmath70 is not the solution in periodic boundary conditions . but this size effect will completely disappear in thermodynamical limit .",
    "after the simple look at the fully - polarized phase in the previous section , we proceed to discuss all values of the field applied on an antiferromagnetic spin ladder .",
    "the relation @xmath79 from ( [ heqp ] ) does not hold for neighbors @xmath80 , @xmath81 or @xmath82 , though it is exact for all the other kinds of neighbor states . to find a model effective for all value of fields",
    ", we shall consider such an isl with the difference in @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 the rung interaction part @xmath31 and zeeman term @xmath32 are exactly the same as the hsl @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath86 , the @xmath87 will reduce to the leg interaction of the hsl .",
    "the extra part @xmath88 makes the model integrable , but the biquadratic exchange @xmath89@xcite in @xmath59 does not appear in the hsl , though it is as weak as the leg interaction .",
    "we set and balance the parameters @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 to reduce its influence . to minimize its extra effect",
    ", we consider in such a way that it vanishes in expectation @xmath93 as much as possible in the gs .",
    "our consideration aims to make the model exactly soluble on one hand , while on the other hand , the extra effect is minimized as much as possible .",
    "more complicated balance terms such as @xmath94 , @xmath95 can be taken into account in @xmath88 but they break the isotropy . here",
    "we consider the simplest case ( [ hextra ] ) which preserves the isotropy when it is giving quite good results . to see the integrability ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath96 where @xmath59 forms the permutation operator in the su(4 ) integrable model@xcite and @xmath32 is the zeeman term as in the hsl .",
    "the model ( [ isl2 ] ) essentially is an isl@xcite which can be exactly solved by bethe ansatz approach@xcite .",
    "the exact eigenenergy reads @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the single - rung energy of the singlet ( @xmath99 ) and triplet ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , @xmath103 is the total rung number in the corresponding rung states .",
    "the rung state with lowest @xmath98 is chosen as the reference state , @xmath104 is the total number of rungs occupied by the other rung states .",
    "the singlet is chosen as the reference state before the ip @xmath105 ( decided by @xmath106 ) , while @xmath107 is the reference state thereafter .",
    "the gapped phase lies in the former case and the fully - polarized phase locates in the latter .    the gapped phase of the isl is composed of the singlet .",
    "the magnetic field lowers the energy of the triplet component @xmath107 which enters the gs when the gap is closed at the first qpt .",
    "further increase of the field brings all the components of the singlet out of the gs and another gap opens at the second qpt ( we refer the gapped phase to be at @xmath108 , though the fully - polarized phase is also gapped ) . since both the gapped phase and the fully - polarized phase only consist of one rung state ( @xmath48 or @xmath107 , respectively ) , which is chosen as the reference state , @xmath104 in these two phases corresponds to the number of the excitations to the other three components .",
    "then from the eigenenergy ( [ e - ba ] ) , it is very easy to find the excitation gap and the two critical fields @xmath109 which , respectively , closes the gap of the gapped phase and open the gap of the fully - polarized phase .",
    "the @xmath110 terms come from the lowest energy in the excitation band , @xmath111 corresponds to the bottom of the energy band .",
    "the critical fields as well as the ip realize the relation @xmath112 , which is the magnetization symmetric point and agrees with the experiments , as discussed in the following .",
    "experimentally strongly - coupled spin ladder compounds have two similar qpt s , separating the application of the external magnetic field into three phases . as usually described by the hsl ,",
    "the fully - polarized state @xmath113 exactly is the system gs after the second phase transition , while the singlet is the most favorable state and dominates overwhelmingly in the gapped phase before the occurrence of the first qpt for the antiferromagnetically strongly - coupled real spin ladder compounds .    among the total three phases , the extra - interaction effect of the isl",
    "can be minimized explicitly in two phases , gapped phase and the fully - polarized phase . fulfilling the relation ( [ heq0 ] ) in these",
    "two phase gives rise to @xmath114 where the term @xmath115 in the former equation comes from the expectation of the hsl leg interaction , while in the latter equation this expectation vanishes in the singlet phase .",
    "the solution is direct to obtain and we yield to the limitations @xmath116 under these parameters , the gs has the exact equivalence @xmath117 for the fully - polarized phase @xmath118 and the expectation equivalence @xmath119 for the gapped singlet phase @xmath108 . then the ip is determined from the definite @xmath91 in ( [ parameters ] ) @xmath120 which , as it turns out in the following comparisons , produces well the experimental value and tmrg numerical result .",
    "note here that this experiment - coinciding ip expression is an analytic result from our consideration , and instead of from empirical parameter choosing , the presence of the term @xmath121 comes from the only requirement on the extra - interaction - effect minimizing ( [ heq0 ] ) of the above two phases .",
    "we shall decide more definitely the parameter @xmath14 by considering the critical points of the qpt s .",
    "since the exact analysis for the hsl is available at the second qpt as discussed in the previous section , we first consider such a case that the extra interactions of the isl also vanish at the second critical point , in addition to the requirement on the gapped phase and fully - polarized phase .",
    "although @xmath88 does not vanish for a single neighbor - site pairs @xmath122 at @xmath13 , the action of these extra terms together can cancel each other .",
    "in fact , noticing the relation ( [ heqp ] ) for the rung - state neighbors @xmath123 and @xmath122 involved at the second critical point , one can easily obtain @xmath124\\psi _",
    "{ c2}.\\ ] ] setting the extra - interaction effect to vanish @xmath125 , in addition to the limitations ( [ parameters ] ) from the afore - discussed two phases , leads us to the definite parameters @xmath126 thus the relation ( [ heqp ] ) is replaced by @xmath127for fully - polarized phase @xmath118 and @xmath128 at the critical point @xmath129 .",
    "such a simple consideration immediately gives the two critical fields @xmath130 as it is expected , @xmath13 is the same exact result as we discuss in the previous section .",
    "note that here @xmath12 for the first qpt is actually composed of the leading terms from the perturbation theory and has been often used in experiments , while we have not imposed any limitation on the first qpt and it is a by - product of the consideration of the second qpt .",
    "the magnetization can be obtained by thermodynamical bethe ansatz ( tba ) which is also very convenient for analysis of the field - induced qpts@xcite . for the isl under consideration ,",
    "the magnetization between the two critical fields in zero - temperature is decided by the following tba equations of the dressed energy and density , @xmath131 where @xmath132/j_{\\parallel } $ ] for @xmath133 , @xmath134/(2\\pi ) $ ] , and the symbol @xmath135 denotes the convolution .",
    "the fermi sea with negative dressed energy @xmath136 forms the system gs . here the gs only involves one branch of dressed energy , since the gs of the isl is composed of the singlet in the absence of the field , while only the component @xmath137 is lowered in energy level and brought down to the gs by the applied field .",
    "correspondingly the gap of the excitation to the component @xmath47 and @xmath45 never closes during the gapless competition between @xmath46 and @xmath138 in the gs .",
    "we present an example of the gs magnetization in fig.[comphayward ] .",
    "the symbols are data figured out from ref . in the study by lanczos",
    "exact diagonalization on 2@xmath13912 and 2@xmath13916 hsl with periodic boundary conditions , the ratio of the leg and rung interaction strength is @xmath140 .",
    "the solid curve is our result which coincides with the finite - site exact diagonalization .",
    "there is some small discrepancy at the first qpt due to existence of higher - order terms in @xmath12 ( the discrepancy will be reduced when the higher - order terms are picked up , as one will see from gs magnetization compared with t=0.02 tmrg result in fig.[yulumz ] and fig.[hc12tmrg ] ) .",
    "as our consideration provides the same @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the hsl in leading terms , the coincidence of our result with the experiments is also expected .",
    "two examples are given in fig.[mzgsexp]a and b , respectively for the compound cu@xmath5(c@xmath7h@xmath8n@xmath5)@xmath5cl@xmath9@xcite with ratio @xmath141 and ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9@xcite with @xmath142 .    the high - temperature expansion ( hte)@xcite has been developed for the isotropic isl@xcite .",
    "then the temperature - dependent free energy per spin takes the form @xmath143 where the expansion is carried out for per rung and the factor @xmath115 is added for per spin , @xmath144 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we present some orders of coefficients , @xmath145 where @xmath146 @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "one can get higher orders for lower temperatures .",
    "we compare our result of ( [ c=0 ] ) with the compound ( 5iap)@xmath5cubr@xmath62h@xmath5o , with ratio @xmath150 , the magnetizations @xmath151 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath152 are presented in fig.[landeemz ] and fig.[landeesus ] , respectively .",
    "the comparison shows a good agreement with the experiments .",
    "the unit of the susceptibility in comparing the experiment is determined by the curie constant @xmath153 , which can be clearly seen when we expand the susceptibility in ( [ susn ] ) .",
    "the curie constant is decided , usually for molar susceptibility , when the @xmath154 factor is measured by the experiment . for the compound cu@xmath5(c@xmath7h@xmath8n@xmath5)@xmath5cl@xmath9@xcite ,",
    "we have shown in fig.[mzgsexp]b the coincidence of our gs magnetization with the experimental magnetization of the lowest available temperature .",
    "this compound possesses nonlinear torque magnetization@xcite and possible weak diagonal interaction , which may be the possible reason that causes the observed asymmetric magnetizations at different higher temperatures .",
    "so here we shall not compare the magnetizations for this compound at higher temperatures .",
    "the compound ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9@xcite has stronger leg interaction ( @xmath155 ) , the higher - order terms of the gap become more considerable .",
    "the small difference resulted from the high order terms can be seen from fig.[mzgsexp]b , the dotted line and the solid one are the magnetizations in the absence and presence of the high - order terms , respectively . in the following we shall pick up the high - order terms .      up to now our consideration has exhibited the correct leading terms of the critical fields . when the leg interaction is stronger , the higher - order terms in the gap ( equal to @xmath156 ) become more considerable . on the other hand ,",
    "the fluctuation @xmath157 in the singlet phase is very large , treatment of the first qpt may influence the system properties more sensitively than the second qpt .",
    "unlike in the second qpt , the exact solution of the hsl is not available in the first qpt , requiring @xmath158 is not explicitly executable .",
    "so we directly adjust the parameters to fit the gap , which is also a result of @xmath159 .",
    "the higher orders terms in the gap of the hsl converge slowly in the perturbation theory , but it was found@xcite that a two - parameter gap @xmath160 fits the numerical data of greven _",
    "et al_.@xcite very well @xmath161 where @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "the @xmath164 comes from the high - order terms in the gap and here we have used a label @xmath165 for our convenience . setting @xmath166 will give rise to this gap at the same time when the requirement in ( [ parameters ] ) of the isl is fulfilled .",
    "in fig.[yulumz ] we compare the magnetizations with the tmrg numerical result@xcite in various temperatures , for @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "the solid lines are plotted according to the corresponding temperatures of the tmrg data , the broken line is plotted at t@xmath169 compared with the lowest temperature t=0.02 tmrg result .",
    "as one can see , the agreement is quite good for all the temperatures . for the comparison with the experiment , fig.[watsonmzsus ] presents the magnetizations for the spin ladder compound ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9@xcite with a stronger leg interaction ( @xmath170 , @xmath171 ) .",
    "as the hte is not valid for 0.7k , we also calculate the magnetization of gs ( 0.0k ) by tba , a more clear comparison has been presented in [ mzgsexp]b .",
    "the figure demonstrates a good agreement of our result with the experiment .",
    "the susceptibility in a low field is given in the inset , our result in the solid line coincides with the experimental observation except for some small deviation at the hump .",
    "the interesting ip is an invariant point of the magnetizations at low temperatures .",
    "the compound ( 5iap)@xmath5cubr@xmath62h@xmath5o@xcite in fig.[landeemz ] indicates the ip , though it suffers from the impurities . as the compound ( c@xmath7h@xmath8n)@xmath5cubr@xmath9 is free of the impurity or diagonal interaction",
    ", it exhibits an unambiguous ip at the half - saturation .",
    "the tmrg numerical calculation for the theoretically ideal hsl also shows the ip . from the isl ,",
    "it is direct to understand the ip .",
    "two reasons are both necessary for the ip : ( i ) equal energy of the only two components competing in the gs ; ( ii ) large excitation gap relative to the temperatures",
    ". actually only two components , the singlet @xmath46 and the triplet component @xmath138 , compete in the gs , as we mentioned below the dressed energy equation .",
    "the ip locates at the point where the reference state in an increasing field converts from @xmath46 to @xmath138 . at this point",
    "the two components have the same rung energy @xmath106 and same proportion @xmath172 in the gs .",
    "the excitations to the other components @xmath49 to @xmath45 are gapful , the gap are exactly available@xcite @xmath173 which is large due to the strong rung coupling @xmath3 .",
    "low temperatures can hardly stimulate excitations to @xmath49 or @xmath45 , while each of @xmath46 and @xmath138 with the same energy still occupies half the total rungs . as a result , the ip is invariant with a half - saturation magnetization under low temperatures .",
    "higher temperatures will excite @xmath49 as well as @xmath45 and lower the magnetization , consequently the magnetization curves do not go through the ip , as one can see partly from the temperature t=2.5 and more clearly from t= 5.0 , 10 in fig.[yulumz ] .",
    "the location of the ip is well produced by our analytic expression ( [ ip ] ) for the compound and the tmrg data .",

    "will be @xmath184 , which does not vanish though it is small .",
    "nevertheless , this can be also resolved by more consideration .",
    "previously we only take the dominant singlet component into account in the gapped phase of the hsl , as a simple physical picture as in the isl .",
    "when the hsl - type leg interaction becomes less weak , small amount of other components will be mixed into the gapped singlet phase of the strong coupling limit .",
    "therefore the average per - leg expectation value of the hsl leg interaction does not vanish as in a pure singlet phase .",

    "@xmath185 is null in our previous simpler consideration that singlet component dominates overwhelmingly in the strongly - coupled hsl . combining ( [ mixed ] ) in the gapped phase , the gap fitting @xmath187 and the extra - interaction minimizing ( [ fpeqv ] ) in the fully - polarized phase , one gets @xmath188 if setting @xmath189 , one will regain the vanishing of the extra - interaction @xmath125 for the second critical field . in such case",
