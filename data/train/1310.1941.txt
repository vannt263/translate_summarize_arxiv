    "it describes an essential part of cell  to  cell communication in the brain .",
    "this model was in various ways extended to also describe when the brain s normal performance fails , such as in migraine hallucinations and acute stroke . however , the fundamental mechanism of these extensions remained poorly understood .",
    "we study the structure of biophysical neuron models that starve from their ` free ' energy , that is , the energy that can directly be converted to do work .",
    "although neurons still have access to chemical energy , which needs to be converted by the metabolism to obtain free energy , their free energy  starvation can be more stable than expected , explaining pathological conditions in migraine and stroke .",
    "the hodgkin  huxley ( hh ) model is one of the most successful models in mathematical biology@xcite .",
    "this formalism , i.e. , a hh  type model , describes voltage changes across cell membranes that result in excitability .",
    "not only neurons are excitable cells , also myocytes , pancreatic @xmath1cells , and even a plant cell ( chara corallina ) exhibit excitable dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dynamic range of phenomena includes single action potentials ( spikes ) , periodic spiking , and bursting ( slow modulation of spiking ) .",
    "for example , in pancreatic @xmath1cells bursting is induced by a calcium current @xcite .",
    "a more complete treatment of this phenomenon , however , also requires the inclusion of na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of ion pumps and ion concentrations is also crucial for cardiac alternans ( periodic beat  to  beat variations ) and higher  order rhythms in the ischemic ventricular muscle @xcite .    in the literature such augmented hh ",
    "type models are also called second  generation hh models@xcite . in the context of certain pathologies of the brain , whose fundamental dynamic structure we study here ,",
    "we prefer the simpler name ` ion  based ' models .",
    "this indicates that ion concentrations are major dynamical , that is , time ",
    "dependent variables .",
    "their dynamical role in neuron models goes beyond merely modulating spiking activity .",
    "ion dynamics can lead to a completely new type of _ ionic excitability _ and bistability , that is , the phenomena of so  called ` spreading depolarizations ' and ` anoxic depolarization ' , respectively .",
    "( spreading depolarizations are also called spreading depression and we will use both names interchangeably in this paper . ) these depolarized states of neurons are related to migraine , stroke , brain injury , and brain death , that is , to pathologies of the brain in which a transient or permanent break  down of the transmembrane potential occurs @xcite .",
    "another even more characteristic property of this ` twilight state close to death ' @xcite are the nearly completely flat transmembrane ion gradients .",
    "the almost complete break  down of both membrane potential and  due to reduced ion gradients  nernst potentials together cause a nearly complete release of the gibbs free energy , that is , the thermodynamic potential that measures the energy available to the neurons for normal functioning .",
    "we hence refer to this state as a state of free energy  starvation ( fes ) .",
    "we want to stress that such phenomena require the broader thermodynamical perspective , because it goes beyond the hh description in terms equivalent electrical circuits in membrane physiology ( see discussion ) .",
    "the object of this study is to clarify quantitatively the detailed ion  based mechanisms , in particular the time ",
    "dependent potentials , leading to this condition .",
    "in fact , early ion  based models have been introduced in a different context to describe excitable myocytes and pancreatic @xmath1cells with variable ion concentrations @xcite .",
    "neuronal ion  based models have been used to study spreading depolarizations ( sd ) @xcite and anoxic depolarizations @xcite . in these phenomenological studies",
    "the types of ion dynamics related to the pathologies have been reproduced , but not investigated in a bifurcation analysis .",
    "hence the fundamental phase space structure of these high  dimensional models that underlies the ionic excitability characterisitic of sd remains poorly understood .",
    "furthermore , neuronal ion  based models have been used to study seizure activity @xcite and spontaneous spiking patterns in myelinated axons with injury  like membrane damaging conditions ( e.g. , caused by concussions ) @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the phase space structure was investigated , however , only with respect to the modulating effect of ion concentrations on the fast spiking dynamics ( seizure activity , injuries ) , and with respect to spiking node  to  node transmission fidelity ( myelinated axons ) .    in this paper",
    "we present bifurcation analyses of several minimal biophysical ion  based models that reveal bistability of extremely different ion configurations",
    " physiological conditions vs.  free energy  starvation  for a large range of pump rates . in related models",
    "certain bistabilities have been explored before .",
    "for example , frhlich et al.@xcite found coexistence of quiescence and bursting for certain fixed extracellular potassium concentrations and also bistability of a physiological and a strongly depolarized membrane state in a slow  fast analysis of calcium gated channels .",
    "bistability of similar fixed points has also been found for the variation of extracellular potassium@xcite or , similarly , the potassium nernst potential@xcite .",
    "also the effect of pump strength variation has been explored under fixed fes conditions@xcite . in this paper , however , we do not treat slow variables as parameters and show bistability of fast dynamics , but instead we address the stability of ion concentrations themselves , which are subject to extremely slow dynamics .",
    "this allows us to find bistability of extremely different ion distributions , a feature that distinguishes these two states from the polarized and depolarized states studied in the afore mentioned work .",
    "a study that also had significantly different ion distributions was done by cressman et al@xcite , however , the seizure - like phenomena discussed in their work are quite different  though clinically related  from those presented in this paper .    because of the occurrence of ion state bistability we conjecture that our model describes a threshold reduction of a mechanism that leads to ionic excitability in form of spreading depolarizations . in other words , we conclude that an important inhibitory mechanism to describe ion homeostasis such as glial buffering or diffusive regulation of extracellular ion concentrations plays a crucial role in ion homeostasis and the na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps alone are insufficient to recover from free energy  starved states .",
    "we show that when the extracellular k@xmath0 concentration is regulated by linearly coupling it to an infinite bath , the bistable system changes to an excitable system , which we call ionic excitability . the effect of turning off glial buffering and diffusion has been discussed in more detailed ion  based models@xcite before , but has not been related to the fundamental phase space structure of the system .",
    "our conclusions have been validated by demonstrating the robustness of the results in a large variety of minimal ion  based models , which all consistently show this insufficiency of na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps , and also in a very detailed mebrane model that has been used intensively for computational studies of spreading depolarizations and seizure  like activity@xcite .",
    "a simple ion  based neuron model can be obtained as a natural extension of the hodgkin ",
    "huxley ( hh ) model @xcite .",
    "we list the basic equations of hh that we used for the sake of completeness , and also comment on two often used model reductions of which one must be modified for our study . furthermore leak currents are specified , which is necessary for the extension towards ion  based modeling .    in the hh model ,",
    "single neuron dynamics is described in terms of an electrically active membrane carrying an electric potential @xmath2 , and the three gating variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that render the system excitable .",

    ", however , the main task of the ion pumps under physiological conditions is to compensate for sodium and potassium leak currents ( see next section ) while gated currents are extremely small in the equilibrium .",

    "model ) it is obvious that the chloride leak current stabilizes the equilibrium membrane potential . to test its stabilizing effect in the context of ion  based modeling we compare models that either do or do not contain this current .",
    "we are further interested in the question whether membrane excitability and ion bistability are related .",
    "therefore also the effect of in and excluding active ion channels is tested .    in this section",
    "we will only discuss fixed points and their stability , but not the unstable limit cycles belonging to hbs . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the fixed point continuation curves for all combinations of current model ( nernst or ghk ) , pump choice ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) and the respective in and exclusion of chloride and active ion channels channel are shown .",
    "each panel ( a)(d ) contains all continuation curves for a given choice of pump and current model . for those models that are bistable for certain pump rates an overview of the different dynamical regimes",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "it shows the parameter ranges for bistability and for monostability of a physiological state or fes .",
    "the most striking result of this bifurcation analysis is that this bistability occurs in all models with gated ion channels , but not in any model with only leak channels ( grey  shaded graphs in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the comparison of any model with active gates and its leak  only counterpart shows that whenever the physiological equilibrium of the first one exists it is identical to the equilibrium of the latter one .",
    "while the physiological state disappears in a lp for all bistable models at small pumping , the fixed points of the leak models remain stable , but depolarize drastically for further decreasing pump rates until the donnan equilibrium for @xmath43 is reached . the absence of the second fixed point in leak  only models is plausible if we consider fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] again .",
    "the depolarized state is characterized by large ion concentrations @xmath44 and @xmath45 which implies an increased pump current ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) ) .",
    "since the differences between the nernst potentials and the membrane potential are even smaller in the depolarized state , higher , hence gated , conductances are required to compensate for the pump currents and maintain the depolarized state .",
    "besides the requirement of active ion channels , the bistability is a very robust feature of these simple ion  based models .",
    "let us now consider the effect of the different model features on the minimal physiological pump rate , i.e. , the pump rate required for a stable physiological fixed point , and the recovery pump rate that destabilizes the depolarized state of fes and allows the neuron to return to physiological conditions .",
    "these rates are the lower and upper limit of the bistable regime , and low values are physiologically desirable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we see that pump model a , ghk currents and chloride each lead to a lower minimal physiological ( see the inset ) and a lower recovery pump rate than pump model b , nernst currents and the exclusion of chloride .",
    "quantitative differences should be noted , though .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows that all models with pump a have lower minimal physiological pump rates than models with pump b. so the stability of the physiological equilibrium with respect to pump strength reduction depends mostly on the choice of pump .",
    "on the other hand four of the five lowest recovery pump rates are from models that include chloride .",
    "in fact , it is only the combination of both , the ghk current model and pump a , that make the recovery threshold of the chloride excluding model 7 slightly lower than that of the chloride including model 2 .",
    "however , one should note that even the lowest recovery pump rate is as high as @xmath46 @xmath47 ( model 8) .",
    "this is still an almost threefold increase of the normal rate .",
    "so even if we assume pump enhancement due to additional mechanisms , for example increased cerebral blood flow , the threshold for recovery from fes seems to be too high .",
    "thus it is true for a large class of ion  based neuron models that realistic neuronal homeostasis can not rely on na@xmath0/k@xmath0atpase alone , but rather on a combination of ion pumps and further regulation mechanisms like glial buffering .",
    "there is another effect of chloride to be pointed out . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we see that it raises the donnan equilibrium potential ( see potentials at @xmath48 ) significantly . to understand this effect note that without chloride electroneutrality forces the sum of @xmath49 and @xmath50 to be zero , while the presence of the decreasing anion species @xmath51 implies @xmath52 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:36 ] ) this leads to lower donnan equilibrium nernst potentials @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and consequently to a lower membrane potential .",
    "since the conditions of fes for physiological pump rate values are very close to the donnan equilibrium , this depolarized fixed point is shifted in the same way .",
    "the effect of the current model on the two characteristic pump rates is less pronounced than that of chloride or the pump choice .",
    "it lowers the minimal physiological rate more than chloride , but not as much as a pump change from model b to a. its effect on the recovery threshold is the weakest .    while above we describe and investigate minimal hodgkin ",
    "huxley model variants to obtain sd behavior in the simplest neuron model types , in the current literature biophysically much more detailed neuron models have been developed for this phenomenon .",
    "we do not intend to investigate such detailed models thoroughly , but as an example that further demonstrates the robustness of our results , we also replicate our results with a much more detailed membrane model as first described by kager et al.@xcite .",
    "this detailed model contains five different gated ion channels ( transient and persistent sodium , delayed rectifier and transient potassium , and nmda receptor gated currents ) and has been used intensively to study spreading depolarizations and seizure  like activity .",
    "if we replace the unphysiological fixed leak current of this model , i.e. , a leak current with a fixed reversal potential and without associated ion species , with a chloride leak current as in our model and , furthermore , exclude glial buffering , we find the same type of bistability .",
    "the fixed point continuation of this model ( for a complete list of rate equations see@xcite ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_new ] shows that again fes conditions and a physiological state coexist for a large range of pump rates .",
    "this model has slightly different leak conductances and equilibrium ion concentrations , and consequently the characteristic pump rates also differ from ours .",
    "however , the only important thing to note here is that the recovery pump rate defined by the hopf bifurcation of the upper fixed point branch is large compared to the physiological value ( marked by the green square ) , so also in this rather different membrane model recovery from fes due to pump enhancement is practically impossible .",
    "we remark that the physiologically irrelevant unstable fixed point branches in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_new ] do not connect in a saddle  node bifurcation , but saturate for very high pump rates .",
    "the occurrence of the same type of bistability in a hodgkin  huxley  based ion model and this very detailed one , and also the similarity of the sd trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_new ] to those presented in @xcite , support the physiological relevance of the minimal ion  based ansatz that we developed and follow in this paper .",
    "moreover , we assume that bistability is an universal feature also for other more detailed membrane model , which are yet more elaborate variants of the model described by kager et al.@xcite .",
    "we will hence use the model from sec .",
    "model for further investigations .",
    "@xmath47 , the minimal physiological pump rate is @xmath55 @xmath47 , and the recovery rate is @xmath56 @xmath47 . like in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the fixed point line for the corresponding leak ",
    "only model is shaded .",
    "its value at @xmath57 @xmath47 indicates the donnan equilibrium .",
    "[ fig:3_new ] ]      after the overview of different variants of ion content , ion channels , pumps and current models we finally address the role of the neuron geometry .",
    "therefore we vary the membrane surface and the extracellular volume fraction in the model from sec .  model . for the surface variation",
    "we introduce the relative surface size parameter @xmath58 and replace @xmath59 with @xmath60 which implies the replacement ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) ) @xmath61 wherever @xmath62 occurs , i.e. , in the ion rate eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) and the sodium constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) .",
    "the extracellular volume fraction , typically denoted as @xmath63 , is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total volume of the system . when @xmath63 is varied , the above expressions for @xmath66 must be inserted in both ion rate eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) , and in all ion constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq:14])([eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) .",
    "the surface parameter @xmath58 is varied from @xmath67 to 10 , @xmath63 is varied from 2% to 50% .",
    "the standard values of these parameters are @xmath68 and @xmath69% and parameters are understood to take these values when they are not varied .",
    "we start from the bifurcation diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and perform two  parameter continuations of the detected bifurcations to find out how the membrane surface and the volume ratio change the bistable regime .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath71continuation curves are shown in the left and right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we see that the @xmath58 variation has hardly any effect on the bifurcation values of @xmath72 .",
    "this can be understood from the structure of the model .",
    "the fixed point curve is defined by setting the rate eqs .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) , ( [ eq:9 ] ) , ( [ eq:10 ] ) , ( [ eq:13 ] ) to zero and the constraint eqs .",
    "( [ eq:37 ] ) , ( [ eq:38 ] ) , ( [ eq:14])([eq:16 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath58 is varied the only modification to these conditions is in eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) ( sodium constraint ) .",
    "but this modification is of order @xmath73 and does practically not affect the shape of the fixed point curve , so the limit point bifurcations lp1 and lp2 are almost not changed .",
    "hopf bifurcation could be shifted , but a rescaling of the ( initial and dynamical ) ion concentrations by @xmath58 transforms the rate and constraint equations such that @xmath58 only appears in the pump currents .",
    "their derivatives are then multiplied by @xmath58 , but for all hbs the pumps are saturated and hence @xmath58 does not contribute to the jacobian .",
    "the variation of @xmath63 , however , does change the width ( with respect to @xmath72 ) and the threshold values of the bistable regime .",
    "a small value of @xmath63 ( corresponding to a small extracellular space ) reduces the recovery pump rate , and also increases the minimal physiological pump rate .",
    "this means that both , depolarization and recovery , are enhanced .",
    "however , the minimal physiological pump rate is much less affected than the recovery pump rate , so basically a big cell volume supports recovery from the depolarized state .",
    "it is known that in spreading depression ( sd ) , where metastable depolarized states that resemble the energy  starved fixed point of our model occur , the osmotic imbalance of ics and ecs ion concentrations leads to a water influx that makes the cells swell .",
    "our analysis shows that such a process helps the neuron to return to its physiological equilibrium .",
    "extracellular volume fractions of down to 4% are reported in sd , but even for such extreme volume fractions the required recovery pump rate is too high for pump driven recovery of the neuron ( see the lowest value for @xmath74 in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the bifurcation curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] do not saturate for @xmath75% , but , except from the lp1curve that remains very low , bend down , probably due to an approximate symmetry of ics and ecs ion concentration dynamics . in summary also the analysis of different cell geometries confirms that ion homeostasis can not be provided by na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps alone .",
    "for example , in computational models of dynamically changing pump rates due to oxygen consumption maximal rates of twice the physiological values are considered@xcite .    .",

    "the pump rates for which the system is bistable range from the lp1 to the hb3 . the hb3 pump rate is required to repolarize a neuron that is in the depolarized equilibrium .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 ( left plot plus inset ) almost does not change the stability of the system , but @xmath63 ( right plot ) reduces the recovery pump rate significantly .",

    "simulations help to interpret data and guide a principal understanding of the nervous systems in both health and disease .",
    "the hh  formulation of excitability was `` so spectacularly successful that , paradoxically , it created an unrealistic expectation for its rapid application elsewhere '' as noble remarked @xcite . while his statement refers to modeling of cardiac cells it certainly holds true also for neurological diseases and brain injury@xcite . in both fields ,",
    "the incorporation of the na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pump in the original excitability paradigm formulated by hodgkin and huxley is of major importance .",
    "the fundamental structure of such models has to our knowledge not been exploited in neuroscience beyond merely modulating spiking in epileptiform activity @xcite or in models that have energy  starved states@xcite yet without investigating the fundamental bifurcation structure .    as we stressed in the introduction ,",

    "furthermore , a thermodynamic description of osmotic pressure ( which would require a direct insertion of a concentration @xmath76 of a counter anion with valence @xmath3 ) and corresponding changes in cell volume can be included .",
    "there are further physical mechanisms that may alter the dynamics in biophysical ion  based models . at the same time",
    ", we have to avoid `` an excruciating abundance of detail in some aspects , whilst other important facets [ ... ] can only be guessed '' @xcite , like using various new currents but guessing the correct value of the valence @xmath3 of an impermeable counter anion .",
    "for this reason , we decided to use the original ion currents from the hh model .",
    "the comparison of our results to a physilogically more realistic and much more detailed membrane model in fig.[fig:3_new ] support the assumption that the basic structure will not be changed by just adding or modifying gating .",
    "this question has also been addressed experimentally and in simulations by showing that only the simultaneous blockade of all known major cation inward currents did prevent hypoxia  induced depolarization with fes@xcite . in the model@xcite , five different @xmath77 currents were investigated . of course , to apply our model to a particular pathological condition , like migraine which is a channelopathy @xcite ( disease caused by modified gating ) , these details will become important .",
    "this can easily be incorporated in future investigations .",
    "moreover , note that changes in cell volume , which are very important in brain injuries , are in this study only treated by varying it as a parameter .",
    "our bifurcation analysis shows that a whole class of minimal ion  based models is bistable for a large range of pump rates ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "bistable dynamics was suggested by hodgkin to explain spreading depression@xcite , and a corresponding model has been investigated mathematically by huxley but never been published ( cf .  ref .",
    "dahlem and mller suggested to extend this ad hoc approach , i.e. , a single so  called activator variable with a bistable cubic rate function , by including an inhibitory mechanism in form of an inhibitor species with a linear rate function coupled to the activator @xcite .",
    "this , of course , leads to the well known fitzhugh ",
    "nagumo paradigm of excitability type ii@xcite , that is , excitability caused by a hopf bifurcation @xcite , but should not be mistaken as a modification of conductance  based excitability in form of hh  type model in the ` first generation ' and the interpretation as an equivalent electrical circuit .",
    "fitzhugh used his equation in this way , he investigated a long plateau as seen in cardiac action potentials .",
    "dahlem and mller suggested to use the same mathematical structure of an activator  inhibitor type model @xcite to describe a fundamental new physiological mechanism of ionic excitability that originates from bistable ion dynamics .",
    "our current results provide the missing link between this ad hoc activator  inhibitor approach , which has been widely used in migraine and stroke pathophysiology @xcite , and biophysical plausible models .",
    "the major result from this link is the new interpretation of the physiological origin of the proposed inhibitory variable @xcite .",
    "we wrongly interpreted it as being related to the pump rate@xcite .",
    "as our ion  based model shows bistable dynamics , we see it as essentially capturing the activator dynamics of an excitable system and briefly show in figs .",
    "[ fig:1_new ] and [ fig:2_new ] that it can be transformed into such a system by the introduction of a inhibitory process .",
    "vice versa , excitable systems can be reduced to bistable dynamics by singular perturbation methods .",
    "such reductions are referred to as a threshold reduction . from this perspective",
    "our model can be interpreted as the threshold reduction of an excitable system , and we conclude that without contact to an ion bath , physically realistic ion  based models miss an important inhibitory mechanism .",
    "our analysis shows that unlike what we thought before@xcite , ion pumps alone are insufficient .",
    "if the pump rate is temporarily decreased to less than the minimal physiological rate , the neuron depolarizes , and normal pump activity does not suffice to recover the physiological state . depending on the particular model the required recovery pump rates range from three times up to more than 30 times the original value .",
    "these high values suggest that also more detailed pump models that , for example , include the coupling of the maximal pump rate to oxygen or glucose @xcite will not resolve this bistability .",
    "it can , however , also be seen that a regulation term for the extracellular ion concentrations that mimics glial buffering and coupling to the vasculature will allow only monostability .",
    "an additional diffusive coupling to a bath value in the extracellular rate equations forces all such buffered extracellular species to assume the respective bath concentrations .",
    "there are no two points on the solution branch that share the same extracellular potassium concentrations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2_new ] ) .",
    "hence one fixed point is selected , the other state becomes unstable .",
    "we consequently suspect that coupling to some bath ( glia / vasculature ) plays a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis and our results from figs .",
    "[ fig:1_new ] and [ fig:2_new ] confirm that an ion  based model including such coupling will recover from superthreshold perturbations by a large excursion in phase space that is characterized by long transient free energy  starvation .",
    "the authors are grateful for discussions with jens dreier on spreading depolarizations , scientific guidance by michael guevara on ion  based models in myocytes , and steven j.  schiff and nancy kopell , for various helpful discussions .",

    "<S> when neurons fire action potentials , dissipation of free energy is usually not directly considered , because the change in free energy is often negligible compared to the immense reservoir stored in neural transmembrane ion gradients and the long  term energy requirements are met through chemical energy , i.e. , metabolism . </S>",

    "<S> we can in particular conclude that a coupling of extracellular ion concentrations to a large glial  vascular bath can take a role as an inhibitory mechanism crucial in ion homeostasis , while the na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps alone are insufficient to recover from fes . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide the missing link between the hh formalism and activator  inhibitor models that have been successfully used for modeling migraine phenotypes , and therefore will allow us to validate the hypothesis that migraine symptoms are explained by disturbed function in ion channel subunits , na@xmath0/k@xmath0 pumps , and other proteins that regulate ion homeostasis . </S>"
