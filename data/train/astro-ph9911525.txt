    "the direct detection of gravitational radiation presents one of the greatest scientific challenges of our day . with interferometers such as ligo , virgo , geo , and tama @xcite expected to be operating in the next few years , and",
    "a new generation of spherical resonant mass detectors under study @xcite , the calculation of the signals expected from various astrophysical sources has a high priority .",
    "accurate calculations of the waveforms are needed to enable both the detection and identification of sources @xcite .",
    "in particular , short duration bursts are expected to be more difficult to detect than longer - lived signals .",
    "one interesting class of sources includes rapidly rotating compact objects that develop the rotationally - induced `` bar instability '' .",
    "this instability derives its name from the bar - like deformation it induces .",
    "the resultant object is potentially a strong source of gravitational radiation because of its highly nonaxisymmetric structure .",
    "examples of compact astrophysical objects that may rotate rapidly enough to encounter this instability include stellar cores that have expended their nuclear fuel and are prevented from undergoing further collapse by centrifugal forces @xcite ; a neutron star spun up by accretion from a binary companion @xcite ; and the remnant of a compact binary merger @xcite .",
    "such global rotational instabilities in fluids arise from nonaxisymmetric modes @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is known as the `` bar mode '' .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize them by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath4 is the gravitational potential energy @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the _ dynamical _ bar instability , which is driven by newtonian hydrodynamics and gravity , and is expected to be the fastest growing mode .",
    "it operates for fairly large values of the stability parameter @xmath5 and develops on a timescale on the order of the rotation period of the object . for",
    "the uniform density , incompressible , uniformly rotating maclaurin spheroids , @xmath6 . in the case of differentially rotating fluids with a polytropic equation of state ,",
    "the @xmath1 dynamical stability limit @xmath6 has been numerically determined to be valid for initial angular momentum distributions that are similar to those of maclaurin spheroids @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "( we note that when @xmath7 is greater than some critical value @xmath8 , a _",
    "secular _ instability can arise from dissipative processes such as gravitational radiation reaction and viscosity .",
    "when this instability arises , it develops on the timescale of the relevant dissipative mechanism , which can be several rotation periods or longer @xcite . in recent years",
    ", much work has also been carried out on various other modes in rotating relativistic stars as detectable sources of gravitational radiation ; see @xcite for a review and references . )    the first numerical simulations of the dynamical bar instability were carried out by tohline , durisen , and mccollough ( tdm ; @xcite ) in the context of star formation . using a polytropic equation of state , @xmath9 with polytropic index @xmath10 , they evolved differentially rotating axisymmetric models with a 3-d eulerian hydrodynamics code , or hydrocode , in newtonian gravity . in all models with initial @xmath11 ,",
    "the @xmath1 mode grew to nonlinear amplitudes and a two - armed spiral pattern was produced as mass and angular momentum were shed from the ends of the bar .",
    "numerous other simulations have confirmed this basic scenario for the evolution of the bar mode into the nonlinear regime ; see sec .",
    "[ prev_stud ] for references and further discussion .",
    "more recently , these techniques have been extended to the context of rapidly rotating , compact objects in the newtonian regime , with the gravitational waves calculated in the quadrupole limit .",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation for an object , such as a centrifugally - hung stellar core with a density intermediate between that of white dwarfs and neutron stars , with initial mass @xmath12 and radius @xmath13 km , and hence @xmath14 .",
    "centrella and collaborators used both smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) and eulerian finite difference hydrodynamics to evolve the bar instability in a model with @xmath15 @xcite . in all of their runs",
    "the gravitational wave signal was a relatively short duration burst lasting for several bar rotation periods , and the system evolved to a nearly axisymmetric central core surrounded by a flattened , disk - like halo .",
    "new @xcite carried out a similar study , with an improved version of tohline s eulerian code @xcite .",
    "her simulation employed a symmetry condition that only permitted the growth of even modes @xmath16 ; see sec .",
    "[ prev_stud ] .",
    "this simulation produced a final state with a persistent bar - like core , which yielded a gravitational wave signal of much longer duration than that found by centrella and collaborators .",
    "given the requirements of reliable waveforms for the detection and identification of sources , it is important to resolve this issue of the late - time gravitational wave signal from the dynamical bar instability .",
    "to this end , we have carried out a set of long - duration runs using the two eulerian codes employed by new and by centrella in their earlier work , and have made a detailed study of the resulting models . in section  [ prev_stud ]",
    "we review previous numerical studies of the dynamical bar instability , highlighting the various assumptions and restrictions used by different authors .",
    "the numerical techniques we used are discussed in sec .",
    "[ num_tech ] . in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] we present our simulations and analyze the results .",
    "a discussion of these results follows in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "finally , the appendix contains additional information about the two hydrocodes used in this work .",
    "as mentioned above , the work of tdm @xcite set the stage for subsequent numerical calculations of the dynamical bar instability .",
    "their initial models consisted of differentially rotating , axisymmetric equilibrium spheroids with a maclaurin rotation law for the angular momentum distribution .",
    "the maclaurin law produces rigid rotation when it is applied to an incompressible ( @xmath17 ) fluid ; when it is used in a polytrope , it produces differential rotation @xcite . after small amplitude",
    "random perturbations were applied to the density , each model was evolved into the nonlinear regime using a 3-d eulerian hydrocode with newtonian gravity .",
    "this hydrocode solved the mass continuity and euler equations in cylindrical coordinates @xmath18 ; the resulting evolutions were adiabatic and maintained the same polytropic equation of state , eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) .",
    "tdm used equatorial symmetry and `` @xmath19-symmetry '' in their simulations .",
    "equatorial symmetry is a reflection symmetry through the equatorial plane @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath19-symmetry condition imposes periodic boundary conditions at angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; thus , physical variables are the same in the interval @xmath23 as they are in @xmath24 .",
    "it is computationally advantageous to impose an equatorial- and/or @xmath25 symmetry condition on such a simulation because , by doing so , half as many computational grid zones are required in order to achieve a given spatial resolution in the vertical and/or azimuthal coordinate directions , respectively .",
    "it was also physically reasonable for tdm to adopt both of these symmetry conditions because the eigenfunction ( a pure , @xmath1 barmode ) to which their models were expected to be initially unstable had both equatorial and @xmath25symmetry @xcite .",
    "as we discuss more fully below , ultimately one would like to remove these computational constraints in order to test whether or not the physical outcome is sensitive to them .",
    "the first work to address the late - time development of the bar instability was published by durisen , gingold , tohline , and boss @xcite , who ran simulations with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath15 polytropes .",
    "they used three different 3-d hydrocodes : tohline s eulerian code as used in tdm , another eulerian code developed in spherical coordinates by boss , and an sph code developed by gingold .",
    "boss s code also enforced equatorial- and @xmath19-symmetries but , being gridless , gingold s sph code imposed neither of these symmetries .",
    "however , the sph simulations were limited to a very small number of particles , @xmath28 .",
    "the results produced by these three separate simulation codes were qualitatively similar .",
    "for example , at early times all simulations showed evidence of the development of a bar - like pattern instability , consistent with the results of tdm and the predictions of linear perturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "peturbative analysis says this instability is the result of the growth of a coherent bar - like wave that propagates around the system with a well - defined pattern speed , while material moves differentially through that pattern . at subsequent times in the simulations ,",
    "the barmode distortion developed into a two - armed , trailing spiral pattern as described by tdm ; when the spiral pattern reached a nonlinear amplitude , some relatively high specific angular momentum material was expelled in the equatorial plane of each system ; and the primary structure that remained at the end of each simulation was a dynamically stable , centrally condensed object exhibiting a value of @xmath29 .",
    "but there were significant quantitative differences among the various evolutions presented by durisen et al .",
    "for example , the simulations produced central remnants that had different total masses and exhibited different degrees of nonaxisymmetric distortion .",
    "this disagreement signified , in part , that the simulation techniques being used were rather primitive and , in part , that the available computing resources did not permit the simulations to be carried out with adequate spatial resolution .",
    "williams and tohline subsequently carried out an investigation of the dynamical barmode instability in models with different polytropic indices . using the tdm code with @xmath19-symmetry and an improved azimuthal grid resolution , they first considered models with initial @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and focused their analysis on the measurement of barmode growth rates and pattern speeds in the linear - amplitude growth regime @xcite . the runs with @xmath33 and @xmath34 were then extended to later times through the development of nonlinear - amplitude nonaxisymmetric structures and yielded a rotating triaxial central remnant @xcite .",
    "williams and tohline noted that such a configuration would be of interest when viewed in the context of compact stellar objects because `` its existence would presumably be discernable from the spectrum of any emitted gravity wave radiation , '' but they did not derive such a spectrum from their models .",
    "houser , centrella , and smith @xcite were the next to carry out 3-d simulations of the dynamical bar instability for the case @xmath10 and initial @xmath35 , this time in the context of rapidly rotating stellar cores .",
    "using both an sph and an eulerian code , they considered the matter to be a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the specific internal energy , and solved an equation for the internal energy . using artificial viscosity ,",
    "they could account for the energy generation by shocks that occurs when the spiral arms form and deflect the streamlines of the supersonically moving fluid .",
    "routines were added to calculate the gravitational waveforms and luminosities in the quadrupole approximation .",
    "the sph code ( developed from treesph ; see @xcite ) imposed no symmetry restrictions and was run with up to @xmath38 particles .",
    "their eulerian code , written in cylindrical coordinates , imposed symmetry through the equatorial plane but not @xmath19-symmetry @xcite .",
    "overall , their simulations produced nearly axisymmetric central remnants at late times .    houser and centrella @xcite carried out additional sph simulations with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and initial @xmath41 using improved initial models with @xmath42 particles .",
    "as before , the @xmath15 case resulted in an almost axisymmetric central remnant and a correspondingly short burst of gravitational radiation . the runs with @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 underwent additional episodes of spiral arm ejection , with the number of episodes increasing as @xmath45 decreased ; such behavior was also observed by williams and tohline @xcite .",
    "this resulted in longer - lived nonaxisymmetric structure in the central remnants , accompanied by longer duration gravitational waveforms as the models grew stiffer ( i.e. , as @xmath45 was decreased ) .",
    "note that the relatively small number of particles present in the sph simulations of centrella and collaborators , accompanied by the velocity dispersion in their initial models , may make it difficult for models with softer equations of state ( larger @xmath45 ) to maintain long - lived nonaxisymmetric structures .",
    "new @xcite used an improved version of tohline s code @xcite to study the @xmath15 , @xmath46 case .",
    "this code solves an energy equation and incorporates artificial viscosity to handle the shocks .",
    "she added a routine to calculate the gravitational radiation in the quadrupole limit .",
    "her simulation , which imposed both equatorial and @xmath25symmetries , produced a persistent bar structure and a long - duration gravitational waveform .",
    "all of the studies mentioned above in this section started from initially axisymmetric models with the same radial distribution of specific angular momentum as in a maclaurin spheroid .",
    "pickett , durisen , and davis @xcite studied the instabilities that result in an @xmath15 polytrope , when the angular momentum distribution is varied .",
    "they used a ( different ) updated version of tohline s code with neither equatorial plane symmetry nor @xmath19-symmetry imposed ; all their evolutions were adiabatic . using the maclaurin rotation law , they evolved a model with initial @xmath47 to late times , and obtained a bar - shaped central remnant .",
    "recently imamura , durisen , and pickett @xcite have performed additional adiabatic simulations of dynamical instabilities in @xmath15 and @xmath48 polytropes with the maclaurin rotation law , using the same hydrodynamics code used in @xcite .",
    "they focused on comparing the early phases of nonlinear mode growth in their runs with the predictions of quasi - linear approximations .",
    "their high resolution simulations of @xmath15 polytropes with @xmath49 and @xmath50 both resulted in bar - like endstates .",
    "the properties and outcomes of the long duration bar mode runs with @xmath10 and @xmath34 are summarized in table  [ long_runs ] for convenience .",
    "all of the times reported in table  [ long_runs ] are given in units of @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is defined as one central initial rotation period ( cirp ) .",
    "when surveying the information catalogued in table i , one should keep in mind that the identified `` final '' state has been reported at different evolutionary times in the various references . as this table emphasizes , over the fifteen years that have passed since the original durisen et al .",
    "comparison paper @xcite , there remain significant quantitative differences among the results of various published simulations of the bar mode instability . in particular , as indicated by our comments under the `` remarks '' column , these previous simulations do not clearly indicate whether or not the end product of the evolution should be a central , steady - state structure that has a bar - like geometry .",
    "the new simulations of the dynamical bar instability presented here begin with rotating spheroidal models above the maclaurin stability limit , @xmath52 , constructed in hydrostatic equilibrium . for fluids rotating about the @xmath53axis with angular velocity @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the distance from the rotation axis , the equations of motion reduce to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the centrifugal potential and",
