    "an _ embedded soliton _ ( es ) is an isolated solitary wave in a non - integrable system that resides insides the continuous spectrum of linear waves . unlike regular _ gap solitons _ , the existence of ess in continuum models is generally of codimension - one in the model s parameter space .",
    "that is , they are embedded into wider families of _ generalized _ solitary waves which have nonvanishing periodic tails attached to them , such that the es occurs at isolated values of the frequency , or other intrinsic parameter of the solution family at which the tail s amplitude vanishes .",
    "the concept of ess was introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details ) , although particular examples of waves of this kind were actually known earlier ( but not under this name ) @xcite . in the last few years ,",
    "ess have been shown to be of relevance in a diverse range of nonlinear - wave models , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein .",
    "one of their characteristic properties is that they are typically , at best , _ semi - stable_. that is , the linearization around them gives rise to no unstable eigenvalues , but a non - trivial zero - eigenvalue mode can be found .",
    "the latter leads to an algebraic - in - time instability for energy - decreasing perturbations , and a similar algebraic - in - time relaxation back to the original pulse for energy - increasing perturbations @xcite . only in special cases of systems which have more than one dynamical invariant , or",
    "for which the travelling - wave system is reversible but not hamiltonian , have examples been found of ess that are truly asymptotically stable @xcite .",
    "also known are physically relevant models with special symmetries that support continuous ( rather than discrete ) families of ess , and a large part thereof may be stable @xcite .",
    "all the above - cited examples pertain to continuum models .",
    "a fundamental issue is whether solitons of the embedded type may also occur in discrete nonlinear equations modelling dynamical lattices .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was argued that moving topological defects in frenkel - kontorova ( discrete sine - gordon ) lattices can meaningfully be described as _ embedded kinks_. some of specific examples of moving discrete solitons constructed by means of the _ inverse method _",
    "( a model is sought for to which a given moving soliton is an exact solution @xcite ) may also have the embedded character .",
    "such waves , which connect a zero state to itself , translated through a multiple of the period of the lattice potential ( the ` topological charge ' ) , were first ( indirectly ) identified by peyrard and kruskal @xcite and have later received much attention in a wide variety of applications @xcite . in a co - moving frame , these waves should be thought of as localized solutions to infinite - dimensional _ advance and delay _ ( nonlocal ) equations , see works @xcite where branches of embedded kinks with the topological charge 1 and 2 were computed .",
    "another recent study @xcite reported the existence of ess in a discrete lattice of the ablowitz - ladik type , but with a quintic nonlinearity added to the usual cubic terms , and also with an additional next - nearest - neighbor linear coupling . by tuning the nonlinear terms , an explicit analytical solution for a discrete es was found in that model ( which somehow resembles the above - mentioned inverse method ) .",
    "apart from these , we are aware of no other work that systematically considers the issue of ess in discrete models .",
    "a general objective of this paper is to understand the existence and multiplicity properties of discrete solitons in lattice systems for which the corresponding continuum model is known to support ess .",
    "the first fundamental issue is whether the codimension of their existence is preserved under discretization . in dissipative systems ,",
    "solitary pulses are supported due to the balance between forcing and damping , hence the corresponding homoclinic orbits are always of codimension one .",
    "thus , formally similar to ess , dissipative solitons typically exist as solutions to the corresponding stationary ordinary differential equation at discrete values of a relevant parameter ( temporal or spatial frequency , depending on the physical realization ) .",
    "then , it will generically happen that , under the discretization of that equation , the codimension of the solitons _",
    "decreases_. this is possible because discretization of homoclinic orbits to hyperbolic equilibria leads to transverse homoclinic connections that exist for a range of parameter values @xcite .",
    "however , for ess we shall show that , in contrast , discrete ess typically keep _ the same _ codimension as their continuum counterparts , i.e. , they also exist at discrete values of the corresponding physical parameter .    in this work",
    ", we restrict ourselves to a discretization of a single continuum model , for which the discrete counterpart finds a direct physical interpretation . in fact",
    ", our results and methodology will carry over to other discretized models that support ess ( this expectation is supported by the general fact that equations of the discrete nonlinear - schrdinger type , that we consider below , may be derived as an asymptotic limit from a much larger class of discrete models @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we shall start with the continuum model in which ess were identified @xcite .",
    "it describes an optical medium with competing quadratic ( @xmath0 ) and cubic ( @xmath1 ) nonlinearities ( see @xcite and references therein for physical applications ) . in this model ,",
    "the evolution variable @xmath2 is the propagation distance in the nonlinear optical waveguide , and the variable @xmath3 is either the reduced time ( in the case of temporal solitons ) or , which is more physically relevant , a transverse spatial coordinate in a planar waveguide . in the temporal case",
    ", such a model can be written in dimensionless form as ( see detailed explanations in reviews @xcite ) @xmath4 & &   \\label{eqn : pde } \\\\[-1ex ] & & i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}+\\frac{\\delta } { 2}\\frac{\\partial ^{2}v}{\\partial t^{2}}+qv+\\frac{1}{2}u^{2}+2\\gamma _ { 2}(|v|^{2}+2|u|^{2})v=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the local amplitudes of the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and second - harmonic ( sh ) fields , an asterisk denotes complex conjugation , @xmath7 is the relative dispersion of the sh , @xmath8 is the wavenumber mismatch , and @xmath9 measure the relative strength of the cubic ( kerr ) nonlinearity compared to its quadratic ( sh - generating ) counterpart , whose strength is normalized to be @xmath10 . in the physical model , @xmath11 must have the same sign ( typically , they are positive , but may , in principle , be negative too ) . the spatial variant of the system ( [ eqn : pde ] ) takes the same form , with a partly different interpretation of the dimensionless parameters , and is easier to implement experimentally @xcite . in the spatial domain , one always has @xmath12 .",
    "the existence of ess in this model was established in @xcite for both cases , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the case of relevance to spatial waveguides ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "fundamental ess are absent in the model , while higher - order ones can be found .    in models such as ( [ eqn : pde ] ) which includes @xmath0 interaction ,",
    "ess can be embedded only in the continuous spectrum of the sh component , while the ff wavenumber can never be located inside the continuous spectrum .",
    "this feature is stipulated by the asymmetry between the two equations in system ( [ eqn : pde ] ) .",
    "if the sh supports linear waves , while the ff has the possibility of exponential localization like @xmath16 , then the @xmath17 term , which drives the sh field in the second equation ( [ eqn : pde ] ) , allows it to have tails that decay exponentially at a rate @xmath18 .",
    "such a solitary wave was said in reference @xcite to be _ tail - locked _ and , accordingly , the sh equation to be _ nonlinearisable _",
    "( because the quadratic term can never be neglected in this equation ) . the tail locking does not take place if the sh field supports its own exponentially decaying tails that asymptotically ( for @xmath19 ) dominate over the tails induced by the term @xmath17 .",
    "in this paper we study the existence of discrete ess in a model arising from discretization of the ( actually , spatial ) @xmath3-coordinate in ( [ eqn : pde ] ) .",
    "one motivation for doing this is to understand the effect of numerical approximation ( which also implies discretization , once a finite - difference scheme is employed ) on the computation of ess in model systems .",
    "but this is not our primary motivation .",
    "lattice models play an increasingly important role in describing physical phenomena in a number of newly developed experimental settings . in particular",
    ", the discrete version of the @xmath20 model describes an array of the corresponding linearly - coupled waveguides .",
    "the creation of discrete spatial solitons in a system of channel waveguides with the @xmath0 nonlinearity was recently reported @xcite .",
    "our assumption concerning relevant solutions is that , once the continuum version of the model readily gives rise to ess , then there is a chance to find them in the corresponding lattice model too . in this paper , we show that this is the case indeed and investigate how we may then pass to the continuum limit .",
    "we report the corresponding discrete es that can be found , under special conditions , in an approximate analytical form , and , in the general case , numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we present the lattice model to be considered in this work and discuss its physical applicability . in section  3",
    ", an asymptotic analysis is undertaken for a reduced model where the cubic nonlinearity is present only at a single site .",
    "section  4 then goes on to discuss the meaning of discrete ess , as a solution to a system of stationary finite - difference equations , in terms of a homoclinic orbit to a fixed point of a discrete - time reversible map .",
    "this makes it possible to understand that the solutions we seek must have codimension one , similar to ess in continuum models . in terms of the same approach , in section  5",
    "we describe the numerical procedure developed to search for discrete es solutions .",
    "note that this requires special adaptation or other methods for finding homoclinic orbits of maps , owing to the non - hyperbolic nature of the fixed point .",
    "our approach heavily relies on the reversibility although it can be readily modified to treat non - reversible ess .",
    "numerical results are reported in section  6 , in the form of the corresponding codimension - one solution branches in the parameter space .",
    "an array of actual shapes of the ess is displayed too .",
    "our numerical results also show that the asymptotic analysis of section  3 can well predict the codimension - one set of ess in the parameter space in the model when the wavenumber is large .",
    "the paper is concluded by section  7 along with a preliminary stability result for the fundamental es .",
    "we now consider eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : pde ] ) in the spatial domain .",
    "direct discretization of the spatial second derivative produces a lattice model @xmath21 & &   \\label{eqn : lattice } \\\\[-1ex ] & & i\\frac{dv_{n}}{dz}+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta d(v_{n+1}+v_{n-1}-2v_{n})+qv_{n}+\\frac{1}{2}u_{n}^{2}+2\\gamma _ { 2}(|v_{n}|^{2}+2|u_{n}|^{2})v_{n}=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath22 is the discrete transverse coordinate which assumes integer values , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 the stepsize of the discretization .",
    "effective coefficients of the lattice diffraction for the ff and sh waves are @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; with @xmath15 , this yields @xmath27 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : lattice ] ) .",
    "unequal values of these coefficients , @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) , including those with _ opposite signs _ , can in principle be realized experimentally ( the latter possibility was recently employed to predict the existence of discrete gap solitons @xcite ) .",
    "to do this one would use a _ diffraction - management _ technique , which is based on oblique propagation of the beam across the waveguide array which is modeled by the discrete system @xcite . in that case , the effective lattice - diffraction coefficients are @xmath30where @xmath31 is the transverse wavenumber , @xmath32 is the beam s wavenumber ( normalization is such that the array spacing is unity ) , @xmath33 is the angle between the poynting vector and the coordinate @xmath2 running along the waveguides , and @xmath34 are the original lattice - dispersion coefficients , corresponding to @xmath35 . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ management ] ) , one can efficiently control the size and signs of @xmath36 by choosing an appropriate angle @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , the ratio @xmath37 can be made large by choosing @xmath38 , or @xmath39 , for a small positive @xmath40 .    to cast the model in a normalized form",
    ", we note that @xmath41 can be made positive , if it was originally negative , by means of the complex conjugation ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : lattice ] ) are replaced by their counterparts for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , combined with the changes @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the size of @xmath41 may be set equal to @xmath10 by means of the rescaling : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which leads to the final normalized form of the discrete model , @xmath48 & &   \\label{normalised } \\\\[-1ex ] & & i\\frac{dv_{n}}{dz}+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta(v_{n+1}+v_{n-1}-2v_{n } ) + \\tilde{q}v_{n}+\\frac{1}{2}u_{n}^{2 } + 2\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}(|v_{n}|^{2}+2|u_{n}|^{2})v_{n}=0 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 the dimensionless constants ( [ delta ] ) , including @xmath50 , may , in general , be positive , zero , or negative .    to obtain some analytical results",
    ", we shall also introduce a simplified model where ess can be found in approximate form .",
    "in the simplified model , only the central site ( the one corresponding to @xmath51 ) carries the kerr nonlinearity .",
    "such a model is physically feasible too , if the central waveguide in the array is doped to enhance its kerr nonlinearity .",
    "thus , the simplified model is based on the equations @xmath52 & &   \\label{eqn : mod } \\\\[-1ex ] & & i\\frac{d v_{n}}{d z } + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta \\left(v_{n+1}+v_{n-1}-2v_{n}\\right ) + \\tilde{q}v_{n}+\\frac{1}{2}u_{n}^{2 } + 2\\tilde{\\gamma}_{2}\\epsilon_{n}\\left(|v_{0}|^{2}+2|u_{0}|^{2}\\right)v_{0}=0 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath51 .    in either model , ( [ eqn : lattice ] ) or ( [ eqn : mod ] ) , the es corresponds to a solution with ff component exponentially localized : @xmath56where @xmath57 is a real amplitude and @xmath58 is positive and real .",
    "simultaneously , the propagation constant @xmath59 must belong to the _ phonon band _ of the sh equation .",
    "that is , the sh component of the solution generically will have a nonvanishing tail , of the form @xmath60where @xmath61 is real .",
    "the existence of an es corresponds to the vanishing of the constant @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ vasympt ] ) .",
    "linearization of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : lattice ] ) and ( [ eqn : mod ] ) and subsequent substitution of expressions ( [ uasympt ] ) and ( [ vasympt ] ) yield the following relations : @xmath63@xmath64from eqs .",
    "( [ k ] ) and ( [ q ] ) we see that a discrete es may exist in the case of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 belonging to the region @xmath67depending on whether @xmath7 is positive or not .",
    "note that we can only choose @xmath59 , @xmath66 and @xmath7 independently in the set of @xmath68 since @xmath58 and @xmath61 are determined by the other three parameters via eqs .",
    "( [ k ] ) and ( [ q ] ) .",
    "we first consider the simplified model ( [ eqn : mod ] ) , with the @xmath69 nonlinearity present only at the central site . an es solution is sought asymptotically under the assumption that @xmath70 , the validity of which will be checked _",
    "a posteriori_. accordingly , the quadratic term in the first equation of the system ( [ eqn : mod ] ) may be dropped to first approximation , which makes the expressions ( [ uasympt ] ) and ( [ k ] ) an _ exact solution _ for @xmath54 . at the point @xmath51 , the cross - phase - modulation term , @xmath71 , in the first equation ( [ eqn : mod ] ) may be dropped too to leading order . then , the equation at @xmath51 yields a final result for the ff component of the soliton , @xmath72 , which implies that the discrete soliton in the ff component is supported by itself , without coupling to the sh component .",
    "further , using eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) one can express @xmath73 in terms of @xmath59 , @xmath74 which means that the solution exists only in the case of @xmath75 .",

    ", an exact solution can be found , which precisely corresponds to an es , as it does not contain the nonvanishing tail ( [ vasympt ] ) and is ` tail - locked ' to the square of the ff field , as explained in the introduction .",

    "using the relations ( [ k ] ) and ( [ eqn : lambda ] ) , we obtain @xmath84which is positive by virtue of ( [ eqn:12 ] ) .",
    "this result selects the _ single value _ of @xmath59 at which the simplified model admits the existence of an es , with tail - locked sh component .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) that such a solution exists if the relative lattice - diffraction coefficient ( see eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) ) belongs to the interval @xmath85where @xmath7 and @xmath82 must be of the same sign .",
    "it is now necessary to check compatibility of the solution with the underlying assumption , @xmath79 , which implies @xmath86 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ak ] ) and ( [ b ] ) ) .",
    "straightforward consideration shows that this condition amounts to @xmath87 .",
    "we also note that , if the ff component of the soliton is strongly localized , so that @xmath88 ( see eq .",
    "( [ uasympt ] ) ) , the simplified model is actually equivalent to the full one , as the nonlinearity in the first equation of ( [ eqn : lattice ] ) is then negligible at @xmath54 . from ( [ k ] )",
    "we see that this condition implies that @xmath59 must be large and hence , from ( [ final ] ) , that @xmath89 .    a noteworthy feature of eqs .",
    "( [ final ] ) and ( [ 12 + ] ) is that they do not involve the mismatch parameter @xmath66 .",
    "however , the condition that the soliton found above is embedded implies that @xmath59 given by eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) must belong to the interval ( [ area ] ) , which relates @xmath59 to @xmath66 , as @xmath89 .",
    "this approximate analysis , valid too for the original model in the limit of small @xmath90 , means that , for an isolated selected @xmath59-value given by ( [ final ] ) , there exists a curve of single - humped ess approximately parametrized by @xmath66 in the narrow interval @xmath91 in the @xmath92-plane for @xmath50 fixed .",
    "let us now consider the model ( [ eqn : lattice ] ) in the general case , and understand , from a dynamical systems point of view , why discrete ess should exist . in this context ,",
    "one of essential issues is the transition to the continuum limit .",
