    "unlike a classical particle , the transport of a quantum particle through a system is greatly influenced by the interference and tunneling effects . while the availability of a spanning path is the sole criteria for the transmittance of a classical particle through a system , a quantum particle may exhibit zero or very low transmittance even for a completely ordered system depending on details such as the boundary condition or the energy of the particle @xcite .",
    "the quantum percolation system that we have investigated here includes the interference effect but does not include the tunneling effect .",
    "we , thus , expect a higher connectivity in underlying geometry to be required for non - zero transmission compared to its classical counterpart .    a major motivation for studying such a system is the question of whether a localized - to - delocalized ( or perhaps , metal - to - insulator ) transition exists in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system .",
    "the anderson model and the quantum percolation model are two of the more common theoretical models that are used to study the transport properties of disordered systems .",
    "while the literature on both models agree on the existence of such a transition in three dimensions @xcite , the same question for quantum percolation in two dimensions appears to have remained a subject of controversy for over two decades .",
    "based on the one - parameter scaling theory of abrahams et al @xcite , it was widely believed that there can be no metal - to - insulator transition in 2d universally in the absence of a magnetic field or interactions for any amount of disorder .",
    "moreover , the scaling theory predicts that all states are exponentially localized in thermodynamic limit for any amount of disorder and therefore that no transition exists except at zero dilution .",
    "( however , see goldenfeld and haydock@xcite which asserts the existence of a transition between two different kinds of localized regimes at a finite disorder in addition to a localized - delocalized transition at an infinitesimal dilution , even for the anderson model in two dimensions . )    however , whether the scaling theory also applies to quantum percolation has been debated in recent years . even restricting attention to quantum percolation which lacks many effects that are expected to play important roles in metal - insulator transitions ,",
    "there is a long - standing controversy as to the presence or absence of an extended state and of a phase transition between the prevalent localized state and a more elusive extended state in two - dimensions . on one hand ,",
    "some studies such as those made using the dlog pad approximation method @xcite , real space renormalization method @xcite , and the inverse participation ratio @xcite found a transition from exponentially localized states to non - exponentially localized states for a range of site concentrations between @xmath3 on the square lattice .",
    "so did a study of energy level statistics @xcite , one of the spread of a wave packet initially localized at a site @xcite , and one of a transfer matrix @xcite , where the nature of the delocalized state remained not fully understood . on the other hand ,",
    "studies such as the scaling work based on numerical calculation of the conductance @xcite , the investigation of vibration - diffusion analogy @xcite , finite - size scaling analysis and transfer matrix methods @xcite , and vector recursion technique @xcite found no evidence of a transition . a study by inui _",
    "_ @xcite found all states to be localized except for those with particle energies at the middle of the band and when the underlying lattice is bipartite , such as a square lattice .",
    "more recently , cuansing and nakanishi @xcite used an approach first suggested by daboul _ at al .",
    "_ @xcite to calculate conductance directly for clusters of up to several hundred sites and , extrapolating those results by finite - size scaling , suggested that delocalized states exist and thus a transition would have to exist as well .",
    "the current paper extends the relevant portion of the latter work by studying much larger clusters , which has allowed considerably more detailed analyses .    in the mean time , experiments performed in early 1980 s on different 2d systems @xcite confirmed the scaling theory predictions .",
    "however , a number of experiments on dilute low disordered si mosfet and gaas / algaas heterostructures that appeared more recently seem to suggest that a metallic state may be possible in two dimensions @xcite . for reviews of these experiments ,",
    "see abrahams _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein .    in this work",
    ", we do not address the issues of these experiments , but rather concentrate on the formally much simpler quantum percolation model which has neither magnetic field nor interactions but contains binary disorder with infinite barriers at randomly diluted sites .",
    "previously we have investigated the same problem using a dynamical approach where we have studied the properties of a disordered system by tracking how a quantum particle , described by a wave packet , propagates through the system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt a stationary state approach where we calculate the transmission characteristics by solving time independent schrdinger equation for tight binding hamiltonian . in section",
    "ii we describe the model and the numerical approach used in this work . in section iii",
    "we discuss the numerical results and in section iv we present the summary and conclusion of our study .",
    "we study quantum percolation that is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are tight binding basis functions at sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element which is equal to zero if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not nearest neighbors .",
    "we have realized this model on both square and triangular lattices that can have at most 4 and 6 nearest neighbors , respectively .",
    "if the system is completely ordered , @xmath10 ( uniform ) and @xmath11 sets the overall energy scale , where we use @xmath12 as the nominal standard value . on the other hand ,",
    "since in this work we are interested in transport through a disordered system , we will introduce random dilution by removing a fraction of sites from the lattice and set @xmath13 for the bonds between the diluted sites and their neighbors .",
    "@xmath13 for nearest neighbors @xmath7 and @xmath8 means that an infinite barrier exists between the pair of sites .",
    "to study the transmission of a quantum particle we connect two semi - infinite 1d leads , one as the input and the other as the output lead , to the 2d cluster .",
    "although the system can be studied using different types of connection of the leads , in this study we only use a point - to - point type contact where the input lead is connected to only one lattice site on the input side edge of the cluster and the output lead is connected also to only one lattice site on the opposite edge of the cluster .",
    "another possible connection type is the busbar type contact , where all the lattice points on the input side edge of the cluster are connected to the input lead , while all the lattice points on the output side of the cluster are connected to the output lead .",
    "[ sq_lat ] and  [ tri_lat ] illustrate the connection of the leads for the square and the triangular lattices respectively .",
    "+ ( a ) ( b )    \\(a ) ( b )    the wave function of the entire cluster - lead system can be calculated by solving the time independent schrdinger equation :    @xmath14    and @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are the input and output chain part of the wave function respectively . + since the leads are of infinite length , the matrix form of the schrdinger equation ( eq .  [ eq2 ] ) becomes an infinite size problem . to reduce it to a numerically finite problem we use an ansatz proposed by daboul _",
    "@xcite which assumes that the input and output part of the wave function are of the form of plane waves :    @xmath18    where _ r _ is the amplitude of reflected wave , _ t _ is the amplitude of the transmitted wave .",
    "this ansatz is consistent with the schrdinger equation only for the wave vector @xmath19 that is related to the energy _",
    "e _ by    @xmath20    using this ansatz along with the energy restriction eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , the matrix equation for a @xmath21 cluster connected to semi - infinite chains ( fig .",
    "[ sq_lat]a ) reduces to ( for details see reference @xcite )    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the coupling of the leads with the cluster and its value is set to 1 for all the calculations done in this work .",
    "the effect of @xmath24 on transmission is discussed in one of our previous works @xcite .",
    "the busbar configuration of fig .",
    "[ sq_lat ] ( b ) has a similar expression .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is the exact expression for a 2d system connected to semi - infinite chains with continuous eigenvalues ranging between -2 and + 2 .",
    "the spectrum is continuous because it is still effectively infinite and it is non - degenerate except for the reversal of left and right .",
    "the main advantage of using this ansatz is that it not only allows us to calculate the wave function but also helps us to study the transmission characteristics of the corresponding state directly .",
    "the transmission and the reflection coefficients are obtained by taking the absolute square of _ t _ and _ r _ respectively , ie @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a disadvantage on the other hand is that eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) that relates the wave vector of the incident particle with the energy , restricts the energy of the particle to between -2 and + 2 .",
    "this restricts our ability to study the system in the whole possible energy range since for our system the energy could in principle range between -4 and + 4 .",
    "this is due , of course , to the effectively one - dimensional nature of the system forced by attaching 1d semi - infinite leads and by looking at plane waves spreading over the entire leads .",
    "the model that we are using to calculate transmission has two adjustable parameters , namely the energy of the particle , e and the amount of disorder present in the system , q ( probability that a given site is not available to the hopping particle ) . to study the presence or absence of a localization - delocalization transition",
    ", one needs to investigate the behavior of the 2d system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this , however , is not possible in numerical methods , and therefore , we resort to a finite size scaling approach in which we calculate the transmission while gradually increasing the size of the system for a given amount of disorder .",
    "the result is then extrapolated to study the bulk behavior in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "though there are many combinations possible for connecting the input and the output leads with the cluster , for the work that follows , the leads are connected diagonally with the clusters , since this arrangement generally gives higher transmission .",
    "in addition to that , to minimize the effect of the boundary on the interior property of the disordered clusters , we made good contacts by keeping the nine sites nearest to both the input and the output contact points always occupied ( that is , available to the hopping particle ) .",
    "we calculate the transmission as a function of the system size for many levels of disorder and at different energies .",
    "the general trend for all the transmission curves at different energies are similar , so we will discuss here only two energies , one that is away from the band center and one very close to the band center .",
    "we first study the transmission at energy @xmath27 for different levels of disorder .",
    "for each level of disorder , we have calculated the transmission by gradually increasing the size of the clusters from @xmath28 to a maximum size of @xmath29 .",
    "we have randomly generated one thousand clusters of a given size for each level of disorder and average transmission is calculated for each size of the cluster and each level of disorder .",
    "the log - log plot of transmission against the size of the clusters at @xmath27 is shown for various disorder levels in the fig .",
    "[ tvsl1 ] .",
    "+    we observe from fig .",
    "[ tvsl1 ] that at lower disorder transmission decreases almost linearly in the log - log plot as the size of the clusters increases , suggesting a power - law behavior of transmission in linear scale .",
    "this trend continues until disorder , q , increases to about 28% . above that",
    ", transmission falls exponentially as is evident from the lowest three curves in fig .",
    "[ tvsl1 ] .",
    "we have fitted the data both to power - laws and exponentials and the best fit forms along with the corresponding fitting parameters and coefficient of regression , @xmath30 , for different levels of disorder are presented in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "although there are many data points that appear to be several @xmath31 s from the best fit exponentials particularly for higher disorder , they are believed to be due to the discrete and loose - packed structure of the lattice and not due to some unknown systematic errors .",
    "( the transmission curves of the 13% and 26% disorder are not shown in the fig .",
    "[ tvsl1 ] since they are very close to the nearby transmission curves ) .",
    ".table for fitting parameters at @xmath27 . shown in the parentheses",
    "are the lower and upper bounds for 95% confidence level . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our study , thus , suggests that at lower disorder states are delocalized , contrary to the one parameter scaling theory of abrahams _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to delocalized transition we observe a second kind of phase transition between the power - law to exponentially localized regimes .",
    "for all energies considered in this work , except for those close to @xmath1 , the delocalized states appear if the disorder is less than about 15% . above 15% , there exist two different localization regimes . for intermediate energies ( @xmath32 ) , states of the particle",
    "show a weaker form of localization characterized by a power - law size dependence of transmission for the range of disorder between 15% to @xmath33 . above this range",
    "all states are localized exponentially . for energies close to @xmath34 ,",
    "the width of this power - law localization regime is reduced and states become exponentially localized even for 25% disorder .",
    "the transmission near the band center , however , differs in some important ways compared to that at other energies . at @xmath35",
    ", transmission is very low in the thermodynamic limit even for very low disorder .",
    "though it is difficult to locate the delocalization transition because of the low transmission , our finite size analysis does show a behavior much weaker than power - law localization ( inset of fig .",
    "[ tvsl3 ] ) .",
    "the width of the power - law localization regime is very small and exponentially localized states appear for disorder as low as 9% .",
