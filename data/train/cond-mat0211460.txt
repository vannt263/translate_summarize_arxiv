    "<S> we investigate a non - adiabatic parametric quantum pump consists of a nonmagnetic scattering region connected by two ferromagnetic leads . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of ferromagnetic leads allows electrons with different spins to experience different potential landscape . using this effect </S>",
    "<S> we propose a quantum spin pump that drives spin - up electrons to flow in one direction and spin - down electrons to flow in opposite direction . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the spin pump can deliver a spin current with vanishing charge current .    </S>",
    "<S> a parametric quantum pump generates a dc electric current by a cyclic variation of system parameters while keeping the leads at a constant chemical potential@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considerable effort has been devoted to understand the physics of parametric pumping@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the pumped current is rather sensitive to various parameters of the system such as potential of the pump , frequency of the driving force , and fermi energy of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> as parameters vary , the pumped current can even change directions : this has been predicted for charge pumping in resonant tunneling diodes@xcite , nanotube quantum pumps@xcite , finite frequency pumping process@xcite , and quantization of the pumped charge@xcite . to fully exploit this behavior , in this paper we investigate parametric pumping in the presence of ferromagnetic leads . </S>",
    "<S> when ferromagnetic leads are present , electrons with different spins experience different potentials . under certain conditions </S>",
    "<S> the pumped current for electron with different spin may flow in opposite directions . as a result , the total pumped charge current can be zero while a pure spin current is delivered . </S>",
    "<S> such a quantum spin pump may have potential applications in the fascinating field of spintronics@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , several different spin pumps have been proposed . in the uni - pole spin battery studied in refs . </S>",
    "<S> , a spin current is generated by either a rotating magnetic moment or rotating external magnetic field . in these uni - pole pumps , spin current </S>",
    "<S> is not conserved due to spin flips@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the spin pump considered in this work satisfies spin current conservation when magnetizations of the two leads are parallel or antiparallel . in another direction , </S>",
    "<S> an adiabatic quantum pump was proposed@xcite such that a spin polarized current is generated in a chaotic quantum dot in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we go beyond the adiabatic regime and examine the frequency dependence of the pumped spin current . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that a pure spin current can be achieved by varying the pumping frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the system we investigate is a spin - valve which consists of a non - magnetic scattering region connected by two ferromagnetic electrodes to the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment @xmath0 of the left electrode is pointing to the @xmath1-direction , the electric current is flowing in the @xmath2-direction , while the moment of the right electrode is at an angle @xmath3 to the @xmath1-axis in the @xmath4 plane . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity of discussion , we assume that the value of molecular field @xmath5 is the same for the two electrodes , thus a standard spin - valve effect is obtained@xcite by varying the angle @xmath3 . essentially , @xmath5 mimics the difference of density of states ( dos ) between spin - up and down electrons@xcite in the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the pumped current for this system can be calculated at finite frequency and up to the second order in pumping amplitude using the perturbation theory based on nonequilibrium green s functions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pumped particle current due to spin component @xmath6 through lead @xmath7 is found to be ( @xmath8)@xcite @xmath9 { \\bf g}^a \\right]_{\\beta \\beta }   \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the pumping potential profile@xcite , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix representing the equilibrium retarded green s function @xmath15 with @xmath16 the hamiltonian in the absence of pumping potential . here @xmath17 is the self energy and @xmath18 $ ] is the linewidth function . </S>",
    "<S> the self - energies are given@xcite    @xmath19    with the rotational matrix @xmath20 for electrode @xmath7 defined as @xmath21 here angle @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the usual self energy@xcite . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will study two special cases : @xmath26 or @xmath27 for spin current . from eq.([eq8 ] ) , we observe that up to the second order in pumping amplitude , the particle can absorb or emit a photon during the pumping process . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution due to these two photon assisted processes have different sign and tend to cancel each other . as the result of this competition , the pumped particle current can reverse its direction upon varying system parameters .    the pumped charge current @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath29 and the pumped spin current @xmath30 is ( we have set @xmath8 ) @xmath31 now we examine the conservation law for pumped current . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath32 , the @xmath14 green s function @xmath33 and self energy are diagonal . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath34_{\\beta \\beta }   \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have moved @xmath35 to the beginning of the trace . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done only if the green s function and self energy are diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> using the fact that @xmath36 and changing variable from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in the second term of eq.([eq9 ] ) , it is straightforward to show the @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that both the pumped electric current and pumped spin current are conserved in this device .    </S>",
    "<S> now we use eqs.([eq8 ] ) , ( [ ele ] ) , and ( [ spin ] ) to calculate pumped electric current and spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the system we studied is a symmetric double @xmath40 barrier structure modeled by potential @xmath41 . for this system </S>",
    "<S> the green s function @xmath42 can be calculated exactly@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pumping potential is chosen to be sinusoidal @xmath43 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we will calculate the pumped electric and spin current from the left lead at zero temperature and set @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> a gate voltage @xmath47 is applied in the double barrier structure to control the resonant electron level . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the fermi level of the leads is in line with the resonant level at @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> finally the unit is set by @xmath49 . for the system of fe </S>",
    "<S> / ge / fe with @xmath50 , the energy unit is @xmath51 which corresponds to @xmath52 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the unit for pumped current is @xmath53a . </S>",
    "<S> the unit for spin current is @xmath54 .    in fig.1 , we show the pumped electric current ( solid line ) and spin current ( dotted line ) as a function pumping frequency when @xmath26 for fixed fermi energy and magnetization @xmath5 . as the frequency increases , the pumped electric current increases and reaches a maximum value at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> as the frequency increases further , the pumped electric current decrease and becomes negative at large frequency . in the presence of magnetic electrodes , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped electric current is spin polarized with non - zero spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the pumped spin current is similar to that of the pumped electric current . </S>",
    "<S> it is positive at small pumping frequency and becomes negative at larger frequencies . at @xmath56 ( thin vertical line in fig.1 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped electric current is zero and a pure spin current is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this is the following . during parametric pumping , </S>",
    "<S> the system pumps out spin - up and spin - down electrons . for electron with a given fermi energy , </S>",
    "<S> the potential of the ferromagnetic lead for spin - up electron is @xmath57 while for spin - down electron it is @xmath5 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped electric current for different spins can have different sign , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ spin - up electron pumps out from the right lead to the left whereas spin - down electron flows to the right lead during the pumping . </S>",
    "<S> this way a spin current is generated . </S>",
    "<S> at certain value of the frequency , a complete cancellation of electric current occurs and a pure spin current is delivered .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.2 we plot the pumped electric current and spin current versus pumping frequency for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the pumped electric current for @xmath26 has the same order of magnitude as that at @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the pumped spin current , however , is quite different from that at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it displays a linear dependency on the pumping frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency at which a pure spin current occurs is also different from the case when @xmath26 . comparing with the case of @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> the spin current reverses its direction when @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the pure spin current is a generic property and can occur at a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.1 , we see that at @xmath59 and @xmath56 the system pumps out pure spin current . as we vary @xmath5 , the frequency @xmath60 at which the pure spin current occurs also changes . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory or the `` phase diagram '' is depicted in fig.3 where pumping frequency versus magnetization of the leads for @xmath26 is shown ( solid line ) along with the magnitude of pumped spin current .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a non - adiabatic quantum spin pump which can generate a pure spin current with zero electric current during the parametric pumping . </S>",
    "<S> the device consists of a non - magnetic system connected by two ferromagnetic leads . since electrons with different spin experience different potential landscape , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding pumped current can be quite different . at certain condition , </S>",
    "<S> the pumped electric current can be zero while pure spin current is produced . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that this can be easily achieved by varying system parameters such as the pumping frequency . </S>"
