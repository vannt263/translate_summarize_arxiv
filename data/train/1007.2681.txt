    "more than 380 stars with planets have been discovered to date , half of which were detected in the past three years .",
    "most of the extrasolar planets have been discovered via radial - velocity measurements of the reflex motions of the planet - hosting star and such surveys are biased to detect preferentially the largest and most closely orbiting planets . within an ever increasing sample size , one statistically significant property has been confirmed for these objects : the average metallicity of the solar - like stars known to have giant planets ( i.e. those planets close to the mass of jupiter or larger ) is higher when compared to field f , g and k dwarfs not known to host giant planets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this difference is attributed to two possible scenarios : primordial enrichment and pollution . at present , the former seems to best account for the metal - rich nature of the planet hosting stars , since the probability of finding a planet is a steeply rising function of the stellar metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the pollution hypothesis can not be discarded , as contradictory conclusions have been found by several studies which attempted to unveil other chemical peculiarities in planet hosting stars ( for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the population of rather metal rich stars hosting jovian - mass planets , there is a growing number of known systems with considerably lower - mass planetary companions .",
    "the range of planetary masses now includes objects with minimum masses of only about @xmath1 , with many systems containing neptunian - mass  planets , with @xmath2 .",
    "it is of interest to investigate whether the trend for jovian - mass planets to have a metal - rich stellar parent continues towards systems with lower - mass planets that do not contain the large jovian - mass planets .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that stars which have as their most massive planets neptunian - mass objects may not be metal rich ; however , the number of such systems which have been studied is just a few .",
    "the list of stars with neptunian - mass planets continues to grow and these objects will help to probe the possibility of a stellar - metallicity planet - mass connection .",
    "the observed variety of exo - planetary masses and orbital separations , along with evidence of planetary migration and its possible influence on proto - planetary disk  stellar interactions suggests that it is of importance to determine chemical abundance distributions in different populations of exo - planet host stars .",
    "the search for subtle patterns in the abundances of stars with and without planets that may reveal details of planetary formation or planetary system architecture is based ideally on a homogeneous and self - consistent analysis .",
    "if all samples are observed with the same instrumental setup and analyzed with a consistent methodology , systematic effects are more likely to be avoided .",
    "this study sets forth a homogeneous determination of stellar parameters and metallicities for a large sample of stars with planets , including a few stars hosting only neptunian mass planets , as well as a control sample comprised of field stars not known to host giant planets .",
    " [ data ] describes the observational data , sample selection criteria , and data reduction .",
    "the determination of stellar parameters , effective temperatures , surface gravities and metallicities , including the adopted iron line list , are presented in  [ analysis ] . in  [ disc ] , results from this work are compared with those from the literature and discussed in light of various planet - metallicity correlations . included in this discussion",

    "the derivation of the elemental abundances other than fe will be treated in subsequent papers .",
    "* planet hosting stars * : the sample of main - sequence stars with planets analyzed in this study contains 117 targets .",
    "the target list was compiled using the extrasolar planet encyclopaedia and updated with newly discovered systems until august 2008 .",
    "we selected all planet hosting stars having @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the declination limit was imposed by object observability at la silla observatory in chile , and the limiting magnitude was set in order to keep exposure times needed to achieve the desired s / n relatively short .",
    "several stars in this sample have been previously analyzed in recent studies of planet hosting stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note that 16 planet hosting stars in this sample are not included in these previous abundance studies .    * control sample * : a control sample of main - sequence disk stars which are not known to host giant planets was selected from the list of nearby f , g and k stars in @xcite which has been targeted in the planet search programs conducted at the keck observatory , lick observatory and the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "that study identified 850 stars for which there are enough observations to securely detect the presence of companions with velocity amplitudes @xmath5 30 m @xmath6 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr . from the subsample of stars with non - detections of giant planets , we eliminated stars with [ m / h ] @xmath7 -1.0 ; @xmath8 sin @xmath9 10 km @xmath6 ( typical rotational velocities are much lower for solar - type stars ) and @xmath10 . in addition , any stars which were found subsequently to host giant planets ( the only case being hd 16417 ) were obviously removed from the list .",
    "binaries , as well as targets having one single spectrum analyzed were also excluded ( according to table 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "hd 36435 was added to the list as it was previously analyzed for @xmath11li ( @xcite ) .",
    "the final sample of comparison stars in this study has 145 targets .",
    "a list with all targets analyzed , planet hosting stars as well as control sample stars , is presented in table [ obslog ] .",
    "high - resolution spectra were obtained with the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ; @xcite ) attached to the mpg / eso-2.20 m telescope ( la silla , chile ) .",
    "the detector was a 2k x 4k eev ccd with 15 @xmath12 m pixels .",
    "this instrumental setup produces spectra with almost complete spectral coverage from 3,560 to 9,200   ( over 39 chelle orders ) and at a nominal resolution r @xmath13 48,000 .",
    "the observations were conducted during 6 observing runs between april 2007 and august 2008 .",
    "a solar spectrum of the afternoon sky ( t@xmath14= 2x120s ) was taken before each observing night .",
    "a detailed log of the observations , including @xmath15 magnitudes , observation dates , total integration times and the resulting s / n per resolution element , is found in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the feros data reduction system ( drs ) .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures .",
    "an average flat - field image was used in order to define the positions of the chelle orders .",
    "the background ( bias level and scattered light ) was subtracted from the images .",
    "the bias level was determined from the overscan region of the ccd and the scattered light was measured in the interorder space and in the region between the two fibers .",
    "the extraction of the chelle orders was done with a standard algorithm that also finds and removes cosmic rays .",
    "all extracted images were divided by the average flat - field in order to remove pixel - to - pixel variations and they were corrected for the blaze function .",
    "the flat - fielded spectra were wavelength calibrated using tharne and/or thar+ne calibration frames .",
    "the calibrated spectra were rebinned in constant steps of wavelength and a barycentric correction was applied .",
    "finally , the reduced spectra were corrected for radial velocity shifts by comparing the observed wavelengths of some isolated and moderately strong iron lines with their rest wavelenghts taken from vienna atomic line databasevald/ ] ( vald ; @xcite ) .",
    "the line lists for and were compiled from the line sample in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the initial line list contained over 100 iron lines but using both the solar flux atlas ( @xcite ) as well as the solar spectrum taken with feros on 20 august 2008 , and from results of test calculations with a variety of _",
    "gf_-values from the literature , we selected 27 and 12 suitable lines which were unblended and of intermediate strength ( equivalent widths less than 90 m , in order to limit the effects of damping on the abundance determination ) .",
    "the final line list adopted in this fe abundance analysis is presented in table [ linelist ] .",
    "the wavelengths and lower excitation potentials ( lep ) of the fe transitions were taken from vald .",
    "the _ gf_-values for transitions were taken from : @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the _ gf_-values from these studies were carefully compared in @xcite and found to be in excellent agreement .",
    "@xcite also argue that differences between the _ gf_-values of these three groups are comparable to random uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "corrections to the log _ gf _ scales from these different sources were therefore deemed not necessary in this study ; whenever a transition had more than one _ gf_-value available , an average value was adopted .",
    "the _ gf_-values for the lines in this study were taken from the critical analysis of @xcite .",
    "the code ares ( @xcite ) was used in order to measure equivalent widths ( ews ) of sample fe lines automatically .",
    "briefly , this program first fits a polynomial to the local continuum in a spectral region defined by the user .",
    "it then determines which lines inside the given interval can be fit by a gaussian profile .",
    "finally , it computes the equivalent width(s ) for the line(s ) of interest assuming a gaussian profile .",
    "more details about the ares code can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths measured for all program stars can be found in @xcite .",
    "possible systematic effects in the automatic ares equivalent width measurements were investigated here .",
    "we measured ( using the ` splot ` task of iraf ) equivalent widths of 75 lines and 22 lines in 6 stars which were selected to bracket the range in effective temperature , metallicity and spectrum quality ( signal - to - noise ratio ) of our sample as well as the sun . a comparison between manual and automatic equivalent width measurements for 638 lines is shown in figure [ ews ] . the mean difference between the two sets of equivalent widths is @xmath16ew@xmath17ew@xmath18 m .",
    "also , the following linear fit is obtained : ew@xmath19ew@xmath20 .",
    "the correlation coefficient and the standard deviation are r @xmath21 0.99627 and @xmath22 m , respectively .",
    "the exercise above indicates that the equivalent widths which were measured automatically using the ares code are consistent with our measurements , although there is a slight trend of ares equivalent widths being marginally smaller than the ones measured manually in this study .",
    "this result is in line with what was found in @xcite .",
    "although we find an overall good agreement between manual and automatic equivalent widths , it is important to carefully check the results because ares does not make quality assessments of the measurements it outputs .",
    "for instance , in the tests decribed above we note that there were 10 lines with obviously erroneous equivalent width measurements , which were discarded . in this study",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath02 m  as the typical uncertainty in the equivalent width measurements .",
    "differences in equivalent widths of @xmath23 2 m  are about what is expected given the resolution , sampling , and s / n of the spectra and no significant systematic effects are found between ares and manual measurements",
    ".      stellar parameters ( t@xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) were derived homogeneously and following standard spectroscopic methods which are based on requirements of excitation and ionization equilibria .",

    "waals constants were multiplied by an enhancement factor of 2.0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model atmospheres in this study were interpolated from the odfnew grid of atlas9 models ( @xcite ) .",
    "effective temperatures and microturbulent velocities were iterated until the slopes of a ( ) + 12 ] _ versus _ excitation potential , @xmath27 , and a ( ) _ versus _ reduced equivalent width,@xmath28 , were respectively zero ( excitation equilibrium ) .",
    "only lines with @xmath29 ( this limit was changed to larger values for cooler stars ) were used in the first iteration , in order to decouple the t@xmath24 and @xmath26 determinations .",
    "surface gravities were iterated until and returned the same mean abundances ( ionization equilibrium ) . at the end of the iterative process , a consistent set of values of t@xmath24 ,",
    "log g and microturbulent velocity as well as the mean (= ) abundance is obtained for the star .",
    "this procedure was adopted for all stars in our sample except for seven targets which had lower metallicities and solar temperatures ( namely hd 6434 , hd 51929 , hd 80913 , hd 114762 , hd 153075 , hd 155918 and hd 199288 ) . in these cases ,",

    "accretion of only a few earth masses of solid material would increase the surface value of [ fe / h ] by @xmath0 + 0.3 dex in a solar - metallicity star with t@xmath69 = 6400 k ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "no such trend is seen in figure [ feh_teff ] , suggesting that accretion of more than a few earth masses of solid material is either rare , or such accreted material sinks rapidly out of the outer convection zone .",
    "in addition to the comparison carried out above between [ fe / h ] and t@xmath69 , it is also instructive to do a similar comparison with stellar mass ( in this case using the evolutionary track masses ) ; this comparison is shown in figure [ feh_avg_mtrack_bin ] , again , where stars without planets are plotted in the upper panel and stars with planets in the lower panel .",
    "the samples have been binned in mass intervals of 0.25 m@xmath33 , as represented by the error bars in the abscissa .",
    "the values of [ fe / h ] plotted represent the mean value within that mass interval , with the error bars showing the standard deviations of [ fe / h ] at that mass . in both samples , the values of [ fe / h ] increase with increasing stellar mass .",
    "such an increase was noted in the review by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his figure 1 ) using the abundance results from @xcite .",
    "a signature of solid - body accretion polluting the stellar convective envelopes would be an upturn in [ fe / h ] with increasing stellar mass , since the convective envelope mass is a rapidly decreasing function of increasing stellar mass . at first glance",
    ", the increase in [ fe / h ] with mass found here ( and noted by @xcite based on the @xcite results ) might suggest that solid - body accretion has taken place .",
    "two effects , however , indicate that this has not affected the overall metallicities .",
    "first , the slopes of @xmath72[fe / h]/@xmath72 m are identical in both the stars with planets and stars without planets .",
    "this slope is very roughly + 0.7 dex / m@xmath33 and is similar to the slope that would be deduced from figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the fact that all of the various samples of stars , with and without giant planets , exhibit similar behavior in metallicity with mass argues that pollution has not selectively altered the values of [ fe / h ] in a significant way for the stars with giant planets .",
    "the second point to note is that a positive slope of [ fe / h ] with stellar mass would result from an age - metallicity relation .",
    "since more massive stars have shorter main - sequence lifetimes , they would be biased towards higher values of [ fe / h ] , while lower - mass stars would be a mixture of old and young stars , which would shift the overall distribution to lower average values of [ fe / h ] .    in summary ,",
    "comparisons among iron abundances with effective temperatures and stellar masses in both samples of stars ( with and without large planets , respectively ) reveal that accretion of solid - body material does not affect significantly ( @xmath00.1 - 0.2 dex ) the overall bulk metallicity in either sample .",
    "this does not rule out smaller amounts of accretion , which might affect abundance ratios between certain types of elements ( such as volatile versus refractory species , as suggested by @xcite ; see @xcite for an alternative interpretation ) .",
    "this question will be addressed in a later paper using the spectra from this dataset and analyzing a broad range of elements .      as discussed in section [ lit ]",
    "the metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) derived here are generally consistent ( within the expected errors ) with metallicities found in other studies of planet hosting stars in the literature . as the present study relies on a homogeneous and self - consistent analysis of a sample of 262 stars , having comparable numbers of planet hosting and comparison disk stars , it is possible to quantify differences in the metallicity distributions in these two populations .",
    "figure [ feh_hist ] shows the metallicity distributions for stars with planets ( solid line histogram ) and comparison stars ( dashed line histogram ) .",
    "there is an offset in the peak metallicity of the two histograms in the figure .",
    "the peak of the distrbution for stars with planets is located in the bin centered at [ fe / h ] = + 0.20 dex and the average metallicity of this sample is @xmath73\\rangle$ ] = + 0.11 dex . for the comparison stars ,",
    "the peak is on the bin centered at [ fe / h ] = + 0.10 dex and the average metallicity in this case is lower : @xmath73\\rangle = -0.04 $ ] dex .",
    "thus , there is an offset of 0.15 dex between the mean metallicities of the two samples .    when comparing properties , such as metallicity , between samples of planet hosting stars and those without giant planets , it is worth noting some selection biases inherent in these samples .",
    "as summarized by @xcite , doppler surveys avoid young , chromospherically active stars ( which also typically are fast rotators ) and contain only small numbers of metal poor stars ( with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -0.5 dex ) because these objects are rare in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in particular , our control sample of disk stars would also suffer from such biases since it was selected in order to search for the presence of planets .",
    "as this offset between the peak values of the two histograms is of the order of , or just slightly higher than , the expected uncertainties in the derived iron abundances themselves , it is useful to perform a robust statistical test in order to further investigate whether the metallicity offset is meaningful . in this sense",
    ", we conducted a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test and found a probability @xmath74 that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this low probability confirms the results previously found in the literature that the population of stars hosting giant planets is more metal - rich than the population of stars not known to harbour such planets .",
    "if a volume limited sample with a radius of 18 pc is defined here for comparison , the mean metallicity for the control sample disk stars ( n=46 ) is now -0.11 dex and the offset relative to planet - hosting stars becomes 0.22 dex , similar to the one found by @xcite based on a much larger sample .",
    "the average metallicity found for the volume - limited sample in this study is also consistent with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former study uses a comparison sample of 94 stars within 20 pc of the sun and finds @xmath73\\rangle   = -0.11 $ ] dex .",
    "the latter work extends the comparison sample to 385 stars and the enclosed radius to 56 pc and finds @xmath73\\rangle = -0.12 $ ] dex .    the results from sections [ teff_feh_accret ] and [ mass_feh ] indicate that solid body accretion has probably not altered surface values of [ fe / h ] at the level of the offset in metallicity ; the difference in [ fe / h ] between the two samples suggests that intrinsic metallicity influences giant planet formation and migration .      the conclusions from the previous section favor the premise that metallicity plays a role in influencing the formation of giant planets , i.e. , planets with roughly the mass of jupiter .",
    "within this model it is worthwhile exploring whether stellar metallicity also plays a role in the mass distribution of planetary systems .",
    "such a comparison begins to probe how the underlying planetary system architecture might depend on metallicity . in this section , the metallicities of stars harboring only lower mass planets , i.e. those having neptunian masses ,",
    "are compared to systems containing the larger jovian mass planets .",
    "@xcite presented preliminary results in which they found possible metallicity differences between stars hosting jovian mass planets compared to those hosting neptunian - mass planets ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the differences between the two metallicity distributions defined respectively by stars with jovian - mass planets as opposed to neptunian - mass planets indicated that these groups are not likely to belong to the same populations of stars .",
    "this conclusion , however , was based on a comparison of 63 jovian hosting stars with a sample of 11 neptunian hosting stars ( those which contained at least one neptune mass planet ) .",
    "five of these 11 stars were m dwarfs and their metallicities were taken from the literature , while three were fg dwarfs analyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* harps gto ) .",
    "the difference between the two metallicitiy distributions was a small mean offset of about 0.1 dex , with the neptune hosting stars having a slightly lower mean metallicity .    because m dwarfs are more difficult to analyze spectroscopically , due to considerable line blending and blanketing from molecules , it is necessary to consider abundance uncertainties and systematics when using results from these complex stellar spectra .",
    "recent abundance analyses of m dwarfs include @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the studies by @xcite and @xcite point , for instance , to potentially large uncertainties in derived m dwarf abundances .",
    "for example , @xcite find an average offset of @xmath0 0.30 dex in [ fe / h ] when their abundances are compared to the same m dwarfs from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table [ nept_table ] ) .",
    "such discrepancies suggest that , until results for the cooler m dwarfs are on firmer ground , it is prudent to investigate the effects of both including m dwarf metallicities in such comparisons , as well as excluding them .    the sample studied here contains 9 systems which host at least one neptunian mass planet , none of which are m dwarfs .",
    "this is the largest sample of stars hosting neptunian size planets analyzed homogeneously for metallicities to date and this subsample can be directly compared to the jupiter - like planet hosting stellar sample .",
    "the strength of such a comparison rests upon the fact that all stars have been analyzed homogeneously and are within a similar range of stellar parameters , so that systematic errors are not likely to produce spurious differences in the metallicity distributions .",
    "the weakness is that the sample of neptune - mass hosts has only a small number of stars .",
    "figure [ nept_hist ] ( top panel ) shows histograms representing metallicity distributions of two samples : those stars hosting at least one jupiter - mass planet ( n=112 ; black solid line ) and stars hosting only neptune - mass planets ( n=5 ; represented by the dashed red line ) . there is a hint that stars with only neptunian planets tend to be more metal poor compared to jovian - planet hosting stars .",
    "the average metallicity of the neptunian hosts is -0.08 dex , while the jupiter host metallicity distribution has an average of + 0.12 dex .",
    "if a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test is performed , we find a probability of 8% that the stars in the two samples belong to the same metallicity population ( which agrees with @xcite ) . this is a tantalizing result that suggests that metallicity may play a role not just in the formation of giant planets , but may also influence the distribution of planetary masses within exo - solar systems .",
    "this important question needs to be answered more definitively , but this will require larger samples .    in order to extend the sample of stars with neptunian mass planets ( shown in the top panel of figure [ nept_hist ] ) in this discussion , a list of stars with at least one neptunian planet was compiled from the extrasolar planet encyclopaedia and is presented in table [ nept_table ] along with the metallicity results from the different studies in the literature . in a similar analysis as was done for the sample of stars studied here ( discussed above ) , two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov tests were done now with the inclusion of the literature sample using different permutations . the results from these tests are discussed below .",

    "the metallicity comparison can also be carried out by dividing the sample into stars with at least one neptunian - mass planet , regardless of whether there is also a jovian mass planet in the system , and those systems with jovian mass planets but no neptunian - mass planets .",
    "the average metallicity of the sample of stars which host at least one neptunian planet ( n=9 ) is + 0.09 dex , close to the value derived for stars hosting at least one jupiter - mass planet ( + 0.12 dex ; n=112 ) .",
    "a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test reveals that the probability that these two samples belong to the same parent population is 91% .",
    "this comparison strengthens the idea that metallicity played a role in setting the mass of the most massive planet in a system .",
    "all of these various comparisons taken together suggest that lower values of [ fe / h ] tend to produce lower - masses of the most massive planet within a planetary system .",
    "such conclusions , however , should be viewed with caution since the number of stars harboring neptune - size planets analyzed to date is still rather small , but in line with what would be expected from models of planet formation via core accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also review by @xcite ) .",
    "we have determined stellar parameters for 117 main - sequence stars with planets discovered via radial velocity surveys and 145 comparison stars which have been found to exhibit nearly constant radial velocities and are not likely to host large , closely orbiting planets .",

    "gf_-values of fe lines and automatically measured equivalent widths , after critical evaluations of their quality .",
    "the values of effective temperature , surface gravity ( as @xmath25 ) , microturbulent velocities , and iron abundances are in general good agreement with most of the values presented in a number of literature studies , but problems with a few individual stars may remain .",
    "correlations between [ fe / h ] and t@xmath69 in members of either sample are not found , which places stringent limits on the possible accretion of solid material ( of less than a few earth masses ) onto the surfaces of these stars .",
    "a trend of increasing [ fe / h ] with increasing stellar mass is found in both samples of stars , with the slope of @xmath72[fe / h]/@xmath72 m being the same for stars with giant planets and control sample stars .",
    "the same value of @xmath72[fe / h]/@xmath72 m for both samples rules out solid - body accretion , which leaves the underlying disk age - metallicity relation as the likely cause of the positive correlation of [ fe / h ] with mass .",
    "it should be noted that the samples analyzed here were not selected based on any rigourous criteria , other than being segregated based on the presence of giant planets in one sample and the probable absence of such planets in the other .",
    "the list of stars without planets preferentially included metal - rich stars , while some stars with planets were discovered by surveys that were based on high - metallicity as a criterion .",
    "a comparison of iron abundances between the stars with planets with the results from the control sample of disk stars confirms the results obtained by previous studies showing that planet - hosting stars exhibit larger metallicities than stars not harboring planets ; the difference found in this sample is that stars with planets are shifted by + 0.15 dex in [ fe / h ] when compared to the stars without planets .",
    "the sample of stars with planets discussed here contains 9 stars which host at least one neptunian - mass planet ; of these 9 systems , 4 also contain a jovian - mass planet , while 5 contain only neptunian - sized planets and no jovian - mass closely orbiting planets .",
    "a statistical test of the iron abundances indicates that there is probably a real difference between the metallicity distributions of stars which contain _ only _ smaller neptunian - sized planets in comparison with stars hosting the larger jovian - mass planets ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although it should be recognized that the sample sizes are still small , there seems to be early indications that metallicity plays an important role in setting the mass of the most massive planet .",
    "it is also important to note that such a conclusion obtained here is based on stars which have all been analyzed homogeneously and which also have similar stellar parameters , therefore avoiding the large uncertainties still hampering the analyses and derived metallicities for the cooler m dwarfs .",

    "<S> the metal content of planet hosting stars is an important ingredient which may affect the formation and evolution of planetary systems . </S>",

    "<S> this work presents the homogeneous derivation of such parameters for a large sample of stars hosting planets ( n=117 ) , as well as a control sample of disk stars not known to harbor giant , closely orbiting planets ( n=145 ) . </S>",
    "<S> stellar parameters and iron abundances are derived from an automated analysis technique developed for this work . as previously found in the literature , </S>",
    "<S> the results in this study indicate that the metallicity distribution of planet hosting stars is more metal - rich by @xmath00.15 dex when compared to the control sample stars . </S>",
    "<S> a segregation of the sample according to planet mass indicates that the metallicity distribution of stars hosting only neptunian - mass planets ( with no jovian - mass planets ) tends to be more metal - poor in comparison with that obtained for stars hosting a closely orbiting jovian planet . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of this difference in metallicity arises from a homogeneous analysis of samples of fgk dwarfs which do not include the cooler and more problematic m dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this result would indicate that there is a possible link between planet mass and metallicity such that metallicity plays a role in setting the mass of the most massive planet . </S>",
    "<S> further confirmation , however , must await larger samples . </S>"
