    "in the stationary solution for spherically symmetric winds ( chevalier and clegg 1985 ; hereafter referred to as cc85 ) as well as in the former approach of holzer and axford ( 1970 ) and in the more recent numerical calculations of cant et al .",

    "( 2003 , hereafter referred to as paper i ) for winds driven by powerful and compact stellar clusters , and by wang ( 1995 ) for gas outflows from galaxies .",
    "winds driven by compact star clusters establish a temperature distribution radically different from that predicted by the adiabatic solution , bringing the x - ray emitting boundary much closer to the star cluster surface .",
    "however , in none of the above studies , the effects of radiative cooling within the star forming volume itself were taken into consideration .    here",
    "we present a self - consistent semi - analytical model of stationary winds driven by massive stellar clusters taking full account of radiative cooling ( see sections 2 and 3 ) .",
    "we first discuss how to find proper wind central values and then use them to integrate numerically the basic equations .",
    "we also indicate the threshold value of the energy deposition rate above which a stationary solution is inhibited . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "the three regimes found when radiative cooling is considered : the quasi - adiabatic , the strongly radiative wind and the inhibited stationary wind , are then compared to well observed examples .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "following cc85 , cant et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and raga et al . ( 2001 ) , we assume that within a star cluster , within the volume of radius @xmath1 , the matter ejected by stellar winds and supernova explosions is fully thermalized via random interactions .",
    "this generates the large central overpressure that continuously accelerates the ejected gas and eventually blows it out of the star cluster volume .",
    "there are three star cluster parameters which together define the hydrodynamical properties of the resultant wind outflow ( or the run of density , temperature and expansion velocity , which asymptotically approach @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the three parameters are : the total energy ( @xmath5 ) and mass ( @xmath6 ) deposition rates and the actual size of the volume that encloses the star cluster ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the total mass and energy deposition rates also define the wind terminal velocity @xmath7 .",
    "in the adiabatic case there is an analytic solution and thus one can derive the wind central density , pressure and temperature ( see cant et al . , 2000 ) if the above parameters are known : @xmath8 \\label{eq.0b }        & & \\hspace{-1.0 cm } p_{c } = \\frac{\\gamma - 1}{2 \\gamma } \\frac{{\\dot m}_{sc } v_{\\infty a } }          { 4 \\pi b r_{sc}^2 } ,         \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\label{eq.0c }        & & \\hspace{-1.0 cm } t_c = \\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma } \\frac{\\mu}{k } \\frac{q_e}{q_m } ,   \\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the energy and mass deposition rates per unit volume ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath15 is the mean mass per particle and @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant . using these initial values one can solve the stationary wind equations numerically and reproduce the analytic solution throughout the space volume .",

    "( 2001 ) .    within the central volume , temperature and density present almost homogeneous values , whereas the expansion velocity grows almost linearly from 0 km s@xmath20 at the center , to the sound speed at the cluster radius , @xmath21 .",
    "there is then a rapid evolution as matter streams away from the star cluster .",
    "the flow accelerates rapidly when approaching the sonic point and the wind temperature and density begin to deviate from their central quasi - homogeneous distributions . at large radius",
    "the resultant wind parameters rapidly approach their asymptotic values ( see cc85 and paper i ) .",
    "due to the highly nonlinear character of the cooling function , the analytic approach is not valid in the general case that includes radiative cooling , and thus one needs to perform a numerical integration .",

    "it is easy to prove that the derivative of the expansion velocity is positive throughout the space volume , only if the sonic point is at the star cluster surface . indeed ,",
    "if the expansion velocity becomes supersonic at @xmath32 , the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq.2a ] ) and @xmath33 become negative inside the star cluster volume . on the other hand ,",
    "if the expansion velocity remains subsonic at @xmath34 , the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq.3a ] ) and the derivative of the expansion velocity , become negative outside the star forming region .",
    "the above implies that a stationary wind solution , which assumes a continuous gas acceleration , exists only if the outflow crosses the star cluster surface at the local sound speed ( @xmath35 at @xmath21 ) .",
    "this conclusion , illustrated in figure 1 does nt depend on the wind thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is valid both for the adiabatic ( cc85 and cant et al .",
    "2000 ) and for the radiative solution .",
    "there are three possible types of integral curve ( figure 1 ) corresponding to different possible positions of the sonic point with respect to the star cluster surface .",
    "1 ) the stationary wind solution ( solid line , @xmath36 ) . in this case the thermal pressure decreases continually outside the star cluster surface , approaching a negligible value at large radii .",
    "2 ) the breeze solution ( dashed line , @xmath37 ) . in this case",
    "the central temperature t@xmath38 is smaller than in the first case , which shifts the sonic point outside the cluster .",
    "this branch of solutions requires of a finite confining pressure and leads to zero velocity at infinity , in agreement with parker s ( 1958 ) conclusion .",
    "3 ) the unphysical double valued solution ( dotted line , @xmath39 ) . in this case",
    "t@xmath38 is larger than in the stationary wind case .",
    "the thermal pressure goes to zero when the expansion velocity approaches the wind terminal speed .    the appropriate solution is selected by the central conditions . in order to obtain a stationary free wind solution , one has to find the wind central density and central temperature which accommodate the sonic point at the star cluster surface ( @xmath35 at @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is the key point that allows for the definition of the central ( @xmath18 = 0 ) wind parameters and for the numerical solution of equations ( [ eq.2a]-[eq.3c ] ) .",
    "the wind central temperature @xmath40 and central atomic number density @xmath41 are not independent in the radiative case .",
    "they are related by the equation @xmath42 this results from comparing the derivative of the expansion velocity at the star cluster center , using equation ( [ eq.2c ] ) , with equation ( [ eq.2a ] ) .",
    "note that in the absence of radiative cooling , when @xmath43 equation ( [ eq.4 ] ) is transformed into the adiabatic relation ( [ eq.0c ] ) .",
    "thus , the wind parameters at the star cluster center can be found by iteration of the central temperature until the sonic point takes its proper position at the selected star cluster surface .",
    "as in the adiabatic case @xmath44 and @xmath40 are independent , one can always find the central pressure that accommodates the sonic point at the star cluster surface ( see equations [ eq.0a ] and [ eq.0c ] ) : @xmath45 however this is not the case if radiative cooling is taken into account .",
    "in this case the central density and the central pressure go to zero when the central temperature approaches its maximum value @xmath46 ( see equation [ eq.4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath47 increases for smaller values of the central temperature .",
    "however , it can not exceed a maximum value ( see equation [ eq.4 ] and figure 2a ) , bound by the gas radiative cooling . at this critical stage",
    "the fraction of energy radiated away at the cluster center per unit time , @xmath48 , reaches @xmath49 of the injected energy ( see figure 2c ) .",
    "if the central temperature becomes even smaller , there is no density enhancement able to compensate the fall in pressure promoted by radiative cooling .",
    "consequently , the central pressure can not promote an effective outward acceleration .",
    "therefore in the radiative case , the sonic radius ( @xmath50 ) can not be arbitrarily large and has a maximum value for any given set of star cluster parameters .",
    "figure 2b shows how @xmath50 depends on the central temperature , for particular values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for the largest central temperature",
    ", the resultant central pressure acquires its lowest value ( see figure 2a ) and the sonic point lies very close to the star cluster center .",
    "smaller values of @xmath40 lead to a larger @xmath47 ( figure 2a ) and consequently to larger @xmath50 values .",
    "@xmath50 reaches its maximum possible value when the central pressure approaches also its maximum ( compare figures 2a and 2b ) as expected in the quasi - adiabatic regime ( see equation [ eq.5 ] ) .    in the radiative stationary solution , although the sonic point may approach its maximum possible value , radiative losses of energy would represent only a moderate fraction of the energy input rate . in these cases , cooling would drastically modify the wind temperature distribution outside the star forming region ( see paper i and discussion below ) .",
    "when the rate of energy radiated away at the star cluster center exceeds @xmath51% of the energy deposition rate , the stationary solution is inhibited .",
    "this conclusion is stressed in figure 3 , which displays the critical energy deposition rate for different values of @xmath52 .    moving from right to left along the horizontal line",
    "is equivalent to considering progressively more compact clusters , all with the same energy and mass deposition rates ( @xmath53 erg s@xmath54 yr@xmath20 ) . for large star clusters the maximum allowed sonic radius @xmath50",
    "exceeds the star cluster radius @xmath1 , however one can accommodate the sonic point at the star cluster surface once a proper central temperature is selected and obtain a stationary wind solution .",
    "however , if the considered star cluster is smaller than the critical value ( @xmath55  pc for the example shown in figure 3 ) , the maximum allowed sonic point radius moves inside the star cluster and the stationary wind solution vanishes .",
    "the same is true if one moves along the vertical line in figure 3 , from low to high energy input rates . in this case one",
    "is selecting progressively more energetic star clusters within the same volume , until the sonic point ends up inside the star cluster ( in our example at @xmath56  erg s@xmath20 ) and the stationary wind solution vanishes .",
    "once the proper initial conditions are selected , one can solve the main equations ( [ eq.2a]-[eq.3c ] ) numerically and obtain the wind temperature and density distributions .",
    "we have compared for example our results with stevens & hartwell ( 2003 ) standard model ( @xmath57 pc , @xmath58 yr@xmath20 , @xmath59 km s@xmath20 ) . in this case",
    "the stationary wind evolves in the quasi - adiabatic regime and we found an excellent agreement with stevens & hartwell central values and x - ray luminosity .",
    "our model predicts @xmath60k , @xmath61 @xmath62 and the x - ray flux between 0.3 and 8.0  kev from the central 1pc volume @xmath63erg s@xmath20 .",
    "free winds present a four zone structure ( silich et al . 2003 ) : a star cluster region filled with a hot x - ray plasma , an adjacent x - ray halo with a decreasing temperature distribution , the line cooling zone and a region of recombined gas , exposed to the uv and soft x - ray radiation from the inner zones and to the uv photons emitted by the star cluster itself .",
    "figure 4 presents the free wind temperature distribution for three sscs , all with the same @xmath1 = 10 pc radius and the same ratio @xmath64 km s@xmath20 , but different energy and mass deposition rates .",
    "the lowest energy case ( solid line ) lies well into the adiabatic regime . in the other two cases however , the radiative cooling clearly modifies the internal wind structure bringing the boundary of the x - ray zone and the photoionized envelope closer to the star cluster surface . in the most energetic case shown in figure 4 , that with @xmath65 erg s@xmath20 star cluster ( dashed line ) , the outer boundary of the x - ray zone ( @xmath66 k ) is about a factor of 1.5 smaller than in the adiabatic case .",
    "furthermore , the dimension ( @xmath67 ) at which the gas attains a temperature @xmath68 k lies about 10 times closer to the star cluster center than in the adiabatic case .",
    "consequently , the maximum density of the emission line envelope is @xmath69 times larger and the emission measure is @xmath70 times larger than in the adiabatic case .",
    "the line cooling zone and the photoionized envelope may be observed as a broad ( @xmath71 km s@xmath20 ) emission line component perhaps of low intensity if compared to the narrow line caused by the central hii region .",
    "it is worth noticing that the luminosity of the central hii region decays rapidly after @xmath72myr , when the most massive stars in a coeval cluster begin to move away from the main sequence , whereas the broad component conserves its luminosity being ionized by the soft x - ray radiation and therefore should be easier to detect in old ( @xmath73 yr ) objects .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the star cluster wind is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the atomic density distribution , @xmath76 is the x - ray cut - off radius where the wind temperature drops below @xmath77k , and @xmath78 is the x - ray emissivity derived by raymond & smith ( 1977 ) in their hot - plasma code ( see strickland & stevens 2000 ) .",
    "the arches cluster is the densest and the most compact star cluster known in the local group .",
    "it is located within @xmath79pc volume at @xmath80 pc from the milky way center and contains @xmath81 stars with masses in excess of 20(serabyn et al .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated within a range 2 - 4.5 myr and the mass is @xmath68 for an imf with @xmath82 and lower and upper mass cutoffs of 1and 100 , respectively .",
    "two sets of calculations for the arches cluster wind have been presented by raga et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and stevens & hartwell ( 2003 ) .",
    "they differ somewhat on the assumed input parameters .",

    "<S> here we present a self - consistent stationary solution for spherically symmetric winds driven by massive star clusters under the impact of radiative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that cooling may modify drastically the distribution of temperature if the rate of injected energy approaches a critical value . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that the stationary wind solution does not exist whenever the energy radiated away at the star cluster center exceeds @xmath0 of the energy deposition rate . </S>",
    "<S> finally we thoroughly discuss the expected appearance of super - star cluster winds in the x - ray and visible line regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the three solutions here found : the quasi - adiabatic , the strongly radiative wind and the inhibited stationary solution , are then compared to the winds from arches cluster , ngc 4303 central cluster and to the supernebula in ngc 5253 . </S>"
