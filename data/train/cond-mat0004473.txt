    "simple models have played an important role in the development of liquid state theory , both as approximations and as useful reference systems in perturbation schemes . the simplest model with a repulsive hard core and an attractive well is the square - well ( sw ) fluid .",
    "the sw interaction potential is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the diameter of the hard core , @xmath21 is the well depth , and @xmath22 is the well width .",
    "the equilibrium properties of the fluid depend on the values of three dimensionless parameters : the fraction of volume occupied by the spheres @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being the number density ) , the reduced temperature @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the temperature and @xmath27 being the boltzmann constant ) , and the width parameter @xmath28 . these properties can be derived from a more fundamental quantity , the so - called radial distribution function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is the probability that the centers of two spherical atoms in the liquid are separated by a distance between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the volume of the system . in the absence of particle interactions ( ideal gases )",
    "there is no structure in the fluid and @xmath33 .",
    "this is also true for any realistic potential in the limit @xmath34 as we must have @xmath35 in that limit .",
    "it is also evident that the centers of two particles in the sw fluid can not be nearer than @xmath20 due to the hard core , so @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "+ many closed integral equations have been proposed for this function ( ybg , hnc , percus - yevick ,  ) , but the most popular is , perhaps , the percus - yevick ( py ) equation . in the search for these approximations",
    "it has been found useful to define an auxiliary function , the direct correlation function @xmath38 , through the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) relationship @xmath39 where @xmath40 . in this equation and the following ones we are assuming that the interaction potential is spherically symmetric and the structure functions , consequently , depends only on the distance between the particle centers .",
    "the physical meaning of the direct correlation function is clear ; it accounts only for the correlation effects arising from a direct interaction between the particles in the fluid .",
    "nevertheless , the total correlation function , @xmath41 , comprises also the correlations propagated by intermediate particles .",
    "the direct correlation function is expressed in terms of the so - called bridge functionals , which constitute an infinite sum of diagrams @xcite .",
    "integral equations are obtained by closing the oz relation with an approximation for @xmath38 based upon a sum of some set of these diagrams . by choosing an appropiate set of diagrams , percus and",

    "+ nevertheless , neither the py equation nor any other integral equation for fluids has ever been analytically solved for the sw interaction . in 1977 ,",

    ", nezbeda @xcite proposed a polynomial approximate solution for @xmath5 valid in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "this solution was based on the continuity of the first and the second derivatives of @xmath5 at @xmath14 .",
    "more recently , yuste and santos@xcite derived a simple approximate expression for the laplace transform of @xmath55 for the sw fluid .",
    "this derivation is based upon simple physical requirements ( finiteness of the radial distribution function at @xmath56 and finite isothermal compressibility ) and the continuity of @xmath5 at @xmath57 .",

    "the radial distribution function is then divided in analytic pieces @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the py equation ( [ pymty ] ) is written as a system of non - linear integral equations for them . in these equations the heaviside step function that enters in eq .",

    "if @xmath28 is an integer we have discontinuities only at @xmath138 , the `` resonance '' condition is fulfilled and the order of continuity grows as @xmath30 for large @xmath30 . if @xmath28 is not an integer we must expect the appearance of discontinuities at those points which can be expressed as a linear combination of the fundamental scale lengths @xmath20 ( the hard core diameter ) and @xmath170 ( the sw width ) , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are integers . if @xmath28 is a rational number there is some point that can be obtained by using two different pairs of integers @xmath174 and the location of the discontinuity points repeats periodically after that .",
    "that is not the case for irrational values of @xmath28 . a direct consequence of the choice of a width well @xmath170 incommensurate with the hard core diameter",
    "@xmath20 is that the order of continuity at @xmath138 will possibly coincide with the corresponding to the hs fluid because the two discontinuities of the interaction potential do not interfere in this case . in the cases we have discussed ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 )",
    "there is still some kind of `` resonance '' and this gives rise to an order of continuity lower in two units to that of the hs fluid at @xmath175 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , the conjecture expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ 8a])([8e ] ) for @xmath157 is sufficient for the purpose of the search of approximate structure functions as only this interval is considered physically meaningful in the applications of the model to simple fluids or colloids .",
    "we must also emphasize that these results have been derived in the context of the py equation but , referring only to the key features of the structure functions , it is possible that they are more general .",
    "an analysis of other integral equations for fluids and the mayer diagrams not taking into account by them would be necessary in order to clarify this point . +",
    "this work was already started in the early days of the theory of liquids .",
    "percus showed @xcite , in the context of the py equation for hard spheres , that analytic breakings on the structure functions should appear whenever distances between particle centers along a chain are modified so to accommodate a new particle .",
    "this result explains the discontinuites on the cavity function derivatives at @xmath14 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ,  that are listed in the equations ( [ id])([ie ] ) .",
    "a combination of formal and heuristic geometric arguments were used later by stillinger @xcite in order to identify the diagrams which cause discontinuities in the derivatives of @xmath0 for hard spheres up to fourth order in the density .",
    "the most simple diagrams are the chains but we have also double chains and triply - connected diagrams that are not included in the py approximation . the topological change associated with the separation or the approaching of a given pair of spheres in the cluster corresponding to the diagram within a distance which avoids the contact of all the particles was found to be the origin of a singularity of the structure function . in that way , the lowest - order double chain gives rise to a singularity at @xmath178 and the lowest - order triply - connected cluster is responsible for a discontinuity at @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "careful monte carlo simulations carried out by seaton and glandt @xcite for the fluid of adhesive spheres have confirmed the existence of discontinuities of the radial distribution function at @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the latter is the most striking one and this is taking into account by the py solution because it is originated by the chain diagram with two bonds .",
    "the more complex spatial diagrams are responsible for the discontinuities at @xmath179 and @xmath180 which are not included in the py solution for the sticky hard sphere potential @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , these two are less prominent features of @xmath0 than the discontinuity at @xmath109 and the py solution gives a good overall agreement with monte carlo simulation results @xcite .",
    "stillinger @xcite has even suggested that the full set of singularities of @xmath0 for the hard sphere or hard disk case is dense throughout the entire range @xmath182 as a consequence of the formation or breaking of bonds on random packings when @xmath30 ( the distance between two given particles in the cluster ) is slightly varied . + analytical approximations proposed by different routes are equally interesting alternatives to the solution of the integral equations .",
    "these approximations are usually based on the imposition of continuity conditions at the hard core and the sw border .",
    "for example , the approximation of nezbeda @xcite for a very thin sw interaction is based upon the continuity of the first and the second derivatives of @xmath5 at @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "yuste and santos@xcite proposed an approximation on the basis of some physical conditions , among which the continuity of @xmath5 at @xmath183 .",
    "the latter authors are forced to fix one of the parameters of their model at its low density value in order to close the system of nonlinear equations that those parameters satisfy .",
    "the results derived in secs .",
    "[ sect_3 ] and [ sect_4 ] allow the imposition of continuity conditions on the first derivative of @xmath5 at @xmath57 and this would close the system of equations of yuste and santos s model in a more convincing way .",
    "similarly , nezbeda approximation could possibly be improved by imposing the continuity of the third derivative at @xmath14 .",
    "work along this line is currently in progress and will be published elsewhere .",

    "in this case the structure function @xmath75 is defined in the piecewise form given in ( [ psipl ] ) and the set of equations satisfied by the analytic functions @xmath99 , @xmath7 is obtained from ( [ 1a])([1d ] ) if the limit @xmath184 is taken ( which is equivalent to take @xmath48 or @xmath185 ) .",
