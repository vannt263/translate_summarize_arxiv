    "recent ground based observations ( @xcite ) , and with the hubble space telescope show that the spatial luminosity distributions of elliptical galaxies approach a power - law form @xmath0 at small radii , with @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these findings increase considerably the interest of theorists in the study of cuspy models .",
    "two important families of spherical dynamical models with a central divergent density that have been explored so far are the @xmath2 models and the so - called @xmath3-models .",
    "the dynamical properties of models whose surface brightness distribution follows the @xmath2-law , introduced by sersic ( 1968 ) as a natural generalization of the de vaucouleurs law ( @xcite ) , have been extensively studied ( @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , their deprojected density increases toward the center as @xmath4 for @xmath5 ; unfortunately two major problems afflict these models : their deprojected density can not be expressed analytically in terms of known functions , and no galaxies with @xmath6 can be accurately modeled in their central regions .",
    "the family of the @xmath3-models , in some way anticipated by hernquist ( @xcite , hereafter h90 ) , has been widely explored ( @xcite ) and it represents a generalization of the well known hernquist ( h90 ) and jaffe ( @xcite ) density distributions . as shown by the previous authors ,",
    "many of the dynamical properties of the @xmath3-models can be expressed analytically .",
    "in particular the hernquist model ( hereafter h model ) in projection well resembles the de vaucouleurs law , and an exhaustive analytical investigation of its properties is possible ( h90 ) .",
    "it is now accepted that a fraction of the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is made of a dark component , whose density distribution differs from that of the visible one .",
    "the shape of the dark matter distribution is not well constrained by observations , but numerical simulations of dissipationless collapses seem to favor a peaked profile , consistent with the scale - free nature of the gravitational field ( @xcite , and references therein ) . from these considerations",
    "it follows that the obvious generalization of the one - component spherical models ( the dynamicists zero - th order approximation of real galaxies ) is not only in the direction of the actively developed modeling of axisymmetric and triaxial systems [ see , e.g. , de zeeuw ( 1996 ) for a recent review ] but also in the study and construction of two - component analytical models , a field far less developed . from this point of view",
    "the zero - th order approximation of realistic galaxies is the construction of analytical spherically symmetric _ two - component _ galaxy models .",
    "when studying a dynamical model ( single or multi - component ) the fact that the jeans equations have a physically acceptable solution is not a sufficient criterion for the validity of the model : the essential requirement to be met by any acceptable dynamical model is the positivity of the df of each physically distinct component . a model satisfying this minimal requirement ( much weaker than the model stability ) is called a _ consistent _ model .",
    "two general strategies can be used to construct a consistent model or check whether a proposed model is consistent : the `` @xmath7 to @xmath8 '' and the `` @xmath8 to @xmath7 '' approaches ( @xcite , chap .",
    "4 , hereafter bt87 ) .",
    "an example of the first approach is the extensive survey of two  component , spherical , self  consistent galaxy models carried out by bertin and co - workers ( @xcite ) .",
    "they assume for the stellar and dark matter components two distribution functions of the @xmath9 form ( and so positive by choice ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that generally the spatial density is not expressible in terms of known functions , and so only numerical investigations are feasible .    in the second approach",
    "the density distribution is given , and assumptions on the model internal dynamic are made , making the comparison with the data simpler .",
    "but the difficulties inherent in the operation of recovering the df in many cases prevent a simple consistency analysis . in particular , in order to recover the df of spherical models with anisotropy two techniques have been developed from the original eddington ( 1916 ) method for isotropic systems : the osipkov - merritt technique ( @xcite , hereafter om ) , and the case discussed by cuddeford and louis ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "examples of _ numerical _ application of the om inversion to two - component spherical galaxies can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , hereafter cp92 ; @xcite ) . for axisymmetric systems",
    "recently a new inversion technique , less restrictive than the classical ones ( @xcite ) , has been found ( @xcite ) .",
    "if one is just interested in the consistency of a stellar system the previous methods give `` too much '' , i.e. , give the df . a simpler approach , at least for spherically symmetric multicomponent systems with om anisotropy  as the case discussed in this paper  is given by a method described by cp92 , that requires information only on the radial density profiles of each component .",
    "despite all these efforts , a small number of one - component systems in which both the spatial density and the df are analytically known is at our disposition , and in the more interesting case of two - component systems only the very remarkable axisymmetric binney - evans model is known ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore of particular interest the result here proved that also the df of hh models with om anisotropy is completely expressible in an analytical way .",
    "this family of models is made by the superposition of a stellar and a dark matter distribution both following the hernquist profile , with different total masses and core radii .",
    "the concentration and the amount of the stellar and dark matter distributions are described by four free parameters , and the orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components , following the om prescription .",
    "a particularly interesting case is obtained for a null core radius of the `` halo '' , so mimicking a central bh .",
    "the study of hh models is also useful for many different reasons : to provide an analytical df for a two - component cuspy system for which the analytical solution of the jeans equations is also available ( @xcite ) ; to investigate the rle of anisotropy and mass distribution of each component in determining the positivity of their df ; to compute in an accurate and `` easy '' way the model line - profiles , to arrange initial conditions for numerical simulations of two - component systems .    in section 2",
    "i briefly review the method presented in cp92 , formulating it in a way suitable for its application to the present problem .",
    "then in section 3 i introduce the hh models , and use the previous method to discuss the limits imposed on their parameters by the positivity of the df of the two components .",
    "it is proved that globally isotropic hh models are consistent for any mass ratio and core radii ratio , even in the case of a central bh . in this last case the analytical expression for a lower limit of the anisotropy radius of the host system as a function of the bh mass is given . in section 4",
    "i derive the df for hh models , and their differential energy distribution in the case of global isotropy ; some velocity sections of the df are also shown . in the case of a dominant halo",
    "it is found that the df of an hh component can be expressed only through elementary functions . a particular case  corresponding to a hernquist model with a central bh ",
    "is extensively discussed . in section 5 the exact boundary of the region of consistency in the parameter space",
    "is obtained using the df , and the results are compared with those given in section 3 . in the same section the stability of globally isotropic hh models",
    "is proved , and a discussion on the stability of the anisotropic case is given . finally in section 6 the main results are summarized .",
    "more important than the construction of its spatial and projected velocity dispersion profile is checking whether a galaxy ( or a galaxy cluster ) model is consistent , i.e. , is described by a df everywhere non - negative . if a system is described as a sum of different density components @xmath10 , then _ each _",
    "@xmath11 must be non negative .",
    "this requirement leads us to introduce the concept of consistent multi - component decomposition of a system , as discussed in cp92 , together with the main theorem used here .",
    "this theorem permits us to check whether the df of a multi - component spherical system where the orbital anisotropy of each component is described by the om anisotropy is positive , _ without _ calculating it effectively . in the om formulation",
    "the radially anisotropic case is obtained as a consequence of assuming @xmath12 with : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the relative energy and the angular momentum modulus per unit mass , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the so - called _",
    "anisotropy radius_. with this assumption the models are characterized by radial anisotropy increasing with the galactic radius , and in the limits @xmath19 the velocity dispersion tensor is globally isotropic . for a multi - component",
    "spherical system , the simple relation between energy and angular momentum prescribed by equation ( 1 ) allows to express the df of the k  th component as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 is the relative total potential , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the second equivalence in equation ( 2 ) holds for untruncated systems with a finite total mass ( see , bt87 , p.240 ) , as the hh models here discussed . the original theorem , given in cp92 in terms of the model radius ,",
    "is here formulated in terms of the relative potential @xmath25 of the investigated component , since this formulation makes the treatment of hh models easier .",
    ": necessary condition for the non negativity of @xmath11 given in equation ( 2 ) is : @xmath26 if this necessary condition is satisfied , a _ strong sufficient condition _",
    "( ssc ) for the non negativity of @xmath11 is : @xmath27\\geq 0 , \\quad 0\\leq\\psii\\leq\\psii(0).\\ ] ] : see cp92 .",
    "note that a _ weak sufficient condition _ ( wsc ) @xmath28\\geq 0\\ ] ] is obtained in a much easier way using the last expression in equation ( 2 ) , requiring that @xmath29 .",
    "the wsc is obviously better suited than the ssc for analytical investigations , due to the absence of the weighting square root of the total potential .",
    "some considerations follow looking at the previous conditions .",
    "the first is that the violation of the necessary condition [ eq . ( 4 ) ] is connected only with the radial behavior of @xmath10 and the value of @xmath30 , and so this condition is valid _ independently _ of any other interacting component added to the model .",
    "even when the necessary condition is satisfied , @xmath31 can be negative , due to the radial behavior of the integrand in equation ( 2 ) , which depends on the total potential , on the particular @xmath10 , and on @xmath30 : some permitted values of @xmath30 satisfying the necessary condition must be discarded . naturally , the true critical anisotropy radius is always larger than or equal to that given by the necessary condition , and smaller than or equal to that given by ssc and wsc .",
    "the previous analysis has been performed obtaining analytical or numerical limits on @xmath18 for some widely used models : for example , in cp92 the king ( 1972 ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) , and quasi - isothermal density distributions were discussed , and more recently the jaffe ( 1983 ) , hernquist ( h90 ) and plummer ( 1911 ) distributions ( @xcite ) .    a complete analysis of the hh models is given in the next paragraph , deriving the analytical constraints on @xmath18 for 1 ) an h model , 2 ) an h model with a central bh , and finally 3 ) showing the consistency of the general hh model in the case of global isotropy .",
    "in the study of the hh models , some simplification arises from the fact that both components are described by the same functional form .",
    "so , i do not distinguish between `` stars '' and `` dark matter '' , but simply between a _ reference _ system and a _ halo _ system .",
    "the mass @xmath32 and the core radius @xmath33 of the reference system are the normalization constants , so that its density distribution is : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( h90 ) .",
    "the halo density is described by another hernquist distribution , of mass @xmath37 and core radius @xmath38 : @xmath39 then the hh density profiles are fully determined by fixing the four independent parameters @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "note that for @xmath43 the hh models reduce to the h model , and that for @xmath44 the halo density is more concentrated than the reference component .",
    "the fundamental ingredient in recovering the df is the relative potential @xmath45 , that for the reference component is @xmath46 and for the halo @xmath47 with @xmath48 ( h90 ) .",
    "note how for @xmath49 the halo potential is that of a bh of mass @xmath50 placed at the center of the reference system .",
    "as it will become clear in  4 , a fundamental property of hh models is that their total potential can be expressed as a simple function of the reference potential , namely @xmath51 where the interval @xmath52 is monotonically mapped onto @xmath53 .      here",
    "i apply first the necessary condition to the h model to determine the _ critical _ anisotropy radius such that a higher degree of radial om anisotropy produces a negative df , no matter what kind of halo density distribution is added .",
    "the first step is to express the modified density @xmath54 [ see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] as a function of the relative potential @xmath55 , obtaining : @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the dimensionless anisotropy radius .    as shown in appendix a [ eqs .",
    "( a1)-(a2 ) ] , the necessary condition can be treated analytically , requiring @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the value of the potential for which the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( a1 ) is maximum . in fig .",
    "1 the solid line at the bottom represents the derived lower bound for the anisotropy radius .    moving to the study of the sufficient conditions ,",
    "i apply first the ssc .",
    "the calculations can be performed analytically , and the result is : @xmath60 [ eqs .",
    "( a3)-(a5 ) ] , a limit obviously higher than that obtained from the necessary condition .",
    "the true limit on @xmath61 for the h model is within the two previous values , and in fact its value determined directly from the df is @xmath62 ( see  4.2 ) . in fig . 1 this value",
    "is represented by the solid line in the middle .",
    "the result of the application of the wsc to the h model will be obtained as a limiting case of the more general analysis done in the next paragraph .      in order to proceed further with this analytical discussion , and to consider the more complicated case of the presence of the halo",
    ", we need to use the wsc rather than the ssc , due to the presence of the square root of the total potential in the ssc .",
    "i now prove two important results :    1 .   in the case of a h+bh model ( i.e. , an h model with a central bh of mass @xmath63 ) the wsc permits us to recover analytically a minimum value of the anisotropy radius as a function of the central bh mass ; 2 .",
    "_ globally isotropic _ hh models can be consistently constructed for _ any value _ of @xmath64 .",
    "particularly this means that _ a globally isotropic h model can consistently host a bh of any mass at its center .",
    "_    in the case of a central bh the wsc prescribes that : @xmath65 [ eqs .",
    "( a6)-(a10 ) ] , and corresponds to the uppermost solid line in fig .",
    "1 . as intuitive , an increase of the bh mass produces an increase of the critical anisotropy radius , i.e. , a decrease in the maximum value allowed for the radial anisotropy .",
    "two interesting consequences can be obtained performing the asymptotic analysis of the previous equation , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of equation ( 15 ) for @xmath66 is @xmath68 , and so just a slight reduction in anisotropy with respect to the one - component model is required by the presence of a bh of any mass ; and the finite value of @xmath69 implies that a globally isotropic model can host a central bh of any mass .",
    "the limiting case of the previous analysis for @xmath43 is the wsc applied to the h model , and completes the discussion given in  3.1 .",
    "the limit for @xmath67 of equation ( 15 ) is @xmath70 and the comparison of this value with the limit on the anisotropy radius derived from the ssc ( @xmath71 ) is instructive : the difference is due to the weight factor of the square root of the potential , contained in the ssc and absent in the wsc .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the ssc in the case of a bh is very easy , and the result is plotted in fig .",
    "1 ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "a second interesting case for which the wsc can be treated analytically is that of a completely isotropic component of the hh model : in appendix a it is shown that its df is positive for any choice of @xmath64 . incidentally , this gives another proof that it is always possible to couple consistently a bh of any mass with a globally isotropic h model , in accordance with the previous result .",
    "after the preliminary discussion we can now proceed to the explicit recovering of the df . due to the fact that both density components of the hh model are described by the same functional form , it suffices to compute the df for the reference component with generic @xmath64 , and then also the df for the halo component is easily recovered .",
    "as for the density and the potential , also for @xmath7 it is useful to work with dimensionless functions .",
    "so , for the reference component @xmath72 with @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . for the halo component a similar functional form holds , where the two dimensional constants are now the mass and the core radius of the halo , and the two dimensionless parameters are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the df for the halo component is then obtained from that of the reference component changing the normalization constant @xmath77 to @xmath78 , substituting the dimensionless parameters @xmath64 with their inverses , and re - scaling the parameter @xmath79 to the halo central potential .    the easiest way to compute",
    "the df is to use the first of the identities in equation ( 2 ) . for the evaluation of the integral one",
    "would be tempted to express @xmath80 eliminating the radial coordinate from the modified density and the total potential : this can be formally done , but the resulting expression for the radius involves a quadratic irrationality , that after insertion in equations ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) produces an intractable expression . here",
    "i follow another approach : instead of eliminating the radius , the variable of integration is changed from the total potential to the potential of the reference component .",
    "this is equivalent to a remapping of the domain of definition of the df , from the range of variation of @xmath81 to the range of variation of @xmath45 , and leads to introduce a new parameter @xmath82 , defined from equation ( 11 ) as : @xmath83 with this change of variable , the df is given by equations ( b1)-(b3 ) , but as shown subsequently in appendix b , this is again _ not _ the _ natural _ parameterization for @xmath7 , that is finally obtained defining the variable : @xmath84 after normalizing to the dimensional scales of the reference component , its df can be formally written as : @xmath85 ; \\quad l = l^{-1}(\\qtil),\\ ] ] where the subscripts refer to the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the df respectively , and @xmath86 the sign @xmath87 in equation ( 19 ) corresponds to the case @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given in appendix b. note how with the followed procedure @xmath92 results from the elimination of the parameter @xmath82 between equations ( 17 ) and ( 18)-(19 ) .",
    "a first ( but algebraically cumbersome ) check of the derived formula is obtained evaluating analytically its limit for @xmath43 , and recovering the df of the h model given by h90 . the lengthy proof is not given here . in the general case of @xmath93 ,",
    "a check is obtained by confrontation of the analytical df with that derived by direct numerical inversion of equation ( 2 ) : the two families of curves are indistinguishable , with percentual errors smaller than @xmath94 .    in fig . 2 ( upper panel ) some dfs are shown in the case of global isotropy .",
    "their main characteristic is that when the halo is more extended than the reference component ( dotted lines ) they are more peaked than the df of the h model ( solid line ) . on the contrary , for haloes more concentrated than the reference component ( short - dashed lines ) ,",
    "the dfs are flatter .",
    "a particular case is that corresponding to a central bh ( long - dashed lines ) : the dfs are positive  as discussed in  3.2  but _ not _ monotonically increasing near the model center . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 the df for the same models above are shown , but in this case the anisotropy radius is fixed to @xmath95 .",
    "the same qualitative comments as in the isotropic case apply .    an important feature of fig .",
    "2 is the radically different behavior of @xmath7 for @xmath96 : while for any finite core radius of the halo the df of the reference component diverges near the center , in the presence of a central bh the df converges , i.e. , the df for the bh case can not be obtained _ directly _ as a limit for @xmath97 of the df with @xmath98 .",
    "the discontinuity in the df behavior at high energies is due to the coefficient of the function @xmath99 in equation ( b12 ) : the limit for @xmath97 of the product between the coefficient and @xmath99 does not vanish , on the contrary , for @xmath100 this term is zero .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the halo potential is uniformly continuous on @xmath101 for @xmath98 , but for @xmath100 the uniform continuity is lost , and so the equivalence of the limit for @xmath97 before and after integration is not guaranteed anymore .",
    "a more direct way to look at this discontinuity is to perform an asymptotic expansion of the df for @xmath96 . a brute force ( and highly error prone ) approach would be the expansion of the expressions given in appendix b for @xmath96 , but a cleaner asymptotic expansion can be obtained instead expanding directly equations ( b1)-(b3 ) : for @xmath98 the leading term is @xmath102 ^ 2\\over \\mu+[1+(\\beta-1)q]^2 } { \\beta\\over\\sqrt{\\mu+\\beta^2}(1-q)^{5/2}},\\quad q\\to 1.\\ ] ] the order of divergency , also in presence of the halo , is equal to that given in h90 , and assuming @xmath43 or @xmath103 the correct asymptotic formula for the h model is recovered .",
    "used in h90 is the square root of the parameter used in this paper . ]    consistently with the previous discussion the asymptotic formula for @xmath96 in the case of a central bh _ can not _ be obtained as the limiting case of the previous formula when @xmath100 , due to a change in the order of the singularity in equation ( b2 ) .",
    "the correct treatment in this case gives : @xmath104 and the convergence to 0 of the df is proved .",
    "finally , note how the presence of anisotropy does not affect the behavior of the df for high relative energies , as dictated by equation ( 12 ) , where it can be easily seen that the divergence of the modified density near the model center ",
    "the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the df  is only due to its isotropic part .",
    "the asymptotic formulae ( 21)-(22 ) have been checked numerically for many choices of @xmath64 by direct comparison with the df , and the agreement is excellent .",
    "the representation of the df as function of the integral of motion @xmath79 is not easily interpreted when orbital anisotropy is present .",
    "more intuitive are the _ velocity sections _ of @xmath7 , i.e. , for some fixed @xmath105 the distributions of @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the radial and tangential velocity components , respectively . in fig .",
    "3 the sections @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the h model with @xmath95 are shown .",
    "obviously , for global isotropy the two distributions are equal , and for anisotropic systems they become more and more similar moving from radii greater than @xmath18 to smaller radii , according to the radial trend of anisotropy implied by the om parameterization . as expected , for a finite value of @xmath18 , moving outward the tangential orbits become more and more de - populated , and this is compensated by an increase in the number of high velocity radial orbits .",
    "the presence of a massive diffuse halo does not alter qualitatively the distributions , that maintain the same aspect .",
    "the only peculiar characteristic appears again in the case of the central bh , when the maximum of the distribution is placed off - center : this fact reflects the central behavior of the df described previously . as a final and general remark on these sections ,",
    "one can note how they depart appreciably from a maxwellian distribution .",
    "in the case of global isotropy the differential energy distribution @xmath110 for each component of the hh models can be derived analytically as a function of the parameter @xmath111 . as shown by bt87 ( p.243 ) , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the density of states , and @xmath114 .",
    "the explicit form for @xmath115 is given in appendix c , and the sign @xmath87 correspond to the case @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "again , a first check of the derived formula can be obtained evaluating analytically its limit for @xmath43 , and recovering the @xmath116 as given by h90 ; as in the case of the df , the proof is cumbersome , and not shown here .",
    "when also a halo is present , the check is obtained by direct comparison with the density of states derived by numerical integration of equation ( c2 ) . over the whole energy range the curves are indistinguishable .",
    "@xmath110 is plotted in fig .",
    "4 : when the halo is more extended than the reference component ( @xmath117 , dotted lines ) , @xmath110 is not steadily increasing in the outer part of the system anymore .      in the case of a halo dominated model , i.e. , when the self - gravity of the reference component is negligible , the df and @xmath110 can be expanded for @xmath66 , and the resulting expressions are combinations of elementary functions of @xmath111 . for brevity , and due to its major importance",
    ", the explicit form of the functions entering the df are given only .",
    "in this case , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are given by equations ( b8)-(b9 ) with : @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124      in this case , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are given by equation ( b12)-(b13 ) with : @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 in the particular case of a dominating central mass , the df is obtained setting @xmath100 in equations ( b12)-(b13 ) , eliminating the term containing @xmath99 , and using equations ( 29)-(32 ) with @xmath133 .",
    "we can now explore the parameter space of hh models , studying numerically the formulae derived in  4 . the simplest way to summarize the results",
    "is to express the consistency limitations in terms of the ( normalized ) anisotropy radius of the reference component .",
    "this is particularly indicated because : 1 ) we know from the introductory discussion ( @xmath134 3.2 ) that the globally isotropic component of the hh model is consistent whatever the halo component is ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) , and 2 ) in the case of the om anisotropy , the anisotropy radius can be isolated in the df .",
    "so , in the parameter space @xmath136 it is easy to determine the critical value @xmath137 defined as the anisotropy radius such that for @xmath138 there exists at least one permitted value of the potential for which @xmath139 . imposing the positivity of @xmath7 over all the domain @xmath140 , from equation ( 19 )",
    "one obtains : @xmath141_{q\\in ] 0,1[}.\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "1 different curves @xmath142 are plotted , for a varying halo mass , and for fixed values of @xmath143 . as expected",
    "no model permits a smaller value of the anisotropy radius than that derived from the necessary condition .",
    "the intermediate solid line is the value of the exact limit on the anisotropy radius for the h model , @xmath144 .",
    "the upper solid curve is the plot of the wsc in the case of a central bh of normalized mass @xmath145 .",
    "as described in  3.2 this curve approaches asymptotically the value @xmath146 .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines represent the lower bound on the anisotropy radius for various @xmath143 . clearly",
    "all the families of curves for @xmath67 converge to the value required by the h model .",
    "the first result is that the critical anisotropy radius for each model is not strongly dependent on the halo mass , and it is always contained between the value given by the necessary condition and that obtained from the ssc applied to the h+bh model .",
    "the second result is that all models with @xmath125 ( short - dashed lines ) have a critical anisotropy radius higher than the h model : as expected a model with a concentrated halo can not sustain also too much anisotropy .",
    "the long - dashed line represents the case of a central bh : anisotropy radii higher than the values represented by this curve can be assumed independently of the halo structure and mass .",
    "the third result is that all models in which the halo is more extended than the reference component can have a slightly smaller anisotropy radius than the h model , but in this case the effect is much less stronger than for a @xmath147 halo : as already found in cp92 , the most diffuse component of a multi - component system is also the most `` delicate '' concerning the consistency .",
    "finally , note how all the curves become flat asymptotically .",
    "their limiting value can not be obtained directly using equation ( 19 ) for very high @xmath145 values , due to the numerical precision loss of the intervening functions . on the contrary",
    "a very accurate analysis can be performed using the asymptotic functions given in  4.3 , and the result is plotted in fig .",
    "5 .      as important as the discussion on the consistency of hh models is the location of the region of _ stability _ for such systems .",
    "a complete stability analysis is beyond the task of this work , requiring n - body simulations or normal mode analysis , but some interesting conclusions can be equally derived , at least for the globally isotropic case .",
    "in fact in this case powerful theorems are at our disposition : for stability against both radial and nonradial perturbations it is sufficient ( but not necessary ! ) that the system df ( in our case the sum of the df of the halo and of the reference component ) is an increasing function of the relative binding energy @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , bt87 , p.296 - 307 , @xcite , p.152 - 163 ) .    in the performed numerical exploration of the parameter space @xmath64 all the dfs _ with _",
    "@xmath148 are monotonically increasing functions of the parameter @xmath82 , as shown for some particular cases in fig .",
    "2 . changing the parameter @xmath82 of each component to @xmath14",
    "using equation ( 17 ) , and taking the derivative shows that the _ globally isotropic hh models are stable_. unfortunately the sufficient condition above can not be applied to the globally isotropic case with a central bh : the condition @xmath149 is not verified , due to the convergence of the df to 0 , and so only numerical investigations can answer this interesting problem .    for anisotropic systems the situation is more complex , for the lack of general theorems .",
    "in any case some hint can be obtained by the empirical requirement that @xmath150 ( @xcite , p.235 ) in order to avoid the radial orbit instability , where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the total radial and tangential kinetic energies of the system , and the exact value of @xmath153 is model dependent .",
    "a second complication with the previous criterion arises form the fact that a generalization to multi - component systems is not obvious , as shown by stiavelli and sparke ( 1991 ) . in the same paper",
    "the authors show with the aid of n - body simulations that the presence of a halo does not change very much the situation with respect to the one - component model . for hh models with om anisotropy",
    "the evaluation of @xmath151 and @xmath152 can be done analytically , but the resulting formulae for @xmath98 are complicated . for these reasons",
    "i show here only the trend of the parameter @xmath154 for the particular case of the h+bh system : the simpler case of an h model is obtained for @xmath43 . from the virial theorem @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the gravitational energy of the h model , @xmath157 is its interaction energy with the bh , and so @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "choosing as the energy normalization @xmath159 , it results @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , with @xmath163-\\nonumber\\\\               &    & { \\sat [ \\pi\\ln(1+\\sad)+\\sa\\phi(-\\sad,2,1/2)]\\over 4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath164\\over 4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i have used for @xmath165 required in the integration the expression given in ciotti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) [ eqs .",
    "( a1)-(a3 ) ] , and the function @xmath166 is the lerch transcendent ( see , e.g. , @xcite vol.1 , p.27 ) . in fig .",
    "6 the function @xmath167 is plotted for various @xmath145 values , and the asymptotic flattening to unity for increasing isotropy is evident .",
    "the first comment is that the stability criterion requires , also in the conservative hypothesis of a very high value of @xmath153 ( i.e. @xmath168 ) , minimum anisotropy radii appreciably larger than those obtained form the consistency analysis . for example , the minimum anisotropy radius permitted for an h model is @xmath169 , much higher than the value required by the simple consistency , @xmath170 .",
    "so , it is likely that the more radially anisotropic hh models with positive df are with any probability radial orbit instability prone .",
    "another important comment concerns the relation between the relative distribution of the halo and of the reference component . as can be seen from fig .",
    "6 , haloes more extended than the reference component make the model more unstable ; on the contrary , more stable systems are obtained for more concentrated haloes .",
    "this is easily explained looking at the radial trend of the velocity dispersion as a function of the anisotropy radius . for extended haloes ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is mainly increased in the outer parts of the model , where also the orbits are strongly radial , and this correspondingly increases the @xmath167 value ; the opposite happens for very concentrated haloes . particularly explicit",
    "are the two lines in fig .",
    "6 referring to a central bh : in this case the velocity dispersion is essentially increased only at the model center , where isotropy is nearly realized , and the stability indicator remains low also for small values of @xmath18 .",
    "but in this case probably the global indicator @xmath167 looses its meaning , due to a very strong _ decoupling _ between the central and the outer parts of the model .",
    "in this paper an extensive analytical investigation of two - component spherical galaxy ( or cluster ) models , made of the sum of two hernquist density distributions with different physical scales , is carried out . a variable amount of orbital anisotropy is also allowed in both components .",
    "these models , characterized by a power - law density profile in their central regions  both in the visible and in the dark matter distribution  reproduce the main properties of early - type galaxies as revealed by hubble space telescope observations , and also of the dark matter distribution as obtained in recent n - body simulations .",
    "the main results presented in this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the analytical expression for the df of hh models with general om anisotropy is presented and discussed , even for the particular case of an hernquist model with a central bh .",
    "the special case of a dominant dark halo is also discussed , and it is shown that under this assumption the df can be asymptotically expressed using just elementary functions . in the case of global isotropy the analytical expression for the differential energy distribution of both components is obtained .",
    "some velocity sections of the df are shown and discussed .",
    "2 .   the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to correspond to a consistent system ( i.e. , a system for which each physically distinct component has a positive df ) are analytically derived using the method introduced in cp92 .",
    "it is proved that globally isotropic hh models are consistent for any mass ratio and core radii ratio , even in the special case in which the `` halo '' reduces to a bh . in the case of a central bh and of variable anisotropy for the host system , the analytical expression for a minimum anisotropy radius as a function of the bh mass",
    "the region in the parameter space in which hh models are consistent is subsequently explored using the df .",
    "the main result is that the presence of a massive halo does not affect significantly the maximum anisotropy that can be sustained by a consistent model .",
    "it is shown that the presence of a halo with a core radius larger than that of the reference component allows a slightly higher degree of anisotropy with respect to the one - component hernquist model .",
    "on the contrary , a halo with a smaller core radius imposes a larger value for the minimum anisotropy radius than that proper of the h model .",
    "the most restrictive case is that of a central bh . in any case , for a given core radius of the halo there is a lower limit to the minimum anisotropy radius that approaches an asymptotic value for a dominant halo mass .",
    "finally , it is proved that isotropic hh models are stable , except for the case of a central bh , when no conclusions can be drawn . for anisotropic models the stability parameter against radial orbit instability",
    "is briefly discussed , and it is shown that with high probability the most anisotropic _ consistent _ hh models are unstable .",
    "i would like to thank giuseppe bertin and silvia pellegrini for helpful comments and discussions .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the italian ministry of research ( murst ) .",
    "in this appendix i apply the cp92 method to the hh models , as discussed in @xmath134 3 .",
    "the necessary condition for the h model imposes through equation ( 4 ) a limitation on the anisotropy radius : @xmath171 the requirement is that @xmath172 is larger than or equal to the maximum of the function on the r.h.s .. this is reached at @xmath173 that , after back substitution in equation ( a1 ) , gives equation ( 13 ) .",
    "the ssc applied to the h model gives the following inequality : @xmath174 after differentiation , discarding the two complex conjugates roots of the resulting cubic equation , and defining @xmath175 the maximum of the r.h.s .",

    "the wsc applied to the h+bh model is obtained from equation ( 6 ) with @xmath177 .",
    "the inequality to be verified for a given @xmath145 is : @xmath178 taking the derivative of the r.h.s .",
    "we are left with the discussion of a rational function whose denominator is strictly positive , and the numerator is a polynomial of fifth degree , that fortunately can be factorized in a term of second degree strictly positive , and the cubic : @xmath179 observing that @xmath180 and @xmath181 , there is at least one solution of @xmath182 between 0 and 1 .",
    "this solution is also the only one , because the determinant of the cubic @xmath183 @xmath184 is positive @xmath185 : from the theory of algebraic equations , @xmath182 admits one and only one real solution . finally , considering the sign of @xmath183 we proved that the solution @xmath59 corresponds to a maximum . defining @xmath186^{1/3},\\ ] ]",
    "one obtains @xmath187 that after substitution in equation ( a6 ) gives equation ( 15 ) .",
    "when @xmath43 , the value at which the maximum is reached can be calculated directly from equations ( a9)-(a10 ) , obtaining : @xmath188^{1/3},\\ ] ] and @xmath189 that after substitution in eq .",
    "( a6 ) with @xmath43 gives eq .",
    "( 16 ) .",
    "the application of the wsc to the globally isotropic hh models is more complicated . after having computed the derivatives in equation ( 6 )",
    ", we have to investigate the positivity of a rational expression , whose denominator is strictly positive @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath185 and @xmath52 .",
    "the numerator of this function factorizes in a strictly positive function and in the polynomial : @xmath192 where @xmath193    it is trivial to show that the second addend of equation ( a13 ) is strictly positive .",
    "i prove now that also @xmath194 is positive for @xmath195 and for @xmath52 : so the wsc is satisfied for any choice of @xmath196 and the globally isotropic hh models are consistent .",
    "first of all , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , and so after excluding the presence of roots of @xmath194 in the interval [ 0,1 ] , the proof is obtained .",
    "this can be accomplished using the classical sturm method , i.e. , counting the differences in the number of variations between 0 and 1 in the sturm sequence @xmath199 associated to @xmath200 and discussing it as a function of the parameter @xmath201 . but a faster proof can be obtained as follows .",
    "since @xmath194 does not change sign between 0 and 1 , only an _ even _ number of roots can be contained in the interval .",
    "if we show that equation ( a14 ) admits only one real solution then the proof is obtained .",
    "the discriminant of @xmath194 @xmath202 is strictly positive , and so the cubic equation admits one and only one real solution , that is necessarily placed outside the interval [ 0,1 ] , and @xmath203 for @xmath52 .",
    "in this appendix the main analytical steps required for the determination of the df are described .",
    "as discussed in  4 , the first step is to change the integration variable from the total potential to the potential of the reference component . after a normalization , equation ( 2 )",
