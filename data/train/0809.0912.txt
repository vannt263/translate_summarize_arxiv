    "the sqls also recovered nine previously known lensed quasars included in the sdss footprint @xcite .",

    "the sqls restricts the statistical lens sample to @xmath17 because we can not make a well - defined quasar sample for homogeneous lens surveys at higher redshifts .",

    "sdss  j0819 + 5356 was selected as a lens candidate in the sdss - i , and the other four lenses were selected as lens candidates in the sdss - ii sloan legacy survey .",
    "the sdss consists of a photometric @xcite and a spectroscopic survey , and has mapped approximately 10,000 square degrees primarily in a region centered on the north galactic cap , through the sdss - i and the subsequent sdss - ii legacy survey .",
    "the survey was conducted with a dedicated wide - field 2.5-m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory in new mexico , usa .",
    "the photometric survey uses five broad - band optical filters ( @xmath24 , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectroscopic survey is carried out with a multi - fiber spectrograph covering 3800 to 9200 with a resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "the data in each imaging observation are processed by the photometric pipeline @xcite , and then the target selection pipelines @xcite find quasar and galaxy candidates ; the candidates are tiled in each plate according to the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the sdss produces very homogeneous data with an astrometric accuracy better than about @xmath26 rms per coordinate @xcite and photometric zeropoint accuracy better than about 0.02 magnitude over the entire survey area @xcite .",
    "the sdss is continuously making its data public @xcite .",
    "the final release ( date release seven ) was made on 2008 october 31 .",
    "the lensed quasar candidate selection algorithm of the sqls @xcite is composed of two parts . one is `` morphological selection '' , which selects candidates as extended quasars using the difference between the shapes of each quasar and the point spread function ( psf ) in each field . the other method is `` color selection '' , which finds quasars with objects ( usually fainter ) within @xmath27 , whose colors are similar to the quasars .",
    "although the selection algorithm is basically designed for quasars with @xmath13 , we can easily extend it to target higher redshift quasars by shifting to longer wavelength bands , as absorption significantly reddens colors at wavelengths shortward of the ly@xmath28 emission line .",
    "@xcite . for example , we can search for quasars with @xmath29 using information from the @xmath30 bands rather than the @xmath31 bands used at lower redshifts @xcite , and @xmath32 using the @xmath33 bands .",
    "we selected sdss  j0819 + 5356 , sdss  j1258 + 1657 , and sdss  j1400 + 3134 as lens candidates by morphological selection with @xmath30 ( or @xmath33 for sdss  j1400 + 3134 ) , and sdss  j1254 + 2235 and sdss  j1339 + 1310 by color selection with @xmath30 .",
    "sdss  j0819 + 5356 was not selected by color selection despite its large image separation , because of the presence of the bright lensing galaxy between the two stellar components .",
    "we note that sdss  j0819 + 5356 was also selected as a possible lensed ly@xmath28 emitting galaxy by the algorithm described in @xcite to identify strong galaxy - galaxy lenses .",
    "the sdss @xmath34-band images of the fields around each lensed quasar candidate are shown in figure  [ fig : finding ] .",
    "the sdss asinh magnitudes @xcite without galactic extinction corrections and redshifts of the five objects are summarized in table  [ tab : sdss ] .",
    "the @xmath35-band asinh magnitude of sdss j1254 + 2235 is not given because it is undetected in the @xmath35-band .",
    "all five candidates appear to be doubly - imaged lenses in the sdss images , as we will confirm with the imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations described in the next section .",
    "as described in @xcite , our criteria to confirm the lensing hypothesis for a candidate double - image lensed quasar are 1 ) the existence of a lensing object between the two stellar ( quasar ) components , and 2 ) similar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the two quasar images .",
    "all five candidates are marginally resolved in the sdss imaging data and spatially unresolved in the sdss spectroscopic data ( the fiber diameter is 3@xmath36 and the minimum separation between each fiber on a single plate is @xmath37 ) , and therefore we conducted optical / near - infrared imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations to confirm their lensing natures , using the uh88 , arc 3.5 m , and tng 3.6 m telescopes .",
    "we obtained @xmath38 images for all five candidates and @xmath39 images for sdss  j0819 + 5356 with the tektronix 2048@xmath402048 ccd camera ( tek2k , 022 pixel@xmath41 ) at the uh88 telescope .",
    "the observations were conducted on 2007 april 11 , 2007 november 13 , and 2008 march 6 , with typical seeing of fwhm@xmath1408 .",
    "the exposures were between 300 and 480 sec depending on the magnitudes of the objects and the observing conditions in each night , and 800 sec for the @xmath39 band image of sdss  j0819 + 5356 .",
    "the instruments , observing dates , and exposure times for these observations are summarized in tables  [ tab : followup1 ] and [ tab : followup2 ] .",
    "the @xmath42-band images of all five candidates are shown in the left column of figure  [ fig : uh - iband ] . in each image , we clearly detect two stellar components ( denoted as a and b ; a being the brighter component ) with typical separations of @xmath43 , except for sdss  j0819 + 5356 , which has a larger image separation of 404 .",
    "the @xmath44 images for sdss  j0819 + 5356 clearly show an extended object ( component g ) between components a and b , which we interpret as the lensing galaxy . to see whether the other four candidates also have lensing galaxies between the stellar components , we subtracted two psfs from the @xmath38 images of each candidate , using nearby stars as psf templates . in all 12 images , the @xmath38 images of the four candidates ,",
    "there is extended residual flux between components a and b that we designate component g. the @xmath42-band psf subtracted images are shown in the lower four panels of the middle column of figure  [ fig : uh - iband ] . the morphology of the lensing galaxy of sdss  j1400 + 3134 appears to be unusual due to its low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "finally we subtracted two psfs plus an extended component modeled by a srsic profile using galfit @xcite from the @xmath38 images of the four candidates ; the resulting images show virtually no residuals ( see the lower four panels of the right column in figure  [ fig : uh - iband ] ) .",
    "we also subtracted two psfs , and two psfs plus a galaxy component , from the @xmath44 images of sdss  j0819 + 5356 .",
    "the results from the @xmath42-band image are shown in the top panels of the middle and right columns of figure  [ fig : uh - iband ] .",
    "we detect a residual flux ( component c ) around component a in the `` 2psfs+1 g '' subtracted images ( in all @xmath44 bands ) .",
    "this component appears to be distorted along the critical curve of the system , and therefore might be the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar .",
    "we summarize the parameters of the best - fitting srsic profiles ( in @xmath42-band images ) of each lensing galaxy in table  [ tab : sersic ] .",
    "the very large @xmath45 parameter for sdss  j0819 + 5356 implies that the lensing galaxy has a steep inner profile .",
    "for sdss  j1400 + 3134 , we can not measure the correct shape of the residual flux ( after subtracting two psfs ) even in the @xmath42-band image due to its faintness .",
    "additional near - infrared ( @xmath46-band ) images for sdss  j1339 + 1310 and sdss  j1400 + 3134 were taken with the near - infrared camera and fabry - perot spectrometer ( nicfps , 0273 pixel@xmath41 ) at the arc 3.5 m telescope , on 2007 march 8 and 2007 april 5 .",
    "the exposures were 900 sec for both objects ( see also tables  [ tab : followup1 ] and [ tab : followup2 ] ) .",
    "the lensing galaxies are easily detected in the @xmath46-band images ; we can see them even in the original images shown in the left column of figure  [ fig : arc - hband ] .",
    "we again subtracted two psfs and two psfs plus a galaxy component using galfit .",
    "the results are shown in the middle and right columns of figure  [ fig : arc - hband ] .",
    "the results further support the existence of the lensing objects for sdss  j1339 + 1310 and sdss  j1400 + 3134 .",
    "the relative astrometry ( from the tek2k @xmath42-band images ) and the absolute photometry ( landolt - vega system ; * ? ? ? * ) for the @xmath44-band observations of the five candidates are summarized in table  [ tab : ap ] .",
    "for all candidates , the differences of the relative positions among each filter are less than @xmath14005 for the stellar components and @xmath14015 for the extended components .",
    "we used the standard star pg  0918 + 029 @xcite for the optical ( @xmath44 ) magnitude calibration .",
    "we estimated the @xmath46 magnitudes using the two micron all sky survey data @xcite of nearby stars .    to summarize the imaging observations ,",
    "we detect extended objects between the two stellar components in all five candidates , which we naturally interpret as the lensing galaxies .",
    "to determine the seds of the stellar components of each candidate , we conducted spectroscopic observations using the wide field grism spectrograph 2 ( wfgs2 ; * ? ? ? * ) at the uh88 telescope , the dual imaging spectrograph ( dis ) at the arc 3.5 m telescope , and the device optimized for the low resolution ( dolores ) at the tng 3.6 m telescope .",
    "we used a 09 long slit and the 300 gr / mm grism ( spectral resolution of @xmath47 and spatial scale of the ccd detector of 034 pixel@xmath41 ) for wfgs2 , a 15 long slit and the b400 grism ( @xmath48 and 040 pixel@xmath41 ) for dis , and , a 10 long slit and the lr - b grism ( @xmath47 and 0252 pixel@xmath41 ) for dolores .",
    "we aligned each slit direction to observe components a and b simultaneously .",
    "the exposures were typically @xmath142000 sec for the arc 3.5 m and tng 3.6 m telescopes and @xmath145000 sec for the uh88 telescope .",
    "the instruments , observing dates , and exposures for the spectroscopic observations are also summarized in tables  [ tab : followup1 ] and [ tab : followup2 ] .",
    "all spectroscopic observations were conducted under good seeing conditions ( fwhm@xmath4910 ) .",
    "the spectrum of each component was extracted by the standard iraf tasks , and are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the data show that the two stellar components of each candidate have quite similar seds .",
    "in particular , the two quasar components of sdss  j0819 + 5356 and sdss  j1254 + 2235 have similar broad absorption line features .",
    "therefore , together with the existence of the extended objects between the stellar components , we unambiguously conclude that sdss  j0819 + 5356 , sdss  j1254 + 2235 , sdss  j1258 + 1657 , sdss  j1339 + 1310 , and sdss  j1400 + 3134 are all lensed quasars .",
    "measurements of lens galaxy redshifts are important , because both source ( quasar ) and lens ( galaxy ) redshifts are necessary to convert dimensionless lensing quantities to physical units .",
    "although source redshift measurements of lensed quasar systems are relatively easy because of prominent quasar emission lines ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) , this is not the case for direct measurements of lens galaxy redshifts @xcite .",
    "indeed , we were not able to find any signal from the lensing galaxies in our spectra , except in sdss  j0819 + 5356 , for which we measure the redshift of the bright lensing galaxy to be @xmath50 from the h&k , g - band , , and absorption lines appearing in the sdss spectrum ( see figure  [ fig : j0819sdss ] ) .",
    "the lens redshift of sdss  j0819 + 5356 is also confirmed in the dis spectrum of component b , which shows the h&k lines at @xmath51 ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .    for the remaining objects",
    ", we roughly estimate the redshifts of the lensing galaxies by comparing the observed colors with the results of @xcite .",
    "we particularly use the @xmath52 colors ( table  [ tab : ap ] ) , since the lensing galaxies are faint in @xmath53-band . for sdss",
    "j1254 + 2235 , the @xmath52 color of 0.32 indicates that the redshift of the lensing galaxy is not high .",
    "therefore , combined with its srsic concentration index ( table  [ tab : sersic ] ) , we estimate that the lensing galaxy is a late - type galaxy at @xmath54 , rather than @xmath55 . for sdss",
    "j1258 + 1657 and sdss  j1339 + 1310 , their srsic index and @xmath52 colors of @xmath56 ( table  [ tab : sersic ] and table  [ tab : ap ] ) suggest that the lensing galaxies might be early - type galaxies at @xmath55 . assuming the early - type",
    ", we can further constrain the lens redshifts by comparing the observed magnitudes with the predicted magnitudes from the faber - jackson relation @xcite adopted by @xcite .",
    "the predicted magnitudes ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 for sdss  j1258 + 1657 and sdss  j1339 + 1310 , respectively ) assuming @xmath59 and using the observed image separations and table 3 of @xcite imply that the lens redshifts are less than @xmath55 and probably @xmath59 .",
    "although the morphology of the lensing galaxy of sdss  j1400 + 3134 is unknown , we estimate the lens redshift to be @xmath60 from the @xmath52 colors of @xmath61 . to summarize , we estimate the lens redshifts to be @xmath54 , @xmath59 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for sdss  j1254 + 2235 , sdss  j1258 + 1657 , sdss  j1339 + 1310 , and sdss  j1400 + 3134 , respectively .    in this paper , we use these results to derive the predicted time delays of each system ( see   [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "these estimates should also provide a useful guidance for the future direct measurements of the lens redshifts .",
    "in particular , the direct measurement of the lens redshift of sdss  j1339 + 1310 might be easy , both because it has the relatively large image separation ( @xmath62 ) and because the lensing galaxy is bright .",
    "we modeled the five systems using a mass model of a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) . the number of the model parameters ( 8 parameters ; the einstein radius @xmath63 , the ellipticity @xmath64 and its position angle @xmath65 , the position of the mass center , and the position and flux of the source quasar ) is the same as the number of the constraints from the observations ( 8 constraints ; the positions and fluxes of the two quasar components , and the position of the lensing galaxy ) , both because all five objects are doubly - imaged lenses and because we assume the centers of the mass models to be the same as the galaxy light centers .",
    "we adopt the observables from the @xmath42-band images as the constraints , and used _ lensmodel _",
    "@xcite for modeling . as expected from the zero degree of freedom for these models , we obtained models that fit the data perfectly ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting models and their 1@xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) uncertainties are summarized in table  [ tab : model ] .    for sdss",
    "j0819 + 5356 , the model ellipticity @xmath64 and its position angle @xmath65 ( table  [ tab : model ] ) agree with those observed for the lensing galaxy ( table  [ tab : sersic ] ) . except for sdss",
    "j0819 + 5356 , however , the predicted values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are in poor agreement with the observed values . such differences are common in lensed quasar systems when there are other nearby potentials producing a strong tidal shear @xcite .",
    "indeed , the predicted @xmath65 of sdss  j1258 + 1657 is aligned well with directions to the nearby two galaxies ( 50 north and 70 south from the object ) , whose photometric redshifts @xcite of @xmath69 are similar to the estimated lens redshift .",
    "a large misalignment is also seen in sdss  j1339 + 1310 , which have some nearby galaxies with the photometric redshifts of @xmath70 .",
    "we could not test the alignment for sdss  j1400 + 3134 , because we could not measure the shape of its lens galaxy in our images .",
    "in addition to the parameters of the best - fitting models , we summarize the predicted time delays and total magnifications in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties of the predicted time delays for the 1@xmath67 uncertainties of the parameters , and summarized them in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "the measured lens redshift for sdss  j0819 + 5356 and the estimated lens redshifts for the other four lenses are used to calculate the time delays .",
    "we discovered five high - redshift ( @xmath71 ) lensed quasars , sdss  j0819 + 5356 , sdss  j1254 + 2235 , sdss  j1258 + 1657 , sdss  j1339 + 1310 , and sdss  j1400 + 3134 from the sdss .",
    "they were confirmed to be lenses by the imaging and spectroscopic observations at the uh88 , arc 3.5 m , and tng 3.6 m telescopes .",
    "all five objects are two - image lensed quasars , with image separations of 128404 . the source redshifts range from 2.24 to 3.63 .",
    "the lens redshift of sdss  j0819 + 5356 is measured to be @xmath2 from the h&k absorption lines , whereas the lens redshifts of the other four objects are estimated to be 0.20.8 from the colors and magnitudes of the lensing galaxies .",
    "the image configurations and fluxes of all the lenses are well reproduced by standard lens models .",
    "we find signatures of strong external shears for sdss  j1258 + 1657 and sdss  j1339 + 1310 , presumably coming from nearby galaxies whose redshifts are estimated to be similar to that of the lensing galaxy .    the statistical lensed quasar sample of the sqls is restricted to @xmath13 , and therefore all the lensed quasars discovered here",
    "will not be included in the sqls statistical sample .",
    "the reason is that the sdss quasars at @xmath18 are selected only from point sources and therefore the sdss - selected quasars have a strong bias against our `` morphological selection '' . thus the five lenses will be included in a statistical sample when a homogeneous catalog with quasars at @xmath18 is constructed .",
    "however , the five lenses will definitely be useful for detailed future studies , such as deep spectroscopy for the lensing galaxies to measure their redshifts and velocity dispersions and for the quasar images to study the transverse structure in the ly@xmath28 forest , and high - resolution imaging to see the structure of the systems .",
    "in addition , monitoring observations to measure time delays and microlensing events will provide useful opportunities to study the central structures of the quasars and to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "these high - redshift quasar lenses will also be important to extend the redshift range of the lens applications ; only about 30 objects out of the @xmath14100 lensed quasars are identified to be lenses at @xmath18 .",
