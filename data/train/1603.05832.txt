    "tidal disruption events ( tde ) of stars by massive black holes @xcite provide one of the ways to detect an inactive massive black hole in the center of a galaxy . stars whose orbit brings them too close to a black hole can be disrupted and a large fraction of their mass can be accreted .",
    "this sudden accretion event is expected to produce a luminous uv and x - ray tde flare @xcite .",
    "it has recently been argued that tdes can also produce jets @xcite .",
    "these jets are expected to be detectable due to their non - thermal emission , and in radio they are likely to appear as transients that peak on the timescales of about a year @xcite after the tidal disruption",
    ".    swift j1644 + 57 ( swj1644 in the rest of the article ) is a non - thermal transient detected on march 28th.2011 @xcite .",
    "it is thought to be prototype of a jetted tde ( jtde ) .",
    "its radio emission @xcite is long - lived and complex .",
    "one of the first attempts to explain the radio emission of swift j1644 + 57 using one - dimensional models and relativistic hydrodynamic simulations@xcite assumed that the emission is coming from the shocks that form when the jet interacts with the circumnuclear medium ( cnm ) .",
    "this model is more analogous to a grb afterglow than to an agn .",
    "while the model was successful in explaining the first few weeks of swj1644 radio emission , it turns out that the long - term emission is not easily accounted for by a radio afterglow from a single ultrarelativistic , narrow jet .",
    "the reason for this is that the source rebrightened after @xmath0 days , the time at which the afterglow model predicted a steady decline ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  1 ) .",
    "the late time rebrightening implies that additional energy is injected in the external shock months after the burst@xcite .",
    "this may happen if , for instance , the jtde is accompanied by a powerful mildly relativistic component@xcite .",
    "in this contribution we focus on the numerical and technical aspects of jtde modeling . in section  [ sec : num ] we describe the numerical codes used in the calculations and how they depend on each other .",
    "the section  [ sec : sim ] gives an overview of computational requirements and their consequences on the kind of models that we were able to produce .",
    "the discussion and summary is given in the section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "swj1644 is a distant object ( its redsfhit is @xmath1 @xcite ) , and is thus too small to be resolved in great detail .",
    "thus , the only direct observations that we have are the total fluxes for different times and frequencies ( i.e. , multiwavelength light curves ) .",
    "nevertheless , when simulating this source we need to construct a detailed , resolved model of the swj1644 jet , simulate its dynamics , compute its resolved emission , and only in the final stage integrate the resolved emission to compute the total flux to be compared to observations . in order to achieve this",
    "we use two numerical codes so that the output of the first code ( _ mrgenesis _ ) is used as an input to the second one ( _ spev _ ) .",
    "the former simulates the jet dynamics , while the latter computes its emission .",
    "_ mrgenesis _ is a code developed to solve the equations of relativistic numerical ( magneto ) hydrodynamics _ in the laboratory frame ( i.e. , a frame at rest with respect to the _ distant source_)_. the code is massively parallelized using mpi and openmp librararies , and uses the parallel hdf5 library for file input and output .",
    "we employ a method of lines for our simulations in which the spatial reconstruction is a based on the third order ppm reconstruction routines@xcite , and the time update is performed by means of a third order tvd runge - kutta scheme@xcite .",
    "numerical fluxes are evaluated with the marquina flux formula@xcite .",
    "we simulate swj1644 in two dimensions assuming axisymmetry and discretize the computational domain using spherical coordinates .",
    "the black hole is assumed to be located at the origin and the tde occurs at scales that are much smaller than the ones we consider in our work ( we simulate neither the tde nor the jet launching ) .",
    "we set the beginning of the numerical grid at @xmath2 cm .",
    "the jet is injected through the inner boundary in an angular interval @xmath3 $ ] , assuming a constant lorentz factor @xmath4 , and a luminosity whose time dependence is @xmath5^{-5/3}$ ] .",
    "@xmath6 is the time during which the jet luminosity is constant , and the peak lumiosity @xmath7 is computed from the total jtde energy @xmath8 through @xmath9 .",
    "the jet interacts with a cnm that is assumed to be at rest with a density profile @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the proton mass , @xmath12 is the particle number density at @xmath13 cm and @xmath14 is the power - law index of the density profile .",
    "we assume that initially both the jet and the external medium are cold . during the simulation we periodically store the snapshots of the computational grid in order to obtain a sufficient coverage of the jet - cnm interaction to be able to compute the resulting emission with sufficient precision ( see section  [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "once the relativistic hydrodynamics simulation has finished , the snapshots it produced are used by the code _ spev _ to compute the emission .",
    "the spatial distribution of the hydrodynamics variables needs to be stored with sufficient frequency because of the space - time transformations that need to be performed to compute the observable radiation in the ( distant ) _ observer frame_. _ _ spev__@xcite is designed to process an arbitrary number of pre - computed sets of hydrodynamic states of the fluid ( i.e. , density , pressure , positions , velocities , magnetic field ) and to compute the resulting non - thermal emission .",
    "the procedure can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "* injection * : _ spev _ uses a set of lagrangian particles ( lps ) as a representation of the emitting volumes .",
    "each lp has a defined position , shape and velocity .",
    "attached to it there is a representation of the non - thermal electron ( nte ) energy distribution . in _",
    ", new lps are created each time a snapshot is processed .",
    "the position of the shock fronts that form as a consequence of the jet - cnm interaction is detected , and lps are injected into the shocked fluid immediately behind the front . since the actual process of particle acceleration occurs on temporal and spatial scales far below the ones we are able to simulate ( see e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , we use a phenomenological model to link the fluid state with nte distribution .",
    "the model we use is a standard one @xcite : the energy contained in the ntes and in the stochastic magnetic field are assumed to be fractions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the shocked fluid thermal energy .",
    "the injection spectrum is assumed to be a power - law in energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the power - law index and @xmath19 is the nte lorentz factor .",
    "we determine the normalization and energy cutoffs of the distribution using a numerical procedure described in detail in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of @xcite .",
    "transport , evolution and emission * : as it processes the snapshots , _ spev _ transports the injected lps , assuming that after they have been injected they move with the fluid .",
    "an exception are the newly injected lps : between the snapshot in which the particle is injected and the subsequent one the two edges parallel to the shock front are assumed to move with different velocities ( one with the velocity of the shocked fluid and the other one with the faster velocity of the shock front ) .",
    "this ensures that new lps correctly represent the increase in the volume due to newly shocked fluid , regardless of the numerical resolution or the frequency with which snapshots are stored .",
    "simultaneously , the nte energy losses due to synchrotron radiation , as well as the energy gains(losses ) due to adiabatic compression(expansion ) are taken into account : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the time , fluid density , magnetic field energy density and external radiation field energy density ( all measured in the lp frame ) .",
    "section  3.2 of @xcite describes an efficient numerical algorithm for solving eq .",
    "[ eq : losses ] for each nte distribution in each lp .",
    "at the same time that the particles are evolved , their non - thermal emission is computed ( see section  4 of @xcite for a description of an efficient numerical algorithm for computing synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients , and section  a.2.1 of the same paper for a description of the way particles in two - dimensional axisymmetric models can be used to represent three - dimensional emitting volumes ) .",
    "the coefficients computed in this step are stored in a global array that is used in the final step .",
    "3 .   * solving the radiative transfer equation * : after all the snapshots have been processed and the emission from all lps has been computed for all times , the time- and frequency - dependent emission can be computed .",
    "we assume that there is a virtual screen ( `` virtual detector '' , vd ) located in front of the source , and the goal is to compute the intensity in each of the virtual pixels of the vd .",
    "this is done by solving the radiative transfer equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the specific intensity , emissivity and absorption coefficient .",
    "@xmath29 is the distance along the line of sight from the jet to a particular pixel and it relates the simulation time @xmath21 to the time of observation @xmath30 by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the distance from the vd to the source . in other words , for a given @xmath30 and @xmath21 , @xmath29 is the distance of a lp from which radiation is observed at time @xmath30 if that lp is emitting at a time @xmath21 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "[ eq : intens ] needs to be solved in such a way that @xmath29 is monotonously increasing from the jet towards the vd .",
    "therefore , after all the snapshots have been processed , the emission and absorption coefficients need to be sorted according to their @xmath29 and then eq .  [ eq : intens ] is solved for each pixel .    in practice",
    "the positions of lps in steps ( i ) and ( ii ) are stored in a set of ( large ) intermediate files ( `` preprocessor '' files ) .",
    "a postprocessor executes the radiation part of step ( ii ) by reading the preprocessor files and storing the coefficients in memory .",
    "after all preprocessor files have been postprocessed , the step ( iii ) is executed .",
    "both preprocessor and postprocessor parts of _ spev _ are paralellized using openmp .",
    "the postprocessor , in particular , needs to be run on a machine with enough shared memory because all information produced in step 2 needs to be held in memory for the step 3 to correctly compute the intensities .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : hydro ] , we model swj1644 jet in two - dimensions .",
    "however , as will be explained in this section , the total cost in terms of computing time , disk storage and working memory of each two - dimensional simulation is high .",
    "therefore , we first perform a number of much less costly tests using a one - dimensional approximation to two - dimensional models . the goal of those tests is to determine the values of a number of the parameters of the numerical simulation for which the results are satisfactory .",
    "afterward , the two - dimensional simulations are performed using the values determined in one - dimensional tests .      using _ mrgenesis _",
    "we simulate one - dimensional spherically symmetric jets . for the purpose of computing their emission with _",
    "spev _ we assume that their opening angles are @xmath33 .",
    "we fix all the physical parameters of the jet ( @xmath34 erg , @xmath35 , @xmath36 rad , @xmath37 s ) and of the external medium ( @xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",

    "since each of the lps has to be converted to a three - dimensional emitting volume , it may contribute to multiple vd pixels and also to multiple observing times , we soon realized that the realistic upper limit of @xmath76 tbyte of ram on our shared memory machine would not be enough to compute off - axis images at full resolution .",
    "a remedy to this problem was to artificially reduce the angular resolution when preprocessing the hydrodynamic snapshots by a factor of @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( this would roughly correspond going from the second - best to third- of fourth - best angular resolution in top left panel in figure  [ fig : var1d ] . ) .",
    "this reduces the number of emitting volumes so that even off - axis radiative transfer calculations could be performed .      for the purposes of the numerical tests we computed the on - axis light curves ( in complete analogy to the tests presented in section  [ sec:1d ] ) .",

    "we show all the contributions to the emission at @xmath79 seconds and at 15.4ghz .",
    "the data shown originates from lps emitting at different times from different positions ( the lower the value of @xmath80 the earlier the lp had to emit for it to be observed at @xmath81 seconds ) . in other words ,",
    "what is shown does not correspond to one particular snapshot of the jet evolution .",
    "nevertheless , we know that the edge of the emitting region corresponds to the position of the bow shock of the jet .",
    "we also see in the bottom right panel in figure  [ fig : observer ] that a small region behind the shock is optically thin and most of the contribution to the emission comes from this region and from the surface at which the emission becomes optically thin ( the transition between light and dark blue regions ) .",
    "using this type of analysis it is possible to understand , among other things , why the inverse compton cooling of the electrons is not very efficient at low frequencies ( though it may be important for higher frequency observations of swj1644 , see @xcite ) : the electrons cool after being accelerated by the shock , but since they are advected behind it , once they enter the opaque region ( dark blue ) , they stop contributing to the observed emission .",

    "4 .   for each @xmath90 , independently re - compute the radio image by limiting the vd to the rectangle computed in the previous step , but using the resolution @xmath92 .",
    "the above procedure enables us to compute the emission from early times without numerical artifacts times smaller than in the lower panels , but all are computed using the same vd resolution . ] .",
    "the tradeoff is that we need to postprocess the intermediate files multiple times : once in step ( ii ) and then additional @xmath94 times in step ( iv ) .",
    "the computing time does not necessarily scale as @xmath94 since , for each @xmath90 , the emission and absorption coefficients are only computed from those emitting volumes that contribute to the emission , while the rest ( typically corresponding to most of the volume of the model ) are ignored .",
    "this is made efficient by indexing the intermediate files . for a given observing angle the calculations at @xmath95 different observing frequencies last @xmath96 days .",
    "in this contribution we have discussed the technical details of the one and two dimensional simulations of the swj1644 jet . in section  [ sec : num ] we explain in detail how the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations are coupled to the radiative transfer code to produce the synthetic observations ( light curves ) that can be directly compared to the observations . in section  [ sec:1d ] we show that many one - dimensional tests can be used to probe the sensitivity of the computed light curves on the resolution of the hydrodynamic simulations , on the frequency of stored snapshots , on the resolution of the discretization in energy space and of the virtual detector . the results obtained helped to determine the resolution of the two dimensional simulation so that its computational cost is acceptable , but also so that the final light curves are as free of numerical artifacts as possible .",

    "<S> in this work we focus on the technical details of the numerical simulations of the non - thermal transient swift j1644 + 57 , whose emission is probably produced by a two - component jet powered by a tidal disruption event . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we provide details of the coupling between the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and the radiative transfer code . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the technical demands of one - dimensional simulations of a fast relativistic jet , and show to what extent ( for the same physical parameters of the model ) do the computed light curves depend on the numerical parameters of the different codes employed . in the second part </S>",
    "<S> we explain the difficulties of computing light curves from axisymmetric two dimensonal simulations and discuss a procedure that yields an acceptable tradeoff between the computational cost and the quality of the results . </S>"
