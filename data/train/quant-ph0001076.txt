    "several measures of entanglement @xcite or quantum correlations have been proposed : some are associated with the preparation of the state , others with the process of purification or distillation @xcite and yet others with the notion of mutual information or relative entropy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we wish to suggest another measure , based on covariance , in which the acts of state creation and observation are considered in a dual manner .    in practice",
    "it is very natural to describe the condition of the system ( its method of preparation or lack of it ) in terms of a density matrix which is tied to the subsequent observations on it .",
    "this is how the linkage between observer and observed occurs quantum mechanically , and of course the results are expressed in terms of traces over appropriate functions of the density matrix and of the operators being measured @xcite .",
    "indeed mermin @xcite has taken that view that the density matrix , and the correlations between observables which thereby ensue , constitute _ all _ of physical reality .    in this paper",
    "we will also focus on the density matrix . because binning of observations is a necessity in practice ,",
    "the dimension of the density matrix is thereby determined : @xmath0 separate bins produce a density matrix @xmath1 that is an @xmath2 hermitian matrix , satisfying the usual hermiticity and trace conditions . in this way",
    ", we can regard the basis as an @xmath0-level system , rather like a particle of angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "hence , although we might be studying the probability distribution of an observable which actually possesses a continuous spectrum , we can still regard it as a spin - like system ; in practical terms , the bigger the binning number @xmath0 , the greater the precision of the information about the continuous variable , but obviously @xmath0 is _",
    "never infinite_. for spin measurements , we need not go to such pains because @xmath0 is fixed for us at the start .    with the focus on density matrices , we will carry out measurements ( without mutual interference ) on two subsystems , 1 and 2 say , so their corresponding observables , superscripted by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , are commuting operators .",
    "the system will be separable @xcite or `` disentangled '' if the larger density matrix @xmath1 is merely a direct product of density matrices associated with the two subsystems , or @xmath4 ; a particular case arises when the initial or prepared state is the direct product of two subsystem states , @xmath5 . when two subsystems are disentangled , the results of measuring any quantity @xmath6 in the first subsystem are not tied to the results of measuring any quantity @xmath7 in the second subsystem ; necessarily @xmath8 for all choices of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , if @xmath11 , the configuration is non - factorizable and the covariance , @xmath12 no longer disappears .",
    "the real issue is how to quantify the entanglement or lack of factorizability @xcite of the larger density matrix .",
    "several proposals have been advanced in the literature , but none of them is entirely simple or definitive @xcite .",
    "however all researchers in this field seem to agree on the following three conditions for an entanglement measure @xmath13 :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 iff @xmath1 is separable , ie if the density matrix can be written as @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   local unitary transformations should leave @xmath13 invariant .",
    "3 .   @xmath13 should not increase under local measurement and classical communication procedures , we intuitively know that such procedures can not add non - locality characteristics to the system being measured .    as an extra requirement",
    ", it would be nice if @xmath13 gave some indication of the extent of violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to put forward a concrete scheme for quantifying correlations between two subsystems and their possible entanglement .",
    "the scheme is based on a generalization of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and particular choices of operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are readily applicable and rooted in the density matrix notion . in the next section",
    "we discuss several matters connected with non - separability of states and their influence on subsequent subsystem measurements . because we deal with practical observations ,",
    "the density matrix is truly discrete and we can assume that the elements of the vector space on which it lives have equal weight . as already mentioned , one may regard the dimension @xmath16 as corresponding to a `` spin system '' , with each component _ carrying equal weight _ , and can adopt the same stance for the subsystem dimensions @xmath17 .",
    "( this restriction can be relaxed if the components have unequal weights , such as atomic energy levels at a _",
    "finite _ temperature . )    the next section deals with the generalities of simultaneous measurements and their covariance properties @xcite .",
    "this is followed by our suggestion for quantifying entanglement of two subsystems within a larger entity , which is shown to be consistent with normal expectations for two spin 1/2 subsystems , when @xmath18 .",
    "we also discuss the use of total spin dispersion @xcite as another measure of entanglement , with an allied appendix concerning the majorana - penrose @xcite representation of spin states on the poincar sphere .",
    "the subsequent sections deal with entanglement measures for larger value of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally we discuss general questions pertaining to our suggested measure ; these include rovelli s notion that information in quantum mechanics is relational @xcite , mermin s notions of correlations between local observables @xcite , and the difference between our modified correlation measure with classical correlations for impure states .",
    "elementary texts on quantum mechanics teach us that the results of all physical measurements and processes can be tied to the evaluation of traces of products of observables with the hermitian density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "thus statistical formulae like @xmath21 etc .",
    "are part of the standard repertoire . of course , the @xmath1-eigenvalues lie between 0 and 1 ; in the latter case we are dealing with a pure state when the density matrix reduces to a projector @xmath22 , while the most random situation @xmath23 corresponds to the case of maximum entropy .",
    "the covariance for any two commuting observables @xmath24 in a mixed state @xmath1 is defined as @xmath25 clearly , @xmath26 .",
    "less well - known is the fact that pure state dispersions and correlations can be neatly expressed in terms of a single trace . consider the quantity @xmath27[b,\\rho])/2 =   { \\rm tr}(\\rho^2\\{a , b\\}/2 - \\rho a\\rho b),\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are _ any _ two operators .",
    "this quantity will be referred to as the _ alternative covariance_.[b,\\rho][c,\\rho]\\right)=0 $ ] , etc . ]",
    "we now present some elementary results about @xmath28 which follow simply from this definition :    1 .",
    "@xmath29 , where @xmath30 are any two constants . 2",

    "3 .   @xmath32 4 .",
    "@xmath33 5 .",
    "@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is any unitary transformation .",
    "thus a change of basis for the state is equivalent to an inverse change of basis for the operators .",
    "6 .   @xmath36 .",
    "this follows by considering the operator @xmath37 $ ] , with @xmath38[a^{\\dag},\\rho])/{\\rm tr}([\\rho , a][b^{\\dag},\\rho],$ ] and noting that @xmath39 7 .",
    "@xmath40 is _",
    "real_. 8 .",
    "@xmath41 is symmetrical under interchange , conjugation and change of phase of the two operators .",
    "all of these properties are shared by the usual covariance cov@xmath42 .",
    "nevertheless , alternative covariance @xmath28 does not provide an indication of variance and covariance in the usual sense .",
    "for instance , if the state is one of maximum entropy , on the one hand we have @xmath43 for all @xmath44 because @xmath1 is proportional to unity ; on the other hand , the @xmath45 need not vanish .",
    "some special cases for the operators @xmath44 can now be studied .    1 .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 commute , @xmath46 2 .   if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both hermitian , @xmath47 becomes real .",
    "3 .   if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both unitary , @xmath48 likewise for @xmath10 . since @xmath36",
    ", it follows that @xmath49    more particular cases arise when the system is prepared in a pure state @xmath50 , so that @xmath1 becomes a projection operator and @xmath51 reduces to @xmath52=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath53 this is in keeping with the familiar variance - covariance inequality : @xmath54 if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are commuting _ unitary _ operators and because @xmath55 we see that alternative covariance only attains a value of 1 for pure states .",
    "it is worthwhile comparing the two covariance functions , in relation to two commuting observables , @xmath24 . since @xmath56=0 $ ] ,",
    "select an orthonormal basis @xmath57 wherein the operators are simultaneously diagonalised , so @xmath58 then @xmath59 and similarly @xmath60 since @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore note that @xmath62 upon symmetrising the sums , we obtain the neater expressions , @xmath63 @xmath64 whilst the ordinary covariance has a clear meaning ",
    "namely , a measure of the correlations between the results of local measurements @xmath9 and @xmath10 that commute  the interpretation of the alternative covariance is less obvious .    we can obtain more insight by choosing @xmath65 . since @xmath1 is a positive definite hermitian operator , @xmath66 , for any two states @xmath67 .",
    "therefore for a general ( mixed state ) density matrix , @xmath68 or @xmath69    in the light of the variance inequality above it is natural to ask whether @xmath70 is true .",
    "in fact a single ( but carefully chosen ) counterexample suffices to show that it is false : in local bases @xmath71 for two local operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 , take @xmath74 and select the local operators to be diagonal , @xmath75 evaluation of the two types of covariance leads to @xmath76 thus the variance inequality can not be extended to covariance .",
    "however , an immediate consequence of the inequality , var@xmath77 , is that when var@xmath78 , @xmath79 too for any observable @xmath9 .",
    "but @xmath80[a,\\rho]^{\\dag})$ ] ; so @xmath81=0 $ ] , which means that @xmath1 is purely in an eigenstate of @xmath9 .",
    "this accords with the basic tenets of quantum mechanics of course .",
    "the contrapositive of this result is that if @xmath81\\neq 0 $ ] , then @xmath82 .",
    "another worthwhile comment stems from the observation that if @xmath83 is conjugate to @xmath9 in the sense @xmath84 = i\\hbar$ ] , then @xmath85[\\rho , a]^{\\dag}\\right)=\\hbar^2{\\rm tr }   \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}^{\\dag }    \\right).\\ ] ] thus , @xmath86 with equality only applying to pure states .",
    "for example , the energy uncertainty is given by @xmath87 , while the momentum uncertainty is given by the derivative of the density matrix with respect to position : @xmath88 , and so on .",
    "for a general mixed configuration , the two inequalities , @xmath89 together with the well - known\\]]var_(a)var_(b )    any two operators , whether or not they commute . for instance,\\]]var_(x).var_(p )    operators @xmath24 , for which there exist states such that @xmath90 and also other states for which @xmath91 .",
    "hence _ both _ inequalities must be considered jointly in an examination of the minimum of the variance product , together with heisenberg s well - known lower bound , @xmath92)|/2 $ ] .",
    "this section examines the correlation properties of the entanglement of two subsystems in a tensor product hilbert space @xmath93 . by definition",
    ", measurements can be carried out without mutual interference on the two subsystems so their corresponding observables , superscripted by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , are commuting operators . as mentioned in the introduction , a state of the system is factorisable or disentangled if the larger density matrix @xmath1 is merely a direct product of density matrices associated with the two subsystems , or @xmath94 .",
    "for any two local operators @xmath95 , it is easy to show that the covariance disappears : @xmath96 this includes the case of a pure disentangled state , @xmath97 .",
    "having noted that the covariance is non - zero in disentangled states , we now refer to the conditions imposed upon any measure of entanglement .",
    "the second condition is that it be invariant under local unitary transformations . with this in mind , define the _ covariance entanglement _ for pure states as latexmath:[\\[e_{a^{(1)},b^{(2)}}(\\rho ) \\equiv",
    "\\max_{u = u^{(1)}\\otimes u^{(2 ) } }     clearly be invariant under additional local unitary transformations .    since the operation of permuting the elements of a hilbert space is unitary",
    ", all elements of the hilbert spaces are equally important .",
    "for this reason , it is natural to select the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 so as to equally weight the elements of the hilbert space .",
    "the next section describes several ideas for achieving this , starting with the simplest case .",
    "this section investigates a method for quantifying pure state entanglement in the simplest possible non - trivial case , corresponding to two spin 1/2 systems , with hilbert space @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a local hilbert space , with orthonormal basis @xmath101 and so @xmath102    next consider the pure ( normalized but arbitrary ) state , @xmath103 working out cov@xmath42 in this state , it is straightforward to show that the covariance is maximised provided that @xmath104 , or @xmath105 .",
    "thus one may take the four independent bell states , @xmath106/\\sqrt{2},\\quad    |0 0\\rangle \\equiv [ |ud\\rangle - |du\\rangle]/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] @xmath107/\\sqrt{2},\\quad    |1 -\\rangle \\equiv [ |uu\\rangle - |dd\\rangle]/\\sqrt{2},\\ ] ] as the ones that have the largest covariance .",
    "( these pure states are also known to be the most entangled ones . )",
    "of course they are all local unitary transforms of just one of them , say the bell state , @xmath108 , with a corresponding @xmath109 .",
    "if one rotates the operators @xmath24 _ together _ about the `` @xmath110-axis '' by the same amount , we can get a good idea of how the covariance varies with rotation angle ; maximization is attained when the angle is @xmath111 .",
    "see figure [ covariancefigure ] .",
    "if a pure state is disentangled , then there is an orientation of the local @xmath6 which has zero variance . to see this ,",
    "rotate the state by local unitary transformations until the reduced density matrix for the local operator in question is diagonalised .",
    "since the initial state was pure and disentangled , then it may be represented by a separable projector @xmath112 , in which both reduced density matrices are projectors .",
    "thus the main diagonals of @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be reduced to a single 1 , with 0s elsewhere .",
    "hence for diagonalised local operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 in this basis , @xmath115 so the variances vanishes . figure [ variancefigure ] illustrates the behaviour of the variance in a 2-variable parametrisation . the horizontal axis variable @xmath116 parametrises a set of pure states which range from disentangled to a maximally entangled bell state , and back to disentangled again , i.e. @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "the second variable @xmath110 parametrises @xmath110-axis rotations of the local spin basis ( 1 ) associated with @xmath9 alone .    these results may be applied to actual spin measurements . if one knows that a state is pure , but is not certain of the degree of entanglement , local spin measurements can be made in a variety of directions .",
    "if the variance and covariance of these measurements vanishes in a pure state , then the state must be disentangled .",
    "many different choices of local operators @xmath120 are possible , and different choices will lead to different behaviour of the covariance . however before considering two sensible choices , let us note that for @xmath121 , one of the maximally entangled states can be taken to be the state of total spin @xmath122 , while minimally entangled states are @xmath123 and zero entanglement equates with minimal dispersion @xmath124 , where * @xmath125 * stands for total spin .",
    "this suggests that for higher spin , some maximally entangled states might be found by minimising the total angular momentum dispersion and vice versa .",
    "this approach towards quantifying entanglement is quite interesting in its own right and is pursued in appendix a , where we also tie it to the majorana - penrose pictorial view of spin . in appendix b , by contrast , we classify any measure of entanglement via an integrity basis for density matrix invariants .      consider two - system hilbert spaces where the local spaces may each have dimension greater than 2 .",
    "select local operators @xmath126 , where @xmath24 may be expressed in their respective local bases as unitary transformations of the following diagonal matrix , @xmath127 next , maximise the covariance over all such unitarily - transformed matrices ; the result is perforce invariant under local unitary transformations of the state . labelling the local bases",
    "@xmath128 and @xmath129 respectively , where @xmath130 runs from 1 to @xmath0 , operators like the above discriminate between pairs of elements in a local subspace of the full hilbert space , and treat terms of the form @xmath131 as the basic element of entanglement or @xmath10 with @xmath132 or @xmath133 ; this makes the operator @xmath35 unitary , which means that its variance is simply @xmath134 .",
    "however the distribution of the @xmath135 eigenvalues is not self - evident , except for the spin @xmath136 spin@xmath137 case . ] .",
    "since we wish to handle all the subsystem states democratically , let us define an equal weight local unitary operator as consisting of some unitary transformation of a diagonal matrix comprising the @xmath0-th roots of unity .",
    "( note that these matrices are not hermitian when @xmath138 and can not correspond to observables . ) here the local weight unitary matrices in their corresponding diagonalising basis , up to an overall phase , are given by @xmath139 only for the spin @xmath137 @xmath140 spin @xmath137 case , do these operators correspond exactly to the pairwise local unitary operators used previously .",
    "the next nontrivial case is @xmath141 , or spin 1 @xmath140 spin 1 . in this case",
    "one can see that all states which are local unitary transformations of the pure state @xmath142 have a maximal covariance of 1 . to understand why , rotate the equal - weight unitary operators so that the local states @xmath143 and @xmath144 produce eigenvalues which are respectively conjugate pairs .",
    "this yields @xmath145 .",
    "however , @xmath146 , so the maximised covariance is 1 .",
    "what of other states , such as @xmath147 when @xmath141 ?",
    "the following theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to exhibit @xmath148 , with respect to these equal weight operators and is in agreement with all other pure state entanglement measures .",
    "* theorem : * _ the only pure states which attain the maximised covariance of 1 under equal - weight local operators are states which are local unitary transformations of @xmath149 .",
    "any other states exhibit smaller correlations .",
    "_    * proof : * in a tensor product space @xmath150 , consider the state @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 , and the orthonormal bases @xmath154 are a complete set of eigenstates for the diagonalised equal - weight unitary operators @xmath120 , with eigenvalues @xmath155 respectively . recalling the result for such @xmath120 that @xmath156 we see that a maximised covariance of 1 is only attainable in a state where @xmath157 , whereupon the covariance reduces to @xmath158 in what cases is this expression maximised , subject to the condition that the mean values of the operators remain zero ?",
    "we are seeking to maximise @xmath159 subject to @xmath160 by the triangle inequality , @xmath161 where equality holds at every stage only if all the complex numbers @xmath162 have equal and opposite phase .",
    "this means that we are pairing @xmath163 such that non - zero @xmath164 ( only for @xmath165 ) are associated in a one - to - one manner with @xmath166 for all such pairs , otherwise the parallelism of the complex numbers will be lost .",
    "this will ensure that @xmath167 at the same time we have to guarantee that the average values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 vanish or @xmath168 . since @xmath169 , a",
    "_ sufficient _",
    "condition for this is that for all such pairs , the weightings are equal or @xmath170 ; in other words every @xmath171 and its corresponding @xmath172 only occurs at most once in the terms with equal non - zero weighting .",
    "( actually one may introduce an arbitrary phase into @xmath173 without affecting this conclusion , but we have chosen not to do so . )    having established that the states which maximise the covariance can take the form @xmath174 , we should point out that it is not necessary for _ all _ the terms to be paired up .",
    "consider the case @xmath175 , or spin @xmath176 spin @xmath177 systems , with bases @xmath178 and @xmath179 respectively .",
    "it is possible to attain maximised covariances of 1 under the equal - weight measures _ both _ for @xmath180 and for @xmath181 .",
    "this is achieved by choosing eigenvalues so that @xmath182 and yet pick eigenvalues such that the values of @xmath183 in the states @xmath184 are all 1 .",
    "as we are in a 4-dimensional space , we can achieve this by taking the eigenvalue sets @xmath185 and @xmath186 for both operators on both states @xmath50 and @xmath187 respectively .",
    "this observation means that the ` equal - weight ' @xmath188-based measures for @xmath189 are not measures of entanglement , under the standard criteria .",
    "information - based entanglement measures , such as the relative entropy , specify that @xmath50 is less entangled than @xmath187 .",
    "it appears that the covariance - based measures of entanglement are most useful when dealing with spin @xmath136 spin@xmath137 systems , since in this case there is no ambiguity as to the choice of eigenvalues .",
    "similarly for operators of prime dimension , such ambiguities are absent , because there is only one way to arrive at a maximally correlated state : the non - uniqueness only pertains to composite - dimensional local spaces .",
    "the above result demonstrates that for pure states , the reduced density matrices must be diagonalised in order to maximise the covariance of the diagonalised local unitary operators .",
    "however , for mixed states it is not at all obvious that the reduced density matrices must be diagonalised in order to maximise the unitary matrix covariance .",
    "this issue will will be examined in section 4 .      for spaces of differing dimension , such as spin @xmath191 spin @xmath192 ,",
    "the covariance of the pairwise operators behave just as in the other cases . however ,",
    "if the equal - weight local operators are used , covariances of 1 are _ not attainable_. this reflects the fact that the bases have different sizes , and so there is no way to pair up elements between the bases in a one - to - one manner so as to produce a set of product eigenvalues with the same phase .",
    "the simplest example which exhibits this effect is a spin @xmath193 spin @xmath132 space , with equal - weight operators @xmath194 as with the proof that the states of maximum covariance are @xmath195 , a covariance of 1 is only attainable if @xmath196 ; we also need the complex numbers @xmath197 to have the same phase ( where the state has schmidt decomposition @xmath198 in the basis of eigenvalues of the operators @xmath120 ) .",
    "following similar arguments to those used in the proof , it is not possible to choose @xmath164 so that the direction condition is satisfied ; this is because no repetitions of @xmath171 or @xmath199 values can occur in the set of non - zero @xmath164 , since the resulting @xmath200 would not have the same phase .",
    "but it is not possible to partially pair up the given set of eigenvalues so that the directions of the products are the same , by straightforward enumeration of the cases .",
    "thus states in this basis can not attain covariances of @xmath132 .",
    "clearly many other local operators can be defined which provide a variety of different correlation measures for two - system states but none stands out .",
    "making a distinction between quantum and classical correlations has proved a thorny problem in the study of quantum entanglement .",
    "the nature of the problem may be seen when comparing the two states , one pure and one mixed , which possess the same covariance for @xmath201 : @xmath202 the first state is a bell state and is maximally entangled , whilst the second state is a mixture of disentangled projectors , and is normally regarded as being disentangled . as both states exhibit correlations ,",
    "it is natural to ask whether the alternative covariance introduced in section 2 provides a way of distinguishing between classical and quantum correlations .",
    "take any two commuting local measurements , @xmath204 , and define the function @xmath205 where the maximum is now taken over all local unitary transformations of the general _ mixed _ density matrix @xmath1 . in previous sections we investigated the behaviour of this function for pure states ( when @xmath28 reduces to the covariance ) , and found that it appeared to have many of the properties desirable in a pure state entanglement measure .",
    "the situation where the density matrix corresponds to an impure configuration is more intriguing .",
    "shown below is a comparison of the behaviour of the two maximised covariance entanglement measures , in several example configurations , which illustrate the distinction between @xmath206 and @xmath207 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the illustrative state @xmath208 is pure but entangled , @xmath209 is factorizable and therefore disentangled , while the matrix @xmath210 is not factorizable but can be expressed as a sum of separable projectors ; therefore @xmath210 should represent a disentangled configuration , according to standard expectations . by inspecting the table",
    "we see that cov@xmath211 , being nonzero , is not a good entanglement measure @xmath13 , but the alternative @xmath212 is better in that it does vanish .",
    "the alternative covariance @xmath188 in mixed states is bounded above by @xmath213 , so the state must be pure to obtain a covariance of 1 under local unitary transformations .",
    "another point worth remembering is that for configurations of maximum entropy where @xmath214 and commutes with all operators , @xmath188 is automatically zero .",
    "figures [ mixedparametrisation1 ] and [ mixedparametrisation2 ] depict the squares of the equal weight classical covariance and alternative covariance of a parametrised mixture of different bell states .",
    "they show that both covariance measures attain a maximum of 1 only for the pure states , and that the behaviour of these functions depends upon the kind of bell - states involved in the mixtures .",
    "\\(i ) @xmath215",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath216    \\(i ) @xmath215    \\(ii ) @xmath216    for _ any _ choice of @xmath120 , a maximised @xmath212 of zero occurs for many mixed configuration @xmath1 which are disentangled , according to the standard definition of a mixed state , such as the states of maximum entropy with @xmath214 .",
    "this behaviour of the alternative covariance for ` partially entangled ' configurations is what one would naively expect for a mixed configuration entanglement measure @xmath13 .",
    "however , there is a particular class of mixed states which are disentangled according to the commonly accepted definition of a mixed state , whilst exhibiting non - zero alternative covariance properties .",
    "this section assesses the alternative covariance as a measure of entanglement , according to the principles outlined by vedral and plenio@xcite .",
    "firstly , consider the cases where a state exhibits zero quantum correlation .",
    "a mixed configuration is usually defined to be separable if it can be written as a sum of separable projectors ; thus @xmath217 then for any such @xmath1 , @xmath218 which is guaranteed to vanish if the @xmath219 are projectors .",
    "now consider cases where the density matrix is a mixture like latexmath:[\\[\\half    here , it can be shown that these mixtures produce non - zero @xmath51 , because their expansion into projector traces may be used to extract off - diagonal elements of observables @xmath24 in suitable local bases .",
    "take for instance the two local operators on separate spin @xmath137 bases , @xmath221 , which is a unitary transformations of the equal - weight matrix , @xmath222 used previously .",
    "the terms in the expansion of @xmath188 above are non - vanishing only if non - parallel , non - orthogonal projectors are used .",
    "thus we evaluate the two non - vanishing terms , with local projectors @xmath223 giving @xmath224",
    "@xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227 these terms do not cancel , and the other two terms in the expansion are zero , so the alternative covariance @xmath28 is non - zero even though we are dealing with a disentangled state , according to the usual terminology .    from this we deduce that the measure @xmath228 based on alternative covariance is _ not _ a measure of entanglement ( according to the conditions provided by vedral and plenio ) , when mixed states are encountered , since it violates the first condition for such measures .",
    "the third condition on entanglement measures proposed by vedral and plenio is that the entanglement of a state should not increase under the three types of purification processes ( lgm , cc , and ps ) .",
    "let us consider all possible lgm , cc and ps measurement operations which act on a disentangled state @xmath229 and yield states which exhibit non - zero quantum covariance @xmath212 , such as @xmath230 the change from @xmath231 to @xmath210 may be performed by the classically correlated set of local measurements @xmath232 , where @xmath233 together with @xmath234 which have @xmath235 in place of @xmath236 .",
    "thus @xmath237 , and @xmath238 , so this represents a complete measurement .    because this set of operations @xmath239 is local , we would expect any measure of entanglement to not increase under these operations .",
    "however , the state which results from this procedure does in fact exhibit non - zero @xmath28 , as was demonstrated earlier .",
    "therefore we have found a complete local general measurement for which the entanglement increases based upon alternative covariance . thus the unitarily maximised @xmath28 does not satisfy the conditions for a measure of mixed state entanglement proposed by vedral and plenio .",
    "we have shown that for pure two 2-state systems , the maximised covariance agrees with other measures of entanglement in specifying which states are disentangled and which are maximally entangled . for subspaces of larger dimension , the situation is less clear - cut since there are ambiguities in the process of selecting eigenvalues for the local operators , but it is possible to obtain information about the degree of higher - order correlations of two subsystems in this way .    the variance and covariance could be used to indicate the best measurements to make to detect entanglement of bipartite systems , by locating the unitary transformation which produces maximum covariance .",
    "however , the problem of mixed state separability measures is not resolved by the correlation functions @xmath188 and the covariance , as we have used them in this paper .",
    "nevertheless the link between alternative variance and the conjugate variable derivatives for position , momentum , energy and time is intriguing , and might be extended to other quantised models involving conjugate variables .",
    "the inequality @xmath240 , with equality for pure states , should be applicable to situations where observations are made upon impure states .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for pure density matrices @xmath1 , both the average value and the variance of an operator @xmath241 are symmetrical under the interchange of @xmath1 and @xmath241 , when expressed in the form @xmath242 they motivate the suggestion that a quantum state @xmath50 is best represented not as a ket , but as a projection operator @xmath243 . any measurement process on the state is relational in the sense of rovelli @xcite : the notion of state vector reduction is replaced by the notion that every new measurement process requires a new hilbert space to be defined , with new operators corresponding to the new state and any successive measurement made upon the state .",
    "the basic idea is that a measurement treats the state information in a comparative sense , with meaning only in relation to the operator corresponding to the observable quantity being measured .",
    "the process of state reduction to the eigenstate of some observable under a measurement is an _ apparent one _ resulting not from the action of the _ operator _ corresponding to the measurement , but from _ some other _ physical process which occurs in the measurement , such as a filtering process of some kind ( like the case of a stern - gerlach experiment ) , causing _ later _",
    "measurements on the physical system to be _ represented _ in a completely new basis by new state and measurement operators .",
    "the adoption of the projector as a unit of relational information does not change any predictions of quantum mechanics in terms of average values only has relational significance in this interpretation . ] .",
    "it is well known that a spin state @xmath244 can be obtained by forming a fully symmetric direct product of @xmath245 spin 1/2 states . denoting the spin 1/2 states by @xmath246 , the spin @xmath247 states are given by : @xmath248/\\sqrt{2j }   \\nonumber\\\\   \\cdots & & \\cdots",
    "\\nonumber\\\\     \\cdots & & \\cdots\\nonumber\\\\   |j ,- j\\rangle & = & |dd\\ldots d\\rangle\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the majorana - penrose representation @xcite these states are mapped onto the unit sphere , with stereographic projection @xmath249 taken from the south pole , onto the complex plane by making the association : @xmath250    this association may be rewritten in terms of the spin-@xmath137 basis in an elegant way which emphasises that the @xmath251 powers are proportional to a symmetrised sum where @xmath130 spin-@xmath137 terms of spin @xmath252 , and @xmath253 spin @xmath254 terms are selected , namely latexmath:[\\[^{2j}c_{j+m } z^{j+m}\\leftrightarrow     the sum is taken over all ways of selecting @xmath130 spin-@xmath137 elements from the @xmath256 elements in the spin-@xmath247 space .",
    "thus from a general spin state @xmath257 we can define a polynomial @xmath258 where @xmath259 .",
    "the roots of this polynomial ( ii ) @xmath260 ( iii ) @xmath261 . ]",
    "give @xmath262 points on the stereographic plane and , correspondingly , a general spin @xmath247 state , being some superposition over @xmath263 values , will be described by @xmath262 distinct points on the poincar sphere , obtained by stereographic projection of the roots placed on the horizontal @xmath116-@xmath110 plane .",
    "it is worth remarking that another spin state @xmath264 , represented by another polynomial , @xmath265 yields a scalar product , @xmath266    in the case where the degree @xmath263 of the polynomial is less than @xmath262 , @xmath267 additional points at the south pole ( the projective point ) are added to the projection , corresponding to ` roots at infinity ' .",
    "figure [ poincare2 ] depicts an example of stereographic projection for the spin-@xmath132 state represented by the quadratic polynomial @xmath268/\\sqrt{2}.\\ ] ] by contrast , for spin 1 , the maximum and minimum spin states @xmath269 and @xmath270 correpond to two repeated points at the north and south pole , respectively ; on the other hand the pure intermediate spin state @xmath271 corresponds to one point at the north pole and the other at the south pole .",
    "the bell states , @xmath272 are also antipodal points , but are located around the equator , specifically at coordinates ( 1,0,0 ) & ( -1,0,0 ) and ( 0,1,0 ) & ( 0,-1,0 ) . under all accepted measures of entanglement , the spin zero state @xmath273 ,",
    "the bell states @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( in fact , all local unitary transformations of these states ) are maximally entangled .",
    "this suggests that taking the two points as `` far apart as one another '' on the poincar sphere is one possible way of producing maximal entanglement .",
    "another point of interest is that for these spin 1 states , the rotationally invariant dispersion measure , @xmath276 attains the maximum value of 2 , because @xmath277 vanishes ; so it also suggests that the quantity @xmath278 might serve@xcite as a way of characterising the entanglement of the individual 1/2 spins that make up the @xmath247 state .",
    "in fact the dispersion in @xmath125 is equivalent to dispersion in any of the components @xmath279 and to the covariance of any two components .",
    "this is because the total angular momentum is @xmath280 and all states on the poincar sphere are symmetrised ; therefore the values taken by all the local @xmath279 are the same .",
    "thus when acting on these symmetrised states , @xmath281 , for all @xmath282 , and the variance of any local @xmath279 is just as good an entanglement measure .",
    "we can also take any two subspaces @xmath283 and evaluate the covariance of @xmath279 and @xmath284 ; the space being symmetrised , any @xmath283 ( including @xmath165 ) may be taken !",
    "thus the symmetrised states of maximised @xmath124 have maximal covariance of the local @xmath279 , as well .",
    "finally , since we are dealing with spin 1/2 states , @xmath279 have only have two distinct eigenvalues , and hence these local operators are directly proportional to the equal weight local operators of dimension two defined in section 3 .",
    "we may use these considerations to find the symmetrised states of maximum dispersion for arbitrarily high @xmath125 - these states will have the maximum covariance of any two local @xmath279 . from the result in section 4",
    ", the local covariance attains the maximum value of 1 whenever the reduced density matrices for the subspace on which those local operators jointly act are of maximum entropy . for a spin @xmath137 space ,",
    "the reduced density matrices must be of the form @xmath285 $ ] .    for general @xmath247-values ,",
    "observe that disentangled states on the poincar sphere are fully factorisable since the states are symmetrised .",
    "clearly a fully factorisable state will have zero local operator variance for any operator with the local state as an eigenstate .",
    "their poincar sphere representation simply consists of @xmath245 repeated roots , since the general symmetrised , factorised state is a product of @xmath286 kets @xmath287 because of the @xmath249-symmetrisation properties for spin @xmath286 systems .",
    "next it is useful to ask which states maximise @xmath124 if this is to serve as a possible indication of entanglement . when @xmath288 , as we have seen in section 3 , the states are represented on the poincar sphere by two diametrically opposed points , one example being the state @xmath289 .",
    "when @xmath290 the states having maximum @xmath124 are those states which maximise the covariance of any two local operators . as was seen such states must be expressible as symmetrised unitary transformations of @xmath291 in the local basis for the two operators in question .",
    "thus the overall states must be expressible , by symmetry , as global rotations of @xmath292 .",
    "these are the ` triangular ' states , namely those represented by 3 points on the poincar sphere arranged in an equilateral triangle around any great circle  a global unitary transformation ( which preserves symmetrisation ) simply rotates this configuration around the sphere . choosing the circle to lie equatorially ,",
    "a polynomial producing such roots is @xmath293 , which corresponds to the state @xmath294/\\sqrt{2 } = |uuu+ddd\\rangle/\\sqrt{2}.$ ]    when @xmath295 the symmetrised states of maximum dispersion are the states with a tetrahedral representation on the sphere .",
    "choosing one of the apices of the tetrahedron at the north pole , we arrive at the polynomial @xmath296 which corresponds to the maximally entangled state @xmath297/3    = |uuuu + uddd + dudd + ddud + dddu\\rangle/\\sqrt{5}.\\ ] ] note that here , as in the previous case , the maximal @xmath50 lead to vanishing mean values @xmath298    for @xmath299 there are two classes of states with maximum dispersion , with slightly different geometries .",
    "the first of these is pyramidal with one apex at the north pole and the other four apices at equal latitude ( or any global rotation of this state ) , while the second has one point at the north pole another at the south pole and the remaining three points distributed equilaterally on the equator .",
    "hence the first configuration corresponds to the polynomial @xmath300 or the state @xmath301/\\sqrt{8/3}$ ] , whereas the second configuration leads to @xmath302 , or the state @xmath303/\\sqrt{2}.$ ] both choices have maximum @xmath124 and so the _ total spin variance is unable to discriminate between them_. however , local equal - weight measures are able to discriminate between these states , so it seems that in more complicated cases entanglement is most naturally described by keeping the covariance of local operators in mind .    in order to use the ( rotationally invariant ) dispersion as a measure of pure state entanglement",
    ", one needs to consider that the symmetrised nature of the state is a reflection of the choice of basis .",
    "thus one might define the variance - entanglement for a general state as the variance of the symmetrised form of the state , under an appropriate local unitary transformation . however , it is not always possible to symmetrise an arbitrary state with local unitary transformations in spaces of spin 1 or higher .",
    "thus it seems that the dispersion is not a perfect entanglement measure , although it does give an indication of the degree of entanglement of these particular states , because of its connection with the covariance through symmetrisation .",
    "consider @xmath1 for a composite @xmath304-dimensional system as an object transforming under @xmath305 like @xmath306 , where @xmath307 denotes the reducible @xmath308 representation of @xmath309 ; in tensor notation we can write @xmath1 in the form @xmath310 , where early latin letters refer to the first unitary group and the later letters stand for the second group . here",
    "we want to count the number of @xmath305 singlets @xmath311 in the symmetrised product @xmath312 .",
    "thus in the notation where representations are labelled by partitions @xcite , @xmath313 but @xmath314 can only contain a singlet if @xmath315 .",
    "moreover @xmath316 and @xmath317 have to be respectively @xmath19 and @xmath20 part partitions , say `` @xmath318 '' , etc .",
    ", otherwise @xmath319 vanishes in @xmath320 . therefore @xmath321 but it is known that @xmath322 for any @xmath323 and moreover the order is immaterial , because the clebsch series is symmetric .",
    "thus we have only to count the appropriate partitions , @xmath324 this is not easy to work out in the general case , but is relatively simple for the case @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath286 is even or odd , the partitions are : @xmath325 @xmath326    now the generating function for invariants of order @xmath286 in @xmath1 is written @xmath327 . including the even and odd cases , @xmath328        = \\frac{1+q^2}{(1-q^2)^2(1-q)}.\\ ] ] the denominator of @xmath329 is crucial for its interpretation",
    ": we can recognize that for the @xmath330 case invariants are freely generated by two quadratic factors ( namely @xmath331 ) and one linear factor ( viz .",
    "@xmath332 ) , but there is an extra quadratic factor in the numerator which may only be used once .",
    "we may associate these factors with @xmath333 @xmath334 @xmath335 @xmath336 the last of these invariants is obviously related to @xmath337 and tr(@xmath338 ) ; however we do not get a new invariant from its square because it is then expressible _ entirely _ as products of @xmath339 , tr @xmath338 and ( tr @xmath340 .",
    "thus effectively tr(@xmath338 ) is _ only allowed once_.    we conclude that _ any _ local unitary invariant entanglement measure in the 2@xmath1402 case must take the form : @xmath341 where @xmath342 are functions which depend on the way @xmath13 is defined .",
    "we think that this result must be useful for classifying entanglement .",
