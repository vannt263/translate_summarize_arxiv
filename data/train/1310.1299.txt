    "matrices with random ( or pseudo - random ) elements appear naturally in many different problems and are well investigated in physical and mathematical literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this note",
    "we consider a special class of sparse random matrices , namely , matrices associated with tree ( or tree - like ) structures .",
    "a fundamental property of such matrices is that the number of non - zero elements in each row and column either remains finite or grows much slowly than the matrix dimension when the latter increases .    as usual , a ( connected )",
    "tree is a graph where any pair of vertices is connected by only one path without repeating vertices .",
    "vertices are labeled by integers . if a symmetric ( or hermitian ) matrix @xmath0 is such that its entries @xmath1 , @xmath2 , are non - zero if and only if vertices @xmath3 and @xmath4 are connected on a given tree , then the matrix @xmath0 is said to be associated with the tree .",
    "an example of such a matrix is the adjacency matrix of the tree . in general ,",
    "diagonal entries of @xmath0 are nonzero .",
    "let @xmath5 be the green function for matrix @xmath0 , namely @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the identity matrix .",
    "it is well established that for matrices associated with a tree there exist recursive relations which connect the diagonal elements @xmath8 of the green function with similar quantities but for smaller matrices .",
    "probably the simplest way to derive such relations on a tree is to use an easily verified identity ( sometimes called the schur complement formula ) , which states that for any matrix @xmath0 one has @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the green function as in but for the matrix @xmath11 obtained from @xmath0 by removing row @xmath12 and column @xmath12 .    for a tree ,",
    "removing one vertex splits the remaining graph into a disjoint union of smaller trees .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is block - diagonal and the green function @xmath10 has no matrix elements between different neighbors of a fixed site @xmath12 .",
    "it means that for trees eq .   takes the form @xmath13 where the sum is taken over all neighbors of site @xmath12 and we assume that matrix @xmath0 is hermitian .    applying the same arguments to @xmath10 leads to a similar equation for each neighbor @xmath14 of @xmath12 , namely @xmath15 where the sum is over all neighbors of @xmath14 except @xmath12 ( which has already been removed ) . in principle , @xmath16 in the right - hand side of this equation is the green function element for a matrix obtained from @xmath0 by removing two connected sites @xmath12 and @xmath14 . but because we are on a tree , @xmath16 is the same whether only @xmath14 or all its ancestors are removed ; thus it is sufficient to indicate only the last removed site .",
    "it is this property which permits to write the recursive relation where on both sides similar quantities are present .    for finite trees",
    "the above relations allow to calculate the green function recursively , but their the most important application corresponds to infinite ( or very large ) trees where matrix elements of @xmath17 are assumed to be independent random variables ( or constants ) . in this case , because of the disjoint nature of different sub - trees , eq",
    ".   for all @xmath14 only involves variables @xmath18 from the sub - tree to which @xmath14 belongs .",
    "thus for large uniform trees , one can assume that all @xmath19 are independent random variables having the same distribution .",
    "let @xmath20 be the coordination number of vertex @xmath14 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , be random variables distributed according to that distribution . for simplicity",
    "we assume below that the diagonal matrix element @xmath23 is a random variable @xmath24 , off - diagonal elements @xmath18 are real i.i.d .",
    "variables @xmath25 , and all coordination numbers are equal to @xmath20 .",
    "then eq .   means that the random variable @xmath26 has the same distribution as the @xmath21 .",
    "this equation is the main tool for the investigation of random uniform trees .",
    "it has been obtained initially by abou - chacra , thouless , and anderson in their study of self - consistent theory of localization @xcite and later it has been re - derived by many different methods : replica formalism @xcite , @xmath27-model @xcite , ricatti equation @xcite , rank - one perturbation @xcite , cavity method @xcite etc .",
    "we shall refer below to as the tree equation .",
    "strictly speaking , the tree equation is valid only for infinite uniform trees ( the bethe lattice ) but in many cases it is applied to models which have only tree - like structure , i.e.  which can locally be approximated by trees but may have loops of large length .",
    "a typical example is that of random regular graphs , where each vertex has the same number of neighbors , as in a tree with constant coordination number , but where the boundary shell present in finite trees is absent ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for certain tree - like models",
    "the validity of the tree equation can be proved rigorously @xcite .",
    "there exist three main types of tree - like problems , corresponding to three possible sources of randomness in the tree equation .",
    "the first corresponds to a regular tree with a fixed coordination number and with only diagonal disorder ( i.e.  @xmath24 is a random variable and @xmath28 ) .",
    "this model has been proposed in a seminal paper @xcite and was recently investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second class ( see e.g. @xcite ) corresponds to models which are also defined on a fixed regular tree but have only off - diagonal disorder ( i.e. all @xmath25 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables and @xmath29 ) .",
    "finally , the third type of models includes trees without disorder but with fluctuating coordination number .",
    "characteristic examples of such models are erds - rnyi graphs @xcite or sparse random matrices with a finite connectivity @xcite . in this note , as an example , we will restrict ourselves to random regular graphs .",
    "a general method for numerically solving the tree equation has been proposed in @xcite and it is commonly used now under the name of belief propagation method @xcite .",
    "the main steps of this method are as follows .",
    "first , fix arbitrarily an initial sample of a large number , say @xmath30 , of elements @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "second , choose randomly @xmath33 integers from @xmath34 to @xmath30 and variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 from their known distributions .",
    "third , calculate @xmath35 from the tree equation .",
    "fourth , choose randomly an element from the initial sample and replace it by the calculated @xmath35 .",
    "repeat these steps till the convergence of the resulting distribution to the distribution of @xmath35 .",
    "there exist two types of solutions of .",
    "the first one corresponds to real values of the energy @xmath36 : at each step of the iteration , the variables @xmath31 are real and after iteration one obtains the distribution of the real variable @xmath35 .",
    "the second type of solution corresponds to adding a small positive imaginary part to the energy , that is , put @xmath37 in . in this case , upon iteration the @xmath31 become complex variables and the result of the iteration will yield the distribution of both the real and the imaginary part of @xmath35 , which may and will depend on @xmath38 .",
    "if the energy @xmath36 corresponds to a region of localized states , then when @xmath39 the imaginary part of @xmath35 will tend to zero almost everywhere , while if the energy corresponds to a region of non - localized states the imaginary part of @xmath35 goes to a finite distribution .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to real values of the energy , with @xmath40 .",
    "the purpose of this note is to discuss the calculation of the mean spectral density of typical tree - like models by construction of approximate solution of the tree equation . strictly speaking",
    ", the method is valid for trees with a large coordination number but often gives good results even at small coordination numbers .",
    "the method itself is not new and has been used widely for random erds - rnyi graphs ( see e.g.  @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we first clarify certain important points which seem not to be discussed in the literature and then investigate in detail the application of the method to random regular graphs and compare different types of approximations .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . after setting some definitions in section [ rhodee ] , section  [ mean_field ] is devoted to the general discussion of the method .",
    "it is demonstrated that the commonly used mean - field solution of the tree equation corresponds to the approximation of the exact solution by a symmetric cauchy distribution whose parameters are calculated self - consistently .",
    "different useful formulas for the mean spectral density are briefly discussed in this section . in section  [ diagonal ] the case of regular graphs with diagonal disorder is considered . by comparing results of direct numerical calculations with various kinds of approximations we check their precision and found that at zeroth order the best results for regular trees with diagonal disorder is given by the so - called single defect approximation proposed in @xcite .",
    "section  [ off_diagonal ] treats the case of regular graphs with off - diagonal disorder . for these models",
    "the best results are obtained by using the modified effective medium approximation introduced in section  [ mean_field ] . in all considered cases ,",
    "the next order approximation for the tree equation solution , though it agrees much better with the numerical solution obtained by belief propagation , improves noticeably the spectral density only at lowest coordination numbers .",
    "the conclusion of this note ( stated in section  [ conclusion ] ) is that the approximate solution of the tree equation is useful , flexible , and general method of calculation of the mean spectral density in various uniform tree - like models .",
    "the mean spectral density is defined as usual by @xmath41 where @xmath42 are eigenvalues of @xmath0 and the average is performed over random realizations of the matrix entries .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "here we only consider real solutions of eq .  .",
    "let us denote by @xmath43 and @xmath44 the ( known ) probability densities of @xmath24 and @xmath45 .",
    "the probability density of variable @xmath46 is given by some function @xmath47 , and that of variable @xmath48 by a function @xmath49 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath50 is @xmath51 the tree equation implies that for real @xmath52 the probability density @xmath47 satisfies the equation @xmath53 or equivalently @xmath54 eigenvalues of @xmath0 correspond to values of @xmath36 where @xmath55 gets singular . assuming that @xmath56 and @xmath57 in can be replaced by random variables , which we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath58 respectively , we see that these singularities occur at @xmath59 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the definition gives @xmath60 where the summation is performed over all @xmath20 neighbors of a given site .",
    "another useful expression for the mean spectral density is obtained by transforming eq .   into the form",
    "@xmath61 performing the integral over @xmath62 in eq .   yields @xmath63 of course , the above formulas can be rewritten in many equivalent forms .",
    "therefore the knowledge of the spectral density can directly be deduced from that of the distribution @xmath47 which is a solution of the tree equation , or from that of @xmath49 . in the next section",
    "we consider simple solutions of these equations .",
    "the tree equation may have a constant complex solution , that is , a @xmath64 ( depending on @xmath36 ) such that @xmath65 if such a @xmath66 exists , the mean spectral density associated with this solution is obtained from as @xmath67 using contour integration , this expression can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath68 when the imaginary part of @xmath69 is positive .",
    "equation is known as the single defect approximation ( sda ) @xcite .    to further simplify this expression",
    "one can simply argue that for large @xmath33 ( which , as we see below , is the parameter which control this type of approximation ) the sum over @xmath20 terms in eq .   can be approximated by a sum over @xmath33 terms , so that from one concludes that the mean spectral density takes the form @xmath70 this type of approximation is widely applied for sparse random matrices , where eq .",
    "is called the effective medium approximation ( ema ) @xcite . physically , this solution is a kind of a mean field and often these equations are obtained by arguing that the random variable @xmath52 distributed according to @xmath47 fluctuates slowly around its mean value @xmath64 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such an approach is simple , physically transparent , does not require heavy numerical calculations , and gives , as a rule , quite good results .",
    "the trouble is that its main assumption that variable @xmath52 fluctuates only slowly around its mean value @xmath64 can not be , in general , correct for tree - like models .",
    "indeed , it follows from eq .   that if the function @xmath71 is smooth , then @xmath47 has to decrease as @xmath72 in particular , this means that @xmath47 belongs to the class of heavy - tail distributions , for which the mean value @xmath73 does not exist .",
    "therefore , the meaning of a ( complex ) mean field solution and , especially , its relation to a direct numerical solution of the tree equation for real @xmath52 remains obscure .",
    "the above mean field approach is equivalent to the assumption that the function @xmath47 can be approximated by the symmetric cauchy distribution @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 real parameters , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . indeed , for a test function @xmath79 without singularities in the upper - half plane one has the identity @xmath80 in other words , the cauchy distribution is indistinguishable from the @xmath81-function when acting on a large class of functions . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath82 and @xmath83 are real and @xmath84 , contour integration yields the following formula @xmath85 other useful elementary properties of cauchy distributions that we will make use of are the following identities @xmath86 and the convolution property @xmath87 the characteristic function of is given by @xmath88 let us calculate the characteristic function of @xmath47 , @xmath89 using one obtains the exact functional relation @xmath90 if in the right - hand side of this equation @xmath47 is replaced by the cauchy distribution @xmath91 given by eq .",
    ", the consecutive use of gives a  first - order approximation  of the characteristic function of @xmath92 as @xmath93 in general @xmath94 .",
    "requiring that parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 be such that at small argument @xmath95 is exactly equivalent to requiring that @xmath96 satisfies the mean field equation .",
    "these arguments can be reformulated as follows .",
    "let @xmath64 be a ( complex ) constant solution of and @xmath97 the corresponding cauchy distribution .",
    "then an approximate solution to such that @xmath98 for small arguments @xmath99 is obtained by replacing @xmath92 by @xmath100 in the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "it means that @xmath64 is not a mean value of a random variable as in the usual mean field approach but just a pole of the cauchy distribution which reproduces the behavior of the characteristic function @xmath101 at small @xmath102 .",
    "( it is interesting to notice that for the usual goe ensemble of random matrices the local green function also has a cauchy distribution , see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "the knowledge of @xmath64 permits to calculate easily the mean spectral density from eqs .   or . in the cases considered in the next sections we found that approximation does not give good results at small values of @xmath33 .",
    "instead , we propose to use another simple approximation obtained by substituting the cauchy approximation into eq .  .",
    "simple transformations based on eqs .",
    " lead to the following approximate formula for the mean spectral density @xmath103 this expression is almost as simple as ema but often gives better results .",
    "we refer to it as to the modified effective medium approximation ( mema ) .",
    "a few formulas are useful to mention . when @xmath97 is substituted into eq .",
    "one gets , after integration over @xmath104 , a first order approximation of @xmath49 , as @xmath105 the first iteration of the initial cauchy distribution , @xmath106 , is then straightforwardly obtained either from this expression and eq .  , or directly from eq .",
    ": if we define @xmath107 then eq .   can be rewritten @xmath108 where average is taken over @xmath24 and the @xmath109 .",
    "this is exactly the characteristic function of the cauchy distribution with parameters @xmath110 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "thus one directly gets @xmath111 the next iterations can be calculated in the same manner .",
    "below we refer to the cauchy function @xmath91 with parameters from eq .   as the zeroth order approximation of @xmath47 and to the first iteration as the first order approximation . for",
    "each order of approximation one can calculate the mean spectral density by using either eq .   or eq .  .",
    "both formulas are exact when @xmath47 obeys the tree equation , but for approximate expressions they may and will give different results .",
    "though , in principle , one can rely on the results only when these two expressions are close to each other , for a given problem usually one of these formulas works better and we shall indicate it .",
    "let us now consider in detail the example of a regular tree ( which will be approximated by a regular graph to avoid boundary effects ) where each vertex has @xmath20 neighbors .",
    "the matrix we consider is the adjacency matrix of the graph , to which we add a diagonal part given by i.i.d .",
    "random variables with e.g. the uniform distribution @xmath112 it is this model which has been considered in @xcite and later has been investigated in many places ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such a model corresponds to the situation discussed in section [ mean_field ] with fixed @xmath113 .",
    "therefore the mean field equation reads @xmath114    equation implies that @xmath115 is the the probability distribution of a sum of @xmath33 i.i.d .",

    "it states that a properly normalized sum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables tends to the one of known stable distributions .",
    "if the second moment is finite , the limiting distribution is the gaussian . for heavy - tail distributions , when the second moment does not exist , the limiting distribution is one of the levy distributions .",
    "the asymptotics means that @xmath47 belongs to the domain of attraction of the symmetric cauchy distribution , so at large @xmath33 the probability density of @xmath33-copies of @xmath52 in the bulk is close to @xmath116 characterized by the two parameters @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "important is that these parameters are determined only from the behavior of the characteristic function of @xmath47 at small @xmath102 , @xmath120 as in .",
    "the mean spectral density is then given by which , using the approximation , yields @xmath121 which corresponds exactly to sda .",

    "the first order formulas are practically indistinguishable in the scale of the figures .",
    "this robustness can be explained as follows . as has been mentioned in section  [ mean_field ] , the choice of the cauchy distribution as the zeroth order approximation is to a large degree arbitrary ( what matters is only the asymptotics ) . on the other hand , according to the generalized central limit theorem the @xmath33-fold convolution , @xmath71 , of the chosen zeroth order function is in the bulk universal and is not sensitive to details of the initial function .",

    "and since from the definition @xmath207 it is easy to check that eq .   coincides with the mean - field equation , which gives another confirmation of the tree - equation universality .",
    "we investigated the mean spectral density for random regular graphs by finding an approximate real solution of the tree equation associated with these graphs .",
    "this equation is general and is valid for any uniform tree - like models .",
    "the mean spectral density for these models is determined by the @xmath208-fold convolution of real tree equation solution , where @xmath20 is the coordination number of the tree . for large @xmath33",
    "the generalized central limit theorem states that in the bulk such convolution depends only on a few parameters which can be calculated directly from the initial function . from the structure of the tree equation",
    "it follows that the required solution belongs to the domain of attraction of the symmetric cauchy distribution .",

    "iterations of that initial cauchy distribution give next order approximations .",
    "when a good approximation for tree equation solution is found , the mean spectral density can be calculated using one of the exact formulas relating it to the tree equation solution ( see section  [ introduction ] ) .",
    "we applied this scheme for the calculation of mean spectral density for regular graphs with diagonal or off - diagonal disorder , and compared the zeroth and first order approximations with results of direct numerical calculations .",
    "as expected , for large coordination number the zeroth order approximation for the density gives quite good results , which are rather accurate even at the smallest @xmath33 .",
    "for regular graphs with diagonal disorder the sda gives a slightly better results but for graphs with off - diagonal disorder the mema is closer to the numerics than other zeroth order approximations .    as for the tree equation solution itself , the first order approximation is always much closer to the numerical solution obtained by the belief propagation than the zeroth order cauchy approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding discrepancies for the mean spectral density are usually noticeable only at small coordination numbers .",
    "the statement that the mean spectral density of random graphs is related to the solution of an equation which , strictly speaking , is valid only for corresponding trees is physically quite natural and could be proved rigorously in certain cases without disorder and with diagonal disorder .",
    "further investigation of this and related questions in the spirit of trace formulas on graphs ( see e.g. @xcite ) is of interest",
