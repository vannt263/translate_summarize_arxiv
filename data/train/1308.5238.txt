    "the results from the nd measurements are not only consistent with the nmr results but also indicate a collinear long - range afm - ordered ground state for this compound with an ordered moment of 1.9(5 )  @xmath14/co , consistent with the estimate from nmr .",
    "the magnetic entropy @xmath107 at @xmath4 is considerably smaller than its value at high temperature , which indicates that strong afm correlations occur above @xmath4 .",
    "the emergence of afm correlations was manifested by the increase of @xmath213 below 100  k , by the presence of broad magnetic peaks observed below 50  k in the nd measurements , and by the broad peak in @xmath0(@xmath38 ) at @xmath28 15  k.    there are two factors which govern the magnetic properties of this system , @xmath240 frustration and site inversion .",
    "we successfully prepared a polycrystalline sample of @xmath239 with a low inversion parameter @xmath39 = 0.057(20 ) .",
    "site disorder creates increased randomness of exchange interactions in the already frustrated compound.@xcite the suppression of the value of magnetic entropy at high temperatures from the value expected for @xmath13 = 3/2 suggests that the effective spin of the co at the @xmath1-site is smaller than 3/2 , which could be a manifestation of both spin frustration and co - al site inversion effects .",
    "the presence of dynamic short - range magnetic ordering observed in neutron scattering experiments below @xmath209 50  k can be caused mainly by the site inversion effects . as pointed out previously , although a spin - liquid ground state has been proposed from magnetic susceptibility measurements for @xmath239 with low values of @xmath39,@xcite our nmr and nd measurements conclusively proved the existence of a long - range afm - ordered state below 10  k. since site inversion plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of this spinel compound , it will also be interesting to perform systematic nmr and nd measurements on highly disordered ( high @xmath39 ) @xmath239 samples to investigate how the system changes from the afm state to a spin glass state .",
