    "a basic representation of local realism presented earlier postulates that photons are comprised of separate real entities of wave structure and energy quanta [ 1 , 2 ] . in this representation ,",
    "the wave intensity is a relative probability density that determines the distribution of the resident energy quanta as a proportionate energy flux density consistent with born s first principle .",
    "a wave entity is independent of its resident energy quanta , and wave entities are mutually non - interactive .",
    "these properties are essentially equivalent to those of the locally real wave structures postulated by de broglie @xcite and interpreted as propensities by popper  @xcite .",
    "interference is a consequence of the superposition of these non - interactive wave entities in a region of mutual intersection .",
    "the physical manifestation of this interference in the intersection region is the redistribution of the energy flux density proportionate to the superposition wave intensity .",
    "conversely , in quantum mechanics photons are treated as probabilistic entities that exhibit dualistic wave or particle properties depending upon the nature of the measurement process .",
    "the proportionality between wave intensity and energy flux density is a superfluous invariant .",
    "moreover , a photon can interfere only with itself .",
    "then the class of experiments involving two intersecting independent photon beams seemingly provides a testable basis for differentiating between local realism and quantum mechanics .",
    "many such experiments have demonstrated that interference does occur in apparent conflict with quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , mandel argued that the results of these experiments do not constitute a violation of quantum mechanics since , for any photon , we do not know on which beam that photon had initially resided @xcite .",
    "this lack of knowledge provides a loophole that allows any photon , with its initial beam of residence not known , to interfere with itself .",
    "consequently , because of that loophole , this class of experiments is not generally viewed as differentially testing quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "mandel further contended that this conclusion was applicable to the discrete realm as well as to the continuous wave realm .",
    "our objective here is to close mandel s loophole by taking this class of experiments employing intersecting independent beams an additional step . in the continuous wave realm ,",
    "we prepare one of the beams in accord with the locally real representation such that the beam is in a state depleted in energy flux density ( irradiance ) relative to the beam s wave intensity noting that this property of depletion is contrary to quantum mechanics @xcite . a transient spatial coupling of an independent beam and that depleted beam provides for a zone of mutual interference of those beams .",
    "we still do not know for any given photon on which beam that particular photon had initially resided so we certainly continue to expect interference to occur in this zone from the perspectives of both local realism and quantum mechanics .",
    "however , for local realism the exchange of energy quanta is not completely random .",
    "a potentially measurable net redistribution of energy quanta should occur onto the depleted beam from the independent beam in an equilibration process .",
    "this net redistribution of course is not consistent with quantum mechanics since depletion itself is excluded .",
    "in the present work , reference to quantum mechanics  implicitly denotes the standard probabilistic interpretation of that physical representation .",
    "conversely , local realism  implies a physical representation devoid of the particular conflicting tenets of the probabilistic interpretation but still fundamentally consistent with the quantum mechanical formalism .    because these two representations have distinct similarities and differences , it is essential that we precisely define several critical quantities .",
    "for some point on the cross section of a given beam the energy flux density , identified as the irradiance @xmath1 , is measurable by a conventional energy sensitive detector .",
    "the associated wave intensity @xmath2 , which is effectively a probability density , may be measured by assessing interference visibility with a reference beam . @xmath1 and @xmath2 vary proportionately across the beam s cross section consistent with born s first principle .",
    "the `` occupation value '' of a beam defined as @xmath3 is then constant at all points on a beam s cross section .",
    "integrating @xmath1 over a beam cross section @xmath4 gives the total beam power while the analogous integral @xmath5 is recognized as the total probability .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 vary proportionately , the ratio of their integrals also yields the same value of @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , it will generally be more convenient to work with the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 rather than their respective integrals .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can usually be treated as representing the respective maximum values on a particular beam cross section e.g. for a gaussian profile , the values at the geometrical center .    in the present context ,",
    "the two representations fundamentally differ in the treatment of wave intensity @xmath2 . for quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath2 is an absolute probability density that is in a fixed proportion to @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , for local realism @xmath2 is a relative probability density .",
    "the immediate consequence of this disparity is that for quantum mechanics the occupation value is inherently some constant @xmath7 , rendering that quantity as superfluous , whereas for local realism a `` non - ordinary '' beam could , in principle , be prepared such that @xmath8 ( although we expect that virtually all typically encountered beams will be `` ordinary '' with an occupation value @xmath7 not in conflict with quantum mechanics ) .",
    "arbitrary units can always be employed such that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pure numerical values mutually scaled to equality .",
    "consequently , for this choice of units the occupation value @xmath9 is universal for quantum mechanics but is applicable to local realism only for ordinary beams .",
    "then , relative to resident energy quanta , a beam for which @xmath10 is appropriately defined as `` depleted '' .    in the discrete realm ,",
    "where at most only an individual photon is present on any macroscopic segment of beam path , an @xmath6 for local realism may deviate from unity by means as trivial as a simple beam splitter .",
    "for the discrete realm , as well as the continuous wave realm , the incident wave intensity is always fractionally divided between the two output channels in accord with the transmission and reflection coefficients of the beam splitter , but , most noticeably for discrete events , the particular output channel assumed by the single energy quantum is random and uncontrollable , albeit , statistically predictable at the exit face of the beam splitter .",
    "then , for a particular output channel and event , the resultant output beam is also randomly and uncontrollably transiently `` depleted '' or `` enriched '' in energy quantum relative to the wave intensity .",
    "quantum mechanics is not violated in this discrete phenomenon since probabilistically , on both of the output beams , we still have an expectation of an energy quantum proportionate to the fractional wave intensity .    historically , many investigations designed to test the reality of empty ( totally depleted ) de broglie waves have used related methods .",
    "however these methods can only yield the very weak wave intensities associated with discrete photon beams .",
    "we report here the results of an experimental test of this disparity between quantum mechanics and local realism using an apparatus that should generate depleted beams in the continuous wave realm from the perspective of local realism .",
    "a transient equilibration of one of these beams with an ordinary beam is then expected to provide evidence resolving that disparity .    as a prelude to considering the details of the apparatus ,",
    "we first consider a single beam incident on two similar but critically distinctive gratings @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( max levy autograph , inc . , ba011 and zy002 , respectively ) .",
    "both have the basic structure of a ronchi ruling , an array of equal width transmissive and opaque bands , with opaque bands at 100 per inch on a glass plate .",
    "the opaque bands on @xmath11 are thin @xmath13 depositions of black evaporated chrome whereas on @xmath12 the opaque bands are fabricated by etching the glass support plate to a depth of @xmath14 and filling with black epoxy .",
    "the resultant diffractive orders of the two gratings differ measureably in relative irradiances .",
    "most notably the irradiance ratio of the @xmath15 order relative to the @xmath16 order is @xmath17 for @xmath11 and @xmath18 for @xmath12 .",
    "this deviation is not unexpected since the relative irradiances of diffractive orders are a very sensitive function of the periodic structures .    for an idealized ronchi ruling ,",
    "the relative irradiance of the @xmath19 order is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath15 to @xmath21 order ratio , @xmath22 , is very nearly equivalent to that of @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , we approximate @xmath11 as an idealized ronchi ruling with relative wave amplitudes given by @xmath23 which is used to generate a normalized set of amplitudes @xmath24 0.506 , 0.323 , 0 , -0.107 , 0 , 0.064 , 0 , -0.046 for the @xmath25  order @xmath26 etc . truncated at @xmath27 since higher orders are substantially diminished . in the scalar treatment applicable to this relatively coarse grating , the squares of these amplitudes @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30  are respectively the @xmath25 order wave intensity and irradiance for a single beam incident on @xmath11 .",
    "the set @xmath31 is normalized here such that the sum of squares gives a 0.5 transmitted wave intensity and  a 0.5 transmitted irradiance where the incident @xmath32 .",
    "this normalization is consistent with the 50% transmissivity of ronchi rulings to plane radiation . because of the equivalence of transmitted irradiance and wave intensity for a single incident beam , the theoretical occupation value computed for the total transmitted set is trivially @xmath33 where the argument specifies that one beam is incident .",
    "equilibration further provides that the occupation value @xmath34 for each individual transmitted @xmath19 order diffraction beam since the energy quanta at the exit face of the grating distribute onto the individual beams in proportion to their respective wave intensities .",
    "accordingly , we suppress the subscripts @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is understood to apply to both the total and the individual beams of the diffraction orders .",
    "to first order , the higher irradiance ratio for @xmath12 relative to that of @xmath11 is equivalent to a relative broadening of the diffractive envelope .",
    "( this broadening could equivalently be generated by providing @xmath11 with with plano - concave transmissive bands . )",
    "the higher orders of @xmath12 can be approximated by numerically fitting the @xmath38 argument of @xmath11 to yield the ratio @xmath18 which results in @xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding set of @xmath12 normalized wave amplitudes is @xmath40 0.459 , 0.347 , 0.107 , -0.072 , -0.086 , 0 , 0.058 , 0.031 for orders",
    "@xmath26 etc .",
    "again truncated at @xmath27 .",
    "this set , like that of @xmath11 , is also normalized such that the sum of squares gives a 0.5 transmitted wave intensity and , equivalently , a 0.5 transmitted irradiance for the chosen normalization of the incident beam .",
    "similarly , for a single incident beam , the theoretical occupation value computed for the total transmitted set is trivially @xmath41 and this value also applies to each individual transmitted beam . then both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unremarkably unit valued consistent with quantum mechanics and local realism .    with the above set of amplitudes for @xmath11 and for @xmath12 , we can proceed to calculations of the respective @xmath44 and@xmath45 , theoretically predicted by local realism for two appropriately aligned incident beams .",
    "these calculations are intended here purely as an exercise in providing locally real predictions for the experimentally measured counterparts @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the two mutually coherent , mutually converging incident beams are angularly separated at some @xmath48 such that the resultant interference pattern has a spatial periodicity equal to that of the grating . for a relatively coarse grating , such as a ronchi ruling with 100 opaque bands per inch , the small angle approximation and a scalar treatment of amplitudes are applicable . for the above choice of @xmath48 ,  the angular separation of the adjacent diffraction orders from either incident beam @xmath49 resulting in spatial coincidences of orders from the two incident beams .",
    "we can treat the gratings as two - stage components , a periodic array of opaque and transmissive bands followed by some diffractive structure associated with the transmissive bands .",
    "the calculation of @xmath50 and@xmath51 requires a determination of the total transmitted irradiance and the total transmitted wave intensity for each .",
    "the total transmitted irradiance @xmath52 is simply the integrated peak - centered 50% of each interference pattern cycle normalized to the entire cycle ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the leading factor of two is the total incident irradiance of which 82.5% is transmitted where @xmath1 and @xmath2 for both incident beams are normalized to unity .",
    "@xmath54 is the same for both gratings since they share the same first stage array of opaque and transmissive bands .",
    "the second stage total wave intensity for @xmath11 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 in each term are understood to be the coincident amplitudes produced by the respective incident beams .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath11 were given above to @xmath27 order and since their magnitudes diminish substantially by that order the series is truncated by imposing @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the resultant occupation value @xmath61 strongly suggests that the configuration of two beams incident on the idealized grating @xmath11 does not generate output beams that are in conflict with quantum mechanics .    as a final exercise ,",
    "we similarly calculate @xmath62 . as before , @xmath63 .",
    "the total wave intensity @xmath64 is recognized as a summation functionally identical to eq . ( 3 ) but using the @xmath12 single beam amplitude set @xmath65 given above with @xmath66 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the resultant @xmath67 yields an @xmath68    the significant deviation of @xmath62 from unity predicts that the two beam configuration on @xmath12 , unlike that on @xmath11 , presents a conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "quantum mechanics , of course , would require that @xmath69 facilitated in the present case by a renormalization of the wave ( probability ) amplitudes .",
    "this renormalization necessarily must occur in @xmath12 at the `` first stage '' temporally coincident with the partial collapse of amplitudes at the opaque bands since no further collapse occurs up to and at the totally transmissive `` second stage '' .",
    "the renormalization must decrease the total transmitted probability density in order to maintain the quantum mechanically required unit value of @xmath62 .",
    "quantum mechanics then , quite curiously , arbitrarily requires a probability amplitude renormalization when the grating is @xmath12 but not when the grating is @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , when a strict interpretation of quantum mechanics is imposed , an even more bizarre phenomenon is evident . with the gratings treated as two - stage components , amplitude collapse and",
    "any renormalization must occur at a time @xmath70 when the incident wave encounters the first stage . at some later time",
    "@xmath71 , the wave encounters the second stage of either @xmath11 or @xmath12 . since only the second stages of these gratings",
    "are distinguishable , the amplitude collapse and any renormalization of the wave must have anticipated at @xmath70 which of those two gratings is in place .",
    "the implications of this anticipation go beyond even that of the non - local response of separated entangled photons or particles .",
    "however , it is not our intent here to examine the quantum mechanical consequences of the foregoing exercise in theoretical grating experiments , rather this exercise provides a motivation for constructing an apparatus with @xmath12 and experimentally testing quantum mechanics against local realism based upon the disparate predictions of @xmath62 .",
    "the experimental apparatus for this test is shown in fig .",
    "1 . aside from the lasers , all essential components and optical paths",
    "are depicted omitting only mirrors used for aligning and folding those paths .",
    "a 4mw polarized 633 nm hene laser generates an ordinary beam @xmath72 ( for which @xmath9 ) that is transmitted by a 0.7 transmissive beam splitter @xmath73 to lens @xmath74 ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) and into a diffractive beam splitter @xmath77 ( mems optical 1019 , fused silica 16 beam splitter ) .",
    "an aperture @xmath78 restricts the output of that beam splitter to two equal irradiance beams @xmath79 and @xmath80 mutually diverging at 6.5 mrad toward lens @xmath81 ( @xmath82 @xmath76 ) .",
    "@xmath81 converges the two beams at the plane of grating @xmath12 with a periodic structure width @xmath83 @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath79 and @xmath84 individual beam self - divergences are slightly reduced relative to that of the initial @xmath72 beam by the combined action of @xmath85 and @xmath81 serving as a beam expander .",
    "more significantly , this beam expander , straddling the diffractive beam splitter , avoids large self - divergences of @xmath79 and @xmath84 that would otherwise result if @xmath85 were omitted .",

    "shifting the positions of the rail - mounted diffractive beam splitter @xmath77 and grating @xmath12 along the optical axis permits adjustment of @xmath48 such that the resultant final interference pattern matches the grating s periodicity , i.e. @xmath89 , while maintaining beam spot coincidence of @xmath79 and @xmath84 at @xmath12 .",
    "concurrently , @xmath90 with this adjustment",
    ". a micro - translation stage is used to laterally shift @xmath12 with respect to the interference pattern thereby centering the principal maxima over the transmissive bands of the grating and maximizing the transmitted irradiance .",
    "the output beams of @xmath12 are intermittently blocked or transmitted by an adjacent chopper wheel .",
    "from the perspective of quantum mechanics and local realism , we expect that the total irradiance emerging from @xmath12 will distribute onto the output beams in proportion to the respective wave intensities given as terms in the eq .",
    "( 3 ) summation . for local realism",
    ", these output beam wave intensities represent real entities on the field that provide `` relative '' probabilities in the distribution of total transmitted irradiance onto the output beams . for clarity , only four of these beams are depicted in the figure .",

    "an aperture @xmath92 transmits one of these two , designated as beam @xmath86 , and blocks all other @xmath12 output beams .",
    "this designation is given since local realism predicts that @xmath86 is depleted .",
    "@xmath86 , which is a pulsed beam as a consequence of the chopper wheel , propagates to a 0.7 transmissive beam splitter @xmath93 .",
    "concurrently , when @xmath72 encounters @xmath73 , a fractional portion is reflected .",
    "that portion , still designated as @xmath72 , is directed through a beam expander comprised of lenses @xmath94 ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) and @xmath95 ( @xmath82 @xmath76 ) , into a variable attenuator ( edmund optics g41 - 960 mounted on a lateral translation stage ) and through the chopper wheel to produce a pulsed @xmath72 beam that also propagates to @xmath93 .",
    "two concentric sets of wheel apertures are configured such that @xmath86 and @xmath72 pulses emerge non - simultaneously .",
    "the two pulsed beams are incident at a common point on beam splitter @xmath93 where they are angularly combined and `` transmitted '' as a single interlaced @xmath96 pulsed beam .    that pulsed beam is `` received '' at a 1000 mm distant 0.7 transmissive beam splitter @xmath97 .",

    "the total observed @xmath98 beam spot power is @xmath109 @xmath106 .",
    "however , when acquiring the experimental data , selective positioning of the beam spots on the edge of the photodiode , as shown in the fig . 1 detail , results in interception of fractions @xmath110 of the pulsed @xmath86 ( and @xmath72 ) beam spot power and @xmath111 of the constant @xmath98 beam spot power .",
    "the amplified detector output is routed to an oscilloscope ( tektronix tds 1002 ) .",
    "the  @xmath87 interference maxima are centered on the @xmath12 transmissive bands by adjusting the micro - translation stage to give maximum detected irradiance of the @xmath86 beam with the chopper wheel stationary and the @xmath98 beam blocked by the shutter .",

    "however , for local realism an @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 depletion , is well within the range of expected values .",
    "it is of some particular corroborative interest that experimental data acquired with the grating @xmath12 replaced by the `` idealized '' grating @xmath11 yields an @xmath46 not statistically different from unity .",
    "this result is consistent with the eq .",
    "( 4 ) theoretical prediction of @xmath132 and constitutes a significant experimental control .",
    "potential sources of errors have been examined to determine their impact on the measurement of @xmath47 . with regard to local realism , the assumption implicit in eq .",
    "( 7 ) that the final irradiance @xmath133 of the @xmath86 pulses is completely equilibrated constitutes one probable source of error . in general ,",
    "local realism predicts an equilibration between two transiently coupled beams of different @xmath6 that results in a net transferrence of irradiance . that irradiance transferrence is directly analogous to the charge transferrence of coupled capacitances .",

    "completeness of equilibration is also dependent upon the coupling efficiency .",

    "as this angle is increased to @xmath152 mrad , the resultant @xmath153 plateaus at @xmath154 .",
    "accordingly , the mutual divergence angle on the @xmath155 mm overlapping @xmath96 and @xmath98 beam paths must be carefully aligned and maintained for the duration of a series of trials . mechanical instability , transiently increasing this angle , is expected to produce trials for which @xmath156 while concurrently the control value @xmath120 , remaining at @xmath154 , would not provide an indication of these transient angular increases .",
    "a minimal dispersion of @xmath153 is probably the most reliable indicator of stable coupling alignment for a given series of trials .    in any case , regardless of the origin of incomplete equilibration , the experimentally measured @xmath47 would be closer to unity than the actual occupation value and , equivalently , the actual depletion would be underestimated .",
    "we next consider a source of error associated with the fractional presence of the @xmath98 beam spot on the detector during coupling .",
    "( 7 ) , aside from equilibration assumptions , further assumes that @xmath113 and @xmath115 are proportional measures of the respective @xmath86 beam irradiances @xmath107 and @xmath133 incident on the detector .",
    "( the proportionality would also extend to the incident powers @xmath157 and @xmath158 . )",
    "the assumption of proportionality is certainly reasonable for @xmath113 and would seem to be equally reasonable for @xmath115 since the latter quantity is measured relative to the baseline generated by the constant @xmath98 beam .",
    "however , on closer inspection the proportionality is not exact from the viewpoint of local realism and we need to examine the magnitude and sign of the discrepancy .    during coupling , the @xmath86 beam power increases by @xmath159 but",
    "this gain must equal the loss of power on the @xmath98 beam @xmath160 then during coupling , i.e. while the @xmath86 pulse is actually present on the beam path , the supposedly constant baseline of the @xmath98 power incident on the detector actually drops by @xmath161 and the apparent pulse height @xmath162 is reduced since @xmath115 is measured from the pulse peak to the @xmath98 baseline adjacent to the peak .",
    "accordingly , the true pulse height of the @xmath86 beam itself should be larger than @xmath115",
    ". the impact of this discrepancy on @xmath163 can be estimated by inserting approximate values of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath164 into eq .",
    "( 7 ) @xmath165 consequently , the trial value @xmath163 is increased by a systematic error of @xmath166 and an actual depletion of @xmath167 would be underestimated as @xmath168 .",
    "the detector itself presents an additional potential source of error . a systematic measurement error of the relative @xmath169",
    "pair values potentially might arise from non - linearity of the detector output since these values are acquired at different parts of the detector s photodiode response curve because of the absence and presence of the fractional @xmath98 beam",
    ". however , a comparable error would also be present in the @xmath170 pair values .",
    "accordingly , the observed @xmath171 , closely distributed about unity , provides verification of detector linearity .    for individual trials , excursions of @xmath120 significantly differing from expected random variations of laser power output",
    "are indicative of transitory mechanical instabilities of the apparatus.this has demonstrated by temporarily re - positioning the @xmath72 beam spot to the center of the photodiode and reducing the @xmath72 irradiance with the variable attenuator to @xmath172",
    ". the measured power fluctuations over 30 sec .",
    "intervals is a reasonably stable @xmath173 exceeded by the observed @xmath174 fluctuations of @xmath120 for which the @xmath72 beam spot is fractionally incident across the edge of the photodiode . from this",
    "we conclude that the larger deviation of the @xmath120 trial ratios is primarily associated with increased detection sensitivity to transient mechanical deflections of a fractionally intercepted beam spot combined with a long optical beam path of @xmath175 .",
    "an equivalent mechanical stability sensitivity is expected for the accompanying @xmath119 . accordingly",
    ", the modest dispersion of @xmath176 is interpreted as a validation that deviations of @xmath119 from unity are not significantly caused by mechanical instability during the course of data acquisition .    as an additional means of eliminating systematic error , substitution of a different detector ( hamamatsu s2386 - 8k 41 photodiode and a reverse bias network ) produced results equivalent to those obtained with the original detector .",
    "this substitution is tantamount to verification of the experimental results with a totally separate apparatus since quantum mechanics does not allow for irradiance gain of the @xmath86 pulses upon coupling with the independent @xmath98 beam regardless of how those @xmath86 pulses are generated .",
    "the present apparatus is readily reproducible . in this regard ,",
    "virtually all components are widely available .",
    "an apparent exception is the diffractive beam splitter , @xmath77 in fig . 1 , but",
    "any one of multiple alternative devices could be used in substitution to split an incident beam into two beams of equal irradiance .",
    "however , @xmath12 clearly emerges as a critical component since local realism predicts that this grating , unlike an idealized grating , will produce output beam occupation values in conflict with quantum mechanics .    in the present experiment ,",
    "setting @xmath177 , which provides for intrinsic control values , suggests a useful application .",
    "this setting effectively encodes the @xmath86 pulses with a higher wave intensity than those of the @xmath72 pulses , but a receiver consisting of a simple energy - sensitive detector measures the @xmath96 pulsed beam only as an unremarkable set of constant irradiance pulses .",
    "however , a receiver additionally equipped with restorative coupling decodes that higher wave intensity as an increased irradiance on the equilibrated @xmath86 pulses .",
    "it is of some further practical interest that the coupling of the @xmath86 pulses to the constant @xmath98 beam constitutes a direct photonic amplification of those pulses .",
    "from the perspective of local realism , exceptions to the invariance of relative wave intensity ( probability density ) and energy flux density ( irradiance ) are very subtle , and the formulation of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics can be attributed to a presumed universality of that invariance .",
    "that formulation necessarily abandons reality and elevates the apparent wave - energy duality of photons to the status of the central proposition of the probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the resultant compact interpretation is compelling but nevertheless troubling given the abandonment of reality and the imposition of non - locality .",
    "however , combined with bell s theorem @xcite and associated experimental results @xcite , that interpretation is widely accepted .    the representation of local realism presented earlier [ 1 , 2 ] provides a plausible contradictory interpretation not constrained by bell s theorem @xcite and in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the question of quantum mechanical completeness [ 10 , 11 ] is addressed in that representation by proposing that wave entities and energy quanta are independent variables , a proposition experimentally tested here .",
    "the results of this test show a statistically significant @xmath178 energy gain consistent with local realism and in conflict with quantum mechanics .",
