    "displaying 3d content is not only an important issue in the entertainment industry , it is also of increasing importance in science where new numeric and experimental methods have created a wealth of three - dimensional datasets .",
    "many stereoscopic display system are based on polarization filtering : the visual information for each eye is oppositely polarized , projected to and scattered or transmitted by the screen , and finally filtered by the viewer s glasses which consist of two polarizers admitting only the correctly polarized light to each eye @xcite .",
    "there are two options for polarization filtering : linear and circular polarized light .",
    "while linear polarizers are simpler to manufacture , circular polarization has the advantage that head tilting will not impair the quality of the image    an ideal screen would completely preserve the polarization of the incoming light .",
    "however , in practice there is always some amount of ghosting resulting from the change of polarization at the screen .",
    "a measure for ghosting is the system crosstalk @xmath0 .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the intensity of light that leaks from the unintended channel to the intended one and the intensity of the intended channel @xcite . according to measurements of huang _",
    "et al_. @xcite , the maximal acceptable system crosstalk for a typical viewer to still experience a stereo sensation is 0.1 .",
    "( lower values down to @xmath1 can still be detected by careful visual inspection ) .",
    "while it is also known on a theoretical basis that the viewing angle will influence the amount of system crosstalk @xcite , to our knowledge no measurements of the angle - dependent system crosstalk of different screen types have been published up to now . neither has the question been studied how the inclination angle ( between the incoming light from the projector and the surface normal of the screen ) influences the system crosstalk .",
    "a second measure for the quality of a screen is the brightness of the image , which depends on the amount and angular distribution of the reflectance ( for silver screens ) or transparency ( for rear - projection screens ) of the screen . for silver screens this",
    "is typically quoted as the screen gain , the intensity measured at normal incidence normalized by the intensity of a lambertian source @xcite . here",
    "we measure the angle dependent scattering rate @xmath2 for both silver screens and rear - projection screens .",
    "@xmath2 is defined as the ratio of the intensity received by a viewer in a certain angle to the intensity of the incoming light , normalized by the solid angle .    in this paper",
    "we present measurements of the angular dependence of system crosstalk and scattering rate for three samples of silver screens ( labeled ss1 to ss3 ) and three rear - projection screens ( rp1 to rp3 ) .",
    "additionally , we determine the surface texture of the samples using white - light interferometry ; this information provides some qualitative insight into our optical results .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : sketch ] shows the experimental setup used for measuring the angular dependence of the system crosstalk and the scattering rate .",
    "diode pumped solid state lasers ( dpgl-2050 from photop and verdi v5 sf from coherent ) with a wavelength of 532 nm were used as light sources for the experiments . passing a beam expander ,",
    "the diameter of the laser beam was increased to 3.4 mm ( fwhm ) , whereas the typical size of structural inhomogeneities on the screen surface is at most a few hundred micrometers as shown below .",
    "this ensured that the measured data for different spots on the screen are reproducible within @xmath3% .",
    "the laser light was linearly polarized by passing a polarizer or circularly polarized by passing an additional babinet - soleil compensator ( from b. halle ) .",
    "the screen sample is irradiated by the laser at normal incidence and the scattered laser light of the silver and rear projection screens is detected by an detection unit in reflection ( [ fig : sketch]b ) and in transmission ( [ fig : sketch]c ) , respectively .",
    "the detection unit consists of a power meter ( pm100d with sensor s130c from thorlabs ) , an analyzer and in case of the circular polarization an additional quarter - wave plate ( both from b. halle ) .",
    "a long and narrow tube was placed in front of the power meter , ensuring that only the photons are detected that scatter from the irradiated spot on the screen along the viewing axis of the sensor in a solid angle @xmath4 of 2@xmath510@xmath6sr .",
    "the detection unit was placed on a rotatable rail with the rotational axis being fixed in such a way that the normal viewing axis of the sensor intercepts always with the illuminated area on the screen during rotation .",
    "the viewing angle @xmath7 can be varied from -20 to 80 . for silver screens",
    "the range of @xmath86 is inaccessible in order to not block the incoming beam .    in both cases of linear and circular polarization",
    "the incoming laser intensity @xmath9 was measured just in front of the sample .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of the scattered light @xmath10 was measured for the intended channel with the polarization being the same direction as the incoming one ( @xmath11 , analyzer and polarizer parallel ) and for the unintended channel with the polarization being the opposite direction ( @xmath12 , analyzer and polarizer perpendicular ) for different viewing angles @xmath7 . from this data",
    "one can compute the crosstalk @xmath13 : @xmath14 and the scattering rate @xmath15 : @xmath16    the precision of the measurement for the crosstalk depends strongly on the purity of the initial laser polarization , whereas the scattering rate is not affected within our measurement precision . analyzing the crosstalk without any screen sample ( i.e. putting the laser directly in front of the analyzer system ) we found the lower resolution limit in the linear case to be less than @xmath17 . in the circular case",
    "the degree of polarization results in a lower resolution limit of @xmath18 .",
    "the screen samples were obtained from the company screenlab ( elmshorn , germany ) , their specifications and brand names are listed in table [ tab : roughness ] .",

    "the vertical resolution of the instrument is better than 1 nm ; the maximum field of view applied in this study is 1.4 mm . for more information on the instrument",
    "see @xcite .",
    "prior to the measurement the rear projection screens where sputter coated with a 40 nm gold layer to increase surface reflectivity .",
    "figure [ fig : crstk ] displays the system crosstalk of the six screen samples , both with circular and linear polarized light . based on the criterion found by huang _",
    "@xcite , all screens allow stereo vision for viewing angles @xmath7 smaller than 40 ( circular ) or 48 ( linear ) . in practice",
    "this range will be smaller due to the additional crosstalk originating from the glasses and the inclination angle of the incoming light ; the latter effect will be described below .    in general ,",
    "the screens seem to fall into two categories ; they are either optimized for a large range of acceptable crosstalk or a minimized crosstalk at small @xmath7 . in both categories",
    "the silver screens are outperformed by the rear projection screens : rp3 has a smaller @xmath0 at small @xmath7 than ss1 while rp1 has a broader range of acceptable viewing angles than ss3 .",
    "regarding the polarization mode , linear polarization has for each screen a clear advantage over circular . @xmath21",
    "measured at @xmath7 = 10 varies between 1.1 ( rp1 ) and 4 ( rp3 ) as shown in figure [ fig : c_ratio ]",

    "measured on screen ss1 using linear polarized light .",
    ", scaledwidth=120.0% ]    under real world conditions it is quite likely that the incoming light itself will have an inclination angle @xmath22 to the surface normal of the screen . to quantify the additional crosstalk created this way , we modified the experimental setup by adding a periscope in front of the polarizer . figure [ fig : crstk_incl ] shows the crosstalk for sample ss1 in the case of linear polarization for inclination angles between 0and 15 . while there is a clear increase of crosstalk with @xmath22 , the range of acceptable viewing angles @xmath7 is reduced by only 5 .",
    "the scattering rates @xmath2 of the screen samples with circular polarization are shown in figure [ fig : sr ] .",
    "deviations of @xmath2 measured with linear or the circular polarization are within our errorbars . for high luminosities at small viewing angles",
    "ss1 and rp2 are the best choice , in terms of best homogeneity ss3 comes closest to a lambertian source .        from a theoretical side",
    "the performance of a screen will depend both on its material and its surface texture @xcite .",
    "while we do not have information on the electromagnetic properties of the screen material , the surface texture can be measured with white light interferometry .",
    "perspective images of the surfaces of ss1 , ss3 , rp1 , rp3 are shown in figure [ fig : roughness ] .",
    "the rms ( root mean square ) roughness @xmath23 and the ratio between the surface area and the projected area @xmath20 of all six screen samples is listed in table [ tab : roughness ] .    a comparison of the angular dependence of @xmath2 with these values hints at @xmath23 as a predictor for the deviation from a lambertian source .",
    "this is particularly shown by ss3 which has by far the highest value of @xmath23 and the smallest @xmath7 dependence of @xmath2 . regarding the system crosstalk",
    "a similar correlation between @xmath23 and the slope of @xmath0 at large angles might exist .",
    "on the other side we do not find a clear correlation between the optical properties and @xmath20 .",
    "all screens allow effective stereo projection for viewing angles up to 40 . at larger angles",
    "the crosstalk of rear projection screens is considerably smaller than that of silver screens .",
    "also for each screen the crosstalk was larger with circular polarization than with linear .",
    "however , when planing a display system additional factors have to be taken into account like the available space behind the screen or the sensitivity of the system against the viewers tilting their heads .",
    "consequentially , no optimal solution for all possible scenarios exist .",
    "while the roughness of the screens influences their large viewing angle behavior , clearly more research is needed for a quantitative understanding ."
