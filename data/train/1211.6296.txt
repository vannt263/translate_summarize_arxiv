    "the nonlinear front solution , as described by eq .",

    "( [ fkpp ] ) does not account for the shot noise coming from the discreteness of particles and stochastic character of the particle reactions and random walk .",
    "even when this noise is week , it causes the front position to strongly deviate from the mean - field theory prediction .",
    "this deviation has a systematic part  the front velocity shift  and a fluctuating part .",
    "if @xmath10 is the effective number of particles in the front region , the shifted front velocity is @xcite @xmath11 in its turn , the front diffusion coefficient scales as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these anomalous properties of noisy pulled fronts are very different from the properties of noisy fronts propagating into _ metastable _ states . in the latter case the front velocity shift and the front diffusion coefficient both scale as @xmath13 and are therefore much smaller @xcite .",
    "the front diffusion coefficient is determined by typical , relatively small fluctuations of the front position . what is the probability of large fluctuations ?",
    "for negative fluctuations ( that is , unusually slow fronts ) this question was recently addressed in ref .",

    "this theory can be derived , using wkb approximation , from the master equation for microscopic lattice models that involve on - site reactions among particles and unbiased random walk @xcite .",
    "the mft can be formulated as a classical hamiltonian field theory which involves the particle density field @xmath14 and the canonically conjugate  momentum \" field @xmath15 .",

    "it is also analogous to the martin - siggia - rose field - theoretical formalism @xcite for continuous stochastic systems .",

    "( [ ndependence ] ) follows from the second one when @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the first line coincides ( up to the numerical pre - factor which is apparently non - universal ) with prediction from the phenomenological theory of derrida _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . the validity of mft demands that @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "this is the setting we address here .",
    "we present strong numerical evidence that the tfs is indeed the true optimal history of the particle density field , and it yields the leading - order asymptotics of @xmath38 as described by the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) .",

    "notice that the effective number of particles @xmath32 ( which we assume to be much greater than @xmath84 ) does not coincide with the characteristic number of particles inside the diffusion length : the latter quantity is equal to @xmath85 , not @xmath86 .",
    "importantly , the same mft equations ( [ qt ] ) , ( [ pt ] ) and ( [ action ] ) can be derived from the following langevin equation for a noisy fkpp front : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the fluctuating traveling front conjecture @xcite assumes that , at @xmath89 , @xmath90 has the following scaling form : @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 furthermore , the large - deviation function @xmath93 is mostly contributed to by a tfs of eqs .",

    "( [ qtlin ] ) and ( [ ptlin ] ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , the transient time @xmath120 that it takes for the tfs of the complete problem to set in can be estimated from the condition that the diffusion length @xmath121 is comparable with @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , for the tfs to give a dominant contribution to the action , we must demand @xmath122 which leads to @xmath123 now , the macroscopic theory is valid when there are many particles at the leading edge of the front , @xmath124 .",

    "interestingly , @xmath129 coincides with the typical relaxation time of fluctuations contributing significantly to the front diffusion in the phenomenological theory of derrida _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "to test the predictions of the fluctuating traveling front conjecture , we solved the time - dependent equations eqs .",
    "( [ qt ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) numerically without any _ a priori _ assumption about the character of solution .",
    "in particular , the kink - like density profiles at @xmath22 and @xmath23 were quite different from those predicted by the tfs .",
    "we used an iteration algorithm , originally suggested by chernykh and stepanov @xcite for evaluating the probability density of large negative velocity gradients in the burgers turbulence .",
    "different modifications of this algorithm were used for the determination of the optimal history of the density field in several diffusive lattice gas settings , with and without on - site reactions @xcite .",
    "the algorithm iterates the diffusion - type equation  ( [ qt ] ) forward in time from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , and the anti - diffusion - type equation  ( [ pt ] ) backward in time from @xmath23 to @xmath22 .",
    "correspondingly , it demands _ mixed _ boundary conditions in time : @xmath26 at @xmath22 and @xmath27 at @xmath23 .",
    "this presents an obstacle , as the boundary conditions that we specified involve the knowledge of @xmath26 at both @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that the boundary condition for @xmath130 can be replaced by a boundary condition for @xmath119 that has a form of a kink that interpolates monotonically between @xmath131 and @xmath132 . for simplicity",
    "we specified @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the heaviside step function .",
    "note that in this case the momentum field @xmath15 is related to the density field @xmath14 @xcite by @xmath135    we implemented the chernykh - stepanov algorithm using implicit finite differences in iterations of eqs .",
    "( [ qt ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) in a finite box @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "the boundary conditions at @xmath138 were replaced by the same conditions at @xmath139 . because of the finiteness of the box we also needed a boundary condition for @xmath140 .",
    "we checked that the results in the bulk are insensitive to this condition : @xmath15 always approaches @xmath141 at sufficiently large @xmath60 and develops a boundary layer at @xmath142 to accommodate the specified boundary condition at @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , we simply put @xmath143 in further computations .",
    "we found that the implicit realization of the algorithm is beneficial for convergence of the iterations .",
    "this is because the implicit realization guarantees that @xmath144 and @xmath145 for all @xmath60 and @xmath59 , once these two double inequalities hold at @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . for the continuous version of the equations ,",
    "the latter property can be proven as follows .",
    "let @xmath146 tend to zero at finite @xmath60 .",
    "consider a small vicinity of the minimum point of @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 . here",
    "one can neglect all the terms in eq .",

    "similarly , @xmath26 can not reach @xmath84 at any finite @xmath60 .",
    "indeed , suppose that @xmath151 and tends to @xmath84 .",
    "then , introducing @xmath152 and neglecting polynomial terms of order @xmath153 and higher , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ qt ] ) @xmath154 .",
    "since @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( we consider a vicinity of maximum of @xmath26 which corresponds to a minimum of @xmath153 ) , we have @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , @xmath153 can not reach @xmath158 , and @xmath26 can not reach @xmath84 . in a similar fashion , one can prove that @xmath15 always stays on the interval @xmath159 while evolving backward in time .",
    "the data presented in figures [ qp1dt65 ] and [ sqp1dt65 ] were computed for @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "figure [ qp1dt65]a shows the numerically found spatial profiles of @xmath163 and @xmath164 at different times @xmath165 .",
    "one can see that , beyond the boundary layers at small @xmath59 ( for @xmath26 ) and at @xmath59 close to @xmath30 ( for @xmath27 ) , a uniformly translating front develops .",

    "the resulting traveling front velocity @xmath171 is close to the expected value @xmath172 .",

    ". constant front velocities ( @xmath176 and @xmath177 in the respective cases ) and constancy of @xmath178 versus time are clearly seen , confirming the fluctuating traveling front conjecture .",
