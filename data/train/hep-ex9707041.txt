    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been very successful in describing the strong interaction at high energies . within the framework of qcd ,",
    "hadrons are composed of colored quarks ( @xmath7 ) , antiquarks ( @xmath8 ) and gluons ( @xmath9 ) bound together into color neutral states .",
    "the experimentally observed families of bound states can be grouped and described in the framework of the naive quark model in which only three - quark ( @xmath10 ) and quark - antiquark ( @xmath11 ) constructions are used .",
    "the fact that gluons as well as quarks carry color charge in qcd means that they should appear along with quarks as valence particles in hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "qcd calculations on the lattice support the existence of states with valence glue and predict their masses with increasing reliability  @xcite .",
    "the experimental discovery of the glueball spectrum would greatly increase our understanding of the strong force at the hadronic scale  @xcite .",
    "while no gluonic state has been conclusively identified , several strong candidates exist .",
    "good arguments have been made that one or both of the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 states might be a scalar gluonic state or at least mixed with such a state  @xcite . at higher mass ,",
    "the flavor - neutral decay pattern and narrow width of the @xmath14 , also known as the @xmath4 , have led to its identification as a possible tensor glueball  @xcite .",
    "additionally , arguments have been made in support of the gluonic nature of the three broad tensor `` @xmath15 states '' at masses of 2.010 , 2.300 , and 2.340  gev  @xcite .",
    "the jetset experiment was designed to search for such states by measuring the energy dependence of the total and differential cross sections of proton - antiproton annihilations into exclusive two - meson final states .",
    "the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 final states were emphasized because of their suggested sensitivity to specific candidate resonances and their expected small non - resonant cross sections .",
    "incident antiproton momenta from 0.6 to 1.9  gev@xmath19 ( 1.964 to 2.395  gev/@xmath3 in center - of - mass energy ) were used .",
    "the choices of momenta provided both a broad scan of the entire energy region available at lear , as well as a more focused study in the vicinity of the @xmath4 state .",
    "the @xmath4 was first reported by the mark  iii collaboration in radiative @xmath20 decays  @xcite .",
    "it appeared as a very narrow structure with a mass of 2.231  gev/@xmath3 and a width of 0.020  gev/@xmath3 in the reconstructed mass spectra of @xmath21 and @xmath17 from the decays @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the quantum numbers allowed for this state are @xmath24 .",
    "more recently , the bes experiment at beijing reported  @xcite seeing the @xmath4 not only in @xmath25 decays but also in non - strange @xmath26 and @xmath27 channels . in this context a measurement of the @xmath2 cross section in the region of the @xmath4 is of particular interest since both entrance and exit channels have been observed to couple to this state .",
    "a similar measurement has also been reported by the ps185 collaboration at lear @xcite . in combination",
    ", these two experiments place strict limits on the production of the @xmath4 in this channel .",
    "additional motivation for the experiment is drawn from the reported resonances in the @xmath16 system at brookhaven  @xcite in the reaction @xmath28 and from the fact that data on the meson spectrum from @xmath29 in - flight annihilations are comparatively scarce .",
    "data were collected using a non - magnetic detector constructed around a hydrogen gas jet target installed in one of the straight sections of the cern low - energy antiproton ring ( lear ) .",
    "the detector was divided into a forward end - cap covering the region from 9  to 45  and a barrel sector covering 45  to 135 .",
    "each region consisted of the following components : inner trigger scintillators , straw tracking chambers , silicon de / dx pads , threshold erenkov counters , three layers of outer scintillators , and an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "a schematic view of the detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ detect ] .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the detector may be found elsewhere @xcite@xcite . the hydrogen gas jet target had a density of up to @xmath30 at the beam intersection .",
    "lear typically stored between @xmath31 and @xmath32 antiprotons . with a revolution frequency of approximately 3.2 mhz at a momentum of 1.5 gev/@xmath1 ,",
    "this leads to an instantaneous luminosity of approximately @xmath33 .",
    "the fractional momentum uncertainty was less than 0.1% or approximately 0.5  mev in center - of - mass energy .",
    "the prominent feature of @xmath0 events is the relatively long lived @xmath34 which has a mean lifetime , @xmath35 , of 0.08926  ns , or @xmath36  cm @xcite .",
    "this allowed the @xmath34 mesons to travel a macroscopic distance before decaying .",
    "this feature was exploited to detect and identify @xmath17 events .",
    "the tracks made by the charged pions from the @xmath34 decay formed an unmistakable @xmath37 pattern in the detector . the online identification of @xmath34 event candidates looked for these delayed decays by requiring signals in the outer scintillators and the erenkov counters for each of the charged pions while using the inner scintillators which surrounded the interaction region as a veto shield .",
    "this ensured that at least the forward - going pair of pions was produced outside of the target region .",
    "data with the @xmath34 trigger were collected in july and october of 1991 .",
    "the july data set consisted of eight evenly spaced momenta between 1.2 and 1.9 gev/@xmath1 , referred to as the `` coarse scan . ''",
    "the october `` fine scan '' data included seven momenta from 1.39 to 1.48  gev/@xmath1 in 0.015  gev/@xmath1 steps , covering the @xmath4 mass region .",
    "in addition , @xmath34 data at 0.61 and 0.85 gev/@xmath1 were obtained during special calibration runs at the start of the october period .",
    "the reconstruction of events depended on the identification of a delayed @xmath34 decay vertex . charged particle tracks were reconstructed based on information from the straw tracking chambers . to form two independent vertices ,",
    "four tracks were required . an event sample with four or five tracks was examined for vertex combinations .",
    "vertices were divided into two categories : those made of two forward tracks , and those made of two barrel tracks ) owing to this topology was overwhelmed by the increase in background .",
    "no clean extraction of such events was possible . ] . in each event , forward and barrel vertex candidates were made by matching all pairs of forward or barrel tracks .",
    "candidate vertices were removed if the distance of closest approach of the two tracks was greater than @xmath38 cm or @xmath39 cm for forward and barrel vertices , respectively , or if the plane defined by the two tracks did not contain the target .",
    "the barrel tracker straw wires provided modest ( 1.3 cm ) position resolution in the @xmath40 direction through charge division and good ( @xmath41 m ) resolution in the orthogonal coordinates ( @xmath42 ) from the drift - time information . the latter fact was exploited to make a test of momentum conservation in the @xmath42 plane of the barrel @xmath34 decay vertex by requiring that it is possible to draw a line from the interaction region to the vertex , which extends through the opening of the @xmath37 .",
    "barrel vertices failing this test were discarded .",
    "once identified , each candidate vertex was geometrically fit .",
    "the tracks from the fit vertex were followed outward . if either track passed through an inner scintillator , which should have vetoed the event , the vertex was removed .",
    "this eliminated vertices made by random coincidences of tracks which at some point along their trajectories passed the distance of closest approach and other cuts mentioned earlier .",
    "events with less than two independent vertices and events containing photons , identified by the calorimeter , were removed from the event sample .",
    "the momentum of each tracked pion was not directly measured , but was determined through solution of momentum and energy conservation in the event .",
    "this solution assumed that the reconstructed tracks were produced by pions and was based on the measured directions of the particles .",
    "for each event , up to two solutions could be consistent with the kinematics .",
    "owing to the finite detector resolution , a `` violation '' of energy conservation for a candidate solution was permitted up to @xmath43 .",
    "monte carlo studies verified the placement of this cut . for events with no solutions ,",
    "either the hypothesis that the tracks were produced by pions was wrong , or there were other , unobserved final state particles in the event . in either case , these events were removed from the event sample .",
    "a least squares fit to the kinematics of @xmath0 was performed for each event having an allowable momentum solution .",
    "the kinematic fit provided improved precision for the momenta of the pion tracks , and yielded a measure of the probability that the event matched the @xmath0 hypothesis . the @xmath44 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] . for",
    "both data and monte carlo events , the @xmath44 distribution was found to be broader than that expected for an _ ideal _ least squares fit with six degrees of freedom .",
    "this was not surprising owing to effects such as multiple - scattering and pion interactions .",
    "when compared in detail , the monte carlo and data @xmath44 distributions have a nearly identical shape , however with the scale stretched by a factor of 5.5 for the real events .",
    "this factor comes from consideration of the additional non - gaussian uncertainties which are present in the detector but which were not included in the simulation .",
    "for example , the precision of the positioning of the forward and barrel trackers with respect to one another was worse than the resolution of these devices .",
    "further , the true straw - tracker resolution function had to be described by two gaussians , one narrow and one broad . in the simulation , only an average was used .",
    "both effects were studied and were found to contribute to the @xmath44 scale difference .",
    "the maximum allowed @xmath44 in the final data sample was set to 825 which was large enough so that the scale difference did not affect any of our conclusions beyond the systematic errors we report .",
    "these steps led to the following reduction in the number of events .",
    "the fraction of two - vertex candidate events in the raw trigger was @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the fine- and coarse - scan data sets , respectively .",
    "this difference is understood and is described later .",
    "of the 6195 fine - scan and 11,442 coarse - scan events which remained ,",
    "approximately @xmath47 were left once the photon cut was applied .",
    "events with candidate kinematical solutions lowered the sample to approximately @xmath48 .",
    "finally , after the kinematic fitting and @xmath44 cuts were applied 159 fine - scan and 346 coarse - scan events remained .",
    "we estimate that approximately 90% of these events were @xmath2 events as discussed below .    a plot of the invariant mass for the forward vertex versus that of the barrel forbids events with both vertices in the barrel region or both vertices in the forward region , except in rare instances at the 1.9  gev/@xmath1 incident momentum setting .",
    "] is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gh ] for events which , when processed by the event fitting routine , were found to have an acceptable @xmath44 .",
    "the plot is dominated by events in the @xmath17 mass region .",
    "evidence for a small background contamination can be seen in the regions on the high - mass sides of the peak .",
    "the background events are primarily from the @xmath49 and @xmath50 reactions and their non - resonant partners , which can easily mimic the channel of interest .",
    "these reactions have cross sections from 10 to 100 times larger than the @xmath2 cross section  @xcite .",
    "the final states involving neutral @xmath51 are identified and rejected when one or more photons were observed in the calorimeter .",
    "monte carlo studies of simulated background events processed according to the @xmath17 hypothesis confirmed that a small number do enter the final sample and that the invariant mass reconstruction for these events is always on the high side of the @xmath34 mass as seen in the plot .",
    "the number of background events was estimated by comparing the decay length distribution with the ideal one for true @xmath34 decays .",
    "the measured decay lengths , converted to a lifetime distribution , should show an exponential decay .",
    "any deviation from this due to events with charged particles emerging directly from the origin shows up as an excess at very small lifetimes , while the tail of the distribution is unaffected .",
    "the background was estimated by fitting the tail of the lifetime distribution and extrapolating into the region where the prompt @xmath37 decays create an excess .",
    "the exact shape of the distribution for the delayed decays was determined by monte carlo taking into account the full acceptance of the detector .",
    "this method of estimating the number of background events in the sample depends on having a statistically significant number of events in the tail of the lifetime distribution . for this purpose ,",
    "the data were divided into three groups : the 1.6 to 1.9  gev/@xmath1 coarse - scan data , the 1.2 to 1.5  gev/@xmath1 coarse - scan data and the fine scan ( 1.39 to 1.50  gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "even with this division , the statistics in the tail region were limited , and a `` binned likelihood '' procedure based on poisson statistics was used for the fit  @xcite .",
    "the only parameter varied in this fit was an overall scale factor for the monte carlo distributions .",
    "based on this procedure , the event samples contained @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 true @xmath2 events for the three samples , respectively .",
    "[ lifesum ] shows the lifetime distributions for the fine - scan data along with a corresponding monte carlo distribution which has been scaled by the fitting procedure described .",
    "the monte carlo events were generated using the geant package from cern  @xcite .",
    "the geometry and composition of all detectors and relevant support structures were included in the simulation .",
    "monte carlo events for the reaction @xmath2 were generated isotropically in @xmath55 and then weighted according to the second order legendre polynomial fit reported by the ps185 collaboration for their data obtained near 1.43  gev/@xmath1 incident antiproton momentum  @xcite . since the true @xmath17 differential cross section rises slightly at forward angles , this procedure resulted in an increase in the inferred total cross section by an average of 4% compared to what would have been obtained assuming a flat differential cross section .",
    "the monte carlo events passed through the same analysis steps outlined above to determine the overall detector acceptance .",
    "events from relevant background reactions such as @xmath56 were also generated with a uniform angular distribution and were studied for feed - down into the @xmath17 sample .",
    "the integrated luminosity at each momentum setting was determined by continuously measuring the @xmath29 elastic differential cross section at 90  in the center - of - mass frame . the absolute cross section for elastic scattering is well established throughout the energy region of interest  @xcite .",
    "a special trigger , based on pairs of pixels in the forward outer scintillator array , was used to select these events and a separate analysis was performed on this data sample .",
    "a comparison of the acceptance - corrected elastic yield to the published cross section provided a measure of the absolute integrated luminosity .",
    "an additional 15% uncertainty , not included in the errors on the individual points , exists on the scale of our final cross sections and is common for all of the energy points .",
    "this systematic error includes 5% uncertainty on the @xmath29 elastic cross sections . the relative energy - point to energy - point",
    "integrated luminosity is more precise and was derived not only from the elastic event sample , but also from a combination of trigger scintillator scalers which were found to be very reliable and stable for the lifetime of the jetset experiment .",
    "the relative luminosity error was found to be approximately @xmath57 .",
    "the total cross section as a function of the center - of - mass energy was derived by dividing the background - subtracted number of observed events by the integrated luminosity and by the acceptance .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ totaltab ] and are shown in fig .",
    "[ totalxs ] .",
    "the measured cross section is interpreted as the sum of contributions from a smoothly - varying , non - resonant production plus any resonances .",
    "the exact form of the non - resonant component of the cross section , @xmath58 , is not important as it changes only slightly over the region of interest and several functional forms can be used .",

    "if the @xmath4 does indeed couple to @xmath29 at the level reported by bes , then greater than 90% of its decays have yet to be discovered .",
