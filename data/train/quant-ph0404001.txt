    "with the impressive results obtained in the theory of classical chaos , the interest in the manifestations of chaos in quantum systems has grown over the past years . although there is not a clear difference between chaotic and regular dynamics for quantized hamiltonian dynamics , some insight has been gained with the quantization of conservative models with chaotic classical counterparts . among the peculiar phenomenology that has been found we have the appearance of _ scars _ , which are wavefunctions with enhanced amplitude along the paths of classical unstable periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "further connection between classically unstable orbits and and quantum behavior has been given by gutzwiller s trace formula for the density of states@xcite , which has been applied with some success to many hyperbolic systems @xcite .",
    "a connection has also been found between the nature of the classical dynamics , be it regular or chaotic , and the statistics of the energy spectrum , which obeys the general distributions found in random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "however , for systems that include dissipation , not much work has been done .",
    "this is an important subject of study because , besides its theoretical interest , it is of central importance in several interesting applications ( squids , tunneling phenomena , etc . )",
    "the main problem with such systems is the presence of the dissipative term , which makes the quantization process not feasible by standard methods .",
    "approaches to this problem have been proposed by many authors over the last three decades .",
    "kostin proposes the use of a nonlinear schrdinger equation for the process of quantization @xcite , but it has some problems with the superposition principle and yields results of an unphysical nature .",
    "dekker @xcite uses a canonical quantization method based on complex variables , with some degree of success , but the physical basis of his theory is not very clear .",
    "maximal entropy methods @xcite have also been proposed , using a coupling between quantum and classical degrees of freedom .",
    "this approach ignores the effects of thermally driven fluctuations .    in general ,",
    "the only fully successful and physically sound quantization scheme for dissipative systems is the so - called system  plus  reservoir approach , in which one considers the system coupled to a large reservoir or heath bath . since the entire system plus reservoir may be considered as closed , one can apply to it the standard rules of quantization , paying of course the penalty of dealing with an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "dissipation comes about by the net transfer of energy from the system to the reservoir , and thermal fluctuations appear as a result of the random energy exchange from / to the heat bath .",
    "these approaches ensure the non - violation of commutator rules , and include the appropriate fluctuation  dissipation relations .",
    "some common approaches using the system - plus - reservoir picture are the influence - functional methods introduced by feynman and vernon @xcite , that have been used by caldeira and legget to study quantum brownian motion @xcite and dissipative tunneling effects @xcite ; generalized master equations @xcite , used to describe damping phenomena in quantum optics and spin dynamics @xcite ; and quantum langevin equations @xcite , used by ford _ et al . _ to study dissipative quantum tunneling at zero temperature @xcite .    in the area of nonlinear ( and classically chaotic ) dissipative models",
    ", there are some results that point to the conclusion that quantum effects act as sources of noise . as a result",
    ", it is expected that the threshold for chaos be lowered _ in a continuous fashion _ upon the introduction of quantum corrections .",
    "this was reported by graham and tel @xcite , who worked in the master equation formalism @xcite to quantize henon s map , and by cerdeira _",
    "@xcite , who built a quantum mapping of wigner functions for a kicked oscillator .",
    "more recently , cohen @xcite studied the quantum dissipative kicked rotator using influence functionals , while dittrich and graham used the master equation formalism for the same purpose @xcite .",
    "liu and schieve @xcite use the quantum langevin equation approach to show that a chaotic attractor is observed in a quantum system whose classical counterpart is non - chaotic . in contradiction to these works , there were some results showing an increase of order ( a raising of the chaoticity thresholds ) for a kicked dissipative oscillator @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the behavior of a periodically kicked harmonic oscillator , with dissipation , and in the presence of quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "our interest is mostly to find how the bifurcation points and chaotic thresholds in parameter space change when increasingly large thermal and quantum effects are included .",
    "to do this , we generate a mapping of expectation values , using a quantum langevin approach , that has an immediate analog with its classical limit .",
    "this expectation values mapping ( evm ) constitutes in principle a complete description of the quantum dynamics , based in a discrete set of variables , and has the advantage of exhibiting a clear hierarchy in its terms , introducing from the beginning mean values and a sequence of moments of the fluctuations ( the completeness of the description given by the evm will be shown in appendix  a ) .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the classical model , a harmonic oscillator with a periodic  kick \" from a nonlinear potential . in section iii",
    "we will use the langevin equation formalism to obtain a quantal version of the classical map of the preceding section .",
    "the resulting ( truncated ) evm will include both thermal and quantum corrections ; the change in the behavior of the dynamics as function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is examined . in section iv and v",
    "we show and discuss the results obtained and give some concluding remarks .",
    "starting with the hamiltonian for a kicked oscillator @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the period of the kick , we introduce the dissipative force @xmath4 to obtain the equations of motion in the form @xmath5 from now on we will set the units of mass and time so that @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for times @xmath8 , the kick has no effect so we get the equation @xmath9 whose well known underdamped ( @xmath10 ) solution is given by @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given in terms of initial conditions . evaluating these constants , and defining an evolution matrix @xmath15 by @xmath16 we can write a discrete linear map corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ cont1 ] , [ cont2 ] ) @xmath17 where we have set as usual @xmath18 , @xmath19 , with similar definitions for @xmath20 .",
    "we need now to calculate how the kick affects the dynamics , in order to complete the map .",
    "this can be done by integrating eq .",
    "( [ ec_a_integrar ] ) from just before to just after @xmath21",
    ". over this region @xmath22 is continuous and thus we obtain @xmath23 successive application of the mappings ( [ cont1 ] , [ cont2 ] ) and ( [ en1 ] , [ en2 ] ) will give us a map that yields the values for @xmath22 and @xmath20 just after each kick ( dropping from now on the superscripts ) : @xmath24    we have chosen the force acting on the kicks as @xmath25 which gives a potential bounded from below . from now on we will set the units of length so that @xmath26 .",
    "this force is maximum at @xmath27 , so that the closer the harmonic oscillator gets to its rest position , the stronger the repulsive effect of the kick becomes .",
    "we are interested in a region of parameter space such that @xmath28 , and where clear chaotic behavior can be found . after some search ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for bifurcation diagrams given in terms of @xmath31",
    ", we find a well defined transition to chaos around @xmath32 .",
    "it should be noticed that there is some coexistence of attractors in this sector of parameter space ; these attractors evolve from order to chaos following feigenbaum scenario ( see fig .  ( 1 ) ) . for the fully chaotic region ,",
    "the attractors are hnon - like ( see fig .  ( 2 ) ) .",
    "the later map will be quantized in the next section in order to see the temperature and quantum effects on the dynamics .",
    "we use the langevin equation formalism for the process of quantization .",
    "this equation is obtained from the quantization in the heisenberg picture of a closed system given by a relevant degree of freedom @xmath33 , in contact with a large ( in the limit , infinite ) bath of harmonic oscillators @xmath34 .",
    "it is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are operators , @xmath38 is the potential and @xmath37 is a random force that , together with the memory function @xmath39 , depends on the characteristics of the bath .",
    "these oscillators are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at some initial time @xmath40 .",
    "the memory function @xmath39 , and the expectation value and symmetric correlations of @xmath37 are given by @xcite @xmath41,\\\\ \\gamma(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j m_j \\omega_j^2 \\cos(\\omega_j t ) \\theta(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and frequency of the @xmath44th oscillator .",
    "these expressions imply a quantum fluctuation - dissipation theorem . it is assumed that no correlation exists between @xmath45 and @xmath33 or @xmath46 .",
    "this implies ignoring some switch - on processes , which arise due to our assumption that the bath _ per se _ is in thermal equilibrium at time @xmath40 .    from now on , we will use a bath of equal masses and a white ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , @xmath47independent ) , and continuous frequency distribution , which is the case for constant friction or markovian approximation . in this case ,",
    "@xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and eq .  ( [ lang_eq ] )",
    "reduces to the simpler form @xmath49 the drawback of using the markovian approximation is that it will generate some divergences since we now have contributions from arbitrarily high frequencies in the bath .",
    "we will use the same harmonic oscillator - plus - kick potential indicated in the hamiltonian ( [ h_clas ] ) and eqn .  ( [ potencial ] ) . between kicks , the ( underdamped ) solution of eq .",
    "( [ q_eq ] ) is given by @xmath50 where the solution for the non  homogeneous part has been obtained from a riccatti equation and we have defined @xmath51 in an analogous way as for the classical case .",
    "the operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in terms of initial conditions , evaluated at some initial time @xmath54 ( not to be confused with @xmath40 ) , and the inhomogeneous term is @xmath55 for the moment @xmath46 we get @xmath56\\\\   & & + \\omega_0e^{-\\gamma t}\\left[-\\mbox{\\boldmath$a$}\\sin(\\omega_0t)+ \\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}\\cos(\\omega_0t)\\right]+ \\mbox{\\boldmath$g$}(t,\\omega_0,\\gamma),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57\\mbox{\\boldmath$f$}(t').\\ ] ] now we will take the integration limits to be @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so we can evaluate the initial conditions and get @xmath60 with the same matrix elements @xmath61 defined before . defining the fluctuations as @xmath62 we can now write down the evolution equations for expectation values and fluctuations : @xmath63 since both @xmath64 and @xmath65 have zero expectation value .",
    "hereafter we will use non - bold letters to denote expectation values . in order to find what happens over the kick",
    ", we note that @xmath33 is continuous and @xmath46 has an increment , so @xmath66 since the potential term has an operator argument we will perform a second order taylor expansion .",
    "this is the first truncation we need to carry out in order to close the system of equations . from this",
    "we get @xmath67 the potential and its derivatives can now be evaluated numerically since we have no longer an operator as argument .",
    "however in order to have an evm suitable for numerical work , as in eq .",
    "( [ qmap ] ) , we need to take expectation values of all operators . in order to do this",
    "we have to calculate , among others , the map for the fluctuation @xmath68 so that we can evaluate the above equation for @xmath69 .",
    "we proceed by evaluating @xmath68 and made another truncation to second order in @xmath70 , so that we get a map which is also second order . in an analogous fashion",
    ", we obtain the mappings for the fluctuations @xmath71 and @xmath72 and after some rearrangement of terms we have the 5 expectation value maps for @xmath73 and @xmath74 and for the fluctuations ( some details are given in appendix  b ) @xmath75 here the following definitions have been made : @xmath76 and cubic and higher order combinations of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 have been neglected . in principle , a complete description of the quantum map could be given if one could use all moments @xmath81 .",
    "as an extra approximation , a cutoff frequency has to be introduced in order to calculate expressions which depend on eq .",
    "( [ autocorr ] ) , where the divergences introduced by the use of the markovian approximation show up .",
    "we will now use this set of equations to investigate the effects of quantum and thermal contributions to the dynamics of the system .",
    "the parameters and potential used are the same of the classical map .",
    "in this section we present the results obtained using the maps developed in the previous section .",
    "we analyze the shifts that occur in the threshold of chaos for the system as function of the temperature @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we also investigate how the cutoff frequency influences this behavior .    in fig .",
    "( 3 ) a bifurcation diagram for small values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is shown ( small compared with the action and energy scales of the problem ) .",
    "there is , as before , some coexistence of attractors .",
    "these are included using simulation of the map over many different initial conditions .",
    "as expected , large segments of this diagram are almost equal to the classical counterpart ( fig .",
    "there are however , four very important differences : first of all , and quite visible in the figure , there are chaotic regions that appear far below the classical threshold of chaos ( @xmath82 ) . one of them , at @xmath83 , is associated to the second bifurcation of the classical diagram .",
    "it shows a loss of stability for the quantum system in a parameter sector close to a point where the classical system has a zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "this behavior is shown in figs .",
    "( 4 ) , which shows the bifurcation diagram , and ( 5 ) , which compares the largest lyapunov exponent for the quantum and classical maps in this region .",
    "another appears for @xmath31 around 2.5 and seems to terminate a stable fixed point branch .",
    "a similar one appears for @xmath84 ) .",
    "second , and also apparent in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , is the appearance of a hopf bifurcation just before the chaotic threshold for the quantum map .",
    "these transitions are not allowed for the classical system , since is dissipative and two  dimensional . here however , they are preferred over the standard period doubling cascade .",
    "we have verified the appearance of simple non - chaotic cycle attractors , typical of hopf bifurcations , for this transition .",
    "it should be noticed that hopf bifurcations are also present for all other transitions from periodicity to chaos in this map , of which four are visible in fig .",
    "( 3 ) ( @xmath85 , @xmath83 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . )    the third main difference between the two bifurcation diagrams is given by the fact that , although the system is still dissipative , there seems to be no clear bound for its variables .",
    "here we are showing @xmath73 only for a finite interval , but the numerical simulations generate values of @xmath73 as high as several thousands .",
    "this peculiarity affects some chaotic regions but not all of them .    finally , there is no evidence of periodic windows or band mergings inside the chaotic region .",
    "there seems to be no topological changes in the chaotic attractor once the last threshold is crossed .",
    "also , a great loss of detail can be clearly inferred from the bifurcation diagram .",
    "this is of course even more evident in the attractors themselves , as seen in the example given in fig .",
    "this attractor ( at least its projection on the @xmath88 plane ) still resembles the typical attractor for the classical map .",
    "here we are also cropping the figure .",
    "most of these differences are probably associated with the increase in dimensionality of the map , resulting from the use of the evm .",
    "as mentioned , a hopf bifurcation would not be possible in the classical system .",
    "the behavior of the quantum map , for higher values of @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 , is similar to the one already described , except for an expected growth of the chaotic strips .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the attractor ( at least its projection on the @xmath88 plane ) still resembles the typical attractor for the classical map ( see fig .",
    "it of course becomes diffused in the plane , since it is just a projection .",
    "notice that we are strongly cropping this figure , since values of @xmath74 and @xmath73 spread up to the thousandths .",
    "the changes we have mentioned up to now signal qualitative differences between classical and quantum maps . besides these , we have also studied the evolution of bifurcation points and chaotic thresholds due to changes in @xmath1 and @xmath0 , assuming always @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "we have obtained the bifurcation point for the last hopf transition and the last chaotic threshold for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in all cases",
    "it is found that both points are shifted towards lower values of @xmath31 with increase of either @xmath0 or @xmath1 , agreeing with previous results @xcite , which deduce this behavior from the reduction of quantization and temperature effects to an effective noise .",
    "this shift seems to have quadratic scaling in both parameters , in difference with the non ",
    "integer exponent change given in @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising taking into account the strong truncation in the power series we have performed .",
    "the temperature effects can be seen in fig .",
    "( 7 ) , where we plot the value of the potential parameter @xmath31 for which the systems enters the chaotic regime , as function of the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the different curves correspond to fixed values of @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line set of curves correspond to the beginning of the hopf bifurcation where @xmath91 , and the dashed ones are for the beginning of fully developed chaos .",
    "note that even when this curves are not as smooth as the first ones , the general tendency is maintained for all of them .",
    "it can be seen how the value of @xmath31 decreases as @xmath0 is raised , that is , keeping everything else constant , the greater the temperature , the earlier chaos appears in the system .",
    "the cutoff frequency has some effect on the curves , but the general behavior is the same independently of the value of @xmath92 .",
    "the influence of the cutoff frequency is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "( 8) , which shows the same two transitions , for fixed @xmath0 and variable @xmath1 , and in fig .",
    "( 9 ) where it is clear that an increase in the cutoff has a similar effect as augmenting the @xmath1 or the temperature , _ i.  e. _ , it shifts the thresholds for chaos towards lower values of @xmath31 .",
    "the scaling of the threshold and bifurcation values with @xmath0 is quadratic as mentioned before .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "this is probably due to the truncation to second order the whole evm .",
    "a very similar behavior is obtained when we change the value of @xmath1 . in fig .  ( 11 ) , the evolution of bifurcation and threshold points is shown for several fixed values of @xmath0 .",
    "the tendency as before is to have an early onset of chaos for larger values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , a peculiar phenomenon appears here : for small values of the cutoff parameter , this tendency is reversed , and the system gets stabilized when @xmath1 begins to grow , see fig .",
    "this anomalous behavior does not show up when we change @xmath0 .",
    "the kicked harmonic oscillator with dissipation has been quantized by means of the quantum langevin equation formalism , truncating the moment expansion up to second order .",
    "we obtained the evolution maps for the expectation values @xmath73 and @xmath74 and the second order fluctuations @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the most important result we find is that chaotic behavior appears in a region of parameter space far below the classical threshold for chaos .",
    "this agrees with the result reported by liu and schieve @xcite , who also found chaotic behavior in a system whose classical version is periodic .",
    "we also find that the change in dimensionality in the map changes the type of bifurcations in the dynamics , as shown by the appearance of hopf bifurcations on the quantized system .",
    "it should be noticed that this is not an artifact of the evm , since any representation of a quantum system via @xmath96numbers ( wavefunctions in configuration space , elements of the density matrix in any given base , etc . )",
    "is infinite dimensional .",
    "therefore , the reduction of a quantum dissipative system to the corresponding classical system plus some noise ignores the possible effects of this change in dimensionality .",
    "once we are in a finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 domain , a continuous displacement of chaotic thresholds and bifurcation points towards lower values of @xmath31 is observed , as @xmath0 and @xmath1 are increased .",
    "this agrees with most the results obtained up to now in this field , and goes to confirm the rule that states that _ quantization of hamiltonian systems eliminates chaos , but dissipative systems become more chaotic when they are quantized_. this is due to the loss of coherence brought in by the dissipative environment . by now",
    ", there are some experimental confirmations of this rule @xcite . here",
    "we should comment that irregularities observed in the curves for the threshold of chaos in figs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 11 ) are due to the uncertainties incurred in the numerical evaluation of the largest lyapunov exponent for the system .",
    "we are aware , of course , that a second order expansion is not sufficient to reproduce the behavior of the infinite dimensional evm .",
    "hoverer , we doubt that the inclusion or higher order corrections will restore periodic behavior to these new chaotic regions , although it is of course expected that some extra phenomenology will appear with the inclusion of these terms .",
    "we have introduced a cutoff frequency @xmath92 in order to perform some of the integrals .",
    "these cutoff frequency is expected to come from the dimensions of the physical system in a real experiment .",
    "the existence of a cutoff implies a breakdown on the markovian condition , but , as long as @xmath97 , assuming that the system is markovian is not a very strong approximation . in our simulations , we find that this is not a very important parameter except when the obviously inconsistent case when it takes very low values .      if we are given the collection of moments @xmath98 @xmath99 being the density matrix of the system , we can construct the function @xmath100 if we fourier - transform the above equation we get @xmath101 solving for @xmath102 if we want to get @xmath103 in a position basis , we can take the left hand side of the above equation and do the following @xmath104 multiply both sides by @xmath105 and integrate over @xmath20 @xmath106 and obtain the desired result @xmath107 this can also be put in the form @xmath108    in order to calculate the 5 maps for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and its three fluctuations , we will need the following terms @xmath109 we make the following definitions @xmath110 the quantities we need are now expressed as @xmath111,\\\\ f\\cdot h_n+h_n\\cdot f&=&\\frac{1}{\\omega_0 ^ 2}\\left[-2(\\gamma+v''(q_n ) ) i_s\\cdot i_s+\\omega_0(i_s\\cdot i_c+ i_c\\cdot i_s)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the integrals are explicitly given by @xmath112 where @xmath113    the integrals ( [ g1]-[g3 ] ) are evaluated exactly , and give expressions that go like @xmath114 for large @xmath47 . with them , and the given values of @xmath51 , @xmath115 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , integrals ( [ i1]-[i3 ] ) are done numerically , including a cutoff factor @xmath116 to control the logarithmic divergence .",
