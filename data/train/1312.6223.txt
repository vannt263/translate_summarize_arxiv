    "all the spectra are normalized by the intensity beyond 1 ev binding energy .",
    "the spectral changes are most profound in the he i spectra while the he ii spectra exhibit modification essentially at @xmath19 .",

    "5 along @xmath36 direction at 300 k , 150 k and 10 k. the spectra exhibit an interesting evolution across the sdw transition at 170 k. the signature of the hole pocket corresponding to the @xmath28 band distinctly seen in the 300 k he ii spectra vanishes at 150 k with the top of the band appearing below @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the intensity around 80 mev grows significantly in the 150 k data relative to the 300 k data suggesting sdw phase transition induced band - folding of the @xmath30 and @xmath43 bands consistent with the literature @xcite .",
    "such folded band denoted by @xmath47 in the figure appears due to the nesting of the fermi surfaces corresponding to the @xmath30 and @xmath43 bands in the sdw phase .",
    "the signature of the @xmath47 band is also observed in the he i spectra shown in fig .",
    "however , the hole pocket corresponding to the @xmath28-band survives in the he i spectra ( @xmath48 ) , which is different from the he ii spectra ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this reflects the @xmath37-dependence of the @xmath28-band fermi surface undergoing transition from the effective two dimensional nature of the fermi surface to a three dimensional one with the @xmath28-band hole pocket centering around @xmath50 and its absence around @xmath51 in the @xmath14-plane containing @xmath37 axis @xcite .",
    "further decrease in temperature reveals an unusual behavior ; the @xmath28 band shifts further below in energy .",
    "the gradual energy shift is most evident in the spectral density of states ( sdos ) obtained from he ii spectra shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) , where the fe 3@xmath7 states contribution is significantly enhanced in the photoemission signal due to the matrix element effect .",
    "the top of the @xmath28-band moves below the fermi level at 10 k even in the he i spectra shown in figs .",
    "5(f ) and 5(h ) suggesting vanishing of the corresponding fermi surface even at about 9.5@xmath39 , which is close to the middle of the @xmath28-band hole pocket in reciprocal plane containing @xmath37-axis .",
    "the @xmath29-band still crosses @xmath19 , which is observed most prominently in the he i spectra indicating its large @xmath2 character .",
    "treating electron correlation induced effects in the strongly correlated electron systems has been a major challenge in the contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "it is observed that the spectral functions obtained by the dynamical mean field theory often provide a good description of the experimental scenario @xcite . within this description ,",
    "the spectral function of a correlated system in the intermediate coupling regime consists of three features ; upper ( unoccupied ) and lower ( occupied ) hubbard bands representing the correlation induced localized states and a central band at the fermi level , termed as the coherent feature representing the itinerant carriers often captured well by the _ ab initio _ band structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the decrease in temperature leads to an enhancement of the coherent feature intensity at the cost of the hubbard band intensities @xcite .",
    "the temperature induced changes in the valence band shown in fig .",
    "1 exhibit quite similar scenario , where the intensity at the fermi level , well reproduced in the band structure calculations , increases in intensity relative to the intensities at higher binding energies with the decrease in temperature .",
    "effect of the electron correlation is also manifested by the narrowing of the energy bands shown in fig .",
    "we calculated the effective mass , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 = mass of an electron ) corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath54 bands , and found it to be 1.4 and 3.2 , respectively at 300 k suggesting moderate mass enhancement due to electron correlation induced effects supporting the above view .",
    "the energy bands close to the fermi level are the antibonding bands arising due to the hybridization between fe 3@xmath7 and as 4@xmath2 states . while these eigen states possess large fe 3@xmath7 character , as 4@xmath2 contributions appear to be significant , which is observed in the band structure results shown in fig . 2 and comparison of the experimental he i & he ii spectra shown in fig .",
    "3 . since the as layers",
    "are above and below the fe - layers , the hybridization of as @xmath2 states with the fe @xmath55 states will be strong and plays an important role in the sdw phase transition .",
    "this is manifested via the nesting of the fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath30 and @xmath43 bands possessing ( @xmath55 ) symmetry .",
    "signature of the fermi surface nesting observed in the present results is consistent with the earlier studies .",
    "the importance of the coupling of the electronic states with the lattice degrees of freedom has been found in this class of compounds via inverse isotope effect @xcite , spin - phonon coupling @xcite , phonon softening @xcite , sensitivity of the sdw phase to the anomalous phonon dispersion @xcite etc .",
    "the photoemission and band structure results provide a direct evidence of the importance of the hybridization and the electron correlation effects in the electronic properties of these systems .    at 150 k , which is below the sdw transition temperature",
    ", the top of the @xmath28 band appears below @xmath19 in the he ii spectra ( @xmath56 ) while it is still crossing @xmath19 in the he i spectra ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this suggests a @xmath37-dependence of the @xmath28-band fermi surface , which is a signature of the three dimensionality of the fermi surface consistent with the earlier findings @xcite .",
    "such @xmath37 dependence can be attributed to the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase occurring at the same sdw transition temperature .",
    "while energy bands at 300 k are narrower than their band structure results due to electron correlation induced effects , the spectra at 10 k exhibit further narrowing of the dispersions .",
    "we calculated the effective mass , @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath30 bands and found it to increase to 2.6 and 4.3 at 10 k , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the electrons acquire more local character at lower temperatures .     point . ]",
    "interestingly , the @xmath28 band shifts below @xmath19 at 10 k even in the he i spectra as shown in fig .",
    "this is unusual as the he i energy corresponds to the @xmath37 value close to the middle of the @xmath28-band hole pocket . in order to exemplify this point",
    ", we compare the edcs at @xmath1 point at different temperatures obtained by he i and he ii photon energies in fig .",
    "6 exhibiting distinct signature of a gradual shift of the @xmath28 band with the decrease in temperature .",
    "sharp dip observed in the high resolution spectra may be attributed to the shift of the @xmath28 band completely below @xmath19 which means that the @xmath28-band fermi surface disappears around 10 k.    two conclusions can be drawn from the above results .",
    "( i ) although the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic phase occurs at the onset of sdw phase transition , the transition is slow with the coexistence of two structural phases in the intermediate temperature range as observed in other systems such as manganites @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the second observation is the signature of the vanishing of the fermi surface corresponding to the @xmath28 band and its consequences on the energy band , @xmath29 that crosses the fermi level in order to preserve charge count .",
    "it is to note here that lifshitz transition , a transition from a hole - type fermi surface to electron - type fermi surface or vice versa due to subtle change in charge carrier concentration has been found to be important in cuprates @xcite as well as in electron doped ba(fe@xmath58co@xmath59)@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "evidently , such fermi surface reconstruction seem to be important in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 too suggesting a generic nature of such an effect in the unconventional superconductors .",
    "it is to be noted here that a homologous system , srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite exhibits large volume fraction of superconducting region even at ambient pressure if the prepared sample possess significant structural strain . in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0",
    ", it is observed@xcite that a quasi - hydrostatic pressure leads to superconductivity suggesting the importance of structural strain for such exotic ground state .",
    "in summary , we have studied the evolution of the electronic structure of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , a parent compound of the fe - based superconductors employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "we discover a sharp dip at the fermi level appearing much below the sdw transition temperature in addition to the dip associated with the sdw transition .",
    "angle resolved photoemission results exhibit signature of a gradual shift of the @xmath28 band with the decrease in temperature - the hole pocket corresponding to the @xmath28 band vanishes near 10 k indicating renormalization of the @xmath29 band hole pocket to preserve charge count .",
    "these results , thus , reveal signature of interesting fermi surface reconstructions in these complex systems that might be responsible for exotic properties of these materials .",

    "<S> experimental results exhibit three energy bands crossing the fermi level making hole pockets around the @xmath1-point . </S>",
    "<S> temperature variation reveal a gradual shift of an energy band away from the fermi level with the decrease in temperature in addition to the spin density wave ( sdw ) transition induced fermi surface reconstruction of the second energy band across sdw transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the hole pocket in the former case eventually disappears at lower temperatures while the hole fermi surface of the third energy band possessing finite @xmath2 orbital character survives till the lowest temperature studied . </S>",
    "<S> these results reveal signature of a complex charge redistribution among various energy bands as a function of temperature that might be associated to the exotic properties of this system . </S>"
