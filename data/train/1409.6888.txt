    "materials such as the prototypical phase - change compound @xmath0 ( gst ) are in wide spread use in optical storage as well as in electrical memory , a technology envisioned by many as a successor to flash memory . in both cases ,",
    "the large property contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phases is used to store information ; these two states are also referred to as the high - resistivity reset state and the low - resistivity set state , respectively in electronic memory terminology .",
    "detailed structural studies have demonstrated that the large electrical and optical contrast between the phases is a result of a correspondingly large difference between the nature of the bonding of the two structures which requires only local atomic rearrangements to occur .",
    "@xcite in devices , switching between the set and reset state is typically achieved by applying intense , short , nanosecond - order electrical or optical pulses , while reverting from the reset to the set states is accomplished by applying longer , less intense pulses .",
    "conventionally the set state has been associated with the crystalline state while the reset state has been associated with the amorphous state although recently a new variation of electrical phase change memory called interfacial phase - change memory ( ipcm ) has been demonstrated in which both the set and reset states are crystalline.@xcite although it is well known that the application of pulses of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds in duration leads to the formation of a glassy state generated via a quench from the molten state , the application of shorter duration pulses has been suggested to lead to a different amorphization process .",
    "optical pump , x - ray probe experiments using sub - nanosecond pulses have suggested the presence of a transient state originating from intense optical excitation that is different than the equilibrium molten state .",
    "@xcite these reports suggest that appropriate local distortions induced in the presence of a strong optical pulse may lead to faster and possibly more efficient device switching .",
    "lattice vibrations ( phonons ) play an important part in many condensed matter processes including phase - transitions , bond hardening and softening , and melting to name a few . based upon an atomistic understanding of the switching process in gst , it has been suggested that the selective generation of a transient state with the desired local distortions generated via excitation of a particular phonon mode(s ) can provide fast and highly efficient pathways to selectively drive phase transitions eliminating the entropy related time and energy losses associated with switching via the melt - quench / recrystallization process.@xcite recently , selective generation of coherent phonons using a double - pump femtosecond laser was used to switch ipcm material from the reset to the set state at room - temperature , a process which in equilibrium typically requires heating the same material to over @xmath1.@xcite by selective excitation of the @xmath2 phonon mode , an ipcm sample was permanently transformed into the set state with an average temperature rise of less than @xmath3 ( fluence @xmath4).@xcite in addition , femtosecond optical switching experiments on epitaxial films have also suggested alternative athermal crystallization processes may be present when ultrafast optical irradiation is used .",
    "@xcite these observations serve as motivation for the direct study of atom displacement in ultrafast laser - induced coherent phonon excitation .",
    "as a precursor to the control of coherent phonons in gst , we have investigated the generation of coherent acoustic phonons using a fast optical pump and synchrotron x - ray probe pulses . to eliminate grain boundaries , epitaxial gst samples grown on si ( 111 ) were used ; further details on the growth and characterization of the epilayers can be found in the literature .",

    ". the comparatively longer duration of the probe pulse relative to the pump pulse resulted in a corresponding convolution in time in the measured signal .",

    "providing the duration of the pump - pulse is significantly shorter than the phonon period , phonons in phase ( coherent ) can be generated.@xcite the change in equilibrium positions gives rise to a distribution of acoustic cp whose wavelength is centered at twice the film thickness due to the boundary conditions imposed by the much lower optical absorption of the silicon substrate and @xmath7 cap / film interface .",
    "the stress leading to this fast displacement can be written in terms of the contributions of the electronic and lattice grneisen parameters or @xmath25 where @xmath26 represent the grneisen parameter , the specific heat , and the temperature for the electronic ( @xmath27 ) and lattice ( @xmath28 ) subsystems .",

    "the time period required for the gst ( 222 ) reflection to revert to its unperturbed position was on the order of several nanoseconds implying that the effects of heat diffusion for time scales less than 100 picoseconds when the most intense dynamics occur were negligible .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( right panel ) illustrates the calculated strain field as a function of time and depth into the sample .",
    "it should be noted here that the strain field is not uniform and the shift in the x - ray diffraction peak represents an average - like displacement obtained by numerical solution of the x - ray dynamical diffraction equations . as can be seen in the strain figure",
    ", differences in absorption at the cap - sample and sample - substrate boundaries generate large gradients in the relative displacement at the interfaces and lead to the generation of compressive strain waves originating from both interfaces that travel into the bulk of the sample .",
    "the maximum strain is reached for a time @xmath47 given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the film thickness and @xmath43 is the longitudinal sound velocity .",
    "the maximum displacement corresponds to the transit time of the compression wave from each interface to the center of the film .",
    "for the case of gst , this is given by the film thickness divided by the sound velocity or @xmath50 providing excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "while the simulation overall is in relatively good agreement with experiment , discrepancies with room temperature parameter values of absorption length and thermal expansion coefficient are present , that in turn suggest the presence of excited state effects in addition to thermal effects as has been suggested in the literature .",
    "@xcite in general in the ` udkm1dsim ` model , the magnitude of the gradient of the thermal expansion at the interfaces leads to the generation of a expansion wave in gst associated with an acoustic phonon .",
    "this implies that the magnitude of the shift in the x - ray signal along @xmath18 is proportional to the induced temperature rise due to the absorbed light with higher laser fluences leading to larger shifts .",
    "as gst is a well known phase - change alloy with a melting point of approximately 900  k , a transient rise of temperature significantly above the melting point , would be expected to lead to the formation of an amorphous phase due to the excellent thermal contact of the epilayer to the silicon substrate .",
    "this conclusion that there is no melting present is further supported by the lack of a concomitant drop in the intensity of the ( 111 ) peak . as the diffraction peak",
    "is experimentally observed to return to its original intensity after a period on the order of a nanosecond , the formation of an amorphous phase can be excluded leading to the conclusion that the maximum temperature rise must be less than the melting point of gst . to satisfy this condition",
    ", we thus selected an optical penetration depth value that limited the temperature rise to a few degrees below the melting point and increased the thermal expansion coefficient to match the experimentally observed displacement along @xmath18 .",
    "calculations assuming the experimental value of optical absorption resulted in nearly all of the incident flux being absorbed by the gst film leading to a temperature rise of over 3600  k , a temperature that is completely inconsistent with the diffraction peak returning to its initial position within a nanosecond .",
    "an effective fluence value of @xmath51 was used as the experimentally measured reflectivity at 800  nm is approximately 0.5 .",
    "a calculation of the reflectivity using the fresnel equations and experimental values of refractive index and angle of incidence yields a reflectivity value consistent with this observation of 49% .",
    "this approach led to the values of the linear expansion parameter @xmath44 and optical penetration length @xmath45 shown in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "the value used for the optical penetration depth that maintained the maximum temperature constraint is a factor of approximately six times larger than the published value of @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite this large difference from the literature value may stem from either dynamic changes in absorption due to the short duration of the pump pulse , e.g. photo - bleaching or from alternative energy loss mechanisms such as energy transport into the substrate via ballistic electrons .",
    "photo - bleaching or a transient reduction in optical absorption is known to occur for short intense pump pulses due to several factors including bandgap renormalization due to the accumulation of carriers at the band edges and transient increases in reflectivity due to the creation of an electron - hole plasma driven by the electrical field of the optical pump pulse .",
    "@xcite    we have measured the transmission ( not shown ) of 800 nm , 40 fs pulses through a 20 nm thick polycrystalline gst layer .",
    "the absorption constant calculated using the literature value of the reflectivity shows two linear regimes , the first from zero to about @xmath51 and a second from approximately @xmath51 to about @xmath53 .",
    "the slope of the absorption versus input fluence decreases by roughly a factor of three between the two regimes .",
    "note that the peak power in the current experiment ( @xmath54 ) is below that corresponding to the @xmath51 threshold ( @xmath55 ) reported above taking into account the ratio of pulse durations or @xmath56 .",
    "no quadratic dependence on fluence was found suggesting that two photon absorption did not play a significant role in the absorption process in the current experiment .",
    "the underlying mechanism for the non - linear absorption effects in gst has been suggested to be complex @xcite and is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the effects of non - linear absorption have been accounted for by means of fitting the optical penetration depth .",
    "the lattice expansion that in turn triggers the creation of acoustic phonons can be considered to have two origins as described by the grneisen parameter . both the lattice and excited carriers contribute to lattice expansion . for ultrafast processes such as in the current experiment ,",
    "the electron and lattice subsystems are not initially in equilibrium leading to two independent contributions ( and two different subsystem temperatures ) to lattice expansion as exemplified by the electronic and lattice grneisen parameters , respectively.@xcite the more than factor of four increase in the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath44 over the published value  @xcite of @xmath57 found in the current fitting may reflect the contributions of the electronic grneisen parameter to the induced stress in the film . as the system can only expand along the z direction , an increase of up to a factor of three in @xmath44 might be anticipated due to the decrease in dimensionality but , the factor of four found here suggests additional contributions from electronic excitation effects.@xcite although the electron system driven lattice expansion may be transient until the electrons recombine or escape the layer into the substrate , the electronic grneisen parameter can still serve as a significant source of strain in the generation of an acoustic wave . while there is no publication that shows the thermal expansion of gst over a wide temperature range due to the presence of an irreversible phase transformation at about 450 k , there is data published on a closely related alloy @xmath58 which shows a nearly linear expansion from 80 k to just below the melting point.@xcite this strongly suggests that the lattice gneisen parameter ( the relationship between lattice thermal expansion and the lattice specific heat ) for gst is linear and that the need to increase the linear expansion factor in the simulation is a consequence of the nonzero value of the electronic grneisen parameter .",
    "in conclusion we have measured and successfully modeled the atomic displacement of atoms in gst in the presence of coherent acoustic phonons .",
    "a ball and spring model was used to simulate the displacement field as a function of time and the corresponding shifts in the ( 222 ) x - ray diffraction peak . in order to model the experimental data under the constraint that the gst film does not melt , it was necessary to modify both the optical penetration depth and thermal expansion coefficients from their literature values .",
    "the increase in the absorption length parameter suggests the presence of either alternative energy loss mechanisms such as ballistic electron transport or photo bleaching effects due to the ultrashort pulses used .",
    "as the absorption length parameter was thus constrained , the increase in the thermal expansion factor can be considered to be nominally uncorrelated with the absorption length parameter in the fitting process .",
    "the increase in the thermal expansion factor strongly suggests the presence of electronic grneisen effects due to transient electron heating that are comparable in magnitude to the lattice - temperature induced expansion .",
    "the presence of coherent acoustical phonons and their successful observation are a first step in inducing local displacements in a controlled manner that may lead to non - thermal transitions between bonding states in gst . while further studies with better time resolution are necessary to fully understand the role of electronic excitation , a clear contribution of electronic grneisen effects was observed . to attain the goal of using coherent phonons to drive gst between bonding states , shorter wavelength optical phonons are necessary and these studies are underway .",
