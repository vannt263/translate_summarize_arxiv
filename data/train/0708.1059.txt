    "the horizon problem and flatness problem in the standard cosmology have been well appreciated by the inflation model  @xcite ( for recent reviews , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; however , some problems still remain unsolved .",
    "one of them is the initial singularity problem , which is difficult to solve since the consistent quantum gravity has not yet been established .",
    "another one is the cosmological coincidence problem or fine - tuning problem , where the only solution up to now may be an anthropic principle  @xcite .",
    "apart from these problems , we are facing to explain the late - time second accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "so , it has been claimed that the _ dark energy _ defined by the negative equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 is responsible for this accelerated expansion  @xcite , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the energy density and the pressure , respectively .",
    "it can be easily seen from the friedmann equation and the continuity equation that the accelerated universe requires @xmath3 .",
    "note that the density of the dark energy is assumed to be positive so that the pressure should be negative .",
    "especially , cosmologies with @xmath4 have a defect of big rip singularity or sudden future singularity that the scale or some physical quantities become singular in a finite proper time  @xcite .",
    "recently , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that quantum effects can render @xmath4 without any need of introducing ghosts or phantoms so that it is possible to have cosmologies where the equation of state parameter @xmath4 without having big rip - like singularities .",
    "the above mentioned cosmological problems have been studied extensively for a long time . however , they are usually hard to solve exactly and thus some simplified models may be considered in order to get some clues and insights for realistic models .",
    "such models are exactly soluble two - dimensional dilaton gravities  @xcite , especially aiming at various cosmological problems  @xcite .",
    "so , it would be interesting to study whether a simplified model can solve the problems and describe the late - time accelerated expansion or not .",
    "recent works  @xcite show that noncommutative fields make it possible to obtain the transition from a decelerated universe to an accelerated universe without a cosmological constant .",
    "however , in spite of some efforts to obtain the cosmological phase transition , these models have some problems .",
    "one of them is to encounter a future singularity in a finite proper time unless an appropriate regular geometry is patched , or it does not reproduce the first accelerated expansion in the early universe . another interesting model in ref .",
    "@xcite describes an inflation in the early universe , the decelerated expansion corresponding to frw phase , and the late - time second acceleration .",
    "however , an initial curvature singularity still exists .",
    "so , we would like to extend our previous work and obtain everywhere singularity - free cosmological solutions involving inflation , decelerated phase , and late - time second acceleration , where the whole profile is essentially similar to our universe chronologically .    for this purpose",
    ", we shall add two local counter - terms with the polyakov action of conformal anomaly in the semi - classical action , and then impose some modified poisson brackets with noncommutativity between relevant fields .",
    "this process naturally yields modified sets of semi - classical equations of motion involving two noncommutative parameters , and then remarkably gives desired solutions . in the next section , usual semi - classical equations of motion obeying conventional poisson algebra will be derived in a self - contained manner , and it can be shown that the expanding universe is forever without any phase change . in sec .",

    "the curvature scalar in two dimensions is directly proportional to the second derivative of the scale factor so that the universe exhibits a permanent accelerated expansion without any decelerated expansion .",
    "it means that it is nontrivial to obtain the phase transition based on the conventional poisson brackets . in the following section , modification of the poisson brackets  ( [ pb : c ] )",
    "gives different solution showing the desired phase change without any curvature singularities .",

    "the singularity free phase transition appears when we consider the dilaton gravity and the noncommutativity together .",
    "the action  ( [ action : dg ] ) is the s - wave sector of the higher - dimensional low - energy dilaton gravity  @xcite and the quantum - mechanically induced polyakov action  ( [ action : qt ] ) is the s - wave sector of the bosonized four - dimensional fermionic matter  @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the main body of the present model is close to the s - wave sector of the four - dimensional model .",
    "therefore , this model is expected to be partially connected with the higher - dimensional cosmology , although the technical difficulties may arise from the nonlinearity of the higher - dimensional gravity .",
    "on the other hand , it seems that the noncommutative parameters play some important role even when the universe is large .",
    "one should expect that they could play a role only when the universe is small . in this model , unfortunately , the curvature scalar and the acceleration definitely depend on the noncommutative parameters ; however , the space time is flat and the acceleration approaches zero at the infinity , and it means that they are independent of the parameters .",
    "the most leading term of the late time scale in eq .",
    "( [ scale : appx ] ) seems to depend on @xmath56 because of @xmath128 ; however , it can be absorbed by redefinition @xmath129 . in this process ,",
    "asymptotic behaviors of the curvature scalar and the acceleration have been unchanged at @xmath97 .",
    "although the noncommutativity does not affect the geometrical behaviors at the asymptotically infinite scale , it is still hard to resolve this problem in this simplified model .",
    "we have studied the singularity - free phase transition in the semi - classically quantized dilaton gravity by assuming the noncommutativity .",
    "the basic reason for this achievement is due to the role of non - vanishing cosmological constant along with the two noncommutative parameters , which is big difference from the previous work .",
    "especially , the parameter @xmath55 couples to the cosmological constant through the equations of motion .",
    "the cosmological constant with @xmath55 makes the initial curvature tensor finite as seen from eq .",
    "( [ cond : sing : free ] ) , while the other noncommutative parameter @xmath56 plays a role of phase transition as seen in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have regarded the regularization ambiguity as @xmath19 since we can take the two noncommutative parameters to be small . for @xmath17(rst model ) , the noncommutative parameters should be satisfied with @xmath130 for the initial - singularity - free expansion while @xmath131 for the critical case of @xmath18 ( bpp model ) .",
    "note that it is difficult to make the two noncommutative parameters small simultaneously unless @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , one might think that the noncommutative parameters play a role to the non - singular phase transition .",
    "even if this kind of phase transition seems to be interesting , however , the origin of the noncommutativity is still unclear . in a quantum - mechanical point of view , for instance , the noncommutativity is related to the constraint problem so that the poisson brackets for a slowly moving unit charged particle on the constant magnetic field are given by @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . in this work , especially for @xmath18 corresponding to the condition of @xmath131 , the modified poisson brackets are the same with the point particle case as long as we identify @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which means that the present toy model for @xmath137 suggests that some kind complicated constraint analysis should be involved .",
    "final comment is in order .",
    "after lots of dark energy models have been built for explanations of recent observations of the late - time accelerated expansion , there have been many attempts to constrain the dark energy equation of state by observational data sets  @xcite .",
    "as for the constant equation - of - state parameter , there has been a good agreement in the literatures at @xmath138 , and its value approaches @xmath139 for the dark energy based on the cosmological constant .",
    "now , one might think that this cosmological constraint excludes our model since our equation - of - state parameter  ( [ eos : nc ] ) was fixed at @xmath140 . however , this is a dimensional result .",
    "moreover , our two - dimensional toy model is not a realistic one while the cosmological constraint on the equation of state is considered in four dimensions .",
    "in fact , the equation - of - state parameter should be @xmath3 to guarantee the positive acceleration in the four dimensional general relativity .",
    "we hope our two dimensional model can be extended to the realistic four dimensional one in the near future .",
