    "it is well - known that mgms are optimal solvers for pdes of the form , i.e. , they require about a constant number of iterations varying @xmath3 and each iteration has an arithmetic cost proportional to the matrix - vector product @xcite .",
    "such property is obtained imposing a well known condition on the order of the grid transfer operators : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the order of the pde , @xmath23 is the order of the restriction and @xmath24 is the order of the prolongation @xcite , denoted as high frequencies order in @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ cond : ordmgm ] ) follows from the lfa for the two grid method ( tgm ) . in order to obtain more powerful grid transfer operators ,",
    "that is in order to devise an optimal mgm , inequality ( [ cond : ordmgm ] ) should to be satisfied strictly @xcite .",
    "we note that the lfa does not consider the border effects , i.e. , it assumes periodic boundary conditions or an infinite domain @xcite .",
    "mgms for multilevel positive definite toeplitz matrices have been developed in the years looking only to the linear system , independently of the continuous problem @xcite .",
    "a mgm for toeplitz matrices was early defined in @xcite using a powerful eigenvalue interlacing property with the matrices in the @xmath25 algebra ( the class of matrices diagonalized by discrete sine transforms of type i ) .",
    "this first proposal was extended to the multilevel case in @xcite . since toeplitz matrices",
    "do not define an algebra and hence are difficult to manipulate , convergence results are provided using matrix algebra approximations like @xmath25 or circulant matrices having the same spectral distribution of the toeplitz matrices . in other words , we require that the circulant or the @xmath25 approximates share the same symbol of the original toeplitz matrix @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the circulant case .",
    "a mgm for circulant matrices was introduced in @xcite .",
    "furthermore in @xcite , generalizing the techniques used in @xcite , and using the ruge and stben theory @xcite and the perron - frobenius theorem , a complete proof of the optimality of the @xmath26-cycle for multilevel circulant and @xmath25 matrices was proposed .",
    "this analysis leads to a stronger condition with respect to the previous two grid analysis .    in this paper",
    "we show that the techniques used in @xcite represent a linear algebra generalization of the lfa @xcite , in the case of the galerkin approach .",
    "indeed , they lead to a condition analogous to ( [ cond : ordmgm ] ) , but on the order of the zeros of the generating functions of the grid transfer operators .",
    "the letter represents a wide generalization since the case of discretization of elliptic pdes of order @xmath17 corresponds to the case of generating function which are nonnegative ( ellipticity ) , with a unique zero at zero of order @xmath17 ( consistency condition ) . in other words ,",
    "the case of discretization of elliptic pdes is a subcase of nonnegative symbols with unique zero at zero , which in turn represents the case when the algebraic problem is ill - conditioned in a subspace of low frequencies . therefore by using the toeplitz approach other cases can be considered including the case when the ill - conditioning arises in high - frequencies : we recall that the latter characterizes some integral problem related to signal / images restoration .",
    "we will show that considering the problem , the lfa done in @xcite and the toeplitz approach @xcite ( which was introduced independently ) are essentially equivalent . as already stressed ,",
    "second approach is more general since it can be applied also when the zero of the symbol is not at the origin , or there exist several zeros ( multiple sources of ill - conditioning ) . by the galerkin approach",
    ", we have the only limitation that the restriction must be proportional to the transpose of the prolongation , but in this paper we will show that in practical implementations this condition is not necessary .",
    "more precisely , we will generalize the mgm for toeplitz matrices to the case of a restriction different to the transpose of the prolongation . a first suggestion to consider the linear algebra tools for toeplitz matrices as a generalization of the lfa for multigrid methods",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we also define a class of grid transfer operators that satisfy the conditions in @xcite but that are not interpolating .",
    "more in detail the considered operators are defined looking for the smallest support of the symbol for a fixed order and are related to the refinement equation of b - spline .",
    "we will give a geometrical interpretation of the operator of order 4 and it will be compared with the cubic interpolation .",
    "these b - spline grid transfer operators allow us to discuss some relations between wavelets and multigrid methods .",
    "eventually , a numerical experimentation validates our proposals .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly in ",
    "[ sect : lfa ] we present the results in @xcite . in ",
    "[ sect : mgm_toep ] we describe the mgm defined in @xcite for multilevel toeplitz matrices using the zeros of the generating functions and we compare the two - grid analysis with the results in @xcite . in  [ sec : gentoep ] we generalize the tgm described in ",
    "[ sect : mgm_toep ] to the case of restriction not necessary proportional to the transpose of the prolongation . in ",
    "[ sec : b - spline ] we give a new class of grid transfer operators with minimum support for a fixed order and we show that such class is related to the b - spline .",
    "this allows , in ",
    "[ sec : wave ] , some observations about the relations between wavelet and multigrid methods . in ",
    "[ sect : exp ] some numerical results validate the previous proposals both for toeplitz non - differential problems and for pdes with nonconstant coefficients .",
    "the final ,  [ sect : concl ] is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "we introduce a grid transfer operator that is not effective alone ( it has order zero ) , but which is the basic tool for developing more powerful projectors .",
    "it is the classic _ down - sampling _ operator , called _ elementary restriction _ in @xcite and _ cutting matrix _ in @xcite . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "we set @xmath27 , @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 and we define the down - sampling matrix @xmath30 as @xmath31_{j , k } =      \\left\\ {      \\begin{array}{l l }          1 & \\mbox{if } j = 2k - ( n^{(i)}+1 ) \\ , \\mathrm{mod } \\ , 2 , \\\\          0 & \\mbox{otherwise , }      \\end{array }      \\right .      \\qquad      k = 1,\\dots , n^{(i+1)}.\\ ] ] in the @xmath0-dimensional case the down - sampling matrix is defined by tensor product as @xmath32 .",
    "higher order grid transfer operators are defined by convolution with the down - sampling operator .",
    "the prolongation is @xmath33 , while the restriction is @xmath34 that usually is the transpose , up to a constant factor , of the prolongation .",
    "the matrix @xmath35 is the @xmath0-level toeplitz matrix generated by the function @xmath36 .",
    "the toeplitz matrices will be described in section [ sect : mgm_toep ] .",
    "the symbols @xmath37 and @xmath38 should be trigonometric polynomials of low order to maintain the computational cost of the matrix vector product proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "since more powerful grid transfer operators give a greater computational cost , it is important to find sufficient conditions such that we can decide for a fixed problem the cheapest grid transfer operators that allows to obtain an optimal mgm .",
    "this task can be done using the lfa @xcite obtaining the condition .",
    "we define the set of all corners of @xmath40 as @xmath41 . with the change of variable @xmath42 , the set of all frequencies on the fine grid that correspond to the frequency @xmath43 on the coarse grid is @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , according to the terminology in @xcite we define the set of the `` mirror '' points of @xmath40 as @xmath45 .",
    "since in the rest of the section we will consider only two grids , @xmath5 will denote the fine grid .",
    "moreover , for unifying the treatment , a generic grid transfer operator is denoted by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is multiplied by a factor @xmath48 when @xmath46 is the prolongation , i.e. , @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",

    "if a prolongation leaves all polynomial of degree @xmath58 invariant , then both the lf and hf are at least @xmath59 .    for instance the linear interpolation has lf = hf = 2 , while the cubic interpolation has lf = hf = 4 .",
    "furthermore , we can derive the condition ( [ cond : ordmgm ] ) from the following    [ prop : hemk ] given a constant - coefficient , linear differential operator of order @xmath60 , a necessary condition for non - increasing the high frequencies arising from a coarse grid correction with two grids it is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the hf of the prolongation and of the restriction respectively .",
    "from proposition [ prop : ordint ] part _ ( ii ) _ the condition is a generalization of the analogous condition on the interpolation order .",
    "the lf is important for the restriction thanks to proposition [ prop : ordint ] part _ ( i ) _ , but it seems not necessary for the two grid analysis in proposition [ prop : hemk ] .",
    "however , in @xcite it is shown that for an efficient mgm a further condition is that both lf and hf are positive .",
    "this further request arises also from the galerkin approach ( see @xcite ) and is natural for obtaining an effective mgm .",
    "eventually , we note that , since the grid transfer operation has to be computationally cheap , the function @xmath47 in definitions [ def : lf ] and [ def : hf ] should be a trigonometric polynomial of low degree .",
    "moreover , from proposition [ prop : ordint ] a good class of grid transfer operators should have at least lf@xmath64 .",
    "interpolating operators define a class with lf = hf",
    ". a further class of operators with a fixed hf and lf@xmath64 will be described in section  [ sec : b - spline ] .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the mgm defined and analyzed in @xcite for the multidimensional @xmath25 , circulant , toeplitz and other matrix - algebras related to trigonometric transforms .",
    "toeplitz matrices arise from the discretization of convolution operators with a shift invariant kernel and hence not only from pdes , but also from several other applications , e.g. , image deblurring problems @xcite .",

    "the main difference between @xmath83 and @xmath16 is that @xmath43 denotes the frequency for the current discretization step @xmath3 , information that seems to be lost in @xmath65 , but that comes out from the matrix @xmath84 regarding the current discretization ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "for instance , let @xmath9 be the three point discretization of the laplacian : then @xmath86 and @xmath87 . on the other hand , in the algebraic approach for toeplitz matrices the constant factor @xmath88 is moved to the right hand side ( rhs ) obtaining @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "however the information of the order 2 of the laplace operator is preserved since @xmath91 vanishes at the origin with order 2 .",
    "more in general , discretizing with finite centered differences of minimal precision and moving the coefficient @xmath92 to the rhs , by consistency , the symbol @xmath83 vanishes at the origin with order @xmath17 .",
    "convergence results for mgms for pdes are usually obtained neglecting the boundary conditions . in a similar way , mgms for toeplitz matrices",

    "we do not consider boundary effects , thus we will discuss only the circulant case assuming periodic boundary conditions . in such case , in order to maintain the same circulant structure at each level , we have to start with @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",

    "@xmath109 is singular since @xmath65 vanishes at the origin which is a grid point . however , without losing generality , we assume @xmath8 nonsingular replacing @xmath65 with its stabilized version that is by correcting @xmath8 by adding a special rank - one matrix",
    ". this correction is not consider here since it does not imply particular assumptions but it leads only to unnecessary complications in the notation @xcite .",
    "using the galerkin approach , we must have @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "thanks to the structure of @xmath113 we obtain that @xmath114 belongs again to the circulant algebra @xcite .",

    "therefore the main task is the study of the approximation condition for the grid transfer operators .    in @xcite",

    "a common application of the mra is to approximate a high resolution @xmath230 by a coarser function @xmath231 with @xmath232 without losing a lot of information .    in the one dimensional case",
    "a simple scaling function is the haar - function @xmath233 for @xmath234 and zero otherwise , which satisfies the refinement equation @xmath235 .",
    "the haar - function @xmath236 is the simplest b - spline of order @xmath237 , and @xmath238 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath239 .",
    "the b - spline of order @xmath60 can be defined by @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the convolution operator .",
    "for instance @xmath242 is such that @xmath243 and its translated @xmath244 , @xmath245 for @xmath246 $ ] and zero otherwise , is known as the hat function .",
    "we remark that @xmath247 and more generally @xmath248 .",
    "the functions @xmath249 are not centered , but they can be easy centered as previously done for @xmath250 : instead of @xmath216 we take the shift @xmath251 . in this way we define a class of centered projectors such that the symbol of order @xmath60 is @xmath252 the @xmath253 have hf@xmath208 and lf@xmath254 .",
    "as previously observed , we note that a good class of grid transfer operators should have a high hf , while for the lf the only request is lf @xmath64 . for @xmath179 , the @xmath253 , can be obtained using the tartaglia s triangle as in table [ tab : triang ] .",
    "for @xmath255 we take the tensor product of the one dimensional stencil and so on for @xmath256 .",
    ".the refinement coefficients @xmath257 , @xmath221 for @xmath258 in the one dimensional case . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that in practical implementations it is usually required that is satisfied strictly .",
    "this condition in terms of generating functions is equivalent to require that @xmath204 in : the latter is a generalization of a similar condition already numerically observed in @xcite for @xmath111 and when considering the @xmath26-cycle .",
    "indeed , from table [ tab : der4 ] , we see that the choice @xmath259 for the couple ( restriction , prolongation ) is not effective .",
    "we recall that @xmath260 is the linear interpolation . for obtaining an effective @xmath26-cycle",
    "it is enough to increase only the order of the prolongation ( i.e. , @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) .",
    "however , more stable results can be obtained for @xmath263 and @xmath264 according to proposition [ v - cycle ] .    eventually , we compare the two prolongations generated by @xmath265 and @xmath266 . in terms of number of iterations",
    "the function @xmath266 has to be preferred with respect to @xmath265 according to remark [ rem1 ] . on the other hand , @xmath265 has a 5-point stencil while @xmath266 has a 7-point stencil .",
    "this means that the choice ( @xmath267 ) leads to coarse matrices having a bandwidth equal to 7 like the choice ( @xmath268 ) , while ( @xmath269 ) leads to a bandwidth equal to 9 .",
    "therefore , the right comparison should be between ( @xmath270 ) and ( @xmath268 ) . from table [ tab : der4 ] , it is evident that the second one has to be preferred according to remark [ rem2 ] .",
    "moreover , considering the discretization near the boundary , @xmath271 requires less boundary points than @xmath266 .",
    "considering elliptic pdes with constant coefficients , we have shown the equivalence between the lfa and the analysis based on the zeros of the generating functions of toeplitz matrices .",
    "this equivalence has two implications .",
    "the first one is that the techniques used for toeplitz and circulant matrices allow to extend the lfa also to non - differential problems ( e.g. , integral problems ) .",
    "the second one is that it suggests to choose the restriction different from the prolongation also for mgms for toeplitz linear systems .",
    "the generalization of the mgm for toeplitz matrices proposed in section [ sec : gentoep ] replaces the galerkin conditions with the following :      we have given a class of grid transfer operator with minimal support for a fixed hf and the geometrical interpretation of the operator with hf @xmath274 .",
    "such class is related to the symbol of b - spline , giving the possibility to discuss some useful and suggestive relations between wavelets and multigrid methods ."
