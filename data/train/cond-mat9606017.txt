    "the study of the phase behaviour of simple and complex fluids by computer simulation is a subject of much current research activity @xcite . of particular interest",
    "are the critical point properties of such systems @xcite . in the vicinity of a critical point",
    ", the correlation length grows extremely large and may exceed the linear size of the simulated system .",
    "when this occurs , the singularities and discontinuities that characterise critical phenomena in the thermodynamic limit are shifted and smeared out @xcite .",
    "unless care is exercised , such finite - size effects can lead to serious errors in computer simulation estimates of critical point parameters .    to cope with these problems , finite - size scaling ( fss ) techniques",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "fss methods enable one to extract accurate estimates of infinite - volume thermodynamic quantities from simulations of finite - sized systems . to date",
    ", their application to fluid criticality has been principally in conjunction with simulations in the constant-@xmath0vt or grand - canonical ensemble ( gce ) .",
    "the principal merit of this ensemble is that the particle density fluctuates on the scale of the system as a whole , thus enabling direct measurement of the large - scale density fluctuations that are the essential feature of fluid criticality .",
    "the gce has proven its worth in fss studies of criticality in a variety of fluid systems including the lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid @xcite and a 2d spin fluid model @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding its wide utility , however , there exist many complex fluids for which use of the gce ensemble is by no means efficient .",
    "systems such as semi - dilute polymer solutions are difficult to simulate in the gce due to excluded volume effects which hinder chain insertions .",
    "while smart insertion techniques go some way to ameliorating this difficulty , the long chain lengths of greatest interest are currently inaccessible @xcite .",
    "similarly , electrolyte models such as the restricted primitive model show very poor acceptance rates for particle insertions due to the formation of bound ion clusters @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to ask whether one can deal with the near - critical density fluctuations in such systems _ without _ having to implement inefficient particle transfer operations .",
    "the approach we consider here , is to employ an ensemble wherein the total particle number is fixed , but the density is allowed to fluctuate by virtue of _ volume _ transitions .",
    "specifically , we consider how the fss ideas , hitherto only applied to systems with constant volume , may be generalised to an isothermal - isobaric ( npt - ensemble ) simulation .",
    "since finite - size scaling usually rests on the idea of comparing the correlation length with the ( fixed ) linear dimensions of the systems , the generalisation to systems whose linear dimensions are dynamically fluctuating is not completely obvious .",
    "we make a scaling _ ansatz _ for the near - critical scaling operator distributions and scaling fields , expressed in terms of powers of the particle number .",
    "this is then tested via a simulation study of the critical lennard - jones fluid , in which it found that the fss predictions are indeed consistent with the simulation results .",
    "finally we discuss the relative merits of the npt- and @xmath0vt- ( gce ) ensembles for simulation studies of fluid criticality .",
    "we consider a classical single component fluid , whose configurational energy ( which we write in units of @xmath1 ) resides in a sum of pairwise interactions amongst the @xmath2 particles it contains    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the interparticle potential which , for this work , we assign the lennard - jones form :    @xmath5\\label{eq : ljdef}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the dimensionless well depth and @xmath7 serves to set the length scale .    within the isothermal - isobaric ensemble ,",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath8 } \\label{eq : z}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the pressure , and @xmath10 is the homogeneously fluctuating system volume .",
    "the associated ( helmholtz ) free energy is    @xmath11    in the vicinity of the liquid - vapour critical point , the coarse - grained properties of the system are expected to exhibit scaling behaviour . for simple fluids with short - ranged interactions ,",
    "this behaviour is ising - like @xcite and is controlled by two relevant scaling fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 that measure deviations from criticality . in general ( in the absence of the special ising ` particle - hole ' symmetry ) , these scaling fields comprise linear combinations @xcite of the reduced chemical potential @xmath0 and well depth @xmath6 :    @xmath14    where subscripts denote critical values , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are non - universal field mixing parameters , the values of which depend on the specific system under consideration .",
    "the respective conjugate operators are defined by @xcite @xmath17 whereupon , utilizing equation  [ eq : z ] , and noting that @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 , the entropy density ) , one finds @xmath20 , \\hspace{1 cm }   { \\cal m } = \\frac{1}{1-sr}[\\rho - su]\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the particle density and @xmath22 is the energy density .",
    "we term @xmath23 the ordering operator , while @xmath24 is termed the energy - like operator .    for the finite - size scaling behaviour of the joint distribution @xmath25",
    "we make the following _ ansatz _ :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - universal metric factors and @xmath29 is a universal function in the sense that it is identical for all members of a given universality class _ and _ a given choice of boundary conditions . here",
    "we have chosen simply the particle number @xmath2 rather than the volume @xmath30 as a measure of the ` finite - size ' of the systems , using now suitable powers of @xmath2 in the scaling assumption .",
    "the unspecified exponents @xmath31 and @xmath32 in equation  [ eq : ansatz ] can be related to the standard critical indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 by an argument analogous to that invoked by binder @xcite for the ising model in the canonical ensemble .",
    "consider the generalised isothermal compressibility , @xmath35 , defined by    @xmath36    this may be reexpressed as a fluctuation relation by appeal to equations  [ eq : z ] and  [ eq : g ] , whence one finds    @xmath37    from equation  [ eq : ansatz ] , the scaling of the fluctuation in the ordering operator @xmath23 at finite @xmath12 is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is an unspecified scaling function .    now in the critical ( @xmath40 ) and thermodynamic limits ( @xmath41 ) , one requires for consistency that @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly @xmath43 , and matching powers of @xmath2 in equation  [ eq : kappa ] and [ eq : scalem ] then yields    @xmath44    a relation that is satisfied by the assignments @xmath45 where we have employed the hyperscaling relation @xmath46 to eliminate @xmath47 from equation  [ eq : reln ] .    thus precisely at criticality , where @xmath48 , equation  [ eq : ansatz ] can be written :",
    "@xmath49    where @xmath50 is a universal function characterising the ising fixed point .",
    "we note that this scaling behaviour is simply related to that for the @xmath0vt - ensemble @xcite by the substitution @xmath51 . in what follows",
    "we will test the validity of equation  [ eq : ansatz1 ] via simulations of the 3d lennard - jones fluid at its liquid - vapour critical point .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the lennard - jones fluid were carried out within the npt - ensemble using a metropolis algorithm @xcite . in common with many other simulation studies of the model ,",
    "the potential was cutoff at a distance @xmath52 , and was not shifted . in the course of the simulations , three separate periodic systems comprising @xmath53 and @xmath54 particles were studied . in order to minimise fluctuations in the acceptance rate for volume moves , the method of eppenga and frenkel @xcite was employed . within this scheme",
    "the system performs a random walk in @xmath55 rather than in @xmath30 itself , thereby automatically adjusting the step size in the volume to be larger at lower densities than higher densities .",
    "this technique is particularly useful in the coexistence region region , due to the large volume fluctuations .    from a previous detailed simulation study of the lj fluid in the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite",
    ", the critical temperature is known to lie at @xmath56 . using this value of @xmath6",
    ", a number of short runs were performed in which the pressure @xmath57 was tuned in order to locate approximately the coexistence curve .",
    "once a near - critical value of @xmath57 had been obtained , a long run comprising @xmath58 volume change attempts and an equal number of displacements attempts per particle were performed . during this run ,",
    "the histogram of the joint distribution @xmath59 was accumulated .    in order to locate more precisely the critical pressure ,",
    "the ordering operator distribution @xmath60 was studied for each value of @xmath2 . precisely at criticality , and for the correct choice of the field mixing parameter @xmath15 , @xmath60 is expected to be a symmetric function by virtue of the fact that the field mixing transformation restores the ising symmetry of the critical fluid @xcite .",
    "the value of the field mixing parameter @xmath15 and the pressure @xmath57 were therefore tuned simultaneously using the histogram reweighting scheme @xcite , until a symmetric function was obtained .",
    "this occurred for values @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this value of @xmath15 is in accord with that obtained previously in the gce study of the same model @xcite .",
    "the resulting form of @xmath60 for each system size , expressed in terms of the scaling variable @xmath63 , is plotted in figure  [ fig : pom ] .",
    "the non - universal scale factor @xmath64 was chosen so that the data for the @xmath65 system has unit variance , while the exponent ratio @xmath66 was assigned the ising estimate @xmath67 of reference @xcite . also shown for comparison ( solid line ) is the scaled critical magnetisation distribution of the 3d ising model obtained in a separate study @xcite . clearly the data for each system size collapse well on to one another and are thus consistent with the proposed scaling form .",
    "they also agree well with the universal form of the ising magnetisation distribution .",
    "we attribute the small deviations to corrections - to - scaling associated with the rather small numbers of particles .",
    "these discrepancies are comparable in size and form with those observed in reference  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , owing to these corrections - to - scaling , as well as to the somewhat poor statistical quality ( a point to which we return in section  [ sec : discuss ] ) , it was not possible to obtain a reliable independent estimate of the exponent ratio @xmath66 .    a procedure similar to that outlined above was also carried out for the energy - like operator @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", however , there is no symmetry requirement for the critical form of the function @xcite .",
    "however , we found that by assigning the field mixing parameter @xmath16 , the value @xmath69 found in the previous gce study of the lj fluid @xcite , the function matched closely the form of the critical ising model energy distribution .",
    "again the scaling of the @xmath68 with @xmath2 was found to be consistent with the scaling form eq .",
    "[ eq : ansatz1 ] .",
    "the aim of this work was to develop a fss formalism for simulations of near - critical fluids at constant pressure . a scaling form was proposed and tested for the lennard - jones fluid , whose critical point parameters are known to high precision .",
    "good consistency with the scaling prediction was found .",
    "additionally , it was shown that the forms of the critical scaling operator distributions are the _ same _ as those for the @xmath0vt - ensemble ( and hence the canonical ensemble of the critical ising model ) , despite the very different nature of the simulation ensembles .",
    "as is well known , finite - size effects _ may _ differ in various ensembles of statistical mechanics : the microcanonical ensemble , canonical and grand canonical ensembles of fluids are known to have distinct finite - size properties , and are characterized by different scaling functions .",
    "our interpretation of the equivalence of the constant - npt and constant-@xmath70 ensemble scaling functions , is that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath71 , and therefore it is immaterial whether one uses @xmath72 or @xmath73 as the pair of given intrinsic thermodynamic variables .",
    "all that matters is that both ensembles have a single extensive variable ( @xmath2 or @xmath30 ) .",
    "different scaling properties are obtained when two extensive variables are used , such as in the constant - nvt ( canonical ) ensemble of fluids .",
    "it follows that the gce - based fss techniques developed in reference @xcite for accurately locating fluid critical point parameters , carry over directly to the npt - ensemble .",
    "it is hoped that use of this latter ensemble will prove beneficial in situations where the gce is highly inefficient , such as for long - chain polymer or electrolyte models .",
    "we add the further comment that finite - size scaling with @xmath2 rather than @xmath30 is well known in mean - field spin systems , when every spin interacts with every other spin , and geometry and space have no meaning @xcite .",
    "while use of the npt - ensemble is likely to be much more efficient than the gce in cases where particle insertions have a low acceptance probability , we believe that for simple fluids , use of the grand canonical ensemble is much to be preferred .",
    "the present study of the lj fluid consumed circa @xmath74 hours cpu time on a cray - ymp , using a vectorized program . by contrast , the previous gce study of the same model was performed with considerably less computational effort using workstations .",
    "moreover , it was possible to study much larger systems ( comprising up to @xmath75 particles ) , with considerably greater statistical accuracy than attainable here .",
    "the reasons for this difference in efficiency seem to be manifold . owing to the fluctuating volume ,",
    "it is not possible to easily implement a cell structure for efficiently locating neighbouring particles within the cutoff range .",
    "a calculation of all particle separations prior to a trial volume transition involves an @xmath76 operation , which can only be avoided if no potential cutoff is employed @xcite .",
    "by contrast , use of a cell structure in the gce leads to a @xmath77 growth in computational complexity .",
    "a second disadvantage of the npt - ensemble , is that both volume changes and particle moves must be performed . for each particle move , two partial energy calculations are required , while for a volume change ( with finite interaction cutoff ) , a total energy calculation is required . by contrast ,",
    "only particle insertions need be implemented in a gce scheme @xcite , each of which requires only a single partial energy calculation .",
    "additionally it seems likely that for a given @xmath78 the random walk in @xmath30 required to pass from one phase to the other at coexistence is longer than that in @xmath2 for the gce , even if one employs a dynamically adjusting volume step size such as that of reference @xcite .",
    "consequently the correlation time in the npt - ensemble is considerably greater than that of the gce .",
    "finally we note that another recent study has also attempted to apply finite - size scaling methods to the lj fluid in the npt - ensemble @xcite . in this study the authors focused on the distribution of the specific volume @xmath79 and attempted to locate the critical point by requiring scale invariance in @xmath80 , subject to the requirement that @xmath80 has two peaks of _ equal _ height at coexistence .",
    "however , as we have shown in this work , the volume distribution is not the scaling counterpart for fluids of the ising magnetisation , rather it is the operator @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the limiting ( large @xmath2 ) critical point form of @xmath80 does not have two peaks of equal heights , and is in fact highly asymmetic in form , as figure  [ fig : pv ] shows .",
    "we therefore ascribe the rather low accuracy in the estimates for @xmath81 and the difficulties in obtaining the surface tension exponent in reference @xcite to this incorrect choice of the scaling operator ."
