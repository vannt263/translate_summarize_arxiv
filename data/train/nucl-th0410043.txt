    "<S> secondly , the tensor part of the nn potential is suppressed in nuclear matter . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> its negative contribution to the total interaction energy is getting smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to study whether the medium modifications play a similar role , when the quantum fluctuations are suppressed . in order to see the effect of the medium modifications of hadron properties </S>",

    "<S> the results are drawn in fig .  [ qf ] .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm = 6.5 cm    the suppression of the quantum fluctuations leads obviously to lowering the interaction energy per nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is shown in the long - dashed and short - dashed curves in fig .  [ qf ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the quantum fluctuations become weak enough ( @xmath70 ) , the ground - state energy of the system makes it possible for nuclear matter to be in the solid or condensed fcc configuration , as discussed already in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> this is shown by the dotted curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ qf ] .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the structure of nuclear matter in the framework of the medium - modified skyrme model . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the medium modifications of the hadron properties and nn tensor potential are crucial to see whether the crystalline structure of nuclear matter exist or not . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that the contribution of the medium modifications to the interaction energy per nucleon breaks a possible crystalline structure of the ground state of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the present results are stable under the changes of numbers of variational parameters in the lattice - point nucleon trial functions .    </S>",
    "<S> however , one has to note that there might be a possibility that a condensed state at the normal nuclear  matter density could exist within the framework of the medium - modified skyrme model according to the following reasons : firstly , because of the contribution of the medium modifications to the interaction energy , a _ </S>",

    "<S> the dotted curve in fig .  [ qf ] indicates this possibility . </S>",
    "<S> however , we want to emphasize that without the medium modifications one should not conclude the existence of the crystalline structure of nuclear matter . secondly , since it is well known that the binding of nuclear matter results from a strong cancellation between an attractive potential term and a repulsive kinetic one , the present conclusion may be changed if one can include the central attractive nn potential , which is in the present work neglected . for example </S>",
    "<S> , it is asserted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the scalar - isoscalar degrees of freedom are important . </S>",
    "<S> one can include the contribution of the scalar - isoscalar channel in the skyrme model in a similar way as done for the pseudoscalar - isovector channel . </S>",
    "<S> for example , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that the attraction of the central nn potential is modified in nuclear matter in such a way that it is suppressed as the density increases . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that due to these modifications the whole attractive potential containing the central and tensor parts will be lessened . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the scalar degrees of freedom are added in the medium - modified skyrme model , the nucleon effective mass is less changed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the kinetic part on the interaction energy should be suppressed ( quantum fluctuations will be suppressed ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it will be of great importance to understand the interplay between these terms in the interaction energy within the framework of the medium - modified skyrme model , the scalar - isoscalar channel being considered . </S>"
