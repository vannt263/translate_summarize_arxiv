    "the interactions between itinerant carriers and local magnetic moments lead to new magnetic properties in a wide variety of systems that have been the subject of intense research lately .",
    "examples where such magnetic exchange and hund s rule interactions play an imporant role range from ferromagnetic semiconductors such as euo , eus , chrome spinels , or pyrochlore @xcite to dilute iii - mn - v and ii - vi magnetic semiconductors .",
    "@xcite of particular interest here are the manganese oxides ( manganites ) r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 , where r = la , pr , nd , sm , @xmath3 and a= ca , ba , sr , pb , @xmath3 , which display colossal magnetoresistance . @xcite the above systems display ferromagnetic order mediated by itinerant carriers .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to describe the role of ubiquitous three",
    " body correlations ( beyond the mean field approximation ) on the spin dynamics of such ferromagnets .",
    "given the wide variety of such ferromagnetic systems , it is important to understand the properties of the minimal hamiltonian that describes the common properties and spin dynamics . in order to calculate the effects of correlations beyond the mean field approximation ,",
    "it is often necessary to neglect particularities of the individual systems , such as chemical structure and crystal environment .",
    "the most basic model that applies to all such materials is the kondo lattice or double exchange hamiltonian @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the kinetic energy of the itinerant carriers . in the manganites ( r@xmath0a@xmath1mno@xmath2 ) , @xmath6 itinerant electrons per mn atom",

    "we simplify the calculation of the three  body correlations of interest here by considering a single tight  binding band of cubic symmetry and neglect the bandstructure and the degeneracy of the e@xmath7 states ( which may be lifted by external perturbations ) . the operator @xmath8 creates an electron with momentum @xmath9 , spin @xmath10 , and energy @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the system dimensionality and @xmath13 is the lattice constant . from now on we take @xmath14 and measure the momenta in units of @xmath15 .    a common feature of all the systems of interest here is the strong magnetic exchange interaction , @xmath16 , between the itinerant carrier spins and the local spin  s magnetic moments @xmath17 , which are located at the @xmath18 lattice sites @xmath19 . in the manganites ,",
    "these s=3/2 spins are due to the three electrons in the tightly bound t@xmath20 orbitals . introducing the collective localized spin operator @xmath21 and the corresponding spin lowering operator @xmath22",

    "body systems such as the manganites .",
    "although the parameter estimates vary in the literature , typical values are @xmath28 0.2 - 0.5 ev and @xmath29 2ev , which corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction is weak , @xmath31 . the electron concentration",
    ", @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of electrons , varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "ferromagnetism in the metallic state is observed within a concentration range @xmath34 in both 3d and quasi2d ( layered ) systems . in this paper",
    "we neglect for simplicity the effects of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( to be studied elsewhere ) in order to focus @xmath16 .    given the large values of @xmath35 in most systems of interest , a widely used approximation is the @xmath36 limit ( double exchange ferromagnet ) .",
    "@xcite in this strong coupling limit , the itinerant carrier is allowed to hop on a site only if its spin is parallel to the local spin on that site .",
    "the kinetic energy is then reduced when all itinerant and local spins are parallel , which favors a ferromagnetic ground state ( double exchange mechanism ) .",
    "we denote this fully polarized half  metallic state by @xmath37 and note that it is an eigenstate of our hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "this state describes local spins with @xmath39 on all lattice sites and a fermi sea of spin@xmath40 itinerant electrons occupying all momentum states with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fermi energy .",
    "another commonly used approximation is to treat the local spins as classical ( @xmath43 limit ) .",
    "@xcite the ferromagnetism can then be described by an effective nearest neighbor heisenberg model with ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the quantum effects are often taken into account perturbatively in 1/s .",

    "the @xmath46 correction to the spin wave dispersion however deviates from this heisenberg form .",

    "a similar conclusion was reached based on the 1/s expansion.@xcite for @xmath48 , the @xmath46 magnon dispersion showed a relative hardening at the zone boundary in the strong coupling limit .",
    "@xcite given the questions raised in the literature about the adequacy of the simple double exchange model for explaining the magnetic and transport properties of the manganites @xcite , it is important to treat the hamiltonian @xmath38 in a controlled way in the parameter regime relevant to the manganites .",
    "such a treatment would allow us to assess the accuracy of the commonly used approximations and understand the successes and limitations of the very basic model in explaining the experiments .",
    "due to the interplay between the spin and charge degrees of freedom , a good understanding of the spin dynamics is important for understanding the physics of colossal magnetoresistance and transport in the manganites .",
    "several experimental studies of the spin wave excitation spectrum have been reported in the literature .",
    "heisenberg  like magnons were observed in the ferromagnetic regime for high electron concentrations ( typically @xmath49 ) .",
    "@xcite this observation is consistent with the spin wave spectrum obtained in the classical spin limit or by using the strong coupling rpa .",
    "however , for lower electron concentrations @xmath50 , unexpectedly strong deviations from the short range heisenberg magnon dispersion were observed in several different manganites .",
    "@xcite most striking is the pronounced softening of the spin wave dispersion and short magnon lifetime close to the zone boundary , which indicate a new spin dynamics in the metallic ferromagnetic phase for intermediate electron concentrations @xmath50 .",
    "the physical origin of this dynamics remains under debate .",
    "it has been conjectured that the coupling to additional degrees of freedom not included in the double exchange hamiltonian @xmath38 is responsible for this new spin dynamics .",
    "some of the mechanisms that have been proposed involve the orbital degrees of freedom , the spin ",

    "we treat both local and long  range correlations on equal footing in momentum space in order to interpolate between the weak and strong coupling limits with the same formalism .",
    "we treat nonperturbatively in a variational way the multiple electron  magnon and hole ",
    "magnon scattering processes that lead to vertex corrections of the carrier  magnon interaction .",
    "the above two scattering channels are _ coupled _ by three  body correlations .",
    "we show that this coupling is important for the intermediate electron concentrations and exchange interactions relevant to the manganites , while for small ( large ) @xmath51 the electron ",
    "magnon ( hole  magnon ) scattering channel dominates . in the case of the 1d hubbard model , a similar three",

    "fermi sea pair interactions that lead to the fermi edge ( x  ray edge ) singularity .",
    "@xcite    our variational wavefunction offers several advantages .",
    "while local correlations @xcite dominate in the strong coupling limit , long range correlations become important as @xmath35 decreases.@xcite by working in momentum space , we treat both long and short range correlations while addressing both the weak and strong coupling limits with the same formalism . we therefore expect that our results interpolate well for the intermediate values of @xmath35 relevant to the manganites .",
    "@xcite our wavefunction satisfies momentum conservation automatically , which reduces the number of independent variational parameters .",
    "furthermore , our results become exact in the two limits of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we therefore expect that they interpolate well for intermediate electron concentrations @xmath54 .",

    "finally , our results converge with increasing system size @xmath55 and thus apply to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the only restriction is that we neglect contributions from two or more fermi sea pair excitations .",
    "such multipair contributions are however suppressed for large @xmath56 , while their contribution in the case of the 1d hubbard model was shown to be small .",
    "@xcite    here we address a number of issues regarding the effects of up to three  body carrier ",
    "magnon correlations on the spin dynamics predicted by the simplest double exchange hamiltonian .",
    "first , by comparing to the 1/s expansion , rpa , and ladder approximation results , we show that vertex corrections and long range three  body magnon ",
    "fermi sea pair correlations , which couple the electron  magnon and hole magnon scattering channels , play an important role on the spin dynamics in the parameter regime relevant to the manganites .",
    "we find large deviations from the strong coupling double exchange spin wave dispersion , including a strong magnon softening at the zone boundary in the intermediate electron concentration and exchange interaction regime . on the other hand , for small electron concentrations ( relevant e.g. in iii(mn)v semiconductors @xcite ) ,",
    "the electron - magnon multiple scattering processes dominate",
    ". however , even in this regime the deviations from the rpa and @xmath46 magnon dispersions can be strong .",
    "second , by using an unbiased variational wavefunction , we determine the change in the ferromagnetic phase boundary due to the three  body correlations and carrier  magnon vertex corrections ( not included to @xmath46 ) .",
    "the variational nature of our calculation allows us to rigorously conclude that the ferromagnetic state @xmath37 is unstable when its energy exceeds that of the variational spin wave energy .",
    "in addition to the long wavelength softening and eventual instability , which occurs in all dimensions , we find another instability for momenta close to the zone boundary while the stiffness remains positive .",
    "this instability only occurs in 2d and 3d for intermediate electron concentrations ( @xmath57 for the 2d three ",
    "body calculation ) .",
    "this effect is exacerbated by the three  body correlations .",
    "one should contrast the above instability to the spin wave softening ( but not instability ) at the zone boundary that occurs for small @xmath58.@xcite    third , we study the deviations from the heisenberg spin wave dispersion induced by the three  body correlations and vertex corrections .",
    "this comparison is important given the experimental observation of pronounced deviations for @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite deviations from heisenberg behavior already occur to @xmath46 , or even to @xmath44 for finite @xmath35 , but in most cases correspond to magnon hardening.@xcite by comparing our results to the heisenberg dispersion with the same stiffness , we show that , for values of @xmath35 relevant to the manganites and such that the ferromagnetic state is stable up to @xmath60 or higher , the three  body correlations in the 2d system give magnon hardening at the zone boundary for @xmath61 followed by strong magnon softening for @xmath62 and then small magnon hardening for @xmath49 . this behavior is similar to the experiment .",

    "we end with the conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss the four approximations that we use to treat the effects of the carrier  magnon correlations . from now on we measure the energies @xmath63 of the spin wave states with respect to that of the fully polarized ( half  metallic ) ferromagnetic state @xmath47 , whose stability and low energy spin excitations we wish to study .",

    "we recover the strong coupling @xmath46 results of refs , obtained by using the bosonization technique , by further expanding eq.([mag - en-1/s ] ) in the limit @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath46 magnon dispersion is not variational .",
    "thus we can not definetely conclude instability of the ferromagnetic state if we find a negative magnon energy to @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the three  body calculation outlined in the previous section treats the magnon  fermi sea pair interaction variationally rather than perturbatively ( as in the 1/s expansion ) while recovering the @xmath46 results as a special case .",
    "the n  pair contributions to eq.([magnon ] ) have amplitudes of order @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the shake  up of multipair excitations is suppressed for large @xmath56 .",
    "our three  body calculation thus puts the @xmath46 results on a more quantitative ( variational ) basis by treating fully rather than perturbatively all contributions of the one fermi sea pair states .",
    "adaa      to go beyond the born approximation ( @xmath46 ) , we first consider the two  body correlation contributions to the fermi sea pair amplitude @xmath95 while still neglecting the three  body correlations .",
    "this is equivalent to treating the ladder diagrams that describe the multiple electron  magnon and hole ",
    "magnon scattering , while neglecting the coupling between these two scattering channels .",

    "although this is possible in 1d and 2d for fairly large systems , in 3d the numerical solution of the full variational equations is challenging , due to the dependence of @xmath112 on six momentum components . on the other hand",

    "we perform our calculations for d=1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the dimensionality of the system affects the quantum fluctuations and correlation effects .",
    "quantum fluctuations are expected to be most pronounced in the 1d system , where we show that the 1/s expansion can lead to spurious features .",
    "the calculation of the 1d magnon dispersion could also be relevant to quasi1d materials with chain structures .",
    "our 2d magnon dispersion is relevant to the quasi2d layered manganites , @xcite where a pronounced spin wave softening and deviations from the heisenberg dispersion similar to the 3d system @xcite were observed experimentally .",

    "@xcite this can be seen by comparing in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) the rpa dispersion with the different calculations of the carrier ",
    "magnon scattering effects .",
    "it is important to note that , despite the softening , the spin wave dispersion does not become negative ( unstable ) close to the zone boundary for very low concentrations .",

    "body calculation gives such an enhanced effect within the range of intermediate electron concentrations of interest and for values of @xmath35 such that the fully polarized ferromagnetic state is stable for @xmath186 ( where it is observed experimentally ) .",
    "the above behavior of @xmath179 is not reproduced in the strong coupling limit @xmath36 , where magnon hardening is obtained .",

    "our work provides new insight into the spin dynamics in the manganites and can be extended to treat related ferromagnetic systems ( such as e.g. the iii - mn - v magnetic semiconductors ) that are far from the double exchange strong coupling limit .",

    "<S> the manifestations of these correlations are many - fold . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that they significantly change the ferromagnetic phase boundary . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a decrease in the magnon stiffness , we obtain an instability of the ferromagnetic state against spin wave excitations close to the brillouin zone boundary . within a range of intermediate concentrations , </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong softening of the spin wave dispersion as compared to the heisenberg ferromagnet with the same stiffness , which changes into hardening for other concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of these results to experiments in colossal magnetoresistance ferromagnets . </S>"
