    "<S> the temperature dependence of the lsse originates from the spin mixing conductance @xcite at pt / yig interfaces , spin diffusion length , spin hall angle @xcite , and resistance of pt , and dynamics of thermally - excited magnons in yig . </S>",
    "<S> the spin mixing conductance , which is proportional to the lsse voltage , may depend on @xmath54 and @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> the temperature dependence of the resistance of the pt is also irrelevant because it decreases with decreasing the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the lsse enhancement at the peak likely comes from the properties of thermally - excited magnons . here , two scenarios have been proposed for magnon excitation in the sse : one is the pure thermal magnon excitation @xcite and the other is the phonon - mediated magnon excitation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the peak temperature of the observed lsse signal in our pt / yig / pt sample is almost the same as that of @xmath30 , indicating the strong correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath30 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with the scenario of the phonon - mediated sse , where sse voltage is expected to be proportional to the phonon life time in yig ( note again that the peak in the @xmath54-@xmath30 curve reflects the phonon transport ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the recent studies proposed the scenario that the lsse is due purely to the magnon - driven contribution , it is based on the difference in the peak temperatures between the lsse and thermal conductivity , which now turned out to be relevant to the thermal artifacts [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the magnon- and phonon - driven contributions can not be separated completely by the present experiments . however , at least , the presence of the phonon - mediated process can not be excluded because of the similar peak temperatures between @xmath56 and @xmath30 .    according to the previous studies on the transverse sse @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the observed temperature dependence of the lsse can be separated into the following four regions : ( i ) the low temperature region from 10 to 30 k , ( ii ) from 30 k to room temperature , ( iii ) the high temperature region from room temperature to the curie temperature @xmath57 of yig , and ( iv ) above @xmath57 . in the region ( i ) , both @xmath56 and @xmath30 increase with the temperature @xmath54 and then reach their maximums . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency can be expressed by @xmath58 with @xmath59 for @xmath56 up to 15 k , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 in this temperature range is reproduced by setting @xmath62 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the @xmath61 exponents between @xmath56 and @xmath30 can be due to difference in the @xmath54 dependence of the heat capacitance and group velocity between magnons and phonons @xcite . in the region ( ii ) , @xmath56 and @xmath30 start to decrease with increasing @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath30 shows @xmath63 dependence originating from umklapp scattering of phonons , @xmath56 shows the @xmath64 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this difference suggests the coexistence of the magnon- and phonon - induced processes in the lsse , reflecting different temperature dependence of the magnon and phonon life times @xcite . in the region ( iii ) </S>",

    "<S> figure 4(a ) shows the power factor @xmath69 as a function of @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> the low - temperature enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit is in sharp contrast to the typical behavior of the conventional seebeck devices @xcite , the thermoelectric performance of which decreases with decreasing the temperature , indicating potential thermoelectric applications of lsse at low temperatures .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we systematically investigated the longitudinal spin seebeck effect ( lsse ) in an y@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ( yig ) slab sandwiched by two pt films in the low temperature range from 10 k to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the direct temperature monitoring based on the resistance measurements of the pt layers successfully reveals the intrinsic lsse behavior , unreachable by the conventional method . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the magnitude of the lsse in the pt / yig / pt sample rapidly increases with decreasing temperature and takes a maximum at a temperature very close to the peak temperature of the thermal conductivity of yig . </S>",
