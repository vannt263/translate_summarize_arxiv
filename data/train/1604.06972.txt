    "most particle acceleration mechanisms invoked for astrophysical sources must start with acceleration of low energy particles of the background magnetized plasma with a thermal or maxwellian distribution confined in a finite volume with density @xmath0 , temperature @xmath1 and magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "this initial phase of acceleration can produce a distribution consisting of a quasi - thermal component plus a nonthermal tail .",
    "such distributions can be approximated by the kappa distribution ( see e.g. pierrad & lazar 2010 ) and can be the seeds in the so - called thermal leakage injection model in diffusive shock acceleration ( see e.g. haysung et al .",
    "the main goal of this and an earlier paper [ petrosian & east 2008 ( pe08 ) ] is to explore the possibility of producing a prominent nonthermal tail by some generic phenomenological acceleration process .",
    "pe08 treated the generation of nonthermal tail in the distribution of electrons neutralized by a cold noninteracting proton population . here",
    "we evaluate the conditions required for the generation of nonthermal proton spectra subject to similar energizing mechanism using the coupled fokker - planck ( fp ) kinetic equations .",
    "the nonthermal tails in kappa - like electron distributions could also be responsible for nonthermal emission in the hard x - ray regime for hot plasmas ( @xmath3 ) such as in solar flares , as demonstrated in hamilton & petrosian ( 1992 ) , and possibly in the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) of some clusters of galaxies .",
    "many clusters show a significant signatures of nonthermal activity first observed as radio radiation that is due to synchrotron emission by a population of relativistic ( lorentz factor @xmath4 ) electrons in @xmath5 field .",
    "in addition , earlier observations by several hard x - ray instruments indicated that , in addition to the well known thermal soft x - ray radiation , some clusters show excess radiation above 10 s of kev that could not be fitted by a single temperature thermal bremsstrahlung model . for a review of early observations",
    "see durret et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , rephaeli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ferrari et al .",
    "initially the excess radiation was assumed to arise from bremsstrahlung of a nonthermal tail of electrons extending to @xmath6 kev .",
    "however , as stressed by petrosian ( 2001 ) and later rigorously proved by ep08 , this scenario would cause excessive heating of icm .",
    "subsequently it was suggested by wolfe & melia ( 2006 ) that a nonthermal tail in proton distributions extending to 100 s of mev could also be a source of hard x - rays ( 10 - 100 kev ) via inverse nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by their scattering of lower velocity thermal electrons .",
    "this process was also proposed as a possible source of hard x - rays in solar flares ( see review by emslie & brown 1985 ) because of the possible higher x - ray yield compared to electrons . exploring this possibility is subject of our paper .",
    "as we will show there are similar difficulties with this scenario as well .",
    "it should be noted , that in the icm hard x - rays could also be produced by the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cmb photons by the radio producing relativistic electrons .",
    "the difficulty with this model is that it requires a lower magnetic field than indicated by faraday rotation observations ( see e.g. feretti et al .",
    "1996 ; clarke et al . 2001 ) or that expected from equipartition .",
    "reviews of these emission processes and possible acceleration mechanisms are given in petrosian et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and petrosian & bykov ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , more recent observations have cast doubt on the reality of the claimed hard x - ray excesses . in particular , observation of coma by _ suzaku _ ( wik et al .",
    "2009 ) and _ nustar _",
    "( wik et al . 2014 ) , and the bullet cluster ( astaldello et al . 2015 ) give only upper limits consistent with the claimed relatively high magnetic fields from faraday rotation measurements .",
    "the non - detection of many clusters by _",
    "fermi_-lat ( ackermann et al . 2011 and 2014 ; huber et al . 2011 ) supports this view and puts stringent constraints on population of high energy cosmic rays that may be produced in the shocks arising from mergers during large scale structure formations ( see recent review by brunetti & jones 2014 ) .",
    "the crucial feature in production of nonthermal electron or proton tails is the interplay between the particle - particle ( and particle - external fields ) interactions that causes energy loss and momentum diffusion , and the acceleration or energizing mechanism due to interaction of particles with plasma turbulence and/or converging flows ( e.g. shocks ) . for nonrelativistic background plasma",
    "@xmath7 k the energy loss is dominated by coulomb collisions , which tend to equilibrate electrons and protons distribution to a single temperature maxwellian .",
    "acceleration rates lower than the coulomb rates ( i.e. with longer timescales ) tend to only heat the plasma and higher acceleration rates lead to a runaway distributions . thus , for production of significant but not excessive nonthermal population we need acceleration rates comparable to the coulomb rates , so that in ep08 , dealing with acceleration of electrons only , we used acceleration timescales comparable to electron - electron ( e - e ) coulomb times .",
    "since the latter are much shorter than that of electron - proton ( e - p ) ( and proton - proton ( p - p ) ) collision times at all energies protons remained decoupled and kept their initial distribution .",
    "as shown in pe08 , production of nonthermal electron tails required special conditions , at least for icm conditions where one needs to maintain a relatively constant temperatures of @xmath8 kev over a hubble time .",
    "this is not an issue for short lived solar flares ( hamilton & petrosian 1992 ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated for protons because the longer p - p collisional time requires a longer acceleration time .",
    "such a rate for electrons would lead to their heating .",
    "therefore , we assume no , or much lower rate of acceleration of electrons .",
    "this can come about for pure alfvnic turbulence which do not interact with low energy electrons .",
    "( low energy electrons interact with the whistler waves of the fast mode branch . )",
    "however , this does not mean that electrons can be de - coupled from protons .",
    "this is because proton - electron ( p - e ) and p - p collision times can be comparable , so that some of the energy gained by protons can be transfered to electrons .",
    "therefore , we must treat the _ coupled electron and proton kinetic equations _ simultaneously .",
    "in addition , the energy dependence of the acceleration rate also plays an important role with acceleration rates increasing with energy being more efficient in producing nonthermal tails .    in  2 , we derive and present coefficients for coulomb interactions and stochastic acceleration to be used in a fokker - plank ( fp ) kinetic equation , and explain our algorithm for solving the coupled fp equations of protons and electrons . in  3",
    ", we apply the algorithm to the stochastic acceleration of thermal background particles , and examine the time evolution of the proton and electron distributions for various acceleration model parameters . in  4 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "some details of the acceleration and a new formula for proton inelastic energy loss rate due to pion production are presented in the appendixes .",
    "in order to compute the time evolution of the proton and electron distributions when the two species of particles interact not only internally but also mutually via coulomb collisions , we need to solve their coupled kinetic equations .",
    "we use the fp kinetic equation using the following simplifying assumptions .",
    "we assume a magnetized background plasma where particles are tied to magnetic field lines and undergo momentum and pitch angle diffusion .",
    "we also assume that the mean free path for scattering is much smaller than the size of the region which means that particle momentum distribution is isotropic .",
    "we further assume that the system is closed ; that is , there is no escape or injection of particles . in this case",
    "the pitch angle - averaged , spatially - integrated momentum distribution @xmath9 satisfies the simple equation @xmath10/\\partial p$ ] . for convenience",
    "we use the energy distribution defined as @xmath11 to obtain the following commonly used two forms of the kinetic equation :    @xmath12}{\\partial e}=\\frac{\\partial^2(d_{\\rm ee}n)}{\\partial e^2 } -\\frac{\\partial [ { \\tilde a}(e)n]}{\\partial e},\\ ] ]    where the energy diffusion coefficient and the direct energy gain ( or loss ) rates are given as    [ coeffs ] d_ee=^2d_ppand a(e)=d_ee / e with = . here",
    "@xmath13 is the particle velocity @xmath14 in unit of the speed of light @xmath15 and the lorentz factor @xmath16 . as shown in petrosian & chen ( 2015 )",
    "( see also tsytovich , 1977 ) @xmath17 provides a more accurate representation of energy gain ( or coulomb energy loss ) rate than @xmath18 .    in",
    "what follows we will present results from numerical solutions of the first form of the above fp equation including the effects of stochastic acceleration ( sa ) by turbulence and coulomb collision .",
    "we will assume a background plasma of constant density @xmath0 and @xmath2 field ( but not temperature @xmath1 ) , and a constant energy level and spectrum of turbulence so that the transport coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant in time .",
    "following pe08 we use the simple form @xmath21,\\ ] ] or the characteristic acceleration time scale @xmath22 described by the three parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the thin black ( solid and dotted ) curves in figure [ ac - losst ] show some examples of acceleration times used in the next section .",
    "as described above , @xmath24 , which is a measure of the acceleration time , should be comparable to the relevant collision times and @xmath25 allows to introduce a break in the energy dependence of the acceleration rate ( making it steeper or flatter at higher energies depending on the value of the index @xmath23 )",
    ". the break will be important only for low values of @xmath25 and will have little effect for @xmath26 .",
    "for sa by turbulence the index @xmath23 is related to the spectral index @xmath27 of turbulence . for relativistic energies and alfvnic turbulence @xmath28 . in the inertial range one expects a kolmogorov or kraichnin spectrum with @xmath29 or 3/2 so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "but the turbulence spectrum is expected to be steeper in the damping range at smaller scales ( large wave vectors ) where @xmath23 may become positive . at lower energies",
    "this relation becomes more complicated as interactions with many other modes become important ( see e.g pryadko & petrosian 1997 and petrosian & liu 2004 ) . in what follows we will use @xmath32 to include all possible cases .",
    "in the cold target approximation , in which a test particle of charge @xmath33 , mass @xmath34 , and velocity @xmath35 collides with stationary target particles of charge @xmath36 , mass @xmath37 and number density @xmath38 , the coulomb energy diffusion rate is negligible but the coulomb energy loss rate @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coulomb logarithm . in",
    "what follows we will be interested in electron and proton test particles with @xmath41 .",
    "in most astrophysical situations we are dealing with fully ionized ions so the primary target particles are electrons and protons so @xmath42 also .",
    "contributions to coulomb losses from other ions are negligible except from alpha particles with a relative number density @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which may contribute up to 20 % .",
    "note that this also means that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if we define @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the classical electron radius , then @xmath49 the cold target approximation can be used for test particle energies @xmath50 of the background plasma . for interaction with a thermal background plasma with temperature @xmath1 ,",
    "when the test particle energy @xmath51 approaches @xmath52 , we must use the hot plasma energy exchange rates which yields a finite energy diffusion rate and can be an energy gain when @xmath53 .",
    "in pe08 we used hot plasma rate equations for nonrelativistic electrons given e.g. by miller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and nayakshin & melia ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we are interested on interactions of both electrons and protons .",
    "this requires generalization of the two functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 of pe08 that describe the loss and diffusion rates , respectively , as follows :    generalization of equation ( 7 ) in ep08 gives @xmath56 the meaning of @xmath57 is clear ; if the test particle is faster than the target particle , it will lose energy to the target particle according to cold coulomb loss rate .",
    "conversely , if it is slower than the target particle , it will gain energy from the target particle .",
    "from this we can calculate the energy exchange rate ( positive for loss , negative for gain ) @xmath58 by integrating @xmath57 over the distribution @xmath59 of the target particles : @xmath60    in a similar manner , we derive the corresponding coulomb diffusion coefficient @xmath61 .",

    "when the number of particles in the nonthermal component of @xmath59 is much less than that of the thermal component we can approximate the distribution of the target particles by the nonrelativistic maxwellian form @xmath67 which then yields the hot coulomb coefficients ^_ij(e ) -a_coul^hot =( ) ( ) , [ edothot ] and d^_ij(e ) ( ) ( ) kt , [ dhot ] where @xmath68 and erf stands for the error function .",

    "effects of 8% by number of he in a fully ionized plasma are included . at @xmath72",
    "the effective coulomb loss timescale diverges ( see equation.(@xmath73 ) ) , and for @xmath74 the test particle actually gains energy ( i.e. @xmath75 ) .",
    "the lines below this energy show the timescales using the absolute values of the loss rate . note that even though we have used the non - relativistic approximation at low energies these timescales give the correct results in the relativistic regime where the masses of test particles are irrelevant .",
    "the thin solid ( for @xmath76 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath77 ) and dotted ( black ) curves ( for @xmath78 and @xmath77 ) give several examples of the acceleration time according to equation ( [ taccel ] ) .",

    "this means that the coulomb energy loss rate should also be transformed to @xmath80 or @xmath81 note that at @xmath82 the effective coulomb loss timescale diverges and for @xmath83 the rate @xmath75 which means that the test particle actually gains energy from the target particles .",
    "figure [ ac - losst ] shows the effective coulomb loss timescales , defined as @xmath70 , as a function of @xmath84 for the four different pairs of the test and target particles ( e - e , p - p , e - p , p - e ) .",
    "particles with @xmath85 does not change @xmath86 and @xmath87 but increases @xmath88 and @xmath87 by 1.16 . adding losses to @xmath89 particles",
    "reduces the two latter times by 8% ( to 1.07 ) at relativistic energies and @xmath88 by 10 to 30% around @xmath90 .",
    "these effects are included in figure [ ac - losst ] .",
    "] there are several features in these equation that deserve some discussion .    1 .",
    "the first feature is that , these rates and timescales , although obtained using the nonrelativistic maxwellian distribution approximation , give the correct ( cold target ) loss timescales for test particles with @xmath91 .",
    "these forms of the coulomb rates also satisfy the time - independent fp equations for both species of particles , when their distributions are maxwellian of the same temperature ( see appendix a ) and as shown in appendix b they conserve energy .",
    "3 .   as also can be deduced from the above equations the shapes of the timescales shown in figure [ ac - losst ] are invariant and independent of @xmath69 but they scale with the temperature of the target particles as @xmath92 ( see appendix c ) . thus , although for the purpose of comparison with the acceleration timescale we have used @xmath93 kev , the loss times as scaled in the vertical axis are valid for all temperatures .",
    "4 .   finally",
    "the relative values of the timescales play an important role .",
    "when electrons are energized the acceleration timescale should be comparable to the shortest e - e collision loss time . in this case",
    "the electrons gain energy but share very little of it with protons since e - p timescale is @xmath94 times longer .",
    "but as electrons are heated the e - e timescale increases as @xmath95 and when @xmath96 some of the energy goes into protons .",
    "this is why ep08 , limiting their calculations to lower temperatures , did not need to deal with a coupled kinetic equation . on the other hand ,",
    "when protons are energized , which is the case we are considering here , the initial phase is similar ( p - p time is shorter than p - e ) and only protons gain energy .",
    "however , as can be seen from figure [ ac - losst ] , once the proton temperature increases by a factor less than ten the p - e interactions become important and some of the energy goes to electrons which are thermalized quickly because of much shorter e - e timescale . for this reason , as stated above , we need to solve the more complex coupled fp kinetic equations of protons and electrons even though the acceleration mechanism is energizing only the protons . the new algorithm used for this case",
    "is described next .",
    "the algorithm we adapt iteratively solves the coupled fp equations of protons and electrons interacting via coulomb collisions with only proton subject to sa .",
    "the coupling arises from the fact that the energy lost to electrons by protons @xmath97 gives the heating rate of electrons and vice versa . at each time",
    "iteration step the algorithm uses the coulomb coefficients calculated based on particle distributions obtained in the previous time step .",
    "pe08 fitted the distributions in each step to a maxwellian with `` effective temperatures '' and used the hot plasma equations ( [ edothot ] ) and ( [ dhot ] ) to calculate the coulomb collision coefficients .",
    "this clearly is a reasonable approximation when the distributions are nearly isothermal and saves considerable computing time .",
    "however , for particle distributions with strong nonthermal tails that are of interest here this may not be a good approximation .",
    "moreover , when two species are involved it becomes more complicated to determine their respective effective temperatures .",
    "_ for these reasons , we use the more accurate but the more time consuming algorithm whereby at each time step we calculate the coulomb collision coefficients by integrating the more exact equations ( [ edotint ] ) and ( [ dint ] ) over the particle distributions determined from solution of the coupled fp equation at the previous time step .",
    "_ several tests of the integrity of this algorithm are presented in appendix c.",
    "in this section we show the results from using the above relations and algorithm to investigate whether sa can generate a significant and discernible nonthermal proton tail without excessively heating the plasma .",
    "we assume that protons and electrons are both initially in equilibrium with maxwellian distribution of @xmath98 , and interact both internally and mutually via coulomb collisions while protons undergo sa by turbulence . as explained in ",

    "the left panel shows the later time evolution of the proton spectrum for the model @xmath112 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "although the spectrum at @xmath136 = @xmath137 exhibits a promising nonthermal tail and temperature that is only few times larger than @xmath138 , its shape changes rapidly as a considerable fraction of the protons are accelerated beyond @xmath25 . by the time @xmath136",

    "as expected from the discussion in  2.2 , the electron spectrum , in every case considered above , remains nearly thermal with its temperature being usually smaller than that of the proton thermal component during the early times .",
    "but once the proton energy exceeds 20 kev p - e interactions become important and electrons are quickly heated to proton temperatures .",
    "this is true regardless of how nonthermal the proton spectrum is . in figure",
    "[ fig : paccelele ] we show the evolution of the electron spectra for for the same models shown in figure [ fig : paccellate ] . as expected , in some cases and later times ( when @xmath145 ) the electron temperature could be much larger than that of the proton thermal component especially when the proton spectrum has a prominent nonthermal component . and in some cases the electrons are heated to relativistic temperatures . in such a case",
    "the electron bremsstrahlung will exceed the proton ( inverse ) bremsstrahlung .",
    "this is another difficulty with production of hard x - rays by a proton rather than an electron nonthermal tail .    _ in summery , the above results strongly suggest that producing a significant proton nonthermal tail requires a significant fine tuning of the acceleration parameters , the duration of the acceleration , and/or the initial distributions . as a result , for example , maintaining such a spectrum that could produce hard x - rays in the icm over a hubble time would be difficult . _",
    "in this paper , we have explored the possibility of development of nonthermal tails in the spectrum of protons starting from a background ( nonrelativistic ) thermal plasma .",
    "we use a generic phenomenological energizing mechanism with a simple three parameter form for energy diffusion and acceleration rates . as briefly described after eq .",
    "( [ taccel ] ) in  2 , these forms can simulate a broad range of acceleration processes .",
    "the energizing is opposed by coulomb energy losses .",
    "such a process may be in operation in the initial phase of most acceleration mechanisms and may be important in collisional plasmas like in solar and stellar flares and in the icm of galaxy clusters and could produce nonthermal bremsstrahlung radiation in the hard x - ray regime in collisions with the background electrons .",
    "we derived the coulomb energy - loss and diffusion coefficients in a general setting of a  hot plasma \" where the distribution of target particles and the masses of the test and target particles are arbitrary .",
    "we present analytic formulas for maxwellian distribution that asymptotically approach the cold target relations at high energies .",
    "we have generalized the algorithm developed by pe08 to solve the coupled electron - proton kinetic equations .",
    "we show that it satisfies the steady state equilibrium distributions ( appendix a ) , and the energy conservation ( appendix b ) , in appendix c we test our algorithm by demonstrating that in absence of acceleration the particle distributions relax to maxwellian within the expected timescales starting from several non - equilibrium initial conditions . in appendix",
    "d we discuss the inelastic energy loss rates and present a new analytic formula for proton energy loss rate due to pion production .    using the algorithm",
    ", we obtain the time evolution of the proton and electron distributions . because of shorter collision time of electrons",
    "the production of nonthermal electron tails require a higher rate of acceleration and shorter acceleration time than those used here for the protons . _ thus , in our simulations we include only acceleration of protons which may be the case in the presence of low frequency alfvnic turbulence .",
    "the electrons gain energy from protons but thermalize quickly . _",
    "the resulting proton spectra are decomposed into thermal and nonthermal components according to the fitting methods of pe08 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   for @xmath146 ,",
    "even when acceleration time @xmath24 is sufficiently small so that the energizing rate is comparable to or faster than the thermalization rate , an initially maxwellian proton spectrum evolves into a hotter one and broader than thermal distribution with little sign of a distinct nonthermal tail .",
    "this is because for @xmath147 the energizing rate is smaller at higher energies and not efficient in acceleration into a high - energy tail .",
    "this suggests that @xmath23 must be positive for production of a distinct nonthermal tail and a mild temperature increase .",
    "this means we need turbulence with spectrum considerably steeper than kolmogorov .",
    "we show that for @xmath112 the temperature increases more slowly as long as most of the particles have kinetic energy below @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , a significant nonthermal tail may appear if @xmath24 is comparable to or smaller than the proton thermalization time .",
    "for such small values of @xmath24 , however , once a considerable fraction of the protons have reached @xmath25 , they rapidly evolves into a completely nonthermal , runaway distribution .",
    "this will be more pronounced for even higher values of @xmath23 , where acceleration rate increases more rapidly with energy .",
    "3 .   the electron spectrum remains nearly thermal in every case considered in this paper . for cases",
    "where the proton distribution is nearly maxwellian the electron temperature remains somewhat below that of the proton .",
    "but when the proton distribution contains a significant or a larger nonthermal component ( and @xmath148 for most protons ) the electron temperature can reach the average energy of the protons and be much higher than that of the proton thermal component .",
    "_ in summary , the above results shows that a great deal of fine - tuning and a steeper than kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence is necessary for creating a significant nonthermal proton tail without excessive heating of protons and/or electrons even when only protons are energized . _",
    "a corollary of this is that , contrary to some claims ( wolfe & melia 2006 : boldt & serlemitsos 1969 ) , nonthermal inverse bremsstrahlung can not be a significant contributor to hard x - ray emissions ( see also emslie & brown 1985 ) .",

    "major grant no . 4842 .",
    "when two species of particles denoted by @xmath149 and @xmath150 are in thermal equilibrium , the time - independent fp equation ( @xmath151 ) for each of the two of the species , say @xmath149 , is written as @xmath152 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e}[(\\dot{e}^{\\mathrm{hot}}_{ii}(e)+\\dot{e}^{\\mathrm{hot}}_{ij}(e))n_i(e)],\\ ] ] where @xmath153 is the ( maxwellian ) distribution of the species @xmath149 and all the coulomb coefficients are evaluated at the same temperature as that of @xmath153 . since the @xmath153 must be time - independent even in the absence of coulomb interactions with the other species of particles , i.e. , @xmath154 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e}[\\dot{e}^{\\mathrm{hot}}_{ii}(e)n_i(e)],\\ ] ] it follows that , in particular , @xmath155 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e}[\\dot{e}^{\\mathrm{hot}}_{ij}(e)n_i(e)].\\ ] ] given @xmath153 and @xmath156 we can integrate this equation to uniquely determine @xmath157 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient uniquely determined in this way agrees exactly with the ones presented in  2 , which justifies the assumptions used in their derivations .",

    "the normalized log - normal distribution function is given by @xmath185 whose mean is @xmath186 .",
    "note that , for @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and the log - normal distribution becomes essentially a dirac delta function centered at @xmath189 . in this case",

    "within 10 s of @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively , electrons and protons acquire maxwellian distributions ( as can be seen in this figure this is the case at @xmath195 and @xmath196,respectively .",

    "pion production starts at threshold energy @xmath207 mev and dominates all losses ( including coulomb ) above few gev .",
    "proton - electron interactions can produce x- and gamma - rays via ( inverse ) bremsstrahlung process . since energy loss rate is an invariant quantity it follows that @xmath208 will be equal to that of e - p bremsstrahlung in the rest frame of the proton , so that this rate is also given by eq .",
