    "in the proposed india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) , the rpcs @xcite have been chosen as the prime active detector for muon detection in an iron calorimeter ( ical ) , which will be used for studying atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "detailed studies are being performed on glass rpcs for ino @xcite . in this article , we report a parallel effort on building and testing of the rpc modules using the bakelite obtained from the local industries in india .",
    "the aim of the study is to achieve stable performance of such a rpc detector for prolonged operation in streamer mode .",
    "two 300 mm @xmath1 300 mm @xmath1 2 mm bakelite sheets are used as electrodes .",
    "the inner surfaces of the two sheets are separated by a 2 mm gap .",
    "uniform separation of the electrodes are ensured by using five button spacers of 10 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness , and edge spacers of 300 mm @xmath1 8 mm @xmath1 2 mm dimension , both being made of polycarbonate .",
    "two nozzles for gas inlet and outlet , also made of polycarbonate , are placed as part of the edge spacers.the edges of the modules are sealed by applying a layer of the epoxy adhesive to prevent permeation of moisture .",
    "the 2 mm thick active gas gap of the rpc modules are leak - checked using argon and helium sniffer probes .",
    "after cleaning , a graphite coating is made on the outer surfaces of bakelite sheets to form the electrodes .",
    "a gap of 10 mm from the edges to the graphite layer is maintained to avoid external sparking .",
    "the surface resistivity varies from 500 k@xmath2/@xmath3 to 2 m@xmath2/@xmath3 for different electrode surfaces .",
    "the graphite coating , applied by using a spray gun , however , results in a non - uniformity ( less than 20% ) for a particular coated surface . two small ( 20 mm @xmath1 10 mm ) copper foils @xmath4 20 @xmath5 m thick are pasted by kapton tape on both the outer surfaces for the application of high voltage .",
    "the high voltage connectors are soldered on these copper strips .",
    "equal high voltages with opposite polarities are applied on both the surfaces .    in order to collect the accumulated induced charges ,",
    "pick - up strips are placed above the graphite coated surfaces .",
    "the pick - up strips are made of copper ( 20 @xmath5 m thick ) , pasted on one side of 10 mm thick foam .",
    "the area of each strip is 300 mm @xmath1 30 mm with a separation of 2 mm between two adjacent strips .",
    "the pick - up strips are covered with 100 @xmath5 m thick kapton foils to insulate them from the graphite layers .",
    "the ground plane , made of aluminium , is pasted on the other side of the foam .",
    "the signals from different strips are sent through a ribbon cable , followed by rg-174/u coaxial cables using proper impedance matching .",
    "the bakelite sheets are phenolic resin bonded paper laminates . in the present work ,",
    "two types of bakelite sheets have been used to build several detector modules .",
    "they are ( a ) superhylam and ( b ) p-120 .",
    "the p-120 grade bakelite is manufactured by bakelite hylam , india and the superhylam grade is obtained from the other manufacturer super hylam , india .",
    "the surfaces of p-120 are matt finished whereas superhylam is glossy finished .",
    "specifications are given in table 1 .",
    "the bulk resistivity of the electrode plates of the rpc is an important parameter @xcite .",
    "the high resistivity helps in controlling the time resolution , counting rate and also prevents the discharge from spreading through the whole gas @xcite .",
    "we have measured the bulk resistivities of the bakelite sheets via the measurement of the leakage current .    the bulk resistivity ( @xmath6 ) as a function of the applied voltage for the two grades of bakelites.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "schematic representation of the cosmic ray test setup.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    fig .",
    "2 shows the schematic of the setup for testing the rpc modules using cosmic rays .",
    "three scintillators , two placed above the rpc plane and one placed below are used for obtaining the trigger from the incidence of the cosmic rays .",
    "the coincidence between scintillator i ( 350 mm @xmath1 250 mm size ) , scintillator ii ( 350 mm @xmath1 250 mm size ) and the finger scintillator(iii ) ( 200 mm @xmath1 40 mm size ) is taken as the master trigger . finally , the ored signal obtained from two adjacent pick - up strips of the chamber is put in coincidence with the master trigger obtained above .",
    "this is referred to as the coincidence trigger of the rpc .",
    "the window of the cosmic ray telescope is of area 200 mm @xmath1 40 mm .",
    "the width of the finger scintillator is made smaller than the total width of the two adjacent readout strips .",
    "a correction has been applied for dead zones ( of area 200 mm @xmath1 2 mm ) in between two adjacent readout strips .",
    "the high voltages to the rpc are applied at the ramping rate of 5 v / s on both the electrodes .",
    "the streamer pulses are obtained starting from the high voltage of 5 kv across the rpc .",
    "the leakage current as measured by the high voltage system is recorded for further study .",
    "the leading edge discriminators are used for the scintillators and the rpc pulses .",
    "various thresholds are used on the discriminators to reduce the noise . for our final results ,",
    "a threshold of 40 mv is used on the rpc signal .",
    "we have used a camac - based data acquisition system .",
    "counts accumulated in a scalar over a fixed time period are recorded at regular intervals , and saved in a periodic log database .",
    "the temperature and the humidity are monitored at the time of measurement .",
    "the gases used in the rpc are mixtures of argon , isobutane and tetrafluroethane ( r-134a ) in 34:7:59 mixing ratio .",
    "the gases are pre - mixed , stored in a stainless steel container and sent to the detector using stainless steel tubes . a typical flow rate of 0.4 ml per minute resulting in @xmath4 3 changes of gap volume per day is maintained by the gas delivery system .",
    "variation of less than 4% is found in the mixing ratio for argon , isobutane and r-134a respectively in a systematic analysis by a residual gas analyzer .",
    "an important and obvious goal of any rpc detector development is to study the long term stability with high efficiency . in that spirit , the following studies are performed in the cosmic ray test bench of the rpc detectors .",
    "the efficiency of the rpc detector , taken as the ratio between the coincidence trigger rates of the rpc and the master trigger rates of the 3-element plastic scintillator telescope as mentioned in sec.4 , is studied by varying the applied high voltage ( hv ) for each detector .",
    "the rates are calculated from data taken over 30 minutes duration for each hv setting .",
    "the temperature and humidity during these measurements are recorded to be about 22 - 25@xmath7c and 63 - 65% respectively .",
    "the average master trigger rate is @xmath8 0.005 hz/@xmath9 .",
    "the variation of efficiency with applied hv is shown in the fig .",
    "3(a ) and that of the counting rates with the hv is shown in the fig .",
    "it is seen that for both the bakelite grades , the efficiency has increased from 20% to 75% as hv is ramped up from 6.5 kv to 6.8 kv .",
    "the efficiency for the sh rpc gradually increases and reaches the plateau at @xmath4 96% from 7.5 kv , while that of the ib1 rpc reaches a maximum of @xmath4 79% at 7.2 kv and then decreases steadily up to @xmath4 35% as the hv is increased to 9 kv . the counting rates in both the cases , however , have increased more or less exponentially with sudden jumps around 6.5 - 7.0 kv ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , i.e. near the points where the efficiency becomes uniform ( in case of sh ) or starts to decrease ( in case of ib1 ) .",
    "this possibly indicates the onset of a breakdown regime that recovers in a reasonable time for the sh but works the other way for the ib1 .",
    "similar behavior is observed also for ib2 and ib3 . ib2 and ib3 are made to study the consistency of the results .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the counting rate and the leakage current of the sh are both larger than those of the ib1 , ib2 @xmath10 ib3 , which are expected on the basis of smaller bulk resistivity of the superhylam grade bakelite @xcite .",
    "( a ) the efficiency as a function of high voltage for rpcs [ three rpc made with p-120 grade bakelite ( with & without silicone coating ) and one made with superhylam grade bakelite ] obtained with a gas mixture of argon ( 34% ) + isobutane ( 7% ) + r-134a ( 59% ) .",
    "the thresholds are set at 40 mv for ib1 , ib2 & ib3 and 50 mv for sh .",
    "( b ) counting rate as a function of high voltage .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    in order to investigate the reason for the phenomena of reduction of efficiency in the ib1 above @xmath4 7.2 kv , and taking cue from the fact that superhylam surfaces are glossy finished while the p-120 surfaces are matt finished , we have dismantled the detectors and made surface profile scan over a 5 mm span of the surfaces using dektak 117 profilometer .",
    "these scans are shown in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that both the surfaces have a short range variation ( typically @xmath4 0.1 @xmath5 m length scale ) and a long range variation ( typically @xmath4 1 @xmath5 m length scale ) .",
    "the long range surface fluctuation , which is a measure of non - uniformity , averaged over several scans are : 0.84 @xmath11 0.12 @xmath5 m ( p-120 ) and 0.49 @xmath11 0.17 @xmath5 m ( superhylam ) .",
    "thus the long range fluctuations , within the limits of experimental uncertainties , are nearly the same .",
    "on the other hand the short range fluctuations , a measure of surface roughness , are : 0.64 @xmath11 0.06 @xmath5 m ( p-120 ) and 0.17 @xmath11 0.02 @xmath5 m ( superhylam ) , and thus indicate a superior surface quality of the superhylam grade .",
    "linear surface profile scans of the two grades of bakelite sheets.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    to explore a remedial measure for the ib1 rpc , we have applied a thin layer of viscous silicone fluid ( chemical formula : [ r@xmath12sio]@xmath13 , where r = organic groups such as methyl , ethyl , or phenyl ) [ coefficient of viscosity = 5.5 pa.s at 23@xmath7c , manufactured by metroark limited , kolkata , india ] on the inner surfaces of the p-120 bakelite sheets . about 1 g of the fluid is applied over 300 mm @xmath1 300 mm area . based on the specific gravity ( 1.02 at 23@xmath7c ) of the fluid",
    ", the estimated coating thickness would be @xmath4 10 @xmath5 m .",
    "this material is chosen for the following reasons : a ) very low chemical reactivity with the gases used ; b ) good thermal stability over a wide temperature range ( from -100 to 250 @xmath7c ) ; c ) very good electrical insulator ; d ) excellent adhesion to most of the solid materials , and e ) low vapour pressure , which is essential for stable operation over a reasonable time period .",
    "the silicone treated surfaces are kept under infrared lamp for 2 hours to allow the viscous fluid to fill all the micro - crevices on the surface .",
    "the reassembled detector is tested at the same set - up .",
    "the results of efficiency and count rate measurements , shown in the figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , indicate a remarkable improvement in the performance of the p-120 detector .",
    "the efficiency increases from 20% to 75% as the hv is increased from 5.7 kv to 6.2 kv , while the singles count rate , as a whole has decreased by a factor of 5 .",
    "this indicates quenching of micro - discharge after silicone treatment , which is very much desirable for functioning of the detector .",
    "the efficiency in this case reaches @xmath0 95% plateau at 7 kv .",
    "improvement on performances is also observed for the ib2 and ib3 after the application of silicone fluid on the inner surfaces as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "it is worth noting that surface treatment with insulating / non - polar liquid as a remedial measure was first demonstrated for the babar rpcs .",
    "however , it was observed that formation of stalagmites by polymerisation of uncured linseed oil droplets had created conducting paths through the gap , thereby causing irreversible damage to the bakelite plates @xcite .",
    "the process of linseed oil treatment was later changed by increasing the proportion of eptane as a solvent to produce a thinner coating ( 10 - 30 @xmath5 m ) on the inner surface @xcite . our observation that silicone coating of the inner surfaces aides the proper functioning of our p-120 bakelite rpc detector once again confirms the importance of smooth surface finish of the inner surfaces .    to judge the improvement in the overall performance of the rpc detector , we have measured the leakage current through the rpc detector with and without silicone coating and the plot of these as a function of the applied hv",
    "is shown in the fig .",
    "both the plots show a common feature that the current - voltage curves have two distinctly different slopes as it has been shown earlier @xcite .",
    "while the gas gap behaves as an insulator in the lower range of applied voltage and hence the slope over this span scales as the conductance of the polycarbonate spacers , at higher range of voltage , the gas behaves as a conducting medium due to the formation of the streamers .",
    "therefore , the slope over this range scales as the conductance of the gas gap .",
    "it is seen that the slope in the higher range of voltage is much steeper for the rpc without silicone coating and hence it points to the fact that some sort of uncontrolled streamers are being formed in the gas gap causing a degradation of the efficiency @xcite .",
    "this possibly does not happen in the rpc detectors with silicone coating .",
    "current as a function of the applied voltage for rpc made by p-120 grade bakelite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the long term stability of the bakelite rpcs has been studied using the same cosmic ray test set - up .",
    "the coincidence trigger counts of the rpcs and the master trigger counts , accumulated over every 2 hours , have been recorded continuously for more than 4 months at a hv of 8 kv .",
    "the average room temperature and the relative humidity have been recorded to be 22 - 25@xmath7c and 63 - 65% , respectively .",
    "the count rates of the rpcs have also been recorded simultaneously .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) depict the variation of efficiency and count rates over the above mentioned period for both the grades of rpcs .",
    "the sh rpc had worked with an efficiency of @xmath0 95% which remained steady for 25 days , but beyond that , it deteriorated gradually to @xmath4 86% efficiency within next 13 days .",
    "the count rate , however , had increased from 1 hz/@xmath9 to 10 hz/@xmath9 within 10 days , and then it increased slowly over the next 28 days .",
    "after that period , the count rate shot up to @xmath0 30 hz/@xmath9 .",
    "the leakage current gradually increased from 3 - 4 @xmath5a to @xmath0 10 @xmath5a within that period .",
    "the test on this rpc was discontinued after 38 days and the silicone coated ib1 rpc was mounted .",
    "the efficiency measured was @xmath4 96% and above and has remained steady for more than 130 days .",
    "the count rate also has remained steady around 0.1 hz/@xmath9 .",
    "the leakage current was found to be marginally dependent on temperature and humidity , though it has remained steady at @xmath4 400 na during the operation .",
    "( a ) efficiency as a function of period of operation for two rpc prototypes .",
    "operating voltage is 8 kv for both the rpc .",
    "( b ) the counting rate as a function of period of operation for the two rpc prototypes.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the sh rpc has also been tested again after a gap of a few months .",
    "it has shown the same higher leakage current ( @xmath0 10 @xmath5a ) and lower efficiency ( @xmath4 86% ) indicating that some intrinsic breakdown of the bulk material may have taken place .",
    "in conclusion , a comparative study of bakelite rpcs made from two different grades of bakelites commercially available in india is performed .",
    "the rpc , made of superhylam grade bakelite with glossy finished surface is found to have a shorter life . on the other hand ,",
    "the rpcs made from p-120 grade bakelite with matt finished surfaces , which are coated with a thin layer of viscous silicone fluid , are found to work steadily for more than 130 days showing a constant efficiency of @xmath0 96% without any degradation .",
    "the detector is found to be less immune to variation in humidity which makes it a viable alternative to semiconductive glass based rpc for use in the ical detector of the ino .",
    "application of silicone fluid on the surface shows improved performance , suggesting the making of a smoother surface . as a future plan",
    ", we will perform in detail the study of the properties of the surfaces after silicone coating .",
    "a detailed analysis will be performed on the exhaust gas to understand the effect of silicone , if any .",
