    "it was shown in a later work @xcite that this correction is essentially equivalent to the high density correction obtained on the lines of enskog correction to dense gases , therefore it has been omitted in the present consideration of dilute bed .    due to the anisotropic nature of the energy input to the vibro - fluidised bed , the lower order moments of the distribution clearly show the anisotropy . figs .",

    "anisotropies were also observed by us in deep bed simulations of disks which had the wave - like surface patterns @xcite ; although the nature of anisotropy was more pronounced even in the shape of the distribution function itself ( the vertical distribution had double peaks and the horizontal distribution had single peak and exponential tails ) .",
    "could the presence of anisotropy be an important feature giving rise to an instability in one direction ?",
    "a stability analysis of the solution from the present analysis model might help resolve this .",
    "the usual models based on hydrodynamic equations do not take into account this anisotropy .          as pointed out earlier ,",

    "[ fig : uz3d ] even when the density prediction is not expected to be good .        to conclude",

    "( b ) the qualitative nature of results obtained here are similar to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "( c ) the correction to the distribution function due to spatial variation of the order of a particle diameter was neglected here as this is turns out to be a a correction to a higher order in density @xcite . with this",
    "it is seen that the density still shows a negative correction at the bottom wall due to the energy flow .",
    "( d ) the boundary conditions are overspecified in the problem and we chose to satisfy exactly , only the ones involved in the momentum transfer the vertical direction .",
    "( e ) even with this restricted choice , the theoretical values for the different moments compare reasonably well with the simulation particularly in the anisotropy exhibited .",
    "( f ) this gives us some confidence to explore further with the stability of the solution , and with an higher order approximation to the distribution function if required ."
