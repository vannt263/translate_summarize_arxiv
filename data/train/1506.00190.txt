    "since each stitch position of a sewing machine can be moved to its eight neighbor positions ( left , right , up , down , up - left , up - right , down - left , and down - right ) , one set of adjacent lattices forms a supergrid graph which may be disconnected .",
    "note that each lattice will be represented by a vertex of a supergrid graph , each region may be separated by many blocks in which each block represented a connected supergrid graph .",
    "the desired sewing trace of each set of adjacent lattices is the hamiltonian cycle ( path ) of the corresponding connected supergrid graph when it is hamiltonian .",

    "in addition , the structure of supergrid graphs can be used to design the topology of networks , and the network diameter of the proposed supergrid graphs is smaller than that of grid graphs .        in this paper , we will study the hamiltonian property of a subclass of supergrid graphs , called _ linear - convex supergrid graphs_. a supergrid graph @xmath1 is _ linearly convex _ if , for every line @xmath28 which contains an edge of @xmath25 , the intersection of @xmath28 and @xmath1 is either a line segment ( a path in @xmath1 ) , or a point ( a vertex in @xmath1 ) , or empty .",
