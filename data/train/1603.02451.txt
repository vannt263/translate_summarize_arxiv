    "it is gratifying that to within 5% the calculations reproduce the absolute scale of the experimental results .",

    "[ fig : lifixed ] shows similar results for calculations based on the full variable energy of eq.([eq : sqrts ] ) and it is evident that the energy dependence is reproduced very well by calculations .",
    "the value of @xmath18 ( eq.([eq : sqrts ] ) ) was adjusted to the low density of @xmath2li .",
    "adding also the pauli correlations made very small difference .",
    "it is therefore seen that ( i ) from the energy - dependence of the ratios the prescription of eq.([eq : sqrts ] ) is supported by experiment and ( ii ) effects due to pauli correlations are very small for the low - density @xmath2li nucleus .    turning to the other target nuclei , namely c , si and ca , calculations with fixed energies ( not shown ) display systematic deficiencies regarding the variation with energy of the experimental to calculated ratios , similarly to the results for @xmath2li .",
    "figure  [ fig : nucvar ] ( top ) shows the ratios obtained using the @xmath35 algorithm eq.([eq : sqrts ] ) but without the pauli correlations corrections of wrw .",
    "the energy dependence of the ratios for the reaction cross sections is seen to be well reproduced by the calculations but there is a residual disagreement in the energy dependence for the total cross sections , notably for c. the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig : nucvar ] shows these ratios where the wrw in - medium corrections have also been included , and the improved agreement is evident .",
    "the larger scatter of the ratios for si has been observed also in earlier analyses @xcite .",
    "agreement to 2 - 3% between calculation and experiment for the reaction and total cross sections on the very low density @xmath2li , as obtained above , had not been observed in earlier analyses .",
    "consequently we deal here directly with the cross sections for the ` normal ' targets of c , si and ca , without the use of ` super - ratios ' , namely , without normalizing experimental to calculated ratios for a given target to the corresponding ratios for @xmath2li . moreover , with the present model for variations of the in - medium energies we try to fit calculations to experiment for the three targets at the four energies put together , a total of 24 data points .",
    "the first phenomenological approach is to simply multiply separately the real and the imaginary parts of the amplitudes by a respective scaling factor , the same for all energies and four targets .",
    "obviously no fit to the data is possible with @xmath2li included because for @xmath2li no scaling factors are expected whereas this is not the case for c , si and ca . removing @xmath2li from the data , fits of two parameters to the three heavier targets yields for 24 data points @xmath53=23.8 when using assigned errors of @xmath543.7% as implied by the scatter of the ratios of calculated to experimental cross sections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nucvar ] ) .",
    "the scaling factors are then @xmath55=0.87@xmath540.10 for the real part and @xmath56=1.41@xmath540.02 for the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "a separate fit to the eight @xmath2li cross sections leads to @xmath53=8.7 with scaling factors of 0.71@xmath540.10 and 1.02@xmath540.02 for the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "reducing the assigned errors all the way down to the statistical errors does not change the resulting scaling factors .",
    "consequently we conclude that the real part of the amplitudes needs rescaling by 0.9@xmath540.1 whereas the imaginary part needs rescaling by 1.40@xmath540.02 in order to fit the reaction and total cross sections on c , si and ca .",
    "alternatives to rescaling of the input amplitudes have been tried too by adding a phenomenological term to the potential in order to fit the c , si and ca cross sections .",
    "fits were possible by adding a term with higher powers of density than linear , to simulate two - nucleon processes .",
    "another version was to add a linear term as a @xmath4-wave potential of the kisslinger type @xcite .",
    "both options could close the 23% gap between the calculated cross sections based on the input amplitudes and experiment .",
    "however , comparisons with the few available results on the elastic scattering of @xmath0 by c did not support such approaches .     by c. experimental results",

    "[ fig : angdist ] the dashed curve shows the predictions made using the present model with in - medium kinematics and wrw pauli correlations effects .",
    "the solid curve shows the results when the above rescaling factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 are applied to the real and imaginary parts , respectively , to fit the ( enhanced ) reaction and total cross sections .",
    "both are in fair agreement with experiment , showing very little sensitivity of the angular distribution to modifications required to fit the reaction and total cross sections .",
    "the option of adding a phenomenological non - linear term or a linear @xmath4-wave term to the potential ( not shown ) , produced angular distributions that disagree sharply with experiment beyond the first minimum .",
    "another attempt was to use for the in - medium forward scattering amplitudes only the @xmath41-wave amplitudes from said @xcite , thus neglecting the contributions from the @xmath4- and @xmath37-wave terms , and to add an explicit phenomenological @xmath4-wave potential @xcite . that too made it possible to fit the reaction and total cross section with only two parameters . in this case",
    "the balance between repulsive and attractive real parts of the potential changed and the predicted angular distribution , dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdist ] , is acceptable .",
    "very similar results were obtained with @xmath0 elastically scattered by c at 635 mev / c @xcite .",
    "we have also checked if it was possible to include @xmath2li in the data and to fit all 32 cross sections with additional terms in the potential .",
    "this approach failed before @xcite and it has likewise failed in the present work . however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a possible way to handle @xmath2li and the other targets together was by using as a parameter an _ average _ density of the nucleus that turns out to cut - off @xmath2li from the rescaling of the imaginary potential . in this model",

    "the predicted angular distribution for elastic scattering of 715  mev / c k@xmath61 by c when using this prescription is indistinguishable from the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : angdist ] .",
    "recent in - medium algorithm for calculating optical potentials from the respective meson - nucleon forward scattering amplitudes , used so far for kaonic atoms , pionic atoms , low energy pion scattering and @xmath39-nucleus interactions , was used in the present work to calculate integral cross sections for low energy @xmath0 mesons .",
    "this work was motivated by better penetrability of kaons into nuclei below 800  mev / c in comparison with other particles thus providing more sensitive tests of this approach .",
    "in particular , penetration beyond the nuclear surface into where the density is close to the full nuclear density means shifts of up to 30  mev in the argument of the in - medium amplitude which causes observable effects .",
    "it was possible to test separately the effects of the energy - dependence implied by the model and the importance of applying corrections due to pauli correlations .",
    "both were found to improve the agreement between experiment and calculations regarding the energy - dependence of total and reaction cross sections of @xmath0 on c , si and ca , particularly at the lower energy end of the range .    for the low - density @xmath2li nucleus , calculation and experiment",
    "agree to better than 3% uniformly over the energy range studied when the variable energy of the model is applied .",
    "effects due to pauli correlations are negligibly small .",
    "compared with earlier analysis @xcite the full agreement achieved for @xmath2li is partly due to the inclusion in the present work of @xmath37-wave contributions to the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the @xmath62 partial wave contributes attraction that is close to 30% of the repulsion due to the @xmath63 partial wave , particularly at the lower energies .",
    "the @xmath2li provides a solid basis for direct comparisons with the other three nuclear targets without a need to use so - called ` super - ratios ' , namely , normalizing experimental to calculated ratios for a target to the corresponding ratios for @xmath2li .",
    "the experimental cross sections for c , si and ca are found to be ( 23@xmath544)% larger than calculation , in general agreement with previous observations .",
    "this enhancement could be reproduced phenomenologically by rescaling the imaginary part of the potential by 40@xmath542% but quantitative understanding of this effect could not be achieved .",
    "it suggests that in - medium enhancements of @xmath0-nucleon interaction are due to more exotic mechanisms than traditional corrections .",
