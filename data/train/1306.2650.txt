    "the capability to control and manipulate the interatomic interactions as well as the confinement potential where they move , have made ultracold atomic gases excellent and clean experimental systems where predictions and phenomena belonging to the field of condensed matter can and have been reenacted @xcite .",
    "this has yielded the opportunity to probe into questions that may not be possible to do directly in the latter systems . in this",
    "regard , large ensembles of bosonic atoms confined in optical lattices have been thought as promising candidates in the realization of controllable macroscopic coherent states to pursue quantum computing objectives .",
    "this is so because , since the first realization of an optical lattice , signatures of macroscopic coherence were observed @xcite .",
    "most of the phenomena alluded above are based on the existence of macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "the opposite , decoherence , is a process in which the phase coherence or phase interference is destroyed . due to unavoidable presence of interatomic interactions ,",
    "even when they can be externally handled and thus diminished , there exists a characteristic time where coherence diminishes @xcite . since typical measurements carried out in optical lattices",
    "are related with oscillations in particle population across lattice wells , these systems can be thought as suitable devices to be used as time coherence tracers . in particular , bose gases confined in arrays of few wells",
    "may be considered as ideal realizations to pursue such aims .",
    "a condensate confined in a double - well potential , the so called bosonic josephson junction@xcite , represents the simplest system where decoherence can be investigated @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of optical lattices have been accomplished within mean field ( mf ) and bose - hubbard ( bh ) schemes@xcite . as it is well known",
    "both descriptions predict the opposite regimes of josephson oscillations ( jo ) and self - trapping ( st ) as a function of the ratio between inter - particle interactions and hopping strengths . however , the most relevant discrepancy among them is that , while the transport of particles across the lattice in mf approximation shows always coherent oscillations , except for exceptional values of the initial conditions associated to fixed points , in bh description , typically , the dynamics shows collapses to quasi - stationary states with revivals in the particle population .",
    "these collapses are caused by the unavoidable presence of the inter - particle interactions , and are observed in actual experiments @xcite . even though interatomic interactions can be externally changed by means of feshbach resonances , it is almost impossible to completely neutralize them .",
    "it is this behavior of collapses and revivals one of our main interests here .",
    "that is , we will show , as pointed earlier @xcite , that as the number of particles @xmath0 is increased , for fixed interactions , the time spent in the revivals becomes much smaller than the time spent in the collapsed intervals , in such a way that mostly the system is at a states that become effectively stationary .",
    "we call these states statistically stationary and the decay to those states as  intrinsic \" decoherence .    in this work we focus in the study of these aspects for bosons confined in triple wells potentials in 1d ( twp1d ) within the bose - hubbard approach .",
    "the dynamics and stationary properties of condensates in twp1d have been widely investigated within the mean field or gross - pitaevskii approach ; the latter studies encompassing transport characterization of chaos @xcite , irreversible transport between wells @xcite , dynamics of collective excitations @xcite and tunneling inhibition as prospects for transistor - like quantum engineering @xcite among others . in the context of bh or full quantum description we can mention the analysis of stationary states and tunneling dynamics for few ( @xmath1 ) @xcite and large ( @xmath2 ) ensembles of bosons @xcite .    as stated , the main interest of this manuscript is to characterize the processes of intrinsic decoherence and loss of purity in a bose condensate confined in a tw1d .",
    "we emphasize that this decoherence is termed  intrinsic \" to distinguish it from the relaxation process that takes place when a quantum mechanical system weakly interacts with its environment .",
    "however , from another perspective , the difference may not be as strong as it may appear , since the environment in this case may be represented by the @xmath0-particle states while the  system \" is associated with few - body properties .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , intrinsic decoherence can be addressed from two different approaches . by means of modifications to the unitary evolution of schrdinger evolution or by strict quantum mechanical procedure plus statistical mechanical arguments . here",
    ", we adopt the second one , to study the entitled intrinsic decoherence in an interacting bose - einstein condensate in a symmetric triple well potential in 1d .",
    "as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , a synonymous of intrinsic decoherence is the observation of stationary states ; that may or may not be thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "such stationary states are characterized by having their few - body properties no longer evolving in time .",
    "the attainment of such a stationary state can be monitored by following the evolution in time of the matrix elements of the few - body reduced density matrix @xmath3 which , once in the stationary state , those matrix elements become constant .",
    "such a constancy in time has been identified as a signature of decoherence since it is always possible to find a proper basis , the so - called _ preferred basis _",
    "@xcite , in which the off - diagonal matrix elements of the reduced density matrix become zero .",
    "another quantity recorded from the dynamics within the full quantum scheme , that allows to exhibit the influence of inter - particle interactions in a closed isolated system , is the purity @xmath4 of the state .",
    "this quantity defined as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the density matrix of the state @xcite , measures the degree of decoherence or mixing in a system .",
    "a totally coherent state has @xmath7 indicating that the system state can be specified by a vector state @xmath8 such that @xmath9 . as it is known , the specification of such a state requires to perform a complete set of measurements consistent with the system degrees of freedom .",
    "in analogy to the intrinsic decoherence detected from @xmath3 , here we shall consider the purity of one - body states .",
    "namely , in this work we study the evolution in time of the one - body reduced density matrix , and the purity @xmath4 , to demonstrate how an interacting @xmath0-particle system described through a bose - hubbard hamiltonian exhibits both intrinsic decoherence and loss of purity .",
    "this paper is organized in four sections . in section",
    "ii we present the model that describes the system , namely the bh hamiltonian , and summarize in a phase diagram all the stationary states as a function of the number of particles and interaction strength . in section iii",
    "we concentrate in studying certain aspects of the full quantum dynamics that emerge as the system size is increased , namely the intrinsic decoherence and the purity . by using relevant sets of @xmath0-particle systems",
    "we illustrate in this section the existence of a stationary state and the purity in body properties .",
    "our calculations are performed for @xmath10 and 150 .",
    "to quantify the deviations from the stationary mean value as a function of @xmath0 we use the frobenius norm .",
    "finally , in section iv a summary of our findings is presented .",
    "the system under study consists of a bose quantum fluid confined in a symmetric triple well potential in 1d ( tw1d ) .",
    "as stated in section i , stationary and dynamical properties of this system has been extensively studied in the literature within bh and mf schemes @xcite . in this section",
    "we revisit the analysis of the stationary states for the tw1d .",
    "the aim of such a study is to compare the stationary states of bh model obtained from direct diagonalization , with those predicted from the @xmath0-body dynamical evolution .",
    "the study of stationary states from dynamical evolution will be performed through the analysis of decoherence and loss of purity .    within the full quantum @xmath11body scenario , except for constant factors that scale with the number of particles , the hamiltonian that describes the system in the one level - picture , that is , considering the three lowest single particle states and its corresponding wannier functions , is the bh model @xcite    @xmath12    where the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 create and annihilate particles in the site @xmath15 and satisfy the usual commutation rules for bosons @xmath16= \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath17 written in terms of the @xmath18-wave scattering length @xmath19 , @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the atomic mass of the considered specie and @xmath22 the localized wannier functions , scales the contact interactions among pairs of particles . for a given number of particles @xmath0 , the size of the hilbert space is @xmath23 and therefore , the size of hamiltonian , given by eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) , scales as @xmath24 .",
    "the information of the energies of the hamiltonian stationary states can be encoded in a phase diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath25 that measures the ratio among the interaction @xmath17 and the tunneling amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "is related with the inverse of the oscillation period @xmath27 of a single particle in the symmetric triple well potential as @xmath28 . for our numerical calculations",
    "we assume @xmath29 in dimensionless units . in an experiment",
    "this can be done by adjusting the depth of the optical potential , that is , the laser intensity . ] for our calculations we consider @xmath30 .",
    "for which we can perform calculations in a reasonable time is @xmath31 but taking @xmath32 leads quantitatively to the same features than @xmath33 . for practical reasons we restrict ourselves to consider @xmath32 for dynamical calculations . ]",
    "early@xcite and recent@xcite works report calculations for @xmath34 for symmetric arrays of trimers in open and closed configurations .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we plot the exact energy eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) as a function of @xmath35 , for @xmath36 and @xmath32 , and for values of @xmath35 ranging from @xmath37 , in steps of @xmath38 .",
    "all the eigenvalues associated with the ground state lie on a straight line with constant slope , while the highest eigenvalues lie on a curve that changes its slope at @xmath39 . as it is known @xcite , such sets of minimum and maximum eigenenergies correspond to states in which particles oscillate coherently or remain trapped respectively , the so called jo and st regimes .",
    "since this transition has been studied and characterized in the bh context for the tw1d , here we just want to emphasize the dependence ( dense or sparse ) of the energy spectrum on @xmath0 .",
    "we shall name these energy eigenstates as the truly stationary since their evolution remains unchanged by the full unitary propagator @xmath40 $ ] .        regarding the mf scenario ,",
    "it is well known that even though its intrinsic nonintegrability , a bec confined in a triple well potential represents the simplest nonintegrable system that admits , an exhaustive numerical description . for comparison purposes with their bh counterpart ,",
    "we determine the stationary states ( see fig.[figa ] ) .",
    "the straightforward procedure to obtain those stationary states is summarized in the appendix .",
    "in the previous section we determined the stationary eigenstates of the symmetric triple well potential in the bh scheme .",
    "we now turn our attention to the study of certain dynamical aspects of one - body properties with the interest of exhibiting phenomena that appears only within the @xmath0-particle full - quantum description .",
    "first , we shall concentrate in describing the so - called phenomenon of intrinsic decoherence and then we analyze the loss of purity in the closed @xmath0-particle system .",
    "these phenomena can emerge within the full quantum scheme only and its manifestation becomes more evident as the number of particles is increased .",
    "the phenomenon of intrinsic decoherence becomes evident in large @xmath0-body closed systems when they are evolved in time and a statistically stationary state is observed .",
    "such a state can be registered only through the behavior of few body properties , when they exhibit an oscillatory behavior that decays to a constant value that no longer changes during a period of time large enough compared with a characteristic system time scale .",
    "then , after remaining with that constant value during a time interval , the dynamics show again an oscillatory behavior for another time interval , before decaying to the same constant value . the elapsed time to reach such a constant value and the time during which the value of the property under study remains constant",
    "are called the relaxation @xmath41 and the recurrence @xmath42 times respectively . in general , the values of both @xmath41 and @xmath42 depends strongly on the system size and on the initial state from which the system is evolved .",
    "ultracold bosons confined in optical lattices are ideal systems where these assertions , for macroscopic conglomerates , can be reproduced .",
    "the occurrence of a state very close to the initial one , starting from any arbitrary initial condition , is guaranteed because of the fact that within the bh model the hilbert space has a finite size . for @xmath0 particles confined in a 1d lattice composed of @xmath43 wells it scales as @xmath44 , as consequence of considering that the hamiltonian that describes the system takes into account the single particle - modes of the first band only .",
    "it is worth to mention that as the number of wells @xmath43 and particles @xmath0 is increased , the numerical analysis becomes impracticable .",
    "regarding the dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 on the system size , it has been shown for arrays of two wells ( using a particular initial condition ) , that those times scale in such a way that in the limit of large @xmath0 , @xmath45 , thus showing the existence of a stationary state , that we label as  statistical \" to differentiate it from the stationary eigenstates .",
    "here , we concentrate into characterize the phenomenon of intrinsic decoherence for the tw1d by studying the evolution in time of one body properties .",
    "in particular , we shall show that for every initial condition the evolution in time of those properties exhibit on average constant values that no longer evolve in time .",
    "we shall also analyze the dependence of the deviations around the mean stationary value on the system size .",
    "the attainment of a state in which the few body properties no longer change , within the fluctuations around a mean value , identifies the statistically stationary states .",
    "the way in which is possible to detect such states is by following the evolution in time of the expectation value of few body properties for arbitrary initial states .",
    "it is not necessary to argue that if the initial state is chosen to be an @xmath0-particle energy eigenstate , the unitary evolution will leave it invariant , and thus any few body property will neither evolve from its initial value . the expectation value of any few - body property can be determined from either the @xmath0-body density matrix or the few - body reduced density matrix @xmath3 . as mentioned in the previous paragraph , here",
    "we concentrate in the analysis of one particle properties only .",
    "let @xmath46 be an one body operator of the @xmath0-particle system .",
    "that is @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents a single particle operator .",
    "the expectation value of such an operator is given by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 , being the single particle states represented by @xmath51 with @xmath52 in the present problem .",
    "written in terms of the one body reduced density matrix , @xmath53 the expectation value of @xmath46 is @xmath54    to demonstrate that any arbitrary one body property attains a stationary state it suffices to show that , for a given initial condition , every element of the one - body reduced density matrix reaches , within fluctuations around a mean stationary value , a constant value .",
    "in addition , to provide one of the signatures that accompanies the manifestation of decoherence , one has to show that in the stationary state the one body reduced density matrix is a diagonal matrix .",
    "that is ,    @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 denote the mean stationary values that reaches the diagonal elements of @xmath3 in a particular basis , the so called preferred basis @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this basis defined in terms of the unitary transformation labeled by the operator @xmath58 can be obtained numerically and depends on the initial condition and on the value of @xmath35 .    the @xmath0-particle density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ o_1 ] ) is given by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial state .",
    "given the eigenstate basis or the number - fock basis , there exist an infinite number of initial states that can be used to analyze the behavior of the one body reduced density matrix @xmath62 .",
    "we did an exhaustive exploration considering as initial states those that constitutes de fock basis and we also considered the su(3 ) coherent states @xcite .",
    "our analysis was performed for values of @xmath35 below and above the transition from jo to sf regimes .",
    "we illustrate the generality of our findings by showing first the evolution in time of @xmath62 for _ i _ ) initial su(3 ) and then , we show the results for _ ii _ ) an initial state constructed as a superposition of the number - fock states .",

    "the special feature that the su(3 ) states have is that the quantum expectation value of any operator , and in particular the number operator , can be related to the solutions of the mf coupled equations @xcite .",
    "for this reason if @xmath65 numbers are chosen to be the stationary solutions of the hamilton equations for a given value of @xmath35 ( the fixed points ) , then the system will remain in a stationary state under the action of time evolution operator @xmath69 .    here and",

    "one can appreciate in a qualitative way that , as the number of particles is increased , the deviations from the mean stationary values become smaller as the number of particles is increased . to provide a quantitative estimation of the deviation from the mean stationary value of the elements @xmath83 as a function of @xmath0",

    "the information provided by the purity is complementary to the information obtained from @xmath87 .",

    "to perform such an analysis we considered the evolution in time of one - body properties in the @xmath11particle environment . from the time behavior of the one - body reduced density matrix we reached the conclusion that within fluctuations around a mean constant value , stationarity is always observed in every closed bh - like . to determine the role of the system size in the observation of an stationary state we quantified the deviations from the mean stationary value in terms of a matrix norm , the frobenius norm .",
    "we studied the evolution of the one - body reduced density matrix to trace for signatures of decoherence , namely , we show that it is always possible to follow the evolution in a particular basis where the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix become , within the fluctuations , zero in the stationary state . regarding the purity we also considered the one - body reduced density matrix to show the influence of the particle - particle interactions in transforming an initial pure state into a mixed one .",
    "we demonstrated that this conclusion remains valid for hamiltonians with bose - hubbard - like structure .",
    "our numerical calculations for @xmath10 and 150 allowed us to verify that the onset of stationarity is also consequence of dealing with a many body description and not an effective result driven by a non - linearity as the transition among jo and st in the mf approach .    according to the fundamental hypothesis of statistical physics , the existence of a stationary state",
    "is based on the observation that every isolated many - body system , whose energy is sharply defined , and that is left unperturbed , attains a state that no longer evolves in time , the equilibrium state .",
    "this state is detected when few - body physical quantities are measured , as for example , density , temperature , pressure , energy and compressibilities among others .",
    "we believe that the statistically stationary states studied here are analogs of equilibrium states .",
    "we do such an analogy since the bose atoms confined in the triple well potential ( and in general an optical lattice ) constitute a closed system in which the dynamics of arbitrary initial states is dictated by the evolution operator @xmath125 , that leads the system towards a stationary state .",
    "it thus appears that intrinsic decoherence is a synonymous of relaxation towards an equilibrium state in a closed system , and that the typical observation of equilibrium thermodynamic states in closed systems , are a consequence of intrinsic decoherence .",

    "a.c.g acknowledges support from conacyt .    [ [ section ] ]    let us to start by considering the gross - pitaevskii equation for the macroscopic wave function @xmath126 , which in the case of a triple well potential represented by @xmath127 , adopts the form @xmath128\\psi(x , t)\\\\+g|\\psi(x , t)|^2 \\psi(x , t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the approximate three lowest eigenfunctions of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath129 @xcite , one can write the localized basis states @xmath130 , @xmath131 and then substitute it into the macroscopic wave function @xmath132 , being the time dependence included in @xmath133 .",
    "thus , by neglecting constant energy factors proportional to @xmath134 we arrive at the equations @xmath135 and @xmath136 where @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath52 , represent the particle population in wells left , center and right respectively .",
    "the stationary states of the non - linear schrdinger equation are @xmath142 .",
    "thus , by assuming @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 , and substituting @xmath146 we find    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the dimensionless energy per particle @xmath149 , and @xmath150 measures the phase difference among the condensates in wells @xmath15 and @xmath151 .",
    "one can see that @xmath148 is a function of @xmath96 and @xmath97 and , thus , we require to explore such a phase space to determine the values that produce a solution @xmath148 for a given value of @xmath35 .",
    "this can be done by associating a classical hamiltonian the constant energy @xmath148 , and then imposing stationarity to the corresponding hamilton equations for the conjugate variables @xmath152 .",
    "such stationary solutions correspond to maximum , minimum or saddle points .",
    "the stability character of each solution was determined by means of the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath153 , being @xmath154 the phase difference @xmath97 or the population @xmath96 . from the eigenvalues of this matrix we established if a given stationary solution corresponds to a maximum , minimum or saddle point .",
    "we recall that these extrema correspond to having all the eigenvalues negatives , all the eigenvalues positive or eigenvalues with different signs , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ figa ] we summarize all the stationary states consistent with the hamilton equations for @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in the same figure",
    "we indicate the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix associated to each stationary solution to distinguish the stability character of each solution .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that there is a discrepancy in the number of stationary states predicted by each approach .",
    "we attribute such lack of compatibility to the essential difference between the two approaches , namely that mf treatment is always an effective equation for one - body properties , while the bh approach considers one- and two - body terms from which effects of @xmath21-body properties ( with @xmath155 ) can be tracked down .",
    "in particular , the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the eigenstate basis , the energy spectrum , which is a two - body property .",
    "this allows us to stress that within the mf approach , in general , neither stationary properties nor dynamical ones involving two or more bodies can be extracted . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of particle - particle collisions within the bh approach does permit probing any arbitrary @xmath156particle property , either stationary or dynamical .",
