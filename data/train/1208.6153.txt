    "magic squares ( ms s ) , arrays of lie algebras enjoying remarkable symmetry properties under reflection with respect to their main diagonal , were discovered long time ago by freudenthal , rozenfeld and tits @xcite , and their structure and fascinating properties have been studied extensively in mathematics and mathematical physics , especially in relation to exceptional lie algebras ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    following the seminal papers by gnaydin , sierra and townsend @xcite , ms s have been related to the generalized electric - magnetic ( @xmath4-)duality - duality is referred to as the continuous  symmetries of @xcite .",
    "their discrete versions are the @xmath4-duality non - perturbative string theory symmetries introduced by hull and townsend @xcite . ]",
    "symmetries of particular classes of maxwell - einstein supergravity theories ( mesgt s ) , called _ magic _ ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , non - compact , real forms of lie algebras , corresponding to non - compact symmetries of ( super)gravity theories , have become relevant as symmetries of the corresponding rank-@xmath0 _ simple _ jordan algebras @xcite , defined over normed division ( @xmath9 ) or split ( @xmath10 ) composition algebras @xcite .    later on , some other ms s have been constructed in literature through the exploitation of tits formula @xcite ( _ cfr . _",
    "( [ tits - formula ] ) below ) .",
    "on the other hand , the role of _ lorentzian _ rank-@xmath0 simple jordan algebras in constructing unified mesgt s in @xmath11 and @xmath2 lorentzian space - time dimensions ( through the determination of the cubic chern - simons @xmath12 coupling in the lagrangian density ) has been investigated in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on tits formula ( and its trialitarian reformulation , namely vinberg s formula @xcite ; _ cfr . _",
    "( [ vinberg ] ) below ) , and construct and classify all possible ms structures consistent with euclidean or lorentzian rank-@xmath0 simple jordan algebras .",
    "we also elucidate the ms structure , in terms of maximal and symmetric embeddings on their rows and columns .",
    "it should be remarked that most of the ms s which we determine ( classified according to the sequences of algebras entering their rows and columns ) are new and never appeared in literature .",
    "indeed , as mentioned above , before the present survey only particular types of ms s , exclusively related to euclidean jordan algebras , were known , namely the original freudenthal - rozenfeld - tits ( frt ) ms @xmath13  @xcite , the single - split supergravity gnaydin - sierra - townsend ( gst ) ms @xmath14 @xcite , and the double - split barton - sudbery ( bs ) ms @xmath15 @xcite ( which also appeared in @xcite ) . besides these ones , only a particular mixed \" ms  ( denoted as @xmath16 in our classification ; see below ) recently appeared in @xcite , in the framework of an explicit construction of a manifestly maximally covariant symplectic frame for the special khler geometry of the scalar fields of @xmath17 magic mesgt s .",
    "the entries of the last row/ column of the magic squares have been computed also in @xcite , depending on the norm of the composition algebras involved .",
    "furthermore , we elucidate the role and the meaning of the various non - compact , real forms of lie algebras as symmetries of einstein - maxwell gravity theories coupled to non - linear sigma models of scalar fields , possibly endowed with local supersymmetry .",
    "we consider @xmath4-dualities in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 space - time dimensions , with the standard lorentzian signature or with other , more exotic signatures , such as the euclidean one and others with two timelike dimensions .",
    "interestingly , symmetries pertaining to particular compactifications of @xmath18-dimensional theories alternative to @xmath19-theory , namely to the so - called @xmath5-theory and @xmath6-theory @xcite , appear in this framework .",
    "frequently , the lie algebras entering the ms s also enjoy an interpretation as stabilizers of certain orbits of an irreducible representation of the @xmath4-duality itself , in which the ( abelian ) field strengths of the theory sit ( possibly , along with their duals ) .",
    "the _ stratification _ of the related representation spaces under @xmath4-duality has been extensively studied in the supergravity literature , starting from @xcite ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a brief introduction ) , in relation to extremal black hole solutions and their attractor behaviour ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "a remarkable role is played by exceptional lie algebras .",
    "it is worth observing that the particular non - compact real forms possibly arising at group level @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 , occurring as particular symmetries of flux configurations supporting non - supersymmetric attractors in magic mesgt s , can be obtained in the framework of ms s _ only _ by considering _ lorentzian _",
    "rank-@xmath0 jordan algebras on division or split algebras .",
    "thus , the present investigation not only classifies all ms s based on rank-@xmath0 euclidean or lorentzian simple jordan algebras , but also clarifies their role in generating non - compact symmetries of the corresponding ( possibly , locally supersymmetric ) theories of gravity in various dimensions and signatures of space - time .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .    in  sec .",
    "[ sec - ms ] , we recall some basic facts and definitions on rank-@xmath0 ( _ alias _ cubic ) jordan algebras and ms s , and present tits and vinberg s formul , which will be crucial for our classification .    then , in sec . [ sec - eucl - ms ] we compute and classify all @xmath22 ms s based on rank-3 simple ( generic ) jordan algebras of _ euclidean _ type .",
    "we recover the known frt , gst and bs ms s , and other 7 independent ms arrays , and we analyze the role of the corresponding symmetries in ( super)gravity theories .",

    "in particular , the lorentzian frt ms ( table  [ tab11 ] ) , which is symmetric and contains only non - compact lie algebras , is relevant to certain ( non - supersymmetric ) attractors in the corresponding theory .",
    "a detailed analysis of the ms structure , and further group - theoretical and physical considerations , are given in the concluding sec .",

    "we start by briefly recalling the definition of a magic square : a _ magic square _ ( ms ) is an array of lie algebras @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are normed division or split composition algebras which label the rows and columns , respectively .",

    "the multiplication rule of the octonions is described by the fano plane :        [ fig1 ]    let @xmath33 be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow .",
    "then the multiplication is given by : @xmath34 together with : @xmath35 @xmath36 denotes the imaginary octonions .",
    "the split octonions @xmath37 can be obtained e.g. by substituting the imaginary units @xmath38 , @xmath39 , so that they satisfy @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we construct and classify all possible magic squares ( ms s ) related to euclidean or lorentzian rank-@xmath0 simple jordan algebras , both on normed division algebras and split composition algebras . besides the known freudenthal - rozenfeld - tits ms , the single - split gnaydin - sierra - townsend ms , and the double - split barton - sudbery ms , we obtain other 7 euclidean and 10 lorentzian novel ms s .    </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the role and the meaning of the various non - compact real forms of lie algebras , entering the ms s as symmetries of theories of einstein - maxwell gravity coupled to non - linear sigma models of scalar fields , possibly endowed with local supersymmetry , in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 space - time dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , such symmetries can be recognized as the @xmath4-dualities or the stabilizers of scalar manifolds within space - time with standard lorentzian signature or with other , more exotic signatures , also relevant to suitable compactifications of the so - called @xmath5- and @xmath6- theories . </S>",
    "<S> symmetries pertaining to some attractor @xmath4-orbits of magic supergravities in lorentzian space - time also arise in this framework .     </S>",
