    "the dynamics of quantum systems far from equilibrium present many conceptual challenges , particularly in the area of quantum glasses .",
    "the classical analogues of these systems display broad relaxation spectra ; furthermore their long - time behavior depends explicitly on details of sample history . in this paper",
    "a motivating question is whether the introduction of quantum fluctuations in a classical system out of equilibrium results in qualitatively new behavior at long time - scales . to date , the introduction of quantum fluctuations in theoretical glassy models has not led to qualitative changes , e.g. , new slow quantum modes , in their long - time dynamics @xcite .",
    "quantum fluctuations often drive the glass transition to be first - order @xcite , and thus only qualitatively affect the dynamical behavior on _ short_-time scales .",
    "however there are examples where , in the absence of dissipation , quantum fluctuations lead to a quantum critical point at zero temperature ; examples include the periodic josephson array @xcite and infinite - component quantum rotors @xcite . detailed characterization of the phase space as a function of dissipation , temperature , and quantum fluctuations remains to be studied in both cases .",
    "careful experimental studies of the dipolar magnet @xmath1 indicate that the current theoretical picture of quantum glassy systems is not the full story @xcite . an appropriate model for the description of the magnetic properties of this material",
    "consists of ising spins , representing the states of the magnetic ions , residing on random sites , and interacting via short - range ferromagnetic couplings and long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the sign of the latter interaction depends on the relative position of the spins , leading to the possibility of competing interactions and to frustration . for @xmath2 , the short - range component of the interaction dominates and the system is a ferromagnet .",
    "however , the curie temperature decreases as @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "the effects of quantum mechanics can be tuned in this system by application of a magnetic field transverse to the spins . even in the disordered ferromagnetic state ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "there are qualitative effects of the transverse field , particularly near the observed quantum critical point , that have not been described by theoretical models @xcite .    motivated by these experiments , we study the dynamics of a long - range quantum disordered ferromagnet , the quantum spherical model with gaussian random two - spin interactions ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "classically the statics of this model are trivial , as the free energy has only two minima , and it can be solved exactly with a replica symmetric ansatz @xcite . however , for almost any initial conditions , the dynamics of this classical system are out - of equilibrium with power - law decays in many of the observed quantities @xcite .",
    "the origin of this slow relaxation is very different from that of classical mean - field spin glasses . in these latter systems",
    "the time evolution is determined by the complex structure of the phase space @xcite .",
    "by contrast the free energy landscape of the @xmath0 case is very simple .",
    "however , statistically the overlap between the initial and the equilibrium configurations is very small .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the situation in a weakly disordered ferromagnet after a rapid temperature quench where the resulting domain structure bears little resemblance to the uniform equilibrium state .",
    "for this reason we refer to the non - ergodic phases of the @xmath0 spherical model as coarsened .",
    "naturally the infinite - range nature of this hamiltonian implies the absence of any length - scale in real - space",
    ". the spherical character of the spins combined with the quadratic interaction lead to reduced nonlinearities in this disordered @xmath0 model , even compared to other mean - field spin glasses .",
    "these two key features , specifically the infinite - range coupling and the minimal nonlinearities , make this model amenable to analytic treatment , and it can serve as a testing ground for necessary assumptions made in more complicated glassy systems .",
    "the disordered quantum @xmath0 spherical model bears a strong resemblance to that of the infinite - range @xmath5-component quantum rotors in the limit @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the @xmath5-component quantum rotor hamiltonian is composed of @xmath5 replicas which each individually resemble the @xmath0 system , where the inter - replica coupling scales inversely with @xmath5 @xcite . here",
    "we extend previous studies of these and related rotor hamiltonians @xcite by performing a detailed characterization of the phase behavior of the disordered quantum @xmath0 spherical model , noting that our results recover those previously obtained in particular well - defined limits .    in this study",
    "we characterize the phase behavior of the disordered @xmath0 spherical model as a function of quantum and thermal fluctuations and the spin - bath coupling ; we identify its distinct paramagnetic and coarsened regions by studying its long - time dynamical behavior .",
    "known results are reproduced in both the high- and the zero- temperature limits .",
    "we also demonstrate analytically that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem remains valid in the stationary regime .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ fotp ]",
    "we present the model .",
    "its dynamical equations , which we derive using the keldysh formalism , are discussed in section [ deqs ] .",
    "the stationary parts of the retarded and the statistical green functions , that we find in section [ stationary ] , are then shown analytically to obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in section [ ea ]",
    "an expression for the edwards - anderson order parameter is presented with the resulting emergence of a quantum critical point .",
    "details of the phase diagram are discussed in section [ pd ] for all the coarsened and the paramagnetic regions .",
    "we end with a discussion , section [ discussion ] , where , after summarizing the main features of this work , we mention several open questions that emerge from our study .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of the disordered quantum @xmath0 spherical spin glass model coupled to an ohmic bath .",
    "there are @xmath7 spins that can be written in vector form as @xmath8 , and we will assume that @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the free , the spin - spin , the bath , and the spin - bath contributions respectively .    in the absence of interactions the free hamiltonian of the spin system",
    "is given by @xmath15 where the conjugated momenta @xmath16 obey the usual commutation relations @xmath17=[\\pi_{i},\\pi_{j}]=0 $ ] , and @xmath18=-i \\delta_{ij}$ ] ; here we use a unit system where @xmath19 .",
    "the `` mass ''",
    "@xmath20 is a constant that introduces dynamics into the problem .",
    "as we will explain below , the dynamics of the system can be tuned from the classical to the quantum regimes by varying the mass @xmath20 .",
    "we note that there are other methods of quantization ( e.g. application of a transverse field ) besides this `` kinetic '' one ; if done correctly , they should all yield the same results @xcite .",
    "the spins interact with each other via a spin - spin interaction which , for the @xmath0 model , is given by @xmath21 = \\sum_{i_{1}<i_{2}}^{n } j_{i_{1}i_{2 } } s_{i_{1 } }    s_{i_{2}},\\ ] ] with randomly distributed matrix elements @xmath22 , that obey @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents averaging over the random spin - spin interaction .    in the spherical model the spins , @xmath27 , are constrained to a spherical surface such that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 represent quantum averaging .",
    "thus @xmath27 are continuous variables , that behave like coordinates . however ,",
    "since this model has been introduced as an analytically accessible spin problem , we will keep the notation and the nomenclature .",
    "the spherical constraint is initially introduced into the lagrangian , which results in the additional term , @xmath30 , in the hamiltonian .",
    "the time - dependent function , @xmath31 , is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "thus the free hamiltonian @xmath11 ( [ h0 ] ) , is effectively replaced by @xmath32    each spin in the system is connected to a system of @xmath33 independent harmonic oscillators that constitute the bath .",
    "the free hamiltonian of the bath is given by @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are the oscillator coordinates of mode @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the coordinate of the oscillator that interacts with spin @xmath27 .",
    "the conjugate momenta @xmath38 are related to @xmath39 through the commutation relations @xmath40=[p_{ai},p_{aj}]=0 $ ] , and @xmath41=-i \\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the mass and frequency of mode @xmath36 of the oscillators are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for simplicity we assume a linear interaction between the spins and the bath @xcite @xmath44=\\sum_{a=1}^{n_{\\rm b}}\\ , c_{a } { \\bf x}_{a }    \\cdot { \\bf s},\\ ] ] where the coupling coefficients are given by @xmath45 .",
    "we are aware that this model for a bath can lead to unwanted divergencies due to low - frequency contributions in the absence of an infrared cut - off @xcite .",
    "however , this problem does not arise in our case due to the structure of the relevant spectral density , as we discuss later in the paper .",
    "such a simple interaction between the spin system and the bath allows us to solve the problem analytically .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spin system is actually that of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "because the coupling to the bath ( [ spin - b - int ] ) is linear in the spin operator , it does not alter this statement . in the paramagnetic phase the spin - spin interaction is negligible , and we recognize that @xmath46 is the eigenenergy of the oscillator .",
    "we are interested in the long - time behavior of @xmath31 when it saturates to a constant @xmath47 . in order to understand whether the dynamics of the spin system are governed by classical or quantum fluctuations",
    ", we compare the important energy - scale of the system to the temperature @xmath48 . at constant @xmath48 when @xmath20 is increased , the eigenenergy of the spin hamiltonian decreases .",
    "once the dominant energy - scale is smaller than @xmath48 , the system dynamics are governed by classical behavior .",
    "similarly , when @xmath20 is decreased , @xmath48 becomes smaller than the dominant energy - scale , and quantum dynamics become more important . as a cautionary aside",
    ", we note that @xmath47 may depend on @xmath20 in the paramagnetic regime ; however we will show that to leading order it is either independent of @xmath20 or proportional to @xmath49 , so that the preceding heuristic argument is still valid .",
    "in the coarsened phase the spin - spin coupling can not be neglected . after averaging over this interaction ,",
    "it is harder to recognize the eigenenergies .",
    "however , the results presented here indicate that when the coupling to the bath is infinitesimal , the signatory parameter is @xmath50 : for @xmath3 large , the dynamics are dominated by classical effects whereas for @xmath3 small quantum effects are involved .",
    "it is only at @xmath51 that the dynamics are purely quantum in nature .",
    "we conclude therefore that the energy - scales @xmath48 and @xmath52 should be compared in order to find whether the dynamics are purely classical or partially quantum ( except at @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the previous discussion of the paramagnetic phase , where small mass corresponds to a regime where quantum fluctuations could become dominant .",
    "the dynamics of the spin system can be characterized by dyson equations associated with its green functions .",
    "here we use a nonequilibrium diagrammatic description , the keldysh technique @xcite , and take the initial conditions to be random .",
    "two green functions , or rather three _ real _ functions , are needed to describe the system , they are the retarded and the statistical ( or keldysh ) green functions , that are defined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively . for the @xmath0 spherical model the green functions are diagonal in the spin index , due to both the disorder averaging , and the infinite - range nature of the interaction .",
    "the retarded green function is proportional to the `` response '' in the spin glass nomenclature , while the statistical green function is proportional to the `` correlation '' . at equal times",
    "we demand that @xmath55 due to the spherical constraint , thus setting @xmath31 .    when a system is at equilibrium the green functions that describe it are a function of the time difference only .",
    "in that case one can fourier transform @xmath56 and @xmath57 over the time difference to obtain @xmath58 and @xmath59 . furthermore , at equilibrium the retarded and the statistical green functions are related via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xmath60 where @xmath48 is the equilibrium temperature of the system .",
    "when the spin system is in the paramagnetic phase , it is in equilibrium , and therefore it obeys fdt .",
    "although in the coarsened phase the system is _ not _ in equilibrium , we will show that one can identify unique stationary contributions to the retarded and the statistical green functions , that are related via the fdt , where the temperature is that of the bath .",
    "when the spin system is in the coarsened phase , the green functions depend on _ both _ times , and not only on the time difference .",

    "this is a result of two model - dependant features : ( i ) that @xmath0 , ( ii ) that the coupling to the bath is linear in the spin operators . in a @xmath69 model , or in any @xmath70 model with a nonlinear coupling to the bath ,",
    "the equation for the retarded green function would include the statistical green function as well .",
    "the detailed nature of the relaxation of a spin system far from equilibrium depends on the time it has spent in its low - temperature phase before the start of the measurement .",
    "this phenomenon is known as aging .",
    "this dynamical behavior has been described using scaling and other phenomenological approaches @xcite .",
    "more recently aging has been studied analytically in microscopic models where mean - field models are exact @xcite .",
    "it was realized that in these infinite - range systems the time evolution is dominated by motion in flat directions in phase space rather than by transitions over barriers ; with random initial conditions , the system continues to evolve and never approaches its local equilibrium .",
    "for this `` weak - ergodicity '' breaking scenario @xcite , it is crucial that the dimensionality of phase space is very large . because the spin system is out of equilibrium , its memory of its initial states will depend specifically on the time when the measurement commenced , @xmath71 , and the time when it ended , @xmath72 , and not simply the time difference , @xmath73 . in the weak - ergodicity breaking scenario ,",
    "if the waiting - time @xmath71 is finite , the system can evolve in the long - time limit so as to lose complete memory of its initial configuration at @xmath71 .",
    "this assumption of weak long - term memory has been shown to be self - consistent for several classical long - range glassy and coarsened models @xcite . in the quantum case , it is expected to hold in general @xcite , though it may be violated near a quantum critical point where the decoherence time diverges .",
    "we assume that the weak - ergodicity breaking scenario applies to our system , and look for a solution that obeys it . more specifically , according to the weak - ergodicity breaking scenario , one expects the statistical green function to decay in the following manner @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",

    "[ gs - t->inf ] ) at equal times yields @xmath84    in order to write the dyson equations ( [ de - gr - t])-([de - gs - t ] ) , we need the contribution of the bath to the self - energy [ see ( [ self - energy ] ) ] . in the frequency domain",
    "the free - bath green functions for mode @xmath36 , that are associated with the free - bath hamiltonian @xmath85 , are given by @xmath86 @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the bath temperature .",
    "fourier transforming into the time domain one obtains @xmath88    we assume that the bath is in equilibrium , namely that it is so large that it is unaffected by its interaction with the spin system .",
    "therefore we take the bath green functions to be those in ( [ da - r - w ] ) and ( [ da - s - w ] ) , that depend only on the time difference .",
    "thus the contributions of the bath to the self - energy are also time - translationally invariant . furthermore , they are linear in the bath green functions .",
    "they are obtained by multiplying the green function of each mode by its density of states , @xmath89 , and by the spin - bath coupling constant squared @xmath90 , and summing over all modes @xmath91 for the retarded self - energy , and @xmath92 for the statistical self - energy , where @xcite @xmath93 the bath temperature @xmath48 enters the equations for the spin green functions only through the bath contribution to the statistical self - energy .    in the case of an ohmic bath @xmath94 @xcite , where @xmath95 is a dimensionless coupling constant , and",

    "thus for the case of an ohmic bath @xmath97 when @xmath98 one can fourier transform ( [ drt - o ] ) and obtain @xmath99 it would seem that since @xmath100 , the limit @xmath98 is problematic .",
    "however , as we will show , @xmath101 disappears from the equations for the spin green functions .",
    "since the bath is in equilibrium it must obey the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , so that @xmath102",
    ". thus @xmath103 this result can also be obtained from ( [ dst ] ) with the ohmic density of states , directly .",
    "in this section we treat the retarded green function @xmath104 at large times @xmath80 and @xmath71 , such that @xmath105 , while @xmath106 is finite .",
    "we show that it is stationary , and that it is related to the stationary part of the statistical green function via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath31 is simply a function of one time variable , therefore for large @xmath80 it should saturate to a constant value @xmath107 .",
    "we assume that in the coarsened phase @xmath47 is independent of temperature , which indeed turns out to be consistent with our findings . since @xmath108 is independent of temperature , from eq .",
    "( [ de - gr - t ] ) it is evident that once @xmath31 saturates to @xmath47 , @xmath104 no longer depends on temperature .",
    "this agrees with the classical result found in @xcite . since @xmath104 does not depend on @xmath109 , which is expected to age , one can find a time - translational solution for @xmath110 , once @xmath47 is approached",
    "this is a peculiarity of the @xmath0 model , with the linear spin - bath coupling , since the retarded green function is independent of the statistical green function .",
    "we note that , consistent with our present discussion , no aging was found in the response of the infinite - range @xmath5-component rotors in the limit @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the time - translational invariance of @xmath110 for large times can be understood from a heuristic point of view . because the response function is decoupled from its statistical counterpart , it is independent of @xmath48 , and therefore must behave in the same manner for all temperatures . at very large @xmath48 ,",
    "the system is paramagnetic and thus the response is time - translationally invariant .",
    "thus it must exhibit this behavior at all temperatures .",

    "we use the spherical constraint and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the stationary regime to characterize the phase behavior of the system .",
    "more specifically , the long - time behavior of @xmath115 , the lagrange multiplier that enforces the spherical constraint , is crucial for distinguishing different paramagnetic regimes .",
    "similarly the edwards - anderson order parameter , @xmath77 , determined from the stationary statistical green function ( fdt ) and matching conditions at equal - times ( spherical constraint ) , characterizes different coarsened phases .",
    "we find that all the boundaries between the paramagnetic and the coarsened regions , determined by the @xmath136 lines , in the @xmath170 and the @xmath51 planes are continuous ; this is in marked contrast to the situation for quantum @xmath69 spherical models where quantum fluctuations at @xmath51 drive the transition first - order @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we identify a quantum critical point for @xmath51 and @xmath170 that coincides with the one found for a model of infinite - range , infinite - component quantum rotors in the absence of dissipation @xcite .    the edwards - anderson order parameter is used to probe the different types of coarsened phases ; here @xmath115 is a constant ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "more specifically , the behavior of @xmath77 determines whether the system s dynamics are dominated by classical or by quantum energy - scales . from our results , it is clear that the increase of either quantum or thermal fluctuations ( c.f .",
    "[ fig - b=0 ] and [ fig - t=0 ] ) , by raising the inverse - mass or the temperature respectively , leads to the destabilization of the coarsened phase .",
    "furthermore an increase of the spin - bath coupling , @xmath95 , causes a decay of the quantum fluctuations ; the inverse - mass must be enhanced still further to approach the phase boundary .",
    "finally for constant mass and increasing @xmath95 at low temperatures , an increase in @xmath48 is necessary to cross the @xmath136 phase boundary ( c.f .",
    "[ fig - tvsm ] ) ; the effect of the spin - bath coupling is significantly reduced at higher @xmath48 .    in the paramagnetic phase , @xmath245 , and the system is characterized by its long - time lagrange multiplier , @xmath115 , which enforces the spherical constraint . in both the @xmath170 and the @xmath51 planes ( c.f . figs .",
    "[ fig - b=0 ] and [ fig - t=0 ] , respectively ) a quantum paramagnetic phase exists in the limit of vanishing mass .",
    "however in the @xmath170 case there are crossovers between different paramagnetic regions as both temperature and mass are increased , corresponding to states where classical energy - scales assume increasing importance compared to their quantum counterparts .",
    "the simplicity of this quantum @xmath0 spherical model is both its blessing and its curse .",
    "it is exactly this feature that permits us to show explicitly the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the stationary regime ; furthermore this system is accessible to analytic study in the limit of vanishing dissipation .",
    "however , we should also point out that here the response is _ always _ independent of temperature , a feature that makes it particularly awkward for comparison with experiment in the classical and quantum regimes .",
    "furthermore we do not have any spatial information , so possible overlap with real coarsening measurements is rather difficult .",
    "however some dialogue between theory and experiment may be possible near the quantum critical point , where issues of length - scales assume reduced importance . as a first step towards making such contact with experiment",
    ", we need to establish whether the quantum critical point studied here is in the same universality class as that of the ising model in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "it is intuitive to relate the latter to the @xmath246 quantum rotor case @xcite , which would suggest that it is in a different universality class from the @xmath0 quantum spherical model ( that strongly resembles the @xmath6 case ) studied here .",
    "however the distinction between continuous and discrete spin symmetries may be important @xcite , so this argument is inconclusive . on another note",
    ", it is known that one can glean spatial information from the study of the classical @xmath0 spherical model by exploiting a mapping on long time - scales to the three dimensional @xmath247 model @xcite , and an analogous mapping should be explored for the quantum system .",
    "finally we plan to characterize the dynamics of this simple system near its quantum critical point in order to study whether it has any slow relaxational modes that are not shared by its classical counterpart .    _ note added in proof _ : recently , we learned of earlier studies @xcite of the critical behavior of quantum rotors at finite dissipation . in the relevant parameter regime",
