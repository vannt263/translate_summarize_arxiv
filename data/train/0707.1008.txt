    "( here @xmath32 denotes the identity matrix of dimension @xmath0 . ) throughout the paper the channel matrix @xmath33 is assumed to be of full rank .    for each transmitter",
    "we impose the same average block power constraint on the sequence of channel inputs , i.e. , @xmath34    we say that a rate - tuple @xmath35 is achievable if there exists a sequence of pairs of encoding schemes satisfying and decoding schemes such that in the limit as @xmath8 tends to infinity the probability of a decoding error at each receiver tends to 0 . note that each receiver bases its decision on the signal it receives only . denoting by @xmath36 the sum of the rates @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 we can define the sum - rate capacity @xmath39 as the supremum of the sum - rates over all achievable rate tuples .    in this work we focus on the behavior of the sum - rate capacity @xmath40 in the high snr regime , i.e. , in the limit when @xmath41 . in particular , the quantity of interest in this regime is the limit of the ratio of the sum - rate capacity to the gaussian single - user channel capacity when the available power tends to infinity : @xmath42 the limiting ratio @xmath43 determines the logarithmic growth of the sum - rate capacity at high power , and we will refer to it as the pre - log of the network .",

    "is already known to be equal @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , for _ partial side - information _ settings and for _ no side - information _ settings the pre - log is not yet known for general interference networks . but see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for some special networks .",
    "in @xcite the two - transmitters / two - receivers interference network with _ no side - information _ is investigated .",
    "the results therein include the result that the pre - log of the setting equals 1 and furthermore even characterize the capacity region of the network to within 1 bit .",
    "the pre - log of the two - transmitters / two - receivers network with _ partial side - information _ was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that for no _ partial side - information _ setting the pre - log is larger than 1 ; only _ full side - information _ yields the `` full '' pre - log 2 .    the more general scenario where both transmitters and both receivers can communicate with multiple antennas",
    "is treated in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that our setting does not include as a special case the x - channel where each transmitter sends independent messages to the _ two _ receivers @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the described works in this submission we consider networks with generally more than two transmitters and receivers .    recently , the authors @xcite considered a particular example of an interference network with more than two transmitters and more than two receivers .",
    "they showed that in interference networks _ partial side - information _ settings can exist with a larger pre - log than in the _ no side - information _ setting .",
    "in particular , the authors considered an interference network where the channel matrix is given by the matrix with ones on the diagonal , some constant @xmath46 on the first lower secondary diagonal , and 0 everywhere else .",
    "thus , in the considered network , receiver  @xmath2 observes the sum of transmitter  @xmath2 s input signal , transmitter  @xmath47 s input signal scaled by the factor @xmath46 , and additive white gaussian noise . for this network",
    "it was shown that partial side - information can increase the pre - log significantly and even lead to the `` full '' pre - log @xmath0 , the same pre - log as in the _ full side - information _ setting .",
    "thus , we see that for the two - transmitters / two - receivers interference network described in @xcite and for the interference network described in @xcite the impact of _ partial side - information _ on the pre - log is drastically different .",
    "this fact might not seem so surprising to the reader since the two networks have a very different structure .",
    "however , it is not clear which properties of a network determine how _ partial side - information _ influences the pre - log .",
    "in fact we will show later in this paper that for the two similar networks with channel matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 the dependence of the pre - log on the message sets @xmath50 is completely different . for networks with channel matrix @xmath51 in the _ no side - information _ setting the pre - log equals 1 , and there are _ partial side - information _ settings with pre - log equal 2 and _ partial side - information _ settings with pre - log 3 .",
    "in contrast , for networks with channel matrix @xmath52 , in any _ partial side - information _ setting and in the _ no side - information _ setting the pre - log equals 2 and only in the _ full side - information _ setting the pre - log equals 3 .",
    "in this section we state the main results of our work . for proofs we refer to a forthcoming longer version of this paper .",
    "we begin by stating for which interference network settings we can determine the pre - log exactly based on the lower bound and the upper bound derived in the last two subsections . in the second subsection",
    "we characterize when _ partial side - information _ can increase the pre - log , and in the third subsection we give some examples of specific networks to illustrate the results in the previous two subsections . in the subsection before last we describe an encoding scheme  the _ linear partial - cancelation _",
    "scheme leading to the lower bound on the pre - log . finally , in the last subsection we describe how to derive the upper bound on the pre - log .      for general interference settings",
    "there is a gap between the upper bound and the lower bound obtained with a linear partial - cancelation scheme .",
    "nevertheless , for certain networks the two bounds meet , thus demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of the linear partial - cancelation scheme .",
    "examples of such settings include the setting described in @xcite and also  for any given message sets @xmath50the fully connected 2-by-2 interference networks and the networks with channel matrix @xmath52 given in . for _ no side - information _ settings and for certain _ partial side - information _ settings the bounds also meet for networks with channel matrix @xmath51 given in .",
    "also , the lower bound and the upper bound also meet for all settings where @xmath53 and ( trivially ) where @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 , which is given ahead in , is the best pre - log achieved with a linear partial - cancelation scheme .",

    "this result is somewhat surprising since for certain interference networks the pre - log can indeed be a non - integer value .",
    "an example of an interference network with non - integer pre - log is given in section [ sec : enc ] .",

    "the matrices satisfying these conditions can be illustrated as follows : @xmath71 where the index of the row with @xmath72 occurrences of `` @xmath73 '' is the same as the index of the column with @xmath72 occurrences of `` @xmath73 '' . at all positions which are marked by an `` @xmath73 ''",
    "the matrix @xmath33 must contain a non - zero element , but these elements do not have to be identical . at the position which is marked by `` ? ''",

    "we propose an encoding scheme ",
    "the linear partial - cancelation scheme  for an arbitrary interference network with channel matrix @xmath33 and message sets @xmath50 as described in section  [ sec : intro ] .",

    "<S> we present both upper and lower bounds on the network s pre - log . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bounds are based on a linear partial - cancellation scheme which entails linearly transforming gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the interference in a subset of the receivers .    </S>",
    "<S> _ inter alias _ , the bounds give a complete characterization of the networks and side - information settings that result in a full pre - log , i.e. , in a pre - log that is equal to the number of transmitters ( and receivers ) as well as a complete characterization of networks whose pre - log is equal to the full pre - log minus one . </S>",
    "<S> they also fully characterize networks where the full pre - log can only be achieved if each transmitter knows the messages of all users , i.e. , when the side - information is `` full '' . </S>"
