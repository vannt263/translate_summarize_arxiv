    "graph pebbling is a network optimization model for transporting discrete resources that are consumed in transit : while two pebbles cross an edge of a graph , only one arrives at the other end as the other is consumed ( or lost to a toll , one can imagine ) .",
    "this operation is called a _ pebbling step_. the basic questions in the subject revolve around deciding if a particular configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a graph can _ reach _ a given _ root _",

    "if a configuration can reach @xmath5 , it is called @xmath5-_solvable _ , and @xmath5-_unsolvable _ otherwise .",
    "various rules for pebbling steps have been studied for years and have found applications in a wide array of areas .",
    "one version , dubbed _ black and white _ pebbling , was applied to computational complexity theory in studying time - space tradeoffs ( see @xcite ) , as well as to optimal register allocation for compilers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "connections have been made also to pursuit and evasion games and graph searching ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another ( _ black _ pebbling ) is used to reorder large sparse matrices to minimize in - core storage during an out - of - core cholesky factorization scheme ( see @xcite ) . a third version yields results in computational geometry in the rigidity of graphs , matroids , and other structures",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "the rule we study here originally produced results in combinatorial number theory and combinatorial group theory ( the existence of zero sum subsequences  see @xcite ) and have recently been applied to finding solutions in @xmath6-adic diophantine equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "most of these rules give rise to computationally difficult problems , which we discuss for our case below .",
    "we follow fairly standard graph terminology ( e.g. @xcite ) , with a graph @xmath7 having @xmath8 vertices @xmath9 and having edges @xmath10 . the _ eccentricity _",

    "surveys on the topic can be found in @xcite , and include variations on the theme such as @xmath29-pebbling , fractional pebbling , optimal pebbling , cover pebbling , and pebbling thresholds , as well as applications to combinatorial number theory and combinatorial group theory ( see references ) .",
    "computing graph pebbling numbers is difficult in general .",

    ". then @xmath91 .",
    "the manner in which one uses this lemma to obtain a pebbling number upper bound is as follows .",
    "if we have several strategies @xmath92 of @xmath18 , each rooted at @xmath5 , with associated weight functions @xmath93 and configurations @xmath94 , then we can define the accumulated weight function @xmath95 and the accumulated configuration @xmath96 , and have that @xmath97 for every @xmath5-unsolvable configuration @xmath89 .",

    "we recall the theorem of @xcite that if @xmath18 is a @xmath31-connected , diameter @xmath31 graph then @xmath34 if and only if @xmath18 is a member of the following special class of graphs @xmath119 .",
    "first , @xmath119 contains the pyramid @xmath120 , as well as @xmath121 for any edge @xmath122 of the triangle @xmath38 .",

    "this means that @xmath153 because , otherwise , @xmath51 would require that every vertex is adjacent to the neighbor of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , @xmath154 implies that there are at least two cones different from @xmath5 , whose neighborhoods are disjoint .",
    "we remark first that , with eccentricity @xmath31 , the only nonsemigreedy move is one from distance @xmath35 to distance @xmath31 ; but if a move from distance @xmath35 is possible then it can move to @xmath5 immediately .",
    "therefore every @xmath5-solution can be converted to one which is semigreedy .",

    "we can make the above argument for each cone vertex ; thus we may assume that @xmath177 for every cone vertex .",
    "hence no neighbor of @xmath5 is adjacent to more than one cone vertex , and every neighbor of @xmath5 adjacent to some cone vertex must have no pebble .",
    "furthermore , if some @xmath178 has two pebbles then we can move pebbles greedily from @xmath77 to its common neighbor @xmath107 of @xmath5 , from @xmath15 to @xmath107 , and then from @xmath107 to @xmath5 .",
