    "the casimir effect is one of the most strinking consequences of quantum electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the ground state energy of the electromagnetic field upon boundary conditions gives rise to an observable force between macroscopic bodies .",
    "a significant enhancement in the accuracy of measuring the casimir force has been achieved recently with experiments employing the torsion pendulum and atomic force microscope ( afm )  @xcite .",
    "casimir effect investigations may open the way for experimental observation of new fundamental forces arising from the hypothetical extra dimension predicted by modern theories  @xcite .",
    "however , to enable such studies it is crucial to improve experimental techniques .    the casimir force in addition to its fundamental interest also plays an important role in the fabrication an operation of microelectromechanical systems  ( mems ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe the heat signaling in the simple nanostructure the parrarel plates heated by attosecond laser pulses .",
    "it will be shown that temperature field between plates depends on the distance of the plates . as the result",
    "the attosecond laser pulse can be used as the tool for the investigation of casimir effect on the performance of the mems .",
    "vacuum energy is a consequence of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field , which is composed of photons .",
    "a photon of frequency @xmath1 has energy @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is planck constant .",
    "the quantum vacuum can be interpreted as the lowest energy state ( or ground state ) of the electromagnetic ( em ) field that occurs when all charges and currents have been removed and the temperature has been reduced to absolute zero . in this state",
    "no ordinary photons are present .",
    "nevertheless , because the electromagnetic field is a quantum system the energy of the ground state of the em is not zero .",
    "although the average value of the electric field @xmath4 vanishes in ground state , the root mean square of the field @xmath5 is not zero .",
    "similarly the @xmath6 is not zero . therefore the electromagnetic field energy , @xmath7 is not equal zero .",
    "a detailed theoretical calculation tells that em energy in each mode of oscillation with frequency @xmath8 is @xmath9 , which equals one half of the amount of energy that would be present if a single `` real '' photon of that mode were present . adding up @xmath9 for all possible modes of the electromagnetic field gives a very large number for the vacuum energy @xmath10 in the quantum vacuum @xmath11 the resulting vacuum energy @xmath10 is _ infinity _ unless a high frequency cut off is applied .",
    "+ inserting surfaces into the vacuum causes the modes of the em to change .",
    "this change in the modes that are present occurs since the em must meet the appropriate boundary conditions at each surface .",
    "surface alter the modes of oscillation and therefore the surfaces alter the energy density corresponding to the lowest state of the em field . in actual practice",
    "the change in @xmath10 is defined as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy in empty space and @xmath14 is the energy in space with the surfaces , i.e. @xmath15 as an example let us consider a hollow conducting rectangular cavity with sides _ _ a__@xmath16 _ _ a__@xmath17 , _ _ a__@xmath18 . in that case for uncharged parallel plates with area _ a _",
    "the attractive force between the plates is ,  @xcite @xmath19 where _ d _ is the distance between plates .",
    "the force @xmath20 is called the parallel plate casimir force , which was measured in three different experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent calculations show that for conductive rectangular cavities the vacuum forces on a given face can be repulsive ( positive ) , attractive ( negative ) or zero depending on the ratio of the sides  @xcite .    in paper",
    "@xcite the first measurement of repulsive casimir force was performed . for the distance ( separation )",
    "@xmath21 m the repulsive force is of the order of @xmath22n ( micronewton )  for cavity geometry . in march 2001 ,",
    "scientist at lucent technology used attractive parallel plate casimir force to actuate a mems torsion device  @xcite .",
    "other mems ( microelectromechanical systems ) have been also proposed  @xcite .",
    "standard klein - gordon equation reads : @xmath23 in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath24 is the relativistic wave function for particle with mass _ m _ , _ c _ is the light velocity and @xmath3 is planck constant . for massless particles @xmath25 and eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is the maxwell equation for photons .",
    "as was shown by pauli and weisskopf since relativistic quantum mechanical equation had to allow for creation and anihilation of particles , the klein - gordon describes spin  0 bosons .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) _ t _ denotes temperature of the medium and _ v _ is the velocity of the temperature signal in the medium .",

    "the discussion of the physical properties of the solution of equation  ( [ eq8 ] ) can be find in  @xcite .",
    "in the paper we will study the heat signaling in the medium excited by ultra - short laser pulses , @xmath35 . in that case",
