    "the presence of multiple populations as a characterizing property of globular clusters ( gcs ) is widely accepted nowadays . since the first photometric and spectroscopic studies , which revealed multiple sequences ( e.g. dickens & woolley , 1967 ; lee et al . 1999 , 2009 ;",
    "bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) and/or light element ( anti)correlations ( see gratton et al .",
    "2004 ) , it became evident that gc stars are neither coeval nor chemically homogeneous .",
    "hence , gcs host at least two stellar generations .",
    "thanks to the advent of 8@xmath010 m class telescopes , which also allowed targeting fainter main - sequence ( ms ) stars , several abundance studies have shown that chemical ( anti)correlations are also present in unevolved ( ms / turnoff ( to ) ) or scarcely evolved ( sgb ) stars ( gratton et al . 2001 ; carretta et al . 2004 ; pasquini et al .",
    "this evidence implies that a previous generation of stars has activated cno , nena , and mgal cycles in their interiors , in order to deplete o and mg and enhance na and al , respectively .",
    "the origin / nature of such kind of stars is still debated with two coexistent scenarios : ( 1 ) intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in hot bottom burning phase ( ventura & dantona 2009 ) and ( 2 ) fast rotating massive stars ( frms ; decressin et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "our group has recently carried out an extensive survey , focusing on the determination of proton - capture elements in 19 gcs ( carretta et al .",
    "2009c ) , with the main objective of discovering and understanding the nature ( and the extent ) of the chemical ( anti)correlations and their link with global cluster parameters ( horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology , metallicity , etc . ) .",
    "the large sample of stars ( @xmath11200 gc members ) , analyzed in a very homogeneous and accurate way , revealed that while the na@xmath0o anticorrelation is present in all the gcs ( i.e. the second generation is not a  perturbation \" ) , the shape of the na@xmath0o distribution varies from cluster to cluster ( carretta et al .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of uves spectra for @xmath1 200 stars by carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) has shown that the mg@xmath0al anticorrelation is not present in all gcs .",
    "both these indications suggest that the typical polluter masses change from cluster to cluster : this variation is apparently driven by a combination of cluster luminosity and metallicity .    in this context ,",
    "lithium abundances offer a complementary approach to @xmath2-capture elements allowing to address several important issues .",
    "if no li is produced by the polluters , the multiple population scenario predicts that li and o are positively correlated , while li and na anticorrelated .",
    "na - poor , o / li - rich stars are the first population born in the cluster ( they share the same chemical composition of field stars at the same metallicity ) , and na - rich , o / li - poor stars constitute the second generation . within the same hypothesis",
    ", li is an excellent tracer of the dilution process acting within each star : only through li abundance determinations we can determine the amount of pristine ( and of polluted ) material present in each star .",
    "in particular , we hope to answer two fundamental questions : do 100% polluted stars ( li@xmath10 ) exist or even the most extreme population still contains a certain fraction of primordial matter ? also , is the minimum measurable li content the same for all gcs or does it vary from cluster to cluster ?    on the other hand , li offers the exciting chance to observationally constrain the nature of the polluters .",
    "if the progenitors of second generation stars are frms , they have destroyed their original li content . on the other hand ,",
    "if agb stars are responsible for intra - cluster pollution , they may have non - negligible li yield , given the li production via the  @xmath3be transport \" mechanism ( cameron & fowler 1971 ) . as a consequence",
    ", we can reveal if agb stars are responsible for gc pollution through two main observational evidences : ( 1 ) the presence of very li - rich stars among gc populations and ( 2 ) the lack of li@xmath0na anti - correlation ( or li@xmath0o correlation ) , with the second generation stars also showing a rather high li content . in a recent work",
    ", we focused on @xmath190 to stars belonging to the metal - rich gc 47 tuc : in this case , likely because of the high metallicity , a large star - to - star scatter in li abundances erases any li@xmath0na anticorrelation , while li and o appear to be only weakly positively correlated ( dorazi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the cluster seems to display a different behaviour from ngc  6752 and ngc  6397 : for the first one , pasquini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detected a significant li@xmath0na anticorrelation ( and also li@xmath0o correlation and li@xmath0n anticorrelation ) .",
    "concerning the second cluster , the situation seems more complex since lind et al .",
    "( 2009 ) detected a quite constant value in li abundances , with only three stars ( out of 100 ) driving a hint of li@xmath0na anticorrelation .",
    "enlarging the sample of simultaneous determinations of li and @xmath2-capture elements in gcs is hence of paramount importance : in this letter we present li results on the intermediate - metallicity ( [ fe / h]=-1.18 ; carretta et al .",
    "2009a ) cluster ngc  6121 ( m4 ) , by analyzing the same sample of a hundred red giant branch ( rgb ) stars studied by marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . as found by marino and coworkers , m4 hosts two distinct populations of stars , mainly characterized by a different sodium content ( i.e. , the na - rich and na - poor groups ) , and defining different sequences on the color@xmath0magnitude diagram @xmath4 versus ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we derived li abundances for the stars belonging to the two groups , and located both below and above the rgb bump luminosity ; this evolutionary stage plays a fundamental role in this context .",
    "theoretical models ( iben 1967 ) , confirmed by observations of field stars by gratton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , predict a depletion in li due to the first dredge - up ( 1dup ) of a factor of @xmath1 20 at the base of the sgb branch . on the lower rgb , below the bump luminosity , the molecular weight gradient associated with the h abundance jump acts as a barrier that prevents further extra mixing ( charbonnel et al .",
    "1994 ) ; then the li abundance remains constant until the rgb bump is reached . at this stage ,",
    "the h shell reaches and cancels this discontinuity and non - standard mixing processes ( non - convective extramixing , see , e.g. , charbonnel & zahn 2007 ) cause the total destruction of the remaining li .",
    "our sample consists of 104 rgb stars , whose spectra were acquired with flames on vlt / ut2 ( pasquini et al . 2002 ) with the fiber link to the high - resolution spectrograph uves ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a detailed description of observations , target properties , and data reduction and derivation of atmospheric parameters is provided in marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . adopting kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres and using the rosa abundance code ( gratton , 1988 ) , we derived li abundances by means of a spectral synthesis of the li  i resonance doublet at 6708  .",
    "we changed the cn values for the two different groups of na - rich and na - poor stars ( threshold value at [ na / fe]=0.2 dex ) in order to optimize the synthesis best fit and to account for the cn enhancement in the na - rich population ( see marino et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "abundances for nai along with stellar parameters and metallicity are the ones presented in marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . concerning li abundance ,",
    "error estimates have been computed in the same fashion as described in dorazi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , taking into account both stellar parameter and best - fit uncertainties ; for errors in na ( internal and systematic ) , we refer the reader to marino et al .",
    "stellar parameters and abundances are given in table  [ t : tab1 ] ( completely available in electronic version through cds ) .",
    "in figure  [ f : limag ] , we show the li abundances as a function of the absolute magnitude @xmath7 for all our sample stars : as expected , li disappears above the bump luminosity ( @xmath7=@xmath00.05@xmath80.10 ; ferraro et al .",
    "if we focus on the region below the bump level ( at the left side of the dashed line in figure  [ f : limag ] ) , there is no systematic difference in li abundances between na - rich ( filled squares ) and na - poor stars ( empty symbols ) .",
    "however , when we look at the diagram as a whole we can see a different drop in the li content with magnitude for the two populations . specifically , while li seems to have a gentle decrease with luminosity for the na - poor stars , the na - rich group presents a very abrupt decline , i.e. , at the bump luminosity li suddenly disappears .",
    "this fact , which reflects different timescales for mixing and hence for li depletion - folding time for li abundance using the tracks by bertelli et al .",
    "na - poor stars reduce to about a factor of 2 their li content in 0.17 mag , which corresponds to @xmath9 10 myr ( this is indeed the time required by a 0.8 @xmath10 star to become brighter by 0.17 magnitudes after it has left the rgb bump ) . for the na - poor stars , this time is smaller by at least an order of magnitude , i.e. @xmath112myr . ] , suggests a structural difference between na - rich and na - poor stars ; however , no current theoretical model predicts such a behavior and we can not provide a satisfactory explanation to date . in this context , we mention that the so - called  thermohaline mixing \" has been proposed responsible for non - canonical mixing acting at the rgb bump ( see , e.g. , eggleton et al . 2007 ; charbonnel & zahn 2007 ) .",
    "eggleton and coworkers suggested that the molecular weight inversion created by the @xmath12he(@xmath12he,2@xmath2)@xmath13he reaction could be the cause of such a mixing : why na - rich and na - poor stars should be differentially affected by this kind of mixing is not obvious and our result could be the input for further theoretical and observational investigations in this direction .    by considering only the stars fainter than the bump luminosity",
    ", we show li abundances as a function of na in figure  [ f : lina ] : as one can see , there is no li@xmath0na anti - correlation , with second generation stars ( [ na / fe]@xmath140.2 dex ) sharing the same li content of the primordial population . as an example , we show in figure  [ f : spec ] the spectra , around the li  i region , for the two most extreme cases in na abundances .",
    "the two stars , with [ na / fe]=@xmath00.02 and [ na / fe]=+0.43 , respectively , show identical li features ( note that the stars have very similar parameters , and the same line strength reflects the same li abundance ) .",
    "the average li abundances are @xmath15=1.336@xmath80.023 ( rms 0.062 ) and @xmath15=1.387@xmath80.038 ( rms 0.136 ) , respectively for na - poor and na - rich stars : although we derive the same li abundance for the two populations , it is interesting to note that na - rich stars have a larger scatter in li with respect to na - poor ones .",
    "a one - tailed fisher test returns a 5% probability such that a difference can be obtained by chance .    _",
    "a natural explanation for this similarity in li content between first and second generation stars ( with the last showing a larger scatter ) is a li production .",
    "_ in fact , if a decrease in o of @xmath150%/60% occurred ( as derived e.g. by marino et al .",
    "2008 and carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) , also li must have been depleted . in a recent work , dantona & ventura ( 2010 )",
    "have presented the expected li production as a function of the polluter mass ( agb stars ) for metallicity @xmath16=0.001 .",
    "looking at their figure 5 , one can see that a very low mass agb polluter ( i.e. , @xmath94  @xmath10 ) can produce a moderate li content with values very close to the li plateau ( @xmath15@xmath12.2 - 2.3 ) . after considering a depletion of a factor of @xmath120 at the 1dup , this result agrees very well with our values ( i.e. @xmath15@xmath11.3 - 1.4 ) . as also briefly explained in the section  [ sec : intro ] ( and widely discussed in carretta et al .",
    "2010 ) , there are further indications that only low - mass polluters could have contributed to the observed chemical pattern in m4 : ( 1 ) an almost  vertical \" na@xmath0o anticorrelation , with very small oxygen variation ( depletion ) ; and ( 2 ) the lack of mg@xmath0al anticorrelation0.10 dex ) of al with na , with na - rich stars also slightly mg depleted ( see their table 7 ) .",
    "evidence for a na@xmath0al correlation was also found by ivans and coworkers . in any case , the al variation is small , and no mg@xmath0al anticorrelation has been observed among m4 stars by ivans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , marino et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and carretta et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "also the mg isotope ratios , as derived by yong et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , show no variation within m4 with values very close to solar ones : the same authors concluded that this is not surprising due to the very little al variation in this gc .",
    "] , which in fact requires high mass polluters for the activation of higher temperature cycles ( @xmath1765  mk ; prantzos & charbonnel 2006 ) .",
    "a similar case could have occurred for ngc  6397 , where according to pasquini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , two stars differ by @xmath10.6 dex in o , but have the same  normal \" li ( @xmath15=2.2 ) . also , in a recent work lind et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , based on a sample of @xmath1100 ms and early sgb / stars , found no difference in li abundances between na - rich and na - poor stars with only two stars driving a li@xmath0na anticorrelation .",
    "they concluded that li content is independent of intra - cluster pollution ; however the na@xmath0o distribution points out to a certain ( though small ) degree of oxygen depletion and , as a consequence , of li destruction as well .",
    "hence , if first and second generation stars share the same li abundances , a li production should also be required for this cluster . along with a difference in metallicity of @xmath10.9 dex ,",
    "the two clusters , ngc  6397 and m  4 , have both quite small integrated magnitudes ( i.e. , mass ) with @xmath18=@xmath06.63 and @xmath18=@xmath07.20 , respectively ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "the similarity in masses between these two gcs also seems to suggest a similar  typical \" polluter for both m4 and ngc  6397 , with the requirement to have in both cases neither very high mass polluters ( no extended mgal / nao anticorrelations , very little he enhancement - capture elements is quite complex . for  extreme \" gcs , like ngc  2808 and @xmath19cen ( with extended nao - mgal anticorrelations , multiple mss and peculiar hb morphology ) the @xmath20 content can reach up to @xmath90.40 . for all the other gcs , even if they show the nao anticorrelations , large differences in @xmath20 are not necessary ( see for details gratton et al .",
    "2010 ) . ] , and no li@xmath0na anticorrelation ) nor low mass polluters ( @xmath114 @xmath10 ) , otherwise the c+n+o is not constant and/or @xmath21-process variations should be present ( see ivans 1999 ; yong et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the more massive gc ngc  6752 ( @xmath18=@xmath07.73 ) could present a different behavior .",
    "we might speculate that only a very low li production from higher mass polluters of @xmath95@xmath06@xmath10 ( see figure 5 of dantona & ventura , 2010 ) does not erase li@xmath0na anticorrelation for this cluster4.5 @xmath10 show a li production close to the plateau values , while in the higher masses regime ( 5@xmath07 @xmath10 ) the li yields become smaller ( a  v - like \" distribution ) . moving to very high - mass stars ( 7 - 8 m@xmath22 ) , the li production reaches extremely high values , up to @xmath15 @xmath94 dex . ] .",
    "note in fact that ngc  6752 presents an extended na@xmath0o anticorrelation and a large variation in al ( i.e. , the mgal chain was active in the polluter stars ) .",
    "on the other hand , it seems very difficult to discriminate the nature of polluters and their properties for 47 tuc : maybe this gc was similar to ngc  6752 but the intrinsic scatter in li abundance , independent of intracluster pollution , washes out the fossil imprint by the previous generation of polluter stars ( dorazi et al .",
    "2010 ) .        given the large uncertainties linked to model predictions ( cross sections , mass loss law , overshooting , convection treatment , etc . ) , here our general aim is to provide a  qualitative \" comparison between theoretical prescriptions by dantona & ventura ( 2009 ) and observational evidence .",
    "also , we stress that our result , based on only a few objects , needs to be confirmed by including a larger number of clusters and of star per cluster .",
    "however , we think that our data provide a quite robust observational evidence of agb stars as responsible for gc pollution",
    ".        = -0.02 and [ na / fe]=+0.43 , respectively .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.),width=340 ]",
    "we report in this letter li abundances for a sample of @xmath1100 giants , both below and above the rgb bump luminosity , belonging to the gc ngc  6121 ( m4 ) .",
    "the main purpose of our work was the study of the correlation ( if any ) between li content and elements involved in @xmath2-capture reactions , the last ones already presented for the very same stars by marino et al .",
    "the principal results we obtained in our investigations can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "as expected , li tends to disappear as the stars reach the rgb bump luminosity ; however the na - rich and na - poor stars show very different trend of li with magnitude . specifically ,",
    "while the decline of na - poor stars with @xmath7 is rather smooth , there is a very brusque decrease for na - rich stars . the so - called  thermohaline mixing \" , which seems responsible for extramixing processes at the rgb bump ,",
    "is not predicted to have different outcomes in na - poor and na - rich stars .",
    "further investigations of this aspect are mandatory both from observational and theoretical points of view .",
    "new observations , focusing on li determination along the rgb in several gcs , are necessary to assess if m4 is a  peculiar \" case or other gcs share the same behavior ; as a consequence model predictions could be revised in this sense .",
    "* m4 does not show any li@xmath0na anticorrelation , with first and second generation stars having almost the same li content .",
    "along with similarities in li abundances , the larger scatter found in na - rich stars , indicates that a li production , from the previous generation of polluters , must have happened .",
    "this provides support to intermediate - mass agb stars responsible for intra - cluster contamination , since frms can only destroy li .",
