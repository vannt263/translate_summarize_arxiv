    "the reduction of exposure to emf is one of the challenging problems in radio access technology ( ran ) that attracts the attention of different stakeholders , from the general public , to telecoms industry and regulatory bodies .",
    "the problem has become even more prominent in face of the frantic race toward the increase of network capacity and optimizing its performance and quality of service ( qos ) @xcite .",
    "in fact the introduction of multiple new technologies in the network goes along with the deployment of several new radiating antenna and transmission towers .",
    "up today , the assessment of rf - emf exposure has been focused separately on the exposure induced by personal devices on the one hand , and that of the network equipment such as base stations ( bss ) and access points on the other hand . in the framework of the fp7 european research project lexnet ,",
    "an exposure metric has been proposed , denoted as the exposure index ( ei ) .",
    "the ei aggregates the exposure from both personal devices and that from bss and access points , giving rise to a single and more realistic network parameter for exposure .",
    "it reflects the contribution to exposure from different technologies and , among others , takes into account the exposure duration from the different radiating sources , the utilized frequencies , environment , services etc .",
    "it is argued that the ei could be used in developing deployment strategies for rans , optimization , self - optimization and management techniques for reducing emf , using a more realistic metric .",
    "recently the issue of reducing the overall and individual level of exposure has been addressed and becomes one of the main concerns from the perspective of the network users . in @xcite for example , a measurement of rf field from wifi access points against a background of rf fields in the environment over the frequency range 75 mhz-3 ghz is performed to quantify the exposure that a bystander might receive from the laptop . in @xcite",
    "the different factors influencing rf exposure in mobile networks are treated in a systematic manner for most relevant wireless standards relying on their rf characteristics .",
    "the most relevant levers for limiting future exposure levels are presented .",
    "nevertheless the risk perception linked to emf exposure from the network users is different .",
    "@xcite illustrates the biased view on rf exposure of network users , who mainly focus on the radiating antennas of telecommunication towers while ignoring or giving little importance to radiation from user equipment close to the body .",
    "however the two sources of radiation are strongly correlated .",
    "leading works in the area of emf exposure reduction consider solutions for uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) transmissions separately . in compliance with the definition of the ei , we address the combined effect of radiation from ul and dl transmissions .",
    "the purpose of this work is to propose a novel self organizing network ( son ) approach for reducing the overall emf exposure , expressed in terms of the ei .",
    "the ei depends on highly complex set of network data and parameters that are too complex to be handled instantly . for this reason",
    ", we adopt the strategy of self - optimizing intermediate key performance indicators ( kpis ) that impact the ei of both ul and dl transmissions . once transmit ( tx ) and received ( rx ) powers",
    "are calculated , emf exposure can be evaluated using transformation tables ( evaluated in @xcite using measurements and electromagnetic simulators ) , and the corresponding ei .",
    "the proposed son algorithm is a load balancing algorithm , based on a stochastic approximations .",
    "it adapts the small cells coverage based on ul loads and on dl qos indicators .",
    "the rationale for the proposed solution is that , to a certain extent , by off - loading macro - cell traffic towards small cells , ul transmission of cell edge users is decreased .",
    "however , above a certain cell range extension , dl qos can be jeopardized , and should be therefore included in the son algorithm .",
    "the contributions of this paper are the following :    * a novel control stochastic load balancing algorithm based on recursive inclusion , which takes into account ul loads and dl qos constraints . * the proof of convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided referring to the developments on stochastic differential inclusions in @xcite . * performance analysis through flow level simulations of the designed mechanism is provided .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : model ] gives the description of the network settings , the problem formulation and the methodology used in the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : flowlevelmetric ] we present the different metrics and flow level kpis .",
    "section  [ sec : sondev ] develops the proposed load - balancing approach to reduce emf exposure .",
    "we evaluate numerically the performances obtained upon activation of the son mechanism in section  [ sec : numanalysis ] and discuss the results .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] eventually concludes the paper .",
    "consider a heterogeneous network(hetnet ) deployment with several operating macro- and small cells ( scs ) located close to the edge of each macro - cell coverage area .",
    "we assume that the scs can be activated whenever additional capacity is needed to serve the traffic in the cell .",
    "all nodes ( macro and scs ) use the same frequency bandwidth .",
    "information can be exchanged between the macro- and small cells in their coverage area using physical or logical links such as the x2 interface in lte .",
    "the system considered in this work matches with lte network requirements for both ul and dl transmissions .",
    "more precisely we are focused on ofdma based transmissions in ul and dl , although it is noted that the proposed methodology can be adapted to other radio access technologies .        in radio access networks ,",
    "emf exposure comprises two components @xcite : ul transmissions from user equipment ( ue ) and dl transmissions from all the bss in the network ( see figure  [ netexposure ] ) . in order to reduce the ei in the network",
    "one can thus seek to minimize a well defined cost function that combines the joint effect of both ul and dl transmissions .",
    "more specifically we focus on reducing the average level of ul tx power from ues to their serving cells as an intermediate metric to reduce ei .",
    "such objective can be achieved by increasing scs coverage , and off - loading macro - cell traffic towards scs .",
    "in fact , off - loading the macro - cell with low power nodes such as scs allows , not only to bring more users to transmit to a closer serving cell with reduced power , but also to a certain extent , to increase the network capacity by off - loading loaded nodes @xcite .",
    "however , as more users are off - loaded to the scs it is likely that we observe a fast decrease of the ul / dl qos .",
    "this is due to a large number of new - interferers ( in ul ) inside the macro - cell coverage area and the additional interference produced by the scs that see their loads increase ( in dl ) .",
    "we propose to formulate the ei reduction problem as a qos constrained optimization problem which we address using an off - loading method relying on scs coverages expansion / contraction . indeed by expanding their coverage , scs can collect more users from the macro - cell relying on the user - to - cell best server attachment criterion @xcite . it is noted that coverage extension is achieved not by increasing the tx power of the scs but rather by increasing / decreasing the value of the cell individual offset ( cio ) used in the network selection / re - selection and handover ( ho ) procedures @xcite . specifically , during idle mode or ho procedures , the mobile compares through a set of measurements the dl received power plus @xmath0 values from each of its neighboring cells .",
    "this is the case for event a3 measurement report triggering @xcite .",
    "then , a ranking of all the available cells including the serving cell is done using the offset ratio of the candidate cells to the serving cell . typically , the selection of cell @xmath1 or ho when user is attached to cell @xmath2 is made if : @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the measured averaged reference signal received power ( rsrps ) , @xmath6 is the hysteresis value and @xmath7 for intra - frequency cell selection . in our particular case ,",
    "the mobile compares the received signal power plus @xmath0 values from the scs to the received signal power from the macro - cell to define its attachment .",
    "the problem thus formulates as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ul load of the macro - cell , @xmath10 the ul load of each small cell in the network , @xmath11 is the optimization vector variable , with element @xmath12 the dl pilot power plus @xmath0 of cell s , @xmath13 are respectively the actual and target dl qos levels .",
    "the problem is combinatorial and depending on the network dynamics a potential solution can stuck at the bounds of the constraint set .",
    "we propose in section [ sec : sondev ] an iterative load - balancing solution to ( [ optimpbm ] ) based on stochastic approximation .",
    "this section presents the network model and the assumptions herein considered .",
    "let @xmath14 be the number of bss ( macro and scs ) within a bounded area @xmath15 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath16 the number of users in cell @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the pathloss ( including antennas gain and shadowing ) between a location @xmath18 and a given bs @xmath2 .",
    "transmissions occur in the ul and we assume that the system operates on a bandwidth @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the number of available resource blocks per bs and @xmath21 the bandwidth in @xmath22 of each prb . a ue at location @xmath23 is assigned a number @xmath24 of resource blocks and transmits with a total power of @xmath25 to bs @xmath2 where @xmath26 is the tx power on resource @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the tx power matrix on the ul .",
    "note that we do not make here any assumption on the way the total tx power of the mobile is split over the allocated sub - bands .",
    "it is discussed in @xcite and @xcite that the achieved gains by subdividing the total power equally over allocated resources is negligible compared to higher complexity of optimal allocation . in the following we thus consider equal distribution of the total tx power over the allocated resources such that @xmath29 .",
    "a closed - form expression of @xmath30 is given by @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the maximum tx power of the ue , @xmath33 is a ue or a cell - specific parameter , @xmath34 is the cell specific pathloss compensation factor , @xmath35 is the dl pathloss measured at the ue , @xmath36 is specified at the ue by the upper - layers and @xmath37 is a ue - specific closed - loop correction value with a relative or absolute increase depending on the function @xmath38 .",
    "a communication is possible between user in @xmath23 and a bs @xmath2 whenever she is in the coverage area @xmath39 of @xmath2 defined by a best server attachment criteria : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined as the dl pilot power of the cell . using this notation , we can write the signal to interference plus noise ratio ( @xmath42 ) for ul transmission , @xmath43 of resource @xmath27 for user in location @xmath23 as : @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the thermal noise spectral power density . here",
    "we consider that @xmath46 when user in @xmath47 from station @xmath48 does not use resource @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath43 is a function of @xmath49 which is omitted in the expression for simplicity .",
    "it is then possible to derive the ul spectral efficiency of user in location @xmath23 as a function of the @xmath42 , @xmath50 bounded by the maximum shannon capacity .",
    "the corresponding rate follows up as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability density function of the ergodic channel fading process that is averaged over each @xmath53 .",
    "it is noted that in ( [ eq : rateup ] ) the user is allocated all the available prbs and hence achieves its peak rate .",
    "we assume here a round robin scheduler , that allocates ( @xmath54 ) prbs when @xmath16 mobiles are present in cell @xmath2 .",
    "the expression of ( [ ultrpower ] ) becomes : @xmath55      the same analysis is done for the dl and we derive the dl @xmath42 and users rates for each cell @xmath2 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the data channel power applied by bs @xmath2 on resource @xmath27 and @xmath35 is the channel gain from bs @xmath2 to location @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the dl tx traffic channel power matrix .",
    "the dl user rate when allocated all resources is given by : @xmath59",

    "consider best effort data traffic with users arriving in the network area at location @xmath23 according to a poisson process with rate @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents an infinitessimal surface element .",
    "users upload a file of exponentially distributed size with mean @xmath62 through their serving bs to the network .",
    "they are also downloading files of mean size @xmath63 . relying on the analysis in @xcite on @xmath64 queue",
    ", we can express the ul ( resp .",
    "dl ) loads of cell @xmath2 , @xmath65 ( resp .",

    "as discussed previously , the ei defined in the scope of the lexnet project , requires as input from the network measurements the mean ul tx and dl rx powers .",
    "the power measurements are aggregated over the periods of users activity , with coefficients which transform power and incident power density into sar ( obtained through measurements and electromagnetic simulations ) @xcite . to assess the mean overall ul and dl radiated power in the network , we define the tx power density @xmath73 per surface element @xmath61 . from the power density , we obtain exposure density in term of sar by the linear transformation @xmath74 , namely @xmath75 . @xmath76 can be regarded as a linear function which weights the measured power with the sar reference value corresponding to the usage . in compliance to the ei definition",
    ", we obtain the mean overall ul exposure level metric as : @xmath77 and similarly , the mean overall dl exposure level is given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the time spent by a user in @xmath23 in the network and @xmath80 is a factor taking into account exposure during users inactivities .",
    "it is estimated in @xcite that adult users are active ( namely in communication ) @xmath81 of the time ( @xmath82 ) but are passively exposed to dl emf the rest of the day .",
    "note that the discrete versions of expressions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are nothing but the exposure factor defined in @xcite .",
    "this factor is the ei term for a specific radio access technology while ignoring the other terms which are not impacted by the self - optimization .",
    "the optimization under qos constraint of emf exposure reduction stated in ( [ optimpbm ] ) is addressed in this section as a self - optimization problem . in the following",
    "we consider the cell outage as the dl qos constraint and assume that it is increasing with the load .",
    "the latter also increases with the cell coverage and hence with @xmath85 , where the macro has the subscript @xmath86 and is not self - optimized . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we interchangeably use @xmath87 and @xmath88 for simplicity of notations .",
    "we define the cell outage at an instant @xmath89 as the probability that a given user experience a @xmath42 smaller than a predefined threshold @xmath90 .",
    "equivalently , the outage is the proportion of active users that experience a smaller @xmath42 than this threshold .",
    "a closed form expression of the outage probability in mobile networks is proposed in @xcite . in order to find a solution for ( [ optimpbm ] ) and",
    "given the dl outage constraint , we design as in @xcite an iterative stochastic load - balancing algorithm as follows : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a vector of length @xmath93 of components @xmath94 : @xmath95 note that @xmath96 is a discontinuous upper semi - continuous function taking values in the compact convex set @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "the motivation for the definition ( [ eq : costfunc ] ) of @xmath96 is to try to balance the macro- and small cells loads as long as outage is low .",
    "hence when @xmath98 the dynamic is driven by the load - balancing objective and the scs increase their coverages to absorb more ul traffic from the macro station .",
    "on the other hand when the condition @xmath99 holds , the dynamics goes toward the fulfillment of the constraint namely to remain in the constraint set for the outage .",
    "we assume that the macro - cell broadcasts regularly its load to the scs while the outage threshold is introduced by the operator via the management plane . to conduct the convergence analysis of ( [ iterativeeq ] )",
    "we need the following proposition :    the recursive stochastic iteration ( [ iterativeeq ] ) is a particular case of the recursive stochastic inclusion @xmath100 where @xmath101 with @xmath102 and for a given set @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the closed convex hull of the set @xmath103 .",

    "the latter reduces macro - cell interference produced on users at the extended coverage area of the scs by muting a portion of the macro station transmissions .",
    "this mechanisms is adopted in the present work .      in an initial set of simulations ,",
    "we increase scs coverage using the cio .",
    "the objective here is to highlight the relation between the cio parameter and qos , overall radiate power and ei . in figures  [ uldlmeanexpoincio]-[dlmeanoutageinccio ] and [ sonoutage ] , the upper 3 curves corresponds to the macro - cell while the lower ones - to the scs .",
    "we start with the baseline setting when scs do not expand their coverage . in this setting",
    ", we observe that most of the arriving users are connected to the macro - cell since it offers a better received signal .",
    "however in the ul , due to high path - losses , many macro - cells users transmit with a high power . in figure  [ ultxpwinccio ]",
    "we plot the empirical complementary cumulative distribution of the users ul tx power .",
    "the upper curve represents the distribution of power for the first applied value of @xmath112 .",
    "this is indeed the case where the overall ul tx power is the highest which results in the highest level of the exposure .",
    "note that for each curve ( in figure  [ ultxpwinccio ] ) the upper part is representative of a lower tx power from the scs users compared to macro users tx power , which contribute more in the lower part .",
    "now we start increasing the coverage of scs .",
    "when scs coverages are small , there are very few users that are off - loaded while the macro remains highly loaded ( the scenario considers a high load regime ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the cell outage is very high at the macro while it remains low at the scs .",
    "however as the scs coverage expands , their users experience growing interference . in parallel , with the increase of cio , sc users in the extended coverage area will increase their tx power .",
    "due to these two combined factors , the ul ftt at the scs thus increases as shown in figure  [ ulfttinccio ] .",
    "interestingly this increase remains low enough to observe a good trade - off compared to the important decrease in ul tx power .",
    "this is what we observe in figure  [ uldlmeanexpoincio ] for the ul exposure which decreases despite the light interference impairments .",
    "one can also see that the dl has a limited contribution to overall exposure .",
    "again as we noted in figure  [ ultxpwinccio ] , the macro users ul tx power is decreasing since they are being closer to their serving cells . as a result scs users perceive less interference from the macro users which contributes to the aforementioned interference impairments .",
    "the evolution of the load as a function of cio is shown in figure  [ uldlloadinccio ] . in",
    "the dl users accumulate at the scs nodes while they depart fast from the macro as they are fewer , and are served with fixed dl power .",
    "one can see that the macro - cell load decreases with the increase in cio , and remain significantly higher than the scs loads .",
    "a similar trend is observed in figure  [ dlmeanoutageinccio ] for the outage .",
    "one can see that the mean outage decreases at the macro - cell and grows at scs nodes for high cio values until they are overloaded and can barely maintain an acceptable qos .",
    "it is noted that not all scs benefit from coverage increase , thus motivating the use of a self - optimization .      under the same setting as before we now activate the distributed self - optimizing algorithm in the scs with a target outage of @xmath81 and a threshold rate of @xmath113 . in figure  [ pilotecioadpt ]",
    "we plot the evolution of pilot power plus @xmath0 as a function of the algorithm iterations ( 6s per iteration ) .",
    "we observe that the @xmath0 does not systematically grow to its upper limit of @xmath114 and adapts to the qos constraint according to the traffic in each sc .",
    "note that the pilot powers from the macro - cells are kept constant as they are not concerned with the coverage expansion .",
    "in figure  [ sonoutage ] we can see that the outage barely grows above the defined limit and is indeed monitored and controlled by the autonomous mechanism .",
    "we define the exposure gain as the relative exposure reduction with respect to the base line scenario . a reduction in exposure",
    "is translated into a positive gain , and vise versa .",
    "figures  [ gainulexposure ] , [ gaindlexposure ] and [ gainmeanexposure ] show the main result of the numerical analysis , namely the exposure gain for the ul , dl and the total ( i.e. ul and dl combined ) ei , respectively , brought about by the self - optimizing algorithm .",
    "the combined ul and dl average exposure gain for the macro - cells is around @xmath115 percent ( see figure [ gainmeanexposure ] ) , which is similar to that in the ul ( see figure [ gainulexposure ] ) . in the dl , a relative exposure increase varying between 10 and",
    "20 percent can be observed ( see lower curve in figure [ gaindlexposure ] ) , which is accompanied by an increasing outage of dl users at the scs .",
    "it is recalled that the outage level is controlled by the self - optimizing algorithm .",

    "with the objective of reducing the overall exposure to emf in mobile networks this work has addressed the assessment and reduction of rf exposure relying on macro - cells off - loading with scs nodes . using the definition of the ei provided by the european fp7 lexnet project , which considers the combined effect of ul and dl transmissions , we have modeled the problem as a distributed optimization of ul kpis under the constraint of dl qos .",
    "this is one of the main output of this work where we show and utilize the strong correlation between ul performances improvement and dl qos degradation when dealing with the reduction of the ei .",
    "we have designed a controlled stochastic load - balancing mechanism to perform an iterative reduction of the defined exposure cost function for which the algorithm has been proved to converge .",
    "the results of this study lead naturally to several directions of future investigations .",
