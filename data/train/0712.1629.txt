    "the third catalog of @xmath0-ray agns detected by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ includes @xmath2 80 high - confidence identifications of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an alternative method is to assume some correlation between @xmath0-ray emission and the emission in other bands to model the undetected @xmath0-ray blazars , in which the larger samples in other bands provide useful clues to such researches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "comptonization is widely believed to be responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission from the blazars detected by egret , which can be classified into two categories : the ec models and ssc model , according to the origin of the soft seed photons ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review and references therein ) .",
    "the space density and evolution of the parent population of blazars , together with the lorentz factor distribution of the jets , are crucial for understanding the properties of @xmath0-ray emitting blazars . in almost all previous works ,",
    "the models of blazars are rather simplified . in this _ letter _",
    ", we derive the parent radio lf of radio quasars / fr iis from the fsrq lf to investigate the statistic properties of @xmath0-ray emitting quasars to be detected by glast .",

    "the energy distribution of the nonthermal electrons in the jet is assumed to be @xmath16 .    in the ec models ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was argued that the contribution from the accretion disks is not important , because the @xmath0-ray emitting region is far away from the disk and in the jet comoving frame , the energy density of photons from the disk is deboosted by the relativistic jet moving away from the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite derived the radio lfs of fsrqs and fr ii galaxies from a sample of radio - loud agns .",
    "they considered a two - component model , in which the total luminosity @xmath34 is the sum of an unbeamed part @xmath35 and a jet luminosity @xmath36 they used a variety of observational features to constrain the ratio @xmath37(@xmath38 ) .",
    "they found that a constant @xmath39 can successfully explain the observations ( see * ? ? ? * for the details ) .",

    "our calculations show that no fr ii radio galaxies will be detected by glast as @xmath0-ray emitters either for ec or ssc models .",
    "we find that almost all @xmath0-ray quasars ( @xmath299% ) to be detected by glast will be fsrqs for the ec model , and the remainder ( @xmath21% ) will be ssrqs .",

    "we find that the redshifts of almost all egret bl lac objects are @xmath86 , which implies that bl lac objects may have different space density and evolutionary behaviors from quasars .",
    "the lf of bl lac objects was derived from the dxrbs by @xcite , however , the results for bl lac objects are more uncertain than those for fsrqs , because of the small number statistics and @xmath230% of them having no redshift . in this work",
    ", we use a parent radio lf of radio quasars / fr ii galaxies derived from the fsrq lf .",
    "the derived redshift distributions of @xmath0-ray quasars are similar for different models ( ec or ssc ) , which are roughly consistent with that of the egret quasars .",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath0-ray radiative mechanisms are different for quasars and bl lac objects , i.e. , the ec mechanism may be responsible for quasars , while the ssc is for bl lac objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". if the ec mechanism is indeed responsible for @xmath0-ray quasars , the predicted @xmath0-ray quasars to be detected by glast will be @xmath1 .",
    "our results are roughly consistent with the estimate given by @xcite based on a simplified blazar model .",
    "the ssc model predicts a simple relation between @xmath0-ray luminosity and radio luminosity of the jets ( see eq .",
    "[ l_sscrad ] ) . the egret flux limit @xmath87 at 100  mev can be converted to a radio flux density limit @xmath88  jy at 5ghz by using eq . ( [ l_sscrad ] ) .",
    "this means that all egret quasars should have their radio flux densities higher than @xmath89 jy , which is obviously inconsistent with most egret quasars having @xmath90  jy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the ssc model is unlikely to be responsible for egret quasars , unless the physical properties of the jets are significantly different for individual sources , i.e. , the values of @xmath81 for most sources deviate significantly from a constant value .",
    "our results show that no fr ii galaxies will be detected by glast .",
    "most glast quasars will be fsrqs ( @xmath299% for the ec model ) , which implies that fsrqs will still be good candidates for identifying the @xmath0-ray sources even for the glast sources .",
    "at least two fr i galaxies have been detected by egret ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more fr i galaxies were predicted to be detected by glast ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the unification scheme , fr i galaxies are bl lac objects with misaligned jets .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fr i galaxies / bl lac objects are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the egret quasars identified at high confidence ( 64 sources ) have radio flux densities @xmath91  jy and are about 20% of the total fsrqs ( @xmath92 ) above the same flux density limit ( see fig .",
    "6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . assuming the radio flux density limit of the glast quasars to be @xmath93 times lower than the egret limit , i.e. , @xmath93  mjy , the total all - sky number of the fsrqs above this limit is about @xmath94 .",
    "so , about 4000 fsrqs will be detected by glast , if the same percentage ( @xmath95% ) is adopted as the egret blazars .",
    "this rough estimate is about a factor of two higher than our model calculations . considering that some unidentified @xmath0-ray sources are likely to be blazars , our estimates on @xmath0-ray quasars to be detected by glast are only lower limits .",
    "both the duty cycle in the @xmath0-ray band and identification rate may affect the detection rate , and we implicitly assume them to be similar to those of egret blazars .",
    "the egrb integrated above 100 mev was determined to be @xmath96 photons",
    "@xmath75  s@xmath77  sr@xmath77 from the egret data @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a new model of the galactic background , and obtained a slightly smaller value of the egrb , @xmath97 photons @xmath75  s@xmath77  sr@xmath77 .",
    "we sum up the @xmath0-ray emission from all radio quasars / fr iis with our derived @xmath0-ray lf and find that they contribute @xmath230% of the egrb ( see table 1 ) , which are only lower limits , because our calculations are limited to radio quasars / fr ii galaxies .",
