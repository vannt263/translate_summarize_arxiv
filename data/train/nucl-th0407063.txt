    "the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is also strongly attractive , as derived from the strong - interaction shifts and widths in kaonic - atom levels across the periodic table @xcite .",
    "it is not established yet how strong the @xmath0-nucleus potential is : ` deep ' ( 150 - 200 mev @xcite ) or relatively ` shallow ' ( 50 - 60 mev @xcite ) ? is it possible to bind _ strongly _ @xmath0 mesons in nuclei and are such potentially deep bound states sufficiently narrow to allow observation and identification ? these issues have received considerable phenomenological and theoretical attention recently @xcite , and some experimental evidence for candidate states in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions on @xmath11he ( kek - ps e471 , @xcite respectively ) and in the @xmath12 in - flight reaction on @xmath4o ( bnl - ags , parasite e930 @xcite ) has been presented very recently .",
    "new experiments have been approved at kek , using @xmath13 reactions to search for @xmath0 nuclear bound states @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 reactions @xcite were also suggested in this context .",
    "a prime concern in searching for @xmath0 nuclear bound states is the anticipated large width due to pionic conversion modes on a single nucleon : @xmath15 with thresholds about 100 mev and 180 mev , respectively , below the @xmath16 total mass , and also due to non - pionic multi - nucleon absorption modes , say @xmath17 with thresholds about @xmath18 mev lower than the single - nucleon thresholds .",
    "the branching ratios in parentheses are known from bubble - chamber experiments @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study _ dynamical _ effects for @xmath0 nuclear states in the range of binding energy @xmath19 mev @xcite and in particular the width anticipated for such deeply bound states .",
    "the relatively shallow chirally - motivated @xmath0-nucleus potentials @xcite which followed the microscopic construction by ramos and oset @xcite are of no use in this context , since they can not yield binding energy greater than the potential depth of about 50 mev .",
    "one must therefore depart from the microscopic approach in favor of a more phenomenologically inclined model which is constrained by data other than two - body @xmath6 observables .",
    "the theoretical framework here adopted is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model for a system of nucleons and one @xmath0 meson interacting through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath20 ) and vector ( @xmath21 ) boson fields which are treated in the mean - field approximation . by allowing the @xmath0 to polarize the nucleons , and vice versa , this dynamical calculation is made self consistent .",
    "@xmath0 absorption modes are included within a @xmath22 optical - model approach , where the density @xmath23 plays a dynamical role , and the constant @xmath24 which is constrained near threshold by @xmath2-atom data follows the phase - space reduction in reactions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conv1],[eq : conv2 ] ) for a deeply bound @xmath0 . a wide range of binding energies may be explored in the rmf calculation simply by scanning over the coupling constants of the @xmath0 meson to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 boson fields .",
    "detailed calculations were done by us across the periodic table . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate the essential points and conclusions for @xmath3c and @xmath4o where the dynamical polarization effects are extremely important for the energies of the @xmath0 bound states as well as for their widths .",
    "akaishi et al .",
    "@xcite too have found large polarization effects in lighter nuclei using few - body variational techniques . the rmf is a systematic approach used across the periodic table beyond the very light elements explored by other techniques , and it can be used also to study multi-@xmath0 configurations and to explore the @xmath0 condensation limit @xcite .",
    "similar rmf calculations have been recently reported for @xmath25 states in nuclei @xcite .",
    "in the calculations described below , the standard rmf lagrangian @xmath26 with the linear ( l ) parameterization of horowitz and serot @xcite as well as the nonlinear ( nl ) parameterization due to sharma et al .",
    "@xcite are used for the description of the nucleonic sector .",
    "the ( anti)kaon interaction with the nuclear medium is incorporated by adding to @xmath26 the lagrangian density @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28 the covariant derivative @xmath29 describes the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the vector meson @xmath21 .",
    "the vector field @xmath21 is then associated with a conserved current .",
    "the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the isovector @xmath23 meson is here excluded due to considering @xmath30 nuclear cores in this initial report .    whereas adding @xmath31 to the original lagrangian @xmath26 does not affect the form of the corresponding dirac equation for nucleons , the presence of @xmath0 leads to additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson fields @xmath20 and @xmath32 to which the @xmath0 couples : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath0 energy in the nuclear medium : @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the nuclear scalar and vector densities , respectively . adding @xmath0 to the nuclear system",
    "affects the scalar and vector potentials which enter the dirac equation for nucleons .",
    "this leads to the rearrangement , or polarization of the nuclear core in the presence of @xmath0 .    in order to preserve the connection to previous studies of kaonic atoms , the klein gordon ( kg ) equation of motion for the @xmath0",

    "the real part of the @xmath0 optical potential @xmath43 is then given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the scalar and vector potentials due to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean fields , respectively .",
    "since the rmf approach does not address the imaginary part of the potential , @xmath47 was taken in a phenomenological @xmath22 form , where its depth was fitted to the @xmath2 atomic data @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath23 in the present calculations is no longer a static nuclear density , but is a _ dynamical _ entity affected by the @xmath0 interacting with the nucleons via boson fields .",
    "the resulting compressed nuclear density leads to increased widths , particularly for deeply bound states . on the other hand , the phase space available for the decay products",
    "is reduced for deeply bound states , which will act to decrease the calculated widths .",
    "thus , suppression factors multiplying @xmath47 were introduced from phase - space considerations , taking into account the binding energy of the kaon for the initial decaying state , and assuming two - body final - state kinematics for the decay products .",

    "although multi - nucleon absorption modes are often modeled to have a power - law @xmath55 ( @xmath56 @xmath57 1 ) density dependence , our comprehensive @xmath2-atom fits @xcite are satisfied with @xmath58 . we therefore assume @xmath59 in this exploratory work also for this second absorption channel , , is due to koltun @xcite ] which means that @xmath60 too is independent of density .",
    "we comment below on the effect of a possible density dependence of @xmath60 , reflecting perhaps a @xmath61 dependence of the non - pionic decay mode ( [ eq : conv2 ] ) at high densities .",
    "since @xmath62 final states dominate these channels @xcite the hyperon @xmath63 was here taken as @xmath64 . allowing @xmath65 hyperons would foremost _ add _ conversion width to @xmath0 states bound in the region @xmath66 mev .",
    "for the combined suppression factor we assumed a mixture of 80% mesonic decay and 20% nonmesonic decay @xcite , i.e. @xmath67 this suppression factor is plotted as function of @xmath68 in the upper part of fig .",

    "( [ eq : sigma],[eq : omega ] ) above , as well as the kg equation ( [ eq : kg1 ] ) for @xmath2 were solved self - consistently using an iterative procedure . obviously , the requirement of self - consistency is crucial for the proper evaluation of the dynamical effects of the @xmath0 on the nuclear core and vice versa .",
    "we note that self - consistency is not imposed here on the final - state hadrons which only enter through their _ on - shell _",
    "masses used in the phase - space suppression factors given above . for the main @xmath72 decay channel it is likely that the attraction provided by the pion within a dynamical calculation @xcite is largely cancelled by the nuclear repulsion deduced phenomenologically for @xmath62 hyperons @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present calculations of @xmath0-nucleus bound states was to establish correlations between various observables such as the @xmath0 binding energy , width and macroscopic nuclear properties .",
    "in particular we aimed at covering a wide range of binding energies in order to evaluate widths of possible strongly bound @xmath0 states .",
    "furthermore , in order to study effects of the nuclear polarization , we calculated rms radii and average densities of the nuclei involved and , in some cases , also single particle energies .",
    "extensive calculations were made for @xmath3c and @xmath4o , nuclei that had been discussed earlier in the context of strongly bound @xmath0 states @xcite .",
    "additionally , more restricted calculations were made for @xmath73ca and @xmath74pb .    in a preliminary test we performed dynamical calculations for @xmath2 _ atomic _ @xmath75 states , which produced only negligibly small polarization effects , thus validating previous analyses of kaonic atom data .",
    "the empirical values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , as found from a fit to kaonic atom data @xcite , were therefore used as a starting point for calculations .",
    "a full dynamical calculation was then made for @xmath2 _ nuclear _ states starting from the @xmath22 imaginary potential obtained from the atomic fit , while entering dynamically in the iteration cycles the resulting nuclear density and the suppression factor @xmath78 as defined by eq.([eq : spf ] ) .",
    "dynamical _ calculation nearly doubled , for the light nuclei here considered , the depth of the real part of the phenomenological _ static _",
    "@xmath2-nucleus potential of ref .",
    "@xcite which is of the ` deep ' variety , typically 150 - 200 mev deep in the static calculation .    since there is no preferred way of varying the depth of the real @xmath2-nucleus potential in order to produce different values of binding energies , we used two methods for scanning over binding energies .",
    "the first one , referred to below as the ` rmf ' method , was to scale down successively @xmath79 from its initial value @xmath76 and , once it reached zero , to scale down @xmath80 too from its initial value @xmath77 until the @xmath2 @xmath75 state became unbound .",
    "as an alternative method we chose as a starting point values @xmath81 and @xmath82 obtained from fits to kaonic atom data where the rmf - based real potential was joined at large radii by a @xmath83 expression , using for @xmath24 the chiral @xmath1 amplitudes of ramos and oset @xcite .",
    "this starting potential was of the ` shallow ' variety @xcite , about 55 mev deep in the static calculation .",
    "it is gratifying that the replacement of the chiral @xmath83 expression within the nucleus by the rmf model did not change the resulting @xmath0-nuclear potential depth .",
    "we then increased the potential depth by scaling up @xmath79 from its initial value @xmath81 , in order to achieve as deep binding as in the first set of calculations , while keeping @xmath80 constant at its initial value @xmath82 .",
    "this second method will be referred to below as the ` chiral tail ' method .",
    "note that in both methods ( @xmath84 ) the starting values ( @xmath85 ) correspond to potentials that produce in the dynamical calculation good fits to the @xmath2 atomic data , although re @xmath86 have vastly different depths .",
    "the good fits to the atomic data are inevitably lost once the coupling constants ( @xmath79 in the procedure outlined above ) are allowed to vary in order to scan over a wide range of binding energies and the associated widths .",
    "figure [ fig : gamma ] shows , in its middle and lower parts , calculated widths @xmath87 as function of the binding energy @xmath88 for @xmath75 states in @xmath89o and @xmath90c , respectively .",
    "open squares and solid circles are for the l and nl versions of the rmf model , respectively , both calculated using the ` rmf ' method for scanning the binding energies .",
    "the crosses are for rmf - l , using the ` chiral tail ' method for scanning the binding energies .",
    "it is clearly seen that the widths of the @xmath2 nuclear state follow closely the dependence of the suppression factor on the binding energy and that , except for binding energies smaller than 50 mev , the dependence of the width on the binding energy follows , for a given nucleus , almost a universal curve .",
    "we note that the widths calculated in the range @xmath91 mev assume values @xmath92 mev , which are considerably larger than what the suppression factor of the upper part of the figure would suggest .",
    "this is largely related to the dynamical nature of the rmf calculation whereby the nuclear density is increased by the polarization effect of the @xmath2 , as shown in the next figures .",
    "furthermore , replacing @xmath23 by @xmath61 for the density dependence of the non - pionic decay modes ( [ eq : conv2 ] ) is estimated to increase the above values of the width by 10 - 15 mev .",
    "this estimate follows , again , from the increase of nuclear density with @xmath68 noticed above .",
    "switching on the @xmath93 decay mode would increase further this estimate by 5 - 10 mev in the range @xmath94 mev .",
    "we assert that the estimate @xmath95 mev in the range @xmath91 mev provides a reasonable lower bound on the width expected in any realistic calculation .",
    "a more detailed systematics is defered to a subsequent regular report .",
    "figures [ fig : nuclc ] and [ fig : nuclo ] exhibit various nuclear properties for @xmath75 states in @xmath90c and @xmath89o , respectively . the top and middle parts show the calculated average nuclear density @xmath96 and the nuclear rms radius , respectively , and the lower parts show the @xmath75 and @xmath97 neutron single - particle energies @xmath98 .",
    "the differences between the linear and non - linear models reflect the different nuclear compressibility and the somewhat different nuclear sizes obtained in the two models .",
    "again , for @xmath2 binding energy greater than 50 mev the results are independent of the way the binding energy is being scanned .",
    "it is interesting to note that the increase in the nuclear rms radius of @xmath89o for large values of @xmath88 is the result of the reduced binding energy of the @xmath99 state , due to the increased spin - orbit term .",
    "note also that as @xmath88 approaches zero we do _ not _ recover the values inherent in static calculations for the various nuclear entities because the coupling constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the imaginary part of the potential , still assume nonzero values .",
    "the substantial increase of @xmath100 , the decrease of the nuclear rms radius , and the decrease of the @xmath75 neutron single - particle energy , all point out to a significant polarization of the nuclear core by the @xmath75 @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we note that in similar calculations for @xmath73ca and @xmath74pb the widths of the @xmath2 nuclear state _ vs. _ its binding energy turned out to be similar in shape to the corresponding results for @xmath3c and @xmath4o , but the effects on the average density and the rms radius are negligibly small , as expected for heavier nuclei .",
    "table [ tab : tabl1 ] shows several examples of the excited - state spectrum of @xmath2-nuclear states in the core of @xmath4o .",
    "the calculated widths of the excited states appear to follow the general trend of widths for @xmath75 states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "the polarization of the nucleus as judged by the value of its average density @xmath101 appears to diminish , the higher the @xmath2 state is , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclo ] .",
    "we note the fairly large spacing between neighboring states : the effective @xmath102 is of order 100 mev for the first spectrum , decreasing to 80 mev and to 70 mev in the second and third spectra , respectively , as the @xmath75 binding is made lower .",
    "static calculations give smaller spacings .",
    "kishimoto et al .",
    "@xcite have very recently suggested evidence from the measured neutron spectrum in the @xmath103 reaction for a peak at @xmath104 mev which they interpreted as the @xmath97 @xmath0 state , probably since a hint for a peak at @xmath105 mev is also suggested by the same spectrum .",
    "the results shown in table [ tab : tabl1 ] rule out such interpretation which would require @xmath106 mev , considerably less than our _ dynamical _ calculations produce . if the peak at @xmath104 mev were a @xmath97 state , one should have expected the @xmath75 state to be deeply bound , at @xmath107 mev where no signal has been observed . on the other hand , if this peak is a @xmath75 state , then the relatively shallow @xmath97 state would be expected too broad to be distinguished in the data .",
    "binding energies and widths of deeply bound @xmath2 nuclear states in @xmath3c and @xmath4o were calculated with the aim of establishing values of widths that could be expected for binding energies in the range of 100 - 200 mev .",
    "the method chosen was to couple the @xmath2 dynamically to the nucleus within the rmf approach , which is applicable throughout the periodic table , but which is disconnected from near - threshold @xmath1 phenomenology .",
    "negligible polarization effects were found for _ atomic _ states , which confirms the optical - potential phenomenology of kaonic atoms as a valid starting point for the present study .",
    "substantial polarization of the core nucleus was found in these light nuclei for deeply bound @xmath0 nuclear states .",
    "almost universal dependence of antikaon widths on its binding energy was found , for a given nucleus , suggesting that the details of how the calculated binding energy is varied over the desired range of values is largely immaterial .",
    "the widths are mostly determined by the phase - space suppression factors on top of the increase provided by the density of the compressed nuclei .",
    "the present results already provide useful guidance for the interpretation of recent experimental results @xcite by placing a lower limit @xmath108 mev on @xmath0 states in @xmath4o bound in the range @xmath91 mev . for lighter nuclear targets such as @xmath11he , where the rmf approach becomes unreliable but where nuclear polarization effects are found larger using few - body calculational methods @xcite , we anticipate larger widths for @xmath0 deeply bound states , if such states do exist @xcite . this work was supported in part by the ga avcr grant iaa1048305 and by the israel science foundation grant 131/01 .                                                        .@xmath109 bound - state spectra in @xmath110 calculated for several rmf ( nl ) lagrangians specified by different coupling - constant ratios @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
