    "expansion rates increase inward by about 60%  along the bright se - nw axis , ranging from @xmath21%  yr@xmath1 for the outer ears to @xmath22%  yr@xmath1 for the inner rims .",
    "the bright rims in the middle expand slightly faster ( @xmath23%  yr@xmath1 ) than the ears , but even this small difference is statistically highly significant .",
    "the brightness - weighted linear displacement is @xmath24 yr@xmath1 for all three rims .",
    "s expansion is intermediate ( @xmath25%  yr@xmath1 ) between the bright middle rims and the ears , with the average displacement of @xmath26 yr@xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate this differential expansion for two representative profiles in se and nw based on the epoch ii observations ( figures [ eastprofile ] and [ westprofile ] ) .",
    "as is seen most clearly in the close - up inserts , the expansion rate ( green ) that matches the bright middle rims is too slow ( too little shrinkage ) for the inner rims , while the faster expansion rate ( red ) that matches the inner rims is too fast for the middle and outer rims .",
    "contributions to c - statistic along the profiles quantify the fit quality .",
    "systematic deviations are present even for the best - fit models , perhaps due to spatial variation of the _ chandra _ point - spread function , smaller - scale spatial variations in expansion rate , or projection effects .",
    "strong counting noise limits the accuracy of the expansion measurements .",
    "however , these profiles are merely illustrative ; the results in table 1 are derived from the expansion of the entire regions shown in figure [ 2xim ] .",
    "the spatially - integrated spectra of from each epoch were jointly fit , together with their background spectra , with an absorbed power law in the 1  9 kev energy range .",
    "the power - law index and absorbing column density were assumed constant in time , but the fluxes at each epoch were left free .",
    "there is good agreement with previous measurements for epoch i , but the newly - determined epoch ii flux is 2.5%  larger , in disagreement with the previous measurement also reported in paper v , presumably due to updates in the acis s3 calibration that were applied to all three datasets .",
    "spatially - integrated fluxes are clearly increasing with time ( table [ expansionfluxrates ] ) .",
    "a likelihood ratio test reveals that the linear flux increase is consistent with the individual flux measurements .",
    "the measured flux increase is @xmath3%  yr@xmath1 , in agreement with the previous , less accurate value of @xmath27 yr@xmath1 ( paper v ) .",
    "we also measured fluxes and rates of flux increase for the region pairs shown in figure [ 2xim ] , in the same way as for the spatially - integrated fluxes except that the background contribution was scaled down ( rather than fit again ) by the region / total area ratios from the global fit . for each region pair , the measured rate of flux increase is consistent with the spatially - integrated rate .",
    "there is an apparent trend in brightening rate with radius , but uncertainties are large , due to uncertainties in expanding the regions and to dust scattering of emission from brighter regions ( paper iii ) , as well as to large measurement errors . we conclude that evidence for spatial variations in the rate of flux increase is weak , although it should be the subject of future investigations .",
    "the nonuniform expansion we observe for our three pairs of regions can be rephrased as large differences in expansion age ( @xmath28 ) , in the sense that @xmath29 is largest ( greatest deceleration ) for the slower - expanding outermost material ( see figure [ 2xim ] and table [ expansionfluxrates ] ) .",
    "the outermost ears , bright rim emission in the middle , and distinct interior rims all have measurably different expansion ages : 190 yr , 160 yr , and 120 yr . we define expansion indices @xmath30 so that a feature at radius @xmath31 obeys @xmath32 ( note that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the projection of the true radius @xmath31 onto the plane of the sky ) .",
    "then the true remnant age @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the forward - shock expansion index .",
    "since we only have an estimate of 100 yr for the true remnant age ( paper v ) , we can only determine relative @xmath4 values .",
    "the large spread in expansion ages between the inner rims and the ears implies a large deceleration of the forward shock , @xmath37 , significantly stronger than expected ( @xmath38 ) in the models with smoothly varying density distributions for ejecta and ambient medium considered in paper v. but the more fundamental problem is that , contrary to observations , @xmath4 in these models typically varies only slightly ( if at all ) from the reverse shock to the blast wave , and it increases instead of decreasing with radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dc98 ) . either the ejecta or the ambient medium density distribution ( or both ) must be very different from the slowly - varying density distributions considered so far .",
    "various possibilities include substantial clumping or sudden density jumps within the ejecta or the ambient medium .",
    "fine - scale clumping within the ejecta is unlikely to explain faster than expected expansion of the inner rims , however .",
    "much like the outer rims , the inner rims consist of cohesive and continuous filaments in contrast to the much more clumpy north rim ( figure [ 2xim ] ) where the ejecta emit most strongly in thermal x - rays ( paper vi ) .",
    "another explanation involves a rapid deceleration of the blast wave upon a recent encounter with a moderate density jump in the ambient medium . in order to account for about 60%  ",
    "70%  slower expansion of the middle and outer rims relative to the inner rims ( table [ expansionfluxrates ] ) , a factor of 3  6 density jump is required ( from eqs .  4 and 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "a density jump of this magnitude is consistent with a wind termination shock . if this were true , the sn progenitor must have been losing mass in a strong and asymmetric stellar wind .",
    "we estimate the wind parameter ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath41 is the wind speed ) at @xmath42 km s@xmath1 , using the analytic wind thin - shell solution for an exponential ejecta density distribution from paper v with the remnant s radius of 2 pc and undecelerated age of 120 yr , and assuming a standard thermonuclear explosion with kinetic energy @xmath43 ergs and ejected mass equal to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "such a strong wind favors a single - degenerate progenitor @xcite .",
    "the deceleration is @xmath44 in this model , suggesting that the explosion occurred sometime in the first decade of the 20th century . in this scenario , it is difficult to understand the origin of the strong north - south asymmetry seen at radio wavelengths ( figure [ 2xim ] ) and in the spatial distribution of thermal x - ray emission . as discussed in paper vi , a strongly asymmetric type ia explosion provides the best explanation for this asymmetry .",
    "unlike for smooth ejecta density profiles ( such as resulting from delayed - detonation explosions ) , it is possible to obtain less deceleration inward ( @xmath45 ) in 1-d numerical models for sne ia expanding into a uniform ambient medium for ejecta profiles with substantial structure ( e.g. , the pdde model in * ? ? ?",
    "prominent density structures in the outer ejecta layers are present in the deflagration models ( e.g. , the w7 model of @xcite ) , sub - chandrasekhar explosions ( dc98 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in pulsating delayed - detonation ( pdd ) models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see their pddel1 model plotted in figure [ hydro ] ) .",
    "this density profile can be satisfactorily approximated by a power law @xmath46 with @xmath47 above the transition velocity @xmath48 km s@xmath1 , and by the exponential model of dc98 at lower velocities . at @xmath49",
    ", there is a large ( @xmath50 ) density jump .    in order to investigate how a density jump affects speeds of the reverse and forward shocks",
    ", we performed 1-d hydrodynamical simulations with the vh-1 hydrocode ( for a recent description of this code , see * ? ? ? * ) for this composite power - law - exponential ejecta model , we discuss here results for a preshock density @xmath51 of @xmath52 @xmath9 , matching the preshock density found in a young type ia in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , but they can be scaled to any value of @xmath51 ( dc98 ) . prior to the impact of the reverse shock with the density jump , the density profile can be described by the self - similar solutions of @xcite with @xmath53 ( see the density profile at 50 yr in figure [ hydro ] )",
    ". the reverse shock arrives at the density jump at @xmath54 yr with velocity @xmath55 ( in the frame of reference moving with the ejecta ) , and then splits into transmitted and reflected shocks .",
    "the transmitted shock is the decelerated reverse shock ( inward - facing ) .",
    "its velocity is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the pressure enhancement that depends only on the density jump @xmath58 and varies between 1 and 6 ( see equation 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the rest frame of the explosion ,",
    "deceleration of the transmitted reverse shock becomes @xmath59 . with @xmath60 ,",
    "the overpressure is @xmath61 , and @xmath62 increases to @xmath63 , in good agreement with hydrodynamical simulations ( figure [ hydro ] ) .",
    "the reflected shock propagates first back into the shocked ejecta , and then into the shocked ambient medium . at 100 yr",
    ", it has already passed through the low - density contact discontinuity that separates the shocked ejecta from the shocked ambient medium , and can be seen in figure [ hydro ] as a small density discontinuity near the contact discontinuity .",
    "the reflected shock strengthens with time ( see density profile at 150 yr ) , and eventually merges with the blast wave at 175 yr , resulting in an abrupt increase of @xmath36 from 0.48 to 0.62 . by this time",
    ", @xmath62 has already decreased to about the same value after a transient phase following the sudden deceleration of the reverse shock .",
    "this decrease continues in the subsequent evolution , while @xmath36 stays about constant , so that @xmath64 .    during an extended period of time",
    "comparable with a young type ia remnant s age , pdd explosions show a more rapid expansion of the reverse shock than the forward shock ( figure [ hydro ] ) .",
    "while this still might be a reasonable interpretation for , published pdd models fail to match its properties in detail . assuming the ejecta structure of the composite model just described and identifying the blast wave with the bright middle rims at @xmath65 pc expanding at 0.62%  yr@xmath1 , the inferred preshock density @xmath51 and free expansion ejecta velocity at the reverse shock are @xmath66 @xmath9 and @xmath67 km s@xmath1 . at 8.5 kpc ,",
    "@xmath51 is several times higher than estimated in paper v , but the ejecta velocity is consistent with previous estimates .",
    "is dynamically too young , however , for the reverse shock to have reached the density jump at @xmath68 km s@xmath1 .",
    "no published pdd model has @xmath69 as high as @xmath70 km s@xmath1 , with the highest ( @xmath71 km s@xmath1 ) in the pdda model @xcite . among models considered by @xcite ,",
    "only the sub - chandrasekhar model sch has higher @xmath69 at @xmath72 km s@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , sub - chandrasekhar explosions produce large ( up to several @xmath73 ) amounts of radioactive @xmath74ti ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the strength of the ( possible ) @xmath74sc line implies that at most @xmath75 of @xmath74ti was expelled by the sn that produced @xcite .",

    "discrete absorption features with such extreme velocities are commonly seen in type ia sn spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps indicating the presence of dense shells of material @xcite .",
    "their origin is unknown , but possible explanations include a collision of ejecta with circumstellar medium or clumping within the ejecta . fast dense shells with an order - of - magnitude density contrast relative to overlying tenuous ejecta are expected to decelerate the reverse shock just like the density jump in pdd models",
    ". this might be the explanation for the fast expansion of the reverse shock in .",
    "the flux increase may be due to global effects such as an increase in magnetic - field strength , which would raise radio fluxes as well , and/or an increase in the maximum energy to which electrons are accelerated , which could raise x - ray fluxes even with constant radio .",
    "the radio flux of is rising at 1 ",
    "2% yr@xmath1 @xcite ; our ongoing jvla observations should reduce the uncertainty to determine if this rate is consistent with the x - ray rate . a higher x - ray than radio rate of increase would require an increasing maximum energy , a very interesting result .",
