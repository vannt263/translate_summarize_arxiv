    "the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory was launched on july 23 , 1999 using the space shuttle columbia .",
    "placement in its highly elliptical orbit was completed 15 days after launch .",
    "the orbit has a nominal apogee of 140,000 km and a nominal perigee of 10,000 km . with this orbit ,",
    "the satellite is above the radiation belts for more than about 75% of the 63.5-hour orbital period and uninterrupted observations lasting more than 2 days are possible .",
    "the observing efficiency , which also depends on solar activity , is typically about 65% .",
    "the spacecraft has been functioning superbly since launch .",
    "the specified design life of the mission was 5 years ; however , the only perishable is gas for maneuvering and is sized to allow operation for much more than 10 years .",
    "the orbit will be stable for decades .",
    "the heart of the observatory is the x - ray telescope made of four concentric , precision - figured , superpolished wolter-1 telescopes , similar to those used for both the _ einstein _  and _ rosat _  observatories , but of much higher quality , larger diameter , and longer focal length .",
    "the telescope s on - axis point spread function , as measured during ground calibration , had a full - width at half - maximum less than 0.5 arcsec and a half - power diameter less than 1 arcsec .",
    "a relatively mild dependence on energy , resulting from diffractive scattering by surface microroughness , attests to the better than 3-angstroms - rms surface roughness measured with optical metrology during fabrication and confirmed by the ground x - ray testing .",
    "the on - orbit performance met expectations .",
    "there are two focal plane cameras on the observatory . the pennsylvania state university ( psu , university park , pennsylvania ) and the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit , cambridge , massachusetts ) designed and fabricated the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) with ccds produced by mit s lincoln laboratory .",
    "made of a 2-by-2 array of front - illuminated ( fi ) , 2.5-cm - square ccds , acis - i provides high - resolution spectrometric imaging over a 17-arcmin - square field of view .",
    "acis - s , a 6-by-1 array of 4 fi ccds and two back - illuminated ( bi ) ccds mounted along the _ chandra _  transmission grating dispersion direction , serves both as the primary read - out detector for the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) , and , using the one bi ccd which can be placed at the aim point of the telescope , also provides high - resolution spectrometric imaging extending to lower energies but over a smaller ( 8-arcmin - square ) field than acis - i .",
    "the smithsonian astrophysical observatory ( sao , cambridge , massachusetts ) , designed and fabricated the other focal plane camera the high resolution imager ( hrc ) ( murray et al .",
    "made of a single 10-cm - square microchannel plate ( mcp ) , the hrc - i provides high - resolution imaging over a 30-arcmin - square field of view .",
    "a second detector made of 3 rectangular mcp segments ( 3-cm @xmath0 10-cm each ) mounted end - to - end along the grating dispersion direction , the hrc - s , serves as the primary read - out detector for the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) .",
    "more details as to the technical performance of the observatory may be found in weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that the names of snr are often given in papers using their galactic coordinates and a  g  prefix .",
    "this prefix is , however , used by name resolvers such as simbad for high proper motion stars appearing in the giclas catalog and it has been recommended that one use the snr designation instead .",
    "we shall do so in this review .",
    "our review is representative of _ chandra _  observations and is not intended to be exhaustive .",
    "thus , if we have omitted a particular observation no slight to the work was intended . finally , we emphasize that there are many excellent reviews and conference proceedings concerning the astrophysics associated with supernova remnants and , where relevant , the compact objects within them .",
    "these reviews and proceedings include : becker and pavlov ( 2001 ) , aschenbach ( 2002 ) pavlov , zavlin , and sanwal ( 2002 ) , slane ( 2002 ) , canizares ( 2004 ) , decourchelle ( 2004 ) , slane ( 2005 ) , and rakowski ( 2005 ) .",
    "our purpose here is to review the outstanding contributions that observations using _ chandra _  have made to the discipline .",
    "we urge interested readers to include a careful reading of these reviews in addition to reading this paper .",
    "an excellent introduction to the topic of compact central sources in supernova remnants may be found in kaplan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "although not originally discovered with _",
    ", observations using the observatory have both clarified , and drawn further attention to , the existence of a group of compact objects associated with snr that are radio quiet , unpulsed in x - rays , and have characteristic x - ray spectra described by a blackbody with characteristic temperatures of order 0.4 kev , without indication of a non - thermal component .",
    "the associated blackbody radii are smaller than the radii of canonical neutron stars .",
    "these objects have been aptly termed compact central objects ( ccos ) by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "( sources of this ilk have previously been referred to as `` radio quiet neutron stars '' by caraveo , bignami , & trmper 1996 . )",
    "although several sources exhibit these properties , it is not clear that they form a class in the sense that there is an universally accepted explanation for their characteristics .",
    "the prevailing , perhaps contradictory , interpretation is that the spectral properties of the ccos are the result of hot spots on the surfaces of neutron stars formed during the supernova .",
    "the inability then to find any evidence for pulsations in the x - ray flux from the majority of these sources must be confronted .",
    "many discussions leave one with the impression that new observations and more sensitive searches for pulsations will ultimately discover periodic behavior and thus validate the explanation . in general , detection of pulsations",
    "has not been forthcoming , and so perhaps deeper looks at other potential explanations might be in order .",
    "one possible explanation involves very long periods requiring some mechanism to carry off the angular momentum .",
    "one might also begin to question the interpretation of the spectral data .",
    "the tie between spectral fits and physical interpretations can be overdone .",
    "thus , simply because a blackbody spectrum fits the data , this does not necessarily imply that the source is a blackbody emitter .",
    "another spectrum , more representative of the true physical situation , may fit the data equally well .",
    "it is a challenge to the theorists to tell us just what this alternative spectrum might be .",
    "cassiopeia a ( cas a ) is often referred to as the `` first light '' observation made with _",
    "it is historically interesting that this is not quite accurate .",
    "the first x - rays that were observed with _",
    "the last door was opened took place on august 12-th , 1999 and led to the discovery of the z=0.32 agn nicknamed `` leon x-1 '' ( weisskopf et al .",
    "the nickname honors the _ chandra _",
    "telescope scientist , leon van speybroeck .",
    "the observatory was next pointed at the radio - loud quasar pks 0637@xmath1752 ( schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ) chosen as the target for which on - orbit optimization of the imaging properties of the observatory were performed .",
    "after bore - sighting and focusing the telescope , only then was the official `` first - light '' image of cas a obtained .",
    "one of the principal features of the first cas a image , shown in figure  [ f : casa ] , was the clear presence of a point source ( tananbaum 1999 ) near the center of the remnant and apparent after only a few minutes of observing .",
    "pavlov et al .  ( 2000 ) argued , convincingly , that the source was the compact object associated with the remnant .",
    "pavlov et al .  ( 2000 ) also established the nature of the spectral parameters , noting that no unique spectral fits were forthcoming from the data in hand at the time .",
    "fits to a power law yielded high photon indices ( of order 3 to 4 ) whereas fits to a blackbody led to temperatures of about 0.5 kev . as noted above , these authors coined the very apt description for this source  compact central object ( cco )  and favored the interpretation that the cco is a neutron star whose x - ray emission is primarily from a restricted region of the surface .    subsequently , chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) provided additional analyses of both spectral and timing data , setting a 3-@xmath2 upper limit to the pulsed fraction of less than 35% for periods longer than 20-ms .",
    "additional period searches were performed by murray et al .",
    "( 2002a ) utilizing hrc - s data in order to extend the period searches to shorter periods . using a 50 ksec observation they also failed to detect any significant evidence for pulsations .",
    "more recently , and discussed in detail in [   [ jph : casa ] ] a @xmath3 s acis - s3 observation has been performed . to our knowledge ,",
    "no pulsations have thus far been detected in these data , although the search would be limited to periods longer than several seconds due to the time resolution in this mode .",
    "the snr 266.2@xmath11.2 ( aka rx j09852.0@xmath14622 and sometimes referred to as `` vela junior '' ) was discovered with _ rosat _  by aschenbach ( 1998 ) .",
    "prior to observations with _",
    "chandra _ , a number of x - ray observations had been performed with at least two , if not more , possible x - ray point sources being associated with this remnant  see the introduction to , and references in , pavlov et al .  ( 2001 ) .",
    "pavlov et al .  ( 2001 ) used _ chandra _  and the acis imaging array to pinpoint the location of a bright x - ray source ( cxou j085201.4@xmath1461753 ) 4@xmath4 north of the snr center .",
    "this was the only bright x - ray source they found near the center of the remnant . using the _ chandra_-based position to refine and guide a search for optical counterparts , they found none and established stringent upper limits to the optical flux in both b and r. these authors then used the corresponding lower limit to the x - ray to optical flux ratio to argue that the source is the compact remnant of the sn .",
    "the quality of the x - ray spectra determined from this particular observation was limited by the short observing time ( 3 ksec ) and by pulse pileup due to the brightness of the source coupled with the readout time ( frame time ) of the ccds .    to refine the spectral parameters , and to provide moderately high time resolution data useful for searching for pulsations ,",
    "the source was again observed with _",
    "chandra _  by kargaltsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using acis - i in the continuous - clocking mode .",
    "this mode provides only one - dimensional images but yields higher time resolution ( 2.85 ms in this case ) especially useful for mitigating pulse pileup .",
    "this observation was also ten times longer than the previous _ chandra _  observation .",
    "spectral fits to a power law were found to be statistically unacceptable , whereas a blackbody model , with a temperature of 0.4 kev , provided a statistically acceptable fit . as with cas",
    "a and the other ccos , the radius of the emitting sphere was found to be much smaller than a canonical neutron star radius .",
    "kargaltsev et al .  (",
    "2002 ) also attempted to constrain the temperature of the entire ( putative ) neutron star surface by fitting the spectral data with a two - component blackbody model where one of the two components was constrained to a radius of 10 km .",
    "they found an upper limit to the surface temperature ( at infinity ) of 89 ev ( 99% confidence ) which would imply accelerated cooling compared to standard neutron star cooling models assuming an age of a few thousand years .",
    "( inferring accelerated cooling is not exceptional , see , e.g. the discussion of 3c58 in   [ sss:3c58 ] . )",
    "kargaltsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also searched for narrow spectral features and discussed the hint of a feature at 1.68 kev .",
    "it would be interesting to follow up on the possible spectral feature with _ xmm - newton _  to see if this is similar to the feature(s ) discovered using _",

    "(   [ ss : snr296.5 + 10 ] ) .",
    "a search for pulsations found no statistically significant periods with pulsed fractions in excess of 13% in the frequency range from 0.001 to 100 hz .",
    "we urge other observers to follow the example set by kargaltsev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in their data analysis .",
    "in particular , use the data to establish an upper limit to a possible full - surface blackbody in order to constrain a neutron star temperature , and search for possible spectral features that appear as residuals to the continuum models .",
    "the results of these analyses are very useful in addressing some of the potentially interesting astrophysical questions concerning compact objects and in particular the ccos .      the bright point source at about 6@xmath4 from the dynamical center of puppis a was discovered by petre et al .",
    "( 1982 ) using the _ einstein_observatory .",
    "the object has been studied with numerous x - ray satellites and in other wavelength bands ( see e.g. the introduction to hui and becker ( 2005 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the early _ chandra _  acis observation discussed by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) found a spectrum both consistent with previous x - ray observations and the cco classification  namely that the data were described by a blackbody with an associated radius much less than that of a neutron star . in this case , spectral fitting with a neutron star hydrogen atmosphere yielded a radius more like that of a neutron star .",
    "the acis observations were followed by observations with the hrc designed to search both for pulsations and a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the hrc image is shown in figure  [ f : puppisa ] and clearly there is no obvious evidence for a pwn , however pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) gave no quantitative upper limits .",
    "note that gaensler , bock and stappers ( 2000 ) did provide quantitative upper limits as to the presence of a radio pwn ( on scales greater than about 30 `` x 30 '' up to about 30 ) .",
    "pavlov et al .  ( 2002a ) used the hrc - data to search for pulsations and found no evidence for pulsations for pulses with a pulsed fraction of greater than 10% in the period range from 0.003 to 300 seconds .",
    "pavlov et al .",
    "( 2002a ) do not state the confidence level to be associated with this upper limit .      the source 1e 161348@xmath15055 was discovered using the _ einstein_observatory by tuohy and garmire ( 1980 ) and is associated with the snr rcw 103 ( aka snr 332.4@xmath10.4 ) . the central point source was considered to be the prototype of a cooling neutron star ( becker and aschenbach 2002 ) prior to observations with _",
    "interestingly , the rcw 103 source was also the first radio - quiet x - ray source found in a young snr and , as such , may be considered to be the first detected cco .",
    "the source s detailed characteristics ( see below ) are , however , somewhat different from the majority of ccos such as cas  a and , as has also been noted by others ( e.g. pavlov , zavlin , and sanwal 2002 ) , it is not clear that all ccos form a single class of objects .",
    "garmire et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using _ chandra _  reported a precise position and strong evidence for the detection of a significant portion of a potentially periodic light curve corresponding to a @xmath5-hr period based on the 5.5-hr _ chandra _  observation .",
    "these same authors reported finding a similar period in archival _ asca _  data , and speculated as to the possibility that a binary period had been detected .",
    "we note that accretion was also listed as one of many possible explanations for the long term variability observed prior to the _ chandra _  observations ( see e.g. , gotthelf , petre , and vasisht 1999 ) .",
    "binarity may not be the only explanation for the periodicity .",
    "heyl and hernquist ( 2002 ) presented the case for a freely - precessing , short - period neutron star with hot spots as the possible explanation for the light curve .",
    "their model predicted that the spin period should be detectable at minimum flux , but , to date , no detection has been reported .",

    "further observations of this interesting system are clearly called for .",
    "hui and becker ( 2005 ) analyzed these _ chandra _  data together with the data from _ xmm - newton _ , fitting the data to two blackbodies and reporting on a `` promising candidate '' , albeit statistically weak , pulse period .",

    ", an x - ray point source ( 1wga j1713.4@xmath13949 ) with no nearby optical counterpart ( slane et al .",
    "1999 ) had been discovered with _ rosat _  by pfeffermann and aschenbach ( 1996 ) .",
    "more interestingly , a radio source ( psr j1713@xmath13945 ; crawford et al .",
    "2002 ) with a pulse period of 392 ms was also detected in the region .",
    "_ chandra _  observations ( lazendic et al .",
    "2003 ) played a key role as they were used to establish that the x - ray source was _ not _ at the same location as the radio pulsar .",
    "lazendic et al .  ( 2003 ) found that the central x - ray source shares several characteristics with the cco in cas a , including an x - ray spectrum whose principal component is a blackbody with a temperature of about 0.4 kev and the absence of pulsations over the frequency ranges searched ( 0.01  128 hz ) with upper limits to the pulsed fraction of better than 25% .",
    "_ chandra _  has served more than ably in many cases as a tool to isolate and resolve the various spatial components that comprise the structure of pulsar - wind nebulae .",
    "we begin our discussion of the _ chandra_contributions to this particular type of study with the remarkable images that have revealed more observational detail of the complex interaction between the central pulsar and the surrounding medium than ever before .",
    "all of the _ chandra _  pwn images appear to be consistent with a similar structure  one that is approximately axially symmetric and elongated along the symmetry or jet axis .",
    "the most common explanation identifies the jets with collimated outflows of relativistic particles along the rotation axis of the underlying pulsar .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of jets in astrophysical contexts including these associated with young pulsars and those found with active galactic nuclei is always worth comment and provides an over - riding motivation for gathering detailed information to help one learn about jet formation mechanisms .",
    "observations with _",
    "chandra _",
    "have provided not only spectacular images but also valuable and unique insights .",
    "one of the most important of these insights is the dynamic nature of the phenomena that take place in the pwn .",
    "this is particularly well illustrated in the case of the observations of the vela pulsar (   [ sss : vela ] ) described by pavlov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that discovered the variability of the northeast outer jet .",
    "the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory first observed the crab nebula and its pulsar during orbital calibration in 1999 .",
    "weisskopf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) published the zeroth - order image obtained with the hetg and read out by acis - s that showed a striking richness of x - ray spatial structures .",
    "figure  [ f : crab_full ] shows the original hetg  acis - s zeroth - order image .",
    "a number of features were observed for the first time : an x - ray inner ring within the x - ray torus ; the suggestion of a hollow - tube structure for the torus ; x - ray knots along the inner ring and ( perhaps ) along the inward extension of the x - ray jet .",
    "chandra_image also clearly resolved the x - ray torus ( aschenbach and brinkmann 1975 ) and jet and counterjet which are all features that had been previously observed ( brinkmann , aschenbach , & langmeier 1985 ; hester et al .",
    "1995 ; greiveldinger & aschenbach 1999 ) but never with such clarity . on somewhat larger scales ,",
    "the image showed a sharply bounded notch ( wsw of the pulsar ) into the x - ray nebular emission , earlier associated with the `` west bay '' of the nebula ( hester et al .",
    "visible - light polarization maps of the crab nebula ( schmidt , angel , & beaver 1979 ; hickson & van den bergh 1990 ) demonstrate that the magnetic field is parallel to the boundary of this notch , thus serving to exclude the x - ray - emitting relativistic electrons from the west bay .",
    "the most striking feature of the x - ray image , of course , is the inner elliptical ring , lying between the pulsar and the torus .",
    "the existence of such a ring had been predicted , and corresponds to a shock in the pulsar wind ( rees and gunn 1974 ; kennel and coroniti 1984 ) . on the ring",
    "reside a few compact knots , and one can be seen in figure  [ f : crab_full ] lying se of the pulsar along the projected inward extension of the jet .",
    "the surface brightness of this knot is too high to be simply explained as the superposition of the ring s and jet s surface brightnesses .",

    "it has been common practice to denote any minimum in a pulse profile to be representative of the unpulsed flux ; subtract these data from the remainder and then purport that the difference , represents the `` pulsed '' component .",
    "of course this need not be the case .",
    "one can see from the _ chandra _  image , for example , that such an approach may include the flux from the inner ring if not the entire pwn as a whole , depending on the angular resolution of the instrument .",

    "( 2002 ) analyzed two acis - s3 continuous - clocking - mode observations including the data used to initially detect the pulse period .",

    "the exact cause of the _",

    "taking all these latter data into account supports an explanation involving the fundamental and two , possibly three , harmonics of the electron cyclotron absorption in a field of order @xmath47 g .",
    "however , the two additional spectral features in the _ xmm - newton _  data have not been unambiguously accepted .",
    "mori , chonko , and hailey ( 2005 ) have cast severe doubt as to the reality of the spectral features at 2.1 and 2.8 kev .",

    "chandra_observations have done much to confirm the basic scenario and also have revealed new complexities .    as the stellar ejecta stream from the site of the sn explosion , they expand and interact with the ambient medium ( am ) , ultimately evolving into a visible supernova remnant ( snr ) . a blast wave , which precedes the ejecta , forms in the am , while a reverse shock propagates back though the ejecta .",
    "snrs gradually become strong x - ray sources over the course of typically hundreds of years as progressively greater amounts of ejecta and am are shock - heated to x - ray temperatures , a consequence of the high shock velocities ( several thousand km s@xmath19 ) during the early phases of evolution .",
    "typically the x - ray emission is dominated by the sn ejecta at these early stages , a result of both the higher density and metal - rich composition of the reverse shocked ejecta . as the amount of swept - up am grows , the ejecta tend to decrease in importance both in terms of producing x - ray emission and influencing the remnant s dynamical evolution .",
    "according to theory in the adiabatic phase of evolution , the dynamics depend only on the initial sn explosion energy and the density of the am ( taylor 1950 ; sedov 1959 ) . as a remnant ages further its blast wave velocity drops and",
    "radiative cooling at the shock becomes important .",
    "a dense cool shell of swept up am forms as all newly shocked material loses its thermal energy to radiation .",
    "this shell surrounds a hot , low density cavity of previously shocked ejecta and am .",
    "the typically low densities and short evolutionary timescales introduce an important ingredient to the x - ray emission from snrs , namely the effect of time - dependent or nonequilibrium ionization . a plasma with an electron density of 1 @xmath78 and temperature @xmath79 kev takes of order @xmath80 yr to reach collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "thus the shocked plasma in remnants , which are almost all significantly younger than this , will be in a lower state of ionization than expected based on the plasma temperature .",
    "departures from equilibrium ionization are characterized by the ionization timescale , @xmath81 , which is the product of the plasma electron density and the time since the material was heated .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot ( rh ) relations ( e.g. , shu 1992 , p.  214ff ) tell us about the properties of shocks in general , such as how the temperature and density jump across the shock front depend on the shock velocity , ratio of specific heats , and other properties of the shocked medium .",
    "however these relations fail to tell us about a number of astrophysically interesting questions , such as whether individual species in the fluid ( electrons , protons , heavy elements ) are heated to the same temperatures , or how much of the shock energy might be diverted into a population of relativistic particles ( i.e. , cosmic rays ) .",
    "these complications remain open to investigation , even though the basic properties of snr shocks are well established . in the case of an ideal gas with a ratio of specific heats equal to 5/3",
    ", the rh relations say that a strong shock moving at speed @xmath82 will heat the gas to a characteristic temperature @xmath83 .",
    "this clearly corresponds to emission in the x - ray band , where _ chandra _  has significant sensitivity .",
    "the most secure way to identify the remnant of a core collapse sne is through the presence of an associated compact object . in lieu of this",

    "the fe - rich spectra showed strong fe - l and fe - k shell emission with much weaker si and s lines , consistent with explosive silicon burning .",
    "a further and perhaps more remarkable finding was that the fe - rich material along the eastern edge of cas a lay outside the si - rich material , an inversion of the relative ordering in which these species should have been produced during the sn explosion .",
    "this argues for an energetic process of mixing or overturning of the ejecta possibly from neutrino - driven convection .",
    "the spectrum of the northeast jet was shown to be less fe - rich than the knots toward the east .",

    "( 2002 ) show that the fe emission in the northern region is separated from the si in terms of velocity , with the fe showing higher speeds .",

    "several sequences of o - rich knots selected from different parts of the remnant are analyzed in laming & hwang ( 2003 ) to infer variations in the amount of explosion energy directed into different azimuthal directions .",
    "the asymmetry they determine is as much as a factor of two with more energy going into the polar regions ( near the jet ) than into equatorial regions .",
    "this level of asymmetry is , however , less than that expected from asymmetric core collapse explosion models .",

    "however , as has been know since the time of _ asca _  ( hayashi et al . 1994 ) , the global spectrum of this remnant can not be adequately described by a single component plasma model .",
    "the hetg data provide keen insight into why this so .",
    "there are azimuthal variations in the relative brightnesses of hetg spectral line images that suggest large scale variations in the plasma properties ( for example , the ionization state toward the north is more advanced than the south ) .",
    "but perhaps of greater import is the clear evidence for differences in size of the various spectral line images .",
    "the sense of these differences is that lines preferentially produced at lower ionization timescales have images that are smaller , while higher ionization - timescale lines have larger images .",
    "this trend is fully compatible with a reverse shock origin , where the innermost visible ejecta are the most recently shocked , while the outermost has been shocked for the longest time .",
    "these observational results provide important constraints on the profiles of temperature and ionization timescale throughout the shocked ejecta .",

    "equivalent width maps were used to identify metal - rich ejecta , which are preferentially distributed around the periphery .",
    "a prominent feature in the broadband image is a narrow , twisted belt of emission running approximately east - west across the center of the snr .",
    "it is composed of solar - abundance material and hence plausibly is shocked circumstellar gas .",

    "another feature noted by these authors was a set of narrow filaments with normal composition located around nearly the entire circumference of the snr .",
    "it was suggested that these filaments might be a relic structure in the circumstellar ( perhaps related to the progenitor s stellar wind ) being overrun by the blast wave .",
    "the more conventional explanation presented by these authors that the narrow , thermal rims represent the outer blast wave may be supported by the presence of similar features at the outer edge of 1e 0102.2@xmath172.2 ( figure  [ f : e0102 ] ) .    in a subsequent study park et al .",
    "( 2004a ) examine in more detail the acis - s3 spectra of a number of small - scale emission features that cover a representative range of spectra from across the snr . a spectrum from the central belt",

    "other regions , chosen for their prominent line emission , are clearly from sn ejecta and display greatly enhanced abundances of o , ne , and mg compared to si , s and fe . these abundance patterns are similar to those in 1e 0102@xmath172.2 , while they are quite unlike those in cas a , which is dominated by si- and fe - rich ejecta .",
    "additionally snr 292.0 + 1.8 and 1e 0102@xmath172.2 did not appear to undergo the same sort of extensive overturning of their ejecta that cas a experienced .",

    "since this remnant hosts the famous soft @xmath50-ray repeater sgr 0526@xmath166 , insights into the nature of the progenitor star based on the properties of the ejecta would be important to obtain .",
    "unfortunately no other metal rich ejecta fragments have been reported and the statistical quality of the knot just described was barely adequate to reveal its metal - rich nature .",
    "deeper insights into the nature of the progenitor will require a considerably longer observation of n49 .",
    "a dramatic example of an lmc remnant where ejecta fragments , bullets , or shrapnel may extend beyond the main shock boundary is the case of n63a ( warren , hughes , & slane 2003 ) .",

    "synchrotron cooling of the high energy electrons accelerated at the shock front is one widely discussed interpretation for the origin of the thin featureless x - ray filaments ( vink & laming 2003 ; berezhko , ksenofontov , & vlk 2003 ; berezhko & vlk 2004 ; vlk , berezhko , & ksenofontov  2005 ; warren et al .",
    "these studies provide estimates for the magnetic field within the filaments of order 100 @xmath20 g , far above the galactic value and evidently requiring magnetic field amplification at the shock front .",
    "an alternate view ( pohl , yan , & lazarian 2005 ) posits that the x - ray filaments are actually magnetic filaments . in this case",
    "the x - ray emission falls off rapidly behind the shock because the magnetic field , initially enhanced , is efficiently damped over a post - shock distance of some @xmath111@xmath112 cm .",
    "careful comparison of radio and x - ray observations of young remnants might be able to discriminate between the two interpretations presented here .",
    "_ chandra _  has also discovered new cases of shell - like snrs with powerlaw continuum . in the case of the ejecta - dominated snr 0509@xmath167.5 , warren & hughes ( 2004 ) , based on dynamical arguments ,",
    "propose that the continuum emission is likely to have a nonthermal origin .",
    "bamba et al .",
    "( 2004 ) report the discovery of nonthermal x - ray emission from a portion of the shell of the lmc superbubble 30 dor c. the spectral index of the emission is consistent with the other cases mentioned here .",
    "these objects , both in the lmc , are too distant for even _",
    "chandra_to provide useful constraints on the thickness of the nonthermal emission regions .",
    "direct detection of the hadronic component of cosmic rays in snrs is a critical apect of the overall scenario that remains to be demonstrated .",
    "a prime method for doing this relies on observing tev @xmath50-rays from the decay of pions produced when cosmic ray protons accelerated at the snr shock interact with local interstellar gas . such emission has not yet been confidently detected .",
    "if the acceleration process is efficient , a significant fraction of the snr shock energy can be diverted from the thermal gas and end up in the relativistic component . in a study of the smc snr",
    "1e 0102.2@xmath172.2 , hughes , rakowski , & decourchelle ( 2000b ) measured the expansion rate ( proper motion ) of the snr to determine a blast wave velocity of @xmath616000 km s@xmath19 . from this value",
    "they determined a range of electron temperatures 2.545 kev , dependent on the degree of collisionless electron heating .",
    "their measured electron temperature from _ chandra _  acis - s3 spectroscopy ( @xmath113 kev ) was significantly lower than the range expected from the shock velocity .",
    "they argued that the only plausible way to reconcile the different electron temperature values was if a significant fraction of the shock energy , rather than contributing to the heating of the post - shock electrons and ions , had gone into generating cosmic rays .",
    "it should also be possible to rely on the dynamical effects that cosmic ray protons have on the evolution of snrs ( decourchelle , ellison , & ballet 2000 ) . the softer equation of state of a relativistic fluid and the possibility that cosmic ray particles may escape from the shock result in a compression factor that is larger than the typical value of 4 .",
    "this results in a shrinking of the gap between the contact discontinuity and forward shock .",
    "warren et al .",
    "( 2005 ) measure the relative locations of the forward shock , contact discontinuity , and reverse shock in the tycho snr using _ chandra_observations .",
    "the observed distance between the contact discontinuity and forward shock is too small to be explained by hydrodynamic models that ignore cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the authors show that the energy density in relativistic electrons alone is insufficient to alter the dynamics of the forward shock , which points to the requirement for a signficant component of relativistic ions .",
    "the energy density of the cosmic ray ions needs to be 50 times or more that of the electrons , close to the well - established ratio of 100 for galactic cosmic rays .",
