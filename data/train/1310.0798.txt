    "isothermal transformations are fondamental in thermodynamics , in particular they are one of the components of the carnot cycle . as often in thermodynamics , they represent _ idealized _ transformations where the system is maintained at a constant temperature by being in constant contact with a _ large",

    "the second law prescribes that the change of the free energy @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the thermodynamic entropy ) , satisfy the clausius inequality @xmath8 , with equality satisfied for _ reversible quasistatic",

    "the purpose of this article is to prove mathematically that the termodynamic behavior of isothermal transformations , as described above , can be obtained by proper space and time scaling of a microscopic dynamics .",
    "we consider a one dimensional system , where the equilibrium thermodynamic intensive parameters are given by the temperature @xmath10 and the tension ( or pressure ) @xmath11 , or by the extensive observables : length ( volume ) @xmath12 and energy @xmath13 .",
    "this simplifies the problem as only two parameters are needed to specify the equilibrium thermodynamic state and no phase transitions will appear .",
    "the microscopic model is given by a chain of @xmath14 anharmonic oscillators , where the first particle is attached to a fix point and on the last particle acts a force ( tension ) @xmath15 , eventually changing in time .",
    "the action of the thermal bath is modeled by independent langevin processes at temperature @xmath2 , acting on each particle .",
    "a mathematically equivalent model for the heat bath is given by random collisions with the environment : at exponentially distributed independent random times , each particle has a new velocity distributed by a centered gaussian with variance @xmath2 .    as a consequence of the action of the thermal bath , the time evolution of the microscopic configuration of the positions and velocities of the particles is stochastic .",
    "the distance between the first and the last particle defines the microscopic length of the system , while the energy is given by the sum of the kinetic energies of each particle and the potential energy of each spring .    for each value of the applied tension @xmath11",

    "we prove that , under a proper macroscopic rescaling of space and time , all these ( random ) quantities , converge to _ deterministic _ values predicted by thermodynamics .",
    "when the system is out of equilibrium , either for a change in the tension applied , or by initial conditions , there is an evolution of the local length ( or stretch ) on a diffusive macroscopic space - time scale .",
    "this is governed by a diffusion equation that describe the inhomogeneity of the system during the isothermal transformation . after an infinite time ( in this scale ) it reach the new equilibrium state given by a constant value of the local lenght , corresponding to the value of the tension @xmath17 .",

    "irreversible _ thermodynamic transformation , that satisfies a strict clausius inequality between work and change of the free energy . under a further rescaling of time , that correspond in a slower change of the applied tension , we obtain a _ reversible quasi - static _ transformation that satisfies clausius inequality .",
    "in fact , for the irreversible transformation we obtain the following relation between heat and changes of thermodynamic entropy @xmath7 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a strictly positive dissipation term that has an explicit expression in terms of the solution of the diffusive equation that govern macroscopically the transformation ( cf . ) . in the quasi - static limit",
