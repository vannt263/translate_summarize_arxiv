    "the gauge / string duality is a conjectured equivalence between strongly coupled gauge field theories and weakly coupled perturbative string theories @xcite .",
    "one of the most important problems in understanding this duality is how the space - time geometry described in the string theory emerges in the framework of the corresponding gauge theory .",
    "if the duality is true , the background space - time in the string theory should emerge in the strong coupling region of the gauge theories , although it may not be apparent in the weak coupling region .",
    "see @xcite for recent developments on the emergent space - time .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a one - dimensional gauge theory in the strong coupling region and study the emergent phenomena of geometries .",
    "the theory we consider is a matrix quantum mechanics called the plane wave matrix model ( pwmm ) , which was proposed as a fundamental formulation of the m - theory on the pp - wave background in the light - cone frame @xcite .",
    "pwmm has @xmath6 symmetry , which consists of @xmath7 bosonic symmetry and 16 supersymmetries .",
    "pwmm is a mass deformation of the bfss matrix model @xcite and has many discrete vacua given by fuzzy spheres that are labeled by representations of the @xmath8 lie algebra . in this paper , we consider the case where the representation is given by a direct sum of the same irreducible representations . in this case , the vacua are labeled by two integers @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dimension of the irreducible representation and @xmath11 is the multiplicity .    for the theory around each vacuum of pwmm , a corresponding gravity dual geometry in the type iia superstring theory was constructed in @xcite ( also studied in @xcite in the polchinski - strassler approximation ) .",
    "the geometry is called the bubbling geometry and characterized by fermionic droplets on a certain two - dimensional subspace of the space - time , which define a boundary condition of the solution . by a simple change of variables ,",
    "the geometry can be equivalently characterized by a three - dimensional axially symmetric electrostatic system with some conducting disks ( see the next section ) .",
    "the geometry locally has a topology of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 corresponds to the space on which the electrostatic system is defined . for theories around the above mentioned vacua labeled by two integers @xmath9 , the gravity dual geometries",
    "were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the integers , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , are interpreted as the d2-brane and ns5-brane charges in the dual geometries , respectively @xcite .    in order to see the emergence of this geometry in pwmm",
    ", we consider a complex scalar field @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is one of @xmath16 scalar fields , @xmath17 are @xmath18 scalars and @xmath19 is the time coordinate .",
    "we consider a quarter bps sector of pwmm which consists of correlators of only @xmath20 s .",
    "since @xmath20 has two real degrees of freedom , it should describe a two - dimensional surface on the gravity dual geometry .",
    "let @xmath21 be a two - dimensional subspace in the bubbling geometry described by @xmath20 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath19 , insertions of the field @xmath22 in the path integral break the original @xmath23 symmetry to @xmath24 , which is the symmetry of @xmath25 with a marked point .",
    "hence , @xmath21 is expected to be fibered on the marked point on @xmath25 . from the original symmetry ,",
    "however , @xmath21 should exists everywhere on @xmath26 , so that the topology of the total space should be locally given by @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the subspace @xmath21 can naturally be identified with the space @xmath28 of the electrostatic problem .",
    "recently , the localization method , which makes exact computations possible for some supersymmetric operators @xcite , was applied to the above sector of @xmath20 @xcite . in this paper , using this result , we first show that this sector can be mapped to a one - dimensional interacting fermi gas system .",
    "we then find that in a strong coupling region , the mean - field density of the fermi particles satisfies the same integral equation as the charge density which appears in the electrostatic system in the gravity side .",
    "thus we identify the mean - field density with the charge density .",
    "since the charge density ultimately determines the gravity dual solution , this identification makes it possible to reconstruct the bubbling geometry based on the gauge theory .",
    "this situation is very similar to the case of the bubbling geometries in the type iib supergravity which has @xmath29 symmetry and 16 supersymmetries @xcite .",
    "these geometries correspond to a sector of the half bps operators in the @xmath30 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) on @xmath31 that consists of zero modes on @xmath32 of a complex scalar field @xmath33 .",
    "this sector can also be mapped to a one - dimensional fermionic system and its phase space density can be identified with the the droplets in the gravity side @xcite .    in the case of @xmath30 sym ,",
    "the sector of @xmath34 is protected by the non - renormalization theorem , so it does not depend on the coupling constant @xcite . in our case , however , the sector we consider in this paper depends on various tunable parameters such as the coupling constant and the parameters @xmath9 of the vacua .",
    "hence we can also consider some scaling limits for these parameters .",
    "the gravity dual of pwmm has two interesting scaling limits which we call the d2-brane limit and the ns5-brane limit in this paper @xcite . in the d2-brane limit ,",
    "the ns5-brane charges decouple and only the d2-brane charge is left in the geometry .",
    "the geometry asymptotically becomes the d2-brane solution . in the same manner",
    ", the ns5-brane limit sends the geometry to the ns5-brane solution . in this paper",
    ", we show that the d2-brane and the ns5-brane limits are realized on the gauge theory side as the free and strongly coupled limits of the fermi gas system , respectively . in these limits",
    ", we solve the fermi gas system at the planar level and reproduce the radii of the @xmath0 s in the gravity side .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 corresponds to the spatial worldvolume of fivebranes in the case of the ns5-brane limit and its radius has been known to be proportional to @xmath35 in the string unit , where @xmath36 is the t hooft coupling in pwmm@xcite .",
    "our gauge theory result reproduces this behavior and hence gives a strong evidence for the description of fivebranes in pwmm proposed in @xcite .",

    "to study the theory around a fixed vacuum of pwmm , the appropriate boundary condition is such that all fields approach to the vacuum configuration at the both infinities .",

    "this relation is obtained by equating the t hooft expansion and the expansion with respect to @xmath177 . by adding the @xmath305 corrections to the analysis of the fermi gas model in the ns5-brane limit",
    ", we may be able to answer this problem .",
    "secondly , though we studied the vacua ( [ irr decom ] ) with @xmath85 in this paper , the sector of @xmath20 can be mapped to a fermi gas system also in the case of @xmath306 . in this case",
    "the fermi particles have a labeling , @xmath307 , and the form of the interaction depends on @xmath308 .",

    "<S> the gravity dual geometry of the plane wave matrix model is given by the bubbling geometry in the type iia supergravity , which is described by an axially symmetric electrostatic system . </S>",
