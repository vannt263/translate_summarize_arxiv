    "the reproduction of the hadron mass spectrum from first principles is an important challenge for lattice",
    "ground state spectroscopy on the lattice is by now a well understood problem and impressive agreement with experiments has been achieved .",
    "however , the lattice study of excited states @xcite@xcite is not as advanced .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : firstly , the masses of excited states have to be extracted from subleading exponentials in the spectral decomposition of two - point functions . secondly , the construction of hadron interpolators which have a good overlap with the wave functions of excited states is much more challenging than for the ground state .",
    "concerning the first issue , the extraction of the signal from the subleading exponential , several approaches such as constrained fitting or the maximum entropy method can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "here we apply the variational method @xcite , where not only a single correlator is analyzed , but a matrix of correlators is used .",
    "this matrix is built from several different interpolators , all with the quantum numbers of the desired state .",
    "the variational method also incorporates in a natural way a solution to the second issue , the wave function of the excited states : one uses a set of basis interpolators which is large enough to span ground and excited states and the variational method finds the optimal combinations of them . in principle",
    ", no prior knowledge of or assumption about the composition of the physical hadron state has to be used .",
    "however , the variational method can succeed only if the basis set of hadron interpolators is rich enough to span ground and excited states . on the other hand ,",
    "the basis should also be constructed such that it can be implemented numerically in an efficient way without the need for many different quark sources . in this article",
    "we use a twofold strategy for building our basis interpolators : we use interpolators with different dirac structures and furthermore compose them using different types of smearing for the individual quarks . in particular , we apply different amounts of jacobi smearing @xcite and in this way create `` narrow '' and `` wide '' sources .",
    "a combination of these allows for spatial wave functions with nodes , which are essential for a good overlap with excited states .",
    "following a first test of the outlined strategy @xcite and an analysis of mesons with our method @xcite , in this paper we present in detail the results obtained for baryons . in the next section",
    "we collect the basic equations for the implementation of the variational method , detail the construction of our sources and give an overview of the parameters of our numerical simulation .",
    "subsequently we discuss effective mass plots , the eigenmodes of the correlation matrix , as well as the baryon masses and their chiral extrapolations .",
    "the paper closes with a summary and an outlook .",
    "as already stated , we use the variational method @xcite to extract the masses of ground and excited states . starting from a set of basis operators @xmath0 , we compute the correlation matrix @xmath1 in hilbert space these correlators have the decomposition @xmath2 using the factorization of the amplitudes one can show @xcite that the eigenvalues @xmath3 of the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath4 behave as @xmath5 \\ ; ,   \\label{eigenvaluedecay}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the mass of the @xmath7-th state and @xmath8 is the difference to the masses of neighboring states . in eq .",
    "( [ generalized ] ) the eigenvalue problem is normalized with respect to a timeslice @xmath9 .    at this point",
    "we remark , that the variational method can be generalized to include also ghost contributions as they appear in a quenched or partially quenched calculation .",
    "the fact that ghost contributions play a role also for baryons was first stressed in @xcite . in the spectral decomposition ( [ corrmatrix ] )",
    "ghosts appear with a modified time dependence , possibly including also a negative sign . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the ghost contribution couples to an individual eigenvalue ( up to the correction term ) in the same way as a `` proper '' physical state .",
    "thus , ghost contributions are disentangled from the desired states and need not be modeled in the further analysis of the exponential decay of the eigenvalues .",
    "let us finally stress that also the eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ generalized ] ) contain interesting information .",
    "if one plots the entries of the eigenvector as a function of @xmath10 , one finds that they are essentially constant in the same range of @xmath10-values where plateaus of the effective mass are seen ( compare fig .  [ evec_vs_t ] ) .",
    "these plateaus can be used to optimize the interval for fitting the eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvectors encode the information which linear combinations of the basis interpolators couple to which eigenvalue and thus provide one with a `` fingerprint '' of the corresponding states . comparing these fingerprints for different values of the quark mass is an important cross - check for the correct identification of the states .",
