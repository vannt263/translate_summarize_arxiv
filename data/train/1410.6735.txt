    "in an earlier work of the author ( @xcite,@xcite ) investigated the concept of distance extracted from the work of cyrill vrs and , translating the standard methods of euclidean plane geometry into the hyperbolic plane , apply it for various configurations .",
    "we gave a model independent construction for the famous problem of malfatti ( discussed in @xcite ) and gave some interesting formulas connected with the geometry of hyperbolic triangles .",
    "in this paper we follow the investigations above for some other concept of the hyperbolic triangle .",
    "the points @xmath0 denote the vertices of a triangle .",
    "the lengths of the edges opposite to these vertices are @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the angles at @xmath0 are denoted by @xmath2 , respectively . if the triangle has a right angle , it is always at @xmath3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath4 denotes half of the area of the triangle ; more precisely , we have @xmath5 .    *",
    "* connections between the trigonometric and hyperbolic trigonometric functions : * @xmath6 * * law of sines : * @xmath7 * * law of cosines : * @xmath8 * * law of cosines on the angles : * @xmath9 * * the area of the triangle : * @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the height of the triangle corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the signed lengths of the segments into which the foot point of the height divides the side @xmath14 . * * heron s formula : * @xmath15 * * formulas on lambert s quadrangle : * the vertices of the quadrangle are @xmath16 and the lengths of the edges are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the only angle which is not right - angle is @xmath19 .",
    "then , for the sides , we have : @xmath20 and @xmath21 moreover , for the angles , we have : @xmath22 and @xmath23      in @xcite we extracted the concepts of the distance of real points following the method of the book of cyrill vrs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we extend the plane with two types of points , one type of the points at infinity and the other one the type of ideal points . in a projective model",
    "these are the boundary and external points of a model with respect to the embedding real projective plane .",
    "two parallel lines determine a point at infinity and two ultraparallel lines an ideal point which is the pole of their common transversal .",
    "now the concept of the line can be extended ; a line is real if it has real points ( in this case it also has two points at infinity and the other points on it are ideal points being the poles of the real lines orthogonal to the mentioned one ) .",
    "the extended real line is a closed compact set with finite length .",
    "we also distinguish the line at infinity which contains precisely one point at infinity and the so - called ideal line which contains only ideal points . by definition",
    "the common lengths of these lines are @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a constant of the hyperbolic plane and @xmath26 is the imaginary unit . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath27 .",
    "two points on a line determine two segments @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the sum of the lengths of these segments is @xmath30 .",
    "we define the length of a segment as an element of the linearly ordered set @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the linearly ordered set of real numbers extracted with two new numbers with the `` real infinity '' @xmath33 and its additive inverse @xmath34 .",
    "the infinities can be considered as new `` numbers '' having the properties that either `` there is no real number greater or equal to @xmath35 '' or `` there is no real number less or equal to @xmath34 '' .",
    "we also introduce the following operational rules : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 for real @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath41 is not a group , the rule of associativity holds only such expressions which contain at most two new objects .",
    "in fact , @xmath42 is a contradiction .",
    "we also require that the equality @xmath43 holds for every real number @xmath44 and for brevity we introduce the respective notations @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we extract the usual definition of hyperbolic function based on the complex exponential function by the following formulas @xmath47 we also assume that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    assuming that the trigonometric formulas of hyperbolic triangles are also valid with ideal vertices the definition of the mentioned lengths of the complementary segments of a line are given .",
    "we defined all of the possible lengths of a segment on the basis of the type of the line contains them .",
    "the definitions of the respective cases can be found in table 1 .",
    "we abbreviate the words real , infinite and ideal by symbols @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "@xmath54 means a real ( positive ) distance of the corresponding usual real elements which are a real point or the real polar line of an ideal point , respectively .",
    "every box in the table contains two numbers which are the lengths of the two segments determined by the two points .",
    "for example , the distance of a real and an ideal point is a complex number .",
    "its real part is the distance of the real point to the polar of the ideal point with a sign , this sign is positive in the case when the polar line intersects the segment between the real and ideal points , and is negative otherwise .",
    "the imaginary part of the length is @xmath55 , implying that the sum of the lengths of two complementary segments of this projective line has total length @xmath56 .",
    "consider now an infinite point .",
    "this point can also be considered as the limit of real points or limit of ideal points of this line . by definition",
    "the distance from a point at infinity of a real line to any other real or infinite point of this line is @xmath57 according to that it contains or not ideal points .",
    "if , for instance , @xmath12 is an infinite point and @xmath58 is a real one , then the segment @xmath28 contains only real points has length @xmath35 .",

    "the numbers @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent real distances , can be seen on fig .",
    "1 , respectively . the general connection between the angles and distances is the following : _ every distance of a pair of points is the measure of the angle of their polars multiplied by @xmath26 .",

    "_      there are many interesting statements on triangle centers . in this section",
    "we mention some of them concentrating only the centroid , circumcenters and incenters , respectively ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the notation of this subsection follows the previous part of this paper : the vertices of the triangle are @xmath0 , the corresponding angles are @xmath66 and the lengths of the sides opposite to the vertices are @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we also use the notion @xmath67 for the perimeter of the triangle .",

    "in most cases the formulas are valid for ideal elements and elements at infinity and when the distances are complex numbers , respectively .",
    "the only exception when the operation which needs to the examined formula is understandable . before the examination of hyperbolic triangle centers we collect some further important formulas on hyperbolic triangles .",
    "we can consider them in our extracted manner .",
    "the _ staudtian of a hyperbolic triangle _ something - like similar ( but definitely distinct ) to the concept of the euclidean area . in spherical trigonometry",
    "the twice of this very important quantity called by staudt the sine of the trihedral angle @xmath69 and later neuberg suggested the names ( first ) `` staudtian '' and the `` norm of the sides '' , respectively .",
    "we prefer in this paper the name `` staudtian '' as a token of our respect for the great geometer staudt .",
    "let @xmath70 then we have @xmath71 this observation leads to the following formulas on the staudtian : @xmath72 from the first equality of ( 4.2 ) we get that @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the height of the triangle corresponding to the vertex @xmath3 .",
    "as a consequence of this concept we can give homogeneous coordinates for the points of the plane with respect to a basic triangle as follows :    let @xmath75 be a non - degenerated reference triangle of the hyperbolic plane . if @xmath76 is an arbitrary point we define its coordinates by the ratio of the staudtian @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 means the staudtian of the triangle @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",

    "if @xmath87 , @xmath88 mean the staudtian of the triangles @xmath89 , @xmath90 , respectively then using ( 4.3 ) we have @xmath91 @xmath92 proving that @xmath93    the _ angular staudtian _ of the triangle defined by the equality : @xmath94 is the `` dual '' of the concept of staudtian and thus we have similar formulas on it . from the law of cosines on the angles we have @xmath95 and adding to this the addition formula of the cosine function we get that @xmath96 from this we get that @xmath97 analogously we get that @xmath98 from these equations @xmath99 finally we also have that @xmath100 and from the first equality of ( 4.8 ) we get that @xmath101 the connection between the two staudtians gives by the formula @xmath102 in fact , from ( 7 ) and ( 13 ) we get that @xmath103 implying that @xmath104 on the other hand from ( 7 ) we get immediately that @xmath105 and thus @xmath106 as we stated .",
    "the connection between the two types of the staudtian can be understood if we dived to the first equality of ( 7 ) by the analogous one in ( 19 ) we get that @xmath107 implying the equality @xmath108      we denote the medians of the triangle by @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",

    "then the getting lines are concurrent at a point @xmath255 which we call the isogonal conjugate of @xmath76 . to prove the concurrence of these lines we have to observe that if the lines @xmath86 and @xmath256 intersect the line of the side @xmath14 in the points @xmath128 and @xmath257 then the ratio of these points with respect to @xmath58 and @xmath3 has an inverse connection .",

    ". hence we can prove the following :        as a first consequence we can see immediately ( 30 ) again on the triangular coordinates of the incenter . by ( 48 )",
    "the triangular coordinates of the isogonal conjugate @xmath269 of the orthocenter is @xmath270 thus @xmath271 implying that @xmath272 comparing the coordinates of @xmath269 with the triangular coordinates of the circumcenter we can see that the isogonal conjugate of the orthocenter is the circumcenter if and only if the defect of the triangle is zero implying that the geometry of the plane is euclidean .",
    "a minimality property of the incenter follows from a generalization of the equality ( 42 ) .",

    "this proves the statement .",
    "we recall that the isogonal conjugate of the centroid is the so - called _ symmedian point _ of the triangle .",

    "since @xmath317 @xmath318 @xmath319 implies @xmath320 , the only solution is when @xmath321 and the triangle is an equilateral ( regular ) one .",
    "an interesting question in elementary hyperbolic geometry is the existence of the euler line .",

    "does not exist for each triangle .",
    "a nice result from the recent investigations on the triangle centers is the paper of a.v .",
    "akopyan @xcite in which the author defined the concepts of  pseudomedians  and  pseudoaltitudes \" giving two new centers of the hyperbolic triangle holding a deterministic euclidean property of euclidean centroid and orthocenter , respectively .",
    "he proved that the circumcenter , the intersection points of the pseudomedians ( pseudo - centroid ) , the intersection points of the pseudoaltitudes ( pseudo - orthocenter ) and the circumcenter of the circle through the footpoints of the bisectors ( the center of the feuerbach circle ) are on a hyperbolic line .",
    "a line through a vertex is called by _ pseudomedian _ if divides the area of the triangle in half .",
    "( we note that in spherical geometry steiner proved the statement that the great circles through angular points of a spherical triangle , and which bisect its area , are concurrent ( see @xcite ) .",

    "throughout on his paper akopyan assume that _ `` any two lines intersects and that three points determine a circle''_. he note in the introduction also that _",
    "`` consideration of all possible cases would not only complicate the proof , but would contain no fundamentally new ideas . to complete our arguments , we could always say that other cases follow from a theorem by analytic continuation , since the cases considered by us are sufficiently general ( they include an interior point in the configuration space ) .",
    "nevertheless , in the course of our argument we shall try to avoid major errors and show that the statements can be demonstrated without resorting to more powerful tools''_. we note that in our paper the reader can find this required extraction of the real elements by the ideal elements and the elements at infinity .",
    "we also defined all concepts using by akopyan with respect to general points and lines , furthermore his lemmas and theorem can be extracted from circles onto cycles with our method .",
    "this prove the truth of akopyan s note , post factum .        to see the equivalence of the two theory on real elements",
    "we recall that between the projective ( cayley - klein - beltrami ) and poincare models of the unit disk there is a natural correspondence , when we map to a line of the projective model to the line of the poincare model with the same ends ( points at infinity ) . on fig .",
    "6 we can see the corresponding mapping .",
    "a point @xmath203 can be realized in the first model as the point @xmath324 and in the second one as the point @xmath325 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the hyperbolic distance of the points @xmath203 and @xmath129 is @xmath40 then the euclidean distances @xmath326 or @xmath327 are equals to @xmath328 or @xmath329 , respectively .",
    "thus our analytic definitions on similarity or inversion are model independent ( end extracted ) variations of the definitions of akopyan , respectively .",
    "thus we have    the center @xmath129 of the cycle around the triangle , the center of the cycle @xmath330 around the feet of the pseudomedians , the pseudo - centroid @xmath331 and the pseudo - orthocenter @xmath332 are on the same line .    by akopyan s opinion",
    "this is the _ euler line _ of the triangle and thus he avoided the problem is to determination of the connection among the three important classical centers of the triangle .",
    "our aim to give some analytic determination for the pseudo - centers introduced by akopyan .",
    "let @xmath333 be the feet of the pseudo - medians .",
    "then we have the following formulas : @xmath334 implying that they are concurrent in a point @xmath331 .",
    "we call @xmath331 the _ pseudo - centroid _ of the triangle .",
    "the triangular coordinates of the pseudo - centroid hold : @xmath335    we know that @xmath99 ( 15 ) says that @xmath336 and we also have @xmath337 from these equalities we get the analogous of the spherical cagnoli s theorem : @xmath338 but @xmath339 @xmath340 @xmath341 implying ( with the above manner ) the equality @xmath342 from these equalities we get that @xmath343 thus if the area of a triangle and one of its angles be given , the product of the semi hyperbolic tangents of the containing sides is given . since the area of the examined triangles are equals to each other we get that @xmath344 @xmath345 and similarly @xmath346 implying that @xmath347 from this we get that @xmath348 as we stated in ( 55 ) .",
    "the product of the equalities in ( 55 ) gives the equality @xmath349 on the other hand the triangles @xmath350 , @xmath351 having equal areas and also have a common angle , in virtue of ( 67 ) we get that @xmath352 implying that @xmath353 so we also have @xmath354 and as a consequence the equality @xmath355 menelaos theorem now gives the existence of the pseudo - centroid .    from ( 55 )",
    "we get that @xmath356 hence @xmath357 or equivalently @xmath358 from this we get @xmath359 @xmath360 @xmath361 thus @xmath362 @xmath363 hence we also have @xmath364 implying that @xmath365 @xmath366 @xmath367 @xmath368 from this we get that @xmath369 @xmath370 similarly we get @xmath371 @xmath372 as we stated in ( 56 ) .",
    "we note that there are many euclidean theorems can be investigated on the hyperbolic plane by our more - less trigonometric way .",
    "we note that on the hyperbolic plane the usual isoptic property of the circle lost ( see @xcite ) and thus all the euclidean statements using this property can be investigated only the way of @xcite . to",
    "that we can use trigonometry in this method we can concentrate on the introduced concept of angle sums which in a trigonometric calculation can be handed well .",
