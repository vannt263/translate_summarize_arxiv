    "( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity is of physical interest as a toy model for the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional case .",
    "it is used as a testing ground which allows one to investigate conceptual questions arising in the quantisation of gravity without being hindered by the technical complexity in higher dimensions .",
    "one of these questions is the problem of `` quantising geometry '' or , more concretely , the problem of recovering geometrical objects with a clear physical interpretation from the gauge theory - like formulations used as a starting point for quantisation .    in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , the relation between einstein s theory of gravity and gauge theory is more direct than in higher dimensional cases , since the theory takes the form of a chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "depending on the value of the cosmological constant , vacuum solutions of einstein s equations of motion are flat or of constant curvature .",
    "the theory has only a finite number of physical degrees of freedom arising from the matter content and topology of the spacetime .",
    "this absence of local gravitational degrees of freedom manifests itself mathematically in the possibility to formulate the theory as a chern - simons gauge theory @xcite where the gauge group is the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional poincar group @xmath6 , the group @xmath7 or @xmath8 , respectively , for cosmological constant @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the main advantage of the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity is that it allows one to apply gauge theoretical concepts and methods which give rise to an efficient description of phase space and poisson structure . as einstein s equations of motion",
    "take the form of a flatness condition on the gauge field , physical states can be characterised by holonomies , and conjugation invariant functions of the holonomies form a complete set of physical observables .",
    "starting with the work of nelson and regge @xcite , martin @xcite and of ashtekar , husain , rovelli , samuel and smolin @xcite , the description of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity in terms of holonomies and the associated gauge invariant observables has proven useful in clarifying the structure of its classical phase space as well as in quantisation .",
    "an overview of different approaches and results is given in @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it makes it difficult to recover the geometrical picture of a spacetime manifold and thereby complicates the physical interpretation of the theory . except for cases",
    "where the holonomies take a particularly simple form such as static spacetimes and the torus universe , it is in general not obvious how the description of the phase space in terms of holonomies and associated gauge invariant observables gives rise to a lorentz metric on a spacetime manifold .",
    "the first to address this problem for general spacetimes was mess @xcite , who showed how the geometry of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes can be reconstructed from a set of holonomies . more recent results on this problem are obtained in the papers by benedetti and guadagnini @xcite and by benedetti and bonsante @xcite , which are going to be our main references .",
    "they describe the construction of evolving spacetimes from static ones via the geometrical procedure of grafting , which , essentially , consists of inserting small annuli along certain geodesics of the spacetime . as they establish a unified picture for all values of the cosmological constant and",
    "show how this change of geometry affects the holonomies , they clarify the relation between holonomies and spacetime geometry considerably .",
    "however , despite these results , the problem of relating spacetime geometry and the description of phase space and poisson structure in terms of holonomies has not yet been fully solved .",
    "the missing link is the role of the poisson structure .",
    "a complete understanding of the gauge invariant observables must include a physical interpretation of the transformations on phase space they generate via the poisson bracket .",
    "conversely , to interpret the geometrical construction of evolving ( 2 + 1)-spacetimes via grafting as a physical transformation , one needs to determine how it affects phase space and poisson structure .",
    "this paper addresses these questions for ( 2 + 1)-gravity with vanishing cosmological constant on manifolds of topology @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an orientable two - surface of genus @xmath2 .",
    "it relates the construction of evolving ( 2 + 1)-spacetimes via grafting along simple , closed curves to the description of the phase space in terms of holonomies and the associated gauge invariant observables .",
    "the main results can be stated as follows .    1 .",
    "we show how grafting along a closed , simple geodesic is implemented in the chern - simons formulation of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity . using the parametrisation of the phase space in terms of holonomies given in @xcite",
    ", we deduce explicit expressions for the action of grafting on the holonomies of general curves on @xmath1 and investigate its properties as a transformation on phase space .",
    "we derive the hamiltonian that generates this grafting transformation via the poisson bracket .",
    "this hamiltonian is one of the two basic gauge invariant observables associated to a closed curve on @xmath1 and obtained from the lorentz component of its holonomy .",
    "we demonstrate that there is a symmetry relation between the transformation of the observables associated to a curve @xmath12 under grafting along @xmath3 and the transformation of the corresponding observables for @xmath3 under grafting along @xmath12 .",
    "infinitesimally , this relation takes the form of a general identity for the poisson brackets of certain observables associated to the two curves .",
    "we show that the action of grafting in our description of the phase space is closely related to the action of ( infinitesimal ) dehn twists investigated in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "essentially , grafting can be viewed as a dehn twist with a formal parameter @xmath4 satisfying @xmath5 .",
