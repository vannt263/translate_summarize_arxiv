    "for more than 50 years , astronomers have searched the skies for artificial signals and other signs of extraterrestrial civilizations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , yet no evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth has so far emerged",
    ". one viable explanation , among the many proposed for this so - called fermi paradox ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that technologically advanced civilizations are very rare .",
    "most seti efforts have so far been limited to the confines of the milky way , and with @xmath3 large galaxies in the observable universe @xcite , it has been argued that the prospects of detection may be better if the search radius is extended to extragalactic scales .",
    "the transmission of signals across extragalactic distances would be far more challenging than across a single galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite for a proposed technique of this type ) , but extremely advanced supercivilizations ( kardashev type ii - iii ; @xcite ) could in principle be detectable through indirect signatures of galactic - scale astroengineering projects even if they have no interest in intentionally transmitting signals in our direction .",
    "one potential way to harvest the radiation energy of a star is the construction of a dyson sphere @xcite , which would either completely or partially enshroud the star and make a significant fraction of radiation energy available for supercomputing or other project with immense power requirements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this would render the star unusually faint or completely dark at ultraviolet / optical wavelengths , but could make it bright at infrared wavelengths due to the need to get rid of excess heat .",
    "several unsuccessful searches for individual dyson spheres within the milky way have already been carried out .    in a pioneering study , @xcite proposed the use of galaxy scaling relations to single out potential kardashev type iii candidates , i.e. galaxies in which an extremely advanced civilization has spread throughout its host galaxy and converted vast numbers of stars into dyson spheres .",
    "as such galaxy - scale astroengineering projects would likely not affect the gravitational potential of the galaxy , but substantially decrease the total optical luminosity , host galaxies of kardashev type iii civilizations may appear anomalously underluminous for their type . in a sample of 57 disk galaxies and 106 ellipticals ,",
    "@xcite detected no significant outliers . here",
    ", we revisit the @xcite method and apply it to a tully - fisher sample of 1359 disk galaxies .",
    "the search method , the detected tully - fisher outliers and the resulting upper limits on the prevalence of star - fed kardashev type iii civilizations in disk galaxies are discussed in sect .  [ constraints ] . in sect .",
    "[ nature ] , the nature of the outliers is probed further using morphological information and infrared data .",
    "other potential signatures of supercivilizations that make use of dyson spheres on large scales are discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "[ summary ] summarizes our findings .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is an empirical relation between the velocity width ( amplitude of the rotation curve ) of a spiral galaxy and its absolute magnitude . because of the low scatter in this relation",
    ", it is often used as a distance indicator : by combining an apparent magnitude derived from photometry with a spectroscopic measurement of the velocity width ( usually based on the hi 21 cm line or the h@xmath4 line at 6563  ) , it becomes possible to infer the distance by adopting the absolute magnitude predicted by the relation .",
    "the tully - fisher relation has been shown to hold for rotationally supported galaxies over an impression range in surface brightness and luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there are indications of increased scatter and a systematic change in slope for the faintest and smallest galaxies @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , galaxy - wide colonization projects in which large numbers of stars are converted into dyson spheres would affect the absolute magnitude in short - wavelength passbands , but are not likely to affect the velocity width , which serves as a proxy for the depth of the gravitational well .",
    "the host galaxies of star - fed kardashev type iii ( hereafter kiii ) civilizations should therefore appear significantly underluminous compared to the optical tully - fisher ( hereafter tf ) relation . in search of kiii",
    "host galaxy candidates , @xcite adopted the criterion that such objects should have their optical luminosity dimmed by at least a factor of four ( i.e. 1.5 magnitudes ) compared to the tf relation , and analyzed a sample of 57 disk galaxies from without finding any tf outliers according to this criterion . here , we apply the same technique to tf data ( luminosity in the @xmath5-band and velocity width @xmath6 based on either the hi 21 cm line or h@xmath4 ) for @xmath0 objects from the @xcite sfi++ catalog .    the criterion that kiii galaxy candidates",
    "should be located @xmath7 mag below the tf is simply chosen for convenience  the tf relation has an intrinsic scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that , when coupled to observational errors would lead to too many spurious detections if the limit had been placed closer to the tf .",
    "the baryonic tf @xcite exhibits smaller intrinsic scatter and could potentially be used to search for less extreme kiii objects , but this requires additional data for each object ( an estimate of the molecular gas fraction ) , and current baryonic tf samples are consequently much smaller .",
    "objects located significantly more than 1.5 mag below the tf become increasingly likely to be excluded from existing tf samples due to selection effects ( which we attempt to quantify in sect .",
    "[ statistics ] ) . for these reasons",
    ", we have chosen to stick to the @xmath7 mag criterion used by @xcite . using the parsec v1.2s isochrones @xcite ,",
    "as implemented in the cmd spectral synthesis code , we estimate that 40 - 50% of the stellar contribution to the @xmath5-band flux of galaxies that have undergone active star formation for @xmath8 gyr comes from main - sequence stars , whereas the remaining fraction comes from more evolved stars ( red giants , horizontal branch stars , asymptotic giant stars ) .",
    "hence , a very wide range of stars would need to be enshrouded in close - to - complete dyson spheres in order for kiii civilizations to be detectable with the tf method .",
    "below , we present a brief overview of how the tf data in the sfi++ catalog was originally derived .",
    "further pruning and modifications of this catalog for the purposes of our kiii search are described in sect .",
    "[ peculiar ] .    in the @xcite data set ,",
    "@xmath6 is either derived from spectroscopy of the hi 21 cm line or from optical h@xmath4 rotation curves . in the hi case ( the most common case for the tf outliers we find ) , springob et al derive the line width @xmath9 using : @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the observed line width of the hi 21 cm line , @xmath12 the redshift ( based on the wavelength of either the hi 21 cm line or the wavelength of h@xmath4 ) , @xmath13 the inclination , @xmath14 the instrumental correction to the line width and @xmath15 the corresponding turbulence correction . in the case of @xmath15 ,",
    "a value of 6.5 km s@xmath16 was adopted . for a detailed description of the instrumental line width correction @xmath15 , see @xcite .    in the case when optical rotation curves are used in sfi++",
    ", corrections are applied for known systematic differences between h@xmath4 and hi velocity widths due to the limited extent of the h@xmath4 data .",
    "the inclinations used to correct @xmath6 for orientation effects in the catalog is derived using @xmath17 here , @xmath18 represents the semimajor axis , @xmath19 the semiminor axis , @xmath20 the intrinsic axial ratio @xmath21 of the disk at edge - on orientation , assumed to be @xmath22 for disks of morphological type sbc and later , and 0.20 for disks of earlier morphological types .",
    "the @xmath5-band absolute magnitudes of sfi++ have been corrected for internal dust attenuation by an amount @xmath23 given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is taken to be a function of @xmath26 ( with high - luminosity disks assumed to display higher dust attenuation ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the data have also been corrected for galactic extinction using cobe data @xcite .",
    "pinning down the factors that dominate the error budget on the position of an object in the tf diagram is highly nontrivial , given the many measurements and corrections involved , but @xcite attempt such an analysis for a subset of the sfi++ data .",
    "they find that the errors and corrections on the velocity width tend to dominate , except in the case of high - width , high - luminosity , highly inclined galaxies , for which errors on the extinction correction ( eq .",
    "[ extinction_eq ] ) can become the main source of uncertainty .",
    "the median correction for dust in our sample is @xmath27 mag , but in extreme cases , the correction does reach @xmath28 mag .",
    "errors on photometry , redshift and ellipticity are typically negligble by comparison .",
    "of course , this holds for normal galaxies , absent kiii activity .",
    "the sensitivity of the dust correction to the optical axial ratio @xmath29 could in principle jeopardize the assumption that dysonian astroengineering should affect the optical stellar luminosity ( as measured by @xmath26 ) , while leaving the overall dynamics and the gas phase ( as measured by @xmath6 ) untouched .",
    "if kiii activity results in morphological curiosities which affect the apparent @xmath29 ratio , then this could affect both @xmath26 and @xmath6 , through the inclination - related corrections going into both eq.([w21_eq ] ) and eq.([extinction_eq ] ) .",
    "based on the numerical simulations of kiii colonization presented in sect .",
    "[ simulations ] , we argue that this effect can go both ways , and act to either accentuate or mask kiii activity in the tf diagram .",
    "an evenly colonized kiii disk with uniformly diminished surface brightness may appear rounder than it actually is ( due to a spuriously high @xmath21 ) , since only the inner , bulge - dominated parts may remain visible above the surface brightness threshold in optical images .",
    "such objects would be pushed towards the lower right of the tf diagram ( deeper into the kiii candidate region ) , since @xmath6 would be biased high and the dust correction on @xmath26 would be underestimated .",
    "an already highly inclined galaxy in which kiii colonization has focused on the bulge - dominated inner regions may on the other hand appear flatter than it actually is ( due to a spuriously low @xmath21 ) , thereby pushing it upwards ( towards the tf line and away from the kiii region ) .",
    "this sensitivity to how kiii colonization has progressed within a galaxy is an inherent limitation of the tf approach to kiii searches , as long as the axial ratio is based on the optical appearance , and should be kept in mind as a possible caveat when considering the tf - based limits on astroengineered disks we derive in sect .",
    "[ statistics ] .      in the original sfi++ catalog , distances ( in velocity units ) to galaxies not belonging to any group or cluster are estimated using the relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the velocity in the cmb frame and @xmath32 the peculiar velocity expressed as @xmath33 here , @xmath34 represents the difference between the attenuation - corrected absolute magnitude ( as presented in the sfi++ catalog ) and the predicted absolute magnitude one would expect if the object had no offset from the tf relation .    however , since we are specifically looking for tf outliers , distances based on the assumption that a single object lies on the tf are of little use . for objects belonging to galaxy groups or clusters containing several disk galaxies with individual tf distances , the average distance to the group or cluster itself may still be used as an estimate of the distance to the member galaxies .    in our analysis",
    ", we therefore discard all field galaxies from the sample and estimate new absolute magnitudes @xmath26 for the remaining objects based on the sfi++ distances assigned to the groups and clusters to which they are deemed to belong .    in @xcite , such group and cluster distances",
    "are estimated similar to eq .",
    "( [ distance_eq ] ) , but with @xmath35 calculated as the mean redshift of all group members and peculiar velocities estimated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is calculated similar to eq .",
    "( [ velocity_eq ] ) , with the slight difference of using @xmath35 instead of @xmath31 for individual galaxies . here",
    "@xmath38 represents the estimated error on @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite also present a version of @xmath39 corrected for malmqvist bias , @xmath40 ( distance in velocity units ) , and this is the quantity we use to recompute the absolute magnitudes : @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the @xmath5-band apparent magnitude corrected for both internal and galactic extinction and @xmath43 is the hubble constant . to be consistent with the luminosity - dependent extinction correction scheme derived by @xcite and adopted by @xcite ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath44 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 when computing the extinction corrections , but have then rescaled all absolute magnitudes to @xmath45 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , which is more in line with modern measurements of the hubble parameter .",
    "one should note that the extinction correction scheme derived by @xcite was based mainly on sbc and sc galaxies , whereas sfi++ contains a greater diversity of spiral subclasses .",
    "@xcite argue that , because of this , extinction in earlier types may possibly be underestimated",
    ". however , this turns out to be of little consequence for the present study , since very few sa galaxies end up as kiii candidates ( see sect .",
    "[ nature ] for more discussion on sa subtypes ) .",
    "the underlying assumption when giving preference to group distances over the distances to individual objects given in sfi++ is that star - fed kiii civilizations are relatively rare ( as already indicated by the studies of @xcite and @xcite ) , so that even though a single group / cluster member may be a tf outlier , the tf distance to the group / cluster as a whole need not be significantly biased . in the case of a colonization wave spreading across intergalactic distances from one galaxy to the next",
    ", this assumption may of course be jeopardized , as further discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "a second caveat is that , since groups / clusters can have non - negligible extent along the line of sight , the distance to a member galaxy may be somewhat different from the distance to the group / cluster centre .    after rejecting field galaxies from sfi++",
    ", we further prune the sample by removing galaxies belonging to groups and clusters with less than 3 sfi++ members , since too large distance errors would otherwise be introuced ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ reliability ] ) . out of 4861 galaxies in the full sfi++ catalog , our remaining subsample consists of 1359 objects .",
    "our scheme for reassessing absolute magnitudes for group and cluster members then generates a sample of 11 galaxies seemingly located @xmath7 mag below the tf relation , which thereby qualify as kiii candidates according to the @xcite criterion .",
    "the properties of these galaxies are summarized in table  [ kiii_candidates ] .",
    "as it turns out , our 11 kiii candidates all belong to the so - called nontemplate groups of the sfi++ catalog , i.e. groups of galaxies with relatively few other sfi++ members @xcite .",
    "as the exact spatial sizes of the groups defined by @xcite are not known , we introduce an uncertainty on the absolute magnitudes by assigning each group an estimated radius of 1.5 mpc . assuming this to be the outer edge that confines the group , we calculate the absolute magnitude that our objects would have at this distance and adopt the difference between the central and edge magnitude as the uncertainty . as a result",
    ", the uncertainty in absolute magnitude consequently grows with decreasing group distance ( reaching a maximum of @xmath46 mag for the most nearby object in table  [ kiii_candidates ] ) . in order to include uncertainties from extinction and inclination we also add the error of the absolute magnitude tabulated by @xcite to the total error budget .",
    "one of the risks involved in deriving absolute magnitudes for galaxies based on the tf distances to their parent groups , is that this may result in spurious kiii candidates in situations where background galaxies have been incorrectly assigned to foreground groups .",
    "this leads to underestimated galaxy distances and therefore absolute magnitudes that are much too faint .",
    "a potential indication of this is when the redshifts of faint outliers appear to be significantly higher than those of the groups hosting them .",
    "peculiar motions may account for some of these offsets , but for four cases in table  [ kiii_candidates ] ( objects 1 , 2 , 9 and 10 ) , the differences between the observed galaxy redshifts @xmath47 and the group distances @xmath48 correspond to velocity offsets of more than 3000 km s@xmath16 , which seems extremely high .",
    "however , scrutiny of the sfi++ catalog entries reveals that the observed redshifts of these four galaxies agree well with the average group redshifts , and that it is the group tf distances @xmath48 themselves that are dubious .",
    "these four outliers belong to two small groups with only three tf members each . in both cases",
    ", the third member happens to be a low - mass galaxy ( @xmath49 ) with very high luminosity ( @xmath50 magnitudes above the tf relation ) .",
    "hence , the inferred tf distances to these groups seem to be biased by small number statistics and tf outliers , albeit outliers in the opposite sense of what we are looking for .    since the adopted distances to the groups hosting our kiii candidates are sensitive to the number of other tf galaxies in these structures , groups with many tf members are in general expected to have more reliable distance estimates than those with few members .",
    "the 11 outliers in table  [ kiii_candidates ] are part of 7 groups , where the smallest ones are the groups with sfi++ identifiers 40702 , 30590 and 31043 ( 3 members each in the sfi++ catalog ) and group 40032 , ( 4 members ) .",
    "the largest groups are group 30654 with 29 members , group 1736 with 10 and",
    "group 3407 with a total of 8 members . here",
    ", we have assigned a default class b to candidates with only 3 tf members , as these are more prone to errors , and class a to groups with @xmath51 members . because of the clear - cut problems with the groups hosting objects 1 , 2 , 9 and 10 , these are further degraded from class b to c , and are deemed to be the least likely kiii candidates in table  [ kiii_candidates ] .",
    "when comparing the offsets between observed galaxy redshifts and the mean redshifts of their parent groups , objects 5 and 8 also stand out , with velocity offsets of @xmath52 km s@xmath16 and @xmath53 km s@xmath16 respectively",
    ". since these are members of the two largest groups , with sfi++ velocity dispersions similar to or larger than these offsets , this is by itself not a source of concern .",
    "however , in the case of object 8 , which would belong to class a according to our criteria , we suspect that there is something wrong with the data or the catalog entry , since @xcite lists an apparent magnitude corrected for inclination and extinction that is _ fainter _ than the uncorrected observed magnitude , which is unphysical .",
    "this objects has therefore also been transfered to class b.    outliers of class a , b and c are marked in fig .",
    "[ tf_figure ] as blue , green and red symbols respectively .",
    "as seen , the outliers with the least reliable distance estimates ( class c ) are the ones with the most extreme offsets from the tf relation , whereas objects belonging to class a and b straddle the kiii delimiter line .",
    "it should be noted that the present analysis is insensitive to extreme kiii objects , for which @xmath54 of the optical light has been absorbed by dyson spheres ( i.e. galaxies located @xmath55 mag below the tf ) , since such disks would not make it into the sfi++ sample in the first place .",
    "a number of such `` dark galaxy '' candidates , with very faint or undetected optical counterparts , have already been uncovered in blind hi sureys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of these have very low masses and velocity widths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are therefore in the region where the tf already is known to exhibit considerable scatter @xcite . whether there are massive dark galaxies remains an open question  while such detections have been claimed @xcite , it has also been argued that these could simply be tidal hi structures with extended hi line profiles without ordered rotation .    , with error bars suppressed for all objects except the kiii candidates to avoid cluttering .",
    "the solid line indicates the tf relation and the dashed line the limit below which outliers qualify as kiii candidates according to the @xcite criterion .",
    "numbered dots mark the 11 outliers discussed in the text , with blue indicating the kiii candidiates of class a , green indicating class b and red indicating class c. some of the errorbars have been slightly exaggerated for plotting purposes.,width=317 ]      it is important to realize that a substantial fraction of galaxies in the sfi++ compilation would likely have been excluded from the sample , had they been converted into kiii objects , as this would have rendered them too faint for detection or otherwise altered their properties in ways that would have prevented them from entering the catalog .",
    "in fact , the prospects of finding kiii candidates quickly deteriorate as the condition of tf offset @xmath56 is sharpened . the method becomes far less efficient at @xmath57 mag ( 90% of light absorbed ) than for @xmath58 mag ( 75% of light absorbed ; our default limit ) , and fails to produce any useful results at @xmath59 mag ( 99% of light absorbed ) .    to convert our harvest of seemingly underluminous disk galaxies into a constraint on the prevalence of star - fed kiii civilizations in disk galaxies , we need to quantify",
    "the fraction of objects that would _ not _ have been detectable at a given @xmath56 .",
    "however , this become highly non - trivial because of the inhomogeneous selection criteria used in the @xcite compilation .",
    "a casual upper limit can nonetheless be derived from the effective surface brightness limit of the sfi++ sample . by considering the size - flux distribution of objects in the catalog",
    ", we find that kiii - colonized galaxies that end up with a mean @xmath5-band surface brigthness within the outermost detected @xmath5-band isophote @xmath60 mag arcsec@xmath61 are likely to be too faint for detection . to estimate the fraction of kiii candidates that would have been excluded for this reason , we assume that kiii colonization causes a uniform dimming of the disk , and hence a rescaling of the entire surface brightness profile while leaving its overall slope unaltered ( see sect .  [ simulations ] for a discussion on this ) . in this case ,",
    "kiii colonization makes @xmath62 fainter , but also makes the galaxy appear smaller , since the faintest detectable isophote is reached at a smaller distance from the centre .",
    "the latter effect is important , since some of the subsamples of the sfi++ compilation are based on optical size constraints , which may reject small kiii galaxies even if they are sufficiently bright to be observed .    to simulate these selection effects",
    ", we fit exponential disk profiles to all of the 1359 objects in the sfi++ catalog for which the relevant photometric data is available ( about 80% of the objects ) .",
    "we then lower the surface brightness uniformly by a constant factor ( @xmath56 ) , derive the radius of the outermost detectable isophote @xmath63 and the mean surface brightness @xmath62 within this radius .",
    "based on the apparent surface brightness limits of the sample , and strict size limits for some of the subsamples in the sfi++ compilation , we consider object likely to be rejected from the sample if @xmath60 mag arcsec@xmath61 or @xmath64 arcsec . through this procedure , we find that @xmath65 , or @xmath66 objects would likely have remained detectable after 1.5 mag of dimming ( 75% of the light lost )",
    ". given 11 candidates out of a sample of 400 , one may then conservatively conclude that @xmath1 of local disk galaxies are housing star - fed kiii civilizations .",
    "these estimates also reveals the limitations of the method  only 16% , 9% and 3% of the objects in the sample would have been detectable at @xmath56=2.1 mag , 2.5 and 3.25 mag ( 85% , 90% and 95% of light absorbed lost ) . at 99%",
    "dimming , no objects would remain detectable .    for the sample of disk galaxies used by @xcite",
    ", one may derive a corresponding limit by considering the apparent magnitude limit at which incompleteness effects set in . following the discussion in , we adopt a completeness limit at @xmath67 , and argue that @xmath68 out of the 57 disk galaxies ( i.e @xmath65 ) used by @xcite are sufficiently bright to have been included in the sample even if they had been dimmed by 1.5 mag . by using the photometric data from the sfi++ compilation for the subset of the @xcite disk galaxies ( 43 objects ) that are included in sfi++ , we can aslo perform a completion analysis based on surface brightness similar to that used above for our own sample .",
    "this suggests that a slightly larger fraction ( @xmath69 ) of the @xcite disks may remain detectable after 1.5 mag of dimming .",
    "hence , the non - detection of kiii candidates reported by @xcite converts into a @xmath704@xmath71 upper limit on the prevalence of kiiis in disk galaxies .",
    "this means that , due to the existence of the apparent outlier population shown in fig .",
    "[ tf_figure ] , our upper limit on the prevalence of star - fed kiii civilizations in disk galaxies is _ at most _ a factor of @xmath72 times stronger than that inferred from the original @xcite study ( @xmath73 for our sample compared to @xmath74@xmath71 for the annis sample ) , despite the fact that we are analyzing a disk galaxy sample that is larger by a factor of @xmath75 . as discussed in sect .  [ reliability ] , many of the outliers we find are likely to be due to inaccurate distances , and this is an effect that will plague all large tf surveys  the @xcite approach , with focus on just a single , well - defined cluster , provides a cleaner sample in this respect .",
    "the presence of a small fraction of disk galaxies that may appear underluminous due to low star formation activity or unusually high dust content just compounds the problem .",
    "applying the tf method to even larger samples may therefore not do much to improve the upper limits on the kiii civilizations , unless auxiliary data allows for stronger constraints on the nature of the outliers .    in sect .",
    "[ nature ] , we discuss the use of morphological information and infrared data to further probe the kiii status of our tf outliers . as none of our 11 tf outliers stand out as strong kiii candidates based on these additional tests , we may tentatively conclude that a fraction @xmath76 ( i.e. @xmath2 ) of disk galaxies host star - fed kiii civilizations ( i.e. a constraint 1020 times stronger than that of @xcite ) , based on the assumption that none of the 11 candidates are bona fide kiii objects .",

    "as dyson spheres are expected to lower the @xmath5-band luminosities and boost the mid / far - infrared luminosities of stars , one naively expects the @xmath80 and/or the @xmath77 ratio of a galaxy to grow substantially when a large fraction of its stars are subject this form of astroengineering .",
    "since these ratios are independent of distance , they are not affected by any lingering distance errors in the tf analysis ( sect .  [ reliability ] ) .",
    "one caveat is that if the dyson spheres operate at a very low temperature ( @xmath81 k ) , the excess heat radiation would mostly affect wavelengths longward of 22 @xmath79 m , and whatever flux boost these low - temperature dyson spheres may contribute at 22 @xmath79 m could in principle be offset by a drop in the mundane 22 @xmath79 m dust radiation as stars that under normal circumstances keep this dust heated are enshrouded in dyson spheres .",
    "the second problem is that the intrinsic scatter among disks in @xmath82 luminosity ratios amounts to a factor of @xmath83 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that  without detailed spectral synthesis modelling  a truly extreme ir excess is required to stand out .    as seen in table  [ ir_excess ] ,",
    "@xmath80 varies by a factor of @xmath84 and @xmath77 by a factor of @xmath85 among our candidates , with the most extreme objects reaching @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , a similar analysis of @xcite disks with more typical @xmath5-band luminosities with respect to the tf relation indicates that such objects occasionally also attain @xmath80 and @xmath77 ratios this high .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnoff test rejects ( at 5% significance ) the hypothesis that the @xmath80 and @xmath77 distributions of our kiii candidates is drawn from the same parent population as a random sample of disks from the @xcite catalog .",
    "however , this is primarily due to an excess of objects with _ very low _ ir - to - optical flux ratios in our kiii candidate sample ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) , i.e. objects with ratios of a kind _ not _ expected from bona fide kiii host galaxies .    to explore whether the mid - ir spectra of our kiii candidates shows some other interesting anomalies ,",
    "we have plotted these objects into the @xmath90 vs. @xmath91 color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ ir_fig ] ) , with a few of the diagnostic regions from @xcite superposed . due to a lack of reliable 12 @xmath79 m data for one ( object 3 ) ,",
    "only 10 objects are included in this figure .",
    "most of these kiii candidates fall in the region occupied by disk galaxies , which indicates that their mid - ir flux ratios in these wise passbands are normal for objects of this type . however , one of the kiii candidates ( object 6 ) is located close to the region typically inhabited by elliptical galaxies , where stellar continuum rather than dust emission dominate the wise fluxes . since this object has a fairly low @xmath80 ratio and a very low @xmath77 ratio , it is _ not _ a strong kiii candidate based on its ir properties .",
    "instead , a possible explanation for both its anomalously low @xmath5-band luminosity and lack of pronounced dust emission is that star formation has been quenched in this disk galaxy , thereby effectively shutting off dust heating by massive stars and allowing the rayleigh - jeans tail of the stellar radiation to dominate the wise bands .",
    "indeed , this interpretation is supported by the analysis by , which classify it as `` anemic '' based on the extremely low equivalent width of its h@xmath4 emission line .",
    "three of the candidates ( objects 9 , 10 and 11 ) are located in the part of the spiral galaxy region also occupied by luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , and two of these ( objects 9 and 11 ) are also the ones with the highest @xmath77 ratios . out of these , only object 9 has ir data at longer wavelengths ( iras ; 12100 @xmath79 m ) .",
    "this candidate is not a lirg according to the standard defintion ( @xmath92 ) , but it does have a very high ir - to - optical luminosity ratio for its type ( total ir to b - band ratio @xmath93 compared to @xmath94 for a typical sb galaxy ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , other disk galaxies with equally extreme ratios are known @xcite .    despite the complications in predicting the exact seds of kiii galaxies ,",
    "one may still set lower limits on the expected @xmath80 and @xmath77 ratios by adopting the very conservative assumption that _ only _ the @xmath5-band luminosity is absorbed by dyson spheres , and that this is re - radiated as a single - temperature black body . in the case of black body dyson spheres of temperature @xmath95 , 100 , 300 600 k , a 1.5 mag decrement in the @xmath5-band results in minimum luminosity ratios of @xmath96 , 800 , 850 and 210 .",
    "for @xmath97 , 600 and 1000 k black bodies , @xmath98 , 120 and 140 , respectively .",
    "these lower limits already rule out most of the objects in table  [ ir_excess ] as kiii candidates with single - temperature dyson spheres in the @xmath99 k range .",
    "a detailed comparison reveals that @xmath1001200 k dyson spheres are ruled out for _ all _ candidates based on the @xmath80 ratios , and that 75800 k dyson spheres are ruled out for all but objects 9 and 11 based on the @xmath77 ratios .",
    "the data in table  [ ir_excess ] would make object 9 consistent with kiii activity under the assumption of dyson spheres operating at very low temperatures ( @xmath101 k ) .",
    "however , since this object belongs to class c due to a dubious distance estimate ( see sect .  [ constraints ] ) , we do not considered it a strong kiii candidate .",
    "this leaves object 11 , which has the highest @xmath77 and @xmath80 ratios among our kiii candidates ( consistent with kiii activity in the case of @xmath102 k dyson sphere , under the very conservative assumption that only the i - band flux is absorbed ) and has a redshift without any siginficant velocity offset from that of its the parent group .",
    "however , the fact that this object straddles the kiii candidate delimiter line ( fig .  [ tf_figure ] ) makes its candidate status sensitive to the details of how the extinction corrections are made .",
    "our luminosity - dependent extinction corrections differ somewhat from those tabulated in the sfi++ catalog ( due to slight differences in the way distances are assigned ) , and while this difference is in general very small ( on average @xmath103 mag throughout our sample and insignificant for the kiii candidate status of the other 10 objects in table  [ kiii_candidates ] ) , the discrepancy for this particular object happens to be to sufficient to push it @xmath27 mag closer to the tf if the original sfi++ correction is used . while hardly a strong kiii candidate , this is still the most interesting object uncovered in our search , and could be an interesting target for follow - up observations .     vs. @xmath91 color - color diagram for the 10 of our kiii candidates with wise detections in these passbands .",
    "the objects have been labeled according to their numbers in table  [ kiii_candidates ] .",
    "the colored patches mark the regions typically inhabited by ellipticals , disks and luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) according to @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the error bars on the measured colors are smaller than the symbols used.,width=317 ]",
    "without knowing what an extremely advanced civilization would use the energy collected from large numbers of dyson spheres for , it is difficult to judge whether this type of astroengineering project would be allowed to grow indefinitely , or cease once some desired energy requirements have been met .",
    "if the purpose is to harvest energy to drive supercomputers @xcite the long communication times between distant dyson spheres may eventually make further expansion of this type of dysonian colonization unattractive .",
    "civilizations that cease their colonization efforts early in the transition stage from kardashev type ii to iii would not be singled out using the @xcite kiii criterion ( which requires that 75% of the optical light has been absorbed ) , but could potentially still be detectable in nearby , well - resolved galaxies .",
    "@xcite argue that regions within such galaxies where large numbers of stars have been converted into dyson spheres would appear as dark patches in high - resolution optical images . as discussion in sect .",
    "[ simulations ] , large ( kpc - scale ) patches of this type would only survive over cosmological time scales under very special circumstances .",
    "however , a gravitationally bound star cluster subject to astroengineering could retain its dysonian signatures for billions of years .",
    "even though optical dimming coupled to an ir excess superficially mimics the effects of dust attenuation , dysonian astroengineering projects may still give rise to quantitative anomalies in integrated uv / optical / ir colors or spectra of such objects , that would be different from those produced by standard dust attenuation curves .",
    "this is especially true if only a subset of stellar types are targeted by astroengineering projects .",
    "if dysonian astroengineering ambitions remain firm over time and are not hindered by scale , the colonization wave may in principle spread beyond the boundaries of its galaxy of origin .",
    "outline various schemes through which von neumann probes may spread to large number of galaxies over cosmological time scales .",
    "this provides another opportunity to confirm the status of kiii candidates ",
    "if neighbouring galaxies would also appear anomalously dim , this would constitute supporting evidence for astroengineering .",
    "promising methods to investigate this may be to study the luminosity functions of dwarf galaxies in the vicinity of kiii candidates . in cases where the kiii candidate happens to be located close to another large disk or elliptical galaxy , a tully - fisher or fundamental plane analysis @xcite would be very interesting .",
    "indeed , several of the kiii candidates in table  [ kiii_candidates ] belong to the same galaxy group . among objects in the a category ( indicating that the group has @xmath51 members in the catalog and therefore a more reliable tf distance to the group centre ) , this is the case for objects 57 .",
    "however , these objects also happen to belong to the most nearby group featured in table  [ kiii_candidates ] ( among the 3% of groups with the lowest inferred distances in the @xcite catalog ) , which makes the distance of individual galaxies from the group centre a significant error source . without independent ( i.e. non tf - based ) distance estimates to the individual galaxies in the groups containing several kiii candidates , we are unable to assess how distant these galaxies really are from one another .",
    "by searching a tully - fisher sample of @xmath104 disk galaxies for the dysonian astroengineering signatures expected from kardashev type iii civilizations , we are able to set a conservative upper limit of @xmath1 on the fraction of local disks that meet the @xcite criteria for such civilizations . in this sample ,",
    "a total of 11 objects are found to be significantly underluminous ( by a factor of 4 in the @xmath5-band ) compared to the tully - fisher relation , and therefore qualify as kardashev type iii host galaxy candidates according to this test .",
    "however , by scrutinizing the optical morphologies and wise 3.422 @xmath79 m infrared fluxes of these objects , we find nothing that strongly supports the astroengineering interpretation of their unusually low optical luminosities .",
    "hence , we conclude that their apparent positions in the tully - fisher diagram likely have mundane causes , with underestimated distances being the most probable explanation for most of the candidates . under the assumption that none of them are bona fide kiii objects",
    ", we set a tentative upper limit of @xmath2 on the fraction of disk galaxies harbouring kiii civilizations .",
