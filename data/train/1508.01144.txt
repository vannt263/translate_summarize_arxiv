    "positronium ( ps ) is a metastable leptonic atom  @xcite composed of an electron and its antiparticle , the positron .",
    "this exotic atom resembles in many ways the hydrogen atom , but with bound state energy levels appearing at half of the energies due to its reduced mass being half of the electron mass .",
    "the existence of ps was firstly postulated by mohorovicic in 1934  @xcite and finally observed in 1951 by deutsch  @xcite . as in the case of the hydrogen atom , two",
    "ps can form a molecular bound state , leading to a hydrogen - like molecule but with a leptonic nature ps@xmath5 , which was predicted in the 40 s by wheeler  @xcite , and recently observed  @xcite .",
    "different decay channels of both positronium and molecular positronium ps@xmath5 have been addressed in the framework of qed  @xcite .    just as the case with the hydrogen atom , ps possesses two different spin states , a singlet state which is called parapositronium ( p - ps ) , and the triplet state called orthopositronium ( o - ps ) . within the strict confines quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , which preserves charge conjugation symmetry",
    ", the p - ps state can only decay into an even number of photons , while o - ps decays to an odd number of photons  @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of the decay modes of ps which are allowed within pure qed , both the dominant modes as well as more exotic decay channels , have been computed  @xcite . for the dominant modes the calculations have been extended to include higher order qed radiative corrections .",
    "the inclusion of the electroweak interaction which are mediated by the exchange of the massive vector @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons allows for additional decay modes such as those involving neutrinos which are absent in pure qed analysis .",
    "for instance , o - ps can decay into two neutrinos leading to an invisible channel  @xcite which has been experimentally investigated  @xcite .",
    "however , the influence of the electroweak interaction into the decay modes of p - ps remain unexplored .    in this work",
    ", we report on the calculation of the decay mode of p - ps into a neutrino - antineutrino plus a single photon .",
    "since the neutrino pair goes undetected , this appears experimentally as a single photon decay channel .",
    "the studied decay mode involves the exchange of massive vector bosons of the electro - weak interaction and as such can not arise within pure qed .",
    "the energy of the photon emitted in this mode exhibits a continuous spectra of energy between zero and m@xmath6 .",
    "the process can shed some additional light on the influence of the electroweak interaction in leptonic bound states , as well constituting another novel decay channel for the completeness of the decay chart of ps .",
    "the annihilation of ps into a neutrino - antineutrino plus a single photon is a consequence of the electroweak interaction . through the exchange of the massive @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector bosons , the electrons and positrons comprising the positronium can produce a neutrino - antineutrino pair which can be accompanied by the emission of the photon off the incident electron or positron . to secure the single photon total rate ( here denoted by ps @xmath7 ) , we compute the contributions from each of the possible final states involving each of the three species of neutrinos ( @xmath8 ) and add the rates incoherently .",
    "for the final state containing the photon plus the @xmath9 pair , the relevant feynman diagrams with the final state photon emitted off the incident electron leg are displayed in fig .",
    "1 . in addition , there are the analogous graphs with the outgoing photon emitted from the positron line which are not displayed .",
    "the process with the @xmath10 final state includes both @xmath11-channel @xmath0 boson exchange ( fig .",
    "1a ) and @xmath12-channel @xmath1 boson exchange ( fig .",
    "in addition , the photon can also be emitted off the internal charged @xmath0 line as shown in fig . 2 , but its contribution to the amplitude is further suppressed by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the electron and @xmath0 masses respectively , and is thus neglected . for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 final states ,",
    "only the @xmath12-channel @xmath1 boson exchange displayed in fig 1b contributes . here again , there are the analogous graphs with the photon emitted off the positron line which are not explicitly displayed .",
    "the @xmath0 exchange diagram of fig .",
    "1a does not contribute in either of these cases .",
    "the energy - momentum of the incoming electron and positron are labeled as @xmath18 , @xmath19 respectively , while the outgoing neutrino and antineutrino are labeled as @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively and the emitted photon 4-momentum is denoted by @xmath22 . here",
    ", the energy - momentum vectors are represented as @xmath23 and @xmath24 1/137 is the fine structure constant .",
    "we work throughout using natural units ( @xmath25 = 1 ) . throughout the calculation ,",
    "the tiny mass of the neutrinos is neglected and they are treated as massless .    the decay rate of a bound positronium state into each particular mode , @xmath26 ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of the cross section , @xmath27 , associated with the process @xmath28 in which the @xmath29 constituents of the bound state as a free particles .",
    "so doing , the decay rate for the single photon decay mode of ps is then given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 denotes the probability of finding the electron and positron in the same point of space and @xmath32 is the relative velocity of the colliding @xmath33 pairs . here",
    "the electron - positron annihilation cross sections @xmath34 is    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the totally spin averaged square of the transition matrix element @xmath37 obtained by averaging over the initial @xmath38 and @xmath39 spins ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively ) and summing over the undetected final state neutrino and antineutrino spins ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively ) .",
    "( [ eq-2 ] ) includes the lorentz invariant phase - space factors , as well as the energy - momentum conservation ( which is guaranteed by the @xmath44 functions ) .",
    "ps has a binding energy of 6.8 ev , which gives an upper bound to the momentum of the leptons involved in the decay of ps .",
    "these values are negligible in comparison with the rest mass energy of those leptons , m@xmath6 .",
    "thus , the initial energy - momentum vectors are taken as @xmath45 . using this approximation and applying the momentum conservation through the delta function , the integral over @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq-2 ] ) is performed , yielding    @xmath47    e@xmath48 , with @xmath49 . both figures",
    "( a ) and ( b ) contribute to the case @xmath50 , while only figure ( b ) contributes to the cases @xmath51 .",
    "in addition to these graphs , there are also the graphs where the outgoing photon is emitted off the positron leg . ]",
    "process which involves the exchange of two @xmath0 bosons .",
    "the contribution from this graph is thus highly suppressed and is neglected in our analysis . ]",
    "this expression can be further simplified integrating over the angular degrees of freedom of @xmath52 by virtue of the kinematic constrains present in the delta function resulting in    @xmath53    finally , the angular degrees of freedom of @xmath54 are integrated , leading to the final form for the cross section for electron - positron annihilation into one single photon    @xmath55    the relevant @xmath56 matrix element is secured from the feynman graphs of fig . 1 and the analogous graphs with the photon emitted off the positron leg .",
    "since the momentum transfer is far smaller than the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses , it can be neglected in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson propagators .",
    "so doing and working in feynman gauge , one finds    @xmath57 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the slash notation , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath58 has been employed and we have summed over the polarizations of the final state photon . here @xmath59 is the fermi constant which has the numerical value 1.17@xmath6010@xmath61 gev@xmath62 and @xmath63 is the weak mixing weinberg angle .",
    "we employ the dirac @xmath64 matrix conventions as is defined in ref .",
    "the diagrams with the outgoing photon emitted from the positron leg has the analogous structure except for the replacement the fermionic propagator @xmath65 with the propagator @xmath66 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath67 guarantees that the @xmath0 exchange graph only contributes to the @xmath68 final state .    with the amplitude @xmath37 in hand , the spin averaged transition probability can be extracted by standard techniques .",
    "to do so , we employ mathematica  @xcite .",
    "however , before calculating the total cross section , let us first consider the differential cross section    @xmath69    which in the present case represents the probability to have a collision per unit of area and energy of the emitted photon .",
    "it\"s integral over the photon momentum magnitude gives the total cross section as    @xmath70    the differential cross section is displayed in fig .",
    "the cross section is relatively flat as a function of the photon energy peaking when the energy of the photon is 2m@xmath6/3 , which is represented as the red - dashed line in fig .",
    "3 . in other words ,",
    "the most probable energy of the photon emitted will be 2m@xmath6/3 .     as a function of the energy of the emitted photon .",
    "the red - dashed line represents the photon energy leading to the maximum probability of collision .",
    "]    finally , integrating the differential cross section from @xmath71 $ ] as instructed by eq.([eq-8 ] ) yields the total cross section of the decay mode e@xmath72e@xmath73 which is then employed in the calculation of the decay rate of ps@xmath7 yielding    @xmath74    using @xmath75 gives a decay rate of @xmath76 = 1.72 @xmath60 10@xmath77 s@xmath4 .",
    "this value is roughly the same order as for the @xmath78 ( invisible ) mode for o - ps  @xcite .",
    "due to the presence of the electroweak interactions , additional decay modes become available for the positronium atom . in the present work",
    ", we addressed what is effectively the single photon decay mode of parapositronium , which emerges from the @xmath79 final states and the non observation of the outgoing neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "these processes become operational due to the exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 massive vector bosons . the study of this decay aids in elucidating the role of the electroweak interaction in the decay of ps . since this mode involves the emission of a single photon , it has a somewhat unique signature which in principle may be detected .",
    "the calculated decay rate is @xmath80 = 1.72 @xmath60 10@xmath77 s@xmath4 , which is experimentally challenging , is comparable to the previously reported electroweak mediated decays in orthopositronium but without the photon emission",
    ".    the decay mode presented will be also present in the decay of other exotic atoms , such as true muonium ; the bound state of a muon and anti - muon . for this bound state , the analogous single decay rate for will be at enhanced by a factor of @xmath81 due to the heavier mass of the muon with respect to the electron .",
