    "more recently , this approach has been generalized  @xcite to study the @xmath1 model below the critical temperature , where the so called goldstone mode singularity ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) is observed .",
    "it refers to certain models , further called @xmath0vector models , in which the order parameter is an @xmath0component vector with @xmath3 .",
    "this provides one more example of power law behavior , exhibited by the transverse and longitudinal correlation functions in the ordered phase .",
    "moreover , according to the recent monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results  @xcite , it is very plausible that this behavior is described by nontrivial exponents , as predicted in  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this question in sec .",
    "[ sec : goldstone ] , including some new monte carlo simulation results .",
    "here we discuss the critical exponents of the gfd ( grouping of feynman diagrams ) theory  @xcite , since these are important in our further tests and discussions .",
    "we consider a @xmath1 model with the hamiltonian @xmath4 where the order parameter @xmath5 is an @xmath0component vector with components @xmath6 , depending on the coordinate @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the temperature , and @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant . as in  ( @xcite ) and  ( @xcite ) , it is assumed here that the order - parameter - field @xmath6 does not contain the fourier components @xmath10 with @xmath11 , i.  e. , there exists the upper cut - off parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath1 model with certain dimensionality @xmath0 of the order parameter belongs to the same universality class as the @xmath0vector lattice spin model with spins being @xmath0component vectors of unit length ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : goldstone ] ) .",
    "therefore , the considered here predictions for the critical exponents refer also to these @xmath0vector models .    it has been claimed in  @xcite that possible values of the exact critical exponents for the @xmath1 model in two ( @xmath13 ) and three ( @xmath14 ) dimensions are @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the susceptibility exponent , @xmath17 is the correlation  length exponent , @xmath18 may have a natural value starting with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is an integer equal or larger than @xmath21 . other critical exponents can be calculated from these ones , using the known scaling relations .",
    "these values agree with the known exact solutions of the two  dimensional ising model ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and of the spherical model ( @xmath24 ) . based on the idea that @xmath25 might be considered as a continuous parameter in  ( [ eq : result ] ) within @xmath26",

    "this value of @xmath17 is consistent with the logarithmic singularity of specific heat ( according to @xmath30 ) proposed earlier by tseskis  @xcite .",
    "the exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been later conjectured for the @xmath27 ising model by zhang  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement of these exponents with those of the perturbative rg method can be understood based on a critical analysis  @xcite .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the equations  ( [ eq : result ] ) are meaningful for positive integer @xmath0 , and we can have @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the case where the order parameter is an @xmath0component vector .    a relevant question is how  ( [ eq : result ] ) can be related to specific models , i.  e. , one needs to find @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is well known that the spherical model corresponds to the limit @xmath35 , so that we have @xmath36 at @xmath35 to obtain the known critical exponents of the spherical model in this limit .",
    "consider now the critical exponent @xmath37 which describes the @xmath38 singularity ( at @xmath39 ) of the fourier  transformed two  point correlation function at the critical point . since @xmath36 ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath40 for large @xmath0 is @xmath41    a general conjecture for @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be made assuming that the critical exponents are given by analytic expressions valid for each positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "it results in an essential restriction on possible asymptotic form of @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the only reasonable possibility is @xmath43 at @xmath35 , where @xmath44 must be a positive integer , taking into account that @xmath33 has an integer value at any positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "the latter means also that @xmath45 holds at @xmath35 with an integer coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "an appropriate conjecture is @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are polynomials of orders @xmath44 and @xmath51 with integer coefficients , since @xmath34 and @xmath33 are integers at any integer @xmath52 and @xmath36 holds at @xmath35 . if we accept a physically reasonable idea that critical exponents and their derivatives with respect to @xmath0 behave smoothly and monotonously at @xmath35 , like some power of @xmath0 , then this conjecture is the only possible one .",

    ", integer value of @xmath20 has a meaning .",
    "we will further test just the possibility @xmath75 , i.  e. , the conjecture @xmath78    not only the critical exponents of leading singularities , but also corrections to scaling are important in our tests . according to  @xcite",
    ", corrections to scaling can be represented by an expansion of correction factor ( amplitude ) in integer powers of @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the reduced temperature .",
    "since @xmath83 is an integer number according to  ( [ eq : result ] ) , and @xmath84 holds according to the known scaling relation , we obtain the expansion in powers of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the correction  to  scaling exponent is @xmath86 if the first expansion coefficient is nonzero . here",
    "@xmath87 is the correction  to  scaling exponent , describing the @xmath88 corrections to the critical correlation function .",
    "it shows up also in the finite  size scaling analysis . allowing that some of the expansion coefficients are zero",
    ", we can have @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a positive integer .",
    "a conjecture @xmath91 together with  ( [ eq : conj ] ) has been tested earlier in  @xcite , based on the experimental data near @xmath2transition point in liquid helium .",
    "this conjecture is based on the idea that @xmath92 for some quantities tends to @xmath19 at @xmath93 in the ising case of @xmath94 , as well as at @xmath14 in the limit of the spherical model @xmath35 .",
    "a smooth crossover to the @xmath95ising  behavior at @xmath94 and @xmath93 , or to the spherical  model  behavior at @xmath35 can be expected in the @xmath1 model .",
    "however , it is not necessary for the existence of such a crossover that the correction  to  scaling exponent tends to the corresponding limit value .",
    "a simple possibility is that the expansion coefficients for the nontrivial correction terms vanish in these limit cases .",
    "moreover , even this is not the necessary condition at @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , if we consider a correction factor of the form @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is an arbitrarily large constant , then it is sufficient that @xmath98 holds for any @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a finite constant , which is independent of @xmath97 .",
    "it ensures that this correction factor tends to a finite constant at @xmath35 for any given nonzero value of @xmath82 , since @xmath101 in this limit .",
    "it means that the coefficients of the included here nontrivial correction terms do not need vanish at @xmath35 . as regards the @xmath94 case at @xmath13 , it is further shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonp ] that nontrivial correction terms can be present in the @xmath1 model and absent in the @xmath95 ising model .    according to this discussion ,",
    "( [ eq : correx ] ) represents the most natural conjecture for the correction  to  scaling exponents @xmath92 and @xmath102 , since in this case we do not need to assume that some of correction terms always vanish .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the recent monte carlo simulation results  @xcite for the 3d ising model on very large lattices with linear sizes up to @xmath103 . besides , according to the numerical transfer matrix calculations in  @xcite , a nontrivial correction to finite ",
    "size scaling with the exponent @xmath104 , probably , exists in the two  point correlation function even in the 2d ising model . the relation  ( [ eq : correx ] )",
