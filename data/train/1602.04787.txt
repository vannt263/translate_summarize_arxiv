    "in many strong magnetically driven experiments such as magnetically driven flyer plate , magnetically driven line implosion , and explosive magnetic flux compression , it is important for the metal media to keep in solid state as long as possible .",
    "one reason is that solid state of the metal can reduce the growth rate @xcite of the magneto - rayleigh - taylor ( mrt ) instability @xcite which breaks up the integrity of the system and is one of the main threat to the success of those experiments @xcite .",
    "another reason , for magnetically driven flyer plate experiment @xcite , is that the back - end of the flyer plate must keep in solid state for being able to be implemeted in impact experiments .    the electric resistance of most metals increases with temperature in the condensed region , and especially , the resistance usually poses a jump at some critical temperature near the vaporization point . a typical example of the temperature dependence of metal resistance is shown in fig . [ fig.resistanceofal ] .",
    "+    considering a general magnetically driven experiment that a solid metal media is pushed by a strong magnetic field , shortly after the time started , the magnetic field diffuses into some depth of the metal , and joule heat is generated together and causes a rise of temperature in the diffused region of the metal .",
    "the increase of temperature causes an increase of the metal s resistance due to the positive dependence of resistance on temperature , which in return accelerates the magnetic diffusion and causes the joule heat to be generated faster .",
    "those positive feedbacks acting iteratively may leads finally to a fast penetration of the magnetic field into the metal in case some conditions are satisfied .",
    "since the critical temperature is usually near the vaporization point , this fast penetration would melt or vaporize the metal in a short time , thus we call this phenomenon ` fast - burning '",
    ".    the fast - burning phenomenon may have appeared in many magneto - hydrodynamics simulations of strong magnetically driven experiments where temperature dependence of resistance is considered @xcite .",
    "however , untill now , no specialized study of fast - burning are found in literatures . in this paper , we have a theoretical study of fast - burning , deriving formulas for its existence conditions and penetrating velocity .",
    "let s first establish a simplified mathematical description of the physical problem to be discussed .",
    "the physical problem is a vacuum magnetic field diffuses into a metal slab , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.physicalproblem ] .",
    "kinematic movement is not considered , and temperature diffusion , whose rate is usually @xmath0 smaller than magnetic diffusion , is also neglected .",
    "only magnetic diffusion is considered in the system , i.e. , the control equation is solely @xmath1 the metal s electric resistance poses a typical jump at a critical temperature @xmath2 , as modeled in fig .",
    "[ fig.etatot ] , where @xmath3 is assumed .",
    "the vacuum magnetic field @xmath4 is kept constant in the process . at the initial state ,",
    "the magnetic field distribution in the metal slab is zero .",
    "+   +   +    after the time started , the vacuum magnetic field diffuses into the metal , and joule heat is generated in companion .",
    "if the joule heat density is large enough , it would rise the metal s temperature above its critical temperature @xmath2 , and cause an abrupt increase of its resistance .",
    "the increase of resistance will accelerate the magnetic field diffusion .",
    "those effects act iteratively will cause a fast penetration of the magnetic field into the metal , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.fastburnillustrate2 ] . in the following , for convenience of discussion , we also talk about the critical joule heat density @xmath5 , which is defined as the joule heat per volume ( not per mass ) that is required to heat the metal to its critical temperature .      first , a one - dimensional numerical simulation of the physical problem of fig .",
    "[ fig.physicalproblem ] was carried . in the simulation ,",
    "the metal s parameters are set according to the material of steel .",
    "the metal s critical joule heat density is set @xmath6 ( which is estimated with the formula @xmath7 , with critical temperature @xmath8 , room temperature @xmath9 , heat capacity @xmath10 , and mass density @xmath11 ) .",
    "the metal s resistance below @xmath2 is set @xmath12 while its resistance above @xmath2 is set @xmath13 , and the vacuum magnetic field strength is set @xmath14 .",
    "simulation results of the time evolution of magnetic field distribution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.bzevolve ] .",
    "three typical characteristics are shown in the figure : 1 .",
    "there is a ` knee ' on each distribution line , and the magnetic field strength at the knees is nearly constant ; 2 .",
    "the distribution behind ( leftside ) the knee is very close to a linear distribution ; 3 .",
    "the distribution ahead ( rightside ) the knee is very close to an exponent .",
    "+   +    inspired by the above numerical simulation , we guess a fast - burning solvation of the magnetic diffusion equation as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.magnetodistribution ] .",
    "the solvation is departed into three sections : a constant field in the vacuum section , a linear distribution in the large resistance @xmath15 section , and an exponent distribution in the small resistance @xmath16 section , that is    [ eq.fastburningsolvation ] @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    where @xmath20 is time dependent , @xmath21 , @xmath22 corresponds to the height of the knees in fig .",

    "( [ eq.fastburningsolvation ] ) needs to be determined .",
    "it is related to the critical temperature @xmath2 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig.etatot ] . at the position @xmath20 , the metal s resistance changes from @xmath16 to @xmath15 ,",
    "this means that the joule heat density produced at this point is right @xmath5 .",
    "this joule heat is collected by the moving exponent section .",
    "so we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the moving velocity of the exponent section @xmath36 when the relative position @xmath37 of the exponent section is sweeping over the considered fixed point in the metal , and we have used an approximation @xmath38 which means that the velocity of the exponent section keeps nearly constant when its _ main body _ is sweeping over the considered fixed point . from eq .",

    "the conditions for the emerging of a fast - burning when a vacuum magnetic field diffuses into a metal whose resistance poses a typical jump at some critical temperature are @xmath23 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is the vacuum magnetic field strength , @xmath5 is the joule heat density required to heat the metal to its critical temperature , and @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) is the metal s electrical resistance below ( above ) critical temperature .    the velocity of the wave - front of a fast - burning is @xmath55 , which is proportional to the metal s resistance above critical temperature and propotional to the difference between the vacuum magnetic field strength and the critical magnetic field strength .",
