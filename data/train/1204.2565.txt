    "<S> we consider scattering and transport in interacting quantum wires that are connected to leads . </S>",
    "<S> such a setup can be represented by a minimal model of interacting fermions with sudden changes in interaction strength and/or velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneities generally cause relevant backscattering , so it is _ a priori _ unclear if perfect ballistic transport is possible in the low temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a conducting fixed point surprisingly exists even for large abrupt changes , which in the considered model corresponds to a velocity matching condition . </S>",
    "<S> the general position dependent green s function is calculated in the presence of a sudden change , and is confirmed numerically with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the exact form of the interference pattern in the form of density oscillations around inhomogeneities can be used to estimate the effective strength of local backscattering sources , offering a route to design experiments where the effects of the contacts are minimized .    </S>",
    "<S> the description of transport through quantum wires has become a very well studied research area , as it directly ties together conductivity experiments@xcite with central theoretical models in one dimension , such as the landauer formalism@xcite and luttinger liquids.@xcite landauer showed that the conductance of a single spinless non - interacting quantum channel is always finite and given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the backscattering amplitude.@xcite however , interaction effects change this picture dramatically as @xmath1 becomes temperature dependent through renormalization . in the pioneering work of kane and fisher </S>",
    "<S> it was found that a local perturbation in a repulsive luttinger liquid is relevant , which results in a characteristic powerlaw dependence @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the interaction parameter.@xcite a number of impurity models in one dimension have since been analyzed in detail @xcite and confirm that generically a local perturbation cuts the transport at low temperatures , unless the relevant operator is forbidden by symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> nearly perfect connections between leads and wires can be achieved for different types of quantum wires,@xcite which show quantized conductance at moderate temperatures . at lower temperatures , however , scattering in the connections to the leads </S>",
    "<S> plays an increasingly important role . </S>",
    "<S> the higher dimensional contacts are effectively weakly interacting , so there has been great interest in describing the transport through a quantum wire attached to non - interacting leads.@xcite the minimal model for this setup is a single channel of interacting spinless fermions , where the interaction parameter changes along the wire . under the assumption that it is possible to use a hydrodynamic luttinger liquid description for this model,@xcite </S>",
    "<S> it would be expected that backscattering follows a non - trivial renormalization behavior which is position dependent.@xcite even if the connections are effectively free from imperfections with a homogeneous lattice structure,@xcite there have to be small regions of the wire , the junctions , where the interaction changes , which does not necessarily occur adiabatically and will induce intrinsic backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> this immediately invites the question if it is ever possible to create a perfect connection in the low temperature limit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it is in general unclear how large such intrinsic backscattering is for generic junctions and if it is even justified to use an inhomogeneous luttinger liquid description in the first place for this setup , since the usual bosonization procedure assumes a translational and scale invariant theory .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider the intrinsic backscattering in an inhomogeneous wire and show that a perfectly conducting fixed point can indeed be found by adjusting parameters such as the velocities on both sides . at half </S>",
    "<S> filling it is also possible to estimate the bare strength of the backscattering from the change in the local velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> the full correlation function of an inhomogeneous luttinger liquid is calculated , which agrees with numerical simulations to high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the validity of the inhomogeneous theory and proves that a low energy conducting fixed point can exist even in the presence of large abrupt jumps .    </S>",
    "<S> a hydrodynamic description of interacting fermions with a changing interaction parameter @xmath4 leads to a generalized inhomogeneous luttinger liquid action@xcite @xmath5 , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a canonical bosonic field . here </S>",
    "<S> the effective velocity @xmath7 generally also changes with the interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> we will derive the corresponding correlation function for an abrupt jump below . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , however , backscattering must be considered . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that the hamiltonian density contains a leading relevant oscillating operator given by@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are left and right moving fermion fields and @xmath10 is the fermi - wavenumber . </S>",
    "<S> normally this operator can be neglected under the integral , but this is no longer the case for inhomogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is exactly this operator as a local perturbation which causes the renormalization of defects in wires@xcite and spin chains.@xcite the oscillating part of the interaction results in the same bosonic operator,@xcite so that even a change in interaction alone will induce backscattering .    in principle conductance depends on the connections of the wire to both of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> we will concentrate here on the backscattering in the case where the length of the wire is larger than the coherence length @xmath11 so that it suffices to consider each junction separately.@xcite a single junction can be characterized by changes taking place in a small region around @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath13 is assumed to be slowly varying on the scale of the fermi wavelength so that it is possible to use an expansion of @xmath13 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relevant ] ) and a partial integration to derive an effectively local perturbation @xmath14 while the oscillating operator cancels everywhere in the uniform regions . </S>",

    "<S> is complex , except for particle hole symmetric situations . </S>",
    "<S> even relatively smooth junctions become effectively sharper and sharper under renormalization , so that the relevant backscattering is non - zero unless the amplitude @xmath15 is adjusted to zero , which requires the fine tuning of two parameters . as we will see </S>",
    "<S> later it is indeed possible to identify such conducting fixed points in a lattice model by an appropriate choice of parameters on both sides of the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a conducting fixed point is also of relevance for the discussion about possible charge fractionalization in luttinger liquids.@xcite if the luttinger liquid supports only charges @xmath16 related to the chiral eigenstates of the hamiltonian on each side of the wire , then it seems to be impossible that backscattering can be tuned to zero . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , the backscattering oscillation is strongly suppressed with a different position dependence , but it is not zero . </S>",
    "<S> as the numerical data will show it turns out that the _ relevant _ backscattering term is exactly zero in this case . </S>",

    "<S> we have shown that it is possible to achieve a perfect connection , i.e.  an absence of relevant backscattering , in inhomogeneous wires by tuning other parameters such as the velocity in the lead and in the wire . </S>",
    "<S> the general green s function was calculated in the presence of an abrupt jump along the wire based on an inhomogeneous luttinger liquid action , which was in excellent agreement with numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the observation of friedel oscillations in the density along the wire , which can be attempted by scanning probe microscopy , can be used to analyze local scattering centers . a systematic study of inhomogeneities and thus an experimental test of our results seems feasible in semi - conductor heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> one could start from a device where a quantum wire adiabatically broadens into a two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite by applying a sharp potential barrier at the interface a local backscattering center could then be realized allowing it to continuously tune the backscattering amplitude @xmath15 . </S>"
