    "in general , the shape function @xcite is introduced to describe the decay of a hadron @xmath1 containing a heavy flavour @xmath2 into an inclusive hadronic state @xmath3 with a large energy and a small invariant mass , plus non - qcd partons , i.e. @xmath4 specifically , the selected kinematics is @xmath5 in a more formal language , the conditions ( [ conditio ] ) correspond to the limit @xmath6 the limit ( [ limite ] ) implies the infinite mass limit of the heavy flavour , @xmath7 as @xmath8 the heavy quark can then be treated in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "the divergence of @xmath9 - even though it is slower than the one of @xmath10 - implies that the final hadronic state can be replaced by a partonic one and that perturbation theory ( pt ) can be applied ; however , the decay has also a non - perturbative component - to be factorized in the shape function - which we introduce with the following model .",
    "we identify a hard subprocess in ( [ base ] ) consisting in the fragmentation of the heavy flavour @xmath2 , @xmath11 @xmath12 differs from @xmath3 in that it does not contain the light valence quark(s ) of @xmath1 .",
    "the momentum of @xmath2 can be written as @xcite instead of @xmath13 to define the momentum ( [ peso ] ) ; this amounts to a shift in the range of @xmath14 @xcite . ]",

    "the point @xmath19 is the elastic one where all the initial light partons have soft momenta .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xcite @xmath20 the distribution of the @xmath21-momenta is clearly non - perturbative and it is related to the well - known fermi motion of the heavy quark inside the hadron @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the momentum carried away by the non - qcd partons , taken along the @xmath23 axis ; the final hadronic system flies along the minus direction .",

    "@xmath25 is replaced with a vector lying exactly on the light cone , in the minus direction .",
    "neglecting these mass ( virtuality ) effects , the final hadronic system is described by the leet @xcite or , in geometrical language , by a wilson line _ on _ the light cone .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath32 equation ( [ finale ] ) is the main result of this section .",

    "the physical distribution for ( [ base ] ) is obtained by convoluting the perturbative corrections of the form ( [ suda ] ) with the primordial @xmath34-distribution : this is the way non - perturbative effects enter the game .",
    "we conclude that the process has a substantial non - perturbative component related to the @xmath43-distribution .",
    "let us also present another way to establish the non - perturbative component in the decay ( [ base ] ) , which is a critical analysis of dynamics using only perturbation theory .",
    "we neglect all the binding effects ( confinement , fermi motion , etc . ) and consider an isolated on - shell heavy quark @xmath2 , i.e. we take @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath2 decays into a massless quark @xmath44 plus non - qcd partons : @xmath45 we now consider the emission of a soft gluon , with momentum components of the order of the qcd scale : @xmath46 the invariant mass of the final hadronic state is @xmath47 an invariant mass of the order of ( [ conditio ] ) , i.e. rather large , is generated by the emission of a very soft gluon .",
    "a kinematical amplification by a factor @xmath10 has occurred as the kinematics goes from time - like to light - like with the fragmentation of the heavy flavour .",
    "higher - order perturbative corrections replace the bare coupling with the running coupling evaluated at the transverse gluon momentum @xcite , @xmath48 for a soft gluon with the momentum ( [ soft ] ) , the coupling is evaluated close to the landau pole , indicating the presence of non - perturbative effects .",
    "we conclude again that the decay ( [ base ] ) has the non - perturbative component identified before .",
    "let us observe that the linearization introduced in @xmath49 and the light - cone limit introduced in @xmath50 are not valid approximations for a hard collinear gluon ; by this we mean a gluon with momentum components of order @xmath51 and , in order to have @xmath52 : @xmath53 for such a gluon , all the terms in the last member of eq .",
    "( [ massinv ] ) are of the same order .",
    "its contribution can be considered a short - distance effect , since the transverse momentum ( [ hardcoll ] ) is substantially larger than that of a soft gluon ( [ soft ] ) and the related coupling constant is in the perturbative region .    according to the above discussion",
    ", it is natural to identify the non - perturbative component in ( [ base ] ) as the following matrix element : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a field in the hqet with velocity @xmath56 .",
    "this function gives the probability that the heavy quark in the hadron has a plus virtuality equal to @xmath57 , independently from the other components . in the following section we will critically analyse how the above matrix element factorizes the non - perturbative effects .",
    "we already found that the hard collinear region ( [ hardcoll ] ) can not be described by the shape function but can consistently be incorporated into a coefficient function @xcite .",
    "in order to avoid distributions and to deal only with ordinary functions , it is convenient to consider the light - cone function @xcite @xmath58 from which the shape function is obtained by taking the imaginary part , @xmath59 we want to study if the light - cone function factorizes the non - perturbative effects by performing a perturbative computation .",
    "this involves @xmath60 steps :    1 .   to replace the hadronic light - cone function with a partonic light - cone function ,",
    "is used for the two different matrix elements , as this should not cause confusion . ]",
    "@xmath61 and to perform a perturbative computation .",
    "we take the heavy quark @xmath2 with the momentum ( [ peso ] ) , i.e off - shell by @xmath21 ; 2 .   to perform the same perturbative computation",
    " with the same external states  in the original high - energy theory , i.e. full qcd ; 3 .   to compare the results to see if the difference is a short - distance effect or not .",
    "all this procedure has a meaning if we accept the following assumption : the long - distance effects of _ perturbative _ kind  i.e. the leading infrared logarithms  are able to trace the long - distance effects of _ non - perturbative _ nature .",
    "therefore , if two matrix elements have the _ same _ _ perturbative _ long - distance contributions , they manifest also the _ same _ _ non - perturbative _ long - distance effects if computed with a non - perturbative technique , such as lattice qcd .    at the tree level",
    ", we have the expected result @xmath62 i.e. @xmath63 the shape function is a spike when its argument matches the plus virtuality of the external state , @xmath64 , independently of the other components , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we now consider the double logarithm that appears at one - loop .",
    "let us first discuss the case of a simple regularization cutting the space momenta : @xmath67 since infrared logarithms are associated to quasi - real configurations , for which @xmath68 , we expect this regularization to give the same double logarithm as lattice regularization ( after continuation from euclidean to minkowski space ) . on the lattice ,",
    "all the momentum components are cut off , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the result of the computation done with the regularization ( [ semprelei ] ) is @xcite @xmath71 where we defined the usual combination @xmath72 and @xmath73    the result of the computation done with dimensional regularization ( dr ) is @xcite @xmath74 ,   \\label{drf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 the space - time dimension ) and @xmath77 is the regularization scale . ) , @xmath78 should be replaced by @xmath79 exp@xmath80 $ ] ( @xmath81 is the euler constant ) , even though this rescaling does not affect dla results . ]",
    "we find a double pole of uv nature because infrared singularities ( soft and collinear ) are completely regulated by the light - quark leg being off - shell .",
    "the first problem we encounter is how to renormalize the above expression .",
    "the point is that , to obtain a finite result , one has to subtract not only the double pole , whose coefficient is just a number , but also the simple pole , which has a @xmath82 coefficient @xcite .",
    "it seems that the subtraction of the simple pole can not be performed with a local counter - term , as standard textbooks on renormalization teach one should do .",
    "however , if we blindly subtract all the poles , we obtain @xmath83 we see that the coefficient of the double logarithm is @xmath0 times larger than in eq .",
    "( [ nostra ] ) .",
    "even though we are not able to justify the renormalization procedure , we believe that the above result is correct .",
    "a hint in favour of this conjecture is obtained by repeating the same computation in the bare theory at finite ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off , using a regularization similar to dr , i.e. cutting only the transverse momenta and not the longitudinal ones : . ]",
    "@xmath84 the unbounded integration over the longitudinal components does not give rise to uv divergences and we obtain the result @xcite @xmath85 the transposition of symbols should be clear : the renormalization point @xmath86 is replaced by the uv cut - off @xmath87 .",
    "as anticipated , there is agreement between the two results ( [ drfr ] ) and ( [ lambdat ] ) .",
    "the origin of the factor @xmath0 in the difference of the double logarithms is easily seen by considering the integrals @xmath88 a straightforward computation indeed gives : @xmath89 let us analyse the domains of the @xmath0 integrals in the plane @xmath90 . for @xmath91 ,",
    "the integration region is a triangle - like domain @xmath92 limited by the curves @xmath93 the energies and the transverse momenta in @xmath92 are in the ranges ( see fig.1 ) @xmath94 transverse momenta do become as small as @xmath95 , entering the non - perturbative region . for @xmath96 , the integration region",
    "@xmath97 has again a triangle - like shape and it is limited by the curves @xmath98 assuming @xmath99 we see that @xmath97 contains @xmath92 plus another region @xmath100 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath101 in the `` new '' region @xmath100 @xmath102 the integration over @xmath100 gives a double logarithmic contribution equal to the one coming from the integration over @xmath92 : that is the origin of the factor @xmath0 in the difference between @xmath91 and @xmath96 .",
    "the contribution coming from @xmath100 is a short - distance contribution because it always involves rather large transverse momenta , @xmath103 let us observe also that in @xmath100 the energy @xmath104 of the gluon can become much larger than the uv cutoff , @xmath105 .",
    "one usually relates the cutoff to the hard scale @xmath10 in the full qcd process , which , on the contrary , sets the upper bound for the gluon energies : @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear that we are dealing with highly unphysical regularization scheme effects .",
    "we now compare with the qcd rate , from which a full qcd light - cone function can be defined @xcite , given by @xmath107 it is clear that @xmath87 or @xmath77 is replaced by @xmath10 .",
    "it is immediate to see that the double logarithms match for the @xmath108-regularization , while they do not match for the @xmath87-regularization . in the latter case",
    "the `` spurious '' contribution from @xmath100 can be subtracted by means of the coefficient function , which includes also `` true '' hard collinear effects , finite terms , etc . while in the @xmath108 case",
    "the coefficient function contains at most a single logarithm of @xmath57 , in the @xmath87 case it contains also a double logarithm of @xmath109",
    "we tried to describe in a way as transparent as possible the problem of factorization of non - perturbative effects in the decay ( [ base ] ) by means of the shape function .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the observation that the shape function exhibits a different double logarithm at one loop , depending on the kind of uv regularization adopted @xcite . in a regularization such as dr",
    " cutting only transverse loop momenta  the double logarithm has a coefficient @xmath0 times larger than the one derived with a lattice - like regularization .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the difference between the double logarithms is related to the integration over a region of large transverse momenta , so it is a short - distance effect .",
    "the qcd rate has a double logarithm equal to the one derived in lattice - like regularization .",
    "this implies that the coefficient function in lattice - like regularization contains at most a single logarithm of @xmath57 ( the infrared scale of the problem ) , while in dr it contains also a double logarithm of @xmath57 . in both regularizations , however , non - perturbative effects are factorized inside the shape function .",
