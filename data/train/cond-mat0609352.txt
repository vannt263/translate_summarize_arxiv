    "the inadequacy of pure pair - potential models to describe metallic cohesion is well - known and has been adequately documented@xcite .",
    "various approaches , at varying levels of sophistication , have been used to address the volume - dependence of the energy of a metallic system originating from the presence of the interacting electron gas . these range from using volume - dependent parameters in the pair potential itself@xcite to writing the total energy as a sum of pair potentials plus an empirical volume / density - dependent term@xcite or an electronic band(bond ) energy term@xcite .",
    "the latter is often written in terms of the first few moments of the electronic density of states in the tight - binding approximation@xcite . for transition metals , invoking a simplified model of rectangular @xmath0-density of states due to friedel@xcite , the bond energy term is sometimes approximated simply via the second moment of the density of states @xcite .",
    "an approach that has been widely used in this context is the embedded atom method ( eam ) of daw and baskes@xcite , where the energy of the metal is viewed as the energy to embed an atom into the local electron density provided by the remaining atoms of the system , plus a sum of pair interaction potentials between the atoms .",
    "this method , which was developed almost simultaneously by finnis and sinclair@xcite , starts with the ansatz : @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the total internal energy , @xmath4 is the host electron density at atom @xmath5 due to all other atoms , @xmath6 is the electron density of atom @xmath7 as a function of distance from its center , @xmath8 is the separation distance between atoms @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the function @xmath9 , called the embedding energy , is the energy to embed atom @xmath5 in an electron density @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is a two - body central pair potential between atoms @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the host electron density @xmath4 is assumed to be a linear superposition of spherically symmetric contributions from all individual atoms except atom @xmath5 .    in the model proposed by finnis and sinclair@xcite the total energy of a system of atoms",
    "is assumed to consist of a binding term proportional to the square - root of the local density and a repulsive pairwise potential term .",
    "another approach to this type of theory was provided by manninen@xcite , jacobsen , n@xmath12rskov , and puska@xcite , who derived the functional form of the two terms in eq.(1 ) by using the density functional theory .",
    "although daw and baskes@xcite had also used the density functional theory to justify the use of eq.([etot ] ) , in most applications of the method the two terms of eq.([etot ] ) were written in terms of parameters that were fitted to observed properties of the system . in this sense ,",
    "the eam remains an empirical or at best a semi - empirical method .",
    "however , the simplicity and ease with which it could be applied to a large variety of situations has led to its wide use in the study of liquids@xcite , alloys@xcite , surfaces and interfaces @xcite , impurities and other defects in solids@xcite .",
    "relevant to the present work is the study by foiles and adams@xcite , who investigated some thermodynamic properties of six fcc metals : cu , ag , au , ni , pd and pt via quasiharmonic calculations and molecular dynamics simulation using the eam potentials developed by foiles , baskes and daw@xcite .    by replacing the atomic electron density with an exponentially decaying function ,",
    "johnson@xcite developed a set of analytic eam functions for the nearest neighbor model of fcc metals .",
    "however , this model had the limitation that all materials were forced to have the same anisotropy ratio of the shear moduli : @xmath13 .",
    "oh and johnson@xcite extended the model beyond nearest neighours , at the cost of sacrificing the simple analytic form .",
    "_ @xcite have overcome this challenge and extended this nearest - neighbor model into the one in which the embedded atom potentials are analytic and valid for any choice of the cut - off distance .",
    "in particular they derived the values of the parameter for their eam potential and density functions for six fcc metals : ni , pd , pt , cu , ag , and au .",
    "they used this eam potential in a molecular dynamics study of thermal expansion and specific heat of liquid cu as a function of temperature , using a cut - off for the potential and embedding functions somewhere between the third and fourth neighbors for the corresponding crystalline case . in later studies they applied the model to study self - diffusion in the liquid phase of the above six metals@xcite and the melting in al@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have used this eam potential in a molecular dynamics study of the local structure in supercooled liquid and solid cu and al .",
    "although mei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had derived the values of the eam parameters for six fcc metals : ni , pd , pt , cu , ag , and au , to this date a systematic study of the vibrational and thermodynamic properties of these solids in the bulk crystalline phase using these parameters has not been carried out .",
    "this work presents such a study for the first time and explores to what extent this particular eam model is successful in reproducing the experimentally observed phonon spectra and thermodynamic properties for the above six bulk fcc metals .",

    "we have calculated the elastic constants @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 using the homogeneous deformation method and also from the long wavelength phonons and studied their variation with respect to the number of neighbor shells included in the calculation . for three shells of neighbors our results obtained via",

    "we have compared the phonon frequencies for the test case of cu by using three to six shells of neighbors the maximum difference , which is found for low energy phonons , between the three and six neighbor shells is of the order of 1% .",

    "however , there is virtually no change in the location of the minimum in the static energy as a function of lattice parameter , as well as the curvature at the location of the minimum .",

    "the squares and the circles represent the phonon frequencies from the inelastic neutron scattering experiment at room temperature ( 296 k ) , while the solid line denotes the calculated spectrum . for estimating the importance of the embedding term we have used dashed lines to show the frequencies obtained by considering only the pair potential term , i.e. , neglecting the contribution from the embedding function .",
    "the pair potential and the embedding terms contribute to the force constant with opposite signs : without the embedding term the phonon frequencies at high values of the wave vectors would have much worse agreement with the measured frequencies .",
    "we find that the three - body terms coming from the embedding function ( the last term in eq.([fi ] ) ) have a negligible effect on the phonon frequencies , the values obtained with and without these terms are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "we have also compared the calculated phonon frequencies with the experimental values for off - symmetry wave vectors , as given by nilsson and ronaldson@xcite .",
    "the agreement is similar to that for the wave vectors along the symmetry directions , in the sense that the agreement is very good for small wave vectors , while becoming progressively worse with increasing wave vectors to the same extent as for the symmetry direction wave vectors shown in fig .",

    "the term involving the embedding function in eq.([etot ] ) contributes about @xmath51 to @xmath52 of the total energy for the model of mei _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , but their contribution to vibrational frequencies is less than 10% .",
    "hence , the embedding term contributes to the temperature variation of thermodynamic properties mainly via the static part of the free energy .    for cu",
    "the phonon frequencies calculated by considering only the contributions from the nearest neighbors in the fcc structure produce about 90% of the final converged frequencies originating from all neighbors .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation of svensson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who used several born - von krmn force constant models involving neighbors up to various different shells to study the agreement between the calculated phonon frequencies and those from the inelastic neutron scattering experiment .",
    "their least square fits of atomic and planar force constants to the observed phonon frequencies indicate that the nearest neighbor forces dominate in cu , although longer range forces extending at least to the sixth - nearest neighbors are needed for a complete agreement between the calculated and experimental frequencies .",
    "a similar result was found by nilsson and ronaldson@xcite in a neutron crystal spectrometer study of phonon frequencies in cu at wave vectors of both symmetry and off - symmetry points in the brillouin zone at a temperature of 80 k.    among the six fcc metals , the agreement between the calculated and experimental phonon spectra is almost perfect for ag and only slightly less so for cu .",
    "for all other metals the agreement becomes increasingly worse with increasing wave vectors in all the symmetry directions , the worst case being that of au .",
    "for pd , pt and au the calculated phonon frequencies are underestimated with respect to the experimental results , while they are somewhat overestimated for ni . for cu@xcite , ag@xcite , ni and pd@xcite",
    ", this trend as well as the level of agreement between the calculated and experimental phonon frequencies is the same as in the eam scheme of daw and baskes@xcite , where the total charge density at an atomic location is calculated from the _ ab initio _ hartree - fock results for free atom charge densities @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by daw and hatcher@xcite , as long as the fitting is done primarily to elastic constants , which involve phonons near the zone center only , the agreement for high frequency phonons near the zone boundary is not guaranteed . in this respect , phonons calculated via _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods , which can capture the details of fermi surface topology without resorting to any empirical fitting procedure , can yield superior results@xcite , although results do vary depending on the method of electronic structure calculation and details of the implementation of exchange - correlation potentials , etc@xcite . of course",

    "although the calculated phonon spectra for both au and pt show poor agreement with measured values , measured @xmath84 for au shows much better agreement with the calculated values than for pt . on the contrary ,",
    "measured thermal expansion is much better reproduced for pt than for au by the calculation .    both isothermal and adiabatic",
    "bulk moduli are very well represented over a wide temperature range for all the metals studied .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , as the parameters in the model are determined largely by fitting to the elastic constants , which usually have only very weak temperature - dependence . in general",
    ", the co - efficient of thermal expansion , calculated in the quasiharmonic approximation , is underestimated for most of the metals beyond room temperature . calculated values of @xmath109 for ag ,",
    "cu and au agree very well with the measured values .",
    "for ni the agreement is good both below and above the curie temperature , with the discrepancy increasing as the curie temperature is approached from both above and below .",
    "this is understandable as the present model of eam is not designed to capture the physics of a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition .",
    "the grneisen parameter and debye temperature are underestimated by about 10% for all the metals . however , the temperature variation of the debye temperature , an initial decrease as the temperature is raised from zero for all the metals except au , is reproduced well by the model .",
    "for au the experimental values of the debye temperature show an initial increase .",
    "this feature is also captured by the model .    in summary , the thermodynamic properties of the six fcc metals : cu , ag , au , ni",
    ", pd and pt , and their temperature - dependence are reproduced reasonably well by the eam model of mei _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the coefficient of thermal expansion is underestimated above the room tempearture in the quasiharmonic approximation used in this work .",
    "a better treatment of the anharmonicity in the potentials can improve the results , as evidenced by the molecular dynamics study of mei _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "there is room for much improvement in the phonon dispersion curves for ni , pd , pt and au .",
    "there is some evidence that this can be achieved by a change in the fitting of the parameters .",
    "preliminary calculations with small _ ad hoc _ changes in the parmeters representing the charge density in the model showed remarkable improvement in the phonon frequencies for pd and pt .",
    "this is an indication that a better representation of the charge desnity may lead to improvement for all of these metals .",
