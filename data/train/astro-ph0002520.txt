    "we are already well on on our way to extracting the cosmological information contained in the primary temperature anisotropies , specifically the angular diameter distance to recombination , the baryon density , the matter - radiation ratio at recombination , and the `` acausal '' ( inflationary ) nature and spectrum of the initial perturbations .",
    "even if our simplest inflationary cold dark matter model is not correct in detail , these quantities will be measured in the next few years by long - duration ballooning , interferometry and the map satellite , _ if the acoustic nature of the peak at @xmath165 is confirmed by the detection of a second peak_. in the long term , the high sensitivity and wide frequency coverage of the planck satellite and other future experiments should allow cmb polarization and secondary anisotropies to open new windows on the early universe and large - scale structure .",
