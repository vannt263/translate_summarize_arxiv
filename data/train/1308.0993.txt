    "unexpected states in solid state physics attract a lot of attention from a fundamental point of view .",
    "a recent example is the transient ferromagnetic - like state ( tfls ) in ferrimagnetic gdfeco .",
    "@xcite element specific femtosecond resolution x - ray magnetic circular dichroism@xcite has shown that following the application of a femtosecond laser pulse , the feco sublattice magnetization points in the same direction as the gd sublattice magnetization .",
    "this transient state lasts for just a few picoseconds , but the alignment against the strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the sublattices is very stable , even against large opposing magnetic fields.@xcite more recent work has shown a similar behavior in tbfe alloys , @xcite suggesting this state may exist in a whole class of materials . in this paper",
    "we study the tfls in more depth , especially how the difference in relaxation times of the transition metal ( tm ) and rare earth ( re ) sublattices leads to its formation .",
    "we find that the tfls can also form with the alignment of the rare earth towards the transition metal sublattice , the opposite polarity to that which has been found previously .",
    "this change in polarity comes about due to a difference in the temperature dependence of the characteristic relaxation times of the two sublattices , leading to a crossover behavior , making the rare earth response faster than that of the transition metal .",
    "this is a stark contrast to the commonly proposed relation that the relaxation time of a magnetic species is proportional to the ratio of its atomic magnetic moment @xmath0 and the intrinsic gilbert damping @xmath1 , @xcite a relation which would lead to the false conclusion that the rare earth is always slower that the transition metal .",
    "understanding this difference is important if these materials are to be used for ultrafast magnetic devices , especially where large , dynamic temperature ranges are used .",
    "several theoretical descriptions have been proposed to describe the physical mechanisms underlying the tfls . @xcite",
    "all of them suggest that the tfls is formed by an exchange of angular momentum between tm and re magnetic lattices driven by the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling .",
    "the magnetization transfer leads to the tfls in a non - equilibrium situation between both magnetic sublattices .",
    "the heating produced by the laser pulse causes the tm magnetization to nearly vanish , while that of the re remains finite .",
    "such a behavior is only possible if the demagnetization times ( energy input absorption rate ) of the two sublattices are sufficiently different .",
    "therefore it is necessary to establish a theoretical approach to estimate the relationship between the relaxation times of each sublattice in ferrimagnets which would allow the engineering of generic ferrimagnetic materials , such as synthetic ferrimagnets , @xcite where this phenomenon could occur .    in pure ferromagnets the ratio between the magnetic moment and",
    "the curie temperature , @xmath2 ( or more precisely @xcite @xmath3 ) has been shown to be a good approximation of the _ speed _ of demagnetization , allowing one to classify ferromagnetic materials into two types , fast and slow .",
    "@xcite using this simplistic argument in tm - re alloys such as tbfe , @xcite tbco,@xcite or gdfeco @xcite and assuming a shared @xmath4 , @xcite transition metal demagnetization times are approximately @xmath5 times faster than those of the rare earth . this simple relationship has been shown to work well for temperatures far below the curie point .",
    "@xcite this reasoning restricts the formation of the tfls to a polarity where the tm magnetization will always reverse to align in the re direction .",
    "the importance of the initial temperature ( @xmath6 ) on the demagnetization behavior was shown in recent experiments on ferromagnetic ni thin films where the initial temperature before laser heating was systematically varied.@xcite it was demonstrated that as @xmath6 increases the observed _ fast _ demagnetization becomes a well - defined two step process .",
    "namely , an initial sub - ps demagnetization followed by a much slower demagnetization process of the order of several ps .",
    "similar results where also obtained in ni @xcite and fept thin films@xcite keeping the initial temperature fixed but increasing the laser fluency , and thus reaching higher temperatures .",
    "the observed slowing down of the magnetization response was associated to the increasing role played by the spin fluctuations for temperatures approaching @xmath4 . in rare earth - transition metal alloys ,",
    "similar experiments have been recently performed in situations where , although the initial temperature was varied , it did not approach @xmath4 closely enough to obtain clear evidence of the demagnetization behavior.@xcite from general phase transition theory @xcite one may expect that approaching @xmath4 , both sublattices would experience critical slowing down .",
    "however it is not clear if the critical slowing down is equal for both sublattices and whether the non - equivalence criterion , @xmath7 , still holds close to @xmath4 . to answer these questions",
    ", we theoretically investigate the dynamical response of tm - re alloys to femtosecond heating as a function of the initial temperature and the tm - re composition , using the prototypical example of gdfeco .",
    "we use the landau - lifshitz - bloch ( llb ) equation for multi - sublattice magnets @xcite to provide the quantitative calculation of the magnetization relaxation times for each lattice , including those close to @xmath4 in gdfeco .",
    "these calculations are complemented by large scale computer simulations based on the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation of motion for an atomistic spin model .",
    "these simulations confirm the proposed scenario for the formation of the tfls based on the angular momentum transfer between the two sublattices.@xcite importantly , we derive theoretically the necessary conditions for the formation of the tfls with a reversed polarity and confirm the criteria by means of atomistic spin dynamic simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first outline the basis of the atomistic spin model followed by a consideration of the sublattice relaxation times based on the ferrimagnetic landau - lifshitz - bloch equation and importantly link this to the equilibrium magnetization curves .",
    "this leads to a criterion for equivalent sublattice relaxation times , which defines a region separating opposite polarities of tfls ; a result supported by the large - scale atomistic model simulations .",
    "the energetics of the ferrimagnetic system are described by the classical heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 indicates that the sum is limited to nearest neighbor pairs with @xmath10 , @xmath11 representing the atomic magnetic moment .",
    "we use a random lattice model to represent the amorphous property of gdfeco ( see refs .   and ) .",
    "we assume a simple cubic lattice of feco moments and randomly substitute sites with gd moments until the desired gd concentration , @xmath12 , is achieved , giving a system of gd@xmath13(feco)@xmath14 .",
    "the feco sublattice has a moment @xmath15 representing the @xmath16 itinerant electrons .",
    "@xcite the use of a common sublattice to model feco is justified since the fe and co moments are delocalized in nature and are parallel to one another up to the curie temperature .",

    "typical gd concentrations used in recent experiments of ultrafast dynamics range from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite hence , these alloys behave as an `` effective '' ferromagnet , feco , defined mainly by the value of the intra - lattice exchange integral , @xmath35 , and the gd spins whose dynamics are mainly defined by the antiferromagnetic coupling to the feco spins , defined by the exchange integral @xmath36 .",
    "the effect of gd - gd exchange interactions in these gd concentrations ( @xmath37 ) is relatively small in comparison to other exchange interactions present in the system .",

    "@xcite the coupling constant @xmath51 essentially represents the energy transfer rate between the spin and heat bath . here",
    "each sublattice is separately coupled to the same heat bath , although they could be coupled to different heath baths , such as electron and phonon heat baths as shown in ref . or the same sublattice can be coupled simultaneously to the two baths . @xcite as a consequence of the different magnetization response of each sublattice , given by the intrinsic parameters",
    ", one sublattice can heat faster ( `` hot '' ) than the other ( `` cold '' ) .",
    "the absorbed energy is afterwards dissipated in both the heat bath ( fluctuation - dissipation ) and to the other sublattice ( and eventually to the heat bath ) through the atomic scale exchange coupling .",
    "@xcite the transient ferromagnetic like state in gdfeco is formed under non - equilibrium situations where the latter mechanism dominates .",
    "@xcite    atomistic spin models of this type have become a _ de facto _ tool in the investigation of ultrafast magnetism due to their good quantitative description of the temperature dependent magnetic properties , as well as the timescales of dynamical phenomenon such as the tfls . in principle",
    "one can include many complexities into such a model , for example different values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "such scenarios may be closer to the physical reality , however to clearly explain the most basic relationships behind the dynamics which cause the formation of the tfls we assume @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these values are the same as those used in previous works and describe well the ultrafast demagnetization time scales found experimentally .",
    "@xcite      the role of the magnetization compensation point in the laser induced magnetization switching and the tfls formation is still a subject of controversy in the literature .",
    "@xcite recently we showed that a minimum amount of laser energy input of the order of the energy gap between the two ferrimagnetic modes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath54 , is required for the formation of the tfls,@xcite where @xmath55 is the frequency of the so - called antiferromagnetic coherent exchange mode .",
    "the disordered nature of the gdfeco spin lattice leads an effect that the most efficient energy transfer ( the smallest energy gap ) does not correspond exactly to the coherent mode with @xmath56 but to non - zero @xmath57 value , related to the characteristic length of the gd spins cluster size.@xcite    this slightly shifts the minimum energy for the tfls formation with respect to the magnetization compensation point , where @xmath58 but the minimum energy still lies close to it .",
    "the condition for the minimum energy gap can be fulfilled in two temperature regions ( i ) close to the @xmath24 where @xmath59 , ( with @xmath60 ) , and ( ii ) approaching the curie temperature @xmath4 , where both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are close to zero .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ferrimagnetic exchange modes depends on the concentration of gd ( @xmath12 ) , the initial temperature ( @xmath6 ) and the inter - lattice exchange coupling ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "@xcite among these parameters @xmath12 and @xmath6 can be changed experimentally however @xmath63 is very difficult to change in a gdfeco alloy .",

    ", three well defined regions can be distinguished ( i ) at equilibrium before laser heating , the thermal excitation of the modes does not lead to any net spin transfer between sublattices , ( ii ) during laser heating , the spin wave modes of the system are excited out of equilibrium , leading to an efficient transfer of spin angular momentum between sublattices .",
    "@xcite ( iii ) this process results in a precessional reversal path for the magnetization at the nanoscale @xcite . around @xmath24",
    "the energy efficiency of this mechanism is large since the relevant modes are lower in energy ( @xmath64 ) than when the system is far from @xmath24 .",

    "indeed the tfls has been shown above the compensation point both in spin models and experimentally .",
    "@xcite    apart from the excitation of those modes , before the tfls can form , a full macroscopic demagnetization of the magnetic sublattice which switches ( hot ) is needed , @xcite whereas the other remains finite ( cold ) .",

    "the re relaxation time is only slightly temperature dependent even approaching @xmath4 as @xmath176 , where the ratio between partial susceptibilities does not strongly depend on temperature .",
    "@xcite    we conclude that @xmath172 separates two _ non - equivalence _",
    "regimes for the element specific magnetization dynamics . though this result is strictly applicable only in the linear regime ( small deviations from equilibrium ) , we show next that it can be extended for the laser heating induced tfls and a similar transition can be observed .",
    "with our knowledge of these two non - equivalent regimes , we shall demonstrate that one may selectively excite a certain polarity depending on the composition of the alloy and the initial temperature .",
    "to do so , we use the atomistic spin model described by the hamiltonian and the set of atomistic llg equations to perform extensive computer simulations of pump - probe laser heating experiments in gdfeco alloys for a range of gd concentrations , initial temperatures , and laser fluence .",
    "the dynamical behavior of @xmath177 after the application of a femtosecond laser pulse has been shown to be well reproduced by the two - temperature model ( 2tm).@xcite within this model the electron and phonon systems are described as heat baths with associated temperatures @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "the laser pulse heats the electron system which increases its temperature in the timescale of the order of hundreds of femtoseconds , to around 1000 to 2000 k , afterwards the electron system cools down by transferring energy to the phonon system in the picosecond time scale through the electron - phonon coupling . in our current calculations , this model is simplified by considering that the effect of the laser is to increase the electron temperature from the initial temperature @xmath6 to @xmath179 and then to reduce back to @xmath6 ( a temperature step with @xmath180 fs duration in our model ) .",
    "we use this simple profile for the electron temperature so that we may disentangle the magnetization dynamics from the effect of different temperature profiles which are usually considered in ultrafast pump - probe experiments .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfls ] clearly show that the tfls can be formed in either tm ( + ) or re ( - ) polarities .",
    "this depends on the initial temperature and the gd concentration . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](a),(b ) we calculate the polarity and duration of the tfls for two different pulse powers with @xmath181 and @xmath182 k , representing a low and high power input .",
    "the coloring , red or blue , represents the polarity of the state formed and the intensity of the color represents the duration . the result with a low power input ( @xmath183 k )",
    "is that the transition temperature @xmath184 lies close to our theoretical prediction , @xmath184 .",
    "this happens because the temperature difference between @xmath6 and @xmath185 at high temperatures when @xmath186 is not very large , and the pulse duration is short so the dynamics are still within the linear regime .",
    "the positive polarity , the one already observed experimentally ( blue area ) , follows the @xmath24 line , supporting the ferrimagnetic exchange mode excitation described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : formation ] .",
    "for a higher power input ( @xmath187 k ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](b ) , the tfls is formed beyond the boundary of our predicted transition temperature , because the linear approximation is no longer valid .",
    "nonetheless , the qualitative shape of these regions is still captured by our theoretical curves .",
    "this confirms that the insights gained from our theoretical estimations based on the llb model still are useful in such highly non - equilibrium situations .    in both high and low power examples ,",
    "the region of relaxation time equivalence ( marked in yellow ) prohibits the formation of a tfls as we had expected .",
    "this result gives a clear link between the equilibrium temperature measurements that are likely to be easily measured in experiments and the non - equilibrium ultrafast laser induced control of the transient ferromagnetic - like state in ferrimagnets .",
    "the experimental verification of our findings is a real challenge since initial high temperature measurements using element specific femtosecond resolution xmcd would not be straightforward due to the small magnetic signals expected .",
    "however , recent experiments in cotb alloys have shown that tb magnetization demagnetizes faster as the ratio @xmath71 increases .",
    "@xcite to demonstrate this they used different tb concentrations rather than changing the initial temperature .",
    "this result agrees with our findings .",
    "in addition , recent experiments @xcite measured the spatial distribution of feco and gd atoms in a heterogeneous gdfeco alloy , showing significant clustering of the re and tm species into regions with large correlation lengths .",
    "using time resolved xmcd that probed nanoscale spin dynamics they found that , for some gd - rich regions ( equivalent to our high gd concentration alloys ) , the transient ferromagnetic like state has gd polarity .",
    "@xcite associated this behavior with a non - local magnetization transfer between gd - rich and feco - rich regions by superdiffusive spin transport .",
    "this observation also provides at least indirect support for the formation of the re- driven tfls polarity predicted here .",
    "moreover , the laser heating in their work completely demagnetizes the sample , _",
    "i.e. _ a high laser fluence scenario and we know from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] that with a higher fluence the negative polarity state becomes more prevalent . a direct comparison between fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] and these experiments is not possible due to the macroscopic clustering found by graves _",
    "@xcite which will cause a distribution of effective curie temperatures in the sample .",
    "also , the sensitively of the results to the curie temperatures and compensation temperatures mean that a more detailed knowledge of the magnetic properties of their sample would be needed for a direct comparison .",
    "our results however , show that non - local angular momentum transfer is not necessary to interpret their experimental findings if one applies our theory .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the femtosecond laser induced transient ferromagnetic - like state ( tfls ) polarity in rare earth - transition metal ( re - tm ) ferrimagnets can be controlled by tuning the initial temperature and gd impurity concentration .",
    "we have demonstrated that a non - equivalent heating efficiency of the two sublattices is a key criterion for the formation of the tfls . to show this , we have studied in detail the re - tm ferrimagnetic gdfeco alloy and shown that due to the different nature of the spin fluctuations",
    "the magnetic response of each sublattice depends distinctly on the temperature .",
    "microscopically , the magnetization dynamics of the tm sublattice is dominated by ferromagnetic fluctuations that slow down its dynamics approaching @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the rare - earth impurities are dominated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations that make its dynamics almost temperature independent .",
    "therefore , our results predict that , at high temperatures , the conventionally slow relaxing rare earth magnetic impurities may become faster than the transition metal magnetization .",
    "our results highlight the requirement for the two sublattices to have different relaxation times in order to form a tfls which can lead to switching in the positive polarity . in the region of equivalence in the relaxation rate of the two sublattices , no tfls can be formed and therefore switching is also prohibited .",
    "these results could have important implications for the design of future all - optical thz devices since we have also provided a simple picture of this non - equivalence in terms of measurable quantities , @xmath188 and @xmath118 , with the further advantage that it can be generalized to other multi - sublattice alloys .",
