    "it sounds good , after all music is art ! but physics challenge is to discover laws wherever they are @xcite . to care for , it is proposed , here , a sound consonance law on the basis of mathematical and physical foundations .",
    "as we know , occidental musics are based in the so called just intonation scale , built with a set of musical notes which frequencies are related between them in the interval of frequencies from some @xmath0 to @xmath1 that defines the octave .",
    "human audible sound frequencies comprehend from about @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and a typical piano keyboard covers 7 octaves from notes @xmath4 to @xmath5 , with frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , using the standard tuning up frequency attributed to the note @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , @xcite@xmath10    the origin of actual musical scale remits us to the greek mathematician pythagoras . using a monochord , a vibrating string with a movable bridge that transforms into a two vibrating strings with different but related lengths and frequencies",
    ", he found that combinations of two sounds with frequency relations @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are particularly pleasant , while many other arbitrary combinations are unpleasant .",
    "two sounds getting a pleasant combined sound are called consonants , otherwise they are dissonant .",
    "this set of relations encompassed into the frequencies interval of one octave defines the pythagorean scale , which is shown in table 1 , with notes and frequency relations of each note compared to the first one , @xmath14 .",
    "table 2 shows the frequency relations of the two adjacent notes , with a tone given by 9/8 and a semitone given by 256/243 .",

    "consonance and dissonance are not absolute concepts , and the greek astronomer ptolomy added to the pythagorean consonant relations @xmath37 another set of relations who considered as well as consonant , @xmath38 .",

    "actually , in terms of the consonant frequency relations , the just intonation scale is richer than the pythagorean scale .",
    "it can be understood why it is just so attempting to the physical condition to the sound waves consonance we are going to establish in next section .",
    "notice that all natural sound can be treated as composed by a linear combination of harmonic waves with frequencies related to the fundamental one , @xmath0 , as @xmath44 for integer @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "all these harmonic components are considered as consonant with the fundamental and the relative weight of these harmonics is a characteristic of the sound source , which frequencies spectrum defines one of the most important sound quality , the timbre .    natural musical scale as the just intonation scale implies some practical problems due to the unequal frequency relations that define one tone or half tone related notes . to avoid such trouble , it was created the scale of equal temperament ( chromatic scale ) , composed with 12 notes with equal frequency relation @xmath47 between adjacent notes from a fundamental @xmath0 to the octave above @xmath48 frequencies , @xmath49 such that @xmath50 there is no exact frequency relation ( [ con2 ] ) , but it is closely approximated , in a compromise to favor the practice .",
    "the scale of equal temperament is widely used as an universal tuning up of mostly popular musical instruments , with a few exceptions as the violin or the singing natural human voice .",
    "for the purpose to establish the law of sound consonance , the essential thing is to know how two sound waves with different frequencies , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , combine when produced simultaneously ( harmony ) or in a quick time sequence ( melody ) .",
    "our daily hearing experience suggests us that the quality of the sounds composition is essentially due to the frequencies combination of the sounds , irrespective to their phases and amplitudes . in this sense , it is sufficient , at least at the first sight , to examine just the time oscillation , given by the trigonometric relation @xcite @xmath53 which shows a main wave with mean frequency @xmath54 modulated by the beat frequency @xmath55 without loss of generality , we are going to suppose @xmath56 .",
    "we can see that , if @xmath57 that is , @xmath58 for integers @xmath59 , the resulting wave is , yet , a regular and periodic wave , behaving like a sound wave composed with harmonic sound components , as it is in fact .",
    "it can be seen inverting the trigonometric relation ( [ sum ] ) above using the frequency relation ( [ con1 ] ) , which leads to @xmath60 for some frequency @xmath61 used as the fundamental one .",
    "it is all we need to have an harmonious or consonant combinations of sound waves . if the frequency relation ( [ con1 ] ) is an integer , the two sounds are harmonically related and trivially consonant sounds",
    "otherwise , it defines the frequency relations in the range of an octave , the frequency interval that comprises a musical scale , that is , @xmath62 @xmath63 , such that the relation ( [ con1 ] ) must be a rational number limited by@xmath64 for an integer @xmath65 , remembering that @xmath66 and @xmath67 implies the harmonic relations @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .    in equations ( [ inverse ] ) and ( [ fun ] ) , it is assumed that @xmath70 and@xmath71 which can be used in equations of  the beat and the mean frequencies , ( [ beat ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) , respectively , resulting @xmath72 and@xmath73 showing that , taking into account the physical consonance condition ( [ con ] ) , all the relevant frequencies are related harmonically to a fundamental one , @xmath0 , which can assume values in the range @xmath74    it is easy to handle the situation when the primary sound waves has different amplitude . equation ( [ sum ] ) must be replaced by@xmath75   + \\left (   a_{2}-a_{1}\\right )   \\cos2\\pi f_{2}t\\ ] ] and the condition of consonance applied to the equal amplitude terms , taken aside the last term .",
    "then , using the inverse relation ( [ inverse ] ) , the last term can be reincorporated , resulting the more general formula @xmath76 getting more confidence considering that in a real world a fine control of the sound intensity is not a simple task .",
    "an ultimate generalization is need to take into account the phase difference between the primary sound waves .",
    "such phase difference can be originated due to the small , uncontrollable , time difference the primary sounds are produced .",
    "then , the left side of the sum ( [ gen ] ) is better to be rewritten as @xmath77   + w\\left [   \\sin\\right ]   \\ , \\label{phase}%\\ ] ] where@xmath78   = b_{1}\\cos2\\pi f_{1}t+b_{2}\\cos2\\pi f_{2}t \\label{cos}%\\ ] ] and@xmath79   = c_{1}\\sin2\\pi f_{1}t+c_{2}\\sin2\\pi f_{2}t \\label{sin}%\\ ] ] are the cosine and  the sine wave components , respectively , with coefficients@xmath80 of the cosine component and@xmath81 of the sine component . applying the consonance condition ( [ con ] ) ,",
    "the cosine component is just given by the equation ( [ gen ] ) , @xmath78   = b_{1}\\cos2\\pi(n-1)f_{0}t+b_{2}\\cos2\\pi(n+1)f_{0}t\\ .",
    "\\label{cos1}%\\ ] ]    using the trigonometric relation@xmath82 the same consonance condition ( [ con ] ) works for the sine waves , resulting @xmath79   = c_{1}\\sin2\\pi(n-1)f_{0}t+c_{2}\\sin2\\pi(n+1)f_{0}t\\ .",
    "\\label{sin1}%\\ ] ]    it is possible to reverse all these proceeding , getting the quite general expression @xmath83 a guarantee that the consonance condition ( [ con ] ) works in a real situation .",
    "it is easy to verify that the frequency relations as @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy , all of than , the condition ( [ con ] ) or ( [ con1 ] ) .",
    "for example , in the pythagorean frequency relations , we have @xmath84 and , in the ptolomyan frequency relations , @xmath85    in pythagorean scale , in the table 1 there are 4 consonant relations ( 9/8 , 4/3 , 3/2 and 2 ) and in the table 2 there are 5 consonant relations 9/8 .",
    "in the just intonation scale , in the table 3 there are 6 consonant relations ( 9/8 , 5/4 , 4/3 , 3/2 , 5/3 , 2 ) and in the table 4 all of the 7 frequency relations are consonant .",
    "it is the reason why the just intonation scale is better than the pythagorean scale .",
    "sound sources are vibrating systems , and produce sounds that are combinations of a fundamental and its harmonics , with a particular combination defining the timbre of the sound .",
    "so , to the consonance condition being consistent , frequency relations like ( [ con ] ) must be valid simultaneously to all , the fundamental and its harmonic frequencies .",
    "fortunately , it is so , as we can see easily .",
    "really , taking the compositions of all oscillating modes of the two sound sources with fundamental frequencies @xmath51and @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively , the combination of these two composed sounds ( considering at a moment the equal amplitudes @xmath89 ) becomes , from ( [ sum ] ) , @xmath90    applying the consonance condition ( [ con1 ] ) , supposing @xmath91 , we obtain the inverse trigonometric expansion given by ( [ inverse ] ) in a general form ( [ gen]),@xmath92 which is an harmonic series .",
    "again , it is all we need to have an harmonious or consonant combinations of sound waves .",
    "the physical consonance condition given by equation ( [ con ] ) assures the harmonic structure of the sound waves combination such that it behaves like a natural sound waves with an enriched timbre .",
    "however , we have to take into account the hearing sensibility of the human auditory system @xcite and @xcite , able to recognize sounds at frequencies range from about @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 figure 1 shows a mathematical representation of an artificial computer generated pure sound frequencies ( a ) @xmath9 of the musical scale standard @xmath8 note , ( b ) @xmath93 corresponding to the note @xmath94 , ( c ) @xmath95 of the note @xmath96 and ( d ) @xmath2 , the low audio frequency threshold , in the time interval @xmath97 .",
    "figure 1    if the beat frequency is bellow the low audio frequency threshold , @xmath98 that occurs when the primary frequencies @xmath86 and @xmath51 are close , which implies big @xmath45 , the fundamental frequency @xmath0 is going to be missing for our audition .",
    "in this situation , the sound composition given by ( [ sum ] ) can not be heart as an harmonically related sounds ( [ inverse ] ) , but instead , it is listen as @xmath99 an unique sound with frequency @xmath100 modulated by an inaudible beat frequency @xmath101 .",
    "this modulation , for a very close frequencies , leads to the well known beat phenomenon .",
    "beat frequency near the transition region between audible and inaudible frequencies might be confusing to the auditory system like an antenna trying to tune in a signal with frequency in the border of its work range frequencies .",
    "in such a way , the missing of the fundamental frequency , while of physiological nature , can breaks down the consonance condition of the primary frequencies .",
    "so , even satisfying the physical consonance condition given by equation ( [ con ] ) , our audition will not going to perceive as consonant . in the central octave frequencies",
    "range , taking the first note , @xmath94 , with frequency @xmath102 , the low frequency limit ( [ low ] ) occurs at the condition @xmath103 , above which the auditive perception of consonance is going to be broken . as a result , the major second one tone interval as the @xmath104 , related by frequencies ratio @xmath23 , which corresponds to @xmath105 , is not considered as consonant . with primary frequencies @xmath93 and @xmath106 of the notes @xmath94 and @xmath107 , the resultant mean and the beat frequencies are @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "this beat frequency is out of the audible frequencies range and , even satisfying the physical consonance condition ( [ con ] ) , this is not considered as consonant .",
    "it is shown in the figure 2a , with the presence of a characteristic wave modulation . in sequence ,",
    "figure 2b is an illustration of the sound composition with frequencies ratio @xmath43 , the half tone interval , satisfying the consonance condition with @xmath110 .",
    "frequencies considered are @xmath93 and @xmath111 of the notes @xmath94 of the sharp @xmath112 , resulting a sound with the mean frequency @xmath113 modulated by the beat frequency @xmath114 .",
    "figure 2c is a composition of the notes @xmath94 ( @xmath115 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath116 ) , with frequencies ratio @xmath41 , a clearly non consonant relation .",
    "figure 2d is a simple example of a non consonant sound combination , with arbitrary frequencies , actually @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) and @xmath117 , mean and beat frequencies @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "figures 2a and 2b , while satisfying the physical consonance , has a well defined periodicity commanded by their beat frequencies , but figures 2b and 2d , do not satisfying the consonance condition , show a clearly non periodic time evolution , resulting an undefined pitch of the resultant sounds .",
    "figure 2    the sensibility of the human auditory system to the audio frequency range is individual and depends on a several factors such as the age or the health , to cite some of them . as a consequence , the human perception of the consonance as the pleasant sensation it produces , while reinforced by a physical condition as the equation ( [ con ] ) , involves as well the individual subjective feeling .    also , the human hearing perception of consonance or dissonance is not absolute , and a slight deviation around the consonance condition ( [ con ] ) is not perceived by the human auditory system .",
    "it is the reason why the musical scale of equal temperament is acceptable .    in sequence ,",

    "a principal characteristic of a consonant combination of sounds is the well defined periodicity of the resultant wave , a clear consequence of the condition of consonance ( [ con ] ) .",
    "another important feature is that the consonance condition is not affected by changing the relative phases or the relative amplitudes of the composing sound waves .",
    "an important consequence is that the consonance condition works as well as for harmony and melody .",
    "an exact mathematical frequencies relation is presented to define a physical consonance law of sound waves .",
    "it assures  an harmonic structure of the sound waves combination such that it behaves like a natural sound waves with an enriched timbre , the beat frequency working as the fundamental one .",
    "it is not affected by changing the relative phases or the relative amplitudes of the primary sound waves and , as a consequence , the consonance condition is valid for harmonic and melodic sound composition . nevertheless , in situation where the beat frequency is out of the audible range of frequencies encompassed by the human auditory system",
    ", the consonance perception is going to be broken , even the physical condition is satisfied . as a consequence ,",
    "the human perception of the consonance as the pleasant sensation it produces , while reinforced by an exact physical relation , may involve as well the individual subjective feeling that depends on a several factors such as the age or the health , for example .",
    "a principal characteristic of the consonance condition is the well defined periodicity of the resultant wave .",
    "the dissonance is characterized by the absence of periodicity in such a way that there is no defined pitch .",
    "it suggests that the consonance condition should be released to a more weak form of the consonance condition , @xmath155 which implies@xmath156 for integers @xmath45 and @xmath157 , instead the more restrictive condition given by equations ( [ con ] ) and ( [ con1 ] ) , from now on should be referred as the strong form ( @xmath158 ) of the consonance condition . in this released form , any rational number is going to satisfy it for some integer @xmath159 , but now the beat frequency does not work as the fundamental one ; they are related by @xmath160 and  the chance of the long time periodicity given by @xmath161 to be out of the hearing perception increases together @xmath159 .",
