    "it has been long since mesonic molecules in the charm sector were first theorized @xcite but there was not any experimental observation until the discovery of the @xmath2 in 2003 in the @xmath7 channel @xcite . however , important details of the inner structure of the resonance are still under debate . among many different interpretations of the @xmath2 , the one assuming it to be , or in general @xmath8 we are actually referring to the combination of these states with their charge conjugate ones in order to form a state with positive c - parity . ] a @xmath9 , hadronic molecule ( either a bound state  @xcite or a virtual state  @xcite ) with quantum numbers @xmath10 ( as recently confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the most promising .",
    "quite a lot of work has been done under this assumption , for reviews , see , for instance , refs .  @xcite .     into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ... assuming the @xmath13 to be a @xmath1 molecule .",
    "the charge conjugated channel is not plotted.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the most discussed decay channels of the @xmath2 are those with a charmonium in the final state , which include the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the hadronic molecular picture , these decays occur through the mechanism depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortdis ] .",
    "thus , the charm and anti - charm mesons only appear in the intermediate ( virtual ) state , and the amplitude of such decays is proportional to the appropriate charged or neutral @xmath14 loop integrals  @xcite . because the quarks in the two mesons have to recombine to get the charmonium in the final state , the transition from the charm",
    " anti - charm meson pair into the @xmath15 plus pions ( or a photon ) , occurs at a distance much smaller than both the size of the @xmath2 as a hadronic molecule ( @xmath16 few fm s ) fm where @xmath17 is the reduced mass of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 pair and @xmath20  @xcite . ] and the range of forces between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons which is of the order of @xmath21 fm . in this case , if this transition matrix @xmath22 in fig .",
    "[ fig : shortdis ] does not introduce any momentum dependence , the loop integral reduces to the wave function of the @xmath2 at the origin , @xmath23 ,   ( more properly , around the origin , the needed ultraviolet regulator , for which we do not give details here , would smear the wave functions ) @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the coupling of the @xmath2 to the @xmath26 pair and @xmath27 is the diagonal loop function for the two intermediate @xmath18 and @xmath19 meson propagators , with the appropriate normalizations that will be discussed below .",
    "the last equality follows from the expression of the momentum space wave function  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath17 is the reduced mass of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this can be easily derived from the schrdinger equation assuming the coupling of the @xmath2 to @xmath1 to be a constant , which is valid since the @xmath2 is very close to the threshold .",
    "thus , one can hardly extract information on the long - distance structure of the @xmath2 from these decays .    in general , to be sensitive to the long - distance part of the wave function of a hadronic molecule , it is better to investigate the decay processes with one of the constituent hadrons in the final state and the rest of the final particles being products of the decay of the other constituent hadron of the molecule .",
    "for instance , for the case of the @xmath2 as a @xmath1 molecule , we should use the @xmath0 or @xmath29 to study the long - distance structure . in these processes",
    ", the relative distance between the @xmath1 pair can be as large as allowed by the size of the @xmath2 resonance , since the final state is produced by the decay of the @xmath19 meson instead of a rescattering transition .",
    "these decay modes have been addressed in some detail in different works , e.g. , refs .",
    "the @xmath30 mode has been already observed by the belle collaboration  @xcite , which triggered the virtual state interpretation of the @xmath2  @xcite , and it will be studied in detail in this work .    on the other hand , heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) and flavor symmetry @xcite have been widely used to predict partners of the @xmath2 state  @xcite .",
    "moreover , hqss heavily constrains also the low - energy interactions among heavy hadrons @xcite .",
    "as long as the hadrons are not too tightly bound , they will not probe the specific details of the interaction binding them at short distances .",
    "moreover , each of the constituent heavy hadrons will be unable to see the internal structure of the other heavy hadron .",
    "this separation of scales can be used to formulate an effective field theory ( eft ) description of hadronic molecules  @xcite compatible with the approximate nature of hqss . at leading order ( lo )",
    "the eft is particularly simple and it only involves energy - independent contact range interactions , since pion exchanges and coupled - channel effects can be considered subleading  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the influence of three - body @xmath31 interactions on the properties of the @xmath2 was found to be moderate in a faddeev approach  @xcite . in particular",
    "since we will only be interested in the @xmath2 mass and its couplings to the neutral and charged @xmath1 pairs , the three - body cut can be safely neglected at lo . as a result of the hqss , assuming the @xmath2 being a @xmath1 molecular state , it is expected to have a spin 2 partner , a @xmath32 @xmath33-wave hadronic molecule  @xcite .",
    "this is because the lo interaction in these two systems are exactly the same due to hqss .",
    "the interaction between a @xmath18 and a @xmath34 , on the contrary , is different .",
    "it depends on a different combination of low energy constants ( lecs )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay , on one hand , detects the long - distance structure of the @xmath2 , on the other hand , it provides the possibility to constrain the @xmath35 @xmath33-wave interaction at very low energies .",
    "hence , it is also the purpose of this paper to discuss the effect of the @xmath35 @xmath33-wave final state interaction ( fsi ) in the @xmath36 decay , which can be very large because of the possible existence of a sub - threshold isoscalar state in the vicinity of 3700 mev  @xcite .    as mentioned above",
    ", this @xmath2 decay channel has been previously studied .",
    "the first calculation was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite using effective - range theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , using an eft , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite was reproduced at lo , and the size of corrections to the lo calculation was estimated .",
    "these next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections to the decay width include effective - range corrections as well as calculable non - analytic corrections from @xmath37 exchange .",
    "it was found that non - analytic calculable corrections from pion exchange are negligible and the nlo correction was dominated by contact interaction contributions .",
    "the smallness of these corrections confirms one of the main points raised in  @xcite , namely , that pion exchange can be dealt with using perturbation theory .",
    "however , the @xmath35 fsi effects were not considered in these two works .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : interaction ] , we briefly discuss the @xmath2 resonance within the hadronic molecular picture and the @xmath33-wave low - energy interaction between a charm and an anti - charm mesons .",
    "the decay @xmath0 is discussed in detail in section  [ sec : ddpi ] with the inclusion of the @xmath35 fsi .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] presents a brief summary .",
    "the basic assumption in this work is that the @xmath2 exotic charmonium is a @xmath40 bound state with quantum numbers @xmath41 . for the sake of completeness we briefly discuss in this section the formalism used in @xcite to describe this resonance , which is based on solving and finding the poles of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( lse ) .",
    "more specific details can be found in these two references .",

    "( [ eq : loop0])([eq : loopc ] ) being finite , they should however be evaluated using the same uv renormalization scheme as that employed in the @xmath233 eft .",
    "the applicability of the eft relies on the fact that long range physics should not depend on the short range details .",
    "hence , if the bulk of contributions of the loop integrals came mostly from large momenta ( above 1 gev for instance ) , the calculation would not be significant .",
    "fortunately , this is not the case , and the momenta involved in the integrals are rather low .",
    "indeed , the biggest fsi contribution comes from the imaginary part of the loop function in the neutral channel , which is hardly sensitive to the uv cutoff . thus and for the sake of simplicity , fsi effects",
    "have been calculated using the analytical expressions for the three - point loop integral mentioned above , valid in the @xmath234 limit . nevertheless , we have numerically computed these loop functions with 0.5 and 1 gev uv gaussian cut - offs and found small differences(c ) ) .",
    "this is because there , the three meson loop integral is purely real .",

    "[ fig : c0a ] .",
    "indeed , the changes turn out to be almost inappreciable for @xmath237 gev , and they are at most of the order of few percent in the @xmath119 gev case .",
    "moreover , even then , these differences are well accounted for the error bands shown in the figure .    to compute @xmath222 and @xmath227",
    "we need the @xmath35 potential given in eq .  .",
    "with the inputs ( masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath94 resonances and the ratio @xmath177 ) discussed in section  [ sec : interaction ] , three of the four couplings , that describe the heavy meson - antimeson @xmath33-wave interaction at lo in the heavy quark expansion , can be fixed .",
    "the value of the contact term parameter @xmath70 is undetermined , and thus we could not predict the @xmath35 fsi effects parameter - free in this @xmath2 decay .",
    "these effects might be quite large , because for a certain range of @xmath70 values , a near - threshold isoscalar pole could be dynamically generated in the @xmath35 system @xcite .    to investigate the impact of the fsi , in fig .",
    "[ fig : c0a ] we show the dependence of the partial decay width on @xmath70 . for comparison ,",
    "the tree - level results are also shown in the same plots .",
    "the vertical lines denote the values of @xmath70 when there is a @xmath35 bound state at threshold .",
    "when @xmath70 takes smaller values , the binding energy becomes larger ; when @xmath70 takes larger values , the pole moves to the second riemann sheet and becomes a virtual state . around the values denoted by the vertical lines , the pole is close to threshold no matter on which riemann sheet it is .",
    "one can see an apparent deviation from the tree - level results in this region .",
    "the wavy behavior is due to the interference between the fsi and the tree - level terms .",
    "the existence of a low lying @xmath35 bound state has as a consequence a decrease of the partial decay width to @xmath238 , the reason being that there s a substantial probability of a direct decay to the @xmath35 bound state and a neutral pion . on the other hand",
    "if there is a virtual state near the threshold , the decay width will increase owing to rescattering effects  .",
    "when the partial decay width will be measured in future experiments , a significant deviation from the values in eq .   will indicate a fsi effect , which could eventually be used to extract the value of @xmath70 . outside the wavy region , the fsi contribution is small , and it will be unlikely to obtain any conclusive information on @xmath70 from the experimental @xmath235 width .",
    "however , there exist theoretical hints pointing out the existence of a @xmath239 bound state close to threshold . in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath94 mass input was not used , but however there , it was assumed that the @xmath240 and @xmath241 were @xmath242and @xmath243 molecular states .",
    "these two new inputs were used to fix completely the heavy meson - antimeson interaction , and a @xmath239 molecular isoscalar state was predicted at around 3710  mev . a state in the vicinity of @xmath244",
    "was also predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , within the hidden gauge formalism , using an extension of the su(3 ) chiral lagrangians to su(4 ) that implements a particular pattern of su(4 ) flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "experimentally , there is support for that resonance around 3720 mev from the analysis of the @xmath245 belle data  @xcite carried out in @xcite .",
    "however , the broad bump observed above the @xmath239 threshold by the belle collaboration in the previous reaction could instead be produced by the @xmath246 state  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors show that the charged component @xmath247 in the @xmath2 is essential to obtain a width for the @xmath248 compatible with the data . in the process",
    "studied in this work , at tree - level , the charged component does not directly contribute , though it could indirectly modify the @xmath249 coupling @xmath112 .",
    "however , because the @xmath2 resonance is placed so close to the @xmath250 threshold , we argued that this is not really the case and such a component hardly changes the prediction for the decay width . when the fsi is taken into account , one may ask whether the charged component is important or not since it can now contribute as the intermediate state which radiates the pion .",
    "we find , however , this contribution plays a small role here , leading to changes of about ten percent at most for the @xmath251 gev case , and much smaller when the uv cutoff is set to 1 gev .",
    "these variations are significantly smaller that the uncertainty bands displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : c0a ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the relative importance of the charge component in the @xmath2 depends on the process in question",
    ". when the observable is governed by the wave function of the @xmath2 at the origin , it can be important as the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . for our case ,",
    "the decay is more sensitive to the long - distance structure of the @xmath2 , then the charged component is not as important as the neutral one .",
    "at this point , we can also comment on the processes @xmath252 and @xmath253 , where the @xmath254 system has now a negative @xmath255 parity in contrast to the pionic decay .",
    "the decay amplitudes , when neglecting possible contributions from the @xmath256 , are similar to the one in eq .  . near the @xmath35 threshold ,",
    "the intermediate @xmath132 is almost on shell , and the virtuality of the charged @xmath257 is much larger .",
    "thus , the partial decay width into the @xmath258 should be much smaller than the one into the @xmath259 , as discussed in ref .",
    "in this work , we explored the decay of the @xmath2 into the @xmath131 using an effective field theory based on the hadronic molecule assumption for the @xmath2 .",
    "this decay is unique in the sense that it is sensitive to the long - distance structure of the @xmath2 as well as the strength of the @xmath33-wave interaction between the @xmath18 and @xmath34 .",
    "we show that if there was a near threshold pole in the @xmath35 system , the partial decay width can be very different from the result neglecting the fsi effects .",
    "thus , this decay may be used to measure the so far unknown parameter @xmath70 in this situation .",
    "such information is valuable to better understand the interaction between a heavy and an anti - heavy meson . in view that some of the @xmath260 states which are attracting intensive interests are good candidates for the heavy meson hadronic molecules , it is desirable to carry out a precise measurement of that width .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that since this decay is sensitive to the long - distance structure , the contribution of the @xmath2 charged component @xmath261 is not important even when the @xmath35 fsi is taken into account .",
    "we have also discussed how a future measurement of the @xmath192 distribution might provide valuable information on the @xmath2 wave function at the fixed momentum @xmath193 .",
