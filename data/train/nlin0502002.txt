    "in the last two decades , intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , also termed discrete breathers ( dbs ) , have become a topic of intense theoretical and experimental investigation ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a number of recent reviews on the topic . per their inherent ability to bottleneck and potentially transport the energy in a coherent fashion ,",
    "such exponentially localized in space and periodic in time entities have come to be of interest in a variety of contexts .",
    "these range from nonlinear optics and arrays of waveguides @xcite to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) inside optical lattice potentials @xcite and from prototypical models of nonlinear springs @xcite to josephson junctions @xcite and dynamical models of the dna double strand @xcite .",
    "the ubiquitous nature of nonlinear lattice systems ( i.e. , arrays of coupled nonlinear oscillators ) has prompted the examination of the behavior of nonlinear waves in these systems , particularly for the waves that are well - known and understood in the continuum analogs of these equations i.e. , in nonlinear partial differential equations . in this direction of activity , many of the coherent , nonlinear wave structures that have previously been discovered in continuum settings such as regular solitons @xcite , compactons @xcite , shock waves @xcite or gap solitons @xcite have been recently examined in the discrete setting ; see , e.g. , the works of @xcite for regular solitary waves , @xcite for discrete compactons , @xcite for discrete shock waves or @xcite for lattice gap solitons .    on the other hand , a continuum nonlinear wave that was recently obtained in the context of shallow water wave equations , namely the peakon ( a peaked soliton solution with a discontinuity in the first derivative at its peak ) only very recently started to be considered in the discrete context@xcite .",
    "peakons were given their name ( in the context of the so - called camassa - holm equation , which is a dispersive , integrable model @xcite ) due to their discontinuous derivative at peak amplitude .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that such `` sharply pointed '' structures were also obtained much earlier in the context of nonlocal models for plasmas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . while",
    ", at first glance , it may not appear particularly natural to have discrete analogs of these solutions , as derivatives are not , strictly speaking , defined in the context of the spatial lattice , our aim in the present work is to examine the `` discrete peakon '' .",
    "this will be a lattice profile in the form ( in fact , exactly ) @xmath1 that in the continuum limit will asymptotically approach the continuum peakon solution .",
    "a number of twists accompany this discrete peakon solution introduced here . in the discussion",
    ", we will illustrate that glimpses of solutions that can be categorized under this new `` species '' may have already appeared in a somewhat generalized form in earlier works .",
    "we hope this may initiate a more general examination of the presently suggested lattice peakons .",
    "we believe that we have encapsulated the key mechanisms whose interplay can give rise to the existence of peakons ( in both the discrete and the continuum setting ) in a model of the klein - gordon ( kg ) variety and its nonlinear - schrdinger ( nls ) type analog .",
    "it is interesting to note that both the dispersive and the nonlinear terms that we have combined in the present setting have appeared previously in diverse contexts ( that will be mentioned below ) ; however , they were never combined to allow for the existence of peakons .",
    "another intriguing bit concerns the stability properties of the peakons which are also examined in what follows .",
    "we find that the peakons , while unstable in the kg variant of our model , become stable in its nls version .",
    "this is because the negative energy direction present the former model is prohibited by the charge conservation in the latter model . in the kg case ,",
    "discrete _ breathing _ peakons are possible instead .",
    "interestingly , such solutions were also identified earlier in closed form in a class of models very different than the ones examined herein [ more specifically in a class of homogeneous , nearest neighbor , klein - gordon hamiltonians ] in @xcite .",
    "finally , it is remarkable that the presently examined class of models and its stability features can be treated by methods available for the continuous nonlinear field equations as illustrated below .    our presentation will be structured as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we will discuss the model and its motivation .",
    "in section  [ sec : numerical ] , the numerical results will be presented for site - centered , as well as for inter - site centered peakons . in section  [ sec : analytical ] , we will examine the stability of such structures through analytical considerations based on constrained energy minimization , as well as on functional analytic arguments . in section  [ sec : breathers ] , the existence of discrete breathing peakons is discussed .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we will summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as some open questions for future studies .",
    "examining the peakon from the `` reverse engineering '' ( or the inverse problem ) point of view , we would like to use the properties of a solution of the form @xmath2 , to construct a ( continuum as well as a ) discrete lattice with dynamics that supports such peaked solutions . adopting this viewpoint ,",
    "some of the key properties of @xmath3 are that @xmath4 this second property ( cf . also @xcite ) justifies why a strongly localized impurity ( of the form of a @xmath5-function ) may be a relevant context in which such peaked solutions could arise .",
    "we will return to this point in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "another , perhaps more interesting for our purposes , property is the result of convolution of such a peaked function with a kac - baker exponential interaction kernel @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the convolution yields : @xmath7    this suggests immediately from a mathematical perspective a klein - gordon ( kg ) , as well as a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model with long - range interactions that would support _ exact _ peakon solutions of the form @xmath8 . in particular the kg model",
    "would read : @xmath9 the peakons in this case would represent static solutions of the kg equation .",
    "the corresponding nls model would be of the form @xmath10 wherein the peakons correspond to standing wave solutions of the form @xmath11 .",
    "continuing along this lane of reverse construction ( the motivation for each of the relevant terms will be given below ) , we now explain that an interesting feature of the above considerations is that they can also be carried through in the discrete setting .",
    "in particular , for @xmath12 , we sum up the geometric series establishing that : @xmath13 consequently , for the discrete kac - baker interaction kernel @xmath14 we can devise a discrete kg , as well as a discrete nls model that have discrete analogs of peaked solutions .",
    "the discrete kg model is of the form : @xmath15 u\\sb n , \\label{jeq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the _ exact _ discrete peakon solution @xmath16 , while the corresponding discrete nls chain can be formulated as : @xmath17 u\\sb n , \\label{jeq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a discrete peakon given by the standing wave @xmath18 is the exact solution of the model .",
    "it is these latter equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ jeq7 ] ) and ( [ jeq8 ] ) ] and their dependence on the parameter @xmath19 that determines the interaction `` range '' that we plan on investigating in what follows . notice that @xmath19 can be considered as a natural spacing parameter .",
    "it is interesting to note as a side remark ( to which we will return in later sections ) that this model not only supports an exact `` on - site '' discrete peakon solution such as the one given above , but additionally supports _ exact _ `` inter - site '' peakon solutions of the form : @xmath20 for the klein gordon ( in the dnls case it is @xmath21 ) .",
    "the value of the prefactor @xmath22 is given by the relation @xmath23 .",
    "\\label{twosite}\\ ] ] such explicit solutions ( especially inter - site ones ) are rarely available in non - integrable discrete models .",
    "inter - site solutions are typically less stable than their on - site siblings @xcite . in the present setting",
    ", we will study in detail the behavior of such two - site peakons numerically as well as analytically .    in motivating the model , aside from its intrinsic mathematical interest due to the existence of the peaked solutions ( both in the discrete case and in the continuum limit )",
    ", we should remark that both the dispersive and the nonlinear terms included here have appeared in a variety of settings before .",
    "the kac - baker type kernel @xcite , aside from its relevance in models of statistical physics , has been used quite extensively in recent nonlinear studies of lattice models emulating biopolymer dynamics including dna ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "hence , this type of interaction is rather ubiquitous and can be controllably tuned ( depending on the value of @xmath19 ) , to be practically nearest neighbor ( for large @xmath19 ) or much longer range ( for @xmath24 ) .",
    "let us note also that in the past and in the framework of continuum equations similar forms of this kernel had been examined in the work of @xcite ( but in a rather different dynamical model , namely one of the kdv type ) wherein it was found that traveling waves acquired a peaked waveform . in contexts more closely related to the ones of the present work ,",
    "let us also mention that `` cusp solitons '' ( i.e. , peakons ) were also found in continuum models of the nls type with kac - baker interactions in @xcite ( however , they were unstable ) and in the case of a nonlocal klein - gordon field theory in @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic nonlinearity in nonlinear model equations was originally introduced in the context of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "it reappeared in @xcite , where it was proposed as an equation for generalized quantum mechanics .",
    "later in @xcite , it was suggested as a description for extended objects in nuclear matter , while more recently it was examined in the context of a scalar field model in inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "these studies have also triggered a more mathematically oriented interest in this nonlinearity and the properties of the solutions of the corresponding nonlinear wave equations @xcite .",
    "perhaps , most closely to the purposes of interest to this study , this type of logarithmic field theory has appeared in saturable nonlinear optical media .",
    "the initial investigations of @xcite in the latter context , in the framework of the `` mighty morphing '' spatial solitons , were later placed in a more physically realistic framework in connection with photorefractive materials in @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that for the nonlinear waveguide evolution , the logarithmic nonlinearity provides an accessible model that offers valuable insight , while maintaining the characteristic features of the underlying physical process .",
    "a note of caution should however be made in this connection in that the nonlinearity of eqs .",
    "( [ jeq7])-([jeq8 ] ) should be viewed as a more reasonable physical model for larger amplitudes ( where it can be considered as an approximation of a more physical nonlinear term such as @xmath25 ) . for amplitudes tending to @xmath26 ,",
    "the divergence of @xmath27 appears to be somewhat unphysical and leads to the absence of a small amplitude excitation ( so - called `` phonon '' ) spectrum .",
    "the combination of the features of the dispersive interaction ( its controllable range and wide applicability ) and of the logarithmic nonlinearity ( an accessible one representing adequately a number of physical processes ) renders our model a possibly good playground to study , e.g. , an array of coupled saturable nonlinear ( logarithmic ) waveguides .",
    "both the potential relevance of our results in this context , as well as their inherent mathematical interest in establishing the discrete properties and behavior of the peaked solutions , lead us to examine eqs .",
    "( [ jeq7 ] ) and ( [ jeq8 ] ) in what follows .",
    "the equations that we will examine can be re - written in a more general form : @xmath28 for the kg lattice and @xmath29 for the dnls chain ; recall that @xmath30 is given by eq .",
    "( [ extra ] ) . for eqs .",

    ". the exact solutions of interest for eq .",
    "( [ jeq9 ] ) are of the familiar peakon form mentioned previously : @xmath33    we examine the linear stability of these solutions by using in eq .",
    "( [ jeq9 ] ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the original peakon and @xmath36 are the eigenfrequencies of linearization around the solution ( @xmath37 are the corresponding eigenvectors ) . the resulting linear stability equation ( obtained by using the ansatz of eq .",
    "( [ jeq11 ] ) to o@xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ jeq9 ] ) ) reads : @xmath39 this is an eigenvalue problem for the matrix @xmath40 .",
    "the discrete peakon is linearly unstable if there are eigenfrequencies @xmath36 with the negative imaginary part .",
    "since the matrix elements @xmath41 are bounded and translation - invariant ( only depend on @xmath42 ) while @xmath43 exponentially decays as @xmath44 , one can show that the eigenvalues of the truncated matrix , with @xmath45 , will tend to the eigenvalues of ( [ jeq12 ] ) as @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenvalue for the truncated matrix can easily be solved using numerical linear algebra packages ; this gives the approximate eigenfrequencies @xmath36 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath37 .    for the dnls lattice , the stability can be performed in the `` co - rotating '' frame @xcite , using the ansatz @xmath47 . \\label{jeq13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the resulting linear stability equations will be of the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the linear stability ( jacobian ) matrix of the form @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( the jacobian should be evaluated at the peakon profile , @xmath52 ) .",
    "we now proceed to examine stability and dynamics properties of peakons in klein - gordon and dnls systems .",
    "the profile of a peakon is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : peakonkg ] , together with the spectrum of eigenfrequencies of the equation linearized at the peakon . for the kg chain , we find that the solutions are unstable ( for all values of @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is because of a _ negative energy direction _ that leads to an imaginary pair of eigenfrequencies .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector has the same shape as the peakon itself .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we have engineered a mathematical model that has discrete peakons as exact solutions . the continuum version of the model was also given and its ability to support the continuum analog of the solutions was highlighted .",
    "both the dispersive and the nonlinear part of the relevant interactions were connected to earlier works .",
    "furthermore , it was advocated that for suitable choice of the interaction range , this can be a relevant model in nonlinear optics with the characteristic features of photorefractive materials @xcite , while being a lattice dynamical model of interest in its own right .",
    "we have identified the discrete peakon solutions analogous to their ( discontinuous in the first derivative ) continuum limit , i.e. , @xmath53 , as well as their inter - site siblings .",
    "however , a natural question of interest would be whether there is a more general way of defining such solutions in the discrete setting .",
    "this is particularly relevant as solutions similar to the ones obtained here have appeared in other contexts .",
    "such examples consist of , e.g. , the waveform of fig . 1 in @xcite ( arising from the presence of an impurity ) or that of fig . 7 in @xcite",
    "( arising because of the interplay of nonlinearity with long range interactions , as is the case in this paper ) .",
    "perhaps , an alternative criterion possibly involving the sign of the second difference close to the center of the wave could be used for a more general definition of the discrete peakon .",
    "this would be an interesting topic for future studies .",
    "we have also investigated the stability of such discrete waves and have found discrete peakons to be particularly interesting from this aspect as well . we have numerically observed that in the klein - gordon lattice setting such solutions are always unstable ; however the negative energy direction responsible for this instability is eliminated due to an additional symmetry ( the phase invariance that leads to the @xmath54-norm conservation ) in the case of the dnls chain .",
    "we showed ( using a derrick - type argument ) that the peakon is not a local minimizer of the energy in the klein - gordon case and moreover indicated the direction of the perturbation that leads to a linear instability .",
    "we also showed that in the @xmath55-invariant dnls equation the peakon is a local minimizer of the energy under the charge constraint and hence is orbitally stable .",
    "contrary to their one - site counterparts , two - site peakons proved to be unstable , as was explicitly demonstrated via a well - known functional analytic criterion relevant to dnls type equations .    finally , using a separation of variables approach ,",
    "we were able to show the existence of the _ exact _ periodic ( breathing ) peakon solutions in the klein - gordon lattice .",
    "the breathing peakons were shown to correspond to the subcritical initial conditions , while supercritical initial conditions lead to the amplitude of the solution tending to infinity ( in infinite time ) , with the unstable static peakon being the separatrix between the two types of behavior .",
    "we also systematically tackled the initial value problem for the klein - gordon lattice and showed that the finite - time blow - up of the @xmath54-norm of the solution is not possible , so that the system is globally well - posed .",
    "we then proved the absence of the linear instability of the breathing peakons . yet",
    ", the question of the long - time behavior of perturbed breathing peakons remains open .",
