    "the accretion induced collapse of a rapidly rotating white dwarf can result in the formation of a rapidly and differentially rotating compact object .",
    "it has been suggested that such rapidly rotating objects could emit a substantial amount of gravitational radiation @xcite , which might be observable by the gravitational wave observatories such as ligo , virgo and geo .",
    "it has been demonstrated that if the collapse is axisymmetric , the energy emitted by gravitational waves is rather small @xcite .",
    "however , if the collapsed object rotates rapidly enough to develop a non - axisymmetric ` bar ' instability , the total energy released by gravitational waves could be @xmath0 times greater than the axisymmetric case @xcite .",
    "rotational instabilities of rotating stars arise from non - axisymmetric perturbations of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the @xmath3 mode is known as the _ bar mode _ , which is often the fastest growing unstable mode .",
    "there are two kinds of instabilities .",
    "a _ dynamical _ instability is driven by hydrodynamics and gravity , and develops on a dynamical timescale , i.e.  the time for sound waves to travel across the star .",
    "a _ secular _",
    "instability is driven by dissipative processes such as viscosity or gravitational radiation reaction , and the growth time is determined by the dissipative timescale .",
    "these secular timescales are usually much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "an interesting class of secular and dynamical instabilities only occur in rapidly rotating stars",
    ". one convenient measure of the rotation of a star is the parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath6 is the gravitational potential energy . dynamical and secular instabilities set in when @xmath7 exceeds the critical values @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "it is well known that @xmath10 and @xmath11 for uniformly rotating , constant density and incompressible stars , the maclaurin spheroids @xcite .",
    "numerous numerical simulations in newtonian theory show that @xmath8 and @xmath9 have roughly these same values for differentially rotating polytropes with the same specific angular momentum distribution as the maclaurin spheroids @xcite . however , the critical values of @xmath7 are smaller for polytropes with some other angular momentum distributions @xcite . and",
    "general relativistic simulations also suggest that the critical values of @xmath7 are smaller than the classical maclaurin spheroid values @xcite .",
    "most of the stability analyses to date have been carried out on stars having simple _ ad hoc _ rotation laws .",
    "it is not clear whether these rotation laws are appropriate for the nascent neutron stars formed from the accretion induced collapse of rotating white dwarfs .",
    "new - born neutron stars resulting from the core collapse of massive stars with realistic rotation laws were studied by mnchmeyer , janka and mller ( mnchmeyer & mller 1988 ; janka & mnchmeyer 1989ab ) , and zwerger and mller .",
    "the study of mnchmeyer et al .",
    "shows that the resulting neutron stars have @xmath12 .",
    "zwerger and mller carried out simulations of 78 models using simplified analytical equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "they found only one model having @xmath13 near core bounce .",
    "however , @xmath7 remains larger than 0.27 for only about one millisecond , because the core re - expands after bounce and slows down .",
    "the pre - collapse core of that model is the most extreme one in their large sample : it is the most rapidly and most differentially rotating model , and it has the softest eos . in addition , they found three models with @xmath14 .",
    "rampp , mller and ruffert subsequently performed 3d simulations of three of these models .",
    "they found that the model with @xmath15 shows a non - linear growth of a non - axisymmetric dynamical instability dominated by the bar mode ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , no instability is observed for the other two models during their simulated time interval of tens of milliseconds , suggesting that they are dynamically stable .",
    "their analysis does not rule out the possibility that these models have non - axisymmetric secular instabilities , because the secular timescale is expected to range from hundreds of milliseconds to few minutes , much longer than their simulation time .",
    "the aim of this paper is to improve zwerger and mller s study by using realistic eos for both the pre - collapse white dwarfs and the collapsed stars . for the pre - collapse white dwarfs , we use the eos of a zero - temperature degenerate electron gas with electrostatic corrections .",
    "a hot , lepton rich protoneutron star is formed as a result of the collapse .",
    "this protoneutron star cools down to a cold neutron star in about 20  s ( see e.g.  burrows & lattimer 1986 ) , which is much longer than the dynamical timescle .",
    "so we adopt two eos for the collapsed stars : one is suitable for protoneutron stars ; the other is one of the standard cold neutron - star eos .    instead of performing the complicated hydrodynamic simulations , however",
    ", we adopt a much simpler method .",
    "we assume ( 1 ) the collapsed stars are in rotational equilibrium with no meridional circulation , ( 2 ) any ejected material during the collapse carries a negligible amount of mass and angular momentum , and ( 3 ) the neutron stars have the same specific angular momentum distributions as those of the pre - collapse white dwarfs .",
    "the justifications of these assumptions will be discussed in section  [ col - mod ] .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "first we build the equilibrium pre - collapse rotating white dwarf models and calculate their specific angular momentum distributions",
    ". then we construct the resulting collapsed stars having the same masses , total angular momenta and specific angular momentum distributions as those of the pre - collapse white dwarfs .",
    "all computations in this paper are purely newtonian . in the real situation ,",
    "if a dynamical instability occurs , the star will never achieve equilibrium .",
    "however , our study here can still give a useful clue to the instability issue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present equilibrium models of pre - collapse , rapidly and rigidly rotating white dwarfs . in section  [ col - mod ] ,",
    "we construct the equilibrium models corresponding to the collapse of these white dwarfs .",
    "the stabilities of the collapsed objects are discussed in section  [ stability ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "as mass is accreted onto a white dwarf , the matter in the white dwarf s interior is compressed to higher densities .",
    "compression releases gravitational energy and some of the energy goes into heat @xcite . if the accretion rate is high enough , the rate of heat generated by this _ compressional heating _ is greater than the cooling rate and the central temperature of the accreting white dwarf increases with time .",
    "the inner core of a carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) white dwarf becomes unstable when the central density or temperature becomes sufficiently high to ignite explosive carbon burning .",
    "carbon deflagration releases nuclear energy and causes the pressure to increase .",
    "however , electron capture behind the carbon deflagration front reduces the temperature and pressure and triggers collapse .",
    "such a white dwarf will either explode as a type  ia supernova or collapse to a neutron star .",
    "which path the white dwarf takes depends on the competition between the nuclear energy release and electron capture @xcite .",
    "if the density at which carbon ignites is higher than a critical density of about @xmath16 @xcite , electron capture takes over and the white dwarf will collapse to a neutron star .",
    "however , if the ignition density is lower than the critical density , carbon deflagration will lead to a total disruption of the whole star , leaving no remnant at all .",
    "more recent calculations by bravo & garca - senz , taking into account the coulomb corrections to the eos , suggests that this critical density is somewhat lower : @xmath17 .",
    "the density at which carbon ignites depends on the central temperature .",
    "the central temperature is determined by the balance between the compressional heating and the cooling and so strongly depends on the accretion rate and accretion time . for zero - temperature c - o white dwarfs , carbon ignites at a density of about @xmath18 @xcite , which is higher than the above critical density .",
    "if the accreting white dwarf can somehow maintain a low central temperature during the whole accretion process , carbon will ignite at a density higher than the critical density , and the white dwarf will collapse to a neutron star . the fate of an accreting white dwarf as a function of the accretion rate and the white dwarf s initial mass is summarized in two diagrams in the paper of nomoto ( see also nomoto & kondo 1991 )",
    ". roughly speaking , low accretion rates ( @xmath19 ) and high initial mass of the white dwarf ( @xmath20 ) , or very high accretion rates ( near the eddington limit ) lead to collapse rather than explosion .    under certain conditions , an accreting oxygen - neon - magnesium ( o - ne - mg )",
    "white dwarf can also collapse to a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the collapse is triggered by the electron captures of @xmath21 and @xmath22 at a density of @xmath23 .",
    "electron captures not only soften the eos and induce collapse , but also generate heat by @xmath24-ray emission .",
    "when the star is collapsed to a central density of @xmath18 , oxygen ignites @xcite . at such a high density , however , electron captures occur at a faster rate than the oxygen burning and the white dwarf collapses all the way to a neutron star .    in this section",
    ", we explore a range of possible pre - collapse white dwarf models .",
    "we assume that the white dwarfs are rigidly rotating .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the timescale for a magnetic field to suppress any differential rotation , @xmath25 , is short compared with the accretion timescale .",
    "for example , @xmath26 if the massive white dwarf has a magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "we construct three white dwarf models using the eos of a zero - temperature degenerate electron gas with coulomb corrections derived by salpeter .",
    "all three white dwarfs are rigidly rotating at the maximum possible angular velocities .",
    "_ model  i _ represents a c - o white dwarf with a central density of @xmath28 , the highest @xmath29 a c - o white dwarf can have before carbon ignition induces collapse .",
    "_ model  ii _ is also a c - o white dwarf but has a lower central density , @xmath30 .",
    "this is the lowest central density for which a white dwarf can still collapse to a neutron star after carbon ignition .",
    "_ model  iii _ is an o - ne - mg white dwarf with @xmath31 , that is the density at which electron captures occur and induce the collapse .",
    "since the densities are very high , the pressure is dominated by the ideal degenerate fermi gas with electron fraction @xmath32 that is suitable for both c - o and o - ne - mg white dwarfs .",
    "coulomb corrections , which depend on the white dwarf composition through the atomic number @xmath33 , contribute only a few per cent to the eos at high densities , so the three white dwarfs are basically described by the same eos .",
    "we treat the equilibrium rotating white dwarfs as rigidly rotating , axisymmetric , and having no internal motion other than the motion due to rotation .",
    "the lichtenstein theorem ( see tassoul 1978 ) guarantees that a rigidly rotating star has reflection symmetry about the equatorial plane .",
    "we also neglect viscosity and assume newtonian gravity . under these assumptions",
    "the equilibrium configuration is described by the static euler equation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is pressure ; @xmath36 is density ; @xmath37 is the gravitational potential , which satisfies the poisson equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the fluid s velocity @xmath40 is related to the rotational angular frequency @xmath41 by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the distance from the rotation axis and @xmath44 is the unit vector along the azimuthal direction .",
    "the eos we use is barotropic , i.e.   @xmath45 , so the euler equation can be integrated to give @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "the enthalpy ( per mass ) @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 and is defined only inside the star .",
    "the boundary of the star is the surface with @xmath50 .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is determined by hachisu s self - consistent field method @xcite : given an enthalpy distribution @xmath51 , we calculate the density distribution @xmath52 from the inverse of equation ( [ enthalpy ] ) and from the eos .",
    "next we calculate the gravitational potential @xmath53 everywhere by solving the poisson equation  ( [ poisson ] )",
    ". then the enthalpy is updated by @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 determined by two boundary conditions . in hachisu s paper , the axis ratio , i.e.  the ratio of polar to equatorial radii , and the maximum density are fixed to determine @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , we find it more convenient in our case to fix the equatorial radius @xmath57 and central enthalpy @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the gravitational potential at the centre and at the star s equatorial surface respectively .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the enthalpy and density distribution converge to the desired degree of accuracy .",
    "we used a spherical grid with @xmath62 radial spokes and @xmath63 evenly spaced grid points along each radial spoke .",
    "the spokes are located at angles @xmath64 in such a way that @xmath65 correspond to the zeros of the legendre polynomial of order @xmath66 : @xmath67 .",
    "because of the reflection symmetry , we only need to consider spokes lying in the first quadrant .",
    "poisson s equation is solved using the technique described by ipser and lindblom  .",
    "the special choice of the angular positions of the radial spokes and the finite difference scheme make our numerical solution equivalent to an expansion in legendre polynomials through order @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "although the white dwarfs we consider here are rapidly rotating , the equilibrium configurations are close to spherical , as demonstrated in the next subsection .",
    "so a relatively small number of radial spokes are adequate to describe the stellar models accurately .",
    "we compared the results of @xmath69 with @xmath70 and find agreement to an accuracy of @xmath71 .",
    "the accuracy of the model can also be measured by the virial theorem , which states that @xmath72 for any equilibrium star ( see e.g.  tassoul 1978 ) . here",
    "@xmath5 is the rotational kinetic energy ; @xmath6 is the gravitational potential energy and @xmath73 .",
    "we define @xmath74 all models constructed in this section have @xmath75 .",
    "we constructed three models of rigidly rotating white dwarfs .",
    "all of them are maximally rotating : material at the star s equatorial surface rotates at the local orbital frequency .",
    "models  i and ii are c - o white dwarfs with central densities @xmath28 and @xmath30 respectively ; model  iii is an o - ne - mg white dwarf with @xmath31 .",
    "the properties of these white dwarfs are summarized in table  [ wdmodels ] .",
    "we see that the angular momentum @xmath76 decreases as the central density @xmath29 increases , because the white dwarf becomes smaller and more centrally condensed .",
    "although @xmath5 increases with @xmath29 , @xmath77 increases at a faster rate so that @xmath4 decreases with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "we also notice that the mass does not change much with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is that massive white dwarfs are centrally condensed so their masses are determined primarily by the high density central core . here",
    "the degenerate electron gas becomes highly relativistic and the coulomb effects are negligible , so the composition difference is irrelevant .",
    "hence the white dwarf behaves like an @xmath78 polytrope , whose mass in the non - rotating case is independent of the central density .",
    "the masses of our three models are all greater than the chandrasekhar limit for non - rotating white dwarfs .",
    "a non - rotating c - o white dwarf with @xmath28 has a radius @xmath79 and a mass @xmath80 .",
    "when this white dwarf is spun up to maximum rotation while keeping its mass fixed , the star puffs up to an oblate figure of equatorial radius @xmath81 and polar radius @xmath82 , and its central density drops to @xmath83 .",
    "this peculiar behaviour is caused by the soft eos of relativistic degenerate electrons , which makes the star highly compressible and also highly expansible .",
    "when the angular velocity of the star is increased , the centrifugal force causes a large reduction in central density , resulting in a dramatic increase in the overall size of the star .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table  [ tab : prop ] shows some properties of the collapsed objects resulting from the collapse of the three white dwarfs in section  [ ini - mod ] .",
    "we define the radius of gyration , @xmath84 , and the characteristic radius , @xmath85 , of the star by @xmath86 we see that @xmath84 and @xmath85 that result from the same initial white dwarfs are insensitive to the neutron - star eos , while there is a dramatic difference in the central density @xmath29 and the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy @xmath7 .",
    "the collapsed stars with the hot eos have smaller @xmath29 and @xmath7 than those with the cold eos .",
    "in fact , the central densities of these hot stars are less than nuclear density .",
    "it is well - known that a non - rotating star can not have a central density in the sub - nuclear density regime ( @xmath87 ) because the eos is too soft to render the star stable against gravitational collapse .",
    "it has been suggested that if rotation is taken into account , a star with a central density in this regime can exist .",
    "such stars are termed ` fizzlers ' in the literature @xcite . however",
    ", these so - called fizzlers in our case can exist for only about 20  s before evolving to rotating cold neutron stars . in order to build a stable cold model in the sub - nuclear density regime",
    ", the collapsed star has to rotate much faster , which is impossible unless the pre - collapse white dwarf is highly differentially rotating .",
    "we mention in section  [ introduction ] that zwerger and mller performed 2d hydrodynamic simulations of axisymmetric rotational core collapse .",
    "their pre - collapse models are rotating stars with @xmath78 polytropic eos , which is close to the real eos of a massive white dwarf .",
    "all of their pre - collapse models have a central density of @xmath18 ( see their table  1 ) .",
    "the model a1b3 in their paper is the fastest ( almost ) rigidly rotating star , but its total angular momentum @xmath76 and @xmath7 are respectively 22 per cent and 40 per cent less than those of our model  i of the pre - collapse white dwarf , though both have the same central density .",
    "this suggests that the structure of a massive white dwarf is senstive to the eos .",
    "zwerger and mller state in their paper that no equilibrium configuration exists that has @xmath88 for the ( almost ) rigidly rotating case .",
    "this assertion is confirmed by our numerical code .",
    "zwerger and mller adopt a simplified analytical eos for the collapsing core . at the end of their simulations , the models a1b3g1-a1b3g5 , corresponding to the collapsed models of a1b3 , have values of @xmath7 less than 0.07 , far smaller than the @xmath7 s of our collapsed model i ( see table  [ tab : prop ] ) , indicating that the eos of the collapsed objects also play an important role on the final equilibrium configurations ( or that their analysis violates one of our assumptions ) .    figures  [ deni]-[deniii ] show the density contours of the collapsed objects .",
    "we see that the contours of the dense central region look like the contours of a typical rotating star .",
    "as we go out to the low density region , the shapes of the contours become more and more disk - like . eventually , the contours turn into torus - like shapes for densities lower than @xmath89 . in all cases ,",
    "the objects contain two regions : a dense central core of size about 20  km and a low density torus - like envelope extending out to 1000  km from the rotation axis . since we truncate the @xmath90-curve , we can not determine accurately the actual boundary of the stars .",
    "the contours shown in these figures have been checked to move less than one per cent as the cutoff @xmath91 is changed from 0.7 to 0.9 .",
    "this little change is hardly visible at the displayed scales .",
    "figure  [ freq ] shows the rotational frequency @xmath92 as a function of @xmath43 , the distance from the rotation axis .",
    "we see that the cores of the cold models are close to rigid rotation .",
    "the rotation periods of the cores of the cold neutron stars are all about 1.4  ms , slightly less than the period of the fastest observed millisecond pulsar ( 1.56  ms ) .",
    "a further analysis reveals that @xmath93 in the region @xmath94 , where @xmath95 for the cold models and @xmath96 for the hot models .    to gain an insight into the structure of the envelope",
    ", we define the kepler frequency @xmath97 at a given point on the equator as the angular frequency required for a particle to be completely supported by centrifugal force , i.e.  @xmath97 satisfies the equation @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration at that point . figure  [ freq - ratio ] plots @xmath100 as a function of @xmath43 along the equator . for",
    "the cold models , the curves increase from 0.5 at the centre to a maximum of about 0.95 at @xmath101 , then decrease to a local minimum of about @xmath102 , and then gradually increase in the outer region .",
    "the curves of the hot models , on the other hand , increase monotonically from about 0.4 at the centre to over 0.7 in the outer region . in all cases",
    ", centrifugal force plays an important role in the structure of the stars , especially in the low density region .",
    "figure  [ fig : mpm ] plots the cylindrical mass fraction @xmath103 as a function of @xmath43",
    ". in all cases the cores contain most of the stars mass .",
    "material in the region @xmath104 occupies only a few per cent of the total mass , but it is massive enough that its self - gravity can not be neglected in order to compute the structure of the envelope accurately .",
    "the envelope can be regarded as a massive , self - gravitating accretion torus .",
    "the same structure is also observed in the core collapse simulations of janka & mnchmeyer and fryer & heger ( private communication with fryer ) .",
    "figure  [ tow ] shows @xmath105 as a function of @xmath43 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy inside the cylinder of radius @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath108 the values of @xmath109 approach @xmath7 when @xmath110 for the cold eos models and when @xmath94 for the hot eos models .",
    "this suggests that material in the region @xmath94 contains negligible amount of kinetic energy , and any instability developed in this region could not produce strong gravitational waves .",
    "we first consider axisymmetric instabilities , i.e. axisymmetric collapse .",
    "this stability is verified when we construct the models . recall that we start from the model of a non - rotating spherical star which is stable .",
    "then we use it as an initial guess to build a sequence of rotating stellar models with the same specific angular momentum distribution but different total masses and angular momenta .",
    "if the final model we end up with is unstable against axisymmetric perturbations , there must be at least one model in the sequence such that @xmath111 which signals the onset of instability @xcite . here",
    "@xmath112 is the total mass and @xmath29 is the central density .",
    "the partial derivative is evaluated by keeping the total angular momentum @xmath76 and specific angular momentum distribution @xmath90 fixed .",
    "we have verified that all of our equilibrium models in the sequencies satisfy @xmath113 .",
    "hence they are all stable against axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we next consider non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "we have @xmath114 for the cold eos models and @xmath115 for the hot eos models ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) .",
    "the hot models are probably dynamically stable but may be secularly unstable .",
    "however , since they are evolving to cold neutron stars in about 20  s and their structures are continually changing on times comparable to the secular timescale , we shall not discuss secular instabilities of these hot models here .",
    "the values of @xmath7 for the three cold neutron stars are slightly less than the traditional critical value for dynamical instability , @xmath10 .",
    "this critical value is based on simulations of differentially rotating polytropes having the @xmath90-distribution of maclaurin spheroids .",
    "however , recent simulations demonstrate that differentially rotating polytropes having other @xmath90-distributions can be dynamically unstable for values of @xmath7 as low as 0.14 @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of some of those unstable stars also contain a low density accretion disk like structure in the stars outer layers .",
    "this feature is very similar to the equilibrium structure of our models .",
    "hence a more detailed study has to be carried out to determine whether the cold models are dynamically stable .",
    "the subsequent evolution of a bar - unstable object has been studied for the past 15 years @xcite .",
    "it is found that a bar - like structure develops in a dynamical timescale .",
    "however , it is still not certain whether the bar structure would be persistent , giving rise to a long - lived gravitational wave signal , or material would be shed from the ends of the bar after tens of rotation periods , leaving an axisymmetric , dynamically bar - stable central star .    even if the cold neutron stars are dynamically stable , they are subject to various secular instabilities .",
    "the timescale of the gravitational - wave - driven bar - mode instability can be estimated by @xmath116 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "@xmath117 ( see figure  [ tow ] ) , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , so @xmath120 .",
    "gravitational waves may also drive the r - mode instability @xcite .",
    "the timescale is estimated by @xmath121 for the @xmath122 r - mode at low temperatures @xcite , where @xmath123 is the average density .",
    "inserting @xmath123 for the inner 20-km cores of the cold stars , we have @xmath124 . the evolution of the bar - mode secular instability has only been studied in detail for the maclaurin spheroids .",
    "these objects evolve through a sequence of deformed non - axisymmetric configurations eventually to settle down as a more slowly rotating stable axisymmetric star @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that stars having more realistic eos will behave similarly .",
    "we have constructed equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars which model the end products of the accretion induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs .",
    "we considered three models for the pre - collapse white dwarfs .",
    "all of them are rigidly rotating at the maximum possible angular velocities .",
    "the white dwarfs are described by the eos of degenerate electrons at zero temperature with coulomb corrections derived by salpeter .",
    "we assumed that ( 1 ) the collapsed objects are axisymmetric and are in rotational equilibrium with no meridional circulation , ( 2 ) the eos is barotropic , ( 3 ) viscosity can be neglected , and ( 4 ) any ejected material carries negligible amounts of mass and angular momentum .",
    "we then built the equilibrium models of the collapsed stars based on the fact that their final configurations must have the same masses , total angular momenta and specific angular momentum distributions , @xmath90 , as the pre - collapse white dwarfs .",
    "two eos have been used for the collapsed objects .",
    "one of them is one of the standard cold neutron - star eos .",
    "the other is a hot eos suitable for protoneutron stars , which are characterized by their high temperature and high lepton fraction .",
    "the equilibrium structure of the collapsed objects in all of our models consist of a high density central core of size about 20  km , surrounded by a massive accretion torus extending over 1000  km from the rotation axis .",
    "more than 90 per cent of the stellar mass is contained in the core and core - torus transition region , which is within about 100  km from the rotation axis ( see figure  [ fig : mpm ] ) .",
    "the central densities of the hot protoneutron stars are in the sub - nuclear density regime ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the structures of these protoneutron stars are very different from those of the cold neutron stars , which the protoneutron stars will evolve to in roughly 20  s. the protoneutron stars have lower central densities , rotate less rapidly , and have smaller values of @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the structures of the three cold neutron stars are similar .",
    "their central densities are around @xmath126 and their central cores are nearly rigidly rotating with periods of about 1.4  ms , slightly less than the fastest observed millisecond pulsar ( 1.56  ms ) .",
    "zwerger and mller performed 2d simulations of the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "the major difference between their models and ours is that they used rather simplified eos for both the pre - collapse and the collapsed models .",
    "when compared with their fastest rigidly rotating model , alb3 , we found their pre - collapse star has less total angular momentum and smaller @xmath7 than the pre - collapse white dwarf of our model  i , although both have the same central density .",
    "the differences between their final collapsed models ( a1b3g1-a1b3g5 ) and ours are even more significant .",
    "the values of @xmath7 of our collapsed objects are much larger than theirs , suggesting that the eos plays an important role in the equilibrium configurations of both the pre - collapse white dwarfs and the resulting collapsed stars .",
    "the values of @xmath7 of the cold neutron stars are only slightly less than the traditional critical value of dynamical instability , 0.27 , frequently quoted in the literature .",
    "the cold neutron stars may still be dynamically unstable and a detailed study is required to settle the issue .",
    "even if they are dynamically stable , they are still subject to various kinds of secular instabilities .",
    "a rough estimate suggests that the gravitational - wave driven bar - mode instability dominates .",
    "the timescale of this instability is about 0.1  s."

    "<S> the models are built in a two - step procedure : ( 1 ) a rapidly rotating pre - collapse white dwarf model is constructed ; ( 2 ) a stationary axisymmetric neutron star having the same total mass and angular momentum distribution as the white dwarf is constructed . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting collapsed objects consist of a high density central core of size roughly 20  km , surrounded by a massive accretion torus extending over 1000  km from the rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational potential energy of these neutron stars ranges from 0.13 to 0.26 , suggesting that some of these objects may have a non - axisymmetric dynamical instability that could emit a significant amount of gravitational radiation .    </S>",
