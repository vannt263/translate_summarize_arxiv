    "<S> b 119 , 11052 ( 2015 ) ] the effect of size polydispersity on the nature of lennard - jones ( lj ) liquids , which represent most molecular liquids without hydrogen bonds , was studied . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , it was shown that even highly size polydisperse lj liquids are roskilde - simple ( rs ) liquids . </S>",
    "<S> rs liquids are liquids with strong correlation between constant volume equilibrium fluctuations of virial and potential energy and are simpler than other types of liquids . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it was shown that size polydisperse lj liquids have isomorphs to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of rs liquids along which structure , dynamics , and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in dimensionless ( reduced ) units . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the effect of energy polydispersity on the nature of lj liquids . </S>",
    "<S> we show that energy polydisperse lj liquids are rs liquids </S>",
    "<S> . however , a tendency of particle segregation which increases with the degree of polydispersity leads to a loss of strong virial - potential energy correlation , but is mitigated with increasing temperature and/or density . </S>",
    "<S> isomorphs are a good approximation also for energy polydisperse lj liquids , although particle - resolved quantities display a somewhat poorer scaling compared to the mean quantities along the isomorph . </S>"
