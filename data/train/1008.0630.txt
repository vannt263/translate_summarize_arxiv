    "cat states and their generalizations are known to achieve heisenberg limited sensitivity in estimation of parameters like coordinate / momentum displacements and phase space rotations @xcite . a criterion to distinguish quantum states without classical counterparts , from those without the same , are studied in @xcite . for these non - classical states , subtle interference effects in the phase space @xcite lead to sub - planck structures in their wigner functions , which in turn allow precision measurement of quantum parameters , bettering the standard quantum limit .",
    "sub - planck structures in different physical systems have been recently investigated @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the sensitivity of the state used in quantum metrology is directly related to the area of the sub - planck structures : @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the action of the effective support of the wigner function .",
    "the interference in phase space is a pure quantum phenomenon , arising due to the fact that these states are superposition of the coherent states ( css ) , which themselves are classical .",
    "the increase in the number of interfering coherent states in the phase space is akin to emergence of diffraction in classical optics , when the number of interfering sources becomes large .    here",
    ", we analyze this diffraction limit of the sub - planck structures and find an exact asymptotic value of the displacement sensitivity . with the assumption of large phase - space support for the estimating state and smallness of the quantum parameters to be estimated , it is found that the asymptotic limit of the sensitivity reaches @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the first root of @xmath4 , the @xmath5 order bessel function .",
    "we explicitly show that this assumption is adequate to adapt realistic values of the physical parameters ; _ i.e. _ , the average photon number and the number of superposed css .",
    "the numerical analysis depicts how the asymptotic limit of exact overlap function ( of ) reaches to the @xmath5 order bessel function for higher order mesoscopic superpositions .",
    "this limiting behaviour in the phase space interference is found to be the exact analog of the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite , relating the mutual coherence in classical optics to diffraction .",
    "cat states and their generalizations play a significant role in quantum optics and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental schemes exist to produce cat states in laboratory conditions @xcite .",
    "these `` pointer states''@xcite often naturally manifest , when suitable quantum systems are coupled with decohering environment .",
    "it has been observed that the robustness of these states , made out of classical css , is a result of `` quantum darwinism '' @xcite .",
    "we consider a single oscillator , with the cs being an eigen state of @xmath6 : @xmath7 , with annihilation and creation operator @xmath6 and @xmath8 : @xmath9=1 $ ] .",
    "the generalized cat state is composed of css , equally phase displaced on a circle : @xmath10 where , @xmath11 , with the displacement operator , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the displacements in the coordinate and momenta can be realized through an appropriately displaced cat state @xcite : @xmath14 . for checking the sensitivity of the estimating state @xmath15 ,",
    "one computes the overlap of the same with the displaced state and studies the orthogonality conditions ,    @xmath16    where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the entire contribution of the of mainly originates from the adjacent components of the original and displaced cat states , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21 . therefore , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24",

    "( [ over2 ] ) takes the simpler form @xmath25.\\label{over4}\\ ] ] apparently , the off - diagonal terms in the above expression are only significant for higher order superpositions ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "now , with the assumption of large phase - space support for the estimating state and smallness of quantum parameters to be estimated , one can neglect the off - diagonal terms and obtain @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\    & \\approx & \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{j=1}^{n } cos\\left[2r sin(\\theta-\\frac{2\\pi j}{n})\\right]\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phase space of the generalized cat state of eq .",
    "[ cat ] is composed of ` @xmath28 ' css , equally placed in a circle of radius @xmath29 , where large phase space support means the large magnitude of @xmath29 .    in this context , we must emphasize more on the domain of validity of the above assumption .",
    "[ offdiag ] depicts the contribution of the off - diagonal terms of eq .",
    "( [ over1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ over2 ] ) .",
    "it becomes significant only after very large value of @xmath28 or when @xmath30 ratio is approximately two for a fixed phase space support .",
    "increasing @xmath28 or producing a higher order superposition is quite difficult in experiments , as it requires a large nonlinearity of the medium . on the contrary",
    ", the absolute value of @xmath31 is directly related to the average photon number of the coherent state , which can be manipulated by controlling the laser beam .",
    "hence , the allowed maximum order of mesoscopic superposition ( ` @xmath28 ' ) for a given @xmath31 , conforming our assumption , is sufficiently large in reality .",
    "it needs to be mentioned that the state overlap depends only on @xmath32 , which leads to the conclusion that the sensitivity of estimating @xmath33 is inversely proportional to @xmath29 . for convenience , we assume @xmath28 is even : @xmath34.\\ ] ]    it is easily checked that the of , being of interferometric origin , is only sensitive to the difference in phase : @xmath35 .",
    "the of for @xmath36 , @xmath37 matches with the known result @xcite , with @xmath38 . as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure ] , it is interesting to observe that the above expression is analogous to the double slit interference pattern , where the normalized intensity can be written as @xmath39 @xcite . the path difference between the two waves reaching at the observation point is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 defines the distance between the two slits , @xmath42 is the separation between the aperture and the screen , and @xmath43 corresponds to the vertical coordinate of the detector .",
    "the above analogy can be mathematically established by taking @xmath44 in the unit of @xmath42 and redefining the commutation relation , @xmath9 = \\pi \\lambda^{-1}$ ] : @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the separation of the two coherent state sources .",
    "use of the phase shifted cat state , @xmath47 , would yield an interference pattern at an angle @xmath48 and _ fringe width _ , @xmath49 : @xmath50 introducing a phase between the constituent css of a cat state with @xmath36 gives the state @xmath51 .",
    "the of for this state is @xmath52 akin to the phenomenon of `` _ _ fringe shift _ _ '' observed in classical optics .",
    "we now derive the asymptotic limit to the state overlap and sensitivity in parameter estimation , @xmath53 this proves our assertion that states can be discriminated for @xmath2 due to orthogonality , where @xmath3 is a root of the bessel function ( of first kind ) of order zero , @xmath54 @xmath4 .    ) or ( [ over2 ] ) ) for superposition of four coherent states ( dashed line ) , superposition of six coherent states ( small - dashed line ) , superposition of eight coherent states ( dot - dashed line ) , and superposition of sixteen coherent states ( dotted line ) . for larger value of @xmath28 ,",
    "the of gradually coincides with the zeroth order bessel function ( solid line ) . here ,",
    "@xmath55 for all the cases . ]",
    "although we have already discussed about the reliability of our assumption before ( see fig .  [ offdiag ] ) , we want to further check , whether the above result is still valid for the general of in eq .",
    "( [ over1 ] ) or ( [ over2 ] ) .",
    "we provide fig .",
    "[ overall ] for numerical delineation , which clearly shows the agreement of the zeroth order bessel function for higher order mesoscopic superposition .",
    "hence , the experimental parameter domain is well in the range of our previous assumption , where eq .",
    "( [ bessel ] ) is valid .    the asymptotic overlap function [ eq .  ( [ bessel ] ) ] is the result of coherent superposition of @xmath56css situated in a ring of radius @xmath31 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the ring behaves as a ringed shaped light source with constant angular source strength . hence .",
    "the superposition is analogous to the diffraction pattern generated when light passes through the thin ring shaped opening .",
    "the fact that the overlap between the cat states and their shifted forms , is of the same form as the diffraction pattern centered at one of the states , bears strong resemblance to the van cittert - zernike theorem @xcite , where the normalized mutual coherence function @xmath58 between two points is identical to diffraction pattern centered at one of the points . for a ring shaped opening with constant angular source strength ,",
    "one can write explicitly @xmath59 @xmath58 actually signifies the complex degree of spatial coherence of the two points at the same instant in time , when fields arriving at the observation screen being @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "@xmath62 is the radius of ring , @xmath63 is the distance of the screen from the opening and @xmath64 is the path difference between the points .",
    "the suffix @xmath65 in the expectation value signifies the time average according to the ergodic hypothesis .",
    "the above equation should be compared with the of for large @xmath28 ( eq .  [ bessel ] ) , for unit distance from the screen to the opening ( @xmath66 ) and for @xmath9 = \\pi \\lambda^{-1}$ ] : @xmath67 indicates that the maximum contribution of each term is @xmath68 and minimum @xmath69 , which arise , if and only if , either @xmath70 and @xmath71 commute(@xmath68 ) or anti- commute(@xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , the state is indistinguishable from its shifted form , if and only if , displacement operators corresponding to all the constituent states of the cat state commute with @xmath71 or all anti- commute with it .",
    "in conclusion , the sensitivity of cat - like states to quantum parameter estimation is studied for large number of constituent css .",
    "the assumption of large phase space support is justified for accessible parameter ranges in realistic situation . in this limit , the state of , determining the orthogonality of cat and displaced cat states , approaches the bessel function . according to the van cittert - zernike theorem , the coherence problem is mathematically identical with the diffraction problem by complex degree of coherence .",
    "the fact that the of is having the same form as the diffraction pattern results the same expression of normalized mutual coherence function for large @xmath28 .",
    "this is similar to the mutual coherence function of a circular ring , which yields bessel function of order zero , matching with the theorem of van cittert - zernike .",
