    "neutrino - nucleus scattering has gained in recent years a wide interest that goes beyond the study of the intrinsic properties of neutrinos and extends to different fields , such as astrophysics , cosmology , particle and nuclear physics .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillations and the proposal and realization of new experiments , aimed at determining neutrino properties with high accuracy , renewed interest in neutrino scattering on complex nuclei .",
    "in fact , neutrino detectors contain nuclei and a detailed knowledge of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is necessary for a proper interpretation of the experimental data . neutrino - nucleus scattering , however , is not only an useful tool to detect neutrinos , but plays an important role also in understanding various astrophysical processes .",
    "the influence of neutrinos extends to cosmological questions .",
    "moreover , neutrinos provide a suitable tool to test the limits of the standard model , the properties of the weak interaction and for investigating nuclear structure . in hadronic and",
    "nuclear physics neutrinos can give information on the structure of the hadronic weak current and on the strange quark contribution to the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "thus , neutrino physics is of great interest and involves many different phenomena .",
    "the problem is that neutrinos are elusive particles .",
    "they are chargeless , almost massless , and only weakly interacting .",
    "their presence can only be inferred detecting the particles they create when colliding or interacting with matter .",
    "nuclei are often used as neutrino detectors providing relatively large cross sections .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of data requires reliable calculations where nuclear effects are properly taken into account .",
    "general review papers about neutrino - nucleus interactions can be found in @xcite . both weak neutral - current",
    "( nc ) and charged - current ( cc ) scattering have stimulated detailed analyses in the intermediate - energy region @xcite using a variety of methods , including fermi gas ( fg ) , random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) and shell - model ( sm ) calculations .",
    "the effects of final state interactions ( fsi ) were investigated within the relativistic fg ( rfg ) model @xcite , the rpa @xcite and in the continuum rpa ( crpa ) theory @xcite .",
    "nuclear structure effects on the determination of the strange quark contribution in nc scattering were studied in @xcite , and in @xcite in the framework of a relativistic plane wave impulse approximation ( rpwia ) .",
    "the effects of fsi on the ratio of proton - to - neutron cross sections in nc scattering were discussed in @xcite .",
    "we study cc and nc @xmath0- and @xmath1-nucleus scattering in the qe region . in this region",
    "the dominant contribution is given by one - nucleon knockout processes , where the interaction occurs on a nucleon , that is bound in the nucleus but is assumed to be a quasi - free nucleon in the process , this nucleon is emitted and the remaining nucleons are spectators . in the qe region",
    "we have applied the same relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) model that was successfully tested in comparison with data for the exclusive ( e , e@xmath2p ) knockout reaction @xcite .",
    "the analysis of nc @xmath0-nucleus reactions , however , introduces additional complications , as the final neutrino can not be measured in practice and a final hadron has to be detected : the corresponding cross sections are therefore semi - inclusive in the hadronic sector and inclusive in the leptonic one .",
    "the same approach is here applied to the cc scattering where only the outgoing nucleon is detected .",
    "the case of the inclusive cc scattering where only the outgoing charged lepton is detected was studied in @xcite through a relativistic green s function approach , that was firstly applied to the inclusive qe electron scattering @xcite and where fsi are accounted for by means of a complex optical potential but without loss of flux .",
    "the formalism is outlined in sec .",

    "the effects of the strange nucleon form factors and their possible determination are investigated sec .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the @xmath0(@xmath1)-nucleus cross section for the process where one nucleon is emitted is given , in the one - boson exchange approximation , by the contraction between the lepton and the hadron tensor , i.e. , @xmath3 where @xmath4 mev@xmath5 is the fermi constant , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the four - momentum of the incident and final leptons , respectively , and @xmath8 is the momentum of the emitted nucleon . for cc processes @xmath9 has to be multiplied by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "the lepton tensor @xmath12 has a similar structure as in electron scattering and separates into a symmetrical and an antisymmetrical part @xcite .",
    "the components of the lepton tensor are kinematical factors which depend only on the lepton kinematics .",
    "the components of the hadron tensor are given by bilinear products of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear weak - current operator @xmath13 between the initial state @xmath14 of the nucleus , of energy @xmath15 , and the final states , of energy @xmath16 , that are given by the product of a discrete ( or continuum ) state @xmath17 of the residual nucleus and a scattering state @xmath18 of the emitted nucleon , with momentum @xmath8 and energy @xmath19 : @xmath20 where the sum runs over all the states of the residual nucleus .",
    "in the first order perturbation theory and using the impulse approximation , the transition amplitude is assumed to be adequately described as the sum of terms similar to those appearing in the exclusive ( e , e@xmath2p ) knockout reaction @xcite @xmath21 the transition amplitudes are thus obtained in a one - body representation and contain three ingredients : the one - body nuclear weak current @xmath22 , the one - nucleon overlap function @xmath23 , that is a single - particle ( s.p . ) bound state wave function , and the s.p .",

    "the single differential cross section with respect to the outgoing nucleon kinetic energy @xmath52 is obtained after integrating over the energy and angle of the final lepton and over the solid angle of the final nucleon .    in the calculations",

    "the cross section for the @xmath0(@xmath1)-nucleus scattering where only one - nucleon is detected is obtained from the sum of all the integrated exclusive one - nucleon knockout channels .",
    "fsi are described by means of a complex optical potential whose imaginary part gives an absorption that reduces the calculated cross section .",
    "it accounts for the flux lost in a particular channel and that goes towards other channels .",
    "this approach is conceptually correct for an exclusive reaction , where only one channel contributes , but it would be conceptually wrong for an inclusive reaction , where all the channels contribute and the total flux must be conserved . in fact , for the inclusive electron scattering @xcite and for the cc scattering where only the outgoing lepton is detected @xcite we adopt a different treatment of fsi , which makes use of a complex optical potential and where the total flux is conserved . here , we consider semi - inclusive situations where an emitted nucleon is always detected and some of the reaction channels which are responsible for the imaginary part of the optical potential , like fragmentation of the nucleus , re - absorption , etc . , are not included in the experimental cross section . from this point of view , it is correct to include the absorptive imaginary part of the optical potential .",
    "there are , however , contributions that are not included in our model and that can be included in the experimental cross section , for instance , contributions due to multi - step processes , where the outgoing nucleon is re - emitted after re - scattering in a detected channel simulating the kinematics of a qe reaction .",
    "the relevance of these contributions depends on kinematics and should not be too large in the situations considered in this paper .",
    "anyhow , even if the use of an optical potential with an absorptive imaginary part can introduce some uncertainties in the comparison with data , we deem it a more correct and clearer way to evaluate the effects of fsi .",
    "calculations have been performed for nc and cc @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) scattering from @xmath56c in an energy range between 500 and 1000 mev , where one - nucleon knockout is expected to be the most important contribution . in this section nuclear effects",
    "are investigated in calculations where the strange form factors are neglected .",
    "the effects of the strange nucleon form factors are discussed in the next section .",
    "nuclear effects are included in the phenomenological ingredients for the bound and scattering states .",
    "calculations performed with different bound state wave functions and with different optical potentials are not very sensitive to the choice and to the details of the phenomenological ingredients .",
    "large effects are , however , produced by fsi .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , where the cross sections of the @xmath56c@xmath57 and @xmath56c@xmath58 cc reactions and of the @xmath56c@xmath59 and @xmath56c@xmath60 nc reactions are compared in rpwia and rdwia at @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev .",
    "fsi reduce the cross sections of @xmath63% .",
    "this reduction is due to the imaginary part of the optical potential and is in agreement with the reduction found in the ( e , e@xmath2p ) calculations .",
    "we note that the cross sections for an incident neutrino are larger than for an incident antinuetrino .",

    "it is well known that the net strangeness of the nucleon is zero .",
    "it is also known , however , that according to the quantum field theory in the cloud of a physical nucleon there must be pairs of strange particles . from the viewpoint of qcd",
    "the nucleon consists of @xmath65 and @xmath66 quarks and of a sea of @xmath67 pairs produced by virtual gluons .",
    "then , the question is : how do the sea quarks , in particular strange quarks , contribute to the observed properties of the nucleon ?",
    "the first evidence that the constant @xmath68 , that characterizes the matrix element of the axial strange current , is different from zero and large was found by the emc experiment at cern @xcite , in a measurement of deep inelastic scattering of polarized muons on polarized protons .",

    "the strange form factors , @xmath72 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , can be investigated in nc @xmath0 scattering and in parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) .",

    "in contrast , nc @xmath0 scattering is primarily sensitive to @xmath73 .",
    "the interference with the strange vector form factors can be resolved by complementary experiments of pves .",
    "a determination of the form factors is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "our main aim here is to study the sensitivity of nc @xmath0-nucleus scattering to the strange quark contribution . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "the cross sections calculated , both for proton and neutron emission , with a particular choice for the values of the parameters , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , are compared with the results obtained without strange form factors .",

    "thus , ratios of cross sections were proposed as an alternative way to extract @xmath47 . difficulties due to the determination of the absolute neutrino flux are reduced in the ratios . moreover , also nuclear effects can be strongly reduced in the ratios .",
    "the effects of fsi are large on the cross sections and almost negligible in the ratios , where they give a similar contribution to the numerator and to the denominator @xcite . in contrast",
    ", strangeness effects can be emphasized in the ratios , where form factors may contribute in a different way , for instance with a different sign , in the numerator and in the denominator .",
    "two different ratios are presented in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the ratio of proton - to - neutron ( p / n ) nc cross sections is sensitive to the strange - quark contribution as the interference between @xmath47 and @xmath84 contributes with an opposite sign in the numerator and in the denominator [ see eq . ( [ eq.ga ] ) ] .",
    "a precise measurement of this ratio appears , however , problematic due to the difficulties associated with neutron detection . a measurement of the ratio of the nc - to - cc ( nc / cc ) cross sections appears more feasible and will be measured at finesse @xcite . although sensitive to strangeness only in the numerator , the nc / cc ratio is simply related to the number of events with an outgoing proton and a missing mass with respect to the events with an outgoing proton in coincidence with a muon .",
    "the ratios in figure  [ fig3 ] are sensitive to @xmath47 and @xmath44 , while the effects of @xmath43 are very small .",
