    "kes 79 ( g33.6 + 0.1 ) is a galactic snr with appreciable x - ray and radio structure ( frail & clifton 1989 ; seward & velusamy 1995 ) . in the radio band , there is an incomplete outer shell from the southwest to the west with a radius of @xmath0 6@xmath1 and two prominent indentations in the east and northeast .",
    "the radio emission from the center is bright , composed of an `` inner ring '' and many knots ( frail & clifton 1989 ) .",
    "strong @xmath2co j=1@xmath30 emission and hco@xmath4 j=1@xmath30 emission ( scoville et al .",
    "1987 ; green & dewdney 1992 ) were found at the system velocity of the remnant ( @xmath0 105 km s@xmath5 ) , located east and southeast of kes 79 .",
    "green & dewdney ( 1992 ) conclude that these imply an interaction of the remnant with adjacent molecular clouds .",
    "frail & clifton ( 1989 ) measured a hi kinematic distance of 10@xmath62 kpc for kes 79 .",
    "case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) used a new galactic rotation curve to revise this distance to 7.1 kpc .",
    "observations show kes 79 has strong central shell - like emission and diffuse faint emission extended to the radio outer shell ( seward & velusamy 1995 ) .",
    "most x - ray emission is from a bright diffuse inner region where there are also bright radio filaments .",
    "spectra of kes 79 show strong mg , si , s and fe - l lines and the global spectrum can be fitted well by a single nei model ( sun & wang 2000 ; tsunemi & enoguchi 2002 ) .",
    "kes 79 was listed as a possible mixed - morphology snr by rho & petre ( 1998 ) but the unusual double - shell structure ( seward & velusamy 1995 ) and x - ray / radio bright structures around the center imply something unique .",
    "we obtained a  ao-2 30 ks observation of kes 79 in 2001 .",
    "a preceding paper ( seward et al . 2003 ; s03 hereafter ) describes the discovery of a compact central object ( cco ) which implies that the remnant has a massive star progenitor .",
    "this paper concerns the thermal diffuse emission .",
    "the  data reduction is described in @xmath72 .",
    "spatial features detected in this observation are discussed in @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 describes the x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "@xmath75 is the discussion and @xmath76 is the conclusion . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use a distance d = 7.1 kpc .",
    "thus , 1@xmath1 = 2.06 pc .",
    "dimensions , luminosities , densities , and masses scale as d , d@xmath8 , d@xmath9 , and d@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the  observation is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the aimpoint is on the normal position of the i3 ccd .",
    "we generally follow the ciao science threads for the  data reduction .",
    "the data were telemetered in faint mode and events with  grades 1 , 5 and 7 were excluded .",
    "known bad columns , hot pixels , and ccd node boundaries also were excluded .",
    "after removal of background flares , the effective exposure is 29.3 ks .",
    "we applied the cxc correction for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) .",
    "the slow gain changes in acis ccds i0-i3 were also corrected using the program ` corr_tgain ' by a. vikhlinin . without this correction , offsets between the observed line centroid and models were observed , which degrade fits significantly .",
    "this correction significantly improves fits but has only a small effect on best - fit temperatures ( within 5% ) . an empirical correction to the acis low energy quantum efficiency ( qe )",
    "degradation was performed .",
    "the effective area below 1.8 kev in the front - illuminated ccds was corrected by a factor of 0.93 to improve the cross - calibration with the back - illuminated ccds .",
    "the response files were produced by calcrmf and calcarf .",
    "it is crucial to subtract background properly for the analysis of extended sources .",
    "the observed region is located in the galactic plane .",
    "thus , we have to properly subtract the `` galactic ridge '' emission ( e.g. , warwick et al .",
    "1985 ; kaneda et al .",
    "we can not simply subtract the standard acis blank sky background because it is for high galactic latitude regions .",
    "although parts of the acis - i chips are source - free , we can not simply use the spectrum of those regions as background spectrum because the detector response varies across the ccds .",
    "therefore , we used a `` double subtraction '' method to subtract background in the spectral analysis .",
    "similar methods have been applied to clusters ( e.g. , markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 ) .",
    "we extracted the spectrum from regions outside of the remnant ( excluding point sources ) .",
    "first , we used the high - latitude blank sky background ( particle background + cosmic x - ray background , without `` galactic ridge '' emission ) to do the first subtraction .",
    "the normalization of the blank sky background was scaled up 8% based on the observed count rate in pha channel 2500 - 3000 adu .",
    "this first subtraction enables the removal of particle background from the spectra .",
    "the residual is the vignetted `` galactic ridge '' emission plus over - subtracted cxb because of the high absorption in the direction of kes 79 .",
    "second , we fit the residual with an arbitrary model ( power law + some gaussians ) .",
    "the fit is satisfactory with @xmath11 of about 1.2 .",
    "this model was taken as the `` background residual model '' .",
    "for the spectra from each region , we first subtract the blank sky background , and then subtract the residual background with the best - fit model derived above .",
    "the normalization of the model is determined by the solid angle of the region of interest .",
    "the uncertainty of the background residual model is also included in the uncertainties of the derived properties ( e.g. , temperature , absorption and abundances ) .",
    "ciao 2.2.1 , ftools 5.1 , xspec 11.2 and spex 2.0 were used for data analysis .",
    "the calibration data used was caldb 2.23 from the cxc .",
    "the uncertainties in this paper are 90% confidence intervals unless specified otherwise .",
    "the  0.5 - 3 kev exposure - corrected image of kes 79 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . with the angular resolution of , filaments , multiple shells and loops are revealed .",
    "most of the x - ray emission is from the central region but there is no x - ray enhancement around the central point source .",
    "the bright inner shell is fragmented , as are the bright filaments . just outside the bright inner shell",
    ", there are two faint arcs which we name `` middle shell '' .",
    "the arc of this middle shell is short .",
    "it only exists in the west and seems to merge with the inner shell in the south .",
    "narrow - band images centered at the mg , si and s emission lines were also extracted and do not show appreciable differences from the broadband image .",
    "there are many similarities between the radio and x - ray images .",
    "a radio image of kes 79 is shown in fig .",
    "3 shows an adaptively smoothed exposure - corrected x - ray image with radio contours superposed . the faint x - ray outer shell and a northeastern `` protrusion ''",
    "are clearly revealed .",
    "the x - ray outer shell well matches the radio outer shell , which is the expected signature of the blast - wave .",
    "the x - ray `` protrusion '' is also coincident with a radio `` protrusion '' , which is probably a relatively low density region between eastern clouds .",
    "the eastern radio limb also matches x - ray filaments .",
    "some of the radio bright clumps around the center ( but not all ) also match x - ray bright regions . at the x - ray middle shell",
    ", there is an excess of radio emission , which may imply compression by shocks so that the particle energy density and magnetic field are amplified .",
    "however , we also notice a radio - dim region filled with x - ray bright filaments to the east of the central point source .",
    "the central  point source ( s03 ) , is close to the geometric center of the remnant in both x - ray and radio ( fig . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "however , it is neither at the center defined by the radio / x - ray outer shell , nor the center defined by x - ray bright inner shell and middle shell ( fig . 1 and 2 ) , which is 1@xmath1 - 1.5@xmath1 to the northeast .",
    "because the south - west ( sw ) of the remnant is more radially ordered than other parts , we measured the radial surface brightness profiles in two sw sectors ( sw # 1 and sw # 2 , fig .",
    "4 ) . three discontinuities ( the inner , middle and outer shells ) are present in sw # 2 , while only two ( the inner and outer shells ) are present in sw # 1 . thus , there are three apparent shells in a small portion of the remnant ( west to southwest ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the outer shell in the two sectors agrees well .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry of the x - ray emission in these two sectors and perform the deprojection to obtain the electron density , a technique broadly applied in galaxy cluster studies ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "the x - ray gas filling factor is assumed unity .",
    "the temperature and abundances in corresponding regions are used to derive the x - ray emissivity .",
    "the density of the outer shell is @xmath0 0.3 - 0.4 @xmath12 , while that of the inner shell is @xmath0 2 @xmath12 ( all for a filling factor of unity ) .",
    "density jumps with factors of 2 - 4 occur across the discontinuities .",
    "we first want to investigate the average spectral properties of kes 79 and compare with those derived from previous observations , e.g. , .",
    "the method of background subtraction was discussed in @xmath72 .",
    "the global  0.8 - 6 kev spectrum of kes 79 is shown in fig .",
    "5 . the emission lines from he - like ne , mg , si and s are significant .",
    "the fe - l blend is also significant as a wide bump between the ne and mg lines .",
    "we first applied collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) models ( e.g. , vequil in xspec ) to fit the spectrum , but the fit is very poor ( table 2 ) .",
    "we then applied two nei codes broadly used now , vnei ( version 1.1 ) in xspec 11.2 and nei in spex 2.0 , to model the spectra . the same abundance table ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) was used in the two codes .",
    "absorption , temperature , ionization timescale , and abundances of ne , mg , si , s and fe are free parameters in models , while the abundances of other elements are fixed at their solar values .",
    "the fits are much better than the cie fit ( table 2 ) .",
    "the two nei codes produce somewhat different results ( table 2 ) but the spex code fits the observed spectrum better .",
    "the best - fit spex nei model is shown in fig .",
    "the temperature derived from the spex model is 15% higher than that from the xspec model .",
    "the abundances of mg , si and fe from the spex model are also significantly higher .",
    "the discrepancy can not be removed by setting absorptions to be the same since decreasing the absorption in spex fitting will actually increase the best - fit temperature .",
    "the different fe - l atomic data used in the two codes may partially account for the discrepancy ( private communication with j. kaastra ) . at this stage , this systematic difference should be kept in mind when we try to understand the data .",
    "this discrepancy also requires caution to explain the results of nei fits .",
    "we also re - analyzed the  spectrum of kes 79 using the current calibration files .",
    "the b2 mode data from ccd sis0 and sis1 were used .",
    "three nearby galactic plane observations with the same ccd mode were used as background .",
    "source and background spectra were extracted from the same detector region .",
    "the spectra were also fitted by the vequil , vnei ( xspec ) and nei ( spex ) models .",
    "results from sis0 and sis1 agree so we fit them simultaneously ( table 2 ) .",
    "the two nei codes still produce different results .",
    "our results are consistent with those of other  analyses ( sun & wang 2000 applying spex 1.1 on sis0 data ; tsunemi & enoguchi 2002 applying xspec 11.1 on both gis and sis data )",
    ".  results are consistent with  results when the same nei code is applied , except that the  abundances of mg and si are @xmath0 30% higher than  values .    the observed flux and the luminosity of kes 79 are derived from the best - fit of the  global spectrum and the total count rate .",
    "the two nei models still produce different results .",
    "the derived 0.5 - 10 kev flux ( absorbed ) is 1.2 - 1.3 @xmath13 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath15 .",
    "the 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity is 2.3 - 2.8 @xmath13 10@xmath16 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "these values are consistent with those derived from .",
    "the cco only contributes @xmath0 0.13% of the total flux .",
    "we study the spectral variation across the remnant by performing spectral analysis on 14 regions ( fig .",
    "all spectra are similar with three strong emission lines .",
    "none can be fitted well by cie models .",
    "we also applied the two nei codes on these spectra .",
    "the fits are satisfactory with @xmath17 ranging from 0.6 to 1.25 ( for degrees of freedom from 34 to 107 ) .",
    "the derived temperature and absorption distributions are shown in fig .",
    "the temperatures derived from spex fits are still systematically higher than those from xspec fits , while the absorption from spex fits are generally @xmath0 10% higher .",
    "regions 7 and 13 have the lowest surface brightness . if we allow both the temperature and the abundances to vary , the uncertainties are big .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we fix the abundances in regions 7 and 13 to the solar values . for other regions with higher surface brightness",
    ", we also tried to fit their spectra with solar abundances . in those cases ,",
    "the fits can be significantly improved if the abundances are allowed to vary .",
    "regardless of the systematic discrepancy of results from the two codes , there is little temperature variation across the remnant , no matter the geometry and location .",
    "this is surprising since there are rich and different gas features in the remnant , which reflects the complexity of the environment .",
    "this may give rise to a variation of shock velocity in different regions .",
    "thus a nearly isothermal snr is not expected .",
    "the measured ionization timescales are model dependent and have large uncertainties , but are all around 10@xmath18 @xmath12 s@xmath5 .",
    "the spectral fits also show some variation of absorption .",
    "the absorption in the west and northwest is higher than that in the southeast .",
    "if we fix the absorption to the average value , the change of best - fit temperature is at most 10% .    as shown in the global fits ( table 2 )",
    ", the two nei codes produce different mg , si and fe abundances .",
    "a similar discrepancy is observed on fits for individual regions . for the acis spectrum with relatively low spectral resolution , the determination of the abundance is not so robust as that of temperature .",
    "none of the regions show more than 90% significantly different abundances relative to the average values , including the bright inner shell .",
    "this rules out a shocked - ejecta nature of the bright inner shell .",
    "the x - ray bright inner shell and clumps are more likely clouds overrun by the shock and are now cooling and evaporating in the hot post - shock region .",
    "the failure to find ejecta - dominant regions implies that the sn debris is well - mixed with other material .",
    "the effect of thermal conduction in the evolution of snrs is controversial .",
    "conventional wisdom says that thermal conduction is severely suppressed in the disjointed magnetic field , which may be common in snrs .",
    "however , it has been argued that this effect may not be significant in some stages of evolution ( e.g. , cox et al .",
    "1999 ; kawasaki et al . 2002 ) .",
    "chevalier ( 1999 ) also argued that molecular clouds have a significant uniform magnetic field component so that thermal conduction is likely to be important in the hot interior .",
    "cox et al . ( 1999 ) proposed a model to explain x - ray thermal - composite snrs , which depends crucially on efficient thermal conduction to smooth the radial temperature gradient and increase central x - ray brightness .",
    "however , there has been little observational evidence for efficient thermal conduction in snrs .",
    "this  observation of kes 79 may provide such evidence .",
    "the nearly uniform temperature distribution of kes 79 can be used to put a lower limit on thermal conductivity .",
    "the scale length of the temperature gradient is @xmath19 = @xmath20 .",
    "for any two distinct regions ( e.g. , 1 and 3 in fig .",
    "6 ) , @xmath19 should be at least comparable to the separation of two regions ( @xmath0 4 pc for regions 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the electron free path ( @xmath21 ) in kes 79 is 0.2 ( @xmath22 / 0.7 kev)@xmath8 ( @xmath23 / 1 @xmath12)@xmath5 pc , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the remnant .",
    "thus , thermal conduction should be classical on the remnant scale .",
    "on smaller scales , thermal conduction may be saturated especially at the interface between the hot gas and clouds ( e.g. , white & long 1991 ) . assuming the spitzer thermal conductivity , the conduction timescale ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) is : @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the collisional conductivity derived by spitzer ( see the expression for @xmath25 in e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) , and ln @xmath26 is the coulomb logarithm , which is @xmath0 32 for the typical plasma temperature and density in kes 79 . for the typical electron density in the remnant ( 1 @xmath12 ) and typical separation of regions in fig . 6 ( @xmath0 2@xmath1 or 4.1 pc ) , the conduction timescale is @xmath0 6.4 kyr , which is about the age of the remnant ( @xmath75.4 ) .",
    "thus , if we attribute the smooth temperature distribution to the effect of thermal conduction , the thermal conductivity should be close to the spitzer value .",
    "even if heat flux is mainly transported in lower density regions and the uncertainty of the age is considered , the lower limit on the thermal conductivity is @xmath0 1/10 of the spitzer value .    both the radio and x - ray morphology of kes 79 show that it is located in a non - uniform environment and is probably interacting with clouds , which should produce complicated magnetic field structure .",
    "thus , we need to understand why thermal conduction is not significantly suppressed .",
    "narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) show that thermal conductivity can approach one fifth of the spitzer value if the magnetized plasma has chaotic magnetic field fluctuations extended over two or more decades in length scales",
    ". numerical work by chandran & maron ( 2003 ) also shows that thermal conduction is only reduced by a factor of 5 - 10 relative to the spitzer value in the static field approximation .",
    "cho et al . ( 2003 ) used numerical methods to study thermal conduction in magnetized turbulent gas and found no suppression .",
    "thus , from theoretical points of view , thermal conductivity on the level of 1/10 of the spitzer value can be achieved in snrs .",
    "kes 79 may not be the only snr with little temperature variation .",
    "observations of g69.7 + 1.0 ( yoshita et al .",
    "2000 ) , 3c400.2 ( yoshita et al .",
    "2001 ) and 3c391 ( chen & slane 2001 ) also show little temperature variation across the remnants .",
    "however , these  observations only yield spectral information from 2 - 4 regions ( compared to 14 regions used in this work ) . moreover ,",
    "none of them appear to display the rich structure seen in kes 79 .  and",
    "observations could better constrain the temperature variations in these remnants .      the  image of kes",
    "79 clearly shows multi - shell structure , as do the radio images , especially at 5 ghz ( fig . 3 of velusamy et al .",
    "the radio middle shell is at the same azimuth of the x - ray middle shell , but more radially outward .",
    "the good correspondence of radio and x - ray implies that these shells are caused by shock compression .",
    "as shown in the early analysis , none represents the reverse shock .",
    "it is unlikely that the ordered shapes of inner and middle shells are caused by engulfed evaporating cloudlets behind the blast wave .",
    "there are at least two possibilities that may cause the multi - shell structure .",
    "the first is projection .",
    "tenorio - tagle , bodenheimer & yorke ( 1985 ) made simulations on the interaction of snrs with molecular clouds .",
    "if a sn explodes on the outskirts of a molecular cloud , after the shock reaches the edge of the cloud and breaks out , the shock will speed up in the lower density intercloud medium , while the shock in the cloud is still moving slowly .",
    "thus , in the simplest case , we might see two half shells with different radii , where the radius ratio depends on the initial location of the sn event and the density gradient .",
    "if the line of sight is perpendicular to the edge of the cloud , we will see the two shells overlap on the sky creating the appearance of a double shell .",
    "the heavy element abundances of the two shells will be determined by the ism abundance .",
    "this can roughly explain the outer and inner shells and their abundances .",
    "an alternative explanation requires the presence of a wind - driven shell ( wds ) .",
    "the compact source found in the center of kes 79 ( s03 ) implies a massive progenitor .",
    "such massive stars are known to have strong stellar winds during their short lifetimes .",
    "thus , kes 79 may have begun to evolve inside the stellar wind bubble of its progenitor .",
    "the presence of a wds has a significant effect on the evolution and appearance of an snr . if the wds is not very massive , when the sn shock hits the wds , the whole shell expands while the fast - moving blast wave overtakes it and propagates into the undisturbed ambient medium . at the same time",
    ", a reflected shock is expected to form and propagate inwards .",
    "this results in multi - shell structure of the remnant , with complicated density , temperature and velocity distributions ( tenorio - tagle et al . 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "severe distortion of the wds by cooling and rayleigh - taylor instabilities is also revealed in 2-d simulations ( tenorio - tagle et al . 1991 ) . in this picture , the inner shell of kes 79 is interpreted as an overtaken wds , evaporating in the interior of the remnant .",
    "the opening of the inner shell at the north may indicate a blow - out of the wind , or could be due to the motion of the progenitor towards the south .",
    "the outer shell is the blast wave running in the undisturbed medium .",
    "the blast wave should have been decelerated when crossing the wds",
    ". the middle shell could be the projected outer shell in another direction where the blastwave has crossed a locally denser medium .",
    "a local reflection shock is another possibility .    in summary , both scenarios",
    "can roughly explain the observed properties .",
    "we prefer the latter since it is a natural consequence of massive star evolution .",
    "projection is still needed to explain the complicated morphology .    however",
    ", neither scenario explains the ionization timescales of the inner shell and the outer shell derived from the nei fitting .",
    "the outer shell and inner shell seem to have similar ionization timescales , implying that the denser inner shell is more recently shocked than the outer shell .",
    "both models require the outer shell to be shocked at a later or comparable time than the inner shell .",
    "the current spectral measurement of the faint outer shell still , however , has large uncertainties .",
    "future observations may resolve this puzzle .",
    "at least 7 bright or faint clumpy filaments are found in this observation ( fig .",
    "1 ) . they have a width of 6 - 9 arcsec ( 0.2 - 0.3 pc ) , compared to their length of 2 - 3 arcmin ( 3.1 - 6.2 pc ) .",
    "we measured the surface brightness of the two eastern bright filaments and their surroundings .",
    "the filaments are brighter by a factor of 12 - 15 , implying an average density difference of @xmath0 4 .",
    "this difference is just as predicted for adiabatic shocks .",
    "thus , these two filaments are probably thin shells viewed edge - on .",
    "they may also be part of the shocked wds .",
    "there are several filaments in the interior , however , for which this interpretation is less possible .",
    "filament - like structures are also predicted by numerical simulations of shock - cloud interactions ( e.g. , xu & stone 1995 ) , but in simulations , the cloud is fragmented and filament - like structures are very complicated and chaotic .",
    "the filaments in the ne sector of kes 79 seem to be very ordered .",
    "this observation provides a challenge to model the interior structure in middle - aged snrs .",
    "accurate estimate of age depends on the understanding of the dynamical evolution of the remnant .",
    "the simple sedov solution and the cloudlet evaporation scenario proposed by white & long ( 1991 ) can not fit the observed properties . in @xmath75.2 , we suggest that the bright inner shell may be the overrun wds , which complicates the dynamical history of the remnant . as pointed out and discussed by weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , the wds can be considered as a thin shell after the cooling in the wds is important .",
    "chen et al . ( 2003 ) derived a semi - analytic solution for snrs which evolve crossing a density jump in the surrounding medium , also assuming a thin shell . for kes 79 ,",
    "since the radius of inner shell is small ( @xmath0 6 pc ) , the remnant should be in the free expansion stage before the blastwave hits the wds .",
    "after the hit , the remnant is in the sedov phase .",
    "thus , we can apply the solution of chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to kes 79 . using a blastwave temperature ( t@xmath27 ) of 0.6 kev , a density ratio @xmath28 of 0.1 ( see the definition in chen et al .",
    "2003 ) , radii of 3@xmath1 ( 6.2 pc ) and 6@xmath1 ( 12.4 pc ) for the inner and outer shells respectively , the time after the blastwave hits the wds is 5.2 ( t@xmath27/0.6 kev)@xmath9 kyr , from equ . 7 , 8 , 10 and 11 in chen et al .",
    "this result is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath28 .",
    "if the velocity of the blastwave is 5000 - 10000 km s@xmath5 inside the wds , the age of the remnant is 5.8 - 6.4 kyr .",
    "for t@xmath27 in the range of 0.4 - 0.7 kev , the age is 5.4 - 7.5 kyr .",
    "not surprisingly , the derived age is close to the one derived from the sedov solution ( 5.9 - 7.8 kyr for a shock temperature of 0.4 - 0.7 kev ; sedov 1959 )",
    ". a lower limit on the age of the remnant can also be derived from the measured ionization timescale .",
    "the ionization timescales derived for individual small regions have large uncertainties , but are all around 10@xmath18 @xmath12 s. using an average electron density of 0.5 - 1 @xmath12 , we set a lower limit on the age of remnant : 3.2 - 6.4 kyr , which is consistent with the estimate from dynamics .    the ambient density ( n@xmath29 )",
    "can also be estimated from the work of chen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , n@xmath29 = 0.36 e@xmath30 ( t@xmath27/0.6 kev)@xmath5 @xmath12 for the assumed shock radius and wds radius , where e@xmath30 is the explosion energy in the unit of 10@xmath31 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this may be only the average value , since the large brightness contrast between the inner shell and outer shell may imply a radial ambient density gradient .",
    "if we assume a spherical and uniform distribution of the ambient medium , this density corresponds to a swept - up ism mass of 99 e@xmath30 ( t@xmath27/0.6 kev)@xmath5 m@xmath32 .",
    "we also can estimate the average electron density and mass of the x - ray emitting gas from the best - fit emission measure .",
    "since the regions within the inner 3@xmath1 radius and at 3@xmath1 - 6@xmath1 have large surface brightness contrast , the gas properties are derived separately in the two regions .",
    "the different emission measure derived from two nei codes ( table 2 ) adds some uncertainty here .",
    "the projection from the outer bin to the inner bin is estimated by assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the results are : for the inner 3@xmath1 , @xmath33 = 0.8 - 1.2 f@xmath34 @xmath12 and m@xmath35 = 28 - 40 f@xmath36 m@xmath32 , for the region between 3@xmath1 and 6@xmath1 , @xmath33 = 0.25 - 0.35 f@xmath37 @xmath12 and m@xmath35 = 44 - 62 f@xmath38 m@xmath32 , where f@xmath39 and f@xmath40 are the filling factors of the hot gas in the inner and outer bins respectively .",
    "the inner bin ( dominant by bright shells and filaments ) and the outer bin ( mostly faint diffuse emission ) should have different filling factors .",
    "but in any cases , it is clear that all the x - ray emitting gas can be the swept - up ism .",
    "the  observation of snr kes 79 has led to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the  image of kes 79 reveals rich spatial structures : filaments , multiple shells , a loop and a `` protrusion '' , implying a complicated environment around kes 79 .",
    "most of the x - ray structures have corresponding radio structures , implying the importance of shock compression .",
    "three shells are detected in the sw part of the remnant .",
    "the inner shell may be an evaporating wds overrun by the blast wave ( the outer shell ) .",
    "the middle shell is perhaps due to projection or a reflection shock .",
    "the age of the remnant is estimated to be @xmath0 6 kyr from the assumed dynamics .",
    "we do not find regions with significantly enriched heavy elements , including the bright inner shell .",
    "this implies that the ejecta have been mixed well with the surrounding medium given the relative youth of the remnant .",
    "regardless of the systematic discrepancy of results from the two codes , there is little temperature variation across the remnant , no matter the geometry and location . if thermal conduction is responsible for smoothing the temperature gradient , a lower limit of @xmath0 1/10 spitzer value on the thermal conductivity can be obtained .",
    "thus , thermal conduction may have a significant effect in the evolution of snrs .",
