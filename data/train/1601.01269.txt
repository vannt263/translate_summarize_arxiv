    "pristine graphene is a gapless dirac material , while the energy gap is needed for the fabrication of switching devices .",
    "there are a few causes , such as staggered substrate influence@xcite and the spin - orbit coupling,@xcite to open a gap on the spectrum of graphene .",
    "the latter is more attractive because it makes graphene a topologic insulator and leads to helical edge bands which is topologically protected by the time - reversal symmetry.@xcite however , the spin - orbit coupling in graphene is proven to be too weak to detect.@xcite recent researches implied that the time dependent driving may have the similar effects as the spin - orbit coupling in graphene : it generates gaps and turn a normal material into a special topologic insulator called floquet topologic insulator.@xcite besides in condensed matters , the interest of the novel effects of driving is increasing in cold atoms@xcite and other fields .",
    "recently , the floquet topologic phase was realized in a photonic crystal,@xcite which indicated the validity of the theoretical prediction .",
    "light irradiation is an important periodically driving source , and the irradiation induced energy gaps in a topological insulator was observed recently.@xcite these experiments provide the probability to generate gaps and change the topologic property of graphene by light irradiation.@xcite    light irradiation generates energy gaps in graphene by two mechanisms .",
    "first , under the affection of light , the electron near the dirac point emits a photon and re - absorbs it to renormalize the band structure , and a gap is generated at the dirac point to separate the conduction and valence bands,@xcite which is the effect of second order perturbation .",
    "second , light induces resonant transition between conduction band and valence band states , and produces dynamic gaps on the quasi - energy spectrum at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angular frequency of light.@xcite the latter is more attractive because it is a first order process .    typically , periodically driven system is treated in frequency space,@xcite also called floquet space .",
    "the whole space is divided into infinite subspaces according to the number of photons absorbed and emitted .",
    "the system is solved by truncating the floquet space at a finite dimension . for the weak driven cases ,",
    "the main physics is determined by the one - photon processes that can be well understood .",
    "it is possible to develop a short theory to handle the driven system by only taking the one - photon processes into account .",
    "the theory should simplify the calculation , reproduce the results of other more complicated methods , and more importantly , give more insight on the physics of driven systems .    in this paper , we proposed a minimal model to describe the floquet band structure of two - dimensional materials with light - induced resonant inter - band transition and applied the theory to graphene .",
