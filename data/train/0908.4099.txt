    "the properties of qcd at finite temperature and density find applications in topics as diverse as the nature of proto - neutron stars , early universe cosmology , and experiment at rhic and the lhc@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many of the properties of interest are nonperturbative , and , with the exception of lattice techniques , tools for dealing with nonperturbative field theory remain rudimentary .",
    "heightening our discomfort is the continuing statistical ` minus sign ' problem in lattice field theory that is present at finite chemical potential@xcite .",
    "furthermore , well - known problems of infrared ( ir ) divergences at high order in perturbation theory persist@xcite . even old hopes that qcd at large temperature is perturbative may be misplaced since large temperature qcd corresponds to the dimensionally reduced qcd of three dimensions , which is also confining .",
    "thus it is of interest to develop nonperturbative methods for analysing qcd and model systems in medium .",
    "here we examine the properties of two simple models of confinement that are motivated by qcd in coulomb gauge .",
    "the analysis of such models dates from the mid-1980s and parallels extensive work with nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) models@xcite .",
    "( we note that njl models are not renormalisable and do not exhibit confinement . ) in the following we will examine a contact model in detail , focussing on coupling constant dependence of the phase diagram , possible critical points , and the effects of incorporating polarisation in the formalism .",
    "we demonstrate that a surprisingly rich structure emerges .",
    "we also examine confining potential models with the intent of clarifying several points in the literature .",
    "the first of these concerns the existence of infrared divergences in the temperature - dependent gap equations that naively renders them useless .",
    "the second issue is whether a linear model can support a chiral phase transition .",
    "we resolve these issues and also examine the effects of polarisation on the phase diagram .",
    "as far as we are aware this investigation presents the first determination of the phase structure of confining models and the first examination of general vacuum polarisation effects in contact and confining models .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian of qcd in coulomb gauge .",
    "coulomb gauge is especially appropriate for the study of in - medium properties of qcd because all its degrees of freedom are physical .",
    "the usual demerit associated with non - manifest covariance is obviated by the presence of the heat bath . upon neglecting transverse gluons",
    ", the qcd hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the colour quark current and @xmath2 is a generator of @xmath3 .",
    "neglecting transverse gluons ruins the gauge and lorentz invariance properties to the theory .",
    "however , it has been argued that ( dynamically ) massive transverse gluons provide a more accurate basis for the exploration of low energy properties of qcd@xcite .",
    "thus , as long as the induced error is not too great , gauge invariance should be approximately respected .",
    "similarly , the full theory is lorentz invariant , even if it is not manifestly covariant .",
    "accurate truncations should accurately preserve this property .",
    "the instantaneous interaction kernel corresponds to the coulomb potential in qed ; in the case of qcd it can be written as the vacuum expectation value of the coulomb operator@xcite    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the adjoint covariant derivative , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are colour indices , and @xmath8 is the full vacuum .",
    "this interaction is often modelled as a linear confinement potential :    @xmath9    the string tension is denoted @xmath7 and its phenomenological value is approximately @xmath10 gev@xmath11 .",
    "an alternative that matches to perturbation theory is provided by the richardson potential , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number of quark flavours .    finally , we shall consider a simple contact model defined by    @xmath16    the scale @xmath17 is introduced to set dimensions and will be used as an ultraviolet cutoff in this model .",
    "of course the contact model is not confining , however it permits detailed analysis of in - medium effects since the resulting equations are considerably simplified .",
    "it also serves as a reference point for the confining models .",
    "the partition function is defined as    @xmath18 = \\int d\\bar \\psi d\\psi \\ , { \\rm exp}[- a + \\bar \\eta \\psi + \\bar \\psi \\eta]\\ ] ]    with @xmath19 notice that a quark chemical potential term , proportional to @xmath20 , has been added to the action .",
    "we employ the imaginary time formalism for evaluating the partition function .",
    "in particular , the time integral reduces to sums over bosonic and fermionic matsubara frequencies .",
    "these sums are evaluated by integrating over appropriate contours using the orsay representation of the propagators .",
    "our goal is to study the in - medium properties of chiral symmetry breaking in the models defined in section [ models ] .",
    "thus nonperturbative methods are required and we employ the schwinger - dyson equations as our organising principle .    the schwinger - dyson equation for the full fermion propagator in potential models such as those employed here is shown in fig .",
    "the dashed line in this figure represents an application of the instantaneous interaction .",
    "notice that this line is not dressed and does not have an analogous schwinger - dyson equation because it is not dynamical . inserting the tree level approximation to the fermion four - point vertex of fig .",
    "[ sde1 ] yields the equation represented in fig .",
    "this equation represents a series of diagrams that yield the rainbow - ladder approximation to the fermion propagator , corrections to the rainbow - ladder approximation generated by a dressed vacuum polarisation insertion , and corrections due to vertex dressing .",
    "if one neglects vertex correction diagrams , it is possible to sum all dressed vacuum polarisation insertions by rewriting the equation represented in fig .",
    "[ sde2 ] as shown in fig .",
    "these coupled equations , called the gap equations , form the starting point for our investigation of dynamical mass generation .",
    "it is important that the vacuum polarisation fermion loop of the second equation utilises dressed fermion propagators .",
    "failure to do so would yield a branch cut that signifies the decay of dressed fermions to bare fermions  which is clearly physically unreasonable .",
    "the second gap equation ( fig . [ sde3 ] ) implements the `` ring approximation '' to the full interaction potential .",
    "this approximation was first employed by brueckner and gell - mann@xcite to solve the infrared divergence problem in the electron self energy of the degenerate electron gas . as we shall discuss",
    "shortly , it will serve the same purpose here .",
    "we define the polarisation as    @xmath21 \\label{pidef}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the number of quarks ( considered of equal mass in the following ) , @xmath22 is the full quark propagator ( discussed more fully below ) , and @xmath23 is a four vector defined as    @xmath24    the fermionic matsubara frequency is given by @xmath25 , and @xmath20 is the quark chemical potential .",
    "the colour trace yields the factor of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "[ pidef ] . the expression for the polarisation",
    "is usually split into vacuum and matter components , with the vacuum contribution being defined as @xmath27 .",
    "renormalisation follows the standard vacuum formalism and hence only affects @xmath28 .    with this definition",
    "the ring potential is given by    @xmath29    to establish contact with well - known results we note that    @xmath30    in the case of a massless bare quark .",
    "of course the full computation must be made with dressed quark propagators and hence forms part of the coupled gap equations .",
    "incorporating polarisation effects in the gap equations can be very important .",
    "for example , quantum electrodynamics in three dimensions is a ( logarithmically ) confining theory ; however , including polarisation effects due to massless fermions _ completely screens _ the confinement potential , leaving a coulombic heavy fermion interaction@xcite . similarly , increasing the number of quarks in qcd eventually drives the theory into a conformal window with no confinement@xcite .",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ sde3 ] represent four coupled integral equations ; three involve the scalar functions defined in the general expression for the in - medium inverse quark propagator :    @xmath31    the scalars @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 depends on @xmath35 and @xmath38 , substantially complicating the solution to the gap equations .",
    "however , the dominant infrared contribution to the ring potential is obtained in the static limit , @xmath39 and we employ this limit in the following . under these conditions",

    "koci presents analytic results for a contact model very similar to ours , but without consideration of vacuum polarisation effects .",
    "all three papers consider the linear confinement model at zero temperature ; ref .",
    "@xcite incorporates ring corrections and examines the effect on charmonium dissociation , but neglects the vacuum part of the polarisation without comment .",
    "a contact model is considered at finite temperature and density in ref .",
    "@xcite ; additional related studies are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of the contact potential or the ring contact potential in the static and long wavelength limits ( discussed below ) these equations",

    "[ vringapprox ] illustrates , in the linear case @xmath49 dominates @xmath37 for @xmath50 and it is reasonable to use the zero momentum limit of the polarisation function in the gap equations . we shall confirm this in the following . in this limit",
    "the vacuum contribution to the polarisation function vanishes and we need only consider the matter contribution .",
    "in fact no ultraviolet divergences remain in the linear model and we do not consider renormalisation .",
    "of course the contact model must be cutoff at the scale @xmath17 , as previously indicated .    in the contact case",
    ", this approximation implies that @xmath37 is a constant and hence @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "thus the integral equation for @xmath34 in the contact case becomes a relatively simple algebraic equation , greatly simplifying the problem .    in the low momentum limit",
    "the explicit expression for @xmath51 becomes    ( 0,q 0 ) = -4 n_f [ 2+e^e(k ) + e^-e(k)]^-1 where @xmath52 depends on @xmath33 and @xmath34 and is naively infrared divergent ( cf",
    "[ gapeqs ] and section [ sectd ] ) .",

    "it is important , however , to note that @xmath55 still depends on the full single particle energy , @xmath56 .      in the absence of polarisation effects the linear model gap equations of eq .",
    "[ gapeqs ] are naively infrared divergent . specifically as @xmath57 on the right hand side , the potential diverges as @xmath58 .",
    "thus the quark energy @xmath56 is divergent , the thermodynamic function approaches unity , and temperature effects disappear from the in - medium gap equations .",
    "we stress that it is not possible to write the equations in terms of ir - finite quantities , in contrast to the zero temperature case .",
    "this nonsensical result was first noted by davis and matheson@xcite who suggested that one should make the _ ad hoc _ replacement    e(q ) e(q ) - e(0 ) in the expression for @xmath59 .",
    "this removes the infrared divergence and yields a sensible in - medium gap equation .",
    "an alternative suggestion was made by alkofer _",
    "et al._@xcite , who simply replaced @xmath56 with @xmath60 .",
    "the utility of this ansatz is that the equation for @xmath61 is infrared finite as evidenced in eq .",
    "we shall denote this procedure as ` aal ' in the following .",
    "finally , the orsay group has argued that infinite quark energies are physically reasonable and reflect the absence of individual quarks in the physical spectrum@xcite .",
    "they therefore reformulate the thermodynamic trace to sum over colour singlet states only .",
    "this greatly complicates the thermodynamic trace but eventually yields a simple result : momentum space integrals such as appearing in eqs .",
    "[ gapeqs ] are restricted to @xmath62 , thereby eliminating the infrared divergence .",
    "none of these resolutions seem appropriate .",
    "the substitutions of refs . @xcite and @xcite are completely _ ad hoc_. however , it is possible that they are reasonable approximations , and we investigate this in the next section .",
    "the orsay approach is physically motivated , however , it should not be necessary to explicitly remove nonsinglet degrees of freedom from the thermodynamic trace because they are automatically removed by the boltzmann factor .",
    "we note the following : ( i ) infrared divergences are normally removed by considering additional physical effects ( such as bremsstrahlung ) or by summing additional classes of diagrams ( as with the resolution of the ir divergence problem in the degenerate electron gas@xcite or in the hard thermal loop ( htl ) partial resolution of gauge - variance and other problems in thermal qcd@xcite ) ( ii ) ` artificial ' infrared divergences sometimes appear in problems involving confinement potentials@xcite .",
    "we examine both issues in the following . specifically , issue ( i )",
    "has been addressed by summing the ring diagrams in the gap equations .",
    "this has the effect of removing the infrared divergence in all expressions , as evident in eq .",
    "[ vringapprox ] .",
    "surprisingly , issue ( ii ) is also relevant here .",
    "indeed , the gap equations are trivially ir regulated by subtracting zero .",
    "for example , the third of eqs .",
    "[ gapeqs ] can be rewritten as    b_p = m + v_ring(p - q ) .",
    "[ bregeq ] while this yields a formally ir - finite equation , we find that it is still strongly dependent on the infrared regime , thus it remains useful to employ the ring potential in the formalism when performing numerical computations .",
    "we examine the regulated gap equations with the bare and ring potentials in the following section .",
    "our results will be presented as plots of the dynamical mass at zero momentum as a function of chemical potential and temperature .",
    "thus we determine the phase structure of the contact and confinement models .",
    "as far as we know these are the first computations of these phase diagrams for confining potentials .",
    "the results for all potentials with ring corrections are also new .    the coupled gap equations are solved with a variety of techniques .",
    "our typical approach is to compute on a momentum grid .",
    "unknown functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath37 are determined by minimizing an appropriate functional that represents the gap equations using a modified levenburg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "alternatively , we attempt iterative solutions ( which are often not stable ) and combinations of iteration and minimisation .",
    "we also employ a variety of analytic approximations to quantities such as @xmath61 and @xmath37 and confirm the more complete results .",
    "for example , computing the full momentum dependence of @xmath51 is time - consuming and it is useful to expand it as a taylor series in momentum .",
    "the results presented here represent several months of single core computer time .",
    "the contact model is defined in terms of the coupling @xmath63 and ultraviolet cutoff @xmath17 .",
    "it is ir - finite and hence the only issues here are the effect of the ring interaction and , of course , the new phase structure shown below .",
    "contact models such as ours have a critical coupling @xmath64 , below which no chiral symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "since this is a zero - temperature property of the model and @xmath65 vanishes in this limit , the critical coupling is the same for the bare and ring models :    _ c = 6 ^2 .    to set conventions we choose to work in the broken phase , setting @xmath66 and then fixing the scale @xmath67 mev to yield reasonable approximations for the dynamical quark mass and chiral restoration temperature , @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 mev .",
    "the chiral condensate is given by the expression     approximately a factor of two too small ( in linear dimension ) .",
    "finally the critical chemical potential is approximately @xmath70 mev .",
    "the numerical values of these observables shift slightly with the coupling , for example for @xmath71 one finds @xmath72 mev , @xmath73 mev , and @xmath74 mev .",
    "it is the fact that the zero temperature gap equation has a critical coupling that drives the finite temperature and density phase transitions .",
    "specifically , the presence of the thermodynamic function @xmath55 at @xmath75 can be modelled as an effective coupling :    ( t , ) = ( q;t , )    where the angle brackets denote some average over the integrand of the gap equation .",
    "once @xmath76 drops below @xmath64 the model makes the transition to the symmetric phase .    the phase diagram for the bare contact model is shown in fig .",
    "[ m - t - mu - contact-1.5 ] . in the following",
    "we will refer to @xmath77 defined as @xmath78 .",
    "this represents a ` constituent quark mass ' and is a useful and simple proxy for the chiral condensate .",
    "we note that the simplicity of the contact gap equations permit a detailed analysis of the phase structure , including a precise determination of the order of the phase transition .",
    "this is useful since , as the figure illustrates , the phase structure is quite complex .",
    "we find that the chiral symmetry restoration phase transition is second order for all chemical potentials below a critical density    _ ( = 1.5_c ) 0.53 . for higher chemical potential",
    "the transition is first order .",
    "furthermore , a second solution to the gap equations develops ",
    "these are the lower lines seen in the figure between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "these solutions indicate the presence of a first order phase transition ; however , they are unphysical in that they have higher free energy , as demonstrated by their lack of continuity with the low-@xmath20 solutions .    including the zero - momentum vacuum polarisation function ( with @xmath81 ) in the gap equations induces nontrivial dynamical mass , temperature , and chemical potential dependence in the kernel of the gap equation .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ m - t - mu - contact - ring ] .",
    "it is apparent that the additional mass dependence causes the bifurcated solution to exist for all chemical potential .",
    "the phase transition is first order for all values of temperature and chemical potential .",
    "furthermore , the numerical value of the critical temperature is strongly affected :    t_c(=0 ; = 1.5_c ; bare ) = 0.38 drops to    t_c(= 0 ; = 1.5 _ c ; ring ) = 0.17 .",
    "for @xmath71 the analogous results are @xmath82 and @xmath83 . of course , @xmath84 does not change because it is defined at @xmath85 and @xmath86 at this point .",
    "thus the shape of the critical region and the phase transition are strongly affected by moving beyond the bare interaction approximation in the gap equation .",
    "finally , we consider the case where the full momentum dependence is retained in the vacuum polarisation , leading to a momentum dependent ring potential .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ m - t - mu - contact - ring - full ] .",
    "we see that the dynamical fermion mass has dropped to @xmath87 , as have the critical temperature and chemical potential @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "however , upon rescaling @xmath17 we find that all of these quantities remain essentially unchanged .",
    "furthermore , it appears that the phase transition is first order throughout the phase diagram , as it is in the zero - momentum ring case ( determining the order of the phase transition is difficult with momentum dependent interactions because algebraic methods are not applicable ) .",
    "thus it appears that including the full momentum dependence of the polarisation function and ring potential alters the numerical values of quantities in units of the cutoff , but leaves physical quantities approximately invariant .",
    "we have also studied the @xmath63-dependence of the phase diagram for the ` bare ' contact model .",
    "we find that all quantities scale roughly linearly with @xmath63 .",
    "for example , to a good approximation    m_0 ( ) = 0.011 ( 1 - e^-0.028(-_c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the relative strengths of the dimensional quantities seem to be roughly independent of the coupling , and we find :    _ c ( ) m_0 ( ) 2 t_c ( ) 2 _ ( )    the coupling dependence of the phase diagram for the bare interaction case is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram - contact ] .",
    "the approximate linear scaling is evident .",
    "this is also true for the critical point @xmath79 down to @xmath90 .",
    "below this point the first order phase transition disappears and the entire diagram represents a second order phase transition .",
    "the confinement models exhibit the full ir singularities that have driven the discussion .",
    "unfortunately , the models are much more difficult to analyse and one must rely on accurate numerics to establish the order of phase transitions .",
    "the relation of the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions is also of interest .",
    "longstanding lattice gauge theory results indicate that these transition temperatures coincide@xcite .",
    "since the confinement potential is fixed bare models can not reproduce this behaviour .",
    "indeed davis and matheson have argued@xcite that all confining potentials break chiral symmetry and since the only in - medium effect is the addition of the factor @xmath55 in the gap equation kernels , it is feasible that there can be _ no _ transition to the chirally symmetric phase",

    "[ m - t - mu - v - aal ] we confirm the existence of a phase transition in the confinement model with the aal prescription ( and we extend their results to the @xmath91 plane ) .",
    "we speculate that the argument of davis and matheson has failed because for high temperature and low momentum the thermodynamic function is approximately @xmath92 , and hence the effective confining potential is replaced by @xmath93 , which is not confining .",
    "perhaps this is sufficient to drive the observed behaviour .",
    "numerical values for the linear potential are @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 mev , @xmath96 mev , and the condensate is determined to be @xmath97 mev .",
    "note that we interpret the dynamical mass as a constituent quark mass .",

    "the surfaces at @xmath101 look very similar , however the critical temperature has dropped from 38 mev to 10 mev .",
    "the critical chemical potential remains fixed at @xmath95 mev .",
    "thus the shape of the phase diagram has been severely distorted by incorporating vacuum polarisation in the model .",
    "furthermore , as with the contact model , it appears that all phase transitions are now first order , and the tricritical point no longer exists .",
    "thus , as anticipated , including dynamical quarks in the model can have a dramatic effect on thermodynamic properties .",
    "the vacuum polarisation function introduces explicit temperature and density dependence to the quark interaction , which raises the possibility of explicit quark deconfinement in the model .",
    "it is possible that this dependence causes the potential to deconfine at a critical temperature .",
    "however , it is more likely that the potential deconfines for all nonzero temperature .",
    "indeed , in perturbation theory one can approximate the ring potential as    v_ring(q , t,=0 ) .",
    "the fourier transform of this potential is linear when @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath75 the potential is linear at small distances , has a transition region at @xmath102 , and approaches zero at large distances , so that deconfinement is natural , although not sudden .",
    "a careful analysis of deconfinement awaits a study of qcd .    finally , we consider incorporating the full momentum dependence of the polarisation function in the gap equations .",
    "it is important to note that the vacuum contribution to the polarisation function is not zero for non - zero momentum .",
    "this contribution must be renormalised at the expense of introducing another parameter to the model . in practice ,",
    "the relatively good agreement with heavy quark spectroscopy would be ruined by this procedure .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath28 to already be incorporated in the model interaction , and simply consider matter contributions to the ring potential .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical solution of the gap equations is substantially complicated in this case .",
    "solving the full set of coupled integral equations can be time consuming and unstable .",
    "we have found that setting @xmath103 to be large provides a very good approximation to the full gap equations , and this approximation has been employed for most of the linear ring results presented here .",
    "an additional complication is provided by the requirement to compute the polarisation at many grid points at each step of the computation .",
    "however , we have found that expanding @xmath104 to @xmath105 is very accurate , and this speeds the solution tremendously .    in the end , the results are very similar to those of the zero momentum case , as anticipated above . for example , the dynamical mass @xmath106 is lowered by approximately 1 mev when incorporating the momentum dependence of the vacuum polarisation .",

    "in particular , the richardson potential incorporates a running coulomb interaction , and it has been speculated that this can enhance the chiral condensate .",
    "we find , however , that the richardson potential yields nearly identical results as the linear potential .",
    "for example , the aal richardson dynamical mass is only 1 mev less than the corresponding linear mass .",
    "similarly , the critical temperature drops 0.7 mev and the critical density raises 3.2 mev .",

    "the phase transition becomes first order .",
    "the appearance of _ any _ phase transition is somewhat surprising , since it is in conflict with the reasonable expectations of davis and matheson .",
    "the numerical values for the dynamical mass , chiral restoration temperature and density , and chiral condensate are all in agreement with qcd expectations if the string tension is increased to a value of 1.8 gev@xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , this is in severe conflict with well - established quark model phenomenology and lattice gauge results that require a string tension of approximately 0.2 gev@xmath11 .",
    "it is thus apparent that the simplest confinement models can not both reproduce thermodynamic and spectroscopic quantities with any reliability .",
    "of course this conclusion depends on the approximations we have made .",
    "however , the large discrepancy seems difficult to overcome and we expect that simple confinement models are incapable of describing in - medium properties of qcd .",
    "these conclusions hold for both linear and richardson models .",
    "we have noted that two resolutions to the confinement model infrared problem exist : a direct physical resolution is to employ the ring approximation and a simple mathematical resolution involves the proper regularisation of the fourier transform of the linear potential .",
    "we find sufficient numerical infrared instability to warrant employing the physically reasonable , and presumably more accurate , ring schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "results in the static / low momentum and static / finite momentum limits were found to coincide very well . as with the contact interaction ,",
    "ring diagrams induce strong effects in thermodynamic observables , causing the critical temperature to drop by a factor of four and changing all phase transitions to first order .",
    "pisarski and mclerran have recently used the large @xmath110 limit to argue that a ` quarkyonic ' qcd phase may exist@xcite .",
    "this phase is proposed to exist at high chemical potential and low temperature and to be characterised by chirally symmetric but confined quark matter .",
    "( we note that the argument is supported by observations that chiral symmetry breaking should be irrelevant high in the zero temperature hadron spectrum@xcite . )",
    "the large @xmath110 limit suppresses quark loop effects , thereby yielding an interaction that is independent of the chemical potential .",
    "thus the linear no - ring model presented here can be considered an implementation of the large @xmath110 scenario .",
    "our results then confirm the idea that a confining but chirally symmetric phase can exist .",
    "of course , decreasing the number of colours implies an increasing importance of vacuum polarisation with commensurate changes in phenomenology , as noted above . a full assessment of the quarkyonic matter scenario must await a nonperturbative investigation of more realistic models of qcd .",
    "the application of finite temperature and density schwinger - dyson methods to the qcd hamiltonian will be of great interest . as illustrated here",
    ", one of the overriding considerations will be the construction of a robust truncation scheme for hamiltonians with infrared enhanced interactions .",
    "indeed , the ward identities relate vertices and propagators , so one expects that if corrections to propagators are necessary , one should truncate full vertices very carefully .",
    "of course this observation is borne out by the experience with the effective field theory generating the htl limit of qcd .",
