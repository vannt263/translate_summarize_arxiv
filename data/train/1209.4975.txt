    "rough set theory is based on equivalence relations , and it was proposed by pawlak to handle incomplete and inexact knowledge in information systems .",

    ", matroids have been used in diverse fields , such as combinatorial optimization  @xcite , algorithm design  @xcite , information coding  @xcite and cryptology  @xcite .    in this paper , for a universe and an equivalence relation on the universe , we define a parametric set family , with any subset of the universe as its parameter , is defined to connect rough sets and matroids .",
    "firstly , for any subset , the parametric set family is proved to satisfy the independent set axiom of matroids , then a matroid called a parametric matroid of the rough set with respect to the subset is generated by the parametric set family .",
    "two equivalent representations of the parametric set family are obtained through the lower approximation operator , and another equivalent representation is expressed by the partition generated by the equivalence relation . moreover , the parametric matroid of the rough set with respect to the subset is proved to be the direct sum of a partition - circuit matroid and a free matroid , where the partition - circuit matroid is based on the restriction of the equivalence relation in the complement of the lower approximation of the subset and the free matroid is based on the lower approximation of the subset .",
    "the partition - circuit matroid is the restriction of the parametric matroid of the rough set , and so is the free matroid .",
    "secondly , several characteristics of the parametric matroid of the rough set are studied by the lower approximation number which is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "since a partition - circuit matroid was well investigated through the lower approximation number in  @xcite , we use it to study the parametric matroid of the rough set as the direct sum of a partition - circuit matroid and a free matroid .",
    "independent sets , bases , circuits , the rank function and the closure operator of the parametric matroid of the rough set are well expressed by the lower approximation number .",
