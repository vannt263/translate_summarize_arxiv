    "<S> although cokriging in theory should yield smaller or equal prediction variance than kriging , this outperformance sometimes is hard to see in practice . </S>",
    "<S> this should motivate theoretical studies on cokriging . </S>",
    "<S> in general , there is a lack of theoretical results for cokriging . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we provide some theoretical results to compare cokriging with kriging by examining some explicit models and specific sampling schemes .    </S>",
    "<S> ./style / arxiv - general.cfg    @xcite provided an excellent review of recent development in the mutivariate covariance functions . in many situations , </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate objective of modeling the multivariate covariance function is to obtain superior prediction through cokriging . in theory </S>",
    "<S> , cokriging should have a prediction variance no larger than that of the kriging prediction . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the authors point out in the paper , sometimes the improvement of cokriging is very little or none . in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we try to shed some light through some theoretical investigations .    for univariate gaussian stationary processes </S>",
    "<S> , we now have a good understanding of the properties of kriging and statistical inferences . </S>",
    "<S> for example , theoretical results have been established to justify ( i ) that two different covariance functions may yield asymptotically equally optimal prediction @xcite , and ( ii ) some parameters are not consistently estimable if the spatial domain is bounded @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we know the conditions under which a misspecified covariance function yields an asymptotically right prediction and can exploit this fact to simplify computations ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we lack the analogous understanding for the multivariate spatial models . </S>",
    "<S> there are no explicit theoretical results to answer the following questions :    * how important is the cross - covariance function ? </S>",
    "<S> specifically , could two different multivariate covariance functions yield an asymptotically equally optimal prediction ? * which parameters are important to cokriging ? we know </S>",
    "<S> which parameters are important to kriging . * </S>",
    "<S> how much improvement does cokriging have over kriging ?    </S>",
    "<S> one particular concept that has been shown useful in the study of kriging is the equivalence of probability measures due to a theorem established by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be sampling sites on a fixed domain ( area ) where the process @xmath2 is observed , and @xmath3 be a set of sites on the same domain where @xmath4 is to be predicted . if the two gaussian measures @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equivalent on the @xmath7-algebra generated by @xmath8 then with @xmath5-probability one , @xmath9 where the supremum is taken over @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the above result implies that the linear predictions under the two measures are asymptotically equally optimal @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this result can be readily extended to the multivariate spatial process and therefore implies two cokriging predictors are asymptotically equally optimal under the two probability measures if the two gaussian measures are equivalent . however , unlike in the univaritate case , there are very limited results on equivalence of probability measures . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gave some general conditions for equivalent measures for multivariate gaussian processes though there is still a lack of explicit examples where equivalent measures occur .    </S>",
    "<S> we now provide some sufficient conditions for the equivalent of gaussian measures for a particular bivariate model . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath11 be a stationary bivariate gaussian process with the following bivariate covariance function under the probability measure @xmath12 , @xmath13 , such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the matrn covariance function with variance @xmath16 , scale parameter @xmath17 and the smoothness parameter @xmath18 . </S>",

    "<S> love expansion under measure @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> the two measures are equivalent on the hilbert space if and only if they are so on @xmath37 ( @xcite , @xcite , page  72 ) . to show the equivalence of the two measures , we only need to verify ( @xcite , @xcite , page  129 ) @xmath38\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\quad < \\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because conditions ( [ eqnequiv ] ) imply that the two measures are equivalent on @xmath39 @xcite , we must have @xmath40 for @xmath41 , equations ( [ eqn2 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 ] ) imply @xmath42 therefore , ( [ eqnproof ] ) is proved and so is the sufficiency of the conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we now have an explicit example where two different bivariate covariance functions yield asymptotically equal cokriging results .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we will try to explain why sometimes it is hard to see the improvement of cokriging over the kriging prediction . consider a bivariate gaussian process with mean 0 and exponential covariance functions such that @xmath43\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & = & \\sigma_{ij}\\exp\\bigl(-\\alpha{\\vert}\\hh{\\vert}\\bigr),\\quad i , j=1,2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assume the two processes are observed at @xmath44 points @xmath45 , and predict @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> write @xmath47 , @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that in this case the cokriging predictor is identical to the kriging predictor . to see this , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath49 denote the correlation matrix of @xmath50 , which is also the correlation matrix of @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath52 let @xmath53 be the matrix with @xmath54th element @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> . then the covariance matrix of @xmath56 is @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath58 denote the vector of correlation coefficients between @xmath59 , the variable to be predicted , and @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath60\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\quad = \\bigl((\\sigma_{11 } , \\sigma_{22})\\otimes\\kk ' \\bigr ) \\bigl(v^{-1}\\otimes r^{-1 } \\bigr)\\yy \\\\ & & \\quad = \\bigl ( \\bigl(\\kk ' , 0 \\bigr)\\otimes r^{-1 } \\bigr ) \\yy=\\kk ' r^{-1}\\yy_1 \\nonumber\\\\[-8pt ] \\label{eqn6}\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\quad = e \\bigl(y_1(\\ss)| \\yy_1 \\bigr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , cokriging is identical to kriging and we should not expect any improvement of cokriging over kriging . </S>",
    "<S> we can also show that they are identical if @xmath61 is observed at a subset of locations where @xmath62 is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> one scenario where cokriging might outperform kriging is when the auxiliary variable is observed at more locations than the predicted variable . in the next example </S>",
    "<S> , we will examine analytically what variables affect the improvement of cokriging over kriging . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the same bivariate model ( [ eqn4 * ] ) and @xmath61 are observed at @xmath63 , but @xmath64 is observed at half of the points @xmath65 where @xmath44 is an even integer . </S>",
    "<S> denote the kriging predictor and cokriging predictor of @xmath46 by @xmath66 we will derive the following asymptotic relative efficiency of kriging to cokriging : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the correlation coefficient of @xmath64 and @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic relative efficiency of kriging prediction does not depend on the scale parameter @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively this is understandable . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a finite sample size @xmath44 , @xmath69 may affect the efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we now present a simulation study to see how @xmath69 and @xmath68 affect the relatively efficiency of kriging prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the exponential covariance model with @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the auxiliary variable @xmath75 is observed at @xmath76 , @xmath77 , but the primary variable @xmath62 is observed at @xmath76 for even integers @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the prediction variance for predicting @xmath46 using both kriging and cokriging and obtain the relative efficiency of kriging for different @xmath44 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figure1 ] plots the relative efficiency for different @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the relative efficiency of kriging decreases as @xmath44 increases , which means that it is more likely to see the outperformance of cokriging over kriging when @xmath44 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> when the spatial autocorrelation is strong ( i.e. , @xmath69 smaller ) , the asymptotic efficiency is achieved relatively faster ( i.e. , with @xmath44 not too larger ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with many other infill asymptotic results .    </S>",
    "<S> we now prove ( [ eqn9 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first note a markovian property of the exponential model established by du , zhang and mandrekar ( @xcite ) , which says @xmath79 only depends on the two nearest neighbors of @xmath80 in a finite set @xmath81 such that @xmath80 is between the minimum and the maximum elements of @xmath81 ( @xcite , @xcite , lemma  1 ) . also from the lemma </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath82 in the extreme case when @xmath83 , we can view the process @xmath64 being observed at @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> then in this extreme case , the above equation implies @xmath85 the ratio in ( [ eqn9 ] ) is clearly @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we have verified  ( [ eqn9 ] ) for this extreme case . on the other hand , when @xmath87 , the two predictors @xmath88 and @xmath89 are identical and ( [ eqn9 ] ) is obviously true .    </S>",
    "<S> we are going to show that @xmath90 where @xmath91 \\label{eqnb12 } \\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber b_3&= & b_6=-\\frac{r{{\\mathrm e}^{-2\\alpha / n}}}{{\\mathrm e}^{-4\\alpha / n}+1 } , \\\\ b_4&=&b_5=\\frac{r{\\mathrm e}^{-\\alpha / n}}{{\\mathrm e}^{-2\\alpha / n}+1}. \\label{eqnb45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] some straightforward calculation yields @xmath92    then ( [ eqn9 ] ) immediately follows . hence , it is sufficient to show ( [ eqn10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to show that @xmath93 is uncorrelated with any @xmath94 and with any @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath96 must be the best linear prediction . </S>",
    "<S> here we take an alternative but more intuitive approach . </S>",
    "<S> we will apply the markovian property of the gaussian exponential model to show that @xmath96 only depends on @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the coefficients @xmath103 s in ( [ eqnb12 ] ) and ( [ eqnb45 ] ) can be found by solving linear equations .    for any odd integer @xmath30 between @xmath104 and @xmath44 , @xmath105\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\quad = e \\bigl\\{e \\bigl(y_2(i / n)|y_2(t ) , t\\in o , t\\ne i / n \\bigr ) | \\\\ & & \\hspace*{55pt } y_1(s ) , s\\in o_1 , t\\in o , </S>",

    "<S> \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the above equation depends only on @xmath97 and @xmath98 due to the markovian property . for the second term , because the cross - covariance function is proportional to the covariance function of @xmath117 , we have @xmath118 applying again the property of conditional expectation and the markovian property , we get @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the constant in @xmath121 , and the last equation follows the fact that @xmath113 is independent to @xmath122 and @xmath100 if @xmath123 or @xmath1241 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the second term of ( [ eqn14 ] ) is a linear function of @xmath125 and @xmath126 and hence a linear function of @xmath127 , @xmath128 and 2 . </S>"
