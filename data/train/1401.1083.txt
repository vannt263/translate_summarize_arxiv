    "this study is concerned with the inversion of fundamental stellar parameters from the analysis of high - resolution echelle spectra .",
    "hereafter , we shall focus indeed on data collected since 2006 with the narval spectropolarimeter mounted at the 2-m aperture _",
    "tlescope bernard lyot _",
    "( tbl ) telescope located at the summit of the _ pic du midi de bigorre _ ( france ) .",
    "we investigate , in particular , the capabilities of the principal component analysis ( hereafter pca ) for setting - up a fast and reliable tool for the inversion of stellar fundamental parameters from these high - resolution spectra .",
    "the inversion of stellar fundamental parameters for each target that was observed with both narval and espadons spectropolarimeters constitutes an essential step towards : _ ( i ) _ the further post - processing of the data like e.g. , the extraction of polarimetric signals ( see e.g. , paletou 2012 ) but also _ ( ii ) _ the exploration , or data mining , of the full set of data accumulated over the last 8 years now . in section 2",
    ", we briefly describe the actual content of such a database .",
    "pca have been used for stellar spectral classification since deeming ( 1964 ) .",
    "it has been in use since , and more recently for the purpose of the _ inversion _ of stellar fundamental parameters from the analysis of spectra of various resolutions .",
    "it is however most often used _ together _ with artificial neural networks ( see e.g. , bailer - jones 2000 ; re fiorentin et al .",
    "pca is used there for reducing the dimensionality of the spectra before attacking a multi - layer perceptron which , in turns , allows to link input data to stellar parameters .",
    "our usage of pca for such an inversion process is strongly influenced by the one routinely made in _",
    "spectropolarimetry during the last decade after the pionneering work of rees et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . very briefly",
    ", the reduction of dimensionality allowed by pca is directly used for building a specific metric from which a nearest neighbour(s ) search is done between an observed data set and a learning database .",
    "the latter is made of synthetic data generated from input parameters properly covering the _ a priori _ range of physical parameters expected to be deduced from the observations themselves .",
    "a quite similar use of pca was also presented for classification and redshift of galaxies estimation by cabanac et al .",
    "fundamental elements of our method and its basic capabilities are exposed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "one of its originality relies on the simultaneous inversion of the effective temperature @xmath0 , the surface gravity log@xmath1 , the full metallicity [ m / h ] and the projected rotational velocity @xmath2 .    in this study",
    "we restrict ourselves , on purpose , to the spectral domain that will be observed by the rvs spectrometer on - board the gaia spacecraft ( katz et al .",
    "the rvs will finally operate in a spectral domain of the order of 847871 nm ( f. thvenin , private communication ) . however , for our study we shall use the nominal spectral domain mentioned up to 2012 in the litterature and which covers the spectral domain 847874 nm , at the vicinity of the caii infrared triplet .",
    "the pertinence of this choice for the further characterization of the observed stars was discussed by munari ( 1999 ) .",
    "this allows us to anticipate reasonable stellar parameter inversions for stars from b8 to m8 , a very large range of spectral types similar to the actual content of our database .",
    "the conditioning of observed spectra prior to their ingestion into our inversion tool is detailed in section 5 , and first tests made with solar spectra observed by reflection over the surface of the moon are discussed in section 6 .",
    "additional tests are also presented and discussed in section 7 , mainly for fgk - dwarf stars for which fundamental parameters are already available from the so - called spocs catalogue ( valenti & fisher 2005 ) .",
    "we then briefly discuss preliminary tests using spectra from giant stars as well as hotter and cooler than fgk stars .",
    "we mainly used narval data available from the _ public _ database tblegacy .",
    "narval is a state - of - the - art spectropolarimeter operating in the 0.38 - 1 @xmath3 m spectral domain , with a spectral resolution of 65000 in its polarimetric mode .",
    "it is an improved copy , adapted to the 2-m tbl telescope , of the espadons spectropolarimeter , in operations since 2004 at the 3.6-m aperture cfht telescope .",
    "the tblegacy database is operational since 2007 .",
    "it is at the present time the largest on - line archive of high - resolution polarization spectra .",
    "it hosts data that were taken at the 2-m tbl telescope since december 2006 .",
    "so far , more than 70000 spectra have been made available , for more than 370 distinct targets all over the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "more than 13000 _ polarized _ spectra are also available , mostly for _ circular _ polarization .",
    "linear polarization data are very seldom still and amount to a few hundreds spectra , but they are equally available .    at the present time , the tblegacy database provides no more than stokes @xmath4 or @xmath5 spectra calibrated in wavelength .",
    "stokes @xmath4 data are either normalized to the local continuum or not .",
    "we have however plans : _ ( i ) _ to extend it to espadons data from the cfht telescope and _ ( ii ) _ to propose higher - level data , such as pseudo - profiles resulting from line addition and/or least - squares deconvolution ( see e.g. , paletou 2012 ) , activity indexes as well as stellar fundamentals parameters",
    ". the latter s knowledge , besides being obviously interesting by itself , is also indispensable to any accurate further post - processing of these high - resolution spectra .",
    "these spectra are also generally bearing high signal - to - noise ratios , as can be seen in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "indeed stokes @xmath4 spectra we have been using result from the combination of 4 successive exposures , each of them carrying 2 spectra of orthogonal polarities generated by a savart plate - type analyser .",
    "this procedure of double so - called `` beam - exchange '' measurement is indeed meant for the purpose of extracting ( very ) weak polarization signals ( see e.g. , semel et al .",
    "our pca inversion tool is strongly inspired by magnetic and velocity field inversion tools which have been developed during the last decade to complement solar spectropolarimetry ( see e.g. , rees et al .",
    "improvements of this method have been recently exposed by casini et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for instance .",
    "hereafter we describe its main characteristics , in the context of our study .",
    "let us call \\{@xmath6 } our training database of _ synthetic _ stellar spectra .",
    "each of these spectra is characterised by a limited number of physical parameters which serve as input parameters for the numerical code producing them .",
    "usually , for so - called _ standard _ stellar models , the minimal set of parameters is the effective temperature of the star , @xmath0 , its surface gravity , log@xmath1 , its _ total _ metallicity [ m / h ] ( even though the specific iron abundance [ fe / h ] is also frequently used ) and a so - called microturbulent velocity @xmath7 which is an artificial contributor to line widths , in addition to thermal ( or doppler ) broadening .",
    "because a significant part of our database is constituted of moderately , say @xmath8 to fast rotators , we adopted the collection of spectra already computed and made available by munari et al .",
    "they used castelli & kurucz atlas code and they considered parameters spanning ranges from 3500k to 47500 k for @xmath0 , 0 . to 5 . for log@xmath1 , -2.5 to 0.5 for [ m / h ] , two distinct values , 0 .",
    "and 0.4 for [ @xmath9/fe ] , microturbulent velocities @xmath7 from 1 to 4 km@xmath10 and projected rotational velocities v@xmath11 ranging from 0 to 500 km@xmath10 .",
    "our training database contains about 34757 synthetic spectra after we limited ourselves to those spectra for which [ @xmath9/fe]=0 , which may affect our determinations of [ m / h ] for some objects , and @xmath12 which choice may also not be optimal for all of our observations . also , only the so - called `` new odf '' ( where odf stands for opacity distribution function ; see castelli & kurucz 2003 ) spectra were selected for @xmath13 k. hereafter we shall focus on the inversion of the set of four parameters \\{@xmath14 ; log@xmath1 ; [ m / h ] ; @xmath2 } for each of our observed spectra .",
    "it is also important to note that we used munari et al .",
    "( 2005 ) spectra computed for a resolving power of @xmath15 i.e. , about a factor of 3.25 _ less _ than the one of the observed spectra we want to process .",
    "we shall come back to this point in sections 5 and 9 .",
    "each spectra from espadons and narval spectropolarimeters provides of the order of 250000 flux measurements vs. wavelength across a spectral range spanning from 0.38 to 1 @xmath3 m typically .",
    "hereafter we consider only spectra obtained in the polarimetric mode at a resolvance @xmath16 . indeed ,",
    "one of our main objective is that stellar parameters derived from stokes @xmath4 spectra can be directly used for the further post - processing of the multi - line _ polarized _ spectra which comes together ( see e.g. , paletou 2012 and references therein ) .    for this assessment study , we put ourselves on purpose in a tough situation by restricting the spectral domain from which we shall invert stellar parameters to the ( initial ) one of the rvs instrument of the gaia space mission , that is for wavelengths ranging from about 847 to 874 nm ( katz et al . 2004 ) .",
    "arguments in favor of the use of this very spectral domain can also be found in munari ( 1999 ) . considering this ,",
    "the matrix @xmath17 representing our training database turns to be @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "next we compute the eigenvectors @xmath20 of the variance - covariance matrix defined as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the mean of @xmath17 along the @xmath23-axis .",
    "therefore @xmath24 is a @xmath25 matrix . in the framework of principal component analysis , reduction of dimensionality",
    "is achieved by representing the original data by a limited set of projection coefficients    @xmath26    with @xmath27 . in what follows for the processing of all observed spectra",
    ", we shall adopt @xmath28 .    the most frequent argument supporting the choice of @xmath29 relies on the accuracy achieved for the reconstruction of the original set of @xmath30 s from a limited set of eigenvectors ( see e.g. , rees et al . 2000 or ramrez vlez et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the present case",
    ", we display in fig.([fig2 ] ) the maximum reconstruction error    @xmath31    as a function of the maximum number of eigenvectors considered for the computation of the so - called _ admixture _ coefficients @xmath32 .",
    "it is noticeable that this reconstruction error is better than 1% for @xmath33 .",
    "however the potentiel effect of noise present in the observations we want to process should also be taken into account ( see e.g. , socas - navarro et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we shall discuss this specific point in the next section .",
    ".,width=359 ]    practically , we also found convenient to use , at every @xmath34 order , @xmath35 s both centered to their average @xmath36 and normalized to their standard deviation @xmath37 . it is a common practice in the field of pattern recognition , since it guarantees that those coefficients from which we shall define the specific metric used for the nearest neighbour(s ) search will have comparable effects ( on the comparison between spectra ) .",
    "the above described reduction of dimensionality allows one to perform a fast and reliable inversion of observed spectra , once the latter have been : _",
    "( i ) _ corrected for the wavelength shift vs. synthetic spectra because of the radial velocity of the target , _",
    "( ii ) _ continuum - renormalized as accurately as possible , _ ( iii ) _ degraded in spectral resolution to be comparable to the @xmath38 of the synthetic spectra and , finally _",
    "( iv ) _ resampled in wavelength as the collection of synthetic spectra .",
    "we shall come back to these various stages in the next section .",
    "however once these tasks have been achieved , the inversion process is the following .",
    "let @xmath39 the observed spectrum made comparable to synthetic ones .",
    "we now compute the reduced set of projection coefficients    @xmath40    where @xmath36 and @xmath41 are , respectively , the mean of the standard deviation of the @xmath42 s , for @xmath43 .",
    "the nearest neighbour search is therefore done by seeking the minimum of the squared _",
    "distance    @xmath44    where @xmath45 spans the number , or a limited number if any _ a priori _ is known about the target , of distinct synthetic spectra in the training database . in practice , we do not limit ourselves to the nearest neighbour search , although it already provides a relevant set of stellar parameters . because pca - distances between several neighbours may be of the same order",
    ", we adopted a procedure which consists in considering _ all _ neighbours in a domain    @xmath46    and derive stellar parameters as the ( simple ) mean of each set of parameters \\{@xmath0 ; log@xmath1 ; [ m / h ] ; @xmath2 } characterising this set of nearest neighbours ( a. lpez ariste , private communication ) .",
    "we did not notice significant changes in the results either for a smaller range of pca - distances or when adopting e.g. , distance - weighted mean parameters .",
    "before processing any real observed spectra with our pca - based inversion tool , we need to investigate on the potential effect of noise .",
    "to do so , we have ingested in our inversion tool multiple realisations of the content of the very learning database @xmath47 affected by controlled ( gaussian ) white noise - levels , and we estimated how it affects the inversion process by systematically comparing ( known ) input and inverted parameters .",
    ".standard deviation of the absolute differences between input and inverted parameters for noisy spectra vs. a ( gaussian ) white - noise level characterized by a @xmath48 per pixel standard deviation .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "because one of the originality of our inversion tool is in providing the projected rotational velocity of stars , we also tested its capability for a couple of fgk stars with significant ( @xmath49 ) @xmath2 and belonging the so - called `` stellar properties of observed cool stars '' ( aka .",
    "spocs ) catalogue ( valenti & fischer 2005 ) .    for a first test",
    ", we used a spectra from the pre - main sequence star hd377 and comparison between spocs parameters and ours are detailed in table [ table:2 ] . unfortunately , according to the pastel catalogue ( soubiran et al .",
    "2010 ) there are almost no alternative values given in the litterature for this object .",
    "its @xmath2 is well recovered and other parameters agree reasonably well with spocs values .",
    "our second target is @xmath50 boo ( a , also hd120136 ) , a f6iv star for which the spocs catalogue provides a @xmath2 of 15 km@xmath10 while our estimate is about 19 km@xmath10 . however",
    "a @xmath2 of about 18 km@xmath10 has been recently reported by martnez - arniz et al .",
    "other parameters agree very well , except for log@xmath1 that we systematically overestimated for these two objects .    a first excursion away from the fgk - dwarfs domain consists in exploring the luminosity class towards the giants domain . the red giant branch ( g5 ) star hd12328 have been used for that purpose .",
    "our results are again reliable given also that recent works mention an effective temperature of 4808 k , in better agreement with ours ( massarotti et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as log@xmath1 value of the order of 3.3 dex and [ fe / h]=-0.04 dex ( see also jones et al . 2011 ) . outside the spocs catalogue , and again for ( sub-)giants , we also used data from the k1.5iii star arcturus .",
    "our 4250 k determination of its effective temperature is very close , within 30 k , to that of prugniel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for instance .",
    "we could also derive a surface gravity about 2.0 in agreement with alternative estimates ( e.g. , massarotti et al .",
    "2008 ) and our [ m / h ] and @xmath2 values are also in pretty well identified ranges , as reported in table 2 .",
    "note that further tests with pollux ( k0iii ) data also gave excellent results .",
    "concerning these classes of stars , we are also perfectly aware that additional synthetic spectra with microturbulent velocities not restricted to 2 km@xmath10 as we did here , will have to be next considered .",
    "note also that for ( sub-)giant stars , models computed in ( 1d ) _ spherical _ geometry such as marcs ones ( gustafsson et al . 2008 ) may also provide a more realistic description of the observed stellar fluxes and therefore improve the determination of the inverted stellar parameters .",
    "our database of spectropolarimetric data already covers pretty well the h - r diagram .",
    "we are therefore interested in spanning most of it , and basically with the same inversion tool . selected targets for these further tests",
    "are indicated , together with the parameters we derived from their spectra , in table 2 .    for cooler stars , we picked spectra of gl 205 , a m1.5v dwarf .",
    "our values of @xmath0 ,",
    "log@xmath1 and [ m / h ] agree very well with those of prugniel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and our @xmath2 determination agrees well with the one of houdebine ( 2010 ) . there is also a reasonable agreement with values recently derived by neves et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "finally , we also tested our method with spectra of the a1v star sirius ( a ) .",
    "our inversion of the effective temperature gives a value a bit larger than the 9870 k more recently reported ( hill & landstreet 1993 ) .",
    "[ m / h ] is also overestimated , but log@xmath1 and @xmath2 are quite well determined .",
    "we are also aware that , so far , we restricted ourselves to models such that [ @xmath9/fe]=0 which may not apply to such a star . possible enhancement of @xmath9-elements will be considered in a next version of our inversion tool , when performing spectral analysis at a larger scale than the one presented here .",
    "however , besides this current restriction , the agreement between the observed spectrum and the nearest neighbour synthetic spectrum is already quite satisfactory , as shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "concerning the determination of @xmath2 , other methods of evaluation exist .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , they always require a template spectrum or at least a list of spectral line _ a priori _ expected in the spectra , as auxilliary and `` support '' data ( see e.g. , daz et al . 2012 and references therein ) .",
    "our final pipeline will therefore implement an additional module providing , once a preliminary stellar parameter inversion will be available from our inversion tool , an alternative and complementary @xmath2 evaluation .",
    "note also that , with our pca method , we are mostly interested in the `` intermediate '' @xmath2 regimes , say between 10 and 100 km@xmath10 .",
    "indeed , for slow rotators it is obvious that rotational broadening becomes of the order of other sources of broadening ( e.g. , instrumental or turbulent ) so that a more detailed line profile analysis may be required . on the other hand ,",
    "( very ) fast rotators are affected by macroscopic effects such as gravity darkening ( see e.g. , espinosa lara & rieutord 2011 ) which are not accounted for , so far , by standard atmospheric ( radiative ) modelling .",
    "another source of potential improvement relies on the content of our learning database .",
    "atlas standard models may not be the best choice for cool stars or for metal - poor stars for instance .",
    "it is also well - known that non - lte effects may take place in the formation of the infrared triplet of caii , which affects the spectral lines central depressions .",
    "this issue was for instance mentioned in kordopatis et al .",
    "more detailed elements , from the point of view of radiative modelling , are also discusses in merle et al . ( 2011 ) .",
    "finally , we shall need synthetic spectra computed for a resolvance comparable to the one of our observations and , ideally , including the effects of rotational broadening .",
    "the database of synthetic spectra , pollux ( palacios et al .",
    "2010 ) already provides a partial answer to our needs , and we believe that its development will take into account such needs .",
    "we have experimented a fast and reliable pca - based numerical method for the inversion of stellar fundamental parameters @xmath0 , log@xmath1 and [ m / h ] , as well as the projected rotational velocity @xmath2 , from high - spectral resolution echelle spectra taken from the narval spectropolarimeter in operations at the 2-m tbl telescope .",
    "our method is fast and easy to implement .",
    "first tests , mainly made for fgk - stars spectra show fairly good agreement with reference values published by valenti & fischer ( 2005 ) .",
    "preliminary tests also suggest that the same method is applicable to fgk ( sub-)giants , as well as to cooler m stars or hotter stars up to spectral type a. we used it , so far , at the vicinity of the infrared triplet of caii and without any help from additional ( e.g. , photometric ) information , which is particularly challenging .",
    "however we can easily , either extend the spectral domain used by our inversion method , or combine analyses from several distinct spectral domains , in order to constrain further and refine our stellar parameter determination .",
    "it is finally important to realize from the present study that pca allows for a reduction of dimensionality of the order of 100 ( @xmath51 ) which is of great potential interest for the post - processing of high - resolution spectra covering a very large bandwidth like the ones from both espadons and narval spectropolarimeters .",
    "we are grateful to dr .",
    "tomaz zwitter ( university of ljubljana , slovenia ) who made available the synthetic spectra used in the work .",
