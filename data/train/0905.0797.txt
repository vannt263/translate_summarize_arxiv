    "although it has been a decade since the discovery of the cosmic acceleration @xcite , the nature of dark energy ( de ) still remains a mystery .",
    "the most obvious theoretical candidate of de is the cosmological constant @xmath0 , which can fit observations well , but is plagued with the fine - tuning problem and the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "numerous other dynamical de models have also been proposed in the literature , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , @xmath6-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , holographic @xcite , agegraphic @xcite , hessence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , yang - mills condensate @xcite , ect .",
    "a most powerful probe of de is type ia supernovae ( snia ) , which can be used as cosmological standard candles to measure directly the expansion history of the universe . a large sample of nearby snia with @xmath7",
    "has recently been published @xcite . adding this to the union sample @xcite leads to the so - called constitution set @xcite which is currently the largest snia sample to date . by analyzing this constitution set with chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) ansatz @xcite , shafieloo et al .",
    "@xcite argue that cosmic acceleration may have already peaked and that we are currently witnessing its slowing down . by separating the redshifts into different bins and assuming a constant equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 in each bin , qi et al .",
    "@xcite also point out that this constitution set shows a deviation at 68.3% confidence level ( cl ) from the @xmath0cdm model . besides , by studying the constraints of de on the @xmath1 - @xmath8 plane , chen et al .",
    "@xcite claim that @xmath0cdm model is disfavored by the current observational data at 68.3% confidence .",
    "although constraining eos @xmath1 of de is a popular and widely - used method to investigate dark energy , wang and freese @xcite pointed out that de density @xmath2 can be constrained more tightly than eos @xmath1 given the same observational data .",
    "therefore , it would also be very interesting to consider the cases of piecewise constant @xmath2 . in this work",
    "we separate the redshifts into different bins , and discuss the models of a constant @xmath1 or a constant @xmath2 in each bin , respectively .",
    "binned fits of eos have been applied before in @xcite @xcite @xcite , and the union paper itself @xcite .",
    "similar analyses have been performed for density binning @xcite .",
    "our paper differs from previous ones in two aspects : first , in previous papers the redshift bins are determined by setting the discontinuity points of redshift by hand , while in our paper we treat the discontinuity points of redshift as free parameters , and find that much smaller @xmath9 can be obtained .",
    "second , not only the piecewise constant @xmath1 models but also the piecewise constant @xmath2 models are considered in this work .",
    "moreover , by comparing these two classes of model , it is found that for same number of redshift bins , a piecewise constant @xmath2 model always performs better than a piecewise constant @xmath1 model .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review the models considered here and the method of data analysis . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the observational data and describe how they are included in our analysis .",
    "section 4 is divided into three parts : first of all , we revisit the cpl model and find that for fitting the constitution set alone the behavior of de significantly deviate from the cosmological constant @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 will rapidly decrease along with the increase of redshift @xmath3 .",
    "this result implies that the behavior of dark energy might be very different in different slices of redshifts , and inspires us to separate redshifts into several bins and to investigate the piecewise constant @xmath1 model and the piecewise constant @xmath2 model .",
    "then , we discuss the models with two bins .",
    "it is found that for fitting the constitution set alone , @xmath2 will also rapidly decrease along with the increase of @xmath3 , which is consistent with the result of cpl model .",
    "moreover , a step function model in which @xmath2 rapidly decreases at redshift @xmath4 presents a significant improvement ( @xmath10 ) over the cpl parameterization , and performs better than other de models .",
    "we also plot the error bars of @xmath2 of this model , and find that this model deviates from the cosmological constant @xmath0 at 68.3% confidence level .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the models with three bins , and find that the cases of three bins are very similar with that of two bins .",
    "at last , we give a short summary in section 5 . in this work , we assume today s scale factor @xmath11 , so the redshift @xmath3 satisfies @xmath12 ; the subscript `` 0 '' always indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity , and the unit with @xmath13 is used .",
    "standard candles impose constraints on cosmological parameters essentially through a comparison of the luminosity distance from observation with that from theoretical models . in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ( the assumption of flatness",
    "is motivated by the inflation scenario ) , the luminosity distance @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the hubble parameter , @xmath18 is the hubble constant , @xmath19 is the present fractional matter density , and @xmath20 is a key function , because de parameterization schemes enter through @xmath21",
    ".    we will consider the familiar cpl ansatz @xcite , in which the eos of de is parameterized as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants .",
    "as is well known , the corresponding @xmath21 is given by @xmath25 for the case where eos @xmath1 is piecewise constant in redshift , @xmath21 can be written as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the eos parameter in the @xmath28 redshift bin defined by an upper boundary at @xmath29 .",
    "this class of models has been extensively studied in the literature . as mentioned above , it is interesting to consider the piecewise constant @xmath2 models . for this case",
    ", @xmath21 can be written as @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a a piecewise constant , and from the relation @xmath32 one can easily obtain @xmath33 .",
    "so for same number of redshift bins , the number of free parameters of piecewise constant @xmath2 model is one fewer than that of piecewise constant @xmath1 model .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are different opinions in the literature about the optimal choice of redshift bins in constraining de . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors directly set the discontinuity points of redshift as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . in @xcite ,",
    "wang argue that one should choose a constant @xmath37 for redshift slices . in this work ,",
    "we just treat the discontinuity points of redshift as model parameters in performing the best - fit analysis .",
    "as seen below , this leads to a much smaller @xmath9 .    in this work",
    "we adopt @xmath38 statistic to estimate parameters . for a physical quantity @xmath39 with experimentally measured value @xmath40 , standard deviation @xmath41 , and",
    "theoretically predicted value @xmath42 , the @xmath38 value is given by @xmath43 the total @xmath38 is the sum of all @xmath44s , i.e. @xmath45 assuming the measurement errors be gaussian , the likelihood function is given by @xmath46 for comparing different models , a statistical variable must be chosen .",
    "the @xmath47 is the simplest one , but it has difficulty to compare different models with different number of parameters . in this work , we will use @xmath48 as a model selection criterion , where @xmath49 is the degree of freedom defined as @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the number of data , and @xmath6 is the number of free parameters .",
    "besides , to compare different models with different number of parameters , people often use the bayesian information criterion @xcite given by @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the maximum likelihood .",
    "it is clear that a model favored by the observations should give smaller @xmath48 and @xmath54 .",
    "for snia data , we use the latest 397 constitution sample , the distance modulus @xmath55 , compiled in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the theoretical distance modulus is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 the hubble constant @xmath59 in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and @xmath60 is the hubble - free luminosity distance @xmath61 in a spatially flat frw universe , and here @xmath62 denotes the model parameters .",
    "the @xmath38 for the snia data is @xmath63 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_i^2},\\label{ochisn}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the observed value and the corresponding 1@xmath66 error of distance modulus for each supernova , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath67 is a nuisance parameter but it is independent of the data and the dataset . following @xcite , the minimization with respect to @xmath67 can be made trivial by expanding the @xmath38 of eq.([ochisn ] ) with respect to @xmath67 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_i^2},\\ ] ] @xmath70 @xmath71 evidently , eq . ( [ ochisn ] )",
    "has a minimum for @xmath72 at @xmath73 since @xmath74 , instead minimizing @xmath75 one can minimize @xmath76 which is independent of the nuisance parameter @xmath67 .      for bao data , we consider the parameter @xmath77 from the measurement of the bao peak in the distribution of sdss luminous red galaxies , which is defined as @xcite @xmath78^{2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "the sdss bao measurement @xcite gives @xmath80 , where the scalar spectral index is taken to be @xmath81 as measured by wmap5 @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that @xmath77 is nearly model - independent and can provide robust constraint as complement to snia data .",
    "the @xmath38 for the bao data is @xmath82 where the corresponding @xmath83 errors is @xmath84 .      for cmb data",
    ", we use the cmb shift parameter @xmath85 , which is given by @xcite @xmath86 where the redshift of recombination @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath85 relates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface , the comoving size of the sound horizon at @xmath88 and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak in cmb power spectrum of temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the measured value of @xmath85 has been updated to be @xmath89 from wmap5 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , different from the snia and bao data , the @xmath85 parameter can provide the information about the universe at very high redshift .",
    "the @xmath38 for the cmb data is @xmath90 where the corresponding @xmath83 errors is @xmath91 .",
    "we will present the results of cpl parameterization in this subsection .",
    "it is found that @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 for snia , snia+bao , and snia+bao+cmb data , respectively .",
    "moreover , we reconstructe @xmath95 and @xmath21 by using cpl parameterization , as is shown in figure [ fig - cpl ] .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig - cpl ] shows reconstructed @xmath95 and @xmath21 from snia data alone . from this panel",
    ", it is seen that @xmath1 and @xmath96 ( i.e. de density @xmath2 ) will rapidly decrease along with the increase of redshift @xmath3 , and the behavior of de significantly deviate from the cosmological constant @xmath0 at 1@xmath66 cl .",
    "it should be mentioned that our results are consistent with some other works .",
    "for example .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows that the best - fit value of @xmath24 is rather negative .",
    "this means that the eos @xmath1 of de will also be quite negative at high - redshift region .     reconstructed @xmath95 and @xmath21 from snia data alone ( upper panel ) and snia+bao+cmb data(lower panel ) using the cpl ansatz .",
    "red lines stand for the best - fit values and green lines stand for the @xmath83 cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]   reconstructed @xmath95 and @xmath21 from snia data alone ( upper panel ) and snia+bao+cmb data(lower panel ) using the cpl ansatz .",

    ", the result is quite different , and the @xmath0cdm model is still consistent with observational data at 1@xmath66 cl .",
    "the difference from these two panels of figure [ fig - cpl ] shows the existence of the tension among different types of observational data , which was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "their result of the cpl parametrization shows that for the union compilation when cmb and bao data is added there is a @xmath97 , while for the constitution set @xmath98 , which is much larger .",
    "their result is consistent with ours . besides , in @xcite the authors get @xmath99 for the cpl parametrization from snia+bao data , which shows the existence of tension between snia and bao data compared with the upper pannel of figure [ fig - cpl ] .    as mention above , for fitting snia data alone , we find that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 will rapidly decrease along with the increase of redshift @xmath3 by using cpl parameterization .",
    "this result implies that the behavior of dark energy might be very different in different slices of redshifts , and inspires us to separate redshifts into several bins and to investigate the piecewise constant @xmath1 model and the piecewise constant @xmath2 model .",
    "let us discuss the cases in which redshifts are separated into 2bins .",
    "hereafter we will call 2 bins piecewise constant @xmath1 model as xcdm2 model , and will call 2 bins piecewise constant @xmath2 model as @xmath0cdm2 model .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath9 versus redshift @xmath3 for xcdm2 and @xmath0cdm2 models , where only the constitution snia sample is used in the analysis .",
