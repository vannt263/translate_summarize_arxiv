    "recent production of cold antihydrogen @xcite has stimulated new theoretical and experimental interests on the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 system .",
    "the four particles of the greater @xmath4 system can be arranged in different ways leading to different types of states . on the one hand , there are states in the @xmath0-@xmath5 family in which the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 are not correlated but are orbiting around the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 respectively , with the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 appearing as composite particles .",
    "they are the lowest - energy states at large interatomic separations . on the other hand , there are states of the @xmath10 family for which the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 are highly correlated and orbit each other as in a positronium ( ps ) .",
    "the role of the @xmath10 family and the @xmath0-@xmath1 family is interchanged at short distances as the @xmath6-@xmath7-correlated state of the @xmath10 family becomes the state of the lowest energy , as indicated by the merging of the @xmath11 potential obtained by variational calculations with the @xmath12 potential obtained for the @xmath10 configuration , at small interatomic separations ( see fig .  4 below ) .",
    "because the @xmath9 and @xmath8 can orbit around ( and annihilate ) each other under their mutual coulomb and nuclear interactions @xcite , the @xmath10 family can be further bifurcated into subfamilies with a correlated or uncorrelated @xmath9-@xmath8 pair .",
    "there are also states that are hybrid of different families .",
    "if one can depict the orbiting of one particle relative to another particle as a `` dance pattern '' , then the dance patterns of the different families have distinctly different topological structures and connectivities .",
    "the distinct topological structures may allow them to retain some of their characteristics and stability .",
    "the mixing and the interplay between different families at different interatomic separations will provide a general idea on the  genealogy \" of the states . to be able to classify the greater @xmath13 system into families ,",
    "if at all possible , will bring us to a better understanding of the complexity of the spectrum that is associated with the complicated four - body problem , as well as to a better knowledge of the scattering between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 atom and the @xmath1 atom can scatter from each other at various energies .",
    "the problem of the @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering will require the knowledge of the interaction potential between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 as composite particles . as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 may rearrange into other configurations and",
    "may annihilate at short distances , the scattering problem needs to be treated in general in a coupled - channel analysis involving different interaction potentials and transition matrix elements @xcite .",
    "for the elastic channel , one often takes the interaction potential to be the adiabatic potential obtained in a variational calculation for the lowest - energy state of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 in the born - oppenheimer potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7 correlation property of the lowest - energy adiabatic state will undergo a change as the interatomic separation changes . at large interatomic separations ,",
    "the adiabatic lowest - energy state coincides with the incoming channel state of separated @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms with uncorrelated @xmath7 and @xmath6 orbiting around @xmath9 and @xmath14 , respectively . at small interatomic separations",
    ", the variational calculations will naturally lead to the lowest - energy adiabatic state involving strong correlations between the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 which differs from the elastic incoming channel by the presence of @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations .",
    "an adiabatic approximation involves altering the nature of the underlying state from the incoming elastic channel with no @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations to the other @xmath6-@xmath7-correlated channel , as the interatomic separation decreases .",
    "a general consideration of the channel coupling however will contain both the incoming elastic channel and the @xmath6-@xmath7-correlated channel in explicit coupling and transition .",
    "depending on the collision energy , the dynamics of the scattering process will lead to the adiabatic case with strong @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations at short separations in one limit of slow motion and large transition matrix elements .",
    "it will lead to the diabatic case with no @xmath6-@xmath7 correlation of the atomic @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the other limit . to carry out the explicit channel coupling for the general case of an arbitrary energy , or to see the cross - over to either the adiabatic or the diabatic limit",
    ", it is necessary to obtain the interaction potential for the incoming entrance channel of a @xmath0 and an @xmath1 .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus our attention on the interaction potential for this incoming entrance channel between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 as composite particles , for which the @xmath7 and the @xmath6 remain uncorrelated , orbiting around the @xmath9 and @xmath8 respectively , i.e. , without the loss of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 atomic identities .",
    "we are in effect trying to construct the interaction potential for one of the diabatic basis configurations in preparation for a general coupling of different diabatic basis states in a couple - channel analysis . for brevity of nomenclature",
    ", we shall use the term `` the interaction potential '' to refer to this potential between the composite particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath15 between the composite @xmath0 and the @xmath1 can also be used to investigate possible @xmath0-@xmath1 two - body molecular states of the @xmath0-@xmath1 family , as the composite @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms can form a bound system if their interaction potential is sufficiently attractive .",
    "these possible molecular two - body @xmath0-@xmath1 states , if they exists , belongs to the @xmath0-@xmath5 family , a subset of the states of the greater four - body @xmath13 system .",
    "one theoretical approach to study the lowest - energy state of the greater @xmath13 system is to use the variational method equipped with either explicitly correlated slater - type or gaussian - type orbitals with @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations .",
    "this method has provided a great wealth of information regarding the lowest - energy state of the four - body system @xcite . as our interest is focused on the properties of possible two - body states of the composite @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms , the two - body @xmath0-@xmath1 states of our interest may or",
    "may not necessarily be the lowest - energy state of the greater @xmath13 system .",
    "its relative position depends on the interatomic separation .",
    "we mentioned earlier that at large interatomic separations , the two - body state with separated atoms and leptons in the @xmath16 orbitals is the lowest - energy state of the greater @xmath13 four - body system . at small interatomic separations ,",
    "the two - body molecular state of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lies higher than the variational adiabatic lowest - energy state which is characterized by strong @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations , and the two - body molecular state of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 is an excited state of the greater @xmath13 system",
    ". it will be of great interest in future work to investigate how the two - body @xmath0-@xmath1 state may preserve or otherwise mix their distinct molecular characteristics with the @xmath6-@xmath7-correlated state , as the system dynamically traverses from large interatomic separations to the region of small separations .    to follow the four - body problem in the two - body atomic basis , we study the system from _ outside - in _ as the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 approach each other , and we examine their virtual excitations into excited @xmath0-@xmath1 configurations , as the interatomic distance decreases . a good method to carry out",
    "such an investigation is to use the perturbation theory , having the atomic @xmath0 and @xmath1 as unperturbed composite particles , as in previous study of molecular states in heavy mesons in hadron physics @xcite .",
    "the perturbation theory can be justified as a useful tool here because the composite @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms are neutral objects , and their residue interaction @xmath17 between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 contains four terms ( as given in eq .",
    "( [ vi ] ) below ) involving many cancellations due to the opposite charges of @xmath7 and @xmath9 of one atom on the one hand , and additional cancellations due to the opposite charges of the @xmath6 and @xmath8 of the other antiatom on the other hand . as a consequence ,",
    "the residue interaction is small in magnitude . using @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the dipole - dipole interaction and @xmath20",
    "is the energy denominator from the ground to the first excited state of the @xmath0 atom , we roughly estimated @xmath21 at interatomic separation @xmath22 = 3 , 5 and 8 a.u . to be @xmath23 0.05 , 0.01 and 0.003 , respectively .",
    "clearly , the next higher - order term involving the ratio @xmath24 will be even smaller and the perturbation series is expected to converge .",
    "therefore these numbers justify the application of the perturbation theory to the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction potential in intermediate interatomic distances ( i.e. , 3 @xmath25 10 a.u . ) .    within the perturbation theory ,",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction potential is at present known only within the leading order @xcite .",
    "it is positive for large distances , with a barrier whose peak lies in the region of short distances .",
    "it decreases precipitously at very short distances .",
    "previous analysis of the next - to - leading order interaction potential between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 assumed an expansion of the energy denominator up to the first order of the state energies @xcite .",
    "such an expansion may not be accurate .",
    "it is of interest to re - evaluate more accurately this interaction potential , @xmath15 , up to the next - to - leading order ( second order ) in the residue interaction @xmath17",
    ". we shall be interested in the interaction potential for the elastic channel for which the initial incoming and the final outgoing @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms are in their respective ground states at asymptotic separations .",
    "interaction potential for states with excited @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms at asymptotic separations can be similarly considered in a simple generalization .    for small interatomic distances ,",
    "the @xmath26-@xmath27 correlations become considerably important and we shall also study this additional @xmath26-@xmath27 correlation effects on the potential energy around this region of separation .",
    "needless to say , it is necessary in the future to include a greater number of the degrees of freedom , to take into account addition types of polarization of the two - body states .",
    "the perturbation theory results obtained here can provide a benchmark against which additional distortions may be measured .",
    "they can bring us to a better understanding of the scattering potential and the complexity of the spectrum that is associated with the four - body system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the formulation of the four - body problem in terms of the interaction of two composite objects using separable two - body basis . in section iii , we show how to evaluate the interaction matrix elements and the interaction potential . the results of the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction potential and the examination of the stability with respect to @xmath6-@xmath7 correlations are given in sections iv and v , respectively .",
