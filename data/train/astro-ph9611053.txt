    "the lyman-@xmath6 forest seen in quasar spectra ( lynds 1971 ; sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) is produced by absorption from diffuse hydrogen at high redshift .",
    "the big bang model predicts that approximately 25% of primordial baryonic matter should also be in the form of helium , and that there should therefore be corresponding absorption at shorter wavelengths from the  transition of singly ionized helium ( heii ) .",
    "it has recently become possible to detect redshifted heii absorption with space - based , ultraviolet ( uv ) observations ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1994 ; davidsen , kriss , & zheng 1996 ; hogan , anderson , & rugers 1996 ) .",
    "recent hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have been remarkably successful in reproducing the observed properties of the hi  forest ( cen et al .  1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter hkwm ; miralda - escud et al . 1996 ; dav et al .  1997 ;",
    "zhang et al .  1997 , rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    "we examine whether simulations like those of hkwm can also account for the observed heii absorption , and we consider their implications for the physical state of the absorbing gas .    the basic physics of intergalactic heii absorption is elegantly described by miralda - escud ( 1993 ) .",
    "the ambient background of uv radiation produced by quasars and ( perhaps ) young galaxies keeps the diffuse hydrogen of the  forest in a highly photoionized state , and it also ensures that most diffuse helium is singly or doubly ionized .",
    "however , the uv background intensity is lower at the ionization energy of heii ( 4 rydbergs , 228@xmath7 ) than it is at the hi ionization energy ( 1 rydberg , 912@xmath7 ) , and heii absorption can therefore be significant even in regions where the hi density is very low .",
    "heii absorption may be the only practical tool for directly observing regions that lie significantly below the cosmic mean density , revealing gas whose hydrogen  absorption might be buried in noise or removed in the process of continuum fitting . according to gravitational instability models of structure formation , the voids between galaxies should harbor a substantial portion of the baryonic matter in the universe . a homogeneous intergalactic medium ( igm ) would produce a uniform absorption trough in quasar spectra ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) . in a realistic gravitational instability model ,",
    "the matter in underdense regions should instead produce a fluctuating continuum of absorption ( reisenegger & miralda - escud 1995 ) .",
    "once the hydrogen in the universe has been reionized , the neutral helium fraction is expected to be small except in high density , collapsed regions . at fixed density and temperature ,",
    "the fraction of heii in highly photoionized gas is inversely proportional to the photoionization rate , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the specific intensity of the background at frequency @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ionization cross section for heii , and @xmath12 4 rydbergs .",
    "the hi fraction is inversely proportional to @xmath13 which is dominated by photons with energy between 1 and 4 rydbergs .",
    "measurements of the mean heii and hi  opacities can constrain the spectral shape of the uv background through the ratio of these integrals , @xmath14 , provided one has a model that specifies the density and temperature structure of the absorbing gas .",
    "the evolution of the uv background s intensity and shape can be tracked by the evolution of the mean opacities with redshift .",
    "the simulations provide a realistic model for the igm with the physical detail needed to exploit this approach , albeit a model whose properties depend ( as they should ) on the parameters of the underlying cosmological scenario .    for a given cosmological model , or indeed for any model igm",
    "in which most of the absorption arises in highly photoionized gas , the predicted mean opacity depends on the parameter combination @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the baryon density parameter ( e.g. , miralda - escud and ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "this scaling assumes that gas temperatures ( and hence recombination rates ) are unaffected by changes in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , an assumption that we will revisit in  3.2 .",
    "the simulations allow us to ask whether a cosmological model is consistent with the observed mean opacities given constraints on @xmath16 from big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , walker et al .",
    "1991 ) and on @xmath17 from the observed quasar population ( e.g. , haardt & madau 1996 ) or the proximity effect ( e.g. , bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "the simulations also predict distribution functions for hi and heii opacities and for the ratio of these opacities , which can be compared to observations in order to test the simulated igm .",
    "the possiblity of detecting heii absorption from diffuse intergalactic gas was one of the main scientific motivations for the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) , which first flew on the astro-1 mission in 1990 ( davidsen , private communication ) . while the quasar absorption experiment could not be carried out during astro-1 , because of pointing problems , it was successfully performed during the astro-2 mission in 1995 , as described by davidsen , kriss & zheng ( 1996 , hereafter dkz ) .",
    "the first detection of heii absorption was in fact achieved before astro-2 by jakobsen et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter jbdgjp ) , who used the hst faint object camera to observe the quasar q0302 - 003 ( z=3.28 ) .",
    "they measured a clear drop in the received quasar continuum across the 304@xmath7 ( rest - frame ) edge , and they inferred a high heii optical depth , @xmath18 at 90% confidence . because of the relatively low spectral resolution , the authors were unable to establish whether the absorption was caused mainly by material associated with individually identified hi lines or by a more diffuse component .",
    "jbdgjp , giroux , fardal , & shull ( 1995 ) , madau & meiksin ( 1995 ) , and songaila , hu , & cowie ( 1995 ) have explored the implications of these data for the shape of the uv background spectrum assuming different analytic models of the absorbing medium .",
    "if the absorption is dominated by discrete lines , then the spectrum must be quite soft , but a harder spectrum is allowed if most heii absorption arises in a diffuse , `` gunn - peterson '' background .",
    "we qualify this latter term with scare - quotes because the analytic models typically assume a uniform gunn - peterson effect , while the cosmological simulations predict a smoothly fluctuating , diffuse igm that blurs the traditional distinction between gunn - peterson absorption and the  forest ( hkwm ; see also miralda - escud & rees 1993 ; cen et al .",

    "q0302 - 003 was recently reobserved by hogan et al .  ( 1996 , hereafter har ) , using the goddard high resolution spectrograph on hst .",
    "har confirm jbdgjp s detection of heii absorption , but the higher spectral resolution of the ghrs observations reveals interesting new details .",
    "the transmission below the heii break remains fairly high ( @xmath19 ) within about 4000@xmath20 of the quasar .",
    "har attribute the relatively low heii fraction in this region to photoionization caused by q0302 - 003 itself , with the ionization zone terminated by a high column density hi absorber .",
    "they find a low but significant level of residual flux at shorter wavelengths corresponding to @xmath21 at 95% confidence .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath22 implies that helium remains predominantly doubly ionized even outside of the ionization zone produced by q0302 - 003 , presumably because of the ambient uv background .",
    "the upper limit depends on accurate background subtraction at the blue end of the spectrum , a challenging problem that is discussed in detail by har .",
    "hst can not probe heii absorption below @xmath23 .",
    "dkz took advantage of the shorter wavelength sensitivity of the hut to measure heii absorption in the spectrum of hs1700 + 64 ( z=2.743 ) .",
    "they find a mean opacity in the redshift range @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath25 , with some evidence that the opacity increases as a function of redshift over this range .",
    "the observed wavelength interval is @xmath26 and the spectral resolution @xmath27 , so the hut spectrum contains enough information to reveal structure in the residual flux .",
    "( the spectrum shown in dkz is averaged in @xmath28 bins . )",
    "the analysis in this paper will be aimed primarily at the hut observations .",
    "the physical issues are rather different for q0302 - 003 because of the important role of the observed quasar itself in ionizing the absorbing gas .",
    "we will therefore save a detailed comparison to the jbdgjp and har observations for a future paper .",
    "the numerical approach in this paper will be similar to that of hkwm , who use smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations to study the hi  forest in a critical density , cdm universe .",
    "studies of heii ( and hi ) absorption in eulerian - grid hydrodynamic simulations have been carried out by zhang et al .",

    "we will study the physical state of the gas that produces heii absorption in cdm - dominated , gravitational instability models of structure formation , relating it to and differentiating it from the gas that dominates hi absorption .",
    "we will use information on heii and hi in the context of these models to study the required uv background spectrum , its evolution with redshift , and the implied baryon density .",
    "we will examine several variants of the cdm scenario , enabling us to see which features are generic within this cosmological picture and which can be used as diagnostics for constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "we will also compare the simulation results to those of a simple model where all of the flux is absorbed in discrete lines .",
    "this sort of model is often used as a phenomenological description of the hi  forest , though it does not correspond physically to what happens in the simulations , where the absorbing structures are relatively diffuse and merge continuously into a fluctuating background .",
    "we obtain predictions that can be compared to future observational analyses that probe hi and heii absorption along a common line of sight .",
    "we have used the n - body plus sph code treesph ( hernquist & katz 1989 ; katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996 , hereafter kwh ) to simulate three different cdm - dominated cosmological models , the parameters of which are listed in columns  @xmath29 of table  1 .",

    "the power spectrum is normalized so that the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in @xmath33 spheres , linearly extrapolated to @xmath34 , is @xmath35 .",
    "this normalization is consistent with that advocated by white , efstathiou & frenk ( 1993 ) to match the observed masses of rich galaxy clusters , but it is inconsistent with the normalization implied by the cobe - dmr experiment .",
    "our second model is identical to the first except that @xmath36 .",
    "this higher amplitude is consistent with the 4-year cobe data ( bennett et al .",

    "the hkwm results suggested that a simulation with the hm background and @xmath71 would underproduce the observed hi  opacity , and we therefore reduced the amplitude of the hm background by a factor of two ( i.e. to half the values implied by equations 3 and 4 ) before evolving the simulations .",
    "we can recover the impact of different uv background intensities at the analysis stage , regardless of the specific value adopted during dynamical evolution , as discussed below in  3.1 .",

    "these are , respectively , the mean density and an overdensity of 10 at @xmath75 for @xmath4 .",
    "we will focus much of our analysis on this redshift because it is the simulation output closest to the middle of dkz s observed redshift range .",

    "thick lines show abundances for the hm background , with intensity reduced by a factor of three ( relative to hm ) , the value required for our scdm and ocdm models to reproduce the observed heii opacity ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "photoionization dominates completely over collisional ionization at low temperatures , where the hi and heii fractions fall as @xmath76 because of the temperature dependence of the recombination rates .",
    "collisional ionization becomes significant at high temperatures . raising the density increases the recombination rates and , therefore",
    ", the hi , hei , and heii fractions , though these never exceed their collisional equilibrium values . lowering the uv background by a constant factor would have the same effect on these plots as raising the density by the same factor .",
    "the _ shape _ of the background spectrum determines the relative fractions of hi and heii through the ratio of photoionization rates , @xmath14 .",
    "hm assume a @xmath77 power - law for the intrinsic uv spectrum of their quasar sources , but the ambient background that they compute is substantially softer because of reprocessing by the  forest .",
    "in particular , the spectrum at @xmath78 drops by a factor @xmath79 at @xmath80  rydbergs because of heii absorption .",
    "if we adopted a pure @xmath77 power - law with intensity chosen to produce the hi fractions in figure  1 , the heii fractions at low temperatures would be reduced by a factor of @xmath81 . with the @xmath72 power - law of hkwm",
    ", the reduction would be a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that these changes in equilibrium abundances have no dynamical impact on the simulations and minimal impact on the ability of the gas to cool in collapsed objects .",
    "the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into galaxies is nearly identical in simulations with the hm background and a @xmath72 background ( weinberg , hernquist , & katz 1996 ) .",
    "the  optical depth produced by a uniform medium with neutral hydrogen or singly ionized helium density @xmath83 is ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; miralda - escud 1993 ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the  oscillator strength , and @xmath88 is the transition wavelength ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 for hi and heii , respectively ) . in the simulations ,",
    "the intergalactic gas is not uniform , so the optical depth varies as a function of wavelength and angular position .",

    "absorption saturates for @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "as expected , these maps show stronger heii absorption than hi absorption .",
    "heii produces a substantial optical depth in regions that are nearly devoid of hi absorption , so heii measurements can probe low density structure that is virtually undetectable by other means .",
    "conversely , most regions with a significant hi optical depth produce saturated heii absorption .",
    "the sharp edges visible in some of the saturated heii features and the `` blobbiness '' of the weak heii absorption are probably artifacts of representing the gas distribution with a discrete set of particles .    for quantitative analyses ,",
    "we create simulated absorption spectra along random lines of sight through the simulation cube .",
    "knowing the temperature and density of each sph particle , we can compute the associated fractions of hi , hei , and heii given our assumed uv background . from these",
    "we compute the optical depths as a function of frequency by performing a line integral through the smoothing kernels of all sph particles whose kernels intersect the line of sight , taking into account hubble flow , peculiar velocities , and the thermal broadening appropriate to each of the absorbing species in order to transform from physical space to frequency space .",
    "details of this procedure are described in hkwm .",
    "figure  3a shows the redshift evolution of the effective mean optical depth for heii absorption , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the transmitted flux ( with @xmath97 corresponding to complete transmission ) .",
    "the average is performed over 100 lines of sight at each of the five output times .",
    "because of the non - linear dependence of flux on optical depth , @xmath3 is not the mean value of @xmath22 along the spectrum , but while @xmath98 can be measured from a spectrum of imperfect resolution and finite signal - to - noise ratio , the mean value of @xmath22 can not .",
    "thin lines show results for the three models with the uv background employed during dynamical evolution of the simulation , i.e. , the hm background divided by a factor of two .",
    "the intensity of this uv background at energies responsible for ionizing heii is approximately constant over the redshift range plotted here , though it does start to decline smoothly above @xmath99 .",
    "the mean optical depth decreases towards lower redshift primarily because the expansion of the universe reduces the heii fraction , since it lowers the physical density of the absorbing medium and hence the recombination rate per heiii ion . cosmic expansion also spreads the atoms in a given comoving region over a larger range in frequency .",
    "these are precisely the effects that determine the evolution of the gunn - peterson optical depth produced by a uniform igm with a constant uv background . the first effect ,",
    "which dominates here , would not apply to gas in collapsed , physically stable structures . while figure 2 shows that the absorption is by no means uniform , the rapid evolution of @xmath3 is a strong hint that the absorbing gas resides in low density structures that are still expanding with the cosmic background .",
    "the solid triangle in figure  3a shows har s observational estimate , @xmath100 ( 2@xmath101 errors ) at @xmath102 , measured outside the ionization zone produced by the observed quasar .",
    "the wavelength range contributing to this point is about @xmath103 .",
    "solid circles with error bars show @xmath3 at lower redshifts from the dkz spectrum .",
    "each point corresponds to a single @xmath28 bin from dkz s figure  1  we measured the extrapolated quasar continuum and observed flux from this figure and divided them to obtain @xmath104 .",
    "the error bars are @xmath105 and are based on the noise vector in dkz s figure .",
    "the fluctuations from point to point are larger and more coherent than expected from observational errors alone .",
    "they are presumably caused by large scale density variations , or possibly by inhomogeneity in the background radiation field .",
    "comparison between the data points and the thin lines in figure 3a shows that the cdm models produce roughly the correct trend of @xmath3 with redshift but have an overall level of absorption that is too low .",
    "the intensity of the ionizing background used during the dynamical evolution of the simulations is already a factor of two lower than that advocated by hm , but a further reduction is necessary to match the observed mean absorption . to quantitatively compare the models , we calculate the factor @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the photoionization rate required to match the observed heii optical depth and @xmath108 is the photoionization rate predicted by the hm background ( equations 3 and 4 ) . changing the intensity of the uv background within a broad range does not significantly alter the temperatures or spatial distribution of the absorbing gas , so we are able to estimate @xmath107 by rescaling the background after the simulation has been run but before creating simulated spectra ( see miralda - escud et al .",
    ", in preparation , for numerical tests of this scaling ) .",
    "in fact , because photoionization completely dominates over collisional ionization in the absorbing regions , we could obtain virtually identical results by the still simpler procedure of rescaling optical depths in the extracted spectra .",
    "the heii absorption value we match is the quoted value of @xmath109 at @xmath110 from dkz .",
    "we find @xmath111 by an iterative interpolation search , dividing the hm ionization parameters by different factors until we obtain the correct mean absorption . as we do not have a simulation output at @xmath110 , we linearly interpolate @xmath3 between @xmath75 and @xmath112 .",
    "the values of @xmath111 for the three cosmological models are listed in column  6 of table  1 .",
    "these factors are equal for the two low amplitude models , ocdm and scdm .",
    "the required value for the ccdm model is much higher .",
    "this model tends to produce less absorption at fixed @xmath17 because ( as we will show in detail later ) most of the flux decrement arises in large volumes that are near or below the mean density . at the higher mass fluctuation amplitude of ccdm ,",
    "more of the gas has flowed out of these void - like regions into higher density zones and collapsed objects ; the absorption from these regions is already saturated , so adding more gas to them does not increase the mean decrement .",
    "the heavy lines in figure 3a show @xmath3 with the rescaled ionization parameters .",
    "a single value of @xmath111 allows the models to fit the observed @xmath3 results at all redshifts from @xmath51 to @xmath102 , to within the scatter of the data points , indicating that the evolution predicted by the simulations is consistent with the observations if the uv background evolves as predicted by hm .",
    "although @xmath58 falls by only 20% between @xmath110 and @xmath102 , the models reproduce the factor of two difference between the dkz and har measurements of @xmath3 because of the cosmic expansion effects discussed earlier .",
    "figure 3b shows the effective mean optical depth of hi absorption , @xmath113 , for the three cdm models .",

    "the straight dotted line in figure 3b shows the power - law fit @xmath114 found by press , rybicki , & schneider ( 1993 , hereafter prs ) in their analysis of the mean flux decrement in a sample of 29 high - redshift quasars .",
    "the hatched box shows the redshift extent of points used to compute this fit and the @xmath105 statistical uncertainty in the fit .",
    "prs computed the mean decrement by extrapolating the quasar continuum from the region redward of  emission into the  forest region .",
    "zuo & lu ( 1993 , hereafter zl ) estimated the mean decrement from higher resolution spectra by directly fitting the continuum to the regions of lowest absorption in the forest .",
    "we indicate their results by the filled circles in figure 3b .",
    "clearly the two observational determinations disagree by far more than their statistical uncertainties .",
    "a recent analysis of keck hires spectra , using an approach similar to zl s but data of higher resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , yields mean decrements that are much closer to the prs values than to zl s ( rauch et al .",
    "we will therefore proceed on the assumption that the prs determination is accurate , but the systematic uncertainty in existing estimates of @xmath2 is worth keeping in mind , as a major change to these estimates would affect our conclusions about the shape of the uv background spectrum .",
    "once the background intensity has been divided by the factor @xmath111 , the effective hi optical depths agree fairly well with the prs determination , though they tend to rise above it at the low and high ends of our redshift range . to better quantify this agreement , we list in columns 7 and 8 of table 1 the scaling factors @xmath115 ( defined analogously to @xmath111 ) by which the hm background must be divided in order that the simulation match the prs optical depths at @xmath51 and @xmath116 .",
    "these factors match the corresponding values of @xmath111 to 20% or better in most cases ( 30% for ccdm at @xmath51 ) , indicating that the cosmological simulations and the hm spectral shape are , taken together , consistent with the joint observational constraints of dkz and prs .",
    "the hi scaling factors at @xmath51 and @xmath116 are also similar , indicating that the simulations reproduce the prs evolution law over this redshift range if the uv background evolves as predicted by hm . if this analysis is extended to @xmath117 , however , the simulations require a roughly constant @xmath57 ( hkwm ; rauch et al .",
    "1997 ) , while the hm model predicts a substantial drop in @xmath57 towards high redshift because of the declining number density of quasar sources .",
    "the uncertainty on the correct value of @xmath111 is mainly statistical , and is dominated by the fact that an observational measurement of @xmath3 is only available from one qso .",
    "the theoretical estimates at z=2.33 come from 200 lines of sight through the simulation box , which together cover a redshift patch equal to @xmath118 times the useful length of the dkz spectrum .",

    "jbdgjp suggested that the high heii optical depth towards q0302 - 003 might arise because the heii `` stromgren spheres '' around quasars had not overlapped by @xmath102 , leaving most of the universe optically thick to heii ionizing photons . supporting evidence for this scenario comes from a rapid change at @xmath121 in the siiv / civ ratios measured in  absorbers , which suggests a change in the shape of the uv background spectrum that could correspond to percolation of quasars heii ionization zones ( songaila & cowie 1996 , but see also hellsten et al 1997 ) .",
    "our results show that , in the cdm models , no major change in the spectral shape is needed to explain the existing heii data .",
    "indeed , if har s upper limit on @xmath3 is taken at face value , then the background spectrum can not be much softer than the hm spectrum at @xmath102 , at least along this line of sight .",

    "however , since the hm background is based on the observed population of quasar sources ( with a modest extrapolation for quasars below existing survey detection limits ) , it is difficult to see how the true background could be lower than the hm background by such large factors .",
    "reductions of this magnitude would also make the background intensity inconsistent with estimates from the proximity effect ( giallongo et al .",
    "1996 and references therein ) , though these are subject to significant systematic uncertainties . even allowing for the imperfect resolution of the simulations and plausible uncertainties in the background intensity",
    ", it seems that these cosmological models for the  forest are at best marginally compatible with the prs opacity measurements if @xmath4 .",
    "the alternative to lowering the uv background is to raise the mean baryon density .",
    "the  optical depth is proportional to the number density of absorbing atoms ( see equation  [ [ eqn : gp ] ] ) , which for highly photoionized gas is proportional to the square of the gas density divided by the photoionization rate .",
    "the second power of density arises because the the recombination rates per hii or heiii ion are themselves proportional to the density .",
    "if the distribution of _ over_densities ( @xmath125 ) and gas temperatures in the igm is unchanged by altering @xmath16 , then the optical depth @xmath126 at a specified redshift along a line of sight is proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "note that the effective mean optical depth @xmath128 is not simply proportional to @xmath127 because of the non - linear nature of flux averaging , but it is still the case that raising @xmath16 by a factor @xmath129 should have the same effect as lowering @xmath17 by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "the assumption that the absorbing gas is highly photoionized breaks down in regions that are collisionally ionized ( e.g. , hot gas in virialized halos ) or predominantly neutral ( e.g , damped  systems ) , but these are too rare to make much contribution to @xmath128 .",
    "we have completed one simulation of the scdm model with @xmath130 instead of 0.05 , and we find that the scaling of @xmath126 with @xmath16 is weaker than the above argument would suggest , roughly @xmath131 instead of @xmath132 .",
    "the reason is that raising @xmath16 also raises the gas temperature in the low and moderate density regions ( @xmath133 ) that produce most of the absorption , because increasing the hi and heii fractions allows a given volume of gas to absorb energy from the photoionizing background at a higher rate .",
    "since the recombination rates decline as @xmath76 in the relevant temperature regime , the hi and heii fractions do not rise by the full @xmath134 factor when @xmath16 is increased .",
    "the physics of the @xmath16 scaling does not depend on the cosmological scenario , and we therefore expect the result derived from our pair of scdm simulations to hold more generally ( but see the discussion of reionization effects at the end of  3.4 ) .",
    "one might think that reducing @xmath17 at fixed @xmath16 would also alter the gas temperatures , but it does not , because the increase in hi and heii fractions is exactly compensated by the smaller rate of photoionizations per ion .",
    "the scaling @xmath135 is therefore preserved unless the _ shape _ of the ionizing background , which determines the mean residual energy per photoelectron , is altered .    with these scalings in mind",
    ", we can relate the values of @xmath115 and @xmath111 listed in table 1 to the combination of @xmath17 , @xmath16 , and @xmath136 that is required for the simulation to match the observed mean opacity : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the value of @xmath136 adopted in the simulation .",

    "hei absorption is non - negligible only in the highest density region of the second spectrum , where the high recombination rate increases the relative fraction of neutral helium .",
    "heii absorption , on the other hand , is quite strong , and most of it arises in regions where the hi optical depth is quite low . the ratio @xmath148 ( shown by the solid line in the third panel ) is about a factor of eight over most of the spectrum . the hi and heii flux decrements , @xmath149 , are nearly equal when the hi optical depth is high , but when @xmath150 is small the heii flux decrement is eight times higher .",

    "if we instead assumed that the igm at @xmath212 retained significant heat from reionization , then the temperatures of the unshocked or weakly shocked gas would be higher and less dependent on density .",
    "recall that for the gas that produces most of the absorption , the hi and heii optical depths are proportional to @xmath213 . with hotter gas",
    ", the required values of @xmath115 and @xmath111 would therefore be higher , i.e. , our models would require a less intense uv background or a higher baryon density in order to match the observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for a fixed reionization history , the @xmath214 dependence in equation  ( 8) would be closer to @xmath215 , since the effect of reionization heating on gas temperatures does not depend on @xmath16 ( though the subsequent photoionization heating does ) .",
    "the magnitude of these effects depends on the reionization model ; plausible models could increase @xmath115 and @xmath111 by @xmath216 ( see the discussion by hui & gnedin 1997 ) .",
    "however , once the simulations were normalized to the observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we would expect the statistical properties of the absorption to be very similar to those computed here , with small changes reflecting the weaker dependence of optical depth on density and the larger degree of thermal broadening .",
    "plausible changes in the reionization history all go in the direction of increasing rather than decreasing igm temperatures , so they only tend to raise the lower bounds to @xmath146 discussed in  3.2 .",
    "igm temperatures and corresponding @xmath146 limits could be lower if the uv background spectrum is substantially softer than the hm spectrum , so that the mean residual photoelectron energy is lower .",
    "many previous discussions of heii absorption have focused on distinguishing `` line blanketing '' in the forest from `` gunn - peterson '' absorption by the igm .",
    "our cosmological simulations undermine the premise of this effort , for they suggest that heii absorption and the low column density   forest _ both _ arise in diffuse , smoothly fluctuating , intergalactic gas . local maxima in the optical depth",
    "can be identified as lines , but individual features do not , as a rule , correspond to compact structures that are sharply separated from their environment . while the  forest and the heii flux decrement are both manifestations of the igm , the high ratio of heii ions to hi atoms does lead to an important systematic difference between helium and hydrogen absorption",
    ": heii absorption is stronger in the mean , and much of it arises in underdense regions that have low hi optical depth .",
    "the general picture of the igm presented here is similar to that in the other numerical simulation papers cited in the introduction , and it has much in common with the semi - analytic models developed by bi ( 1993 ) , bi , ge , & fang ( 1995 ) , bi & davidsen ( 1997 ) , and hui , gnedin , & zhang ( 1997 ) .",
    "these semi - analytic models lead to similar qualitative conclusions about the properties of the gas producing heii absorption ( davidsen , private communication ; davidsen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "some of the more specific conclusions from our analysis are as follows : + ( 1 ) the cdm models account for the observed relative values of @xmath2 ( from prs ) and @xmath3 ( from dkz and har ) if the uv background has the spectral shape predicted by hm .",
    "large changes in the spectral shape ( or in the observational estimates ) would spoil this agreement .",
    "+ ( 2 ) these models account for the observed absolute values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 only if ( a ) the overall intensity of the background is lower than predicted by hm , or ( b ) the baryon density is higher than our assumed value of @xmath4 .",
    "if we set the background intensity equal to the hm value , then the scdm and ocdm models require @xmath217 , and the ccdm model requires @xmath218 .",
    "we have analyzed one scdm simulation with a higher baryon density , @xmath219 .",
    "if @xmath58 is held fixed , then this model produces stronger heii absorption than the original scdm model , as expected .",
    "once both models are normalized to produce the same @xmath3 , the statistical properties of their heii absorption ( e.g. , the measures considered in  3.4 ) are virtually identical .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the cdm models naturally explain the observed evolution of @xmath3 , in particular the factor of two drop in @xmath3 between @xmath220 ( har ) and @xmath221 ( dkz ) , provided @xmath58 evolves at the rate calculated by hm .",
    "change in the uv background does not play a major role in this evolution  @xmath58 grows by only 20% between @xmath102 and @xmath110 .",
    "the strong evolution of @xmath3 is instead driven by the expansion of the universe , which lowers gas densities and spreads absorbing material over larger frequency ranges .",
    "the high heii optical depth measured by har does not imply that heii reionization occurred at @xmath122 .",
    "if the har upper limit of @xmath222 outside the q0302 - 003 ionization zone is correct , then the photoionizing background along this line of sight can not be much softer than hm predict .",
    "+ ( 4 ) most of the heii opacity is produced by diffuse gas that follows a well defined relation between temperature and density .",
    "this relation has its origin in the competition between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling . for gas that lies on this temperature - density relation ,",
    "the heii optical depth is a simple function of density , @xmath223 . to a first approximation",
    ", one can regard a heii ( or hi ) absorption spectrum as a non - linear map of the gas density along the line of sight .",
    "+ ( 5 ) a significant fraction of the heii absorption arises in regions with density contrast @xmath224 , for which linear perturbation theory will give inaccurate results .",
    "analytic methods that treat this density regime more accurately , such as the modified zeldovich approximation of reisenegger & miralda - escud ( 1995 ) , may provide useful guides to the behavior of heii absorption in cosmological models , especially in light of point ( 4 ) above .",
    "+ ( 6 ) the three cdm models that we have investigated predict similar statistical properties of the heii absorption ( e.g. , distribution functions of @xmath22 and @xmath151 ) , once they are normalized to produce the same mean absorption .",
    "the ccdm model predicts somewhat broader distribution functions than the scdm or ocdm models because of its higher mass fluctuation amplitude .",
    "because this model has emptier voids , it also requires a lower uv background intensity and/or higher @xmath46 to reproduce the observed @xmath3 , and it requires a slightly softer background spectrum to account simultaneously for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the scales of our simulation , the three cdm models have power spectra of similar shapes , and",
    "their rms fluctuation amplitudes differ by less than a factor of two , so we do not yet know how the absorption results might change for much steeper or shallower power spectra or for models that have very different fluctuation amplitudes on these scales .",
    "+ ( 7 ) the cdm models have very different heii absorption properties from our `` line models , '' which assume that the heii absorption is produced by randomly distributed , voigt - profile lines with @xmath168 and a lower cutoff at @xmath225 . in particular , the line models have gaps in which the heii absorption is very low , and a larger fraction of their heii absorption arises in regions of high hi optical depth .",
    "the fluctuating igm of the cdm models produces fluctuating heii absorption , but absorption - free regions ( @xmath226 ) are very rare .",
    "the line models require a softer uv background spectrum in order to produce the observed @xmath3 , especially if the lines are thermally broadened .",
    "the statistical differences between the line models and the cdm models are greatly reduced when the spectra are smoothed , so for distinguishing these scenarios it is desirable to use heii spectra with the highest resolution practical .",
    "if the minimum column density in the line models is pushed well below @xmath175 , the differences from the cdm models are less striking , as weak lines overlap to produce a continuous , fluctuating background .",
    "+ ( 8) about half of the contribution to @xmath3 comes from regions that have @xmath227 . in the cdm models ,",
    "most of the absorption in this regime is produced by a smoothly fluctuating igm rather than the wings of strong absorption lines .",
    "the absorption is not uniform , but because the hi optical depth is low and the variations are gentle , much of the corresponding hi absorption could be inadvertently removed from optical quasar spectra in the process of continuum fitting .",
    "the cdm simulations provide a model of the high redshift igm .",
    "once it is normalized to the observed values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , this model yields a number of testable predictions .",
    "first , the shape of the uv background spectrum should be close to that predicted by hm , with @xmath176 , for @xmath228 .",
    "it is difficult to measure the background shape precisely independent of an igm model , but tests using metal line ratios ( songaila & cowie 1995 ) or comparisons of the hi and heii proximity effects ( see zheng & davidsen 1995 ) might be able to identify strong departures from the hm spectral shape . if one adopts the intensity of the hm background as a lower limit , then our models also predict that the baryon density exceeds the `` conventional '' big bang nucleosynthesis estimate of @xmath4 by a factor @xmath229 ( see rauch et al .",
    "1997 and weinberg et al .",
    "1997 for further discussion ) .",
    "the most direct and quantitative predictions of this igm scenario are statistical properties of the absorption such as those shown in  3.4 .",
    "in particular , observational analyses can test the predictions that a large fraction of the heii opacity arises in regions of low hi optical depth and that there are few regions where @xmath22 itself is very low .",
    "the dkz spectrum offers the largest redshift range for statistical analyses of heii absorption .",
    "however , the distinctive features of this igm model are most stringently tested at high spectral resolution , so hst observations at @xmath230 can also play an important role . an anecdotal but significant argument in favor of this igm model is provided by har , who show that strong heii absorption ( @xmath231 ) persists in a region where a keck hires spectrum reveals no hi  lines down to a detection threshold @xmath232 .",
    "careful comparison between the simulations and heii observations should include realistic treatments of noise , instrumental resolution , the redshift range of the observations , and so forth .",
    "the three variants of the cdm model considered in this paper yield fairly similar predictions , and given the inevitable limitations of heii measurements with existing instruments , we anticipate that hi observations will be a more powerful tool for distinguishing among them",
    ". however , heii absorption provides a vital test of this general scenario for high redshift structure , checking one of its basic predictions in a regime that is almost inaccessible to other methods . in theories of structure formation like those studied here , underdense regions of the universe harbor a substantial amount of diffuse baryonic material .",
    "if these theories are even roughly correct , then the recent studies of heii absorption in quasar spectra have detected this material at high significance .",
    "more detailed analyses of existing absorption data can test this claim .",
    "future instruments that can observe heii absorption at high spectral resolution could yield a precise view of structure in the sparsest regions of the high - redshift universe .",
