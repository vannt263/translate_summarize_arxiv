    "the structure and thermodynamics of confined dipolar fluids ( such as molecular liquids , ferrofluids , and electrorheological fluids ) have recently attracted considerable attention .",
    "theoretical @xcite , computer simulation @xcite , and experimental @xcite studies have provided significant information about the orientational and spatial arrangement of dipolar particles in the vicinity of solid walls .",
    "the strongly anisotropic and long - ranged character of dipolar forces causes particular difficulties for the theoretical description of these systems . as long as one is not aiming for a quantitative description of a specific system but for general phenomena and trends ,",

    "it considers spherical particles interacting with lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potentials plus pointlike permanent dipoles at their centre . in this paper",
    "we adopt the magnetic language , assuming that the particles carry magnetic dipole moments of strength @xmath0 because the main applications we have in mind are ferrofluids .",
    "( the results are identical for ferroelectric particles . )",
    "bulk dipolar fluids such as the stockmayer model system may exhibit three distinct fluid phases : isotropic vapor , isotropic liquid , and ferromagnetic liquid @xcite .",
    "( in the present study we focus on sufficiently high temperatures so that freezing is not a concern @xcite . ) accordingly the following first - order phase transitions can occur : isotropic vapor isotropic liquid , isotropic liquid ferromagnetic liquid , and isotropic vapor ferromagnetic liquid .",
    "the phase diagrams exhibit the usual liquid - gas critical point , a triple point , a tricritical point , and a line of critical points corresponding to second - order phase transitions between the isotropic and the ferromagnetic liquid . for bulk",
    "dipolar fluids these phase transitions and critical points and lines have been detected in various theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge there is no theoretical study which predicts the complete global phase diagrams and the structure of _ confined _ dipolar fluid phases .",
    "recently gramzow and klapp @xcite have studied the phase behavior and orientational structure of stockmayer fluids confined to slit pores . within their modified mean - field ( mmf ) density functional theory ( dft ) they considered only the subspace of spatially homogeneous local densities throughout the slit pore and focused on the orientational structure only .",
    "this allowed them to study the influence of the confinement on the phase behavior but neglecting the inevitable spatial inhomogeneities of the phases under study .",
    "our results will show that in the case of confined dipolar liquids , as for other fluids , there are strong spatial inhomogeneities in the vicinity of the walls .",
    "this inhomogeneous character of the liquid phases becomes more pronounced upon increasing of the density .",
    "these phenomena require a more sophisticated theory in order to describe the structure and the phase equilibria of confined dipolar systems .    in the present study we also use the modified mean - field ( mmf )",
    "dft approximation .",
    "however , for the description of the hard sphere reference system , instead of the homogeneous bulk carnahan - starling free energy expression , a fundamental measure theory free energy functional @xcite is applied in order to capture the short - ranged hard sphere like correlations .",
