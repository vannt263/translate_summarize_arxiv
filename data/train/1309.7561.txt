    "an important aspect of quantum mechanics is the existence of states that have no classical analogue .",
    "such `` virtual states '' can not exist in classical physics as they violate energy conservation .",
    "it is commonly suggested that their presence within quantum mechanics as short - lived states is allowed by the uncertainty principle  @xcite @xmath0 .",
    "these states , being volatile , are destroyed by a strong measurement , and are therefore inaccessible to direct detection . by contrast , weak measurement , along with its weak backaction , may provide us with a nondestructive probe into virtual states .",
    "in fact , weak measurement based protocols with postselection [ _ weak values _ ( wv ) ]  @xcite have been employed with remarkable success in explaining quantum paradoxes  @xcite , detecting and amplifying weak signals  @xcite , directly measuring a wave - function  @xcite and devising protocols for quantum states discrimination  @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to extend the utility of wvs to the arena of many - body states , specifically probing virtual many - body states .",
    "this task is accomplished here for the first time , by specifically considering the process of cotunneling  @xcite . in the latter",
    ", electrons are transported between a source ( @xmath1 ) and a drain ( @xmath2 ) through a quantum dot ( qd ) ; the qd is tuned such that the addition of an extra charge to it is classically forbidden ( the coulomb blockade regime )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an electron can enter the qd and later exit , forming a ( short - lived ) virtual many - body correlated state .",
    "this cotunneling process is qualitatively different from a single particle tunneling under the barrier .",
    "we design a weak value protocol , amenable to experimental test , tailored to measure the lifetime of such a many - body virtual state .",
    "we anticipate that our demonstration of feasibility of such a protocol will pave the road to the study of a host of many body problems that involve virtual states .",
    "the second goal of our work is the study of the specifics of cotunneling life - time .",
    "the lifetime of a virtual state associated with the tunneling of a single particle under a barrier has been studied extensively with a variety of approaches  @xcite .",
    "there are several time scales involved in this process : the dwell time , @xmath3 , marks the lifetime of the virtual state regardless of whether the electron is eventually transmitted ( to @xmath2 ) or reflected ( to @xmath1 ) ; the traversal time is the lapse between the disappearance of an electron from @xmath1 and its appearance in @xmath2 . for the tunneling of a single particle",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the time is related to the imaginary velocity of the particle under the barrier .",
    "determining the traversal time in the many - body cotunneling case poses a more difficult challenge , elucidated below .",
    "here we show that naive expectations based on analogy with a single particle tunneling are unfounded .",
    "strikingly we also find that the cotunneling time , @xmath4 , may not be related to the time - energy uncertainty relation  @xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the violation of energy conservation in the virtual state .",
    "finally we note that , while by classical intuition the transmission time through a qd should depend on the dot - lead tunneling matrix element , this turns out not to be the case here .",
    "our results are summarized in table  1 .",
    "we find that @xmath4 depends parametrically on whether the cotunneling is dominated by elastic or inelastic processes .    in the following , after defining our model of a detector",
    "weakly coupled to a quantum dot tuned to the cotunneling regime , we review the measurement time in the regime of sequential tunneling , where the transport occurs through classical probability rates of tunneling in and out of the dot . employing the same setup",
    ", we present a semi - heuristic procedure through which we define the cotunneling time .",
    "we then show that this definition coincides with the quantity obtained relying on a weak - value based protocol .",
    "we finally compute the cotunneling time in the various relevant parameter regimes .",
    "our setup [ cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : sistema](a ) ] , consists of a system ( a quantum dot weakly coupled to leads ) and a detector [ a quantum point contact ( qpc ) ] .",
    "the detector measures the system through the electrodynamic coupling between them . the way this setup is defined it is suitable to discuss both transport that involves real processes ( sequential tunneling ) as well as virtual processes ( cotunneling ) .",
