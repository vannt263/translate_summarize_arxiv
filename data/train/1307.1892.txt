    "the weak oscillations in the shear modulus calculations are a result of the high degree of the polynomial fit .",
    "we note that the oscillations in the shear modulus fits are much smaller than the large overall structure that we observe near the transitions between @xmath10cfcs , implying that the latter is not an artifact of the fitting procedure .",
    "we have performed fits over the entire filling factor range that each @xmath10cfc exists , but have only shown the fits and their corresponding shear modulus for @xmath92 ( or @xmath160 ) .    as a benchmark , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctp0 ] we compare our calculated shear modulus for the @xmath161cfc , which is a slater determinant of otherwise uncorrelated electron wave packets , with that obtained previously by mz .",
    "the two curves are very similar , but not identical .",
    "the difference arises because while the @xmath161cfc is a fully antisymmetrized wave function , the mz calculation imposes only pairwise antisymmetry , which is a good approximation only for small @xmath2 .",
    "we believe that the shear modulus obtained in our calculation is more reliable .",
    "interestingly , while maki - zotos results shows an instability of the crystal for @xmath162 , where the shear modulus becomes negative , our calculation eliminates that instability .",
    "of course , both are subject to the approximation that neglects three and higher body terms in the effective model mapping it into a crystal of classical particles . for other values of @xmath9 , both the modified interaction between composite fermions and the antisymmetrization contribute to the deviation from the mz shear modulus . given that the distance between the neighboring lattice sites is large compared to the magnetic length , we expect that the assumption that the interaction is dominated by 2-body terms is accurate for @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "however , as @xmath163 begins to approach unity , this approximation clearly breaks down ( at @xmath88 we do not even have a crystal , but a liquid ) .",
    "fortunately , the physically relevant regions ( i.e. where the shear modulus is shown by solid lines ) correspond to @xmath92 , with the exception of the filling factor @xmath164 .",
    "recently , muraki and collaborators @xcite have found that the spectral line shape of the nmr spectra contains information about the electron density distribution , because the knight shift is proportional to the local electron density .",

    "<S> a qualitative change in the behavior and a decreasing pinning frequency below @xmath113 may indicate a transition into a @xmath49cfc , although further work will be needed for a conclusive statement . </S>",
    "<S> we note that unlike for mz or lg crystals , the pinning frequency of the cfc is predicted to have a complicated dependence on @xmath2 and can sometimes decrease with increasing @xmath2 in the regime @xmath107 ; such behaviors have been seen in lower mobility samples @xcite . </S>",
