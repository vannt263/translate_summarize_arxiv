    "the differential operator on the left - hand side of ( [ i1 ] ) generates motion with a constant acceleration @xmath10 .",
    "the accelerated motion is permanently perturbed by instantaneous exchanges of velocities with thermalized bath particles .",
    "this is modeled by the boltzmann collision term on the right hand side of equation ( [ i1 ] ) , which accounts for elastic encounters between equal mass particles .",
    "the collision frequency depends therein on the absolute relative velocity @xmath11 through a simple power law with exponent @xmath12 .",
    "finally @xmath13 is some characteristic velocity of the underlying interparticle interaction .    in the case of hard rods ( @xmath14 )",
    "the factor @xmath11 is the main source of difficulties in the attemps to rigorously determine the evolution of @xmath1 , since it prevents the effective use of laplace and fourier transformations .",
    "it was thus quite remarkable that a stationary velocity distribution could be analytically determined in that case , leading in particular to an explicit expression for the current at any value of the external acceleration @xcite . in that case ,",

    "also , when @xmath8 is replaced by the distribution @xmath16/2 $ ] with a discrete velocity spectrum @xmath17 , an explicit analytic solution has been derived and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the physically relevant conclusions from those works can be summarized as follows    * the approach to the asymptotic stationary velocity distribution is exponentially fast * in the reference system moving with average velocity , the hydrodynamic diffusion mode governs the spreading of the distribution in position space * the green - kubo autocorrelation formula for the diffusion coefficient applies in the non - equilibrium steady state    our aim is to show that the general features ( i)-(iii ) persist when @xmath8 is the maxwell distribution with temperature @xmath18 .",

    "this allows us to simplify the resolution of the kinetic equation . owing to this fact ,",
    "the very hard particle model , similarly to the maxwell gas , has been studied in numerous works ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite , and references given therein )",

    "for instance , the large - velocity behaviour of @xmath49 is identical to the equilibrium gaussian for very hard particles , while it takes an exponential form in the maxwell gas . also , the average current @xmath202 increases more slowly when @xmath184 for very hard particles , and the corresponding relaxation time @xmath264 vanishes instead of remaining constant for the maxwell gas .    among the above phenomena",

    "therefore , beyond the previous cancellation , it seems that the large number of collisions for @xmath116 shrink equilibrium fluctuations . on the contrary , for @xmath310 ,",
    "since @xmath77 diverges when @xmath184 , the residual effect of collisions in the reference frame seems to vanish and particles tend to behave as if they were free .",
    "we expect that the same qualitative picture should be valid in the hard rod case which corresponds to the intermediate value @xmath14 of the exponent @xmath12 in equation ( [ i1 ] ) .",
    "the quantitative behaviours should interpolate between those described for @xmath310 and @xmath116 .",
    "for instance , the stationary distribution @xmath49 computed in ref .",
    "@xcite displays a large - velocity asymptotic behaviour which is indeed intermediary between those derived here for @xmath310 and @xmath116 . also , the average current @xmath311 is of order @xmath312 for @xmath25 large , which lies between the @xmath25- and @xmath201-behaviours found for @xmath310 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "notice that the @xmath201-behaviour for @xmath116 can be retrieved within a selfconsistent argument , which uses in an essential way the existence of the velocity scale related to the particle - particle interaction .",
