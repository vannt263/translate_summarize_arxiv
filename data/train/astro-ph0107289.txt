    "the nowadays popular expression `` starburst - agn connection '' was to our knowledge first coined by tim heckman in a 1991 conference paper which dealt primarily with the then hot debate over the starburst model for agn of roberto terlevich and collaborators .",
    "since then , several groups have gathered unambiguous evidence that vigorous star - formation occurs in the inner few hundred pc of many agns ( see cid fernandes  2001a and references therein ) , flooding agn papers with considerations about the effects of starbursts .",
    "this very volume contains several new reports of nuclei exhibiting both starburst and agn properties ( e.g.  colina , levenson ) and of ways of diagnosing such _ composite",
    "_ systems ( e.g.  kohno ) .",
    "while these discoveries undoubtedly strengthen the long held suspicion that these two phenomena are intertwined in some fundamental way , in all fairness , we still do not know what this connection actually means ! in a way , the situation was perhaps clearer 510 years ago , when the discussion was polarized in terms of the pros and cons of the starburst model for agn , a central theme of the la palma meeting back in 1993 ( tenorio - tagle 1994 ) .",
    "now that the focus has ( ironically ) drifted away from that debate ( because of the overwhelming evidence that super - massive black - holes do exist , gathered since we last meet here in `` la isla bonita '' ) , there is not a well defined theoretical framework able to make good use of these new data . now that we all recognize that the issue is not starburst _ or _ black - hole",
    ", the fundamental questions are ( 1 ) what role do starbursts play in defining the observed properties of agn , and ( 2 ) what is the physics linking starbursts and agn ?    the kind of starburst - agn connection which would do more justice to the term `` connection '' is one in which circum - nuclear star - formation somehow controls the accretion rate and/or vice - versa , via symbiotic / feedback processes , perhaps on the lines of the old models by perry & dyson ( 1985 ) and norman & scoville ( 1988 ) .",
    "a more trivial and less causal connection would be one that links starbursts and agns by their common eating habits .",
    "both starbursts and black - holes live on gas , so feeding the inner regions of galaxies ( by the dynamical processes discussed in this meeting ) may well lead to a simple genetic link between star - formation and nuclear activity , with either phenomenon proceeding essentially unaware of the concomitant occurrence of the other .",
    "these two extreme alternatives , which broadly outline `` nurture or nature '' perspectives on the starburst - agn connection , respectively , are presently viable . by the time we next gather in la palma we will surely have a clearer understanding of which of them is more relevant .",
    "observational clues on the nature of the starburst - agn connection require the careful study of systems in which both phenomena co - exist .",
    "a critical first step is hence to devise ways of identifying such composite starburst+agn nuclei .",
    "a second step is to characterize the basic parameters of both the starburst ( e.g. , its star - formation rate ) and the agn ( say , its accretion rate ) , preferably for as large a number of systems as possible , so that one can address issues such as evolutionary effects , correlations between the starburst and agn properties , the frequency of starbursts in agns and the role of the host galaxy ( see storchi - bergmann s contribution elsewhere in this volume ) .",
    "in these few pages we summarize some of our results concerning the first step , i.e. , the diagnosis of compositeness .",
    "our major `` publicity '' goal here is to convince the reader that we found relatively cheap ways of identifying composite systems and to encourage her / him to apply them to her / his data sets .",
    "we predict that such applications will substantially enlarge the current database of composite systems , thus providing plenty of raw material for more detailed studies , necessary to further our understanding of the starburst - agn connection .",
    "agns are so complex and interesting by themselves that agn - auts have traditionally been reluctant to meddle in the business of stellar populations .",
    "the sentence `` removing the starlight contribution '' , present in so many papers since the late 70 s , epitomizes the historical view of stellar populations as an annoying pollution of agn spectra .",
    "most of the recent advances in the topic of the starburst - agn connection stem from works which break this barrier by daring to dissect this `` pollution '' , using it to characterize the stellar content within the central kpc of active galaxies .",
    "this lead to an outbreak of discoveries of starbursts around agn , predominantly seyfert 2 s , where the nuclear light - house is conveniently blocked from view , facilitating the study of circum - nuclear stellar populations .",
    "for instance , stellar wind lines in the uv , the wr bump and/or high order balmer absorption lines , all signatures of recent or ongoing star - formation , were detected in 15 out of 35 seyfert 2 s in our combined northern ( heckman  1997 ; gonzalez delgado , heckman , & leitherer 2001 ) and southern ( cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann , & schmitt 1998 ; storchi bergmann , cid fernandes , & schmitt 1998 ; storchi - bergmann  2000 ) samples . identifying these finger - prints of starbursts required high s / n data and years of hard work .",
    "but _ can we make it simpler ?",
    "_ in other words , can we use these data to figure out a less expensive way of identifying composite starburst+seyfert 2 systems ?",
    "the answer is _ yes _ !",
    "this answer was reached from an apparently hopeless method .",
    "we simply feed the population synthesis code of cid fernandes  ( 2001b ; see also schmitt , storchi - bergmann , & cid fernandes 1999 and leo  in this volume ) with the equivalent widths of ca k , cn and the g - band absorption features , plus a couple of near - uv colors ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "very few observables to solve an acknowledgedly difficult problem ( population synthesis ) , which , despite its `` long and venerable history '' ( worthey 1994 ) , has something of a `` bad reputation '' ( searle 1986 ) .",
    "sure enough , we were not able to achieve a detailed description of the stellar populations in terms of all age and metallicity - related parameters in the code with so little information",
    ". however , we achieved excellent results by reducing the dimensionality of the problem to just 3 components : @xmath2 , which is the total fraction of light due to stars of @xmath3 yr or more , @xmath4 , the fraction due to @xmath5 yr ( post - starburst ) populations , and @xmath6 , which congregates all stellar generations of age @xmath7 yr plus a power - law featureless continuum ( fc ) , included to account for scattered light .",
    "while it is generally difficult to decide whether young stars or a genuine agn fc dominate this last component ( a historic problem which is still unsolved  see storchi bergmann  2000 ) , in practice the strongest fc s are found in composites , for which young stars clearly dominate @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath8-components , which we chose to normalize at the 4861 continuum , must add up to 100% , thus defining a plane in ( @xmath2,@xmath4,@xmath6)-space , so in practice the method provides a _ bi - parametric _ semi - empirical description of the data .    the results of this exercise are shown in fig .",
    "1a , where the synthetic proportions are projected in the @xmath6-@xmath4 plane .",
    "our 15 certified composite systems are plotted as filled circles , whereas `` boring '' seyfert 2 s ( those where we have not detected signatures of circum - nuclear starburst activity ) are shown as empty circles . regardless of the actual meaning of the synthesis analysis , even the most skeptical reader must agree that the method provides an excellent empirical tool to separate composite from boring seyfert 2 s ! _ all _ composites but _ only one _ `` pure '' seyfert 2 ( ngc 1068 , affected by its uniquely strong scattered light component ) have @xmath9 and thus @xmath10 , a threshold which can be equally well expressed by @xmath11  . also , _ all _ @xmath12 sources are composites . a remarkable fact about this diagram is that it does _ not _ use any of the information which was used to classify systems as composite ( uv lines , the wr bump and/or high order balmer lines ) .",
    "the synthesis picks out the composites simply by their diluted metal absorption bands and blue colors .",
    "as these data are relatively easy to obtain ( all you need is a s / n @xmath13 optical spectrum ) , the method can be readily applied to large data sets , offering a cheap way to find many more composites .",
    "we have in fact verified that the method works for other samples , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b ( see cid fernandes  2001a for details and for other handy properties of the synthesis parameters ) .",
    "another remarkable fact about fig .",
    "1 is that our seemingly crude synthesis yields a good description of the _ evolutionary status _ of the circum - nuclear starbursts in composites .",
    "the youngest composites ( those which exhibit o and/or wr star features , such as mrk 477 ) are located in the bottom - right part of the plot ( large @xmath14 ) whereas systems in a post - starburst phase ( with pronounced high order balmer absorption lines , such as eso 362-g8 ) populate the top - left region , and nuclei which exhibit both characteristics ( e.g. , ngc 5135 , ngc 7130 ) are located in between ( top - right ) .",
    "the bottom - line here is that , more than a necessary evil , betting on a simple population synthesis analysis of seyfert 2 s was not a bad idea after all !    the evolutionary path of a starburst in fig .  1",
    "would roughly follow a @xmath15 sequence as the burst ages and fades , converging to bottom - left of the plot , i.e. , the region populated by `` boring '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "this naturally suggests that `` boring '' seyfert 2 s are the end point of composites ! it must be stressed , however , that ( at least some ) `` boring '' seyfert 2 s may well have faint but not necessarily old starbursts , which are naturally harder to detect against the dominant background of old bulge stars ( quantified by their large @xmath2 ) .",
    "in fact , we came to recognize that we know much less about the `` boring '' seyfert 2 s than about the composite ones , which , somewhat paradoxically , makes `` boring '' seyfert 2 s more interesting ! despite such caveats",
    ", such an evolutionary scenario seems compelling .",
    "among the many interesting systematic differences we found between composite and `` boring '' seyfert 2 s is that the former are significantly _ more luminous _ than the latter .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , where we see that composites are typically @xmath16 times more luminous in terms of their far ir emission than `` boring '' seyfert 2 s .",
    "a more dramatic way of putting it is that above @xmath17 l@xmath18 , @xmath19 of seyfert 2 s in our sample are composites .",
    "luminous seyfert 2 s may therefore owe much of their luminosity output to circum - nuclear star - formation .",
    "composites are also more luminous in the optical continuum and emission lines , a difference which is only exacerbated when reddening corrections are applied , since composites are also more optically extincted than `` boring '' seyfert 2 s , consistent with the x - ray analysis of levenson , heckman & weaver ( 2001 ) .",
    "intuitively , one expects younger things to be more luminous , so this tendency fits well in the evolutionary scenario outlined by the ( luminosity - independent ) synthesis analysis .",
    "we also find that `` boring '' seyfert 2 s are weaker both in indices sensitive to starburst ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and agn ( @xmath22}$ ] ) activity , indicating that more luminous agn host correspondingly more luminous circum - nuclear starbursts ! a more refined analysis may eventually translate this finding into something like a `` star formation rate @xmath23 accretion rate '' relation .",
    "in our full comparative study of the properties of composite and `` boring '' seyfert 2 s ( which includes the analysis of reference samples of starburst , active , merging and normal galaxies ) , we further identify the effects of circum - nuclear starbursts upon emission line equivalent widths , gas excitation indices , line profiles , near - uv surface brightness and central morphology .",
    "whilst we still lack a clear understanding of whether circum - nuclear starbursts are indeed an integral part of the agn phenomenon , there remains no doubt that they exist and play a major role in defining observable properties traditionally attributed solely to agn .",
    "like it or not , theorists have to deal with this fact .",
    "for instance , we find that typically 50% ( and up to 80% ) of the nuclear h@xmath24 luminosity of composites is powered by massive stars ! at the very least , this calls for a revision of classical photoionization models , which must mix a starburst and a harder ionizing source when modeling nuclear emission lines in seyfert 2 s .",
    "less starburst - phobic readers will see these results as further signals of a truly physical connection between star - formation and nuclear activity . establishing how fundamental this connection is will require the extension of diagnostics such as the ones presented here to larger samples of seyfert 2 s in order to derive statistically robust results , as well as a more panoramic view of starbursts in agns as a whole , from liners to qsos .",
    "slowly , but surely , we are putting together the pieces of this puzzle ."
