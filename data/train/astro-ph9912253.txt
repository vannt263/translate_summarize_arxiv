    "the calculation of accurate collision strengths for atomic transitions has been a long standing problem in the field of quantitative spectroscopy .",
    "any calculation involving atoms in non - lte conditions requires the knowledge of vast numbers of collision strengths in order to make these calculations realistic and accurate . until recently the computing power was simply not available to calculate collision strengths in a systematic way .",
    "one either had to resort to simpler and more approximate methods or one had to limit the calculations to only the most important transitions .",
    "this situation has now changed with the start of the iron project ( hummer et al .",
    "1993 ) , which aims to produce a large database of accurately calculated collision strengths .",
    "the collision strength for an atomic transition depends + strongly on the energy of the colliding electron and shows many resonances ( e.g. , aggarwal 1984 ) .",
    "such resonances occur when the total energy of the target ion and the colliding electron correspond to an auto - ionizing state . in order to calculate these resonances accurately ,",
    "a fine grid of energy points is necessary .",
    "this is a type of problem for which r - matrix methods are very well suited .",
    "however , a source of uncertainty in these calculations is that the energies of most auto - ionizing states have not been measured in the laboratory and therefore need to be derived from calculations .",
    "it is a well known fact that the resulting energies are not very accurate and hence the positions of the resonances are also uncertain . since the collision strengths are usually folded with a maxwellian energy distribution , this is not a major problem for high temperature ( i.e. , x - ray ) plasmas where the distribution is much broader than the uncertainty in the position of the resonances .",
    "however , for low temperature ( e.g. , photo - ionized ) plasmas this can lead to problems if a resonance is present near the threshold energy for the transition .",
    "if only the high - energy tail of the maxwellian distribution is capable of inducing a collisional transition , then a small shift in the position of a near - threshold resonance can have a severe impact on the effective collision strength .",
    "this effect would be even more pronounced if the resonance shifts below the transition threshold and disappears completely .",
    ".comparison of various determinations of the effective collision strengths for transitions within the ground term of .",
    "the values are for @xmath1 = 10000  k. [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      this is the nebula studied by o96 . the [ nev ] temperature and density for this nebula were already derived from the sws06 spectrum by pottasch & beintema ( 1999 ) . in our analysis",
    "we will include the sws014 spectrum as well .",
    "the expected values for the electron temperature and density are those of o96 .",
    "our analysis gives a result which deviates slightly more than 1  @xmath2 from these values .",
    "the preferred temperature of o96 is based on various determinations using ions with lower ionization potentials than . in view of the discussion in the previous section concerning temperature stratification ,",
    "this estimate is probably too low . especially in view of the temperatures derived by o96 from rather low excitation line ratios like [ siii ] , [ ariii ] and [ oiii ] which range between 18100  k and 19400  k",
    ", the [ nev ] temperature may be expected to be considerably higher than 19000  k. a temperature of 22000  k is more realistic ( see the discussion in pottasch & beintema 1999 ) .",
    "this value for the temperature is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ nev : fig ] . after this correction",
    "the discrepancy is slightly less than 1  @xmath2 .",
    "this is the nebula studied by c87 .",
    "the intensity for the [ nev ] 342.6  nm line is in doubt . c87",
    "quote @xmath3 , but it is not clear how this value was obtained .",
    "we decided to use the value quoted in aller & faulkner ( @xcite ) instead . from the discussion in that article it is not clear whether the data were corrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "the intensities they quote for other strong blue emission lines compare well with the dereddened intensities given by c87 and we therefore assume that the aller & faulkner ( @xcite ) data are corrected for interstellar extinction . they give @xmath4 .",
    "the correction for the blend with the oiii 342.9  nm and 344.4  nm bowen resonance - fluorescence lines is easy , since the oiii 313.3  nm line has been measured by c87 .",
    "the oiii 313.3  nm , 342.9  nm and 344.4  nm lines all originate from the same upper level ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) and the intensity ratio of the lines is simply given by the ratio of the transition probabilities times the photon energy .",
    "using opacity project data ( luo et al.1989 ) one finds @xmath7  : @xmath8  : @xmath9  = 10.94  : 1.00  : 2.94 .",
    "c87 gives @xmath10 .",
    "hence @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this result is substantially lower than the value used by c87 .",
    "we were not able to correct the _ sws _",
    "spectrum accurately for aperture effects and therefore preferred to use the _ lrs _  flux for the [ nev ] 14.32  @xmath0 m  line . to complete the data",
    "set , we assumed a value for the 24.32  @xmath0 m  flux such that the resulting density agreed with the expected value .",
    "none of the flux values we adopted for this nebula can be considered accurate and re - measurement is warranted .",
    "the expected values for the electron temperature and density were determined by averaging the data in table  12 of c87 . for the temperature we only used the values derived from the [ arv ] , [ neiv ] and [ nev ] line ratios , for the density we used all values except those derived from [ mgi ] , [ niv ] and [ oiv ] lines .",
    "one can see that there is a slightly more than 2  @xmath2 discrepancy for the electron temperature .",
    "again the expected value for the electron temperature may be underestimated due to temperature stratification .",
    "we think 15000  k is in all probability a more realistic , though still conservative , estimate .",
    "this value for the temperature is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ nev : fig ] . after this correction",
    "there is a 1.5  @xmath2 discrepancy .",
    "a major advance in atomic theory in the past decade has been close coupling calculations that include resonances .",
    "these new calculations ( carried out with an r - matrix code ) can raise the collision strength by an order of magnitude or more compared to older calculations .",
    "these large differences have led to a discussion of the validity of these calculations .",
    "nebulae offer powerful laboratories for verifying atomic processes , and two studies ( c87 and o96 ) used this approach to test the r - matrix calculations for .",
    "they found that spectra of planetary nebulae did not agree with the r - matrix results .",
    "this casted doubt on the validity of the close coupling calculations .    in this paper",
    "we have redone the analysis carried out by c87 and o96 using newer , more accurate data .",
    "we also included the well studied nebula ngc  7027 in the analysis to obtain a larger sample .",
    "we found that the expected values of the electron temperature and density all were within 3  @xmath2 of our results .",
    "hence there is no proof for significant problems with the r - matrix calculations . on closer inspection",
    "one sees that the largest discrepancy is for ngc  7027 , the best studied nebula .",
    "also the electron temperature derived from our analysis is systematically higher than the expectation value for all nebulae .",
    "this could point to inaccuracies in the collision strengths . to check this point further ,",
    "we have re - analyzed our sample using effective collision strengths which were lowered by 30  % for transitions within the @xmath13 ground term .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ nev : fig ] .",
    "they are in good agreement with the expected values . hence the r - matrix calculations for could be off by 30  % , but certainly not more .",
    "we point out that this is significantly less than the factor @xmath142.7 suggested by o96 .",
    "an alternative explanation could be that the [ nev ] 342.6  nm fluxes are systematically overestimated due to a problem with the extinction curve , or a combination of the two effects .      1 .",
    "the discrepancies found by c87 can be explained by the inaccuracy of the [ nev ] 342.6  nm flux they adopted .",
    "the discrepancies found by o96 mainly stem from the inaccuracy of the _ lrs _  measurement of the [ nev ] 14.32  @xmath0 m  line",
    ". 2 .   based on the data presented in this paper",
    "there is _ no reason _ to assume that there are any problems with the collision strengths for calculated by lennon & burke ( 1994 ) .",
    "our analysis has shown that the data are accurate at the 30  % level or better .",
    "this confirms the validity of close coupling calculations .",
