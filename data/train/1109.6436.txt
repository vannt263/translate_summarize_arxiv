    "electrons are identified at mid - rapidity using the information provided by the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the transition radiation detector ( trd ) , and the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "the time - of - flight of the individual particles is required to be consistent with the electron hypothesis . using the trd information ,",
    "an electron likelihood is computed from the energy deposited in the 6 detector layers by charged particles . in order to provide a good e/@xmath1 separation ,",
    "tracks are required to have at least 5 out of maximum 6 chambers providing information on the energy deposit .",
    "a cut providing an electron selection efficiency of 80% is applied to the likelihood value .",
    "finally , we consider the tpc energy loss d@xmath2/d@xmath3 expressed as deviation from the bethe - bloch electron curve and select electron candidates from the top half of the d@xmath2/d@xmath3 distribution , to guarantee very high electron purity .",
    "inclusive electron spectra are based on high - quality tracks passing the particle identification criteria over a momentum range where the hadron contamination does not exceed 10% . in the pp analysis",
    "all three detectors were used to identify electrons and the spectra extend up to 10 gev/@xmath4 in transverse momentum @xmath5 . in the pb ",
    "pb analysis only the tof and tpc information were used and the spectra extend up to 6 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the remaining hadron contamination is estimated by fitting the electron and the hadron tpc d@xmath2/d@xmath3 gaussian distributions in narrow momentum slices and counting the hadrons passing the pid cut .",
    "this contribution is subtracted .",
    "the electron yield is corrected for acceptance and for the efficiency of the selection criteria , using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "an unfolding procedure is applied to correct for the distortion of the @xmath5 distribution due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "the inclusive electron spectrum contains contributions from many sources other than heavy - flavour hadron decays .",
    "the most important are : dalitz decays of light - flavour neutral mesons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 ) , photon conversions in the beam pipe and in the detector material , di - electron decays of vector mesons ( @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , heavy quarkonia , real and virtual qcd photons . the spectrum composed of these background electrons",
    "is described by the so - called electron cocktail , calculated on the basis of meson spectra measured with the alice detector , as described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "further components are parametrized according to other measurements at the lhc ( e.g. quarkonia ) or theoretical predictions ( e.g. qcd photons ) . in this analysis",
    ", the statistical subtraction of the cocktail from the inclusive electron spectrum provides the transverse momentum distribution of electrons from heavy - flavour hadron decays .",
    "a sample of minimum bias pp collisions ( 2.6 nb@xmath11 ) recorded by alice in summer 2010 at @xmath0=7  tev was used to measure the production cross section of electrons from heavy - flavour decays according to the method discussed above .",
    "the measured spectrum , including both the charm and the beauty contributions , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] on the left .",
    "the present conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty is @xmath1220% on the measured spectrum and @xmath1210% on the electron cocktail .",
    "the measured cross section is compared to a prediction at fixed - order plus next - to - leading logarithms ( fonll ) @xcite which provides a good description .",
    "= 7  tev.,title=\"fig : \" ] = 7  tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the silicon inner tracking system ( its ) provides excellent impact parameter resolution allowing for isolation of decay products of longer living particles .",
    "electrons from the decay of hadrons with beauty content are selected by requiring large displacement from the interaction vertex .",
    "the impact parameter resolution is well described in our simulations .",
    "a selection is applied by requiring the electron to miss the interaction vertex by at least three times the error on the separation of the track from the vertex ( of the order of 80  @xmath13 m at 2 gev/@xmath4 ) .",
    "the remaining contribution from charm decays is estimated from the d meson cross section at mid - rapidity , and subtracted .",
    "the resulting spectrum of electrons from beauty decays is shown in fig.[fig1 ] on the right , also compared to the fonll prediction for the beauty component .",
    "this is the first beauty production cross section measurement in alice .",
    "a similar analysis is performed with pb ",
    "pb collisions recorded by alice in november and december 2010 .",
    "electrons are identified with the tof and tpc detectors and inclusive electron spectra are obtained in 6 different centrality bins .",
    "the hadron contamination in the electron sample remains below 10% in the momentum range between 1.5 and 6 gev/@xmath4 , to which this first measurement is restricted .",
    "the inclusive electron spectra are corrected for acceptance and efficiencies using a hijing monte - carlo sample enriched with heavy - flavour signals .",
    "an electron cocktail for each centrality bin is calculated based on the charged pion spectra measured by alice . in the pb ",
    "pb analysis the systematic uncertainties currently are large : of the order of 35% on the inclusive spectra and 25% on the cocktails . when comparing the inclusive electron spectra with those generated using the cocktail prescription ( see fig . 2 and 3 in @xcite , where more details are discussed ) ,",
    "a hint for an excess is observed in the electron yield in the transverse momentum region between 1.5 and @xmath123.5 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the excess ( indicated by the ratio in fig .",
    "3 in @xcite , significantly larger than in pp collisions , despite the large systematic uncertainties ) exhibits a clear centrality dependence .",
    "cross checks with the alice measurement of d mesons at mid - rapidity seem to exclude an additional charm source .",
    "the possibility of a contribution from thermal radiation , already measured at rhic @xcite , will be further investigated .",
    "we compute the nuclear modification factor @xmath15 defined as @xmath16 , where is the average nuclear overlap function for a given centrality bin , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe the electron yield in pb  pb and in pp collisions .    0.5     the latter is obtained by extrapolating the measured spectrum at @xmath0=7  tev down to the energy of 2.76  tev according to fonll prescriptions @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath15 for the cocktail subtracted electrons in the 0 - 10% most central events is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the transverse momentum region between 3.5 and 6 gev/@xmath4 ,",
    "in which we assume that the cocktail - subtracted electron spectra are dominated by electrons from heavy - flavour decays , a suppression by a factor 1.5 - 4 is observed .",
    "this is similar to the suppression measured with single muons at forward rapidity @xcite .",
    "this measurement is compatible with in - medium energy loss of the heavy - flavour quarks .",
    "the measurement of electron spectra at mid - rapidity in alice allows to determine the production cross section of electrons from heavy - flavour decays in pp collisions at @xmath0=7  tev .",
    "the first measurement of beauty hadron decays was presented .",
    "fonll predictions provide a good description of the measured spectra . together with the electron spectra measured in pb ",
    "pb collisions , a nuclear modification factor is extracted , showing a strong suppression of electrons from heavy - flavour decays in central collisions .",
    "the next goal is to measure the suppression factor for electrons from charm and beauty hadrons separately , to provide constraints to in - medium energy loss models .",
