    "i am greatly honored to be able to participate in this conference celebrating prof .",
    "yang s 85th birthday .",
    "we wish prof .",
    "yang a very happy birthday , and many more to come .    in this talk",
    "i would like to present a constructive approach to both exact and quasi - exact solvable one - dimensional schrdinger equations .",
    "everyone knows what exact solvability means .",
    "it is fair to say that all of us learned the principles of quantum mechanics through several well - known exactly solvable ( es ) models , such as the infinite square well , the harmonic oscillator , the hydrogen atom , etc .",
    "but in actual life , exactly solvable systems are hard to come by .",
    "most systems one encounters are non - solvable , and one has to adopt various approximation schemes to solve them .",
    "two decades ago , a new class of potentials which are intermediate to es potentials and non solvable ones have been found for the schrdinger equation . these are called quasi - exactly solvable ( qes ) models for which it is possible to determine algebraically a part of the spectrum but not the whole spectrum @xcite .",
    "the simplest qes model first discovered is the sextic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the discovery of this class of spectral problems has greatly enlarged the number of physical systems which we can study analytically .    here",
    "i would like to discuss a novel approach that treats both es and qes systems on the same footing @xcite .",
    "it is based on the so - called prepotential together with the bethe ansatz equations",
    ".    since qes systems are less familiar to most people , i shall give a very brief introduction to qes theory before the prepotential approach is discussed .",
    "the essence of quasi - exact solvability is most easily explained as follows @xcite .",
    "it is well known that any hamiltonian @xmath0 can be represented as an infinite - dimensional hermitian matrix @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the elements @xmath2 depend on the choice of a complete set of orthonormal functions @xmath3 forming a basis of the hilbert space .",
    "the solution of the spectral problem then reduces to a diagonalization of matrix @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , contrary to the case of finite matrices , there is no general algebraic rules that would allow one to diagonalize the infinite - dimensional @xmath0 .    if the matrix @xmath4 is very specific so that it can be reduced to the diagonal form with the aid of an algebraic process , then the quantal system is exactly solvable .",
    "@xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the most well - known example is the harmonic oscillator .",
    "suppose a hamiltonian @xmath0 is reducible to a block form @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the block in the upper left corner is an @xmath7 hermitian matrix , and the block with asterisks is an infinite matrix with non - vanishing elements .",
    "the upper left block can be diagonalized without touching the infinite one .",
    "this means that one can determine only a part of the spectrum of @xmath0 with @xmath8 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . this system is called qes .",
    "qes models are not simply mathematical constructs . although the first and simplest example of qes model is the sextic oscillator ,",
    "physical qes systems have been found . for examples ,",
    "the system of two electrons in a three - dimensional oscillator potential @xcite , two - dimensional charged particle in coulomb and uniform magnetic fields ( the schrdinger , klein - gordon , and dirac cases are discussed in refs . , and , respectively ) , and electron on a lattice in magnetic field ( azbel - hofstadter problem ) @xcite .",
    "usually a qes problem admits a certain underlying lie algebraic symmetry which is responsible for the quasi - exact solutions .",
    "such underlying symmetry is most easily studied in the lie - algebraic approach @xcite .",
    "the essence of this approach is as follows .",
    "consider a schrdinger equation @xmath9 with hamiltonian @xmath10 and wave function @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 belongs either to the interval @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "now suppose we make an  imaginary gauge transformation \" on the function @xmath15 : @xmath16 . for physical systems which we are interested in",
    ", the phase factor @xmath17 is responsible for the asymptotic behaviors of the wave function so as to ensure normalizability .",
    "the function @xmath18 satisfies a schrdinger equation with a gauge transformed hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "suppose @xmath20 can be written as a quadratic combination of the generators @xmath21 of some lie algebra with a finite dimensional representation , i.e. , @xmath22 where the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are usually taken to be real @xcite . then within this finite dimensional hilbert space",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath20 can be diagonalized , and therefore a finite number of eigenstates are solvable .",
    "hence the system described by @xmath0 is qes . for one - dimensional qes systems the most general lie",
    "algebra is @xmath25 .",
    "the generators @xmath21 of the @xmath25 lie algebra take the differential forms : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the variables @xmath12 and @xmath28 are related by some function . @xmath29 is the degree of the eigenfunctions @xmath30 , which are polynomials in a @xmath31-dimensional hilbert space with the basis @xmath32 .",
    "the lie - algebraic approach to qes models excels in revealing the underlying symmetry of a qes system explicitly .",
    "however , solutions of qes states are more directly found in the analytic approach based on the bethe ansatz equations @xcite . in this analytic approach the form of the wave functions containing some parameters",
    "are assumed from the very beginning , and these parameters are fitted to make the ansatz compatible with the potential under consideration .",
    "recently , a different approach to qes models has emerged @xcite . in this approach",
    "the emphasis shifts from the potential to the so - called prepotential ( or superpotential ) , a concept which plays a fundamental role in supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( we note here that the prepotential considered here is the integral of the superpotetial in refs .   and ) .",
    "prepotential has been extensively employed to study classical and quantum integrability in calogero - moser systems @xcite .",
    "the merit of this approach is that the form of the potential of the system concerned needs not be assumed from the beginning .",
    "all information about the system is contained in the prepotential and the solutions , or roots , of the bethe ansatz equations ( in terms of certain transformed coordinates ) .",
    "the prepotential and the roots determine the potential as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues simultaneously .",
    "also , in this approach exact and quasi - exact solvabilities can be treated on the same footing . furthermore",
    ", such approach facilitates extension of the qes theory from the schrdinger equation to equations for multi - component wave functions @xcite .",
    "more recently , qes theory was extended to the fokker - planck equations also via the prepotential approach @xcite .",
    "the emphasis of the works just mentioned was placed on the feasibility and elegance of the prepotential approach .",
    "but in these works the forms of the prepotential and the required change of coordinates were either directly adapted from the known es and qes models , or given as known for the new qes systems . to make the prepotential approach a satisfactory approach one must be able to determine the choice of coordinate transformation and the prepotential from the very beginning",
    "this was recently achieved for certain classes of coordinates and prepotentials @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall present the main ideas of this approach , and demonstrate how the simplest es and qes models could be easily derived .",
    "suppose @xmath33 is the ground state , with zero energy , of a hamiltonian @xmath34 : @xmath35 . by the well known oscillation theorem @xmath36",
    "is nodeless , and thus can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a regular function of @xmath12 .",
    "for the square - integrable @xmath36 , this is the simplest example of quasi - exact solvability .",
    "this implies that the potential @xmath39 is completely determined by @xmath40 : @xmath41 , and consequently , the hamiltonian is factorizable ( we adopt the unit system in which @xmath42 and the mass @xmath43 of the particle are such that @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 we shall call @xmath38 the zero - th order prepotential .",
    "consider now a wave function @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) which is related to @xmath36 of @xmath34 by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 here @xmath50 is some function of @xmath12 . in taking the form of @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ phi-2 ] ) i have assumed that the only singularities of the system are @xmath52 .",
    "other situations are discussed in ref .  .",
    "the function @xmath51 is a polynomial in an @xmath53-dimensional hilbert space with the basis @xmath54 .",
    "one can rewrite @xmath46 as @xmath55 with the @xmath56-th order prepotential @xmath57 being defined by @xmath58 operating on @xmath46 by the operator @xmath59 results in a schrdinger equation @xmath60 , where @xmath61 from eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) , @xmath62 has the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 here the prime denotes derivative w.r.t . the variable @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath66 is generally a meromorphic function of @xmath28 with at most simple poles .",
    "let us demand that the residues of the simple poles , @xmath67 , @xmath68 should all vanish .",
    "this will result in a set of algebraic equations which the parameters @xmath69 must satisfy .",
    "these equations are called the bethe ansatz equations for @xmath69 . with @xmath69 satisfying the bethe ansatz equations",
    ", @xmath66 will have no simple poles at @xmath69 but it still generally depends on @xmath69 .",
    "thus the form of @xmath62 is determined by the choice of @xmath70 and @xmath38 .    in what follows",
    "we would like to demonstrate that the choice of @xmath70 and @xmath71 determine the nature of solvability of the quantal system .",
    "we shall restrict our consideration only to those cases where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are polynomials in @xmath28 of degree @xmath43 , @xmath29 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are not independent .",
    "in fact , from @xmath78 we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 consequently , the variables @xmath12 and @xmath28 are related by ( we assume @xmath81 is invertible for practical purposes ) @xmath82 and the prepotential @xmath38 is determined as @xmath83 eqs .",
    "( [ z(x ) ] ) and ( [ w0 ] ) define the transformation @xmath81 and the corresponding prepotential @xmath38 .",
    "thus , @xmath84 and @xmath76 determine the quantum system .",
    "of course , the choice of @xmath85 and @xmath86 must be such that @xmath40 derived from ( [ w0 ] ) must ensure normalizability of @xmath87 .",
    "now depending on the degrees of the polynomials @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we have the following situations :    1 .",
    "if @xmath88 , then in @xmath89 the parameter @xmath56 and the roots @xmath90 s will only appear as an additive constant and not in any term involving powers of @xmath28 .",
    "such system is then exactly solvable ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath91 , then @xmath56 will appear in the first power term in @xmath28 , but @xmath90 s only in an additive term .",
    "this system then belongs to the so - called type 1 qes system defined in ref .",
    ", i.e. , for each @xmath47 , @xmath62 admits @xmath8 solvable states with the eigenvalues being given by the @xmath8 sets of roots @xmath90 s .",
    "this is the main type of qes systems considered in the literature ; 3 .   if @xmath92 , then not only @xmath56 but also @xmath90 s will appear in terms involving powers of @xmath28",
    "this means that for each @xmath47 , there are @xmath8 different potentials @xmath62 , differing in several parameters in terms involving powers of @xmath28 , have the same eigenvalue ( when the additive constant , or the zero point , is appropriately adjusted ) .",
    "when @xmath90 s appear only in the first power term in @xmath28 , such systems are called type 2 qes systems in ref .  .",
    "we see that qes models of higher types are possible .",
    "these general situations are considered for cases where @xmath93 are quadratic in @xmath28 ( this includes @xmath94 and @xmath95 as special cases if some of the coefficients vanish ) in ref .  .",
    "this choice of @xmath70 covers most of the known es shape - invariant potentials in ref .   and the @xmath25-based qes systems in ref .  , and a new one discussed in refs .   and",
    "such coordinates are called  sinusoidal coordinates \" , which include quadratic polynomials , trigonometric , hyperbolic , and exponential types .",
    "the connection of sinusoidal coordinates with es theory has been extensively discussed in ref .  .",
    "for simplicity , in this talk i shall only discuss cases in which @xmath70 is linear in @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are real constants .    with this choice of @xmath70 , we have @xmath99 in deriving eq .",
    "( [ dv1 ] ) use has been made of the following identities : @xmath100 demanding the residues at @xmath90 s vanish gives the set of bethe ansatz equations @xmath101 putting back the set of roots @xmath90 into eq .",
    "( [ dv1 ] ) , we obtain a potential @xmath89 without simple poles .",
    "the degree of @xmath84 determines the nature of the solvability of the system , namely , for @xmath102 , the system is , respectively , es , type 1 qes , type 2 qes , and higher types qes , as discussed generally in the last section .    to proceed further",
    ", we must specify @xmath84 .",
    "below i shall discuss cases with @xmath103 , i.e. , only es and type 1 qes models .",
    "let us take @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , where @xmath106 are real constants .",
    "this implies @xmath107 .",
    "hence , the general solution of @xmath81 is a quadratic form of @xmath12 : @xmath108 it is easily checked that @xmath98 is related to @xmath109 and @xmath110 through @xmath111 .",
    "we now show how some es and qes models can be constructed in the prepotential approach by taking different values of @xmath43 .",
    "suppose @xmath112 so that @xmath113 ( @xmath114 real ) . by writing @xmath115 ,",
    "one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ dv1 ] ) that @xmath116 the last term in braces in eq .",
    "( [ dv - case1 ] ) vanishes when @xmath90 s satisfy the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bae ] ) .",
    "now @xmath56 only appears as a parameter in an additive term , and not in terms involving powers of @xmath28 in @xmath66 .",
    "the roots @xmath90 s do not appear at all .",
    "the additive term can be treated as the eigenvalue .",
    "the schrdinger equation reads @xmath117 we see that the potential @xmath118 is es : by varying @xmath56 , one obtains all the eigenvalues @xmath119 and the eigenfunctions @xmath120 .    as an example , let us take @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "a particular solution of @xmath28 is @xmath123 . from eq .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) one gets @xmath124 the integration constant is to be determined by normalization of the wave function . for @xmath87 to be square - integrable , one must assume @xmath125 .",
    "the bae ( [ bae ] ) are : @xmath126 and the potential is @xmath127 this leads to the schrdinger equation : @xmath128 this system is just the well - known simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "we note here that by rescaling @xmath129 , eq .",
    "( [ bae - osc ] ) will have @xmath130 .",
    "the resulted equations are the equations that determine the zeros of the hermite polynomials @xmath131 as found by stieltjes @xcite .",
    "hence we have reproduced the well known wave functions for the harmonic oscillator , namely , @xmath132 .      next we consider @xmath134 . by a similar argument",
    "we obtain @xmath135 the schrdinger can be written as @xmath136 unlike the previous case , now @xmath56 not only appears in an additive constant term but also in the term with @xmath28 , and the set of roots @xmath90 s appear in the additive term .",
    "this system is the so - called type 1 qes models .",
    "type 1 qes models classified as class vi in ref .",
    "belong to this category .",
    "a well - known example is the sextic oscillator , the simplest qes model of this type @xcite , which is termed as class vi in ref .  .",
    "in our prepotential approach , this system is defined by @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath139 , and @xmath140 here @xmath141 to ensure square - integrability of the wave function .",
    "the bae ( [ bae ] ) are : @xmath142 and the potential is @xmath143x^2 -4a\\sum_k z_k -(4n+1)b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is just the well - known qes sextic oscillator first discovered in ref .  .",
    "these two examples show how simply and directly the two most classic representatives of es and qes models are derived in the prepotential approach .",
    "other es and qes models can be constructed in a similar way .",
    "particularly , we can consider cases where @xmath144 with @xmath145 . here",
    "@xmath81 is again some sinusoidal coordinates , which include the exponential , hyperbolic and trigonometric functions . by taking appropriate @xmath84",
    ", one can reconstruct class i , ii and x qes models in ref .  , and some of the es models listed in ref .  , namely , the morse potential , the scarf i and ii potentials , and the pschl - teller potential @xcite .",
    "now we turn to a different kind of spectral problem .",
    "about ten years ago , it was noted that with properly defined boundary conditions the spectrum of the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) is real and positive @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the reality of the spectrum of this hamiltonian is a consequence of its unbroken @xmath148 symmetry .",
    "this discovery immediately sparked great interest in searching for new systems with such properties , and in understanding the reasons behind the reality of their eigenvalues ( for review , see e.g. ref .  ) .    soon after the appearance of ref .",
    ", it was found that , by allowing non - hermitian @xmath148-symmetric hamiltonians , a qes polynomial potential can be quartic in its variable @xcite . previously , it was believed the lowest - degree one - dimensional qes polynomial potential is sextic , namely , that presented in sect .  4 .",
    "now let us demonstrate how simply the hamiltonian discovered in ref .",
    "is derived in our approach if we allow @xmath84 , or equivalently @xmath38 , to be complex .",
    "we take @xmath149 ( i.e. @xmath150 ) , and @xmath151 for type 1 qes system .",
    "( [ w0 ] ) then gives @xmath152 .",
    "it is obvious that , with @xmath153 and @xmath154 real , the wave functions are not normalizable as the factor @xmath155 does not converge on the whole line . hence a qes hamiltonian with quartic polynomial potential is impossible with real coefficients in @xmath40 .",
    "what if we allow @xmath156 to be complex ? suppose we take @xmath157 and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are real .",
    "obviously @xmath155 is now square - integrable on the whole line for @xmath125 . from eqs .",
    "( [ dv1 ] ) and ( [ bae ] ) we obtain straightforwardly the type 1 qes potential @xmath161x\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\left[\\gamma^2 + \\beta+2i\\alpha\\sum_k x_k\\right ] , \\label{complex1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the bae @xmath162 @xmath62 given by eq .",
    "( [ complex1 ] ) is precisely the @xmath148-symmetric qes quartic potential obtained in ref .",
    "( in the notation of ref .  , the potential has parameters @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 ) . in ref .",
    "it was shown that this @xmath148-symmetric hamiltonian is also related to the lie - algebra @xmath167 .",
    "it is nice to see that in our prepotential approach this potential can be so simply and directly derived , without any knowledge of its underlying symmetries .",
    "the properties of this system have been fully described in ref .",
    ", so we will not attempt a full discussion of it .",
    "let us just consider the two simplest cases with @xmath168 and @xmath169 .    for @xmath168 ,",
    "the potential is just @xmath39 with only one solvable state corresponding to energy @xmath170 . for @xmath169",
    ", there are two solvable states . from eq .",
    "( [ complex1 ] ) we can take the potential to be @xmath171 with eigenvalues @xmath172 .",
    "the roots @xmath173 satisfy the bae ( [ bae - complex1 ] ) : @xmath174 .",
    "the solutions are : @xmath175 .",
    "hence we see that for @xmath176 the non - hermitian potential @xmath177 has two normalizable states with real energies @xmath178 .",
    "but if @xmath179 , the energies are complex .",
    "this is consistent with the numerical results in ref .  .",
    "for higher values of @xmath56 the analysis is more complicated and numerics are needed @xcite .",
    "we note here that the same analysis can be applied to class i and vii qes systems in ref .   to get other non - hermitian qes systems with real energies .",
    "i hope i had given you a general idea of how simple and elegant the prepotential approach to es and qes models is . in this talk",
    "i have limited myself to discussing our approach only to systems defined on the full line owing to time limitation .",
    "our approach has been extended to es and qes systems defined on half - line and on finite intervals @xcite .",
    "it can be easily extended to the construction of exactly and quasi - exactly solvable dirac , pauli @xcite , fokker - planck equations @xcite , and to quasinormal modes , which are eigen - modes with complex energies of a hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .    of course",
    ", what i have presented here is quite preliminary .",
    "our approach could be further developed .",
    "firstly , so far we have only considered cases for which @xmath71 and @xmath190 are polynomials in @xmath28 .",
    "it is interesting to consider other possibilities for these two defining functions .",
    "secondly , it is extremely interesting to see how our formalism could be extended to many - body systems , such as the renowned calogero - sutherland - moser systems .",
    "the analogues of bethe - ansatz equations for these systems are not known yet .",
    "lastly , although some non - hermitian hamiltonians can be generated in this approach by making some coefficients in @xmath84 complex , as we have shown here , a full treatment of these kind of systems usually requires one to extend the basic variable @xmath12 to the complex plane @xcite .",
    "hence a better understanding of the prepotential approach to non - hermitian hamiltonians is needed .",
    "we hope to report on our progress in these directions in the near future .",
