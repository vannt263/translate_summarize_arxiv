    "by continuing miniaturization the current electronic devices have already reached length scales of only a few tens of nanometers and , in the past few years , quantum mechanical approaches have been extensively used for the modelling of the electron transport down to molecular scale @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is a lot of interest for an efficient description of time - dependent coherent transport and examples of physical systems may include nanoscopic antennas @xcite , electron and hole transport through nanostructured interfaces with applications in photovoltaics @xcite , high frequency transistors @xcite , coherent phonon pulses in the description of transient thermal transport @xcite etc .",
    "time - dependent charge transport has been investigated in a number of studies , using different techniques .",
    "the green - keldysh formalism has been applied to transport in mesoscopic systems having external time - dependent voltages @xcite or barriers @xcite .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation was employed in the context of wave packets propagation in quantum wires with magnetic fields @xcite . more recently the time - dependent wavepacket diffusion ( tdwpd ) method was employed as an approximation to the exact stochastic schrdinger equation ( sse ) method @xcite .    in the description of the time - dependent evolution of the wavefunctions",
    "an essential ingredient is represented by the _ transparent boundary conditions _ ( tbcs ) @xcite .",
    "similar problematics is found in beam propagation in optics @xcite . as the system under direct numerical investigation is finite ,",
    "the tbcs are required in order to ensure the wave propagation over the boundaries .",
    "otherwise , the waves may be partly or completely reflected back into the region of interest , bringing a limitation regarding the maximum time scales for which the process can be investigated .",
    "these are related to the size of the scattering region , which , in turn , determines the computational cost .    in this context",
    "we employ the r - matrix method as an efficient approach to obtain the stationary scattering functions .",
    "the formalism was developed by wigner and eisenbud @xcite in the field of nuclear physics and later was employed to obtain the transport properties of mesoscopic devices @xcite .",
    "it has been further applied to describe coherent charge transport in nanotransistors @xcite , thermopower in quantum wires @xcite spin dependent transport @xcite and to investigate the effects of graded distribution of scattering centers on ballistic transport @xcite and charge localization in dendritic interfaces relevant for photovoltaic applications @xcite .",
    "here we use the advantages of this approach as a basis for solving the time - dependent problem with tbcs .",
    "furthermore , an accurate description of many electronic devices of practical interest usually require a quantum approach at small length scales ( e.g. atomistic , effective mass models ) and a classical description at macroscopic scales ( e.g. drift - diffusion type models ) , usually combined in hybrid transport models , such as the drift diffusion model ( qdd ) @xcite , the quantum corrected drift diffusion model ( qcdd ) @xcite or the schrdinger - poisson - drift - diffusion model ( spdd ) @xcite . in this context of transport model hierarchies we discuss the possibility of using the developed time - dependent framework for a local characterization of the photo - current and charge separation that occurs in the vicinity of the nanostructured interfaces of photovoltaic devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the generic model system",
    "is indicated and the general r - matrix formalism is presented , pointing out the efficiency of the method in constructing the stationary scattering wavefunctions for a relatively large set of total energies .",
    "the time dependent solutions are then determined using the eigenvectors of the open quantum system .",
    "the computational method is discussed in detail . in the following section the charge transport across nanostructured interfaces relevant for photovoltaic applications",
    "is analyzed .",

    "being solutions of the stationary schrdinger equation ( [ sch ] ) the functions @xmath47 form an orthogonal system : @xmath48 in practical calculations , we discretize the energy axis and use a finite set of energies @xmath49 .    we assume the initial quantum state of a particle is given by @xmath50 , typically , although not restricted to , a wavepacket inside the scattering region . for a time independent scattering potential , the time evolution is described by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the expansion coefficients of the initial wavefunction in the orthonormated basis made of the scattering functions .",
    "the main advantage of the r - matrix method relies on the fact that total computational cost is divided in two parts : in the first part , the solution of the wigner - eisenbud problem @xmath53 , the transversal eigenvalue problem in each lead @xmath54 and the calculation of the overlap integrals @xmath55 do not depend on the total energy @xmath10 ; in the second part , the r - matrix , the s - matrix and optionally transmission functions and scattering wavefunctions are determined for each total energy @xmath10 .",
    "usually , for moderate number of channels and a large enough basis set , the hamiltonian diagonalization performed in order to obtain the eigensystem @xmath53 represents the largest computational cost .",

    "the advantage of this method becomes particularly important when a relatively large number of transmissions and wavefunctions need to be determined . in the following",

    "assuming the origin of the coordinate system is in the middle of @xmath0 , we may choose @xmath61 , with @xmath62 and similarly for @xmath63 and @xmath64 . by a one - time diagonalization , of typical cost @xmath65 ,",

    "the number of channels @xmath68 should be large enough to include at least the open channels and an appropriate number of closed ones , to ensure the convergence of the calculations , in particular of the transmission functions . at this point",
    "one can calculate explicitly the integrals @xmath55 from eq .",
    "( [ chilnu ] ) .",
    "one should note that all these steps are energy independent .    in the second step ,",
    "the r - matrix elements for a particular total energy @xmath10 are found by simple summations , of total cost @xmath70 . as the @xmath32-matrix is diagonal , finding the matrices [ 1@xmath71rk ] from eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) is achieved by an insignificant cost of @xmath72 .",
    "the most demanding part is the computation of the inverse of the dense matrix [ 1@xmath73rk ] , which may be performed by standard lapack @xcite routines with scaling of @xmath74 .",
    "the subsequent matrix multiplication in eq .",
    "( [ smatrix ] ) and the similarity transform used to obtain the @xmath75 matrix do not exceed the computational cost of matrix inversion .",
    "these steps are performed for a number of @xmath76 total energies , so that the total cost is @xmath77 . if @xmath78 , which is a typical situation , the computational burden mostly falls on solving the wigner - eisenbud problem .",
    "one should note that for an accurate representation of the @xmath66 transversal modes , the number of channels considered in the calculations should be significantly smaller than the number of basis elements used for diagonalizing the leads hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ sch_perp ] ) .",
    "the total cost of finding the transmission functions is @xmath79 and one can easily see that the cost of energy dependent part becomes comparable to the wigner - eisenbud problem only if the transmissions are computed for a large number of total energies , making the procedure effective in providing rapid varying transmission functions .",
    "one should point out that the r - matrix method provides the set of scattering functions @xmath80 of the open quantum system , which are continuous over the entire interval , leads and scattering region .",
    "one advantage of our method is the possibility of including potential barriers at the lead / scattering region interfaces , of arbitrary height , and therefore to tune the contacts to the leads from fully transparent for electrons ( or reflectionless ) with no barrier , to almost opaque with high barriers .",
    "an even bigger advantage is the fully transparent case itself , which practically describes an infinite system with a finite hamiltonian matrix in the scattering region and asymptotic wave functions outside .",
    "alternatively , a large system can in principle be described as a finite , closed system , in a basis of wave functions vanishing at the boundaries .",
    "but for practical calculations the size of the basis must increase with the size of the system , eventually becoming prohibitive .",
    "therefore , for given physical parameters and simulation time our method is more efficient .",
    "while the solution of the wigner - eisenbud problem represents usually the most demanding part , the presence of the leads generates only a minimal additional computational effort .",
    "nanostructured inhomogeneous interfaces increase the light scattering and the device active area in photovoltaic applications , enhancing the generation of photoexcited carriers .",
    "the size of the inhomogeneities should be comparable with the light wavelength , i.e. hundreds of nanometers .",
    "different techniques have been used to achieve this goal , e.g. by using nanowire arrays or mesoporous materials .",

    "given the quite different length scales involved in the physical structures of interest and the operation conditions , hybrid ( quantum - classical ) transport models should be used : at a few nanometer length scales , e.g. at the nanocrystallite scale , a quantum mechanical transport model should be best suited , while at the aggregate level and larger scales a drift - diffusion model should be employed .",

    "the shapes of the interfaces introduce different consequences in the wavepacket scattering .",
    "for example , the zig - zag interface tends to scatter significantly the wavepacket in the transversal direction , decreasing the kinetic energy on the @xmath114 direction such that the propagation along the leads is slow .",
    "by contrast , in the case of the mesoporous interface , the largest nanoparticle is the primary scatterer and the scattered wave is more uniform . in this case",
    "the partially transmitted and reflected waves are moving away from the interface at a higher speed compared to the zig - zag interface , but some probability remains confined for a longer time at the mesoporous interface .",

    "our aim here is not to fully describe the current collected at the contacts as it may depend on other parameters , like e.g. recombination rates , but to describe the electron - hole separation at the nanostructured interface . beyond @xmath121",
    "the carriers may suffer inelastic scattering processes and , at even larger time scales , they diffuse towards the contacts moving through the bulk of the two materials , a process which may be further described by a classical drift - diffusion model .    in order to quantify the charge separation , we isolate the interface region @xmath122 between positions @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the outer regions @xmath125 and @xmath126 , correspond to the two materials which make up the junction , as depicted in fig .",

    "@xmath144 decreases , while @xmath145 and @xmath146 increase in time and tend to saturate .",
    "the increase of @xmath145 is delayed compared with @xmath146 as the wave packet moves from left to right and gets scattered at the interface . by comparison , keeping the same parameters , the zig - zag interface introduces larger delays compared with the flat one .",
    "this interface transfers part of the kinetic energy , initially on the @xmath114 direction , onto the @xmath147 direction , leading to a slower advance speed .",
    "in contrast , the scattering across the mesoporous interface overall resembles better the data obtained for the flat interface , with one difference : @xmath144 decays slightly slower .",

    "in addition , the increase of @xmath145 and @xmath146 is smoother compared to both flat and zig - zag interfaces .",
    "the lower plots show the photo - currents in each region @xmath127 : the transmitted and reflected waves are visible as current pulses of different widths .",
    "the back scattered waves arrive at the @xmath125 region at later times compared to the transmitted waves and the width of the current pulse is accordingly more dispersed . although the time - dependent quantities @xmath148 and @xmath149 depend on the specific choice of the @xmath127 domains , the observed behavior remains qualitatively the same .    for a complete characterization of a certain interface one has to perform statistical averages , taking into account the variation of the wavepacket parameters ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , shape etc ) .",
    "moreover , averages on different interfaces from the same class would be generally necessary . to investigate the charge localization on either side of the interface , a distribution of @xmath121",
    "may also be considered and subsequently a drift - diffusion type model may be employed to calculate the collected photo - current in a concrete device .",

    "the transparent boundary conditions are introduced in a natural way .",
    "the r - matrix method provides an efficient procedure of calculation the wavefunctions for a relatively large energy set , which is essential for an accurate description of the time - dependent transport .",
    "the detailed steps of the computational scheme are provided . as applications",
