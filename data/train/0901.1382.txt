    "recent measurements on nonphotonic electrons from decays of midrapidity heavy - flavored mesons in central heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have shown that the nuclear modification factor @xmath7 relative to @xmath4 collisions is significantly smaller than theoretical predictions based on radiative energy loss of heavy quarks in produced quark - gluon plasma  @xcite . to explain the observed small value of @xmath7 or large suppression of heavy meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "other mechanisms for energy loss of heavy quarks in quark - gluon plasma have been proposed  @xcite . also , it was suggested that the enhancement of charmed baryon production over charmed meson production , i.e. , the @xmath0 ratio , would suppress the @xmath8 of the electrons from heavy mesons  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that enhanced charmed baryon production reduces the production of charmed mesons and thus their contribution to decay electrons .",
    "in fact , experiments at rhic have shown that in central heavy ion collisions there is an enhanced production of midrapidity baryons in the intermediate transverse momentum region not only in light hadrons but also in strange hadrons .",
    "this enhancement could be described by multi - quark dynamics through quark coalescence or recombination  @xcite , baryon junction loops  @xcite , or long - range coherent fields  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one might expect enhanced heavy baryon production in the intermediate transverse momentum region as well .",
    "since the @xmath0 ratio has not been measured in heavy ion collisions , it was assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the same as the measured @xmath9 ratio or in ref .",
    "@xcite to have a gaussian form with a maximum value peaked at the transverse momentum @xmath10  gev .",
    "it was then claimed that a value of @xmath11 , which is about a factor of ten larger than that in @xmath4 collisions at same energy , could result in an additional @xmath12@xmath13% suppression of @xmath7 apart from the suppression due to the collisional energy loss of heavy quarks in quark - gluon plasma .",
    "however , it is not yet known what kind of underlying physics can cause such a large enhancement of the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "recently , enhancement of the @xmath0 ratio due to the existence of @xmath14 $ ] diquarks in strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) was suggested by lee _",
    "et al . _",
    "this was based on the idea of possible existence of quasi bound states of quarks and gluons including diquarks in qgp when the temperature is between @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath15 is the critical temperature for the quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter transition .",
    "based on the quark coalescence model , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath0 ratio could be enhanced by a factor of @xmath17@xmath18 relative to the case without diquarks in qgp , depending on the binding energy of the light diquark at @xmath19  mev .",

    "the resulting @xmath60 and @xmath169 charge radii are @xmath231  fm and @xmath232  fm , respectively , which are factors of @xmath233 and @xmath234 larger than those predicted by the light - front quark model of ref .",
    "the required smaller oscillator frequencies may be partly due to the change in hadron radii in medium  @xcite and partly due to the incomplete treatment of production and decay of hadron resonances in the present study .",
    "the second model assumes the diquark structure in @xmath37 and the existence of diquarks in qgp as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , @xmath37 baryons are formed by diquark  heavy - quark coalescence in addition to three - quark coalescence . in diquark structure .",
    "here we simply approximate this production process by three - quark coalescence to form non - diquark @xmath37 .",
    "this thus gives an upper bound for the yield of @xmath20 from three independent quarks in qgp as pointed out in ref .",
    "together with the @xmath39 and @xmath40 resonance contributions as well as those from @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath178 , @xmath142 , and @xmath179 resonances , which are formed only from three - quark coalescence as they do not contain the scalar diquark structure , excited @xmath235 and @xmath236 baryons are also included using the @xmath196-wave diquark  heavy - quark coalescence . as in the three - quark coalescence model , the oscillator frequencies or width parameters",
    "are determined by requiring that all low @xmath41 heavy quarks are converted to hadrons . besides the common oscillator frequency @xmath161 for mesons and three - quark baryons , the additional oscillator frequency for the heavy - quark and diquark system is fixed by reproducing the same @xmath37 radius used in the three - quark configuration .",
    "then we have @xmath237  gev for charmed hadrons and @xmath238  gev for bottom hadrons , leading to @xmath213  fm and @xmath239  fm for the @xmath60 and @xmath169 charged radii , respectively .",
    "these values lead to @xmath240  gev and @xmath241  gev , respectively , for charmed and bottom baryons consisting of diquarks . in obtaining the contribution of resonances to the ground state @xmath34 and @xmath37 spectra ,",
    "we neglect for simplicity the small momentum shift in their decays .    in both models ,",
    "remaining heavy quarks that are not converted to hadrons via coalescence , which mostly have high @xmath41 , are converted to heavy hadrons by fragmentation .",
    "this is achieved by assuming that a heavy quark of transverse momentum @xmath41 fragments into @xmath37 and @xmath34 with a ratio similar to that given by the pythia model , i.e. , @xmath242 + 0.1 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\left ( \\frac{\\lambda_b}{\\bar{b}^0 } \\right)_{\\rm fr } & = & 0.75 , \\label{eq : param}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 in unit of gev .",
    "our results for the relative production fractions of heavy hadrons produced in central au+au collisions at @xmath3  gev are presented in table  [ tab : ratio ] together with those from the pythia model and the thermal model .",
    "it is seen that the relative production fraction of @xmath35 among all produced charmed hadrons in the three - quark coalescence model is @xmath243 , while it is @xmath244 and @xmath245 for the thermal model and the pythia model , respectively .",
    "this fraction reduces to @xmath120 in the diquark model .",
    "the relative production fraction of @xmath36 among all produced bottom hadrons also shows a similar behavior , namely , it is @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 in the pythia model , the thermal model , the three - quark model , and the diquark model , respectively .    for the @xmath32 ratios , we find that without resonance contribution @xmath250 in the three - quark model and @xmath251 in the diquark model .",
    "these results are different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , the @xmath0 is larger and the enhancement of this ratio due to the presence of diquarks is about @xmath17 while it was about @xmath18 in ref .",
    "these differences come from the different values for the oscillator frequencies or width parameters as well as the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite the number of free quarks in the quark - gluon plasma is not reduced by the presence of diquarks . for bottom hadrons , we obtain @xmath252 in the three - quark model , which increases by a factor of @xmath253 to @xmath254 in the diquark model .",
    "including resonances enhances both @xmath37 and @xmath34 production .",
    "we find that in the three - quark model , about 70% of @xmath35 and about 90% of @xmath37 are produced through resonance decays .",
    "the importance of resonances is also seen in the diquark model .",
    "in particular , the diquark contribution through negative parity @xmath37 resonances is non - negligible .",
    "the number of negative parity @xmath37 resonance of spin-@xmath133 turns out to be about half of the ground state @xmath37 baryon number .",
    "since @xmath235 and @xmath236 resonances are almost degenerate in mass , the number of negative parity @xmath37 resonances is about two times that of the ground state @xmath37 after taking into account the spin degeneracy .",
    "this should be contrasted with the thermal model which predicts suppressed yields of negative parity @xmath37 resonances as a result of their larger masses . as a result",
    ", we find that about 70% of @xmath35 and about 75% of @xmath37 are produced through resonance decays in the diquark model .",
    "the contribution from heavy quark fragmentation is small , particularly to the ratios of particle numbers .",
    "this is because we have assumed that most hadrons are produced by coalescence of low @xmath41 heavy quarks .",
    "the fragmentation contribution is thus non - negligible only for high @xmath41 hadrons , which constitute less than 8% of produced total heavy hadrons .    the final @xmath32 ratios after including fragmentation and resonance contributions are @xmath255 for the three - quark model , and @xmath256 for the diquark model .",
    "therefore , the enhancement factor for these ratios due to diquarks in qgp is about @xmath257 for both charmed and bottom hadrons .",
    "our results thus indicate that the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) ratio in heavy ion collisions predicted by the coalescence model is about a factor of 6.4 ( 8.6 ) larger than the predictions of the pythia model in section  [ sec : pp ] and about a factor of 3.1 ( 7.0 ) larger than that from the thermal model in section  [ sec : thermal ] .",
    "the existence of diquarks in qgp further enhances this factor to 10.3 ( 12.6 ) and 5.0 ( 10.2 ) , compared to those from the pythia and thermal models , respectively .",
    "spectra of ( a ) @xmath20 and ( b ) @xmath35 , and ( c ) the ratio @xmath0 in midrapidity ( @xmath2 ) for central au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev .",
    "solid lines are for the three - quark model and dashed lines are for the diquark model .",
    "results from the pythia model are shown by filled circles . ]",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ fig : charm - fr ] for ( a ) @xmath73 spectrum , ( b ) @xmath36 spectrum , and ( c ) the @xmath1 ratio . ]    the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath37 and @xmath34 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : charm - fr ] and [ fig : bottom - fr ] for charmed and bottom hadrons , respectively , together with the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath32 ratio .",
    "solid lines are results for the three - quark model and dashed lines are those for the diquark model . compared with the pythia results shown by filled circles , the enhancement of @xmath37 yield and the suppression of @xmath34 yield are evident .",
    "the bottom hadron spectra are seen to be harder than the charmed hadron spectra due to the flatter bottom quark spectrum than the charm quark spectrum .",
    "compared with measured @xmath258 and @xmath9 ratios  @xcite , the obtained @xmath32 ratios show very different behavior .",
    "although the @xmath0 ratio has a similar shape as the @xmath258 and @xmath9 ratios , which could be approximated by a gaussian shape as assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has a much larger width and is thus much flatter than the light baryon / meson ratios .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 ratio is even flatter than the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "this behavior can also be found in the spectra of @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "namely , while the spectra of @xmath73 and @xmath36 have very similar @xmath41 dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bottom - fr ] ) , those of @xmath20 and @xmath35 show somewhat different @xmath41 dependence ( fig .  [",
    "fig : charm - fr ] ) .",
    "all these behaviors originate from the large mass of heavy quarks . in the infinite mass limit",
    ", the momentum of a heavy hadron is completely carried by the heavy quark , and the role of light quarks or diquarks is just to give different production probability depending on the heavy hadron wavefunction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath32 ratio in the infinite heavy mass limit becomes a constant and shows no momentum dependence . in the case of the @xmath0 ratio ,",
    "finite mass effects are not negligible but its dependence on the transverse momentum is less strong than in the @xmath9 ratio .",
    "this is clearly seen in @xmath4 collisions as shown by the pythia model results in figs .",
    "[ fig : charm - fr ] and [ fig : bottom - fr ] .",
    "although the coalescence model shows a @xmath41 dependence of the @xmath32 ratio , this dependence weakens as the heavy quark mass increases .",
    "we also find that inclusion of diquarks in qgp causes a shift of the peak positions in the @xmath32 ratios to lower values of @xmath41 . in the three - quark model , the @xmath0 ratio peaks at @xmath6  gev , which shifts to @xmath5  gev in the diquark model .",
    "the change of the peak position is caused by both the reduction of the @xmath35 meson spectrum and the enhancement of the @xmath20 spectrum in the diquark model .",
    "we find , however , that the latter has a larger effect on the peak position in the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "since the enhancement of @xmath20 due to light diquarks is more appreciable in the low @xmath41 region , the peak of the @xmath0 ratio in the diquark model thus appears at a lower value of @xmath41 compared to that in the three - quark model .",
    "the @xmath1 ratio also shows a shift in the peak position , i.e. , from @xmath259  gev in the three - quark model to @xmath94  gev in the diquark model , but it is still much flatter than the @xmath0 ratio .    for a more realistic momentum distribution of heavy hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions after their production from qgp , their production and annihilation due to collisions of and with surrounding particles should be investigated by a transport model like the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "however , cross sections for reactions involving open charmed hadrons are small  @xcite , and it has been shown in ref .  @xcite that the effects of multiple scattering would be small with such small cross sections . since this work is at the level of an exploratory study , such an elaborated investigation is not yet called for .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the @xmath32 ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) ratios in heavy ion collisions , particularly the enhancement of these ratios due to coalescence of heavy quarks with light quarks as well as diquarks that might exist in the produced qgp .",
    "we have also considered the resonance decay effects which are shown to be important for understanding the particle production ratios in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "our simple estimate based on the thermal model as well as predictions of more sophisticated statistical models  @xcite show that resonance decays also plays a crucial role for heavy hadron production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have , therefore , included the contribution from resonances in estimating these ratios .",
    "we have determined the width parameters of hadron wigner functions used in the coalescence model by requiring that the majority of heavy hadrons at low @xmath41 are formed from coalescence , which is similar to that assumed in the thermal model .",
    "the remaining heavy quarks are then converted to heavy hadrons via fragmentation as in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratios in central au+au collisions at @xmath3 gev are found to be @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively , which are about @xmath262 and @xmath263 larger than the predictions of the pythia model , and about a factor of @xmath264 and @xmath265 larger than those of the thermal model .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath32 ratio due to diquarks is , however , only about 1.6 for both charmed and bottom hadrons , which is smaller than that predicted in ref .",
    "the difference mainly arises from the different constraints used here and in ref .",
    "@xcite for determining the oscillator frequencies or width parameters in the hadron wigner functions and from maintaining the same total light quark numbers in both the three - quark model and diquark model in the present study .",
    "the enhancement due to diquarks would have been larger if we do not take into account the resonance contribution .",
    "this is because of the enhancement of @xmath37 baryons from @xmath39 and @xmath40 decays , whose production is not affected by the presence of diquarks in qgp .",
    "this is different from the production of strange @xmath105 to which @xmath104 can not decay by strong interactions .",
    "furthermore , including the resonance contribution increases the @xmath1 ratio much more than the @xmath0 ratio because @xmath72 can not decay into @xmath71 by strong interactions as a result of heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "finally , this model leads to the reduction of @xmath35 and @xmath36 mesons by factors of about @xmath266 compared to the pythia model .",
    "contrary to the pythia model , we have found that the yields of heavy baryons with strange quark(s ) are not small .",
    "their yield was estimated to be about 60% of the @xmath37 yield in the thermal model . in the coalescence model , this is about 50% and 35% of the @xmath37 yield in the three - quark model and diquark model , respectively .",
    "we have also compared the transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath32 ratios with that of measured @xmath9 ratio and found that the @xmath32 ratios have a weaker dependence on the transverse momentum because of the massive quarks inside heavy hadrons . in particular , this leads to a very weak dependence of the @xmath1 ratio on the transverse momentum .",
    "we have further found that the @xmath267 ratio peaks at @xmath6  gev in the three - quark model and at @xmath268  gev in the diquark model .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of heavy baryon production over heavy meson production due to diquarks can mostly be observed at low @xmath41 region .",
    "we have also estimated that the ratio @xmath269 , which is less than that of ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath270 .",
    "these results are based on a diquark mass of @xmath271  mev or a binding energy of @xmath272  mev .",
    "because of the thermal factor , the number of diquarks decreases as the diquark mass increases .",
    "this would reduce both @xmath20 and @xmath73 production and increase that of @xmath35 and @xmath148 , reducing thus the @xmath32 ratios .",
    "for example , if the diquark mass is @xmath273  mev , the enhancement of the @xmath0 ratio due to diquarks would reduce from 1.6 to @xmath274 . the peak position in the ratio changes , however , very little .    in studying resonance production in the coalescence model ,",
    "we have assumed that the effect due to energy mismatch between quarks and produced hadron is small .",
    "since the coalescence model can be viewed as formation of bound states from interacting particles in the system with energy mismatch balanced by other particles in the system , this would be reasonable if the energy mismatch is small .",
    "otherwise , the correction factor can , in principle , be determined by evaluating the transition probability in the presence of other particles .",
    "also , the coalescence model can be further improved by imposing energy conservation using breit - wigner type spectral functions for the produced hadrons  @xcite .",
    "this would naturally lead to suppressed production rate due to the energy mismatch between quarks and produced hadron . improving the coalescence model , therefore , deserves further studies .",
    "one may also consider contributions to heavy hadron production from other diquark states .",
    "it is well - known that the color - spin interaction for color - sextet diquark of spin-1 is , although not strong , attractive .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref  @xcite . )",
    "this diquark , of course , can not form a color - singlet baryon with one heavy quark , and color - sextet diquarks are thus disfavored in phenomenological models  @xcite . however , color - sextet diquarks in qgp can produce color - singlet baryons by first forming color - octet or color - decuplet baryons and then neutralizing their colors by interacting with quarks and gluons in qgp . therefore ,",
    "if we assume the existence of ( weakly - bound ) color - sextet vector diquarks in qgp , it may bring in additional enhancement of @xmath37 baryon production .",
    "since this mechanism is very model - dependent , the existence and properties of such diquark states in qgp should be understood before estimating their contributions to heavy hadron production .",

    "<S> heavy baryon / meson ratios @xmath0 and @xmath1 in relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied in the quark coalescence model . for heavy baryons , </S>",
    "<S> we include production from coalescence of heavy quarks with free light quarks as well as with bounded light diquarks that might exist in the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma produced in these collisions . including the contribution from decays of heavy hadron resonances and also that due to fragmentation of heavy quarks that are left in the system after coalescence , the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratios in midrapidity ( @xmath2 ) from central au+au collisions at @xmath3  gev are about a factor of five and ten , respectively , larger than those given by the thermal model , and about a factor of ten and twelve , respectively , larger than corresponding ratios in the pythia model for @xmath4 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> these ratios are reduced by a factor of about 1.6 if there are no diquarks in the quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse momentum dependence of the heavy baryon / meson ratios is found to be sensitive to the heavy quark mass , with the @xmath1 ratio being much flatter than the @xmath0 ratio . the latter peaks at the transverse momentum @xmath5  gev but the peak shifts to @xmath6  gev in the absence of diquarks . </S>"
