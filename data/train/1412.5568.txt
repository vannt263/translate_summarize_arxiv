    "life on earth is sustained mainly by the energy of sunlight harvested through photosynthesis .",
    "it has been found that the energy absorbed by photosynthetic system can be transferred to reaction center ( rc ) with an efficiency higher than 95% @xcite .",
    "understanding the extreme high efficiency of the excitation energy transfer ( eet ) through coupled dipoles in the basic photosynthetic unit is one of big challenges in research on revealing the secret of this natural phenomenon @xcite , and it also stimulates a motivation finding artificial bionic structures for energy storage and conservation , such as quantum dot nano - structures and polymer chain @xcite .    no matter for an artificial or natural eet system , there generally exists three kind of interactions : first , within the bio - molecular system there will be couplings among different dipoles ( sites ) and these couplings are of dipole - dipole interaction form @xcite .",
    "second , some dipoles will be excited after sequential dipole - dipole interaction and then dissipate the excitation energy into the rc @xcite , which is our expected process .",
    "otherwise , the excited sites would dissipate to the thermal environment and induce the energy loss .",
    "third , the dipoles will also interact with vibrational degrees caused by their intrinsic spatial structures ( sites of linear , cyclic or other structures ) and the motions induced by the thermal environment @xcite .",
    "for example , in photosynthetic unit systems the pigments will be affected by the vibrations in the surrounding protein matrix and intra - chromophore vibrational modes @xcite . to explore the role of vibrational modes played in the eet dynamics ,",
    "many studies has been performed both in experimental and theoretical forms @xcite .",
    "the basic unit of the eet systems includes a donor and an acceptor , each of which is usually treated as a two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "the two tlss couple each other in the form of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite . in some cases",
    "the energy separations of the two tlss are not the same ( for example , b850 and b800 bacteriochlorophylls have absorption peaks at 850 nm and 800 nm respectively @xcite ) , that is , energy transfer between the two tlss is a detuning dynamic process . in some artificial systems , the transition frequencies for",
    "the donor and the acceptor may also not be the same as well @xcite .",
    "as is well known , energy can hardly be transferred between two tlss with large detuning ( compared with the jc coupling strength ) without external assistance @xcite .",
    "therefore , an important question is arisen , how does energy transfer happen with extremely high efficiency in the natural large detuning bio - systems ?    in this work , we address to answer this question by theoretically exploring the energy transfer process in a detuning eet system assisted by the vibrational modes . to simplify the models we consider just energy transfer between one donor and one acceptor in the weak coupling regime @xcite , and study three cases : the basic model that only the donor couples with vibrational mode ; the advanced model 1 that both the donor and the acceptor couple with the identical mode ; the advanced model 2 that the two tlss couples with different mode individually .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section ii , we show how to obtain the effective hamiltonian of the basic model and discuss the coherent dynamics without any decoherent processes being considered . in section iii , the numerical results of the basic model are presented . in section iv and v , investigations of the advanced model 1 and 2 are shown respectively .",
    "the conclusion is made in section vi .",
    "in this section , we consider a basic model that includes a tls1 ( donor ) and a tls2 ( acceptor ) , with energy separations @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the two tlss is ( @xmath3 )    @xmath4    where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) corresponds to transition operator on site 1(2 ) with energy detuning @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the electronic coupling between the sites 1 and 2 .",
    "supposing that only the tls1 ( donor ) is coupled to a vibrational mode with the free hamiltonian @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the angular eigenfrequency of the vibrational mode , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the vibrational mode .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian between the tls1 and the vibrational mode can be expressed as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 corresponding to the coupling strength of the donor to the vibrational mode .",
    "then the hamiltonian describing the whole hybrid system has the form    @xmath15    performing a unitary transformation @xmath16 to @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and we obtain the interaction hamiltonian as following    @xmath19    as shown in appendix a , under the condition @xmath20 and supposing that the coupling is weak , i.e. , @xmath21 , we can obtain the effective hamiltonian under the markov approximation : @xmath22    from equation above , we find that the last term in the effective hamiltonian ( 4 ) describing coherent transfer among the donor , the acceptor and the vibrational mode with rate @xmath23 .",
    "we define two probabilities as @xmath24 tr@xmath25 $ ] ( @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 being the density matrix operator for the system . by supposing that the initial state of the system is @xmath28 , and no decoherent effects being considered , we plot the probabilities @xmath29 to show mechanism of the energy transfer in our setup in fig .",
    "1(a ) , 1(b ) and 1(c ) that are determined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , where @xmath32 represents the fock state of the vibrational mode with phonon number @xmath33 .",
    "verses time under different cases which are determined by hamiltonian @xmath30 ( blue solid line in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ) , @xmath31 ( red dashed line in ( b ) , ( c ) ) and @xmath34 ( red dashed line in ( d ) ) , respectively . here",
    "we set @xmath35.,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we find that the excitation of the acceptor is in a very lower probability without the assistance of the vibrational mode because the detuning is much stronger than the coupling between the two tlss . however , when the vibrational mode takes effects as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the coherent transfer in this hybrid system emerges and the acceptor can be excited in a high probabilities . to understand this process more clearly ,",
    "we give the energy level configuration that is shown in fig .",
    "we find that energy can be transferred from the donor to the acceptor ( the red solid line and the brown solid line ) with the phonon number increasing from @xmath33 to @xmath36 , that is , the detuning energy @xmath37 ( the excess energy ) between the donor and the acceptor leaks into the vibrational mode during the transition process .",
    "we show consistency of @xmath31 and @xmath30 under the weak coupling approximation by comparing fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) . in fig .",
    "1(b ) , as the coupling strength @xmath14 is much weaker than the detuning @xmath37 , we find the approximation of obtaining the effective hamiltonian @xmath31 from @xmath30 are valid . however , when the coupling strength becomes larger , difference of the figures can be observed as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , dynamics of probabilities @xmath29 determined by @xmath31 does not match so well with that determined by @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , as the effective spin - boson coupling strength is proportional to @xmath38 @xcite , when the initial phonon number @xmath33 is very large , i.e. @xmath39 , we can neglect the terms of energy shift in @xmath31 and obtain a more simple effective hamiltonian form @xmath40    the new form of the effective hamiltonian @xmath41 includes only coherent transfer terms inside the system . as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , when @xmath42 , the effects of energy shift terms which are contained in @xmath31 are suppressed , and the evolution described by @xmath43 and @xmath30 matches well , and @xmath29 can reach nearly 1 .",
    "we may point here that increasing phonon number at a certain range will enhance @xmath29 .",
    "we may also explain mechanism of the coherent energy transfer of our system semi - classically .",
    "for the vibration - donor coupling term @xmath13 , we can rewrite it as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the zero - point fluctuation of position amplitude for the vibrational mode @xcite .",
    "the new form of @xmath47 indicates that injection of an exciton of the donor creates a sudden force on the vibrational mode @xcite .",
    "because the interaction of the donor and the acceptor is of large detuning , there must exist a rabi oscillation with small amplitude for @xmath48 at central frequency around @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we plot the distribution of the amplitude @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is the angular frequency at frequency domain ) of the fourier transform of @xmath48 in fig . ( 3 ) , in which we know that there is indeed a peak around the eigenfrequency of the vibrational mode , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "it quite similar like that someone pushes a swing on its intrinsic frequency , although only an very weak force may be , the swing will oscillate with high amplitude after a relatively long time @xcite .",
    "for this hybrid system , the excess energy @xmath52 will leak into the vibrational mode resonantly .     of fourier",
    "transform for @xmath48 at the frequency domain .",
    "the parameters adopted are same with those in fig .",
    "as demonstrated in the latest section , the vibrational mode can indeed assist coherent transfer between two tlss without any decoherent effects being considered .",
    "however because that the environmental noise is inevitable , we may wonder whether the vibrational mode will also help to increase efficiency of energy transfer when the decay channels of the donor , acceptor and the vibrational mode take effects . in this section",
    ", we employ the numerical method to explore the role of the vibrational mode played in the hybrid dissipative system .",
    "we assume that the system is polluted by three incoherent processes : two tlss dissipate to the environment at rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively ; the acceptor can be sinked into the rc ( sink ) at a rate @xmath55 ; moreover , the vibrational mode decays to thermal environment at a rate @xmath56 with thermal phonon number @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath59 is the temperature .",
    "all of the processes can be described by the lindblad form terms @xmath60\\hat{\\rho}=\\omega ( a\\hat{\\rho}a^{+}-\\frac{1}{2}a^{+}a\\hat{\\rho}-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\rho}a^{+}a)$ ] .",
    "thus we can write the master equation of the whole system as follows @xmath61 + d[\\sigma_{1}^{-},\\gamma _ { 1}]\\hat{\\rho}(t)\\\\ & + d[\\sigma _ { 2}^{-},\\gamma _ { 2}]\\hat{\\rho}(t)+d[\\sigma _ { 2}^{-},\\kappa ] \\hat{\\rho}(t)\\\\ & + n_{th}d[b^{+},\\gamma ] \\hat{\\rho}(t)+(n_{th}+1)d[b,\\gamma ] \\hat{\\rho}(t )",
    ". \\end{split}\\ ] ]    we define a dissipation rate of the acceptor into the sink as @xmath62 , then the efficiency at a fixed time @xmath63 can be calculated as @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the tlss are in @xmath65 initially , and our numerical simulation is based on the single excitation subspace thoroughly @xcite . to approach the actual environmental conditions , in all of the following numerical calculations , we assume that the vibrational mode has reached the thermal equilibrium states and the associated density matrix is @xmath66 . thus the initial density matrix for the whole system can be expressed as @xmath67 .",
    "we then perform the numerical simulations based on the master equation ( 6 ) and plot the time - dependent probabilities and the efficiency shown in fig .",
    "4 .    comparing fig .",
    "4(a ) with fig .",
    "4(b ) , we find that evolution of the system have significant differences of the donor coupling or no coupling with the vibrational mode . when the donor is decoupled with the vibrational mode as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , it is found that @xmath68 , which means the acceptor is hardly excited and the efficiency is very low because of large detuning . in this case , most of the energy leaks out from the donor by dissipative processes and can not be transferred to the acceptor . however , when the vibrational mode takes part in which is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the situation is totally different : the tls2 can be excited with a high probability and the efficiency can reach above 80% .",
    "this can be understood as following . for the incoherent initial thermal state @xmath69",
    ", we may first obtain @xmath70tr@xmath71 $ ] by solving the master equation ( 6 ) with the initial sate @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) individually for different @xmath33 , because @xmath74 is only an incoherent mixed state with different fock states , there is no coherence between @xmath75 , and then we can obtain weighted average @xmath76 . for each @xmath33 ,",
    "when the vibrational mode is coupled with the eet system , there will be a coherent transfer between state @xmath28 and @xmath77 .",
    "it means that the energy can be transferred to the acceptor and as a result the phonon number of the vibrational mode increasing from @xmath33 to @xmath36 ( as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . directly energy transfer from tls1 to tls2 without helpfulness of the vibrational mode is not an energy conservation process .",
    "however the transfer between state @xmath28 and @xmath77 with the assistance of vibrational mode satisfies energy conservation ( @xmath78 , thus it can happen with a high probability .",

    "we now discuss a more complex case : the donor and the acceptor are coupled with different vibrational modes , respectively .",

    "that is , the excess energy @xmath103 leaks into the vibrational mode 1 or mode 2 , which is similar as advanced model 1 .",
    "however , these two channels are independent because the two modes are independent .",
    "thus there is no coherent cancellation and the relative coupling phase @xmath98 does not affect the evolution of the whole system , which can be proved by the numerical results in fig . 8 with choosing @xmath111 and @xmath113 . where we suppose the initial state is @xmath156 , where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the the thermal states for the vibrational mode 1 and vibrational mode 2 with @xmath84 .     of the blue line ,",

    "moreover , because both two channels take effects , the efficiency @xmath85 gets larger more quickly and the steady value is slightly higher than the case that @xmath160 ( red lines marked with squares ) , which corresponds to the basic model discussed in section iii .",
    "in summary , we have studied the energy transfer process between two detuning tlss assisted by the vibrational modes . by analyzing the effective hamiltonian of the system",
    ", we found that there exists second order coherent transfer channels in these hybrid systems .",
    "the excess energy ( detuning between two tlss ) can leak into the vibrational modes via these channels , and thus both coherence and the eet efficiency can be improved significantly . by supposing the vibrational modes are initially in incoherent thermal states , we find the eet efficiency is higher in a relatively high temperature environment .",
    "we also find that the quantum interference between two channels plays an important role in the evolution of the system and affects the final eet efficiency greatly .",
    "our results may open up experimental possibilities to investigate and explore detuning coherent transfer phenomena in artificial and natural excitation energy transfer systems .",
