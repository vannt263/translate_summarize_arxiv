    "to obtain information about the nucleon s gluon helicity distribution @xmath2 and to explore its contribution to the proton s spin is the main focus of several current experiments .",
    "one of the probes employed for this purpose at cern s compass experiment is @xmath3 , where @xmath1 denotes a charged hadron produced at high transverse momentum .",
    "kinematics for the process are chosen in such a way that the photons exchanged between the muon and the nucleon are almost real , so that the process effectively becomes @xmath4 .",
    "its double - longitudinal spin asymmetry @xmath5 is directly sensitive to @xmath2 , thanks to the presence of the photon - gluon fusion subprocess @xmath6 .",
    "compass has recently presented data for the spin - averaged cross section  @xcite for the process , as well as for its spin asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the produced hadron s large transverse momentum , the process @xmath4 may be treated with perturbative methods . as is well known  @xcite , hard photoproduction cross sections receive contributions from two sources , the `` direct '' ones , for which the photon interacts in the usual pointlike way in the hard scattering , and",
    "the `` resolved '' ones , for which the photon reveals its own partonic structure .",
    "both contributions are of the same order in perturbation theory , starting at @xmath7 , with the electromagnetic and strong coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo , @xmath10 ) qcd corrections for the spin asymmetry for @xmath4 have been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for the direct and resolved cases , respectively .    as discussed in  @xcite , in the kinematic regime accessible at compass perturbative corrections beyond nlo are important .",
    "this is because typical transverse momenta @xmath11 of the produced hadron are such that the variable @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 the muon - proton center - of - mass energy ) is relatively large , @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the partonic hard - scattering cross sections relevant for @xmath4 are largely probed in the `` threshold''-regime , where the initial photon and parton have just enough energy to produce a pair of recoiling high-@xmath11 partons , one of which subsequently fragments into the observed hadron .",
    "the phase space for radiation of additional gluons then becomes small , allowing radiation of only soft and/or collinear gluons . as a result , the cancelation of infrared singularities between real and virtual diagrams leaves behind large double- and single - logarithmic corrections to the partonic cross sections .",
    "these logarithms appear for the first time at nlo and then recur with increasing power at every order of perturbation theory . threshold resummation  @xcite allows to sum the logarithms to all orders to a certain logarithmic accuracy .",
    "it was applied to the spin - averaged cross section at compass at next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) level in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the resummation of both the direct and the resolved contribution was performed .",
    "the resummed result for the cross section was found to be significantly higher than the nlo one , by roughly a factor two .",
    "comparison to the compass data reported in  @xcite showed that this enhancement is crucial for achieving good agreement between data and the perturbative - qcd prediction .    in the light of this result , it is clear that threshold resummation should also be taken into account in the theoretical analysis of the spin asymmetry @xmath5 measured at compass  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 is the ratio of the spin - dependent cross section and the spin - averaged one .",
    "since the latter has already been addressed in  @xcite , we will in this paper examine threshold resummation for polarized scattering . as a first step",
    ", we will consider the direct contributions to the cross section , which are simpler to analyze and also formally dominate over the resolved ones near partonic threshold .",

    "we note that the resolved contribution to @xmath4 is structurally equivalent to hadronic scattering @xmath15 , for which threshold resummation was performed in the previous literature even for the polarized case  @xcite",

    "again the nlo expansion of the resummed cross section reproduces the full nlo result faithfully , although not quite as well as in the unpolarized case .",
    "these features that we observe for the direct part of the polarized cross section may be understood from the fact that the two competing lo subprocesses @xmath164 and @xmath6 enter with opposite sign and thus cancel to some extent .",
    "this was already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the nlo calculation .",

    "even though the resolved contributions also have gluon - initiated subprocesses and hence are sensitive to @xmath2 , they have significant uncertainty due to the fact that very little is known about the spin - dependent parton distributions of the photon .",

    "the main trends are qualitatively similar , although the redcuction of @xmath5 is slightly less pronounced .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the dssv2008 set has a smaller gluon helicity distribution @xmath2 , so that the compton process @xmath164 dominates , which has a positive partonic spin asymmetry and receives similar resummation effects in the unpolarized and the polarized case .",

    "it is worth mentioning that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem appears to be especially pronounced in the rapidity range @xmath173 and for positively charged hadrons .",
    "while the higher order resummed corrections that we have included ameliorate the situation , they are clearly not sufficient . given the rather large decrease of the spin asymmetry generated by resummation of the direct contributions , it is arguably not possible to draw any reliable conclusions form this observation before also the resummation for the resolved part of the cross sections has been carried out .",
    "it appears unlikely , however , that the resolved contribution and its resummation will bring the data and theoretical results into good agreement since they affect the asymmetries for both targets in similar ways .",
    "if , for instance , the polarized resolved contribution were so large and negative that the proton data could be accommodated , the description of the deuteron asymmetry would vastly deteriorate  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the impact of threshold resummation at next - to - leading logarithmic level on the spin - dependent cross section for @xmath4 at high transverse momentum @xmath11 of the hadron @xmath1 , and on the resulting double - longitudinal spin asymmetry @xmath5 . for the present work ,",
    "we have implemented the resummation only for the direct contribution to the cross section . for the kinematics relevant for the compass experiment",
    "we find that the spin - dependent cross section receives much smaller enhancements by resummation than the spin - averaged one treated in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", threshold effects do not cancel in the double - spin asymmetry , and the prediction for @xmath5 decreases when resummation is taken into account .",
    "definite conclusions about the impact of resummation on the spin asymmetry will become possible only when also the resummation for the resolved component has been carried out , which we plan to do in future work .",
    "only then will an extraction of the proton s gluon helicity distribution @xmath2 become meaningful .",
    "we also note that the scale dependence of the perturbative cross section remains uncomfortably large even when resummation for the direct piece is taken into account . in order to improve this it may , eventually , be necessary to extend resummation to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic level , following the techniques developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "comparison to the recent compass data  @xcite shows that the theoretically predicted spin asymmetries fail to reproduce the data well . especially for the proton target",

    "in fact , it is worth stressing that each of the theoretical results shown in fig .",
    "[ asymmetry - compass ] predicts a _ larger _ spin asymmetry for the proton than for the deuteron , in contrast to the trend seen in the data .",
