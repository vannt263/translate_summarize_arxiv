    "we considered a situation in which an emitter radiates spherical waves of the real massless scalar field and revealed a mechanism which generates the orbital angular momentum of the scalar wave through gravitational effects . as an example of a source of gravity , we considered a black hole .",
    "we solved the equation of motion of the massless scalar field in the curved spacetime by invoking the geometrical optics approximation .",
    "the basic equations of the geometrical optics are the geodesic equations with the null condition on the geodesic tangent and the transport equation : the former determines the trajectory of the wave , whereas the latter determines the amplitude of the wave . due to the gravitational lensing effects , there are infinite number of null geodesics from the emitter to the detector and there are infinite number of corresponding  plane waves \" which propagate along those null geodesics .",
    "the amplitudes of them are very different from each other at the detector .",
    "we take into account only three null geodesics along which locally plane waves with the largest , the second largest and the third largest amplitude at the detector .",
    "we showed that the superposition of the two locally plane waves at the detector is sufficient for the generation of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "however , in order to find the effect of the frame dragging caused by the rotation of the black hole through the detection of the orbital angular momentum , the superposition of the only two is not sufficient and the more than two rays are necessary . in the case of the non - rotating black hole ,",
    "the components of the orbital angular momentum parallel to the direction cosines of all images do vanish .",
    "by contrast , if the black hole is rotating , all of them do not vanish due to the frame dragging which makes the direction cosines of three images linearly independent .",
    "our result may be available to the electromagnetic waves .",
    "although it seems to be very challenging to observe them , our result suggests that the measurement of the orbital angular momentum of the electromagnetic waves can be a probe of the spin parameter of the rotating black hole , in principle .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that if there is no gravitational lensing effect , or in other words , if there is only one image , the orbital angular momentum identically vanishes ( see eq .",
    "( [ l - detect ] ) ) .",
    "this fact implies that if we detect the non - vanishing orbital angular momentum of the electromagnetic wave , we may conclude that the multiple images comes from a single emitter or the magnification of the apparent luminosity occurs by the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "we should note that it is not easy task to see whether the multiple images or magnification of the apparent luminosity comes from the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the detection of the orbital angular momentum may give us a novel criterion for the occurrence of the gravitational lensing .",
