    "the orion nebula hosts the richest cluster of   young ( @xmath7  myr ) pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars within 1  kpc of the sun and therefore represents an ideal laboratory to understand the process of star formation ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* for recent reviews ) . the cluster , both rich ( @xmath8 members ) and dense ( about @xmath9  sources per cubic parsec at its center ) , is dominated by a small number of massive ob  stars mostly clustered in the trapezium multiplet ( @xmath10  ori ) .",
    "their uv  emission has created a blister hii   region ( _ orion nebula , m  42 , ngc  1976 _ ) whose ionization front is still carving the underlying orion molecular cloud . about half of the young cluster members , surrounded by their original circumstellar disks , have been already exposed to the hard - uv  radiation of the trapezium stars , whereas the other half remain enshrouded within the omc-1 , together with newer active sites of star formation .",
    "visible and near - ir  data , both in imaging and spectroscopy , are needed to characterize the main physical parameters of the cluster population @xcite .",
    "these observations , however , are hampered by the brightness and non - uniformity of the nebular background .",
    "to overcome these difficulties , we have exploited the unique combination of sensitivity and spatial resolution offered by the hubble space telescope ( hst )  to obtain accurate photometry of the cluster , especially at substellar masses ( hst  treasury program go-10246 ) .",
    "our extensive hst  survey has been complemented by ground - based observations , imaging the orion nebula from the _ u_-band to the -band at la silla and cerro tololo ( ctio )  observatories .",
    "the ground - based observations , carried out in parallel on the same nights ( but at a different epoch than the hst observations ) , complement the deep hst data which saturate at relatively low brightness levels .",
    "their simultaneity makes the derived stellar colors largely immune to the uncertainties associated with source variability .",
    "the ground - based survey at visible wavelengths , performed with the wide field camera ( wfi ) at the eso / mpg 2.2  m telescope at la silla , has been recently presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the ground - based ir  survey , performed at the ctio / blanco telescope with the ispi  imager .",
    "its combination of sensitivity and field coverage ( about @xmath1 ) ideally complements the previous surveys of this region .",
    "in particular , it reaches fainter magnitudes than the wide field survey ( @xmath11 ) by hillenbrand et al .",

    "all these deep surveys concentrate on a field centered around the trapezium stars , or in its immediate surroundings in the case of @xcite .    in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we discuss the observing strategy , while in section  [ sec : reduction ] we describe the data reduction and photometric calibration . in section  4",
    "we present our completeness analysis .",
    "the resulting source catalog is presented in section 5 , whereas in section 6 we discuss the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams and the luminosity function derived from our , , and -band photometry .",
    "the infrared side port imager ( ispi ) is the facility infrared camera at the ctio blanco 4  m telescope .",
    "ispi uses a 2k @xmath16 2k hgcdte hawaii-2 array , with reimaging optics providing a scale of 0.3 arcsec / pixel corresponding to a 10.25 @xmath16 10.25 arcmin field of view .",
    "our target area , about @xmath17 , covers the field imaged with the hst .",
    "the observations were performed on the nights of 1 and 2 january 2005 ( indicated hereafter as night a and night b respectively ) in the ,  and  filters using the double correlated sampling readout mode .",
    "the main filter parameters are listed in table  [ tab_ispi_filters ] .",
    "the seeing was @xmath18 in most of the -band images and occasionally worse on night b.    the survey area was divided into eleven fields ( figure  [ fig : ispi_fields ] ) .",
    "the central position of each field , together with the airmass of the observations , is listed in table  [ tab_ispi - logbook ] . each field",
    "was observed with an abba  pattern . after pointing the telescope to the center of a field ( a  position )",
    "a 5 point dithering pattern was executed offsetting the telescope approximately by @xmath19 along the field diagonals .",
    "this first group of 5 dithered exposures was followed by a second group of sky frames ( b position )   taken on a nearby field free , or nearly free , of diffuse nebular emission to extend the field coverage and monitor the flat - field response close in time to our observations .",
    "the sky - source sequence was then repeated back , completing the abba cycle .",
    "this provides a total of 10 frames of 30  s exposure for the common part of each field , totalling 300  s integration .",
    "due to the high background , we split the -band 30  s exposures in two consecutive 15  s exposures , maintaining the background well within the linear regime .",
    "each dithering sequence was repeated with a 3  s integration time .",
    "these short frames were coadded into another image of 30  s total integration time , which we used to extract the photometry of sources saturated in the longer exposures . due to an error in our observing procedure ,",
    "the -band observations of field 3 were obtained only with 3  s exposures .    for absolute calibration we observed at various airmass the faint ir standard stars 9108 , 9118 and 9133 of @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , on both nights the atmospheric transmission at ir  wavelengths turned out to be unstable due to variations in the water vapor opacity , and we eventually derived the zero point calibration of our images through comparison with the extensive set of 2mass data across our wide field area , as described in section  [ sec : calib ] .",
    "the first step in the data reduction was the correction for the intrinsic non - linearity of the detector , which we performed by applying the correction curve kindly provided by n. van der bliek .",
    "we flat - fielded each image using dome flats and correct for residual color terms at low - spatial frequency using delta - flats derived from median averaged sky images .",
    "the dome flats were also used to flag bad pixels .",
    "the sky frames , properly filtered to remove spurious sources arising from the latent images of bright stars on the infrared detectors , were combined and subtracted from the science images .    since ispi exhibits significant field distortion , each science image had to be geometrically corrected before being combined in a dithering group .",
    "this required a first pass of aperture photometry with daophot , in order to extract a source catalog with well measured centroids and photometry ( to disentangle the case of multiple candidates in the search radius ) .",
    "these sources were then cross - identified with the 2mass catalog for astrometric reference , building an image distortion map relating their position on the original images to the actual position provided by 2mass . due to the non - uniform distribution of sources , clustered at the center of the nebula",
    ", the accuracy of the distortion correction map varies across each field .",
    "therefore , we combined the distortion maps relative to all images taken on the same night to derive , for each filter , a master distortion map .",
    "each individual image was then warped using a 4th - order polynomial fit with coefficients derived from the corresponding distortion map .",
    "images belonging to the same dithered groups were then combined per integer pixels into single @xmath20 images .",
    "the daophot source extraction was then repeated on these geometrically corrected images to produce a new source catalog from which we derived the final astrometric solution of each image by minimizing the residual shift and rotation with respect to the 2mass positions .",
    "the average scatter between our coordinates and the corresponding 2mass  coordinates turns out to be about 0.15  arcsec , i.e. , half of a ispi  pixel .",
    "the same procedure has been adopted on the 3  s images .    in conclusion",
    ", for each field the final data consist of one combined image in each of the 3 filters ( , , ) and exposure times ( 300  s and 30  s ) , with the exception of fields 4 , 5 , and 6 , which have double this number of images , and field 3 , which was not observed with deep   images .",
    "the extraction of source photometry was performed on the final combined images , for both short and long exposure times .",
    "the daophot find idl procedure was used to extract an initial list of candidate sources , with rather loose detection thresholds and criteria to include the largest possible number of candidates .",
    "this initial list , counting more than 60,000 candidates , has been visually inspected on the original images to clean up artifacts and to preliminarily classify real sources as either point - like or extended .",
    "the list was then reduced to 7563 sources , divided between 6305 point - like and 933 diffuse .    for all sources we first derived an aperture magnitude by integrating the flux over a 5 pixel ( 1.5  arcsec )  radius circular aperture , taking sky annuli typically between 10 and 15 pixels ( 3.0 - 4.5  arcsec )",
    "; for 1416 bright sources , saturated in the 30  s images , we used the photometry extracted from the 3  s images .",
    "we then performed psf photometry on all point - like sources . due to the spatial variability of the psf across the field of view of ispi , present even after geometric correction",
    ", we divided each image in 9 parts ( 3@xmath163 squares ) allowing for some overlap between adjacent sub - images .",
    "the samples of stars in each sub - image , still relatively rich , had a more homogeneous psf   allowing us to reliably derive psf magnitudes .",
    "we subtracted the psfs  and looked at the residual images searching for faint companion stars previously undetected .",
    "we found in this way 325 `` hidden companions '' .",
    "finally , we performed a second pass of psf  photometry , first by removing from the list of stars used to derive the psf  those having a faint companion , and then deriving also the photometry of the newly detected faint companions .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : obs ] , the ir  photometric quality of our nights turned out to be unsatisfactory due to hygrometric variability .",
    "we therefore calibrated our ispi instrumental magnitudes directly to the 2mass photometric system .",
    "the 2mass catalog provides absolute photometry in the  ( 1.25 ) ,  ( 1.65 ) , and  ( 2.17 ) bands to a limiting magnitude of 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3 , respectively , with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 .    to estimate the color terms and zero points of each image",
    ", we first scaled the instrumental psf  magnitudes of point sources measured in the short 30  s images to the long 300  s images , chosen as the reference time because of their source richness . to minimize systematic effects due do atmospheric variations",
    ", we did not simply add the nominal @xmath21 factor but compared the instrumental magnitudes of well measured stars to derive for each field and filter a mean magnitude offset @xmath22 between the short and long images . by homogenizing in this way the zero points of the short and long images , we add a small uncertainty to the photometric errors of the bright stars measured in the short exposures . for each bandpass @xmath23",
    "we then evaluated the relations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the magnitudes in the 2mass  photometric system , @xmath26 is the ispi  instrumental magnitude , the intercept @xmath27 is the zero point in a given bandpass , the slope @xmath28 is a color coefficient between the wavelengths @xmath29  and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the corresponding observed ispi  color .",
    "we found the strongest statistical correlation in the combination : @xmath32 for each field , we derived the linear fit parameters @xmath33  and @xmath34 using an iterative procedure to rejects spurious outliers and all sources with errors greater than @xmath35 in the 2mass catalog and @xmath36 in our input catalog .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : fitpar ] , the color coefficient @xmath34 varies slightly from field to field during each night , whereas the zeropoint @xmath37 shows an increase towards the middle of the night ( observation were scheduled with fields 4 and 10 transiting at the meridian , in the two nights ) .    for the  and  bands , we derived the zero - points and the color terms from a linear fit to the color relations @xmath38 this allowed us to derive magnitudes calibrated in the 2mass  system for all sources with ispi @xmath39 instrumental photometry . in figure",
    "[ fig : lin2lin ] we show a comparison between the magnitudes reported in the 2mass catalog and our calibrated magnitudes .",
    "the plots show the lack of systematic differences , besides the random errors that we attribute to photometric errors or stellar variability .    for sources lacking one or",
    "two magnitudes ( typically either  or both  and ) , we assumed a linear relation of this type @xmath40 deriving @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for each bandpass and field , from the sample of calibrated sources .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 provides a magnitude - dependent correction to the zero point @xmath42 , which is appropriate since fainter sources have , on average , redder colors . using these coefficients we calibrated the magnitudes , with the relative uncertainties , of all remaining sources .",
    "figure [ fig : magerrcal ] shows the photometric errors plotted as a function of magnitude for all point - like sources .",
    "the multiple threads in the distribution of the photometric errors are due either to the superposition of deep and short exposures ( bright stars , measured in short 3  s exposures , turn out to have relatively larger errors ) or to the sources measured , with higher photometric errors , in the crowded central part of the cluster . for comparison",
    "we also plot the average mag vs. delta mag relation for the 2mass   sources falling in our field .",
    "to determine the completeness of our photometric catalog , we used an artificial star experiment . for each field and filter , we averaged the 9 psfs created for photometric extraction ( section [ sec : datasec ] ) into a common reference psf valid for the full image .",
    "we scaled the reference psf in steps of 0.1  mag covering the entire magnitude range measured across each field and injected each scaled psf   at a random position in the image , with the only caveat of leaving enough distance from the border to allow for a meaningful measure .",
    "we assumed as a detection criterion a photometric error less than 0.3  mag and less than 0.5  mag difference between the injected and recovered magnitude , making also sure that the stars recovered by the code were the artificial ones and not previously known real stars .",
    "the completeness was calculated as the fraction of successful detection after 1000 iterations of the process , for each magnitude bin .",
    "it turns out that the completeness ( and the sensitivity )  of our survey is significantly affected by the nebular brightness .",
    "we have therefore defined three concentric regions ( figure [ fig : cyl ] ) at increasing distance from @xmath10ori - c .",
    "the limiting radii , respectively 6.7 , 14.3   and 27.2  ( corresponding to projected distances of 0.81 , 1.72 and 3.27  pc at a distance of 414  pc , @xcite ) have been set in such a way that the three regions contain the same number of point - like sources . in order to avoid significant contamination from the m43 cluster , we neglect in our analysis a circle with a @xmath43 radius centered on nu  ori ( ra(2000.0)=@xmath44 , dec(2000.0)=@xmath45 ,",
    "see figure  [ fig : cyl ] ) .",
    "the results of our simulations are shown in figure [ fig : complet ] .",
    "for each filter , the completeness estimated in the outer region is slightly , but systematically , larger than that in the intermediate region , which in turn is much larger than in the bright inner region , the most heavily affected by crowding and diffuse emission , where our sensitivity begins to drop at  @xmath46  mag .",
    "a  comparison with @xcite and @xcite , who surveyed the inner part of the cluster ( @xmath15 and @xmath47 fields , respectively ) deriving @xmath48 photometry down to our photometric limit ( @xmath49  mag ) , shows that we detect as point sources more than 90% of their sources ( 648/706 in the -band and 657/698 in the -band for  @xcite and 601/662 ( ) and 665/714 ( ) for @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : compare ] , where we overplot the luminosity functions ( lfs ) obtained by @xcite and @xcite ( dashed lines ) to our observed lfs ( gray area ) constructed for their same regions , confirms that the missing sources are generally fainter than @xmath50  mag ( the missing bright sources , detected but not measured by ispi due to saturation , are not relevant here ) .",
    "if we apply to our  and  lfs the appropriate completeness corrections , estimated by repeating the artificial star experiment on the same fields of @xcite and @xcite , our lfs   become consistent with theirs , with the exception of the secondary peak at @xmath51  mag discussed by @xcite . in section  [ sec : lf ]",
    "we will apply the completeness corrections to the measured counts , when we will compare the lfs at various distances from the cluster center .",
    "our final photometric catalog contains 7759 sources .",
    "having visually inspected all sources , we find that 6630 can be classified as point - like sources and 933 as diffuse objects .",
    "the other 174 sources , typically brighter than @xmath52 , turn out to be saturated even in our short 3  s images .",
    "we included them in our catalog , adopting the photometry and coordinates reported by 2mass .",
    "we also found that the 2mass photometric catalog misses 22 sources in the trapezium region clearly visible in the 2mass images and saturated even in our short exposures .",
    "we have added their  photometry using the @xcite photometry .    in table",
    "[ tab : catalog ] we summarize the number of sources measured in different combination of filters , exposure times , and morphological types .",
    "the source catalog , presented in table [ tab : samplecat ] , is available in the electronic edition of this paper . in appendix",
    "[ sec : database ] we illustrate the content of each field of the source catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig : orionrgb ] shows a  color composite of our imaged field .",
    "the image , produced by the graphic staff of the space telescope science institute , has been artificially enhanced to reduce the original dynamic range and more clearly reveal the inner part of the cluster .",
    "figures  [ fig : findingmap]-19 provide 12 finding charts , starting from the trapezium region ( figure  [ fig : findingmap ] ) and continuing with the 11 fields ( figure  9 to 19 ) .",
    "the sources are coded with circles having sizes proportional to their brightness and colors scaled from blue to red according to their observed -  colors .",
    "in this paper we present a preliminary analysis of the data , concentrating on the point - like sources of the orion nebula cluster having the full set of  photometry with magnitude errors @xmath53 , with the exception of sources seen only in field 3 ( thus lacking the deep  exposure ) and within @xmath54 from nu  ori , i.e. , lying in the field of the satellite nebula m43 , about @xmath55 northeast of the trapezium . our sub - sample",
    "is therefore composed by 4103 sources .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ccd]a we show the near - ir  _ - _ versus _ - _ color - color diagram .",
    "following @xcite , we overplot the intrinsic colors of the main - sequence stars and giant branch , together with the locus of classical t  tauri stars ( cttss ) surrounded by circumstellar disks @xcite , given by the relation @xmath56 in the 2mass photometric system",
    ". we also plot the interstellar reddening vector of @xcite , given by the relation @xmath57 in the 2mass  photometric system .",
    "accounting for extinction , the locus of the cttss lies between the two parallel dotted lines defined by the equations @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    for 45.2% ( 1853/4103 ) of the sources , the near - ir  colors are consistent with those of stellar dwarfs ( luminosity class v ) , giants  ( luminosity class iii ) or cttss reddened by various amounts of foreground extinction . for 11.4% ( 466/4103 ) of the sources the near - ir  excess is compatible only with the reddened cttss , whereas only 0.8% ( 35/4103 ) of the sources show near - ir excess significantly greater than those of cttss , indicative of strong -band excess .    to assess how the observed reddening and color excess vary with the distance from the center of the cluster",
    ", we consider the hess diagrams for the three radial regions .",
    "the inner field ( figure  [ fig : ccd]b ) shows a peak well detached from the main sequence , with iso - density contours elongated in a direction parallel to the cttss locus , together with a long tail of stars with high reddening .",
    "the hess diagram for the intermediate region ( figure  [ fig : ccd]c ) shows a main peak much closer to the locus of dwarf stars , together with a secondary maximum at higher extinction .",
    "the intermediate contour levels ( e.g. the green area ) are now elongated along the range of reddened main sequence stars .",
    "finally , the hess diagram for the outer region ( figure  [ fig : ccd]d ) shows again a strong peak compatible with dwarf stars affected by a small amount of extinction , whereas the low contour levels appear less pronounced than in the two other regions and well within the limits of reddened main sequence or giant stars .",
    "overall , the three color - color diagrams can be interpreted as follows :  1 )  the inner trapezium region is mostly populated by young stars with near - infrared excesses typical of cttss .",
    "they have generally relatively modest amounts of extinction , which is compatible with the fact that the ionizing radiation from the trapezium stars has cleared the molecular cloud and exposed them to our view ; 2 )   the intermediate region contains a relatively larger number of heavily reddened sources .",
    "they are seen through denser parts of the omc , not yet reached by the expansion of the ionized cavity ; 3 ) the outer regions mostly contain background objects seen trough the low opacity layers at the edges of the main omc ridge , which crosses the onc approximately in north - south direction @xcite .       in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] we present the ( , - ) and ( , - ) color - magnitude diagrams still for the same sample .",
    "together with our data , we plot the 1  myr isochrone of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cba00 ) , which covers the range @xmath60 and is tailored to model substellar and planetary mass objects in the limit of high opacity photospheres .",
    "we also plot the 1  myr isochrone of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sie00 ) ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , well - suited for stellar sources .",
    "both isochrones have been converted to the 2mass photometric system using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "the offset between the two isochroness can be regarded as a graphic representation of the uncertainties in theoretical models .",
    "an @xmath63 reddening vector is also indicated , as well as the reddening lines starting from the isochrones in correspondence of a @xmath64 object ( = 10.50 , = 9.88 and = 9.76 at 414  pc in the 1myr ` sie00 ` isochrone ) , a m=0.075  @xmath65 object at the hydrogen - burning limit mass ( = 14.29 , = 13.86 and = 13.56 at 414  pc in the 1myr ` cbah00 ` isochrone ) and a @xmath66 substellar object at the deuterium - burning limit mass ( = 17.33 , = 16.90 and = 16.48 at 414  pc in the 1  myr ` cbah00 ` isochrone ) . for this distance and isochrone , we are therefore sensitive to stellar sources down to @xmath67 , brown dwarfs down to @xmath68 , and planetary mass objects down to @xmath69 .",
    "almost all data points lie to the right of the isochrones and are therefore compatible with reddened 1  myr old sources ( as well as heavily reddened field objects ) .",
    "if we discard the blue sources with @xmath70 , typically affected by large measurement errors , we find that the reddening lines identify 2246 sources in the region of reddened stellar photospheres , 1298 sources in the region of reddened brown dwarfs and 142 sources in the region of reddened planetary mass objects . in the ( , - ) color - magnitude diagrams these values are 2134 , 1145 , and 421 , respectively .    splitting the cluster in the same three regions of figure  [ fig : cyl ] ,",
    "we obtain the color - magnitude diagrams presented in figure  [ fig : cmhess ] . from top to bottom",
    ", figure  [ fig : cmhess ] shows the ( , - ) ( left column ) and ( , - ) color - magnitude diagrams for the inner , median and outer regions , respectively .",
    "consistent with what was found analyzing the color - color diagrams , the inner and outer regions appear dominated by two different populations .",
    "the top diagrams clearly reveal the location of the onc : an ensemble of stellar sources with modest amounts of foreground extinction .",
    "the bottom diagrams are dominated by fainter sources ( of course , for background stars the 1  myr isochrone at 414 pc does not apply ) , whereas the intermediate region contains a mix of both populations",
    ". a careful look at the diagrams show that the peak corresponding to the onc drifts down ( i.e. , to lower masses ) and left ( to lower extinction values ) moving from the inner to the outer regions .",
    "the shift to lower masses represents an overabundance of higher mass sources at the center of the cluster , in agreement with the evidence for mass segregation found by @xcite .",
    "the redder color of the cluster members in the central field may be due to the fact that they are , on average , either more embedded in the omc or subject to higher circumstellar extinction from their heavily warped or flared circumstellar disks @xcite , or a combination of the two .",
    "we conclude our analysis showing the ,   and -band luminosity functions ( lfs ) for all point - like sources . once again , we remove stars less than @xmath54 projected distance from nu  ori and divide the remaining sample in three groups according to the distance criteria adopted in the previous sections . rather than assuming a certain completeness limit , we fully apply our completeness corrections , derived in section  [ sec : compl ] , to the source counts measured in the various regions .",
    "the histograms for the inner region ( figure  [ fig : lfcomplfig ] , thick solid line ) show a broad peak at @xmath71 , @xmath72   and @xmath73 , corresponding to an m6 star ( 0.175  m@xmath74 ) at 1  myr , according to the @xcite model with zero reddening .",
    "the peak shows an abrupt drop at about @xmath75 and @xmath76 , approximately by a factor @xmath77 , which is fully consistent with the previous near - infrared studies of the onc , e.g. figure  5 of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosity functions corrected for completeness remains remarkably flat across the substellar region down to our sensitivity limit .",
    "this is not what has been found by other authors who concentrated on the innermost area .",
    "we remark that our completeness correction has the largest effect in the inner region , the one more affected by crowding and by the brightness of the nebular background . on the other hand , we have seen that our completeness correction fails to reproduce the @xmath78 secondary peak of @xcite , and for this reason can hardly be suspected of providing an artificial overcorrection in the central area .    moving from the inner to the outer parts of our survey area ,",
    "the main peak in the lfs becomes less prominent in the median region and eventually disappears in the outer regions giving to the lfs  an increasing monotonic slope .",
    "if we compare our -band lf  for the outer cluster with the @xmath79-band lf  of the off - cluster control field presented by @xcite ( figure 3a of their paper ) , which shows no stars brighter than @xmath80 , we see that our outer field still contains a fraction of sources belonging to the cluster or , more in general , associated to the recent star formation events in the orion region ( i.e. possible foreground members of the orion ob1 association ) .",
    "this is in agreement with what we found in the previous section discussing the color - magnitude diagrams , not by chance since the lf represents the projection on the vertical axis of the color ",
    "magnitude plot .",
    "the flattening of the substellar lfs in the inner region may be due to field star contamination . to address this possibility",
    ", we can use our outer field as a control field , knowing that it will probably provide an overestimate of the contribution of non - cluster sources and therefore , after subtraction , a lower limit to the cluster lf .",
    "this for two main reasons :  first , we have seen that our outer field still contains a fraction of cluster - related sources and , second , background sources should be more easily observed in the outer field rather than in the central region due to the larger background extinction caused by the underlying omc-2 , which has the ridge of highest density crossing the cluster core nearly in a north - south direction ( see e.g. the extinction map obtained from the c@xmath81o column density data of @xcite presented in fig 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfcomplfig ] ( bottom , gray area ) shows the lfs corrected in this way , having properly normalized the source densities to the same surface area .",
    "there is a clear reduction of source density in the substellar regime and the main peak becomes more prominent , but the substellar lfs seem to remain flat or show , at best , a very modest negative slope .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to account for the higher background extinction beyond the central field , and therefore remove at least some of the systematic bias introduced by using the outer field , by shifting the outer lfs , for each filter , by magnitude values compatible with the interstellar reddening law of @xcite .",
    "this because with a proper , wavelength dependent , change of zero points one can use the outer field counts to reproduce the luminosity functions that would have been observed with higher foreground extinction .",
    "if we refer again to the @xcite extinction map , we see that the very central part of the omc-2 is characterized by a visual extinction as high as @xmath82 . for",
    "a detailed analysis one should account for the spatial variation of the extinction , as done e.g. by @xcite , but for the moment let s simply assume the lfs  of the outer region and put all sources under @xmath83  mag , @xmath84  mag , and @xmath85  mag , corresponding to @xmath86  mag .",
    "it is immediate to see that shifting the monotonically increasing field lfs to the right by a few magnitudes and subtracting them from the central ones produces no visible change on the central ones .",
    "one can therefore safely conclude that the true lf of the inner region lies between the one derived above subtracting the outer field source density ( corresponding to a fully transparent background ) and the one originally observed ( corresponding to a fully opaque background ) , which means that the inner lfs overall remain quite flat in the brown - dwarfs regime ( 0.075 - 0.012@xmath65 ) . in a future paper",
    "we will address the implications of this result on the cluster inititial mass function , evaluating the foreground extinction and the stellar parameters of the point sources on the basis of the rich set of multicolor photometry obtained for the hst   treasury program on the orion nebula .",
    "we have presented a photometric survey of the orion nebula cluster in the - , - and -passbands carried out at the 4 m telescope of cerro tololo .",
    "the survey , covering a field of about @xmath1 centered about @xmath87  southwest of the trapezium , has been performed in parallel to visible observations of the same region made in la silla ( da rio et al .",
    "the two datasets constitute the first panchromatic survey covering simultaneously the orion nebula cluster from the _ u_-band to the -band .",
    "the final catalog , photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to the 2mass   system , contains 7759 sources , ( including 174 and 22 sources whose photometry has been taken directly from the 2mass  and @xcite catalogs , respectively ) .",
    "this represents the largest near - ir  catalog of the orion nebula cluster to date .",
    "our sensitivity limits allow to detect objects of a few jupiter masses under about @xmath88 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "we present the color - color diagrams , color - magnitude diagrams and the luminosity functions for three regions centered on the trapezium containing the same number of sources ( excluding the m43 sub - cluster ) .",
    "sources in the inner region typically show ir  colors compatible with reddened t  tauri stars , whereas the outer fields are dominated by field stars seen through an amount of extinction which decreases with the projected distance from the center .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams allow to clearly distinguish between the main onc population , spread across the full field , and background sources .",
    "after correction for completeness , the luminosity functions in the inner region remains nearly flat , with marginal contamination from background sources .",
