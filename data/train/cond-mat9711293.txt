    "it is well understood that the first interlayer separation of metal surfaces is typically contracted at room temperature  @xcite , and only few exceptions to this `` rule '' have been discovered so far .",
    "due to the anharmonicity of the inter - atomic potentials , both the surface interlayer spacing and the bulk lattice constant depend on temperature .",
    "furthermore , because of lower symmetry , the anharmonicity at the surface is expected to be more significant than that in the bulk .",

    "we note that the surface structure obtained in this way corresponds to @xmath1 k and neglects the effects of zero - point vibrations . with respect to the latter we note that for example for the crystal bulk zero - point vibrations give rise to an increase of the lattice constant by about 0.2 - 0.5% , compared to the geometry determined by the total - energy minimum  @xcite .",
    "starting from the `` static equilibrium '' geometry , surface phonons were calculated either directly ( using the supercell approach )  @xcite or by applying density - functional perturbation theory  @xcite .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the equilibrium geometry is determined by the minimum of the free energy , which , in addition to the total energy , includes the contribution from lattice vibrations .",
    "typically this gives rise to a lattice expansion , but it is also possible that contractions occur @xcite . because anharmonicity is more pronounced at the surface than in the bulk an increased interlayer spacing of the top layer , @xmath2 , is to be expected  @xcite .",

    "the effective vibrational `` modes '' considered in these works correspond to modes at the brillouin zone center for the top layer vibrating on a rigid substrate .",
    "no information about the true surface phonon spectrum was obtained , and thus , not even an attempt was made to discuss how a good - quality summation over the phonon brillouin zone may affect the result .",
    "in fact a better treatment is quite elaborate as it requires the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix of the whole slab . in order to improve on the previous calculations  @xcite , we present in this paper a theoretical study of the structure and dynamics of rh(100 ) and rh(110 ) surfaces by including vibrations of the whole slab .",

    "it can be seen that when only the @xmath50 point vibration is taken into account , the variation of @xmath76 with temperature is in close agreement with the results of ref .",

    "it is these localized surface phonons that are most sensitive to the surface relaxations , and hence govern the anharmonic thermal expansion at the surface .",
    "it can be seen in figs .",
    "[ figure6 ] and [ figure7 ] that there are more localized surface phonon modes polarized in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions than in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the parallel vibrations give a more important contribution to the thermal expansion ( see figs .",

    "in conclusion , we have used full - potential fp - lapw method to investigate the surface structures and surface phonon spectra of rh(100 ) and rh(110 ) surfaces .",
    "we studied the thermal expansion by taking anharmonicity into account within the quasiharmonic approximation .",
    "it is found that different phonons give different contributions to the surface relaxation in the range of high temperature ( higher than 300 k ) .",
    "the surface thermal expansion coefficients calculated by including all the high symmetry points in surface brillouin zone are 40.7@xmath93 for rh(100 ) and 59.4@xmath93 for rh(110 ) at @xmath84=300 k , which are 5.0 and 7.2 times larger than that of the bulk , respectively .",
    "the obtained surface relaxations of rh(100 ) and rh(110 ) at @xmath94 k are in agreement with the experimental measurements at room temperature .",
