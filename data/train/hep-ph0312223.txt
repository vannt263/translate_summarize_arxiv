    "as we approach the centennial of the discovery of cosmic radiation by victor hess in 1912 , the astrophysical origin of these high energy particles remains still unknown . even so the study of cosmic rays has been extremely rewarding for particle physics . as hess noted in his nobel lecture in 1936 : _ `` the investigation of  cosmic rays  has led to the discovery of the positron  it is likely that further research into `` showers '' and `` bursts '' of the cosmic rays may possibly lead to the discovery of still more elementary particles  of which the existence has been postulated by some theoretical physicists in recent years''_. indeed several such discoveries were made in rapid succession  the muon in 1937 , the pion in 1947 and strange particles ( kaons , hyperons ) also in 1947 .",
    "however with the development of particle accelerators in the 1950 s , the attention of particle physicists turned naturally to controlled laboratory experiments .",
    "no other new particles have subsequently been discovered in cosmic rays although there have been several false alarms ( e.g. free quarks , monopoles ,  ) and many claims of unexplained phenomena ( e.g. ` centauro ' events ) .",
    "today we have another such mystery  the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) which can not propagate very far through the cosmic microwave background , are unlikely to be significantly affected by cosmic magnetic fields , and yet which do not point back to any plausible astrophysical sources in our vicinity @xcite .",
    "the intriguing question is whether an explanation is possible in terms of known physics or will require physics beyond the standard model .",
    "as we have just heard from prof teshima , the agasa collaboration has reevaluated the energy determination method used for analysing their data on air showers collected over 12 years , with particular attention to the lateral distribution , attenuation with zenith angle , shower front structure , delayed particles observed far from the shower core , etc @xcite .",
    "they confirm that the energies assigned to agasa events have an event - reconstruction accuracy of @xmath1 at @xmath2 , while the systematic uncertainty is @xmath3 ( independent of primary energy above @xmath4 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ spec ] , the agasa data at the highest energies connects smoothly with the ( better sampled ) akeno data at lower energies .",
    "there are 59 events with @xmath5 ( and 8 events beyond @xmath2 ) which have a spectrum distinctly flatter than at lower energies , suggestive of a different origin , but with no indication of the gzk cutoff expected if the sources are cosmologically distant .    )",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] ) .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by contrast the hires air fluorescence experiment , with a similar exposure in the mono mode , has reported only 1 event above @xmath2 , consistent with a gzk cutoff @xcite . but as is clear from fig .",
    "[ spec ] , the absolute fluxes are lower than those measured by agasa and the begining of the ` ankle ' in the spectrum is distinctly lower , suggestive of an energy calibration mismatch bewtween the fluorescence and air shower detector data .",
    "( since the spectrum falls as @xmath6 below the ankle , the fractional error in the flux is twice that in the energy , keeping in mind the change in the differential energy interval with the energy . )",
    "if the agasa energies are lowered by @xmath7 , the spectral shapes can be matched below @xmath2 @xcite , however 5 agasa events still remain above this energy .",
    "given the low event statistics , the significance of the discrepancy between the two experiments is not overwhelming , nevertheless it is clearly of paramount importance to resolve the issue and establish a consistent energy scale .",
    "the engineering array of the pierre auger observatory @xcite has already collected several ` hybrid ' events observed using both type of detectors so progress is expected soon .",
    "the other important new result concerns the agasa data on the angular distribution of events on the sky @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ agasaaniso ] , although the large - scale distribution of the 59 observed showers with @xmath8 is consistent with isotropy , there are a number of ` clusters '  defined as a grouping of 2 or more events within ( approximately the experimental angular resolution of ) 2.5@xmath9 .",
    "the chance probability that the 5 observed doublets and 1 triplet result from an isotropic distribution is estimated by monte carlo to be less than @xmath10 @xcite . however fig .",
    "[ agasaaniso ] shows that when the events are partitioned by energy , small - scale clustering is seen only for events with @xmath11 ; at higher energies there is _ no _ clustering @xcite .",
    "( circles ) and @xmath12 ( squares ) , with the ` doublets ' and ` triplet ' highlighted ( the shaded area is unobservable by agasa ) @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the angular autocorrelation function for events above various energy thresholds @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +   ( circles ) and @xmath12 ( squares ) , with the ` doublets ' and ` triplet ' highlighted ( the shaded area is unobservable by agasa ) @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the angular autocorrelation function for events above various energy thresholds @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to estimate the significance of the clustering reliably , one should calculate the ` penalty factor ' for making _ a posteriori _ cuts ( in energy thresholds and angular separations ) on the data set in order to maximize the clustering signal .",
    "secondly , as was emphasized earlier @xcite , the data set used to make the initial claim for clustering ought not to be used in the actual analysis . recently both",
    "these issues have been investigated in detail @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ agasascan ] , the strongest autocorrelation signal ( @xmath13 ) is seen at separation angle @xmath14 , with energy threshold @xmath15 .",
    "however monte carlo tests show that 3475 out of @xmath16 simulated agasa data sets have @xmath17 so the chance probability for this is 0.35% .",
    "this is 10 times higher than the value claimd earlier @xcite  these authors did not allow for their ( arbitrary ) choice of @xmath18 to maximise the clustering signal and interpreted their result as implying that the _",
    "`` correlation function of ultra - high energy cosmic rays favors point sources''_. secondly , when the agasa data is divided into 2 roughly equal sets ( 30 events detected before october 1995 and 27 events detected afterwards ) , the chance probabilities jump to 4.4% ( @xmath19 ) and 27% ( @xmath20 ) respectively for the observed clustering @xcite ! the reason appears to be that the two sub - sets of data are strongly correlated  the ` triplet ' being made of 2 events from the first set and 1 from the second .",
    "moreover agasa has announced more events bringing to 42 the number detected since october 1995 .",
    "there are 2 ` doublets ' separated by less than @xmath21 in this data set but the chance probability for having observed these is 19% @xcite . thus the clustering observed by agasa is _ not _ statistically significant , so does not require the observed uhecrs to originate from point sources",
    ".     shown in 4 views @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the chance probabilities for the observed clustering separately for the 30 and 27 events , observed before and after oct 1995.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=68.0% ] +   shown in 4 views @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel shows the chance probabilities for the observed clustering separately for the 30 and 27 events , observed before and after oct 1995.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    nevertheless , some authors have sought for and found statistially significant correlations between uhecr arrival directions and possible sources such as ( specific subsets of ) active galactic nuclei .",
    "in particular a selected sample of 39 agasa events ( with @xmath22 ) and 26 yakutsk events ( with @xmath23 ) are claimed to have significant alignments within @xmath21 with 22 selected bl lacartae objects ( having redshift @xmath24 or unknown , magnitude @xmath25 and 6 cm radio flux @xmath26 jy ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is @xmath28 and the penalty factor for making cuts on the bl lac catalogue is estimated to be only 15 , yielding a chance probability of @xmath29 @xcite . however the yakutsk experiment has an angular resolution worse than @xmath30 at the low ( sub - gzk ) energy cut made to maximise the coincidences , so these can not be physically meaningful ; dropping these events increases the chance probability for the remaining coincidences ( with agasa events ) to 0.15% @xcite .",
    "also the assumption that the _ `` energies of the events are not important for correlations at small angles '' _",
    "@xcite is clearly wrong since a mild drop in the energy threshold for agasa events to @xmath31 decreases the significance further by a factor of 5 @xcite .",
    "relaxing the cuts on the bl lac catalogue yields only 2 coincidences between bl lacs and agasa ` doublets ' , with a chance probability of 6.3% @xcite .",
    "moreover an independent sample of 27 haverah park and 6 volcano ranch events with @xmath31 do not coincide at all with the chosen 22 bl lacs @xcite .",
    "thus , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bllacs ] , there is no justification for the claim that _ `` bl lacertae are sources of the observed ultra - high energy cosmic rays '' _ @xcite .     observed by agasa , with the 5 ` doublets ' and 1 ` triplet ' highlighted .",
    "the left panel shows the 22 bl lacs ( dots ) satisfying specific cuts on redshift , magnitude and 6  cm radio flux @xcite , while the right panel shows all 306 bl lacs in the catalogue @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   observed by agasa , with the 5 ` doublets ' and 1 ` triplet ' highlighted .",
    "the left panel shows the 22 bl lacs ( dots ) satisfying specific cuts on redshift , magnitude and 6  cm radio flux @xcite , while the right panel shows all 306 bl lacs in the catalogue @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    finally , the inferred composition of uhecrs ( as well as their energies ) is sensitive to the uhe interaction model used @xcite and this realization has muddled the picture suggested earlier by fly s eye and hires of a change from heavy nucleus domination at @xmath32 to nucleon domination at @xmath4 .",
    "present data is consistent with a mixed composition at all energies .",
    "reanalysis of ` horizontal showers ' at haverah park requires that no more than 50% of uhecrs above @xmath33 can be photons @xcite and a similar ( but weaker ) limit has been set by agasa on the basis that photon - initiated showers tend to be muon - poor @xcite .",
    "however the showering of uhe photons is rather complex ( because of pair conversion in the geomagnetic field and the lpm effect ) , e.g. it can not be excluded that the highest energy fly s eye event ( @xmath34 ) was in fact initiated by a photon @xcite .",
    "_ no _ astrophysical object has ever been definitively identified ( e.g. through @xmath35-ray or @xmath36 emission ) as an accelerator of high energy nucleons .",
    "however there do exist energetic objects such as @xmath35-ray bursts , active galactic nuclei , or extended lobes of radio galaxies which satisfy the ` hillas criterion ' of being big enough and/or having sufficiently large ( estimated ) magnetic fields to be able to confine uhecrs upto @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the issue of whether particles can actually be accelerated to the observed energies in such objects is an open one , in particular considerations of radiative energy losses during the acceleration process set very strong constraints @xcite .",
    "ultrarelativistic bulk flows in @xmath35-ray bursts ( grbs ) remain a possibility , and this coupled with the hires claim of a gzk cutoff in the energy spectrum , have revitalized the suggestion that such cosmologically distant objects are the sources of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "however the energetic requirements are formidable  such sources must inject @xmath38 erg / mpc@xmath39/yr in uhecrs of energy @xmath40 in order to match the observed flux , while grbs are observed to emit roughly this much power at far smaller energies of @xmath41 mev .",
    "it is hard to conceive of a particle acceleration mechanism that can generate comparable amounts of power in such widely separated energy regions .",
    "nevertheless if there is indeed a gzk cutoff , this is probably the most attractive possibility for the sources of uhecrs .",
    "however if the uhecr spectrum does extend without a gzk cutoff as indicated by agasa , then new physics would appear to be required .",
    "we discuss below only those possibilities which have not been ruled out already .",
    "( in particular we do not consider whether the primaries might be neutrinos having enhanced interaction cross - sections through new physics such as tev - scale extra dimensions  this _ can not _ explain the observed uhecrs , although studies of airshowers can in principle probe such new physics @xcite .",
    "we also disregard the hypothesis that the primaries are new light stable hadrons ( for which the gzk cutoff energy can be higher ) , since such particles are _ excluded _ by laboratory experiments @xcite . )",
    "it was noted long ago that a small modification of the relation between momentum and energy in special relativity may undo the gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "if the clustering of events claimed by agasa is substantiated by the forthcoming high statistics data from auger , then point sources of uhecrs would be implicated . in that case",
    "it may be appropriate to invoke such violation of lorentz invariance to explain the absence of the gzk cutoff in the spectrum .",
    "however it is hard to see how this possibility can be falsified since the required violation is so small that it need not manifest itself in any other astrophysical or laboratory phenomenon @xcite .",
    "since at least one species of relic neutrinos must have a mass @xmath42 , it is attractive to suppose that these provide a target for uhe neutrinos from distant sources to annihilate on .",
    "this would create ` z - bursts ' with an energy of @xmath43 , i.e. in the right energy range to be a source for uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the nucleons and @xmath35-rays resulting from @xmath44 decays is well known so a detailed comparison can be made with the agasa data .",
    "agreement is obtained for a relic neutrino mass of @xmath45  ev @xcite , however the required uhe @xmath36 flux is very large , taking into account that such light relic neutrinos can not cluster significantly @xcite .",
    "although there are no direct bounds yet at these energies , it seems implausible that the required extragalactic sources of @xmath46 neutrinos can exist , given the restrictive bounds on deeply penetrating air showers from experiments such as fly s eye , as well as agasa and rice @xcite .",
    "moreover it is not clear how such high energy neutrinos can be created in the hypothetical cosmic sources  usually this would require the acceleration of even higher energy nucleons !      the possible existence of relic metastable massive particles whose decays can create high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos had been discussed @xcite before the detection of the famous fly s eye event with @xmath47 which focussed attention on the possible absence of the gzk cutoff .",
    "subsequently this idea was revived and it was noted that such particles , being cold dark matter , would naturally have a overdensity by a factor of @xmath48 in the halo of our galaxy @xcite . hence if their slow decays generate uhecrs , all propagation effects will be unimportant ( except possibly for photons ) in determining the observed spectrum and cosmposition , and , moreover , there should be a detectable anisotropy in the arrival directions , given our asymmetric position in the galaxy . in order to account for the highest energy events with the observed rates ,",
    "the particle mass should exceed @xmath49 while to match the uhecr flux its lifetime must be @xmath50  yr , where @xmath51 is the fraction of the halo dark matter in the form of such particles .",
    "it is conceivable that such particles exist in the ` hidden sector ' of string / m - theory @xcite and can be produced with a cosmologically interesting abundance at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the decay products is essentially determined by the physics of qcd fragmentation so can be calculated e.g. by evolving the fragmentation functions measured in @xmath52 decay upto the energies of interest using the dglap equations @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has included electroweak corrections and a more careful treatment of the possible effects of supersymmetry . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fit ] , the evolved spectrum of nucleons is in good agreement with the ` flat ' component of uhecr extending beyond @xmath53 .",
    "however the decay photons , which have a similar spectral shape are more abundant by a factor of @xmath54 , so this model ( as well as a similar subsequent proposal involving annihilations rather than decays @xcite ) would seem to be ruled out by the experimental bounds @xcite on the photon component of uhecrs .",
    "it is possible that the attenuation of such uhe photons in the halo of the galaxy ( through pair production on @xmath55mhz frequency radio photons ) has been underestimated  the radio background intensity assumed for such calculations is very uncertain @xcite .",
    "however , such attenuation would in turn generate a background of low energy @xmath35-rays and it is necessary to check that this does not exceed observational limits , particularly from egret at @xmath56  mev . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] , such constraints can indeed be satisfied although the required increase in the intensity of the radio background is rather large @xcite .",
    "perhaps one should wait for auger to establish whether photons are indeed ruled out as the uhecrs .",
    "( excluding the hires data ) with a decaying dark matter particle mass of @xmath57 ( dashed line ) ; the dotted line is the extension of the spectrum observed at lower energies @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    /p ratio for various assumed values of the radio background is compared with experimental limits ( right panel ) @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]",

    "the amplitude of the anisotropy is controlled by the extent of the halo , while the phase is controlled by its shape . as seen in fig .",
    "[ halo ] , the amplitude of the first harmonic is @xmath58 for a cusped ` nfw ' halo but falls to @xmath59 for an isothermal halo which is more favoured by observations @xcite , while the maximum is in the direction of the galactic centre with deviations of up to @xmath60 for triaxial and tilted haloes . to detect the predicted anisotropy ( for the likely case of an isothermal halo with large core radius )",
    "will require detection of @xmath61 uhecrs by auger ; this should also suffice to determine the angular phase to within @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "another signature of this hypothesis is the expected uhe neutrino flux , which was indeed the first to be studied @xcite .",
    "recent detailed calculations @xcite indicate that the expected flux should yield @xmath63 events / yr with @xmath64 in icecube @xcite and a similar number of events in rice @xcite . of course other proposed models for uhecrs",
    "also predict associated fluxes of uhe neutrinos .",
    "however an unique test is the expected flux of neutralinos if these are the lightest stable supersymmetric particles @xcite . in principle",
    "euso @xcite can discriminate such events from neutrino - induced ones @xcite .",
    "after a long hiatus , high energy cosmic rays have again become very interesting for particle physicists looking for evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the source of the highest energy particles in nature is an equally interesting enigma for astrophysicists .",
    "as lematre first suggested , the origin of such particles may even be linked to the early universe , although not quite as he imagined ! presently the data are tantalising but not sufficient in either quantity or quality to distinguish definitively between proposed models . the good news that this will soon be remedied by the pierre auger observatory @xcite .",
    "about 100 water cerenkov detectors and 2 fluoresence detectors are now operational , covering an area twice that of agasa , and the full array should be operational by the end of 2005 .",
    "moreover the ambitious space - based experiment euso @xcite , scheduled for a 3-year engineering flight on the international space station ` columbus ' in 2007 , will provide another substantial increase in collecting power .",
    "this is an exciting time for cosmic ray physics and we look forward to the surprises that nature has in store for us .",
    "it is a particular pleasure to present this talk at krakw which has had such a distinguished history of cosmic ray research  i understand that the first international iupap conference on cosmic rays was in fact held here in 1947 , during which powell announced the discovery of the pion ! i wish to thank paolo lipari and henryk wilczynski for their kind invitation , and all the organisers of this meeting for their efficiency and hospitality .",
