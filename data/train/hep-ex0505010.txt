    "<S> this energy threshold was well below the 60gev of the lowest - energy protons from  decays , all of which entered the calorimeter , and above the energy where the calorimeter efficiency plateaued at @xmath17% . since there was a high probability that both the  and the would hit the ss hodoscope and since the os hodoscope had two layers of counters , the efficiency of the lr subtrigger was extremely high ( @xmath1899.5% ) . </S>",

    "<S> biases , on the other hand , such as uncorrected detector inefficiencies , are fixed in the laboratory frame . </S>",
