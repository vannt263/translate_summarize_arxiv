    "this paper is about monoids and groups defined by a presentation . as is well - known",
    ", it is hopeless to directly read from a presentation the properties of a group or a monoid : even recognizing whether the group is trivial is undecidable in general  @xcite .",
    "however , partial results may exist when one restricts to presentations of a special form : a typical example is the small cancellation theory , in which a number of properties are established for those groups or monoids defined by presentations satisfying some conditions about subword overlapping in the relations @xcite .",
    "another example is adyan s criterion @xcite which shows that a presented monoid embeds in the corresponding group if there is no cycle in some graph associated with the presentation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a combinatorial property of positive group presentations ( , of presentations where all relations are of the form @xmath0 with only positive exponents in  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 ) that we call completeness , and to show that several nontrivial properties of the associated monoid and group can be read directly when a complete presentation is known : the properties we shall investigate here are cancellativity , existence of common multiples , embeddability in a group of fractions in the case of the monoid , solution for the word problem , and isoperimetric inequality in the case of the group .",
    "what we do in each case is to give sufficient conditions for the monoid or the group defined by a supposedly complete presentation to satisfy the considered property .",
    "a typical example is prop .",
    "[ p : canc ] , which states that , if @xmath3 is a complete presentation , then a sufficient condition for the associated monoid to be cancellative is that @xmath4 contains no relation of the form @xmath5 or @xmath6 with @xmath7 : thus , if there is no obvious counter - example to cancellativity , then there is no hidden counter - example either .",
    "the interest of such results could be void if complete presentations did not exist .",
    "actually , they do : it is even trivial that every group admits complete presentations  as the name suggests , a complete presentation is one with enough relations , and the full presentation consisting of all relations is always complete .",
    "the interesting case is when there exists a finite ( or , at least , simple ) complete presentation : we shall see that this happens for a number of groups , such as many generalized braid groups ( in particular some of those associated with complex reflection groups  @xcite ) , more generally all garside groups of  @xcite , but also quite different groups , such as the heisenberg group , which is nilpotent .",
    "the main technical ingredient we shall use is a combinatorial transformation called _ word reversing_. it is a refinement of the monoid congruence , in the sense that applying reversing to a word gives an equivalent word , but , in general , the converse is not true , , it is not true that any pair of equivalent words can be produced ( or , better , detected ) using reversing .",
    "essentially , we say that a presentation is complete when the latter occurs , in which case the uneasy study of word equivalence can be replaced with the easier study of reversing .",
    "it seems that the reversing process has been first considered in  @xcite , and it has been investigated  and in particular some notion of completeness has been considered  in several papers  @xcite , but so far always in the particular case of presentations with few relations , namely the so - called complemented presentations where there exists at most one relation @xmath8 for each pair of letters  @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "k.  tatsuoka in  @xcite ( in the case of artin groups ) and r.  corran in  @xcite ( in the case of singular artin monoids ) have independently developed equivalent processes in slightly different frameworks , but always with equally or more restricted initial assumptions .",
    "the current work addresses arbitrary positive presentations .",
    "the advantage of such a generalization  which forces to renew the technical framework  does not only lie in the new groups that become eligible , but rather in the underlying change of viewpoint .",
    "previously , the principle was to study the possible completeness of a ( complemented ) presentation : in good cases , the presentation was complete and one could deduce consequences  as in the case of the standard presentation of the braid groups @xcite or of their alternative presentation of  @xcite  otherwise , if the presentation was not complete , one could say nothing .",
    "our current approach enables us not only to establish the completeness of a presentation , but also , if needed , to complete an initially incomplete presentation .",
    "this completion process may require an infinite number of steps , but , in good cases , it is a finite procedure , and we shall see on examples how it enables us to investigate some monoids or groups that remained outside the range of all previously known methods . in particular , we obtain a new method for proving that a monoid embeds in a group of fractions , and apply it to answer a question of  @xcite about a nonstandard presentation of artin s braid group  @xmath11 introduced by v.  sergiescu in  @xcite .",
    "one of the applications of word reversing is ( in good cases ) a solution of the word problem .",
    "let us mention here some similarity between this solution and dehn s algorithm for hyperbolic groups : in both cases , the idea is to decide whether a word represents  @xmath12 without introducing any new pair of generators  @xmath13 or  @xmath14 .",
    "however , contrary to dehn s algorithm , the reversing algorithm may increase the length of the words , and it is not linear in general , but , on the other hand , it works for groups that are not word hyperbolic , such as the braid groups , or even the heisenberg group , whose isoperimetric function is known to be cubic .    the rather vague description above might remind the reader of the knuth - bendix completion method  @xcite , which also consists in starting with a group presentation , possibly adding some consequences of the initial relations , and obtaining a so - called complete rewrite - system that enables one to solve the word problem ",
    "see @xcite for examples in the case of spherical artin groups .",
    "the similarity with the current approach is superficial only : our method also possibly provides a solution to the word problem by means of rewriting rules , and the rle of the cube conditions in our completion procedure is analogous to that of critical pairs in  @xcite , but there seems to be no more precise connection in general , and we do not see how to attach any confluent rewrite - system to the combinatorial word transformations we consider , in particular because we simultaneously use positive and arbitrary words , , we work both with the monoid and the group . actually , more than in the knuth - bendix method , our approach originates in garside s analysis of the braid monoids  @xcite : with our current definitions , the proof of prop .",
    "h in  @xcite , as well as that of the krzungslemma of  @xcite is a proof that the standard presentations of the ( generalized ) braid groups is complete .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : redr ] , we define the general reversing process and establish its basic properties . then , in sec .  [ s : comp ] , we introduce completeness , and , again , establish basic results , in particular that every monoid admits a complete presentation . in sec .",

    "[ s : embe ] , we investigate similar questions for the group : recognizing groups of fractions , solving the word problem , computing bounds for the isoperimetric function",
    ".    a number of notions will appear with a right and a left version .",
    "we shall use @xmath15- for `` right '' and @xmath16- for `` left '' : @xmath15-reversing , @xmath15-completeness , etc .",
    "our aim is to study groups and monoids from a presentation . here",
    "we consider positive group presentations , defined as those presentations where all relations have the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are nonempty positive words , , inverses of the chosen generators do not occur in  @xmath1 or  @xmath2 . at the expense of adding new generators ,",
    "this is not a restriction in the case of groups , but this means that we restrict to monoids with non nontrivial units .",
    "our notation will be as follows .",
    "if @xmath17 is a nonempty set , we denote by  @xmath18 the free monoid generated by  @xmath17 , , the set of all words on  @xmath17 equipped with concatenation ; we use @xmath19 for the empty word .",
    "a positive group presentation is then a pair  @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a family of pairs of nonempty words in  @xmath18 , the relations of the presentation . as usual , we shall often write @xmath0 instead of @xmath20 for a relation . we denote by  @xmath21 the monoid associated with the presentation  @xmath3 , , the monoid  @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the smallest congruence on  @xmath18 that includes  @xmath4 .",
    "then , we denote by  @xmath24 the associated group : introducing for each letter  @xmath9 in  @xmath17 a disjoint copy  @xmath25 of  @xmath9 , and using  @xmath26 for the set of all  @xmath25 s , the group @xmath24 is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the smallest congruence on @xmath29 that includes  @xmath4 ( hence  @xmath23 ) and contains all pairs @xmath30 , @xmath31 , , all relations @xmath32 , for  @xmath9 in  @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath33 a word on  @xmath34 , we denote by  @xmath35 the word obtained from  @xmath33 by exchanging  @xmath9 and  @xmath25 everywhere and reversing the order of the letters : if @xmath33 represents  @xmath36 in  @xmath24 , then @xmath35 represents  @xmath37 .    in the previous framework , we reserve @xmath9 , @xmath10 for letters in  @xmath17 , and @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath38 for words in  @xmath18 .",
    "we use bold letters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath33 for words on the symmetrized alphabet  @xmath34 .",

    "an example of a ( maximal ) @xmath16-reversing sequence is @xmath78 .",
    "as the previous example shows , reversing is not a deterministic process in general : there can exist many ways of reversing one word .",

    "the purpose of our current study is to extend the results to the general case , , to non necessarily complemented presentations .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that this extension is not trivial and that the general case is actually the most convenient one , in particular because it forces us to carefully choose the right technical conditions whereas an additional superfluous hypotheses like complementedness left some misleading flexibility .",
    "it is convenient to associate with every @xmath15-reversing sequence @xmath49 a labelled planar graph as follows .",
    "first , we associate with  @xmath80 a path labelled with the successive letters of  @xmath80 : we associate to every positive letter  @xmath9 an horizontal right - oriented edge labelled  @xmath9 , and to every negative letter  @xmath25 a vertical down - oriented edge labelled  @xmath9 . then we by and by represent the words  @xmath81 , @xmath82 , as follows :",

    "however , in pratice , in particular when implementations are concerned , using  @xmath111 instead of  @xmath96 makes the verifications longer , as more transformations have to be considered .",
    "we establish now some general properties of ( right ) reversing .",

    "the main open question now is to determine to which extent word reversing can be used to prove results about the group  @xmath863 in the general case . in particular , it would be interesting to know whether reversing techniques can be used to study the possible embeddability of the monoid  @xmath21 in the group  @xmath863 .",
    "let us observe here that the presentation @xmath864 introduced in  @xcite is complete and it satisfies condition  @xmath718 , so the associated monoid is cancellative , but the latter does not embed in the corresponding group , as @xmath865 holds in the group ( we have there @xmath866 ) but not in the monoid ( we do not have @xmath867 ) .",
    "can this negative result be read directly on presentation  [ e : nemb ] ? similarly , but on the other direction , it is known that every artin monoid embeds in the corresponding group @xcite , but the remarkable proof of the result uses an indirect approach via a linear representation ( inspired by  @xcite ) .",
    "could reversing be used here ?",
    "we shall conclude this paper with a more precise question .",
    "assume that @xmath3 is a positive group presentation , and let @xmath868 denote the union of the relations  @xmath111 and  @xmath869 , , the extended @xmath15-reversing considered in remark  [ r : word ] and its left counterpart .",
    "[ p : dbrv ] tells us that , if @xmath3 is a complete presentation such that the monoid  @xmath21 is cancellative and admits common right multiples , then a word  @xmath33 represents  @xmath12 in the group  @xmath24 if and only if @xmath870 holds .",
    "if common multiples do not exist in  @xmath21 , the proof is no longer valid .",
    "however , the above result , namely that @xmath851 is equivalent to @xmath871 , also holds in the case of a free group , when @xmath4 is empty : in this case , reversing coincides with free reduction , and it is true that @xmath33 represents  @xmath12 in a free group if and only if it freely reduces to  @xmath19 ( with an unbounded number of alternations between @xmath15- and @xmath16-reversing , contrary to the case of prop .",
    "[ p : dbrv ] where one alternation is enough ) .",
    "similarly , in the case of presentation  , the key relation @xmath872 , which we have seen holds in the group but not in the monoid , can be proved using reversing , , @xmath873 holds , as we find @xmath874 ( with two alternations between @xmath15- and @xmath16-reversing ) .",
    "this leads to the general problem of whether the word problem of the group can be solved using reversing .",
    "simple counter - examples , such as the presentation @xmath875 suggested by s.  lee , show that some assumptions have to be satisfied , but the following question is open :    let @xmath3 be a complete presentation satisfying condition  @xmath718 ( so the monoid  @xmath876 is cancellative ) .",
    "is @xmath870 a necessary ( and sufficient ) condition for a word  @xmath33 on  @xmath877 to represent  @xmath12 in the group  @xmath878 ?",
    "a positive answer would imply that we can prove @xmath879 by introducing no new factor @xmath880 or @xmath116 , so , in some sense , by always going from one word to another that is not more complicated ( if not shorter , in general ) .",
    "in this sense , solutions for the word problem based on word reversing are reminiscent of dehn s algorithm for hyperbolic groups , but their range includes more complicated groups , such as braid groups , or , more generally , garside groups ( which admit a quadratic isoperimetric function ) , or even more complicated groups like the nilpotent heisenberg group ( which admits a cubic isoperimetric function ) . the underlying question is whether one can prove that a word  @xmath33 is trivial by remaining not too far from  @xmath33 in the cayley graph of the considered group ( a precise meaning was given in  @xcite ) , and reversing gives a positive answer for many particular groups . the general case is open , but we conjecture that completeness is relevant ."
