    "obviously @xmath26 whenever @xmath2 is highly transitive , but we do not know if the converse is true .",
    "yet another interesting question is whether there exists a reasonable classification of highly transitive groups ( or , more generally , groups of high transitivity degree ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to address these questions in certain geometric and algebraic settings .",
    "we begin by discussing known examples of highly transitive groups .",
    "trivial examples of such groups are @xmath27 ( the group of all finitary permutations of @xmath28 ) and the infinite alternating group @xmath29 ( the group of all finitary permutations that act as even permutations on their supports ) . clearly every subgroup of @xmath25 that contains @xmath29 is also highly transitive .",

    ", one can try to find a property of groups which can hold in a @xmath4-transitive group for any @xmath4 , but never holds for a highly transitive group .",
    "we wonder if satisfying a non - trivial mixed identity is such a property . in other words , we would like to know if every countable group with @xmath26 is mif .",
