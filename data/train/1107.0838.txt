    "@xcite developed a model ( referred to below as the jls model ) of financial bubbles and crashes , which is an extension of the rational expectation bubble model of blanchard and watson @xcite . in this model , a crash is seen as an event potentially terminating the run - up of a bubble .",
    "a financial bubble is modeled as a regime of accelerating ( super - exponential power law ) growth punctuated by short - lived corrections organized according to the symmetry of discrete scale invariance @xcite .",
    "the super - exponential power law is argued to result from positive feedback resulting from noise trader decisions that tend to enhance deviations from fundamental valuation in an accelerating spiral .",
    "the jls model has been proved to be a very powerful and flexible tool to detect financial bubbles and crashes in various kinds of markets such as the 2006 - 2008 oil bubble @xcite , the chinese index bubble in 2009 @xcite , the real estate market in las vegas @xcite , the south african stock market bubble @xcite and the us repurchase agreement market @xcite .",
    "recently , the jls model has been extended to detect market rebounds @xcite and to infer the fundamental market value hidden within observed prices @xcite .",
    "also , new experiments in ex - ante bubble detection and forecast has been performed in the financial crisis observatory at eth zurich @xcite .    here",
    ", we present an extension of the jls model , which is in the spirit of the approach developed by zhou and sornette @xcite to include additional pricing factors .    the literature on factor models is huge and we refer e.g. to ref.@xcite and references therein for a review of the literature .",
    "one of the most famous factor model , now considered as a standard benchmark , is the three - factor fama - french model @xcite augmented by the momentum factor @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of the zipf factor has been introduced @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the zipf factor is that , due to the concentration of the market portfolio when the distribution of the capitalization of firms is sufficiently heavy - tailed as is the case empirically , a risk factor generically appears in addition to the simple market factor , even for very large economies .",
    "malevergne et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple proxy for the zipf factor as the difference in returns between the equal - weighted and the value - weighted market portfolios .",
    "malevergne et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the resulting two - factor model ( market portfolio @xmath0 the new factor termed `` zipf factor '' ) is as successful empirically as the three - factor fama - french model .",
    "specifically , tests of the zipf model with size and book - to - market double - sorted portfolios as well as industry portfolios finds that the zipf model performs practically as well as the fama - french model in terms of the magnitude and significance of pricing errors and explanatory power , despite that it has only two factors instead of three .    in the present paper",
    ", we would like to introduce a new model by combining the zipf factor with the jls model .",
    "the new model keeps all the dynamical characteristics of a bubble described in the jls model .",
    "in addition , the new model can also provide the information about the concentration of stock gains over time from the knowledge of the zipf factor .",
    "this new information is very helpful to understand the risk diversification and to explain the investors behavior during the bubble generation .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the definition of the zipf factor as well as the new model .",
    "the derivation of the model is presented in this section and the appendix .",
    "section [ sec : calibration ] introduces the calibration method of this new model .",
    "then we test the new model with two famous chinese stock bubbles in the history in section [ sec : application ] and discuss the role of the zipf factor in these two bubbles .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "we introduce the new model in this section . our goal is to combine the zipf factor @xmath1 with the jls model of the bubble dynamics . to be specific , we introduce the following definition . +",
    "* definition 1 * : _ the zipf factor @xmath1 is defined as proportional to the difference between the returns of the capitalization - weighted portfolio and the equal - weighted portfolio for the last time step : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( respectively @xmath4 ) is the price of the capitalization - weighted ( respectively equal - weighted ) portfolio , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the weights of the portfolios are normalized so that their two prices are identical at the day preceding the beginning time @xmath7 of the time series : @xmath8 . _ + * definition 2 * : _ the integrated zipf factor @xmath9",
    "is obtained by taking the integral of the zipf factor defined by expression ( [ hjyjuj4u ] ) : @xmath10 _ _ _    by definition , the zipf factor describes the exposition to a lack of diversification due to the concentration of the stock market on a few very large firms .    the dynamics of stock markets during a bubble regime is then described as @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the portfolio price , @xmath12 is the drift ( or trend ) whose accelerated growth describes the presence of a bubble ( see below ) , @xmath13 is the factor loading on the zipf s factor and @xmath14 is the increment of a wiener process ( with zero mean and unit variance ) .",
    "the term @xmath15 represents a discontinuous jump such that @xmath16 before the crash and @xmath17 after the crash occurs . the loss amplitude associated with the occurrence of a crash",
    "is determined by the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the assumption of a constant jump size is easily relaxed by considering a distribution of jump sizes , with the condition that its first moment exists .",
    "then , the no - arbitrage condition is expressed similarly with @xmath18 replaced by its mean .",
    "each successive crash corresponds to a jump of @xmath15 by one unit .",
    "the dynamics of the jumps is governed by a crash hazard rate @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 is the probability that the crash occurs between @xmath21 and @xmath22 conditional on the fact that it has not yet happened , we have @xmath23   = 1 \\times h(t ) dt + 0 \\times ( 1- h(t ) dt)$ ] , where @xmath24 $ ] denotes the expectation operator .",
    "this leads to @xmath25 = h(t)dt~.    \\label{theyjytuj}\\ ] ]    noise traders exhibit collective herding behaviors that may destabilize the market in this model .",
    "we assume that the aggregate effect of noise traders can be accounted for by the following dynamics of the crash hazard rate @xmath26 the intuition behind this specification ( [ eq : hazard ] ) has been presented at length by johansen et al .",
    "@xcite , and further developed by sornette and johansen @xcite , ide and sornette @xcite and zhou and sornette @xcite . in a nutshell , the power law behavior @xmath27 embodies the mechanism of positive feedback posited to be at the source of the bubbles .",

    "of ( [ eq : hazard ] ) takes into account the existence of a possible hierarchical cascade of panic acceleration punctuating the course of the bubble , resulting either from a preexisting hierarchy in noise trader sizes @xcite and/or from the interplay between market price impact inertia and nonlinear fundamental value investing @xcite .",
    "we assume that all the investors of the market have already taken the diversification risk into account , so that the no - arbitrage condition reads @xmath30=0 $ ] , where the expectation is performed with respect to the risk - neutral measure , and in the frame of the risk - free rate .",
    "this is the condition that the price process concerning the diversification risk should be a martingale . taking the expectation of expression ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) under the filtration ( or history )",
    "until time @xmath21 reads @xmath31= \\mu(t ) dt + \\sigma(t )   { \\rm e}_t[dw ] - \\kappa { \\rm e}_t[dj]~.   \\label{thetyjye}\\ ] ] since @xmath32 = 0 $ ] and @xmath33 = h(t)dt$ ] ( equation ( [ theyjytuj ] ) ) , together with the no - arbitrage condition @xmath34=0 , \\forall t$ ] , this yields @xmath35 this result ( [ tjyj4n ] ) expresses that the return @xmath36 is controlled by the risk of the crash quantified by its crash hazard rate @xmath19 .",
    "the excess return @xmath37 is the remuneration that investors require to remain invested in the bubbly asset , which is exposed to a crash risk .",

    "this expression ( [ eq : lppl ] ) describes the average price dynamics only up to the end of the bubble . the same structure as equation ( [ eq : lppl ] ) is obtained using a stochastic discount factor following the derivation of zhou and sornette @xcite , as shown in the appendix .",
    "the jls model does not specify what happens beyond @xmath29 .",
    "this critical @xmath29 is the termination of the bubble regime and the transition time to another regime .",
    "this regime could be a big crash or a change of the growth rate of the market .",
    "merrill lynch emu ( european monetary union ) corporates non - financial index in 2009 @xcite provides a vivid example of a change of regime characterized by a change of growth rate rather than by a crash or rebound . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the crash hazard rate accelerates up to @xmath29 but its integral up to @xmath21 which controls the total probability for a crash to occur up to @xmath21 remains finite and less than @xmath44 for all times @xmath45 .",
    "it is this property that makes it rational for investors to remain invested knowing that a bubble is developing and that a crash is looming .",
    "indeed , there is still a finite probability that no crash will occur during the lifetime of the bubble .",
    "the condition that the price remains finite at all time , including @xmath29 , imposes that @xmath46 .    within the jls framework ,",
    "a bubble is qualified when the crash hazard rate accelerates . according to ( [ eq : hazard ] ) , this imposes @xmath28 and @xmath47 ,",
    "hence @xmath48 since @xmath46 by the condition that the price remains finite .",
    "we thus have a first condition for a bubble to occur @xmath49 by definition , the crash rate should be non - negative .",
    "this imposes @xcite @xmath50",

    "the other four ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are nonlinear parameters .",
    "we first slave the linear parameters to the nonlinear ones .",
    "the method here is the same as used by johansen et al . @xcite .",

    "the upper bound @xmath69 is large enough to catch high - frequency oscillations ( though we later discard fits with @xmath70 ) ; the phase @xmath54 should be between 0 and @xmath71 ; the predicted critical time @xmath29 should be after the end @xmath64 of the fitted time series .",
    "finally , the upper bound of the critical time @xmath29 should not be too far away from the end of the time series since predictive capacity degrades far beyond @xmath64 .",
    "jiang et al .",
    "@xcite have found empirically that a reasonable choice is to take the maximum horizon of predictability to extent to about one - third of the size of the fitted time window .",

    "<S> we present an extension of the johansen - ledoit - sornette ( jls ) model to include an additional pricing factor called the `` zipf factor '' , which describes the diversification risk of the stock market portfolio . </S>",
    "<S> keeping all the dynamical characteristics of a bubble described in the jls model , the new model provides additional information about the concentration of stock gains over time . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to understand better the risk diversification and to explain the investors behavior during the bubble generation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this new model to two famous chinese stock bubbles , from august 2006 to october 2007 ( bubble 1 ) and from october 2008 to august 2009 ( bubble 2 ) . the zipf factor is found highly significant for bubble 1 , corresponding to the fact that valuation gains were more concentrated on the large firms of the shanghai index . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the widespread acknowledgement of the 80 - 20 rule in the chinese media and discussion forums led many investors to discount the risk of a lack of diversification , therefore enhancing the role of the zipf factor . for bubble 2 </S>",
    "<S> , the zipf factor is found marginally relevant , suggesting a larger weight of market gains on small firms . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this result as the consequence of the response of the chinese economy to the very large stimulus provided by the chinese government in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis . </S>"
