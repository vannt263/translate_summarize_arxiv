    "spin coherent states are well known in the literature @xcite , where their primary purpose is for constructing the spin coherent state path integral . here",
    "we introduce them in a way that is useful for our purposes , and we briefly state their properties .",
    "the reader should not be daunted by the math , which is presented here for completeness but is unnecessary for conceptual understanding . for convenience",
    "we will set @xmath9 .",
    "consider a spin with a fixed total angular momentum quantum number @xmath10 .",
    "the usual arguments show that the eigenstates of @xmath11-angular momentum , @xmath2 , form a ladder with @xmath12 .",
    "the state with maximal @xmath11-angular momentum is @xmath13 . since @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we see that @xmath13 is an eigenstate of the _ vector _ spin operator in the sense that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unit vector in the @xmath11 direction",
    ". now , let @xmath18 be a vector of length @xmath19 and direction @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 in spherical polars and @xmath22 in cartesians . define the _ spin coherent state _",
    "@xmath23 as the state obtained by rotating @xmath13 counterclockwise by angle @xmath24 about the @xmath25 axis , and then by angle @xmath26 about the @xmath11 axis : @xmath27 using the wigner @xmath28-matrix @xcite , we may write @xmath23 explicitly as a linear combination of @xmath2 states : @xmath29    from the properties of spin operators it can be shown that eqs .   and give @xmath30 in other words , the spin coherent state @xmath23 is an eigenstate of the _ vector _ spin operator with _ vector _",
    "eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "from here it is easy to show that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and that the spin coherent states are normalized as @xmath33",
    "from eq .   we see that @xmath34 we define the `` spin wavefunction '' of a spin state @xmath2 as the `` coefficients '' of @xmath2 in the basis of spin coherent states @xmath35 , including a normalization factor : @xmath36 for comparison , we also define `` orbital wavefunctions '' as the orbital angular momentum eigenfunctions for integer @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these are the well - known spherical harmonics@xcite , which can be written in terms of associated legendre functions @xmath39 : @xmath40 with these definitions , both types of wavefunctions are normalized such that @xmath41 the spin wavefunction and orbital wavefunction have the same @xmath26 dependence , but the @xmath24 dependence is different .",
    "the relationship between the two representations is vaguely reminiscent of the duality between position and momentum .",
    "we will borrow geographical techniques for visualizing functions over the surface of a sphere .",
    "in particular , we will use the hammer projection@xcite , which is an equal - area cartographic projection that maps the entire surface of the earth ( or any sphere ) to the interior of an ellipse of semiaxes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this may be thought of as making a cut along the `` international dateline '' ( the meridian @xmath44 , so that the cut sphere is topologically equivalent to a flat sheet , and flattening the resulting shape into an ellipse . the hammer projection is described mathematically by the following transformations between @xmath20 and @xmath45 : @xmath46    ) and meridians ( lines of constant @xmath47 according to the hammer projection , which maps an entire spherical surface to a flat ellipse .",
    "[ hammerfigure ] ]    let us now compare spin and orbital wavefunctions for various states .",
    "first consider the state of maximal @xmath11-angular momentum , @xmath13 .",
    "the orbital wavefunction is @xmath48 ( fig .  [ y99 ] ) .",
    "this represents travelling waves going around the equator of the sphere , which jives with the heuristic classical picture of a particle orbiting in a horizontal circle .",
    "the orbital wavefunction is the probability amplitude for finding the particle at a position @xmath49 .",
    "the spin wavefunction is @xmath50 ( fig .  [ f99 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath13 is identical to the spin coherent state @xmath51 with @xmath52 , we might have expected that the spin wavefunction would be a dirac delta function of the form @xmath53 . however , because spin coherent states form an overcomplete non - orthonormal basis , the spin wavefunction is actually a smooth function with maximum amplitude near the north pole ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of a semiclassical spin vector that points toward the north pole on average , but undergoes quantum fluctuations away from this direction .",
    "larger values of @xmath19 lead to smaller quantum fluctuations .    now consider the state @xmath55 .",
    "the orbital wavefunction is @xmath56 ( fig .  [ y90 ] ) , where @xmath57 is a legendre polynomial .",
    "this state has total angular momentum @xmath19 , but its average @xmath11-angular momentum is zero .",
    "classically , this suggests that the angular momentum vector @xmath58 lies in the @xmath59 plane and that a particle executes circular orbits in a vertical plane perpendicular to @xmath58 .",
    "quantum mechanically , there are standing waves formed by the interference of northbound and southbound waves along every meridian .",
    "the spin wavefunction is @xmath60 ( fig .  [ f90 ] ) .",
    "the plot can be understood as the distribution of a semiclassical spin whose quantum fluctuations allow it to explore the whole equator , as well as making excursions toward the `` tropics '' .",
    "this is an improvement over the textbook picture ( fig .",
    "[ spincartoon ] ) .",
    "it is mathematically precise , and it captures extra nuances : not only does the spin precess in a circle due to quantum fluctuations , its `` latitude '' also fluctuates .    finally , consider @xmath61 as an example of a generic state .",
    "for this state the orbital wavefunction ( fig .",
    "[ y96 ] ) consists of travelling waves along several latitudes , whereas the spin wavefunction ( fig .  [ f96 ] ) is concentrated near a single latitude .",
    "this latitude corresponds to a vertical position @xmath38 on a sphere of radius @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the orbital wavefunction @xmath65 is only meaningful when @xmath37 and @xmath38 are integers .",
    "if @xmath37 is a half - integer , @xmath65 diverges at the poles and is generallly non - normalizable , due to the legendre functions in eq .  .",
    "in contrast , the spin wavefunction @xmath66 is well - defined even for half - integer values of @xmath19 and @xmath38 , as can be seen from eq .   and fig .",
    "[ yandftable ] .",
    "this is the key advantage of spin wavefunctions .",
    "a careful reader will notice that if @xmath19 is a half - integer , the function @xmath5 is discontinuous at the `` international dateline '' @xmath67 : upon crossing this branch cut , the spin wavefunction changes by a factor of @xmath68 .",
    "this is not a bug , but a feature !",
    "it illustrates the peculiar nature of spinor rotation : rotation by @xmath8 gives a factor of @xmath68 , and a spinor is only invariant under a full @xmath69 rotation .",
    "so far we have considered `` spin wavefunctions '' for spin angular momentum eigenstates @xmath2 .",
    "now let us consider the spin wavefunction for a spin coherent state @xmath70 : @xmath71 although the form of eq",
    ".   is not illuminating , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fscs ] show that the `` spin wavefunction '' @xmath72 has largest magnitude near @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as one would expect .",
    "the `` spread '' in the wavefunction is inversely proportional to @xmath19 , so that the limit @xmath75 is indeed the semiclassical limit .",
    "a spin in a constant magnetic field @xmath76 obeys the hamiltonian @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is a gyromagnetic ratio)@xcite .",
    "ehrenfest s theorem shows that the average spin precesses around the direction of @xmath76 at the larmor frequency @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that if the initial state is a spin coherent state , @xmath23 , then the state at a later time @xmath80 is also a spin coherent state with a rotated vector @xmath81 as well as a phase factor .",
    "this implies that larmor precession can be visualized in the classroom by animating the time - dependent spin wavefunction @xmath82 .",
    "successive frames in such an animation might look like fig .",
    "it is well known that the orbital wavefunctions for @xmath0 states , which are the spherical harmonics @xmath1 , are polynomials in @xmath83 , @xmath25 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "[ fsmformula ] , it can be shown that the spin wavefunctions for @xmath2 states , @xmath5 , are square roots of rational functions in @xmath83 , @xmath25 , and @xmath11 : @xmath87 the spin wavefunctions for coherent states @xmath88 can be expressed in a similar form : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 correspond to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the sum can be written in closed form in terms of hypergeometric functions , but this is not illuminating .",
    "the spin coherent states form a massively overcomplete non - orthonormal basis .",
    "thus , the spin wavefunction @xmath95 contains a large amount of redundant information .",
    "however , we conjecture that the @xmath5 for _ all _ @xmath7 and @xmath96 may form a complete , non - redundant basis for functions on the sphere , just like the @xmath1 .",
    "if this is true , it would allow an _",
    "arbitrary _ wavefunction to be expanded as @xmath97 .",
    "we are not aware whether this has been proven . at the time of writing it",
    "is also unclear whether the time - dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath98 can be written down in differential form , or if it is inherently an integrodifferential equation .",
    "measurement - induced collapse of the `` spin wavefunction '' can certainly be discussed within our picture , although this may not serve a useful pedagogical purpose .",
    "we have developed the concept of the `` spin wavefunction '' for spin-@xmath19 spins , using the basis of spin coherent states .",
    "this works for both integer and half - integer values of @xmath19 .",
    "we provide explicit formulas and striking visualizations of spin eigenstates @xmath2 , spin coherent states @xmath23 , and larmor precession .",
    "we also demonstrate that cartographic projections such as the hammer projection are useful for visualizing wavefunctions defined on spherical surfaces .",
    "students bring a variety of learning styles to the classroom @xcite .",
    "some take well to a deductive approach going from general theorems to specific phenomena , whereas others prefer an inductive approach starting with concrete examples .",
    "we feel that the spin wavefunction visualizations presented here will be very useful for reaching out to the latter class of students ."
