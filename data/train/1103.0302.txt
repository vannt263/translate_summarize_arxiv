    "following the publication of the mhd reconnection scenario of sweet and parker @xcite , petschek @xcite noted that a pair of back - to - back slow shocks bounding the reconnection outflow could significantly raise the efficiency of the process by acting as a transition between the inflowing and reconnected outflowing plasma .",
    "ion heating by these petschek - reconnection - associated slow shocks is one of the mechanisms that has been proposed for solar flares @xcite and the solar wind .",
    "however , although in - situ observations of slow shocks in the solar wind exist @xcite , they are relatively rare , suggesting that the mhd picture of petschek may not tell the complete story .",
    "unanswered questions remain concerning the kinetic structure of such shocks in a collisionless plasma and the associated mechanisms leading to particle heating . in previous work ,",
    "kinetic slow shocks were studied numerically in hybrid codes by initializing the system with the slow shock jumps predicted by mhd @xcite or , later , by the piston @xcite and flow - flow methods @xcite . some of the main focuses of these works were the backstreaming beam - driven electromagnetic ion - ion cyclotron instability ( emiic ) @xcite , which has been suggested to be the cause of the nonsteady behavior of slow shocks , and the formation and damping of downstream large amplitude dispersive wavetrains @xcite .",
    "recently , the dissipation due to electrons and beam - excited kinetic alfvn waves was studied by the piston method in particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite .    in pic simulations of reconnection , the plasma downstream of the x - line exhibits large firehose - sense ( @xmath0 ) temperature anisotropies , as shown in fig .",

    "( c ) , we see turbulence in the @xmath5 component correlated with the unstable firehose region ; a cut of the firehose stability parameter @xmath6 at @xmath7 is shown in ( d ) .",
    "the firehose - sense temperature anisotropy is notable since in - situ observations of the solar wind clearly show that the proton temperature anisotropy is bounded by the marginal firehose and mirror mode stability boundaries @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of interest to more closely study the temperature anisotropy distribution across the reconnection exhaust far downstream from the reconnection site , in order to understand the effect of the self - generated temperature anisotropy on the propagation and steepening of the slow shock .",
    "the petschek theory of reconnection @xcite predicts that the reconnection exhaust will be bounded by a back - to - back pair of standing switch - off slow shocks .",
    "however , no clear signature of petscheck shocks has been seen in pic reconnection simulations , such as in fig .",
    "[ lo_reconn ] @xcite , or hybrid simulations @xcite .",
    "this may be due to the relatively small domain sizes in the shock normal direction ( @xmath8 in fig .",

    "this set - up more closely resembles the reconnection outflow exhaust than that produced by other methods of generating shocks .",

    "the amplitude eventually drops to the value of @xmath5 ( i.e. , the tangential magnetic field vanishes ) in the center , as the symmetry of the initial conditions demands .",
    "the coplanar transition is recognizable as a slow shock transition , where the major enhancements of the temperatures , pressures , densities and decrease in @xmath100 occur .",
    "a similar step - like decrease in @xmath100 due to a slow shock was also noted in the downstream of a large - scale hybrid reconnection simulation @xcite .",

    "the energy source of the downstream outflow is the difference in the tangential component of the magnetic field across the discontinuity .",
    "if we jump to the outflow frame ( the de hoffmann - teller frame ) , there will be inflowing alfvnic streaming ion beams from both discontinuities along the downstream magnetic field as observed by gosling in the solar wind @xcite and in kinetic reconnection simulations @xcite .",
    "these counter - streaming ions cause an enhancement in the downstream parallel ion temperature and , therefore , the temperature anisotropy .    in the phase space of the @xmath65 case at time @xmath84 ( see fig .",
    "[ lo_phase ] ) a signature of the counter - streaming beams is not obvious in the downstream region ( since the ion distribution does not peak in the upper and lower parts of a single wave oscillation ) , perhaps because of the large - amplitude rotational wave .",

    "when the obliquity is large enough , especially when @xmath108 , the downstream magnetic field rotates into the out - of - plane direction and becomes turbulent .",

    "when the wavelength of the primary lh wave is large , as in the @xmath109 case , its front part breaks into finer right - handed ( rh ) waves with scale @xmath110 . in the @xmath65 case ,",
    "the scale of the primary lh wave is already as small as @xmath111 , and so it is more stable than the @xmath60 case , albeit still turbulent .",

    "[ lo_degrees ] are the predicted @xmath98 structure from mhd theory @xcite .",
    "the overall predictions agree well for the oblique cases ( see , for instance , the upstream @xmath98 of the slow shocks in the @xmath60 and @xmath65 cases ) , although the reflected weak fast rarefactions from our boundary have caused a discrepancy in the slow shock upstream @xmath98 for the @xmath73 case . in less oblique cases ,",
    "the intermediate and fast characteristic speeds approach one another just upstream of the switch - off slow shock according to mhd theory .",
    "therefore there is no clear separation between the slow shocks upstream and the fast rarefactions , as can be seen in the simulations .",
    "we treat the place where the inflow speed @xmath112 ( not shown ) starts to decrease as the upstream of the slow shocks , which corresponds to the beginning of the lh rotational wavetrains in the @xmath52 and @xmath56 cases .",
    "their upstream will hence correspond to @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively .",
    "therefore the stable small amplitude rotational waves in the @xmath115 and @xmath56 cases are more similar to the conventional dispersive stationary downstream wavetrains , which immediately follow the slow shock upstream .",
    "( we note that the model in lin and lee @xcite approximates the rarefactions by replacing the energy jump condition in the rankine - hugoniot relations by @xmath116=0 $ ] , arguing that the entropy across a weak rarefaction does not change .",
    "this is only valid for weak rarefaction waves , but the overall tendency as the propagation angle becomes more parallel should be in the correct sense ) .",
    "an interesting feature in the oblique cases is the coincidence between the start of the primary lh magnetic rotation and the location where the anisotropy parameter @xmath117 .",

    "the following questions naturally arise .",
    "if the rotational wave is really a normal dispersive wavetrain , why does it appear in the middle of the mhd predicted switch - off slow shocks ?",
    "why do the dispersive waves not start directly from the slow shock upstream ?",

    ", @xmath123 represents a transition where the slow and intermediate mode speeds become degenerate . unlike the conventional picture , the downstream rotational waves can not then be explained by slow dispersive waves , but instead take the form of rotational intermediate modes .",

    "although a firehose - sense temperature anisotropy ( @xmath169 ) would weaken the nonlinearity , the spatial variation of @xmath2 enhances the nonlinearity , as will be shown in the follow - up paper @xcite .    runs @xmath157 and @xmath158 suggest that temperature anisotropy and alfvnic beams are not , by themselves , sufficient for generating the small - scale waves seen in the downstream region .",
    "the time scale of the wave - generation is faster than beam / anisotropy driven waves from the electromagnetic ion - ion cyclotron instability ( emiic ) , such as alfvn / ion cyclotron ( aic ) waves @xcite , or kinetic - alfvn waves ( kaw)@xcite . as is the case for the growth rate of the firehose instability @xmath170 @xcite , the growth rate is small when @xmath171 ( based on the ambient b field ) is small .",

    "this suggests that the primary rotational front propagates at the local intermediate speed ( as also measured in the simulations ) . we do not address which modes are responsible for these fine - scale waves here , since the polarization of the linear mode in kinetic theory is very complicated",

    "compared to slow shocks , fast shocks have been intensively studied ( see , for instance , a review article @xcite ) . the formation of shocklet and short large - amplitude magnetic structures ( slams ) in front of earth s quasi - parallel bow shock has been observed @xcite and simulated @xcite . in our slow shock simulations ,",
