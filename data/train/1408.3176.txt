    "[ fig : hrmethods]*b * indicates the huang - rhys ( hr ) factors of secondary bath oscillators with nearest - neighbor couplings in a chain , that are obtained from different methods .",
    "the hr factor @xmath41 of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath42 is a normalized coupling strength given by @xmath43 . for the secondary modes ,",
    "hr factors are defined with the frequencies of the oscillators and the coupling strengths with the nearest neighbors in the chain . as",
    "one compares the results from bulla s method ( green cross ) and bulla s method with ep ( blue triangle ) , they are significantly different from each other .",
    "this shows that bulla s recursion relation is numerically unstable . comparing the bulla s and gsh methods",
    ", one can see the bulla s method ( green cross ) produces larger hr factors than the gsh method ( red circle ) .",
    "the gsh bath transformation can produce oscillators with frequencies distributed a narrower band .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the unitary transformation for the chain model is not unique .",
    "bulla s method does not allow the secondary bath modes to have negative interactions while the gsh has no such a constraint . since the unitary matrix for the gsh transform is constructed via orthogonalization of the random vectors , the signs of the interactions in a single chain can vary in each transformation , but their magnitudes are invariant .",
    "in this subsection , we apply the gsh transformation method to a couple of illustrative examples .",
    "first , to get some insights into the weakly - coupled multiple chain model , we employ this method analytically to transform a bath with two oscillator modes .",
    "then , we continue with a multidimensional example of a chlorosome . in the chain bath model for two oscillators ,",
    "the mixing of the two modes with frequencies @xmath44 leads to a hr factor for the primary mode @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : twodimhr ] , the normalized hr factor @xmath49 of eq .",
    "[ eq : rhr ] is plotted while varying the frequency ratio ( @xmath50 ) at fixed coupling strength ratios @xmath51 , 0.5 , 1 and 2 . for",
    "fixed @xmath51 , the values of @xmath49 decrease as the frequency ratio increases .",
    "@xmath51 determines the slopes of the curves .",
    "larger @xmath51 makes the curve decrease faster as @xmath50 increases .",
    "when the oscillators have similar frequencies @xmath52 , @xmath49 is larger than 1 , which makes the chain bath couplings stronger than the star - bath model .",
    "however , as the frequency ratio increases @xmath49 drops down and it can become arbitrarily small as the frequency difference increases .",
    "this gives a hint how to mix the oscillator modes and reduce the coupling strength of the primary modes by forming weakly coupled multiple chains .",
    "the oscillators , which have large frequency differences , should be mixed to make the weakly coupled multiple chain bath models .",
    "next , we apply the gsh method to the example of chlorosome .",
    "the sp approach divides the bath oscillators into a sequence of groups of oscillators , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chlspd]*a * using a different color for each group . fig .",
    "[ fig : chlspd]*b * represents the lp scheme , where only the peaks below 500 @xmath40 are shown for the clarity . as indicated here , the oscillators are partitioned into 6 groups to use the lp scheme . in the lp scheme ,",
    "the elements of the @xmath53-th group are composed of @xmath54-th ( @xmath55 ) modes , where @xmath56 is the number of groups , @xmath57 is an integer ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 is the total number of oscillators .",
    "for example , when one has 10 modes and 3 groups to partition , the sp approach groups modes of ( 1,2,3 ) , ( 4,5,6 ) and ( 7,8,9,10 ) as group 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in the other hand , the lp strategy does the partition into ( 1,4,7,10 ) , ( 2,5,8 ) and ( 3,6,9 ) for group 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numofchains ] , the maximum hr factor and the corresponding coupling strength of the primary modes are plotted by varying the number of chains from 1 to 6 .",
    "the lp and sp schemes are used for this calculation .",
    "the maximum hr factor of the star - bath model is 0.0315 .",
    "the single chain model has even larger hr factor of the primary mode than the star - bath model for both partitioning schemes .",
    "the maximum hr factors from the sp scheme ( blue cross ) do not decrease as the number of chains increases .",
    "the figure shows , however , that the maximum hr factor ( black circle ) and the corresponding coupling strength ( red triangle ) decrease as the number of chains increases for the lp scheme .",
    "the maximum hr factor from the lp scheme with 6 chains is below 0.01 , which corresponds to 10% of the corresponding harmonic frequency .",
    "therefore 6 chains make the chain model suitable for implementation on quantum simulators , since a quantum simulator can have only a few parallel chains and , in addition , the primary mode hr factor is limited . in principle , the values can be reduced further as long as mixing modes is still possible . the lp and sp schemes",
    "are further compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : parchains ] .",
    "this plot shows the hr factor of the primary modes of each chain .",
    "the results are indicated in blue crosses and black circles for the sp and lp schemes , respectively . as evidenced by the figure",
    ", the lp scheme gives all values below 0.01 while the sp strategy produce bigger values and the maximum value is more than 4 times larger than the lp values .",
    "another important aspect of the lp scheme is that all of the primary hr factors have nearly similar values while the results of the sp scheme deviate largely from each other .",
    "in this paper we show that a multiple chain - bath model , in combination with the leaping bath partitioning scheme , may lead to a practical implementation of quantum simulators for complex open quantum dynamics .",
    "we have shown that the multiple chain - bath model can be employed for the realization of quantum simulators for open quantum systems or for numerical studies in classical computers .",
    "furthermore , the leaping partition scheme can reduce the primary mode coupling strength almost homogeneously for all parallel chains .",
    "the reason is that the mixing of oscillators with large frequency differences can result in small hr factors .",
    "the two - oscillator model was presented with an analytic expression for the chain transformation and provides a hint for the bath partitioning scheme , _",
    "i.e. _ leaping partition .",
    "we also tested the unitary transformation algorithm that exploits the gsh transformation , and compared the results with the values from bulla s recursion method  @xcite .",
    "the gsh transformation can produce smaller hr factors of the secondary bath modes with oscillators being in a narrower band .",
