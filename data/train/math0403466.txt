    "since the publication of box and jenkins book @xcite , the statistical methodology proposed by these authors has been disseminated and widely used to build mathematical models of time series .",
    "these models are essentially discrete time differential equations ( thus , indeed difference equations ) , of which the order and the parameters ( supposed constant ) are determined as a function only of a unique sample of its output sequence - the time series - which is considered as a particular realization of a gaussian stochastic process resulting from a forced term ( the input of the system ) which is also considered as an unobservable gaussian process .",
    "the orders p of the difference equation and q of the input noise are identified with the aid of correlation and partial correlation functions .    in the beginning of the 80 s , tiao and tsay @xcite , of the statistics department of wisconsin university ,",
    "proposed a methodology analogous to box and jenkin s to the multivariate case , that is , the one in which several time series are treated simultaneously , being viewed as a vector time series .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the separate treatment of the series would not take in consideration their interrelations , which otherwise would allow the building of a model of greater predictive capacity .",
    "the proposed methodology is based upon a direct generalization of the correlation and partial correlation functions , to identify the orders p and q of the model .",
    "it happens , nevertheless , that there is not a method to determine isolately the orders p and q of a multivariate arma(p , q )  model nor is it possible to come up with one , simply because , contrarily to the univariate case , a multivariate arma model has not independent intrinsic p and q orders .",
    "this will be shown using the polynomial representation of linear systems and unimodular matrices .",
    "the necessary correction is also proposed , with  the introduction of the arma(p , p)-irreducible models . given the formal resemblance between this new class of models and the class of linear systems of a common mcmillan degree , a natural question is if this new class also constitutes a differentiable manifold .",
    "if this was the case , a whole new set of parametrizations would be unveiled , as it happened with the so - called overlapping parametrizations .",
    "since the space of all linear dynamical systems with a common mcmillan degree and the generic set in the arma(p , p)-irreducible class are differentiable manifolds , it makes sense to be able to do _",
    "identification on a manifold _",
    "( see references @xcite and @xcite for the basic results on this area ) .",
    "the resulting path in the systems space until convergence will be almost independent of the parametrization @xcite .",
    "this could be termed _ coordinate - free identification . _    to use this approach , the riemannian metric tensor g must be computed , since the riemannian gradient is given by g@xmath0j , that is , g@xmath1 times the gradient of a convenient objective function j. furthermore , the local geometric properties of the manifold are defined by g and , as a consequence , some of its global properties too , like for instance the geodesics equations , which are obtained by the integration of a set of partial differential equations based upon g.    in @xcite , pp.149 - 155 ,  a recipe is given for the obtention of g. it consists on a formula for the norm of tangent vectors ( which are systems derivatives ) as a function of the matrices of a state space representation , needing the solution of a lyapunov equation ; this norm takes straightforwardly to the metric tensor .",
    "identification algorithms which require the solution of lyapunov or riccati equations are common in the literature .    here",
    "a formula for the metric tensor is obtained , which gives it directly as a functional of the system s transfer function .",
    "the generality of that formula enables the use of any representation besides state space ( at least two other ones are known : arma and matrix pencil @xcite ) and does nt require the solution of lyapunov or riccati equations .",
    "particularized formulas for arma and state space representations are obtained , using overlapping parametrizations .",

    "thus , cancelling all the common factors of a(z ) and b(z ) , an arma(p*,q * ) with p * and q * minimal is obtained .",
    "it is obvious that any increase or reduction in p has , necessarily , to be accompanied by the same increase or reduction in q , since increases or reductions require adding or cancelling of common factors in the fraction h(z ) .",
    "the conclusion is that , in the scalar case , p * and q * are individually invariant , that is , given a system , it makes sense to refer to _ the _ order p * of its ar part and _ the _ order q * of its ma part and trying to identify them .    in the vector case , nevertheless , this is not true . in this case , the transfer function is    @xmath17    if a(z)=p(z)c(z ) and b(z)=p(z)d(z ) , with p , c e d matrix polynomials , then    @xmath55    now , c = p@xmath56 and d = p@xmath57 if c and d are to be polynomial ( so that cy = d@xmath58 be an arma model ) , it is necessary that all elements of a and b be divisible by detp ( since p@xmath59 let d(z ) be the maximum common divisor of elements of a e b. define @xmath60    where i is the identity matrix .",

    "there remain arbitrary unimodular matrices , which , once discounted , do alter the ar and ma degrees of the equation .",

    "then , multiplying the arma(0,q ) equation above by h(z)@xmath1 , an arma(q,0 ) equation is obtained :    @xmath74    thus , there are two pairs , ( 0,q ) and ( q,0 ) , of minimal orders ( because nor p nor q can be smaller then zero ) corresponding to the same system . hannan and deistler ( @xcite , pg .",
