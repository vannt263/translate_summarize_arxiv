    "in the past forty years there has been a lot of progress in the study of many non - linear pdes which model the propagation of waves . in this class of equations",
    "we can mention for instance the non - linear wave ( nlw ) equation , the euler equations of hydrodynamics and various models deriving from it such as the non - linear schrdinger ( nls ) the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) , the camassa - holm equations and many others .",
    "a particularly fruitful research line has been the so - called `` dynamical systems approach '' i.e. the generalisation to infinite dimensional setting of many ideas and techniques borrowed from the theory of dynamical systems ; the key idea is to look for invariant manifolds on which the dynamics is particularly simple and then try to obtain some stability result in order to deduce some properties for typical initial data on the whole phase space .",
    "the behaviour of the solutions is expected to depend strongly on the set in which the `` space variable '' lives ; in this paper we will concentrate on the case of a compact riemannian manifold @xmath2 , where one expects a `` recurrent dynamics '' and complicated coexistence of regular and chaotic phenomena . in particular",
    "we shall focus on the problem of existence and stability of quasi - periodic solutions and , as an example , we will study a forced nls equation @xmath3 here and henceforth @xmath4 denotes the laplace - beltrami operator , @xmath5 is the  mass \" , the parameter @xmath6 is small , and the frequency vector is @xmath7 .",
    "concerning regularity we assume that @xmath8 in the real sense ( namely as a function of @xmath9 ) , for some @xmath10 large enough .",
    "we will describe an existence result of quasi - periodic solutions for equation above when @xmath11 is a homogeneous space w.r.t . a compact lie group ( see theorem [ teoremone ] ) .",
    "then we shall restrict our attention to the case of @xmath0 or @xmath1 and prove a linear stability result ( see theorem [ thm.reduci ] ) . in section [ salaminchia ]",
    "we discuss the extension to spherical varieties of rank one .    _",
    "the newton scheme .",
    "_ passing to the fourier representation for the space variables , namely @xmath12 where @xmath13 runs in a countable index set and the @xmath14 s are the eigenfunctions of @xmath15 , can be seen as an infinite dimensional forced dynamical system which has an elliptic fixed point at @xmath16 .",
    "a very natural question is whether there are solutions which synchronise with the forcing , provided that the forcing frequency @xmath17 is sufficiently non - resonant w.r.t .",
    "the linear frequencies , i.e. the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath15 .",

    ", one reduces the search for quasi - periodic solutions to to an implicit function problem @xmath18 and may try to solve it by perturbation theory ; however the linearised operator at @xmath16 is @xmath19 and its inverse is unbounded so that one can not apply the implicit function theorem : this is known as the `` small divisor problem '' .    in order to handle this , one typically uses a recursive newton - like scheme , which is based on the invertibility of the equation linearised at a sequence of _ approximate solutions _",

    "$ ] , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] .2truecm    this in turn can be seen as a `` non - resonance '' condition on the frequency @xmath17 : indeed one can produce an abstract `` nash - moser '' scheme ( see for instance @xcite ) which says that if @xmath17 is such that at each step @xmath21 of the scheme the operator @xmath22 is well - defined and bounded from @xmath23 to @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , then a solution of exists",
    ". then the problem reduces to proving that such set of parameters @xmath17 is non - empty , or even better that it has asymptotically full measure .",
    "if we impose some symmetry such as a hamiltonian structure , the linearised operator @xmath26 is self - adjoint and it is easy to obtain some information on its eigenvalues , implying its invertibility with bounds on the @xmath27-norm of the inverse for  most \" parameters @xmath28 .",
    "however this information is not enough to prove the convergence of the algorithm : one needs estimates on the high sobolev norm of the inverse , which do not follow only from bounds on the eigenvalues .",
    "naturally , if @xmath26 were diagonal , passing from @xmath27 to @xmath29 norm would be trivial , but the problem is that the operator which diagonalises @xmath26 may not be bounded in @xmath29 .",
    "the property of an operator to be diagonalisable via a `` smooth '' change of variables is known as _",
    "reducibility _ and in general is connected to the fact that the matrix is regular semi - simple , namely its eigenvalues are distinct .",
    "when dealing with infinite dimensional matrices , one also has to give quantitative estimates on the difference between two eigenvalues : this is usually referred to as the _ second order melnikov condition _ , since it can be seen as a condition on @xmath17 .",
    "however in general this condition can not be imposed because the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are multiple and actually have unbounded multiplicity .",
    "naturally one does not need to diagonalise a matrix in order to invert it , and indeed there are various existence results which have been proved in the case of multiple eigenvalues ; however , this tends to be technically quite complicated and needs a deep understanding of the harmonic analysis on the manifold @xmath2 .    _",
    "some literature .",
    "_ the first existence ( and stability ) results dealt with autonomous hamiltonian pdes and were obtained by kuksin @xcite , pschel @xcite , wayne @xcite who studied the nls and nlw equations on the interval @xmath30 $ ] where the eigenvalues of @xmath15 are simple and one can easily impose the second order melnikov conditions .",
    "thanks to this diagonalisation procedure , they were able to obtain some information on the linear stability : in particular they showed that the eigenvalues are purely imaginary .",
    "their approach was an infinite dimensional generalisation of the classical kam algorithm for elliptic tori ( see for instance @xcite ) .    since these results dealt with autonomous equations , another problem was the so - called _ frequency modulation _",
    ", namely the fact that there are no external parameters on which to impose the non - resonance conditions and one needs to `` extract them '' from the nonlinearity , in general by means of birkhoff normal form .",
    "later on , these kam techniques were further generalised by chierchia - you to the case of nlw with multiple eigenvalues but with bounded multiplicity , for instance when @xmath11 is the unit circle @xmath31 .",
    "a more direct approach was proposed by craig - wayne @xcite , who dealt with an analytic setting ; they used a lyapunov - schmidt decomposition in order to `` extract the parameters '' and a newton scheme to solve the small divisor problem . in order to get the needed estimates on @xmath32 ( also called _ green function estimates _ by analogy with the anderson localisation problem ) they developed a technique inspired by the methods of frlich - spencer @xcite",
    "however their result was limited to the case of periodic solutions .",
    "this set of techniques was extended to the case of quasi - periodic solutions by bourgain @xcite who was able to deal also with the case @xmath33 .",
    "then berti - bolle @xcite were able to generalise bourgain s techniques to the case of sobolev regularity , considering also a multiplicative potential ( the previous results dealt with a simplified model where the potential is non - local ) .",
    "the reason why these results are confined to tori is that their proofs require specific properties of the eigenvalues , while the eigenfunctions must be the exponentials or , at least , strongly ",
    "localised close to exponentials \" . in the paper @xcite berti - procesi",
    "proved existence of periodic solutions for nlw and nls on any compact lie group or manifold homogenous with respect to a compact lie group and finally berti - corsi - procesi @xcite extended this result to the case of quasi - periodic solutions .",
    "note that all these results obtained via newton method do not give any information on the linear stability of the solution , which is a completely non - trivial problem since the second order melnikov condition is obviously violated already on @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the first reducibility results on @xmath34 with @xmath36 are due to eliasson - kuksin @xcite who were able to prove linear stability of the quasi - periodic solutions of nls .",
    "the main ingredients of their proofs are the following : first they reduce to a time - independent block diagonal matrix and then they impose the second order melnikov condition between the eigenvalues of different blocks . in order to show that the set of parameters has positive measure they need to study carefully the asymptotics of the eigenvalues ( the so called tplitz - lipschitz condition ) .",
    "we mention also the papers @xcite which make use of the conservation of momentum in order to fully diagonalise the matrix .",
    "very recently a combination of the two approaches has been developed by baldi - berti - montalto @xcite in order to prove existence and stability for fully non - linear perturbations of the kdv equation ; see also @xcite for the case of the nls equation .",
    "we believe that this latter approach may be very fruitful since it decouples completely the existence and reducibility problems ; note however that the strategy used so far in order to deal with unbounded perturbations works only in one - dimensional cases .    in this paper , for @xmath37 , we shall prove by means of a kam reducibility scheme the linear stability of the quasi - periodic solutions whose existence has been proved in @xcite in a more general and abstract setting . at a formal level",
    "a kam reducibility scheme starts with a matrix @xmath38 of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is diagonal with distinct eigenvalues and @xmath41 is bounded in some appropriate norm .",
    "then one step of the scheme provides a change of variables which conjugates @xmath38 to @xmath42 where again @xmath43 is diagonal and @xmath44 bounded .",
    "iterating this procedure one diagonalises the matrix . in our case",
    "we diagonalise the operator linearised along the solution via a smooth , time quasi - periodic change of variables on the phase space ; then we obtain the linear stability by explicitly checking that the eigenvalues of such linearised operator are purely imaginary .",
    "let us consider where @xmath2 is a compact lie group or manifold which is homogeneous w.r.t . a compact lie group ( namely there exists a compact lie group which acts on @xmath2 transitively and differentiably ) .",
    "assume that is hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath45 with real hamiltonian @xmath46    we assume that the frequency @xmath17 has a fixed diophantine direction , namely @xmath47,\\qquad    for some fixed diophantine vector @xmath48 , i.e. which satisfies @xmath49 .",
    "the search for quasi - periodic solutions of reduces to finding solutions @xmath50 of @xmath51 in some sobolev space @xmath52 of both variables @xmath53 .",
    "it is convenient to `` double '' the nls equation , namely consider the _ vector _",
    "nls operator @xmath54 on the space @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are two extensions of class @xmath57 ( in the real sense ) of @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; see for instance @xcite .",

    "actually the last sentence is not explicitly stated in @xcite but it follows directly from @xcite - corollary 2.17 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ teoremone ] relies on an abstract nash - moser scheme on sequence spaces ; as explained above , the convergence of such scheme only requires `` tame '' estimates of the inverse in high sobolev norm . following @xcite ,",
    "such estimates have been obtained by means of a _",

    "the block structure of this matrix takes into account the ( large ) multiplicity of the degenerate eigenvalues of @xmath4 on @xmath86 .",

    "then @xmath330 is well defined and the bounds , and as well as @xmath331 follow by and . recall that by the kirszbraun theorem we can extend @xmath332 to a lipschitz function on the whole interval @xmath333 $ ] .    for @xmath334",
    "we start by defining @xmath313 on the set @xmath335 using the homological equation with @xmath336 and @xmath337 ; in particular @xmath338 so that the bound follows by the inductive hypothesis and hence @xmath309 follows .",

    "the second bound in follows similarly .",

    "the norm @xmath204 ; in particular one has @xmath359 as a consequence one has that @xmath360 and ( [ eq:4.8 ] ) is verified .",
    "let us now define for @xmath163 , @xmath361 and note that , for any @xmath362 , @xmath163 , one has @xmath363 hence we have proved that for all @xmath364 the linear operator @xmath251 is conjugated via @xmath349 to @xmath365 ; see .    in order to conclude the proof of theorem [ kamalgorithm ] we only need to prove that @xmath366 we show by induction that for any @xmath367 then @xmath368 .",

    "first of all we note that @xmath383 implies @xmath384 then , for all @xmath383 the condition @xmath385 implies that @xmath386 this means that if @xmath387 , then @xmath388",
    ". otherwise if @xmath389 , one has ( since the @xmath390 s are lipschitz functions on the whole interval @xmath391 ) @xmath392 which implies the measure estimate @xmath393    now we claim that @xmath394 . for @xmath395",

    "the measure estimate follows by section [ puffetta ] since the complementary to @xmath412 in @xmath413 is @xmath414 .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we confined ourselves to the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , the only important conditions are the fact that @xmath417 is one - dimensional and that the eigenspaces of the laplacian restricted to the subspace of central function are one - dimensional .",
    "this means that our results extends directly to the case of spherical varieties of rank @xmath155 provided that we restrict ourselves to symmetric functions .",
    "it seems extremely reasonable that most results that hold true for tori can be extended to the case of homogeneous manifold ( indeed the harmonic analysis is very similar ) , provided that one restricts him / herself to central functions in order to avoid multiplicity of the eigenvalues .",
    "a very natural question is whether the reducibility results by eliasson - kuksin @xcite ( at least in the simplified case considered in procesi - xu @xcite ) can be extended also to this setting . in other words",
    ", this would mean to be able to extend the result of the present paper to the case of arbitrary rank .",
    "of course , the kam scheme works regardless of the rank : the problem concerns only the measure estimates . indeed , in the case of rank greater than @xmath155 , equation",
    "does not imply @xmath399 and hence the union in may cover the whole interval @xmath391 . in order to overcome this difficulty",
    ", one needs more precise information on the eigenvalue asymptotics .",
    "this would require a suitable extension of the notion of tplitz - lipschitz or quasi - tplitz matrices , which is most probably feasible but technically extremely complicated .",
    "another interesting problem would be to consider also autonomous equations .",
    "this is related to a better understanding of the birkhoff normal form on compact manifolds .",
    "this is still an open problem , except for the case of tori and zoll manifolds .",
    "naturally , there should be no problem in the case of @xmath0 or objects of rank @xmath155 . for more general lie groups , in principle one can compute the birkhoff normal form by using the eigenfunction multiplication rules ( @xcite , formula ( 2.20 ) ) ; however",
    ", it would probably require some very heavy computations and it is not clear which kind of information one can obtain in this way ."
