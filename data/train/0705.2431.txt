    "single top quark production at hadron colliders can proceed through three distinct partonic processes : the @xmath0 channel ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) which involves the exchange of a spacelike @xmath3 boson , the @xmath4 channel ( @xmath5 ) which proceeds via a timelike @xmath3 boson , and associated @xmath6 production ( @xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 channel processes are numerically the largest at both the tevatron and the lhc . at the tevatron",
    "the @xmath4 channel is second in magnitude and @xmath6 production has the smallest cross section . at the lhc ,",

    "the cross sections for all these processes receive contributions from soft - gluon emission which can be dominant near threshold  @xcite .",
    "threshold resummation organizes these contributions and can be used to compute higher - order corrections for many processes  @xcite . for the partonic process with momenta @xmath8",

    "the nll coefficient is @xmath27 for the @xmath4 channel , where @xmath28 is the factorization scale , and similar expressions can be given for the other channels .",
    "the complete virtual corrections ( @xmath29 terms ) can not be derived from threshold resummation but one can derive the factorization and renormalization scale terms denoted by @xmath30 in the above equation  @xcite .",
