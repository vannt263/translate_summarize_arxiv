    "several experiments probing the effect of impurities or lattice defects on superconductivity in the cuprates have been carried out @xcite in order to get more insight into the symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "the most thoroughly studied defects are zn and ni substitutions @xcite on the planar cu sites and irradiation induced oxygen vacancies @xcite in the copper oxygen planes .",
    "yet the results are difficult to explain within a standard abrikosov - gorkov type theory of impurity scattering @xcite for the scenario of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity , which is predicted to be extremely suppressed by the impurities .",
    "@xcite this issue was critically examined by radtke et al .",
    "@xcite who considered isotropic nonmagnetic impurity scattering in the born approximation and obtained the critical temperature in both weak- and strong - coupling approach close to the abrikosov - gorkov scaling function .",
    "a comparison to the electron irradiation data @xcite in @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) showed that the theoretically predicted @xmath0 was about twice as much reduced by the impurities than observed .",
    "this inconsistency can be settled down within the weak impurity scattering model if the impurity scattering rate a factor of 3 less than the one deduced from the transport measurements is assumed @xcite which is equivalent to an introduction of two separate relaxation time scales - one defining the scattering time in pair - breaking processes and the other representing the transport scattering time .",
    "such a distinction occurs naturally as a consequence of an impurity momentum - dependent scattering probability .",
    "@xcite the issue of a possible anisotropy in the impurity scattering potential was suggested in a discussion of the irradiation data by giapintzakis et al .",
    "@xcite where the authors evoked a model by millis et al .",
    "@xcite a more general formulation of the problem was given in our previous paper , @xcite where the effective correlation between two impurity vertex functions was assumed in the form @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 representing isotropic and anisotropic impurity scattering amplitude respectively and @xmath9 determining the symmetry of the impurity potential .",
    "@xcite our analysis showed that the symmetry of the anisotropic potential is an important factor and a significant reduction in the pair - breaking strength appears for large values of @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath11 denotes integration over the fermi surface ( fs ) and @xmath12 is the normalized ( @xmath13 ) angle - resolved fs density of states .",
    "particularly low @xmath0 suppression is predicted for @xmath14 that is for the anisotropy of the scattering potential in phase with the order parameter , which in the case of the @xmath1-wave superconductor corresponds to @xmath15 . within this approach",
    "we were also able to understand quantitatively the irradiation data @xcite in @xmath16 .    through the postulation of the analytic form of the square value of the impurity potential",
    "this approach has been designed for the second - order born approximation and can not be efficiently extended to include multiple impurity scattering processes .",
    "such a generalization is important from the theoretical and experimental points of view , especially in the light of the recent experiments suggesting a possible strong ( close to unitary ) scattering by zn atoms in @xmath5 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) compounds .",
    "@xcite for that purpose a model based on the assumption of the impurity potential and not its square value is needed .    in this paper we study in the t - matrix approximation the pair - breaking effect of the nonmagnetic impurities with the anisotropic momentum - dependent factorizable potential .",
    "the influence on the superconducting transition temperature is analyzed quantitatively in the born and unitary scattering limits .",
    "in particular , we find that the scattering from impurity potential in phase with the order parameter leads to a stronger suppression of the critical temperature than from the impurity potential orthogonal to the superconducting state . on the other hand",

    "as the impurity scattering strength is rather impossible to be determined from first principles , the information about the scattering process is usually deduced from a comparison of the experimental data with the theoretical models .",
    "these models assume a certain phenomenological impurity potential @xcite which is verified by a fit to the available data .",
    "we proceed in the same way by analyzing the impurity scattering potential of the factorizable form    @xmath24    the above interaction consists of two channels - the isotropic scattering channel with the scattering amplitude @xmath25 , and the anisotropic one determined by the scattering strength @xmath26 and momentum - dependent function @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath9 average value over the fermi surface @xmath27 . therefore , @xmath9 is orthogonal to the isotropic s - wave term in a sense of a scalar product defined as the fs integral and in consequence a symmetry other than the identity is introduced into the impurity potential .",
    "an additional normalization @xmath28 gives @xmath26 the meaning of the scattering strength magnitude in the anisotropic channel .",
    "the chosen potential depends on the absolute orientations in the crystal of the incoming and outgoing ( scattered ) particles momenta , not only on the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the usually assumed isotropic conditions @xcite of a spherical ( cylindrical in two dimensions ) constant energy surface and the scattering probability dependent only on the angle of deflexion are broken here .",
    "@xcite this leads to a momentum - dependence of the time between scattering events determined by the imaginary part of the self - energy and a momentum - dependent relaxation time in the boltzmann equation .",
    "@xcite this second quantity is worth mentioning as it provides the information about the normal state transport properties and can be used as an additional physical assessment of the phenomenological model .",
    "@xcite a constraint on the potential ( 1 ) which follows immediately from the analysis of the normal state properties is a nonzero value of the scattering amplitude in the isotropic channel @xmath25 .",
    "a lack of the s - wave scattering may lead in some cases to an infinite value of some elements in the dc conductivity tensor , @xcite that is to nonphysical transport properties .    the anisotropic potential from eq .",
    "( [ ei1 ] ) distinguishes a certain set of coordinates which we think should coincide with the main directions in the crystal .",
    "this assumption seems rather plausible because the impurity potential is determined by the dopant atom itself as well as its substitution site in the crystal .",
    "the potential produced by a given sort of impurity ( defect ) may be considered unique since the impurities tend to selectively substitute at characteristic sites in the crystal .",
    "the zn and ni atoms occupy the in - plane cu sites @xcite and the electron irradiation displaces the oxygen atoms from the @xmath31 planes . @xcite",
    "therefore on a short length scale of the order of magnitude of the lattice constant a given impurity dopant produces the same potential of the same orientation throughout the crystal . on the other hand , on a large length scale the impurity distribution in the system is random and the abrikosov - gorkov s method @xcite of averaging the green s functions is applicable .",
    "we have not made any assumption about the electron energy band yet and we use a general formalism deriving the equations valid for an arbitrary fermi surface . for the computational simplicity ,",
    "however , the numerical results are obtained for a cylindrical fs .",
    "this approximation allows to study the effect of the anisotropy of the impurity potential alone .",
    "the anisotropy of the fermi surface may equally enhance or suppress the pair - breaking effect of the impurities .",
    "the detailed quantitative calculations are needed to answer this question which is beyond the scope of the present paper .    for the numerical calculations we take the function @xmath9 in the scattering potential ( [ ei1 ] ) proportional to the harmonic functions which in a polar angle notation read @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an integer number .",

    "the results for the same level of the @xmath92-wave part in a @xmath2-wave order parameter as the one discussed in the born limit are shown in fig .",

    "in the overdoped samples @xmath193 data points plotted vs. impurity concentration form a universal curve independent of the critical temperature in the absence of impurities .",
    "@xcite such a universal scaling behavior is characteristic of the impurity limited superconductivity provided the pair - breaking parameter @xmath169 does not change with @xmath194 .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to a constraint @xmath195 in the unitarity limit and may be obeyed in the overdoped systems where the critical temperature decreases with increasing hole concentration .",
    "@xcite there are also indications that a large residual resistivity due to zn atoms in the cuprates corresponds to an impurity potential scattering in the unitary limit .",
    "@xcite thus , we consider the case of the unitary scattering focusing on the effect of zn dopant .",
    "working in the born scattering limit requires an estimation of the impurity scattering potential which can be obtained from the residual resistivity in the normal state .",
    "@xcite in that analysis a clear distinction between the impurity scattering life time and the transport relaxation time , which may differ if the impurity potential is anisotropic , @xcite is needed . in order to compare our unitary scattering results with the experiment we have to convert the pair - breaking parameter @xmath169 into the impurity concentration . as @xmath196 only the values of the density of states on the fermi surface and the critical temperature in the absence of impurities are needed for that purpose .",

    "@xcite there is no specific heat jump observed at the phase transition in @xmath204 compound @xcite thus the present method of obtaining the density of states can not be applied in this case .",
    "we discuss the experimental results in this system together with @xmath5 and @xmath18 compounds more extensively in ref .",
    "the density of states calculated from the above @xmath197 values are used for the evaluation of the impurity concentration , which is represented as the per cent number of impurities ( defects ) per planar cu site .",
    "we do the calculations with a fixed density of states as we do not have any quantitative data showing its change with doping or disorder .",
    "therefore , the results are not really universal and depend on the critical temperature in the absence of impurities @xmath194 .",
    "we group them according to the values of the critical temperature of a pure system . in the optimally doped @xmath5 compound @xmath194",

    "the phase diagrams for the @xmath3-wave superconductor together with the experimental data of zn doped samples @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "the scattering effect of a given potential corresponds to the area between two curves of the same style , for instance the solid lines stand for the @xmath157 impurity potential .",
    "this broadened range of values stem from the uncertainty in the estimation of the fs density of states , that is , from the accuracy of the @xmath197 values .",
    "we note , that all the experimental points fall in the region of the theoretically predicted @xmath0 suppression by the unitary impurity scattering .",
    "interestingly , the pair - breaking effect of zn atoms in certain samples corresponds to the resonant scattering in different anisotropic channel of the impurity potential .",
    "we can clearly distinguish data that can be approximated by the scattering potentials given by @xmath156 and @xmath157 functions .",
    "the rest of the experimental points lie in the range of isotropic scattering or anisotropic scattering with higher order harmonics .",
    "although the critical temperatures of the analyzed samples are very close , we do not see a universal suppression dependence as in @xmath204 and @xmath18 compounds .",
    "@xcite this feature may suggest a possible sample - dependence of the effective impurity scattering caused for instance by the differences in a sample preparation or zn substitution processes .",
    "even small changes in the hole concentration alter the electronic density of states at the fermi level and result in a modified impurity scattering rate .    according to @xmath194 values",
    ", we gather the experimental data for zn doped @xmath18 in two groups corresponding to @xmath194 equal to @xmath206 ( fig .",
    "8a ) @xcite and @xmath207 ( fig .",
    "@xcite for the sample of @xmath208 the experimental suppression of the critical temperature is in the range of anisotropic scattering determined by @xmath157 ( fig .",
    "the pair - breaking effect of zn atoms in the samples characterized by @xmath209 is on the edge of anisotropic scattering in higher order harmonics but also right in the middle of @xmath157 based anisotropic scattering .",
    "as we can see , the quantitative calculations for @xmath18 compound contain a large uncertainty margin which is caused by a lack of a precise value of the specific heat jump at the phase transition and consequently of the electron density of states on the fermi surface .",
    "the error in the experimentally estimated magnitude of @xmath197 is of the order of @xmath210 .",
    "a similar analysis of ni substituted samples shows that the pair - breaking effect in the unitary limit is stronger than observed experimentally . for the sake of comparison we present ni doped @xmath5 compound data @xcite and our theoretical curves for the resonant scattering in fig .",
    "less difference between the experimental and theoretical results is seen for @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite although this comparison is suggestive for a weak potential scattering , the detailed calculations in the born scattering limit giving the critical temperature dependence on the residual resistivity @xcite are needed in order to draw more firm conclusions .",
    "finally we discuss the electron irradiation experiments in @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the results for low - energy ( 60 - 120 kev ) incident electrons read from fig .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "21 are shown in fig .",
    "the experimental points are in the range of the pair - breaking effect of the scattering potential with the anisotropy given by @xmath157 . the initial @xmath0 suppression ,",
    "however , is more gradual than the one obtained from the theoretical calculation and can not be explained by the standard impurity pair - breaking mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any other set of electron irradiation data representing the change of the critical temperature with defect concentration . the analysis by tolpygo et .",
    "@xcite shows that the initial @xmath0 suppression for low - energy ( 100 kev ) electron irradiation reported by legris et al .",
    "@xcite agrees with the one shown in fig .",
    "10 . for higher - energy electrons @xcite @xmath0",
    "is reduced initially about twice as much as in ref .",
    "21 which becomes in the range of the @xmath157 determined behavior for low defect concentration .",
    "we have studied the pair - breaking effect of the anisotropic impurity scattering in the t - matrix approximation for @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave superconductors . the born and the unitary limits have been discussed analytically and numerically .",
    "although limited to the employed phenomenological model the conclusions we draw should be suggestive to a larger class of potentials capturing the feature of anisotropy .",
    "we have shown , that the effect of the anisotropic impurity scattering can be considered in four groups for the born scattering and three groups in the case of unitary scattering which are determined by the form of the function @xmath9 defining symmetry of the scattering potential . in both scattering limits the strongest suppression of the critical temperature is caused by the impurity potential given by @xmath158 which is in phase with the order parameter for the @xmath1 state and overlaps significantly with the @xmath2-wave state of a major @xmath3-wave component .",
    "the pair - breaking effect of this potential with a large amount of anisotropic amplitude can be comparable with the one of the isotropic scattering in the born limit and exceeds the @xmath92-wave impurity effect in the unitary limit .",
    "this issue is particularly important as it shows that a weak reduction of @xmath0 due to anisotropy of the impurity potential proportional to the superconducting order parameter which follows from the weak - scattering model @xcite is not a general feature of the anisotropic impurity scattering .",
    "another class is defined by @xmath165 .",
    "it leads to the lowest impurity pair - breaking effect in the case of the unitary scattering and second lowest for the born limit .",
    "this kind of scattering is maximal in the direction of the nodes of the order parameter and it vanishes where the gap function has its maxima .",
    "therefore , the effective scattering is minimized by the symmetry of the impurity potential .",
    "any other function orthogonal to the @xmath3-wave order parameter results in a rather universal @xmath0 suppression and falls into the third group of the potentials .",
    "the pair - breaking in this case is less than that of the isotropic scattering but it exceeds the one of @xmath157 based potential , and in the unitary limit is very close to the isotropic scattering .",
    "resonant scatterers in the @xmath20-wave channel lead to the same @xmath0 suppression as the @xmath3-wave scattering given by @xmath157 function . in the born scattering limit , however , the @xmath20-wave anisotropic scattering results in the lowest @xmath0 suppression .    we have compared our results for the @xmath1-wave superconductor with the experimental data assuming that the impurity potential is close to the unitary limit . within the accuracy of our calculations the zn atoms can be considered as the resonant scatterers in overdoped @xmath18 and @xmath5 compounds .",
    "the pair - breaking effect of the structure defects produced by the electron irradiation is also in the range of magnitude of the unitary scattering with the anisotropy of the impurity potential given by @xmath157 function .",
    "the theoretical results strongly depend on the value of the electronic density of states on the fermi surface . thus far , for some systems ( like @xmath18 ) there is only an estimation of this value with a large margin of uncertainty available .",
    "it opens a wide range of possible @xmath0 solutions and makes a proper analysis very difficult .",
    "therefore , before any final conclusion about the impurity suppression of the critical temperature in the cuprates can be made , a much more accurate determination of the electronic density of states on the fermi surface has to be done .",
    "we would like to thank b. nachumi for his help in analyzing the experimental data , as well as t. kluge for the discussions on the effect of impurities in high-@xmath0 superconductors and pointing to us several important papers .",
