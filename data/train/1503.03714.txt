    "among the outer planets , uranus is unique in two key parameters affecting atmospheric dynamics .",
    "first , it has almost a complete absence of internal heat flux . from voyager iris observations",
    "pearl et al . ( 1990 ) estimated the ratio of emission to absorbed sunlight to be @xmath1 = 1.06@xmath20.08 , while the corresponding ratio for neptune is 2.61@xmath20.28 ( pearl et al .",
    "this result , which may not be invariant , does suggest that solar energy provides the overwhelming drive for atmospheric dynamics on uranus .",
    "second , uranus rotational axis is nearly in the plane of its orbit .",
    "this produces an extreme in the fractional seasonal variation of local solar flux on uranus , and thus raises the question of what seasonal response might be generated .",
    "however , the long radiative time constant of uranus , which is longer than its 84-year orbital period ( flasar et al .",
    "1987 ) , suggests that the response should be strongly damped .",
    "allison et al .",
    "( 1991 ) concluded that at levels below the visible cloud tops , there would be a thermal phase lag of nearly a full uranian season . using a radiative - convective model wallace ( 1983 ) estimated that annual variations would be @xmath05 k at the poles and @xmath00.5 k at the equator .",
    "friedson and ingersoll ( 1987 ) found that including dynamical heat transports by baroclinic eddies resulted in peak - to - peak temperature variations that were about half those estimated by wallace and in better agreement with iris measurements at the time of the voyager encounter ( hanel et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the bland appearance of uranus at the time of the voyager encounter seemed consistent with the lack of an internal heat source and the long radiative time constant .",
    "after months of voyager 2 imaging , only eight eight discrete cloud features could be defined well enough to use as tracers of uranus zonal circulation ( smith 1986 ) .",
    "seven of these were between 27s and 40s , and one near 70s was visible only in uv images .",
    "these had relatively low contrast , ranging from from less than 1% in violet to about 7% in the red filter .",
    "the features were also very small , making them difficult to observe in moderate resolution images .",
    "subsequent hst imaging at similar wavelengths was thus understandably not very productive .",
    "the situation improved significantly in 1997 when the hst nicmos instrument made possible near ir imaging of uranus at high spatial resolution .",
    "karkoschka ( 1998 ) identified ten new discrete cloud features in the 1997 nicmos images and additional features were observed in 1998 images ( karkoschka and tomasko 1998 ) .",
    "the maximum contrast of northern cloud features was obtained at 1.87 @xmath3 m , reaching 180% in the raw nicmos images .",
    "near ir imaging at the irtf in 1998 and 1999 also revealed discrete cloud features on uranus ( forsythe et al .",
    "1999 ; sromovsky et al .",
    "these were the first discrete features seen in groundbased digital images of uranus , and the 1999 feature was the brightest ever recorded at 1.7 @xmath3 m , comprising @xmath05% of the disk - integrated brightness .",
    "recent groundbased observations with the keck telescope ao system combined exceptional light gathering capabilities and spatial resolution to reveal a great many more discrete features ( hammel et al .",
    "2001 , de pater et al .",
    "2002 , hammel et al .",
    "2005 ) , permitting improved determinations of the uranus wind profile , especially at latitudes not previously visible .",
    "karkoschka ( 1998 ) argued that the growing abundance of discrete cloud features did not represent a significant change in activity of uranus , but was due mainly to a change in view angle and improved wavelength selection .",
    "although his observations had relatively sparse sampling , he was able to identify cloud features over long time intervals from which highly accurate drift rates ( or wind speeds ) could be defined .",
    "it appeared that cloud features on uranus had generally very long lifetimes compared to cloud features on neptune , few of which can be found on subsequent rotations ( limaye and sromovsky 1991 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the wallace ( 1983 ) model predicts seasonal variations in convective activity , with most of the convection occurring between the winter solstice and shortly after equinox ( 2007 ) .",
    "the friedson and ingersoll ( 1987 ) model predicts that during the 1994 - 2007 period , the temperature contrast between north and south should be near a maximum . it remains to be understood whether the small temperature variations these models predict can explain what is turning out to be significant north - south asymmetries in the dynamics and motions of discrete cloud features .",
    "new groundbased images we obtained in 2003 and 2004 from the keck telescope provide a new abundance of discrete cloud features that we use to gain a better understanding of uranus atmospheric dynamics . in the following we discuss their morphologies , motions , and evolution , and include in the analysis results from voyager and hst observations .",
    "we extend the zonal wind observations up to 60n , and show that the north - south asymmetry of uranus zonal circulation is mainly confined to mid latitudes .",
    "we were able to determine highly accurate drift rates by tracking features that persisted for at least one month .",
    "we identify a broad range of evolutionary time scales for discrete cloud features , and show that one feature probably existed for two decades or more , and has exhibited regular oscillations in latitude and longitude , which can plausibly be associated with both rossby waves and inertial oscillations .",
    "using the nirc2 camera on the keck 2 telescope we observed uranus and neptune on 15 and 16 july 2003 , on 11 and 12 july 2004 , and on 11 and 12 august 2004 .",
    "the observing geometry for each date is summarized in table 1 , for 12:00 ut .",
    "most of our images were made with broadband j , h , and k filters using the nirc2 narrow camera .",
    "after geometric correction , the angular scale of this camera is 0.009942@xmath4/pixel ( nirc2 general specifications web page : http://alamoana.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/ genspecs.html ) .",
    "the times , filters , exposures , and airmass values for these broadband observations are provided in tables ii and iii .",
    "the exposures per coadd were chosen to avoid saturation of uranus satellite images so that they could be used for short - term photometric references .",
    "the total exposures are less than optimal and represent a compromise resulting from frequent alternation between uranus and neptune imaging during each observing run .",
    "images of hammel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) provide better s / n ratios as a result of longer exposures . the central wavelengths and bandwidths of the filters used here",
    "are given in table 4 .",
    "the pressure levels in uranus atmosphere sensed by these filters is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : specpendepth ] .",
    "we also acquired a small number of narrow - band images in 2004 to provide a cleaner constraint on vertical cloud structure .",
    "these are presented in a separate paper ( sromovsky and fry 2005 ) , hereafter referred to as paper ii .    to assess adaptive optics ( ao ) performance , we measured stellar images , satellite images and epsilon ring cross sections ( this ring is visible in fig .  2 ) . during 15 august 2003 most observations achieved effective seeing of 0.052@xmath4 - 0.09@xmath4 and was mostly in the range 0.061@xmath4 - 0.13@xmath4 on the following night . during 11",
    "july 2004 seeing was excellent , typically 0.05@xmath4 - 0.06@xmath4 with ao turned on .",
    "during 11 august 2004 , raw seeing was about 0.5@xmath4 in k and effective seeing at 2.15@xmath3 m with ao active reached 0.055@xmath4 .",
    "natural seeing during 12 august 2004 reached 0.43@xmath4 .",
    "with ao on we measured 0.07@xmath4 - 0.08@xmath4 in h stellar images ( of the relatively faint star fs34 ) .",
    "later measurements of a brighter star ( elias g 158 - 27 ) obtained fwhm values of 0.063@xmath4 - 0.070@xmath4 for h and 0.08@xmath4 - 0.090@xmath4 for j.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]             even the best fit in table 11 has a @xmath5 dominated by longitude differences , which have rms values that are 20 times the expected errors .",
    "the differences between observations and these simple fitting functions are found to be more systematic than random .",
    "for example , the @xmath5 value for the longer period fit can be halved by adding a second modulation with a 740-day period and an 80amplitude .",
    "it is also possible to get much more accurate fits by fitting smaller time spans .",
    "the inescapable conclusion from attempts to fit longitude observations is that the motion can not be accurately describe by a simple sinusoidal variation in longitude about a constant drift rate .",
    "it may be that the motion is sinusoidal with a slowly varying frequency , or that there are multiple frequencies present . a useful investigation of these issues is limited by large temporal gaps that introduce rotational ambiguities .",
    "additional observations of s34 positions at a frequency of several times per year for the next five years or more would provide excellent constraints on the nature of this variation .      the short - period oscillation of s34 has characteristics reasonably consistent with an inertial oscillation , which is a circular flow in which there is a balance between the coriolis force and the centrifugal force , and other horizontal forces are negligible .",
    "the period of an inertial oscillation is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the rotational period at latitude @xmath8 ( holton , 1972 ) .",
    "this evaluates to 15.84 h ( 0.66 earth days ) at a centric latitude of -34 , which is within 1.08 h of the best - fit period .",
    "the radius of curvature of an inertial oscillation is proportional to the speed of the flow and inversely proportional to the coriolis parameter ( @xmath9 . measured in angle instead of physical distance , the oscillation amplitude in longitude is thus expected to be larger by the ratio of the latitudinal radius of curvature to the radius of rotation at the latitude of interest , which evaluates to @xmath10 for a spherical planet .",
    "the longitude observations are somewhat too uncertain and too poorly distributed to provide much additional independent confirmation of the circular nature of the oscillation , although the results are reasonably consistent with such an oscillation .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : inertial ] , where latitudinal and longitudinal deviations are compared to model variations that are constrained to match the inertial period of 0.66 days , rather than the best - fit longitudinal period of 0.705 days .",
    "the longitudinal variations are deviations from a best fit constant drift rate computed from the 1986 voyager observations .",
    "the solid line in the lower panel is the variation expected if the longitudinal motion simply followed the latitudinal shear in the zonal wind .",
    "the dotted curve is the variation expected from the inertial oscillation alone , in the absence of meridional wind shear .",
    "the dot - dash curve is the sum of the two contributions .",
    "the temporal sampling of the observations does not provide a very good constraint on the longitudinal model , but does seem to favor the shorter period computed for the ideal inertial oscillation , while the latitudinal variations clearly prefer a slightly longer period .",
    "the peak longitude variation about the mean drift longitude is also more consistent with the inertial model expectation , although the uncertainties are too large to make this compelling evidence that this is the dominant mechanism .    for an inertial oscillation , the instantaneous drift rate would be expected to vary by a significant amount when measured over short time intervals .",
    "the relative variation is given by the relation:@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the latitudinal amplitude of the inertial oscillation and @xmath13 is time measured from a zero of the latitudinal oscillation at which latitude is increasing .",
    "for @xmath12 = 0.6 , @xmath14=-34(@xmath8=-35.24 ) , and @xmath15= 0.66 days , the amplitude of the drift rate modulation evaluates to 9.9/day .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given that the amplitude of longitude modulation is only @xmath01 .",
    "if this is sampled at positive and negative peaks , which are separated by only 0.33 days , it represents a drift rate deviation of @xmath02/0.33 days = 6/day .",
    "when these deviations are sampled over a period of 0.99 days , the drift rate perturbation is reduced to a maximum of @xmath02/day . since",
    "both negative and positive samples would be expected over two successive nights of observation , a significantly smaller perturbation would generally be expected .",
    "nevertheless , some of the deviations in drift rate from the model fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:34slowvar ] could be due to imperfectly averaged inertial oscillations .",
    "among well studied transverse atmospheric wave motions , only rossby waves can yield long enough periods to match s34 observations .",
    "the rossby wave arises from a gradient in planetary vorticity .",
    "it is a transverse wave that produces flow curvature that increases and decreases its relative vorticity to compensate for changes in planetary vorticity that result from deviations in latitude .",
    "this is the wave mode that is evident in the meandering jet stream on earth . in the northern hemisphere on earth",
    ", the phase speed is westward relative to the zonal flow .",
    "the period of the latitudinal oscillation is given by : @xmath16 where the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the zonal and meridional wavenumbers ( @xmath19wavelength ) , @xmath20 is the derivative of the coriolis parameter with respect to latitude , @xmath21 is the local radius of curvature in the latitudinal direction , @xmath22 is the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath23 is an effective thickness parameter related to vertical stratification and involvement of vertical motions with the horizontal wave motions .",
    "this form , which ignores the small curvature of the zonal wind profile relative to @xmath24 , is consistent with pedlosky ( 1979 ) .",
    "the last term in the numerator can be written in a number of ways , all dependent on the degree to which vertical motions participate in the wave motion . here",
    "we use the expression that is the inverse square of the rossby deformation radius .",
    "two cases are illustrated in fig.[fig : rossby ] , both of which assume a meridional half - wavelength of 5 .",
    "the first case is pure barotropic , which has a maximum period of only about half what is observed for s34 , even for a zonal wavenumber of unity ( per circumference ) .",
    "the second case includes the vertical motion term , with the effective depth adjusted to produce a period of 1000 days at 34s for the longest of the possible planetary wavelengths .",
    "the effective depth , which is only 0.65 km , can not be interpreted as the true physical depth of the motion ( see pedlosky 1979 ) . from this comparison ,",
    "it is clear that a pure barotropic rossby wave can not be responsible for the long - period motion of s34 , although a rossby wave with coupled vertical motions is conceivable .",
    "near - infrared adaptive optics imaging of uranus by the keck 2 telescope during 2003 and 2004 has revealed unprecedented numbers of discrete cloud features , which is partly due to improved adaptive optics performance and partly due to more of uranus northern hemisphere becoming visible as the planet approaches its 2007 equinox . increased cloud development might also play a role .",
    "specific results of our investigation are based primarily on keck observations we made in 2003 and 2004 , but also on hst and voyager observations .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "recent near ir adaptive optics imaging from the keck telescope achieved angular resolutions near 0.05@xmath4 , facilitating the detection of numerous discrete cloud features , which display a strong latitudinal variation in distribution and cloud characteristics , in reasonable accord with recent prior observations from the keck telescope ( de pater et al .",
    "2002 , hammel et al .",
    "the northern mid latitude features reach the highest altitudes and show the greatest k@xmath25 contrast and sharpest horizontal structure , while equatorial features are dim and fuzzy .",
    "features in the southern hemisphere were fewer in number , and none were seen south of a bright band near 45s .",
    "2 .   measurement of cloud motions with estimated errors less than 50 m / s were obtained for 50 northern hemisphere features and 20 southern features .",
    "this has extended prior circulation measurements up to 60n , where we found a maximum wind speed of 240@xmath250 m / s .",
    "prior results were limited to 46.4n ( hammel et al .",
    "we confirmed the presence of an asymmetry in the zonal circulation of uranus , originally pointed out by karkoschka ( 1998 ) , and improved its characterization .",
    "we find that the asymmetry is mainly evident at mid latitudes where winds are more westward ( prograde ) in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere , with an average difference of @xmath020 m / s .",
    "3 .   there is no clear indication of sustained long - term change in wind speed between 1986 and 2004 , although results of hammel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on 2001 hst and keck observations are @xmath010 m/s less westward ( less prograde ) between 30s and 45s than earlier and later results , and results of hammel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on 2003 keck observations are @xmath030 m / s more westward ( more prograde ) between 20n and 50n than both 2000 and our 2004 results .",
    "4 .   we found a large dispersion in lifetimes of discrete features that contrasts with karkoschka s characterization of features he observed with the hst nicmos camera as relatively unchanged over a 100-day period ( karkoschka 1998 ) . some of the discrete cloud features we observed have relatively short lifetimes of @xmath01 hour , some have disappeared within a month , while others have lasted at least one month , and s34 seems to have persisted for nearly two decades .",
    "the shortest lifetimes were observed for smaller low - contrast features that would not be visible in nicmos images .",
    "5 .   based on detailed morphological similarities between high - resolution voyager images in 1986 and keck images in 2004 , based on the continuity of latitudinal excursions as determined from hst and keck imaging in 1994 , 1998 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 , and from the fact that only a single feature of consistent morphology has appeared within the latitude band within which s34 is restricted , we believe that s34 has existed",
    "at least since 1986 , which , if true , would make it the longest lived discrete feature on uranus .",
    "s34 oscillates in latitude between 32s and 36.5s , with a period of @xmath01000 days , which may be a result of a non - barotropic rossby wave .",
    "its longitudinal drift rate varied between -20e / day and -31e / day in approximate accord with the latitudinal gradient in the zonal wind profile , exhibiting behavior similar to that of the ds2 feature observed on neptune ( sromovsky et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the uranus feature also exhibits a superimposed much more rapid oscillation , with a latitudinal amplitude of 0.57and period 0.7 days , which is reasonably consistent with an inertial oscillation .",
    "the inertial oscillation has a longitudinal amplitude of @xmath01 , which leads to a large variability in longitudinal drift rates measured over short time periods .",

    "<S> near - infrared adaptive optics imaging of uranus by the keck 2 telescope during 2003 and 2004 has revealed numerous discrete cloud features , 70 of which were used to extend the zonal wind profile of uranus up to 60n . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed the presence of a north - south asymmetry in the circulation ( karkoschka , science 111 , 570 - 572 , 1998 ) , and improved its characterization . </S>",
    "<S> we found no clear indication of long term change in wind speed between 1986 and 2004 , although results of hammel et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 , icarus 153 , 229 - 235 ) based on 2001 hst and keck observations average @xmath010 m / s less westward than earlier and later results , and 2003 observations by hammel et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2005 , icarus 175 , 534 - 545 ) show increased wind speeds near 45n , which we do nt see in our 2003 - 2004 observations . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a wide range of lifetimes for discrete cloud features : some features evolve within @xmath01 hour , many have persisted at least one month , and one feature near 34s ( termed s34 ) seems to have persisted for nearly two decades , a conclusion derived with the help of voyager 2 and hst observations . </S>",
    "<S> s34 oscillates in latitude between 32s and 36.5s , with a period of @xmath01000 days , which may be a result of a non - barotropic rossby wave . </S>",
    "<S> it also varied its longitudinal drift rate between -20/day and -31/day in approximate accord with the latitudinal gradient in the zonal wind profile , exhibiting behavior similar to that of the ds2 feature observed on neptune ( sromovsky et al . </S>",
    "<S> , icarus 105 , 110 - 141 , 1993 ) . </S>",
    "<S> s34 also exhibits a superimposed rapid oscillation with an amplitude of 0.57 in latitude and period of 0.7 days , which is approximately consistent with an inertial oscillation . </S>"
