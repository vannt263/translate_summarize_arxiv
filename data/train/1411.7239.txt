    "the total er yields decrease with the increase of the @xmath43 energy for its large values is inherent for all reaction since the survival probability @xmath106 decreases due to the increase of the fission probability . at the large beam energies the number of the partial waves contributing to fusion increases causing the decrease of the fission barrier @xcite .",
    "the presence of the contribution of large values of @xmath61 is confirmed by the larger values of the total er cross sections measured in the experiment @xcite .",
