    "diffusion is a typical relaxation process and appears in various fields of physics : thermal diffusion processes , spin diffusion processes , brownian motions and so on .",
    "it is empirically known that the dynamics of these processes is approximately given by the diffusion equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the diffusion constant .",
    "this equation is phenomenologically derived by employing the fick s law or the fourier s law .",
    "although the diffusion equation has broad applicability , there exist the limits of the validity .",
    "first of all , the diffusion equation does not obey causality @xcite , the propagation speed of information exceeds the speed of light .",
    "this means that we can not apply the ordinary diffusion equation to describe relativistic diffusion processes that might be realized in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "second , the diffusion equation breaks sum rules associated with conservation laws@xcite .",
    "the diffusion equation is the coarse - grained equation that is valid only for describing macroscopic motions , and hence one may claim that such a coarse - grained dynamics does not necessarily satisfy the sum rules .",
    "however , as we will see later , it is possible to derive a coarse - grained equation consistent with a sum rule .",
    "these deficiencies can be overcome by introducing relaxation times @xcite .",
    "then , the diffusion equation is changed into the following telegraph equation : @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the diffusion constant and @xmath3 is the relaxation time .",
    "the telegraph equation is reduced into the diffusion equation in the limit of @xmath4 .",
    "the propagation speed of the equation is defined by @xmath5 .",
    "one can easily see that the propagation speed of the diffusion equation diverges and hence causality is broken .",
    "thus , in the following , we call the diffusion equation given by the fick s law the `` acausal '' diffusion equation , and call the telegraph equation the `` causal '' diffusion equation . furthermore , as we will see later , the causal diffusion equation does not break sum rules .",
    "as just described , the causal diffusion equation may be more appropriate to describe diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "however , the microscopic derivation of the causal diffusion is still controversial .",
    "one of the typical methods to derive coarse - grained equations is the projection operator method ( pom ) @xcite . in this method , the motions associated with microscopic time and length scales are projected out by introducing projection operators , and we can obtain coarse - grained equations expressed in terms of variables associated with macroscopic time and length scales . as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coarse - grained equation derived by using the pom is not causal diffusion equations but acausal diffusion equations .",
    "however , it should be noted that an approximation whose validity is not obvious is introduced to obtain the acausal diffusion equation .",
    "thus , when we do not use the approximation , it may be possible to obtain causal diffusion equations instead of acausal ones by using the pom .",
    "as a matter of fact , the author recently applied the pom to derive the coarse - grained equation of the order parameter that describes the critical dynamics of the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "the derived equation fulfills the requirements near the critical temperature and converges to the equilibrium state consistent with mean - field results evaluated in finite temperature field theory .",
    "however , the equation shows the relaxation exhibiting oscillation .",
    "this behavior is different from that of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation that has been assumed as a phenomenological equation of the critical dynamics .",
    "we can look upon the tdgl equation as the acausal diffusion equation for `` non - conserved '' quantities because of its overdamping behavior .",
    "then , the appearance of the oscillation means that a kind of relaxation time is introduced .",
    "this result suggests to us that if we apply the pom to derive a coarse - grained equation of a `` conserved '' quantity , for instance , a number density , the coarse - grained dynamics may be accompanied by oscillation like the causal diffusion dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the pom to a non - relativistic model and show that the coarse - grained equation of the number density has a similar form to the causal diffusion equation instead of the acausal one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we summarize the pom . in section 3 , we apply the pom to a non - relativistic model and derive the coarse - grained equation of the number density .",
    "the number density is a conserved quantity in this model and there exists the sum rule associated with the conservation law .",
    "we investigate the relation between the coarse - grained equation and the sum rule in section 4 .",
    "the coarse - grained equation contains the memory effect , which can be eliminated by employing the markov limit .",
    "then , the equation has a similar form to the causal diffusion equation , as is shown in section 5 . in the acausal diffusion equation of the number density",
    ", it is known that the diffusion constant is given by the time correlation function of the number density . however , the simple relation is changed for causal diffusion equations .",
    "the reason is discussed in section 6 .",
    "the summary and concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we give a short review of the pom @xcite .",

    "the second term is the memory term that causes dissipation .",
    "the third term is the noise term .",
    "we can show that the memory term can be expressed by the time correlation of the noise . this relation is called the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of the second kind @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper , we simply drop the noise term in the following discussion .",
    "note that the memory term contains the coarse - grained time - evolution operator @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath32 see appendix [ app : conv ] for details .",

    "see @xcite for details .    substituting them into the tc equation ( [ eqn : tc-2 ] ) and setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the coarse - grained equation of the number density is derived . as is discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the memory function is approximately given by calculating the contribution of the ring diagram shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "then , we set @xmath49 for simplicity .",
    "finally , we have the integrodifferential equation of the number density , @xmath50 here , the memory function @xmath51 is defined by the inverse - laplace transform of @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 here , @xmath56 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the function @xmath59 corresponds to the simple contribution of the one - loop fermion diagram and is interpreted in the kinematical way as is discussed in refs .",

    "of the equation has the @xmath88 dependence .",

    "this is the reason why we employ the kubo s canonical correlation as the definition of the scalar product contained in the projection operator . on the other hand ,",
    "when we employ the time - smoothed density matrix as the definition of the scalar product , the microscopic degrees of freedom stays in the non - equilibrium state and hence the derived coarse - grained equation describes the evolution of the fluctuations from the non - equilibrium state .",

    "the mori projection operator satisfies the condition ( [ eqn : p ] ) , and this plays an important role in deriving the tc equation ( [ eqn : tc-2 ] ) .",

    "when the initial value is induced by the external field @xmath137 defined in the preceding section , we can set @xmath161 expanding the laplace - fourier transform for large values of @xmath73 , we have @xmath162 this expression has the term proportional to @xmath77 , while the corresponding term vanishes in eq .",

    "furthermore , @xmath70 in the diffusion equation is @xmath163 this expression fails to satisfy the sum rule ( [ eqn : sr2 ] ) .",
    "thus , if the coarse - grained dynamics is approximated by the acausal diffusion equation , the time - evolution completely breaks the sum rule .",
