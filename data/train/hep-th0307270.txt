    "the mechanism for providing the gauge boson with the mass in strong interactions is still under the debate , although fifty years are going to pass since the discovery of the non - abelian gauge theory by yang and mills @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that the normal massless vacuum of yang  mills theory is unstable , since a group singlet pair of transverse yang  mills gauge boson forms a bound state with a negative energy eigenvalue ( cooper pair ) due to attractive force .",
    "consequently , the stable vacuum is realized after the condensation of these pairs .",
    "the excitation spectrum has a gap without breaking the global gauge ( color ) symmetry for any coupling strength and the gauge bosons acquire a common mass .    in the classical level ,",
    "yang - mills theory is a scale - invariant ( actually , conformal invariant ) field theory describing massless gauge bosons . by the gauge principle ,",
    "the existence of the mass term is prohibited in the classical yang - mills theory . in the quantum level",
    ", on the other hand , one has the possibility of the dynamical mass generation for the gauge boson as investigated long ago @xcite .    in the above context , among others , it is important to recall a pioneering work by fukuda and kugo @xcite in which they discussed the transverse gluon pair condensation by using the variational technique for @xmath5 yang  mills theory already in the late 1970s .",
    "they adopted the coulomb gauge in the hamiltonian formalism and dealt with only the transverse modes with no ghost .",
    "the basic tools were the cooper equation , bogoliubov transformation and the gap equation .",
    "however , the resulting energy spectrum @xmath6 did not have the relativistically invariant form @xmath7 , since their analyses are based on the non - covariant formalism . in the second paper @xcite ,",
    "fukuda attacked the same problem in covariant form by making use of the effective action or potential and the resulting schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "he obtained qualitatively the same result as the first paper .",
    "these works demonstrated that the vacuum of the massive phase can have the lower energy than the normal vacuum .",
    "if two gauge particles form a bound state , the bound state should be a tachyon pole , since two gauge particles are massless .",
    "the existence of the tachyon bound state was also discussed by solving the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in the ladder approximation @xcite where the landau gauge @xmath8 is a preferred choice . from the viewpoint of the dynamical symmetry breaking , the existence of goldstone pole as a consequence of the condensation phenomena was discussed by several works @xcite in the framework of sd and bs equations .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the solutions of the sd and bs equations strongly depend on the choice of gauge fixing parameter @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the result is strongly gauge dependent ; for @xmath10 the tachyon pole which is group singlet and spin singlet exists , whereas such a pole does not exist for @xmath11 .",
    "it is notorious that the systematic improvement is rather difficult in the sd and bs approach .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the problem based on a manifestly lorentz covariant formulation .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the manifestly relativistic result .",
    "quite recently , it was shown @xcite that the transverse gluon pair condensation can be replaced by the on - shell brst invariant vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2 which was proposed by the author @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we show that the @xmath0 expansion can be set up to yield the condensation phenomena in the systematic way .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion is a non - perturbative method which is systematically improvable , in contrast to solving the approximate gap equation by adopting the ad hoc approximation . in our approach ,",
    "the existence of the pair condensation is also a gauge independent phenomena in the sense ; if it occurs at a certain gauge at all , it should occur in all the other gauges .",
    "the @xmath12 expansion was extensively used in the past works .",
    "the well - known examples are among others the o(n ) symmetric four - fermion model ( e.g. , two - dimensional gross - neveu model ) and the non - linear @xmath13 model @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that the three - dimensional four - fermion model become renormalizable in the @xmath14 expansion @xcite , although it is non - renormalizable in weak - coupling perturbation expansion .",
    "the four - dimensional yang - mills theory in the @xmath0 expansion might be related to the string theory @xcite .",
    "see e.g. , @xcite for reviews of large n expansion .    it should be noted that the @xmath0 expansion given in this paper is quite different from the conventional one for the yang - mills theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt the lorentz covariant gauge .",
    "the maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge will be treated in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we rewrite the original yang - mills action which includes the cubic and quartic gluon self - interactions to an equivalent theory without gluon self - interaction by introducing sufficient number of auxiliary fields .",
    "consequently , the gluon field can be integrated out exactly . in section 3 , we set up a new @xmath0 expansion of the @xmath1 yang - mills theory on a non - trivial vacuum where the vacuum condensation of mass dimension two takes place .",
    "we give feynman rules of the relevant @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the low - energy and high - energy behavior of the auxiliary field propagators are studied . as a by - product",
    ", the mass of the lightest glueball is given . in section 4",
    ", we obtain the effective potential of the theory and estimate the effective gluon mass by making use of the lattice data . in section 5 , we calculate the static potential between a pair of color charges to the leading order of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "we show that the static potential is composed of the yukawa - type potential and the linear potential with the non - vanishing string tension which is proportional to the vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2 . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the string representation of the yang - mills theory within the scheme of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
