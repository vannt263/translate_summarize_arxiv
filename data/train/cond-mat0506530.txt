    "in a beautiful experiment moritz _ et al . _ recently reported the observation of two - particle bound states of  @xmath0k confined in a one - dimensional matter waveguide @xcite . in the experiment",
    "an array of equivalent one - dimensional quantum system is realized by trapping a mixture of two hyperfine states of  @xmath0k atoms in a two - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the atoms are trapped at the intensity maxima and the radial confinement is only a fraction of the lattice period . at a given value of the magnetic field the binding energy @xmath1 of the bound states",
    "is probed by radio - frequency spectroscopy .",
    "although moritz _",
    "_ realized its limitations , the description of the experiment makes use of a single - channel model of radially confined atoms interacting with a pseudopotential @xcite . within this model",
    "the bound - state energy @xmath1 is related to the s - wave scattering length @xmath2 of the atoms by @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the atomic mass , and @xmath6 is the radial trapping frequency . to vary the scattering length , however , the experiment makes use of a feshbach resonance at a magnetic field of @xmath7  gauss .",
    "for such a feshbach resonance a two - channel approach is physically more realistic .    for the feshbach problem the molecular binding",
    "energy @xmath1 always satisfies the equation @xcite , @xmath8 here the detuning @xmath9 varies as a function of the magnetic field and depends on the difference in magnetic moments @xmath10 between the open and closed channels in the feshbach problem .",
    "the resonance is located at the magnetic field strength @xmath11 . for the homogeneous fermi gas the molecular selfenergy",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath12 which leads to corrections to the single - channel result @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the atom - molecule coupling , @xmath15 is the width of the feshbach resonance , @xmath10 is the difference in magnetic moments , and @xmath16 is the background scattering length .        in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show for this three - dimensional case the molecular binding energy for both the single and two - channel approaches , respectively .",
    "whereas the single - channel results deviate significantly from the experimental data , there is an excellent agreement with the two - channel theory .",
    "it is therefore _ a priori _ not clear that in the one - dimensional case the single - channel theory as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is sufficiently accurate for the full range of magnetic fields explored by the experiment . in the following",
    "we derive the selfenergy for the confined case and make a comparisson with the experimental data .",
    "two atoms in a waveguide near a feshbach resonance are described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath17 here @xmath18 represents the atomic contribution , @xmath19 describes the bare molecules , and @xmath20 is the atom - molecule coupling .",
    "explicitely we have for the atoms , @xmath21 with @xmath22 the kinetic energy of atom @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the strength of the nonresonant atom - atom interaction , and @xmath25 the relative coordinate of the two atoms .",
    "the atoms are coupled to a molecular channel with a coupling @xmath20 . near the resonance we have that @xmath26 , which allows us to neglect the nonresonant atom - atom interaction in that case . for two atoms in the waveguide",
    "the two - channel feshbach problem in the relative coordinate , after splitting off the center - of - mass motion , is then given by , @xmath27 here the atomic hamiltonian is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the radial component of @xmath25 .",
    "only the relative part is relevant here , since only this part contains the interaction between the atoms .",
    "the bare detuning is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath32 of @xmath33 that are relevant for an s - wave feshbach resonance are a product state of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator wave function in the radial direction and a plane wave along the axial direction .",
    "the associated energies are given by the eigenstates of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator that are relevant for s - wave scattering can be written as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the generalized laguerre polynomial and @xmath36 . from eq .",
    "( [ seq ] ) we obtain the following equation determining the binding energy of the molecules : @xmath37 using the above mentioned eigenstates of @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ seq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath38 using also the usual pseudopotential approximation for the atom - molecule coupling , we have that @xmath39 . substituting this and performing the @xmath40 integration",
    "we obtain @xmath41 the inverse square root @xmath42 in the summand can be represented by the integral @xmath43 . to evaluate the sum over @xmath44 we substitute the above integral representation .",
    "the dependence on @xmath44 of the summand appears now in the exponent and in the degree of the laguerre polynomial . as a result",
    "the sum can be directly evaluated by making use of the generating functions of the laguerre polynomials , @xmath45 in our case we have @xmath46 . using this result and making the transformation @xmath47 we arrive at @xmath48 for small values of @xmath49 the integrand in the above equation behaves as @xmath50 .",
    "note that we have @xmath51 we add and subtract this integral from eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and in doing so we explicitely split off the @xmath52 divergence from the sum .",
    "the divergence in the selfenergy is energy independent and is related to the ultraviolet divergence that comes about because we have used pseudopotentials . to deal with this divergence",
    "we have to use the renormalized detuning instead of the bare detuning .",
    "the former is defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is determined by the experimental value of the magnetic field @xmath11 at resonance and the magnetic moment difference @xmath55 bohr magneton for the  @xmath0k atoms of interest .",
    "note that , as expected , the required subtraction is exactly equal to the one needed in the absence of the optical lattice . in the latter case",
    "we have to subtract @xmath56 @xcite , which can be interpreted as @xmath57 . using the renormalized detuning",
    "we find that the binding energy of the dressed molecules satisfies the desired equation @xmath58 where the molecular selfenergy for the harmonically confined one - dimensional system is given by @xmath59",
    "using the selfenergy for the confined gas we can now solve for the binding energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . the result is also shown in fig .",
    "we find an improved description of the experiment , although the differences with the single - channel prediction are small near resonance and only become large for larger detunings .",
    "this presents one way in which to experimentally probe these differences .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible to directly measure the bare molecule fraction @xmath60 of the dressed molecules @xcite , which is always equal to zero in the single - channel model . to be concrete",
    "we have for the dressed molecular wave function @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the wave function of the bare molecules and @xmath63 denotes the wave function of the atom pair in the open channel of the feshbach resonance . with this application in mind",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also the probability @xmath60 , which is determined from the selfenergy by @xmath64 .",
