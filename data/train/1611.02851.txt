    "spatio - temporal variability is of major importance in several applications , in particular for anthropogenic and natural processes such as : earthquakes , geographic evolution of diseases , income distributions , mortality fields , atmospheric pollutant concentrations , hydrological basin characterization and precipitation fields . for many natural phenomena involving , for instance , climate change and atmospheric variables ,",
    "many branches of applied sciences have been increasingly interested in the analysis of data distributed over the whole spherical shell representing planet earth and evoling across time .",
    "hence the need for random fields models where the spatial location is continuously indexed through the sphere , and where time can be either continuous or discrete .",
    "it is common to consider the observations as a partial realization of a spatio - temporal random field which is usually considered to be gaussian ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the dependence structure in space - time is governed by the covariance of the spatio - temporal gaussian field , and we refer the reader to @xcite for significant contributions in this direction .",
    "specifically , let @xmath2 be a positive integer , and let @xmath3 be the @xmath4-dimensional unit sphere in the euclidean space @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath7 .",
    "we denote @xmath8 a gaussian field on @xmath9 .",
    "the _ tour de force _ in @xcite characterizes isotropic gaussian random fields on the sphere through karhunen ",
    "love expansions with respect to the spherical harmonic functions and the angular power spectrum .",
    "they show that the smoothness of the covariance is connected to the decay of the angular power spectrum and then discuss the relation to sample hlder continuity and sample differentiability of the random fields .",
    "the present paper extends the work of @xcite to space - time .",
    "such extension is non - trivial and depends on two alternative spectral decompositions of a gaussian field on spheres across time .",
    "in particular , we propose either hermite or classical karhunen - loeve expansions and show how regularity properties as well as sample hlder continuities can evolve dinamically over time .",
    "the crux of our arguments rely on recent advances on the characterization of covariance functions associated to gaussian fields on spheres across time ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the berg - porcu representation in terms of schoenberg functions inspires the proposal of alternative spectral decompositions for the temporal part , which become then crucial to establish the regularity properties of the associated gaussian field .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to simulation methods which should be computationally fast while keeping a reasonable level of accuracy , resulting in a notorious trade off .",
    "efficient simulation methods for random fields defined on the sphere cross time are , currently , almost unexplored .",
    "cholesky decomposition is an attractive alternative since it is an exact method .",
    "however , the method has an order of computation of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 denoting the sample size . this makes computationally challenging its implementation in problems of large scale ( the so called big problem ) .",
    "the search for efficient simulation methods is thus mandatory .",
    "we propose a simulation method based on a suitable truncation of the proposed double spectral decompositions .",
    "we establish its accuracy in the @xmath1 sense and illustrate how the model keeps a reasonable level of accuracy while being especially fast , even when the number of spatio - temporal locations is very high .",
