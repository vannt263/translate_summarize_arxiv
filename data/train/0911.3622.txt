    "though the mass of the top quark has been measured precisely , its coupling to other particles and production and decay schemes have not been probed in detail so far .",
    "the top s large mass @xmath1 gev , and hence its large coupling to the higgs and longitudinal component of the @xmath2 boson makes it a sensitive probe of the mechanism of electroweak symmerty breaking ( esb ) .",
    "top quark properties are an important input to electroweak precision analysis .",
    "alternative mechanisms of esb and many new physics scenarios incorporate a special role for the top quark .",
    "it is thus important to determine if the couplings of the top follow those of the first two generations as in the standard model ( sm ) or different electroweak and/or strong couplings apply in this case .",
    "an important property of the top is that it decays before hadronization ( with a lifetime @xmath3 which is an order of magnitude smaller than the hadronization lifetime of @xmath4 ) . as a result the spin of the _ bare _ top is not diluted by hadronization , but is imprinted on characteristic angular distributions of its decay products , the @xmath2 boson and @xmath5 quark . for a review see @xcite .",
    "the degree of top polarization depends on its production process and thus can probe sm / bsm scenarios , since any couplings of the top to new particles can alter its degree of polarization . in this talk",
    ", we investigate the effects on top polarization , via decay lepton angular distributions , due to the presence of a high mass vector resonance , like the @xmath6 in littlest higgs models .",
    "the polarization of the top is detected through the angular distribution of its decay products .",
    "mass reconstruction is better for the hadronic decay channel but it suffers from a large qcd background .",
    "the leptonic channel is cleaner but mass reconstruction is difficult due to missing energy . for a @xmath7 final state at a hadron collider",
    "the optimal detection channel is semileptonic with @xmath8 and @xmath9 jets .",
    "top polarization can allow measurements of parameters of the model / new physics and can give more information on the production mechanism than just the cross section .",
    "it requires parity violation and thus measures left - right mixing and can probe @xmath10 violation through dipole couplings . even in parity conserving qcd , though the top is produced unpolarized ( at tree level ) , there are different rates for opposite helicity and same helicity @xmath7 production , i.e , the spin of the @xmath11 is correlated with the @xmath12 .",
    "top spin can be measured by the angular decay distribution of the particle / jet @xmath13 in the rest frame of the top . for hadronic @xmath7 production ,",
    "spin correlations between the decay leptons from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "these spin correlations measure the asymmetry between the production of like and unlike helicity pairs of @xmath7 which can probe new physics in top pair production",
    ". however , this requires the reconstruction of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 rest frames , which is difficult , if not impossible , at the lhc . here",
    "we investigate if _ single top polarization _ can be a qualitative or quantitative probe of new physics and can provide better statistics for top pair production at the lhc .",
    "new physics can also appear in the @xmath0 decay vertex , apart from that in top production , leading to changed decay width and distributions for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the model independent form factor for the @xmath0 vertex can be parametrised as @xmath16 \\label{anomaloustbw}\\ ] ] where for the sm @xmath17 and the anomalous couplings @xmath18 .",
    "the simultaneous presence of new physics in top production and decay can complicate the analysis making it difficult to isolate new couplings of the top .",
    "however it has been proved that _",
    "angular distributions _ of charged leptons/@xmath19 quarks from top decay are _ not affected by the anomalous @xmath20 vertex _ , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this has been shown very generally for a @xmath21 process and assumes the narrow width approximation ( nwa ) for the top and neglects terms quadratic in the anomalous couplings in ( [ anomaloustbw ] ) , assuming new physics couplings to be small .",
    "this implies that charged lepton angular distributions , a _ decoupled observable _ , are more accurate probes of top polarization , and thus to new physics in top production alone .",
    "in contrast , the energy distributions of the @xmath15 or the angular distributions of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 are `` contaminated '' by the anomalous @xmath0 vertex .",
    "invariant mass distribution in gev for top pair production at the lhc for the total ( left ) and polarized ( right ) cross sections with @xmath22 gev and @xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ]   invariant mass distribution in gev for top pair production at the lhc for the total ( left ) and polarized ( right ) cross sections with @xmath22 gev and @xmath23.,title=\"fig : \" ]    using the spin density matrix formalism for top production and decay ( which retains the spin information of the decaying quark ) and the nwa , the amplitude squared can be factored into production and decay parts as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath27 production and decay spin density matrices .",
    "after phase space integration of @xmath25 the resulting top production density matrix @xmath28 can be used to define the polarization density matrix @xmath29 where the top longitudinal polarization is @xmath30 .",
    "the transverse polarization in the production plane is @xmath31 while the transverse polarization perpendicular to the production plane is @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 s can be calculated from the decay lepton angular distributions by a suitable combination of polar and azimuthal angular asymmetries , for details see @xcite .",
    "this requires partial or complete reconstruction of the top momentum in the lab frame .",
    "alternatively , the azimuthal distribution of the lepton in the lab frame can be used to probe top polarization .",
    "@xmath35 production at the lhc proceeds therough @xmath36 . in models with an extra heavy gauge boson , @xmath34",
    ", top pair production receives an extra contribution in the @xmath37 channel apart from the @xmath38 and gluon . for concreteness",
    "we choose the littlest higgs model where the left handed couplings to quarks of the resonance @xmath6 can be parametrized as @xmath39 for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electroweak coupling and @xmath42 is a mixing angle in the model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 mass and coupling @xmath43 completely specify @xmath35 production and decay dynamics .",
    "1 shows the effects of the @xmath6 resonance on the total cross section and the difference between the cross sections for the left and right handed top s . understandably , the resonace is sharper for the polarized cross section because of the absence of the large qcd background .",

    "they are a pure probe of top polarization , since they are independent of any possible new physics in top decay",
    ". however , the polar angle , measuring the forward backward asymmetry with respect to boost direction in the parton cm frame , is only mildly sensitive to the magnitude of top polarization and almost insensitive to the sign of polarization .",
    "this leaves the lepton azimuthal angle @xmath47 measured with respect to the @xmath35 production plane .",
    "2 shows the normalized @xmath47 distribution for the sm and the littlest higgs for @xmath48 gev and @xmath23 .",
    "the peak at @xmath49 is sensitive to the magnitude of top polarization @xmath50 and can distinguish between right and left handed tops ( @xmath51 in this case resulting in the @xmath47 distribution being symmetric around @xmath52 ) .",
    "we can thus construct a normalized azimuthal asymmetry sensitive to top polarization for comparision with the sm case , by taking the difference between cross sections in the ( 1,4 ) and ( 2,3 ) quadrants : @xmath53 . a plot of the azimuthal asymmetry for different @xmath43 is shown in fig .",
    "2 as function of @xmath6 mass . @xmath45",
    "reflects the degree of top polarization , saturating to the sm value for large @xmath46 and equalling it around 600 gev .",
    "we find a large sensitivity for the variable @xmath54 , the difference between the azimuthal asymmetries in the littlest higgs and sm .",
