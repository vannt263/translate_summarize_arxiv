    "star formation is a complex process governed by several intertwined physical processes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the core mechanism is the collapse under gravity of dense regions of gas into stars , with this for the most part taking place in giant molecular clouds with only around ten per cent of stars forming in isolation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . opposing this",
    "are thermal pressure along with turbulent kinetic motions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and magnetic fields ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the confluence of these processes governs the properties of a new stellar population such as the number of stars , their masses , locations , multiplicity and dynamics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important questions concerning star formation is why it is so inefficient , with of order a few percent of the gas available on large scales being transformed into stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "feedback from young stars , in the form of ionizing radiation , stellar winds or supernova explosions , is often invoked as a solution , but numerical simulations have repeatedly shown that feedback has at most a moderate effect on the star formation efficiency of dense gas ( @xcite and other papers in this series ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the effect is much more significant in lower density gas , but it is instead in the higher density gas that star formation takes place .",
    "this would seem to indicate that feedback can not greatly impact the efficiency of star formation .    in reality star formation takes place in dense and cold molecular hydrogen gas at the centre of these clouds .",
    "the optical depth here is high enough that they are shielded from the external galactic radiation field , while the outer layers of the cloud are exposed and form an envelope of atomic hydrogen ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of star forming clouds have found them to typically be marginally bound , though the virial parameter for individual clouds varies from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "restricting a cloud rather than allowing it to freely expand into a vacuum would keep its average volume density higher than otherwise .",
    "@xcite argued using observations that a cloud s star formation efficiency ( sfe ) per free - fall time is independent of its density , allowing @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to formulate star formation laws based on turbulence .",
    "simulations by @xcite found that the sfe increases for more tightly bound clouds .",
    "newer simulations by @xcite and observations by @xcite found a positive correlation between sfe and density .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of sequential star formation taking place as ionizing feedback from young stellar clusters repeatedly sweeps up material to form new clusters .",
    "as such we ask how the sfe might change with the loss of a cloud s envelope due to feedback in a similar scenario , though with the feedback here taking a negative rather than positive form .",
    "observations and models agree that the transition from warm low density gas to cold high density gas is gradual and that there is a mixture of phases present @xcite . to test the envelope s effect on star formation efficiency , we envision a simplified geometry with a warmer low density envelope surrounding the cold , dense and turbulent gas where star formation can occur .",
    "the extra gravity and pressure from the envelope keeps the super - virial cloud from expanding .",
    "two scenarios follow : one in which the envelope remains in place , and one in which it is later removed as a first order approximation to its stripping by stellar feedback . in this paper",
    "we report on simulations of such a cloud within a transient warm envelope in order to ask whether such feedback can contribute to a significant reduction in the star formation efficiency in the dense gas .",
    "smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) is a lagrangian technique used to model a fluid as a set of particles .",
    "each particle s mass is spread throughout a volume with the use of a smoothing kernel .",
    "the fluid equations may then be reformulated as sums over the particles by treating the density , internal energy and so on as interpolated quantities .",
    "the simulations shown later in this paper were performed with the sph code sphng ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this code allows for the creation of sink particles which represent stars . as a lagrangian method",
    ", sph also allows for mass to be traced throughout a simulation .",
    "this makes the method widely used in astrophysics , and as such many papers provide in - depth descriptions .",
    "some recommendations are @xcite and @xcite for basic overviews , and @xcite for details of the grad - h formalism which was used here .",
    "the basic simulation setup is as follows .",
    "firstly , a spherical cloud of radius @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 was created .",
    "the original density was uniform with a value of @xmath11 , giving a free - fall time of @xmath12 .",
    "its temperature was set to @xmath13 .",
    "the region from @xmath14 to @xmath15 was then filled with gas at @xmath16 and a density a factor of ten lower then the inner cloud .",
    "the sound speed in the cold inner cloud was @xmath17 while in the warm outer envelope it was @xmath18 .",
    "note that the gas in both structures has a mean molecular weight of @xmath19 , that for a mix of atomic hydrogen and helium , and differs only in temperature .",
    "allowing it to change with phase would be desirable for a ` complete ' simulation , but here it is kept constant both as a numerical convenience and in order to keep the model simple . from this point the terms ` cloud ' and ` envelope ' will refer to the inner and outer structures respectively .",
    "a turbulent velocity field following an approximately kolmogorov power spectrum of @xmath20 was applied to the cloud .",
    "the @xmath6 value @xcite is the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal energy to the gravitational binding energy .",
    "the velocities were scaled such that , when considering the cloud in isolation , it would be unbound with @xmath21 .",
    "as such the root mean square ( rms ) speed was @xmath22 ( mach number @xmath23 ) , a value slightly above the @xmath24 to @xmath25 that might be expected for a cloud of this size and mass from the larson relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the envelope on the other hand was allowed to remain with no internal motions .",
    "either thermal or ram pressure from the envelope could have been used to constrain the cloud , so while it was set to a temperature of @xmath16 , a lower value could have been used and the envelope also made turbulent . for simplicity , we used thermal pressure alone .",
    "the same simulation was run with a less bound cloud by taking the original cloud of radius @xmath2 and removing the layer from @xmath26 to @xmath2 , then recreating the envelope by populating the region from @xmath26 to @xmath15 with low density warm gas as before .",
    "this left the cold cloud with a mass of @xmath27 , and as such in isolation @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath2 setups were created at four resolution levels of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 per particle . due to the initial random particle placement",
    ", the total cloud mass did vary very slightly between different resolution simulations when deriving the @xmath33 clouds .",
    "a single simulation was similarly set up to run with a cloud size of @xmath34 at the @xmath31 resolution level . with a mass of @xmath35 ,",
    "this cloud was most unbound with @xmath36 .",
    ".the simulation names and meanings .",
    "the name reflects the cloud radius in parsecs and the resolution of the simulation ( very low , low , medium or high ) .",
    "the second column gives the gas particle mass in solar units .",
    "the final two columns provide the mass of the cloud and envelope .",
    "each run had two variations ",
    "one in which the warm envelope remained for the whole simulation s duration ( indicated by prefixing the name given here with an ` e ' ) and another in which it was removed after a quarter of the cloud s crossing time ( indicated by ` x ' ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cloud_alphas ]    of interest is the star formation efficiency per free - fall time , @xmath37 , which we calculated at time @xmath38 by @xmath39 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath40 we used the time at which the envelope was removed from the @xmath2 cloud , @xmath41 . at this point structure",
    "had been generated and thus the clouds can be considered to have been in a star forming configuration .",
    "we calculated @xmath37 for each simulation at @xmath42 .",
    "this was far enough into the runs that a reasonable fraction of mass had been allowed to convert to sink particles , but still early enough that data for most simulations was available .",
    "furthermore , the period @xmath43 is almost exactly @xmath44 , a stellar age often assumed in observational analysis of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the values of @xmath37 are shown along with @xmath6 and @xmath45 for all simulations in table  [ tab : cloud_alphas ] .",
    "the runs which ended before @xmath46 are given with @xmath37 for the latest time available .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sfeff_vs_alpha ] we show these data in a plot of @xmath37 against the virial parameter .",
    "as noted in section  [ s : method ] , the @xmath2 cloud was the most bound .",
    "the cloud alone was set up to have twice as much kinetic as gravitational energy , and so is found with @xmath21 as the thermal energy in the cloud was negligible when compared to kinetic energy . while the envelope was warm and so provided a great amount of thermal energy , the extra mass provided even more gravitational energy , resulting in the overall effect of the envelope being increase the @xmath6 .",
    "this was the case with all runs .    with the shift in @xmath6 provided by the envelope",
    ", it can be seen in figure  [ fig : sfeff_vs_alpha ] that , with some scatter , a relation exists between boundedness and @xmath37 .",
    "this is particularly seen with e3pc  medres and the x4pc runs which lay nearly on top of one another despite there being a factor of @xmath47 difference in star forming cloud mass . x3pc  medres formed no stars and thus had @xmath48 . if one does form a relation between the plotted quantities , then it may be that @xmath37 would go to zero for all values of @xmath6 above perhaps four or five . to demonstrably show",
    "this would however require more simulations to fill this region .",
    "it is apparent that removing the envelope early on led to very different star formation efficiencies .",
    "we decided to run an extra set of simulations derived from e4pc  medres in which the envelope was removed at several times before and after @xmath49 , in an attempt to determine if there might be a critical point beyond which the removal no longer affected the sfe .",
    "the sfe is plotted against time for these simulations in figure  [ fig : sfe_r4pc_late_kill_linlin ] , which shows the original e4pc  medres simulation and others in which the envelope was removed at @xmath50 ( the original x4pc  medres ) , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "star formation in e4pc  medres commenced at @xmath55 .",
    "examination of figure  [ fig : sfe_r4pc_late_kill_linlin ] shows that the two simulations in which the envelope was removed before the first free fall time began forming stars only after that time . the simulations in which the envelope was removed from @xmath56 onwards generally followed the e4pc  medres curve for a short period of at most @xmath57 after the split and then fell away after a brief period during which the cloud reacted to the sudden loss of the envelope .",
    "this was not immediate : the gradients of the sfe in ` late loss ' ( @xmath58 ) runs began high , and slowly tended down over time towards values more closely resembling the gradients of the two ` early loss ' ( @xmath59 ) runs .",
    "this can in particular be seen for the two longest running simulations , those which lost their envelopes at @xmath60 and @xmath54 .",
    "it is possible however that the downturn in the sfe as it approached @xmath61 in the latter run actually occurred due to star forming material becoming more scarce .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfe_r4pc_late_kill_linlin ] makes it clear that a removal of the envelope inevitably led to a reduction in the sfe , though a later removal brings it closer to that of the simulation which retained it .",
    "thus no critical point for its effect would appear to exist , at least within the simulation runtimes achieved .",
    "( the original ) . whether it took place before or after star formation had commenced , the loss of the envelope always caused a drop in the sfe .",
    "those clouds which lost their envelopes afterwards typically followed e4pc ",
    "medres for a short while before peeling away.,width=340 ]",
    "star formation principally occurs in the cold and dense gas of giant molecular clouds . yet",
    "these clouds will themselves be enshrouded with a warm atomic envelope , which can help to bind the cloud and thus keep it contained .",
    "it is possible however that feedback from nearby massive stars , whether in the form of ionisation , winds or supernovae , could blow away the envelope .",
    "as the envelope alters the cloud s boundedness , we asked how its loss would change the star formation efficiency of the remaining dense molecular cloud .    using smoothed particle hydrodynamics we ran isothermal star forming simulations of three dense , cold and turbulent clouds , initially spherical , with radii of @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath2 .",
    "the smaller clouds were themselves derived from the 5 pc cloud . in isolation",
    "all three clouds would have been unbound with @xmath6 , the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal to gravitational energy , of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the clouds were not evolved in isolation however , but rather they were placed within a warm envelope which provided a confining pressure boundary .",
    "the envelopes had a density a factor of ten lower , extending outwards in all cases to @xmath15 . with their presence",
    "the values of @xmath6 were lowered to @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , again respectively with the @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath2 clouds .",
    "these simulations were evolved through to the point where stars could form , numerically represented by sink particles . however",
    ", a parallel simulation was created from each of the originals after @xmath68 of evolution . in these runs , the warm envelope was instantaneously removed to leave only the cold central cloud .",
    "this was our first order approximation to the envelope s removal by feedback .",
    "we found for all three clouds that the removal of the envelope led to drastically lower levels of structure forming within the cloud while the external layers expanded .",
    "this naturally also caused the average densities to fall .",
    "as such it became harder for gas to become self gravitating and the levels of star formation fell .",
    "the star formation efficiencies ( sfes ) were calculated as a function of time . for all pairs of simulations ( with and without the envelope ) , those which retained the envelope showed higher levels of star formation . at a fiducial time of @xmath46 ,",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath2 clouds retaining the envelope showed sfes higher by factors of 1.7 to 2.7 compared to the runs in which it was lost .",
    "the @xmath1 simulations ran until a much later time and by @xmath69 the discrepancy was even higher with sfes of @xmath70 falling to @xmath71 with the loss of the envelope .",
    "the @xmath3 cloud was the most unbound .",
    "at the same time of @xmath72 , it had an sfe of @xmath73 when the envelope was present . in its counterpart which lost the envelope ,",
    "no star formation whatsoever took place .    considering the star formation efficiencies per free - fall time ( sfe@xmath74 ) and plotting these against @xmath6 shows the simulations to be nearly a full sequence , with the @xmath3 cloud with an envelope falling on almost the same point as the @xmath1 cloud lacking an envelope , despite the larger cloud having @xmath47 times the mass of the smaller .",
    "we also ran a set of simulations derived from the @xmath1 cloud in which the envelope was removed at later times . even when it was lost as late as @xmath54",
    ", the sfe fell away to a slope resembling those simulations which had lost the envelope at an earlier stage . in the runs in which the envelope was removed",
    "after star formation had begun , the sfe only responded to the loss after a short period of time of at most @xmath57 .",
    "a more realistic form of feedback may have brought about less extreme changes in the sfe than those reported here .",
    "for example , the envelope could have been lost only partially across some small solid angle , leading perhaps to the cloud s expansion through the new opening as a cold outflow . or",
    ", the envelope could have been lost slowly rather than removed instantaneously . however , the end state would have still resembled one of the simulations in which the envelope was removed at a later time .",
    "this implies that even then a drop in the sfe would be inevitable .",
