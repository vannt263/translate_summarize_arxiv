    "we will discuss the regime @xmath94 introducing effects of the magnetic field h. when @xmath95 , one does not find magnetic entanglement in the system .",

    "@xcite find these values ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "we can see from figure ( 5 ) that for all quantum correlations which we consider in this parer , critical values of magnetic field coincide each other approximately .",
    "however , we compare this situation with the case in which @xmath0 , @xmath101 does not coincide with the saturation field ( see section 6 ) .",
    "the certain case @xmath83 is interesting , because we can see here magnetic entanglement with different values ( @xmath85 and @xmath102 ) ( figure ( 6 ) ) , while in the case of @xmath0 , these two regimes can not coexist for a fixed values of j and @xmath103 and only one sudden transition occurs .",
    "it is noticeable that , the behavior of quantum discord is similar to entanglement which measure by concurrence and again two sudden transition appear .",
    "however , we can observe here for quantum discord two transition take place with different values @xmath85 and @xmath104 .",
    "remarkably , gmqd has similar behavior to two above mentioned measures , only it show lesser value than the others . by comparison of quantum correlations in figures(7 ) and",
    "( 8) which plotted versus magnetic field and temperature , we can see that again like as the previous section entanglement sudden death occurs while quantum discord and gmqd decrease asymptotically .",

    "we have studied the quantum correlations properties for a s=1/2 ising- heisenberg model on a symmetrical diamond chain .",
    "we see that quantum correlations for an ideal diamond chain show symmetrical behavior respect to coupling constant in every temperature in both ferromagnetic and anti- ferromagnetic region .",

    "the observations are not in agreement with the previous information . as regard to the influence of temperature ,",
    "one find that the higher the temperature is , the smaller quantum correlations are .",
