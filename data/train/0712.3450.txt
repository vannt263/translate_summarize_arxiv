    "it is conceivable that the observations will converge on a value of @xmath0 very close to , but not exactly equal to , @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", we must consider how such a dark energy equation of state might arise .",
    "one possibility , dubbed quintessence , is a model in which the dark energy arises from a scalar field @xcite .",
    "caldwell and linder @xcite showed that quintessence models in which the scalar field potential asymptotically approaches zero can be divided naturally into two categories , which they dubbed  freezing \" and  thawing \" models , with quite different behaviors .",
    "thawing models have a value of @xmath0 which begins near @xmath1 and increases with time , while freezing models have a value of @xmath0 which decreases with time , with an asymptotic value that depends on the shape of the potential .",

    "thawing models with a nearly flat potential provide a natural way to produce a value of @xmath0 that is close to , but not exactly equal to @xmath1 , since the field begins with @xmath14 , and @xmath0 increases only slightly up to the present .",
    "furthermore , with a nearly flat potential and @xmath14 , the dynamics of quintessence are considerably simplified . in this paper , we show that all such models converge to a single unique evolution .",
    "in addition to providing a plausible model for @xmath0 near @xmath1 , such models ( since they all converge to a single type of behavior ) can serve as a useful set of fiducial models that can be compared to @xmath15cdm .    in the next section ,",
    "we reexamine thawing quintessence models and outline the arguments for these models . in sec . 3",

    "in sec . 4 , we discuss the arguments against thawing quintessence models .",
    "our conclusions are summarized briefly in sec .",
    "we will assume that the dark energy is provided by a minimally - coupled scalar field , @xmath16 , with equation of motion given by @xmath17 where the hubble parameter @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 here @xmath11 is the scale factor , @xmath20 is the total density , and we work in units for which @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ motionq ] ) indicates that the field rolls downhill in the potential @xmath22 , but its motion is damped by a term proportional to @xmath18 .    the pressure and density of the scalar field are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , and the equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , is given by equation ( [ w ] ) .    as noted above",
    ", observations suggest a value of @xmath0 near @xmath1 .",
    "caldwell and linder @xcite noted there are basically two ways to achieve such a result ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of some of these issues ) . in the first case ,",
    "freezing potentials , the field is initially rolling down the potential with @xmath25 , but it slows with time , driving @xmath0 toward @xmath1 .",
    "( as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tracking models introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite are a subset of freezing models , but not all freezing models display tracking behavior ) . in thawing models ,",
    "the field is initially nearly frozen at some value @xmath26 , with @xmath27 .",
    "then as @xmath18 decreases , the field rolls down the potential , and @xmath0 increases with time .",
    "it is possible to produce @xmath0 near @xmath1 at the present using either freezing or thawing models .",
    "chongchitnan and efstathiou @xcite used monte carlo simulations to derive a set of potentials that yield @xmath0 very close to @xmath1 today .",
    "they found two classes of acceptable solutions : very flat potentials , and models in which the field evolves from a region with very steep slope in the potential to a region in which the potential is roughly flat .",
    "while neither type of model can be ruled out , we feel that the models with a nearly flat potential are clearly a more natural way to produce the desired present - day value of @xmath0 near @xmath1 .",
    "a similar naturalness issue was raised by bludman @xcite , who argued that the only way to achieve tracking models with @xmath0 near @xmath1 today was for the model to contain a sharp change in the curvature of the potential at the present .",
    "thus , we are presented with a double coincidence problem : why should the field be entering this special region of the potential at the same time that the dark energy is coming to dominate the matter , and why are both of these happening right now ? in thawing models with a nearly flat potential , on the other hand , @xmath0 never deviates very far from @xmath1 .",
    "another argument in favor of these thawing models is that we already have strong evidence that the universe at one time underwent a period of vacuum energy domination ( inflation ) .",
    "many models for inflation correspond to the sort of thawing models examined here @xcite ; the scalar field initially has @xmath28 , but then rolls downhill to terminate inflation .    finally , griest @xcite has suggested a solution to the coincidence problem involving thawing fields . in his model ,",
    "the universe contains a variety of scalar fields with various initial energy scales @xmath29 . as the matter or radiation density drops below a given @xmath30 , the universe undergoes a period of dark energy domination , but the field then thaws and slides down the potential , allowing matter or radiation to dominate again .",
    "given enough of these fields , it would not be suprising to find ourselves in an epoch in which one of them is just beginning to dominate at present ( see also the somewhat different model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "none of these arguments proves , of course , that a universe with @xmath0 close to @xmath1 ( but not equal to @xmath1 ) must involve a thawing quintessence field with a nearly flat potential .",
    "however , they do indicate that such models are worthy of further study .",
    "we will assume a scalar field with initial value @xmath26 in a nearly flat potential @xmath22 .",
    "specifically , we will assume that at @xmath31 , the field satisfies the slow - roll conditions : @xmath32 and @xmath33 the latter condition corresponds to a mass scale @xmath34 .",
    "setting @xmath35 roughly equal to the dark energy density at the present , we get @xmath36 ev .",
    "this is the same ( unnaturally small ) mass that occurs generically in quintessence models for dark energy .    in analyzing models for inflation",
    ", it is usually assumed that the scalar field dominates the expansion , and that @xmath37 . with these assumptions , along with the flatness of the potential given by equations ( [ slow1 ] ) and ( [ slow2 ] ) , it can be shown that the @xmath38 term in equation ( [ motionq ] ) can be neglected , yielding the simple equation @xmath39 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this is called the slow - roll approximation .",
    "it is well - known that the slow - roll approximation fails for the case of quintessence @xcite .",
    "the basic reason is that the slow - roll approximation requires the scalar field to dominate the expansion .",
    "however , this is never the case for quintessence , since matter always contributes significantly to the total density .",
    "however , nothing prevents us from assuming the slow roll conditions on the potential ( equations [ slow1 ] and [ slow2 ] ) along with the requirement that @xmath0 be close to @xmath1 today .",
    "effectively , we are deriving the analog of the slow - roll approximation for the case where the expansion is not dominated by the scalar field .    at the late times which are of interest here",

    "<S> the thawing quintessence model with a nearly flat potential provides a natural mechanism to produce an equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , close to @xmath1 today . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the behavior of such models for the case in which the potential satisfies the slow roll conditions : @xmath2 ^ 2 \\ll 1 $ ] and @xmath3 , and we derive the analog of the slow - roll approximation for the case in which both matter and a scalar field contribute to the density . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this limit , all such models converge to a unique relation between @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the initial value of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive this relation , and use it to determine the corresponding expression for @xmath7 , which depends only on the present - day values for @xmath0 and @xmath5 . for a variety of potentials , </S>",
    "<S> our limiting expression for @xmath7 is typically accurate to within @xmath8 for @xmath9 . for redshift @xmath10 </S>",
