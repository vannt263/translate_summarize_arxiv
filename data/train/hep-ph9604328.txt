    "the top quark is the heaviest known elementary object .",
    "precision studies of its interactions will lead to profound progress in particle physics and may open an exciting new window towards the very high mass scale .",

    "such a system will provide a unique opportunity for a variety of novel qcd studies .",
    "it is likely that precise studies of top quark production and decays will reveal new important information on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the analysis of polarized top quarks and their decays has recently attracted considerable attention @xcite . for nonrelativistic top",
    "quarks the polarization studies are free from hadronization ambiguities .",
    "this is due to the short lifetime of the top quark which competes favorably with the formation time of top mesons and toponium resonances .",
    "therefore top decays interrupt the process of hadronization at an early stage and practically eliminate associated non - perturbative effects .",
    "threshold production of top quarks at a future electron - positron collider will allow to study their properties with extremely high precision .",
    "the dynamics of the top quark is strongly influenced by its large width @xmath7 gev .",
    "individual quarkonium resonances can no longer be resolved , hadronization effects are irrelevant and an effective cutoff of the large distance ( small momentum ) part of the hadronic interaction is introduced @xcite .",
    "this in turn allows to measure the short distance part of the potential , leading to a precise determination of the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the total cross section combined with the top quark momentum distribution will determine its mass @xmath8 with an accuracy of at least 300 mev and its width @xmath9 to about 10% .",
    "for a higgs boson mass of order 100 gev even the @xmath10 yukawa coupling could be indirectly deduced from its contribution to the vertex correction @xcite .",
    "additional constraints on these parameters can be derived from the forward - backward asymmetry of top quarks and from measurements of the top quark spin .",
    "close to threshold , for @xmath11 , the total cross section and similarly the momentum distribution of the quarks are essentially governed by the @xmath2-wave amplitude , with @xmath3-waves suppressed @xmath12 . the forward - backward asymmetry and , likewise ,",
    "the transverse component of the top quark spin originate from the interference between @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave amplitudes and are , therefore , of order @xmath13 even close to threshold .",
    "note that the expectation value of the momentum is always different from zero as a consequence of the large top width and the uncertainty principle , even for @xmath14 .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the green function technique is particularly suited to calculate the total cross section in the threshold region .",
    "the method has been extended to predict the top quark momentum distribution .",
    "independent approaches have been developed for solving the schrdinger equation in position space @xcite and the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the results of these two methods agree very well .",
    "one of the most important future applications will be the determination of @xmath8 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a further generalization then leads to the inclusion of @xmath3-waves and , as a consequence , allows to predict the forward - backward asymmetry @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the same function @xmath16 which results from the @xmath2-@xmath3wave interference governs the dynamical behaviour of the forward - backward asymmetry as well as the angular dependence of the transverse part of the top quark polarization .",
    "the close relation between this result and the tree level prediction , expanded up to linear terms in @xmath17 , has been emphasized .",
    "the relative importance of @xmath18 versus @xmath19 and of axial versus vector couplings depend on the electron ( and/or positron ) beam polarization .",
    "all predictions can , therefore , be further tested by exploiting their dependence on beam polarization .",
    "in fact the reaction @xmath20 with longitudinally polarized beams is the most efficient and flexible source of polarized top quarks . at the same time the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam",
    "is an obvious option for a future linear collider .    in the present article",
    "the polarization dependent angular and momentum distributions of top quarks are studied ( neglecting effects of @xmath21 violation , the corresponding distributions for @xmath22 antiquark can be obtained through a @xmath21 transformation ) and the results of @xcite are expanded in three directions :    * _ normal polarization .",
    "_ the calculation of the polarization normal to the production plane is a straightforward extension of the previous work @xcite .",
    "it is based on the same nonrelativistic green function as before , involving , however , the imaginary part of the interference term @xmath23 .",
    "a component of the top quark polarization normal to the production plane may also be induced by time reversal odd components of the @xmath24- or @xmath25-coupling with an electric dipole moment as most prominent example .",
    "such an effect would be a clear signal for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the relative sign of particle versus antiparticle polarizations is opposite for the qcd - induced and the @xmath26-odd terms respectively which allows to discriminate between the two effects .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that a complete understanding of the qcd - induced component is mandatory for a convincing analysis of the @xmath26-odd contribution . *",
    "_ rescattering of decay products .",
    "_ both @xmath27 quark and @xmath22 antiquark are unstable and decay into @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "neither @xmath30 nor @xmath31 can be considered as freely propagating particles .",
    "rescattering in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 systems affects not only the momenta of the decay products but also the polarization of the top quark .",
    "moreover , in the latter case , when the top quark decays first and its colored decay product @xmath30 is rescattered in a coulomb - like chromostatic potential of the spectator @xmath22 , the top polarization is not a well defined quantity .",
    "instead one can consider other observables , like the angular momentum of the @xmath34 subsystem , which coincides with the spin of top quark if rescattering is absent .",
    "rescattering corrections are suppressed by @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting modifications of the momentum distribution are , therefore , minor and as far as the total cross section is concerned can even be shown to vanish @xcite .",
    "in contrast the forward - backward asymmetry as well as the transverse and normal parts of the top quark spin are suppressed by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "hence they are relatively more sensitive towards rescattering corrections .",
    "the treatment of rescattering follows to some extent the formalism of @xcite .",
    "however , instead of the coulomb potential we employ the full qcd potential .",
    "+ the lifetime of the @xmath1 system is about @xmath36 . at the time of the decay of the first constituent the typical potential energy of @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 )",
    "is about @xmath37 where the approximate identity between the two quantities is a numerical coincidence valid for @xmath8 of about 180 gev .",
    "at the time of the second ( spectator ) decay the mean separation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 has increased to @xmath9 and the corresponding potential energy is reduced to @xmath38 . thus",
    ", rescattering in the @xmath39 system is less important and will be neglected . * _ moments of the lepton angular distribution . _",
    "the direction of the charged lepton in semileptonic decays is optimally suited to analyze the polarization of the top quark @xcite .",
    "the reason is @xcite that in the top quark rest frame the double differential energy - angular distribution of the charged lepton is a product of the energy and the angular dependent factors .",
    "the angular dependence is of the form @xmath40 , where @xmath3 denotes the top quark polarization and @xmath41 is the angle between the polarization three - vector and the direction of the charged lepton .",
    "gluon radiation and virtual corrections in the top quark decay practically do not affect these welcome properties @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to perform polarization studies by measuring the inclusive distributions of say @xmath42 in the process @xmath43 .",
    "this can be also convenient from the experimental point of view because there is no missing energy - momentum for the @xmath22 subsystem . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the direction of the charged lepton is advantageous since it is equivalent to the top quark polarization when rescattering is absent and remains defined even after @xmath33 rescattering is included .",
    "however , the semi - analytic calculation of this effect is difficult because production and decay mechanisms are coupled . in this article moments of experimentally measurable distributions",
    "are proposed which are less difficult to calculate but still retain the important information on top quark polarization .",
    "these moments , the mean values @xmath4 of the charged lepton four - momentum projections in semileptonic top decays are calculated including @xmath2-@xmath3wave interference and @xmath44 rescattering corrections .",

    "[ technic_sec ] the relations between the momentum , angular and spin distributions of top quarks and @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave green functions are established .",

    "the dependence on the various input parameters and the effects of rescattering are studied .",
    "various technical aspects are relegated into the appendices .",
    "top quark production in the threshold region is conveniently described by the green function method which allows to introduce in a natural way the effects of the large top decay rate @xmath9 and avoids the summation of many overlapping resonances .",
    "the total cross section can be obtained from the imaginary part of the green function @xmath47 via the optical theorem .",
    "to predict the differential momentum distribution , however , the complete @xmath48-dependence of @xmath49 ( or , more precisely , its fourier transform ) is required . in a calculation with non - interacting quarks close to threshold the forward - backward asymmetry ,",
    "the angular dependent term ( @xmath50 ) of the longitudinal part and the transverse part of the top quark polarization are all proportional to the quark velocity @xmath17 and originate from the interference of an @xmath2-wave with a @xmath3-wave amplitude .",

    "the subsequent discussion follows these lines .",
    "it includes , however , also the spin degrees of freedom and is , furthermore , formulated sufficiently general such that it is immediately applicable to other reactions of interest .",
    "the main ingredient in the derivation of the nonrelativistic limit is the ladder approximation for the vertex function @xmath52 .",
    "this vertex function is the solution of the following integral equation ( fig .",

    "the four - momenta are related to the nonrelativistic variables by @xmath56 in perturbation theory the ladder approximation is motivated by the observation that for each additional rung the energy denominator after loop integration compensates the coupling constant attached to the gluon propagator .",
    "this is demonstrated most easily in coulomb gauge",
    ". contributions from transverse gluons as well as those from other diagrams are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath57 .",
