    "nonlinear first order hyperbolic equations are often used in applications to describe crowd dynamics , for example pedestrian flows @xcite , or dynamics of populations which are heterogenous in respect to some individual property ( physiologically structured population models ) @xcite .",
    "the problems often lead to the models with nonlocal terms reflecting the impact of the whole population on birth and death processes of each individual @xcite or on the velocity of the individual movement @xcite .",
    "recently , such problems have been also studied using methods originated from kinetic theory and related to them metrics , such as wasserstein and monge - kantorovich metrics @xcite .",
    "the idea of representing a heterogeneous population as a sum of masses concentrated in different points of the structure follows from empirical understanding of the data obtained in measurements taken place in discrete time points .",
    "the choice of spaces of positive radon measures was proposed in @xcite as relevant for biological applications , in which the initial distribution of individuals is concentrated with respect to the structure , i.e. is not absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure .    a framework for the analysis of solutions of structured population models using wasserstein type metrics , adjusted to the nonconservative character of the considered problem , has been proposed in @xcite using a flat metric ( bounded lipschitz distance ) and in @xcite using a wasserstein type metric adjusted to spaces of nonnegative radon measures with integrable first moment .",
    "the advantage of that approach is in providing a structure of a space appropriate to compare solutions and to study their stability . among others ,",
    "continuous dependence with respect to the modeling ingredients is important in the context of numerical approximation and model calibration based on experimental data .    in the current paper",
    "we focus on the classical nonlinear renewal equation with a nonlocal boundary condition given by @xmath0 with nonnegative parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 and a strictly positive @xmath3 .",
    "this model has served as a test case for the analysis of solutions in spaces of positive radon measures developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the result on lipschitz continuous dependence of solutions on the model parameters and initial data was then extended using a split - up method to the size - structured population models , i.e involving nonlocal terms in the equation @xcite , and to systems of equations in @xcite . as mentioned in @xcite",
    "the constructive proofs of lipschitz continuous dependence of measure - valued solutions in respect to time and initial data provide a good tool to study convergence of the numerical algorithms based on particle methods .",
    "recently , a numerical approach based on the split - up algorithm was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the split - up algorithm is based on the idea of representing a semigroup defining the model solution as a product of two semigroups related to equations with simpler structure . in case of model",
    "it allows for reduction of the problem involving transport terms and nonlocal growth terms to two problems involving either one or the other process .",

    "the method is based on representing the solution as a sum of masses localized in discrete points and tracing their spatio - temporal evolution .",

    "the novelty of this work is in analysis of the two versions of ebt method . since the original ebt algorithm is based on solving a system of ordinary differential equations with non - lipschitz and even non - continuous right hand side , its well - posedness does not follow from a standard theory .",
