    "<S> convergence increases to lower @xmath25 , with decreasing @xmath38 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that as @xmath25 drops below the hump in @xmath0 , @xmath52 displays a plateau - like region , whose value increases steadily with increasing @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> _  we suggest that a double - peaked @xmath0 with an entropy between the peaks comparable to @xmath5 is the hallmark of an exchange quantum spin ice ( qsi ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , one is unlikely to find an exact plateau at @xmath35 outside the perturbative ( small @xmath38 ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> such a double - peaked structure and quasi - separation of the energy / temperature scales associated with short and long - range physics has also been suggested for other systems where quantum spin liquid physics may apply @xcite .    according to the gauge mean - field theory of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , at low temperature below which short - range spin ice correlations develop , a system may exhibit either a conventional ferrimagnetic ( fm ) order , a coulombic ferromagnet ( cfm ) or a full - blown quantum spin - liquid ( qsl ) , depending on its quantum exchange parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the largest quantum exchange terms in ybto is @xmath39 , which favors the fm state , which we believe is the origin of the 0.24 k transition in the best samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen if there are real materials for which @xmath60 , which favors the qsl @xcite , is the dominant quantum term . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , even when the ground state is fm , the excitations remain highly exotic , consisting of spinon - antispinon pairs separated by long strings . </S>",
    "<S> this non - trivial feature is derived from the underlying spin - ice physics . finally , as one notes that @xmath39 is strictly zero for non - kramers ions ( e.g. pr , tb ) and that virtual crystal field excitations @xcite in tb - based pyrochlores are a fundamentally different pathway from anisotropic superexchange @xcite to generate anisotropic @xmath61 couplings between effective spins one - half @xcite , the prospect to ultimately find a qsi - based qsl among rare - earth pyrochlores @xcite is perhaps promising .    </S>",
