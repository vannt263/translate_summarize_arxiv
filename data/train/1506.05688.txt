    "social networks are common in nature and show a fascinating variety of complex , collective behaviors .",
    "they occur in systems that range from the microscopic to the gigantic , e.g. , quorum sensing bacteria millerbassler01 , colonies of ants @xcite , starling murmurations swarms , and whale pods @xcite .",
    "often , the ` bonds ' between individuals are not directly observable , and so properties of the ` network ' must be inferred from the _ correlated _ behavior of individuals .",
    "thus , understanding the properties of social networks poses serious challenges . among all such networks",
    ", human social networks are arguably the most complex . to describe them adequately and appropriately",
    "is already extremely difficult , let alone understanding them and predicting their evolution    in this effort , the study of simple models that show some collective effects can be quite instructive .",
    "this is also a prerequisite for tackling more complex and realistic models . in this spirit",
    ", this article is devoted to a simple model of a _ dynamic _ social network which incorporates the notion that a person tends to add ( cut ) contacts when they have fewer ( more ) than they would like to have . for simplicity",
    ", we will model this tendency by assigning a number to each node , @xmath1 , the _",
    "preferred degree_. of course , @xmath1 can vary from one individual to another and also , from time to time .",
    "the value of @xmath1 may be determined internally or imposed externally .",
    "examples of the former include introverts who prefer few friends _ vs. _ extroverts who prefer many , while medical quarantine is a good example of the latter .",
    "incorporating some randomness in the actions of individuals , the network would undergo a stochastic evolution .",
    "what are the statistical properties of such a network ( e.g. , degree distribution ) ?",
    "are they mundane ? or surprising ?",
    "are some properties more robust , independent of details of evolution rules , similar to the universality seen in equilibrium phase transitions ?    as a first step",
    ", we consider the behavior of a homogeneous population , in which everyone has the same , time - independent @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , the general population is more diverse , characterized by a distribution of @xmath2s , and with some variability in time .",
    "thus , our next step is to introduce diversity in the simplest way : each individual , or agent , has one of two @xmath1s .",
    "for such a system , we may refer to the two subgroups as ` introverts ' ( @xmath3 ) and ` extroverts ' ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath5 . even in this simple model",
    ", there are very many ways to couple the two ` communities ' together .",
    "what can we learn from the different ways one subculture interacts with another ?",
    "in the rest of this article , we will describe a number of reasonably realistic scenarios , though we will study in detail only a few .",
    "not surprisingly , some aspects of the collective behavior , first seen in simulations , can be understood with hindsight , while others may appear to be counter - intuitive and are quite difficult to analyze .",
    "once a few baselines are established and understood , generalizations can be incorporated and more complex models can be investigated .    though we will focus only on the properties of a fluctuating network in which the nodes have no degrees of freedom , realistic and interesting social structures can consist of nodes with their own variables , e.g. , health , wealth , and opinion .",
    "frequently , these degrees of freedom feed back to the dynamics of the network . for example",
    ", a sick individual is more likely to stay home and so , have fewer contacts than when he / she recovers .",
    "we can model such situations by letting @xmath1 be _ dependent _ on the state of the person .",
    "alternatively , a healthy individual may prefer to stay home when he / she learns of an ongoing epidemic in the community . in this case",
    ", we let @xmath1 depend on the state of the whole population @xcite .",
    "such , so - called , adaptive networks , in which the nodes and the links ` co - evolve , ' describe many important biological and social systems @xcite . here",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to systems with ` static nodes and dynamic links . ' in this vein , we should mention that , in theoretical condensed matter physics , conventional studies deal with ` dynamic nodes and static links . ' for example , in the textbook ising model , the network that specifies the interactions is fixed ( typically , a regular lattice in some dimension ) . even in theories of strongly correlated electrons , the interactions between them",
    "do not fluctuate randomly as a function of the state of the electrons .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section 2 is devoted to a brief review , highlighting the more surprising aspects of our discoveries in csp24,csp25,liuschmittmannzia12,liujoladschzia13,liuschzia14,basslerlsz15,wjlthesis .",
    "this review , including the material in appendix a , is designed pedagogically for students and non - experts , exposing the basic formulation of dynamic networks , as well as certain principal characteristics of the non - equilibrium stationary states they settle into . for completeness",
    ", we first provide detailed descriptions of the dynamics of networks with preferred degree and the master equation associated with the stochastic process .",
    "these involve a baseline model ( a homogeneous population ) , as well as somewhat more realistic systems with two subgroups , interacting via a variety of ways . discovered through simulations , much of the statistical properties of various degree distributions ( a standard observable associated with networks ) can be understood through simple arguments and mean - field approaches . in this effort",
    ", the study of a particular limiting case of the above has been particularly rewarding .",
    "consisting of etreme ntroverts and xtroverts who prefer contact with no one and everyone , respectively , it has been called the @xmath6 model . for this special , analytically tractable limit",
    ", we found the exact stationary distribution , as well as good approximations for most degree distributions .",
    "more significantly , this system exhibits the characteristics of both a first and second order transition .",
    "known as the thouless effect thouless , aize88,luij01 , which has been observed only in equilibrium systems @xcite , the order parameter suffers a discontinuity across the transition and displays anomalously large fluctuations .",
    "indeed , our system shown an extreme form of this effect @xcite , as our equivalent of the magnetisation jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , while wandering over the entire interval @xmath9 $ ] at the transition . in section 3 , we show that , in the limit of large number of agents ( @xmath10 ) and away from phase transitions , the @xmath6 model becomes exactly soluble , as the agents in the majority become effectively independent , with residual interactions vanishing as @xmath11 .",
    "we also provide a scaling theory for the fluctuations in a certain neighborhood , or scaling window , of the critical point . in section 4 , we introduce two variants of the @xmath6 model , where the agents are more selective with which links to add or cut .",
    "novel behavior of the steady states are discovered through simulations , some of which can be understood theoretically .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook in section 5 .",
    "in all the models described in this article , we consider a population of @xmath10 individuals ( labelled by @xmath12 ) , each associated with a preferred degree @xmath13 .",
    "we begin with systems in which the agents are not endowed with any degree of freedom , so that only the connections between them are dynamic - i.e. , static nodes and dynamic links .",
    "the network , specified by an adjacency matrix @xmath14 ( with elements @xmath15 if nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 are connected or not , respectively , and @xmath18 to exclude self loops ) , evolves as follows : at each time step , a random agent is chosen and its degree , @xmath19 , is noted .",
    "if @xmath20 , it chooses randomly one of its links to cut . otherwise , it adds a link to a randomly chosen partner not already connected to it .",
    "links do nothing . ]",
    "this rule , though not so realistic , models the individual s attempt to restore its degree towards the preferred @xmath1 . of course , we can soften this ` rigid ' rule , by specifying smoother functions of @xmath21 for the probabilities @xmath22 , with which the agent will add / cut a link , given that it has @xmath21 and prefers @xmath1 . however , for most of the models we study in detail , we will use the rigid rule , for simplicity .",
    "thus , the total number of links in the system changes by unity at each time step ( for @xmath23 ) . the stochastic process of the entire network is described in terms of @xmath24 , which is the probability of finding configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath25 , given an initial configuration @xmath26 .",
    "as our main interest is in stationary states , we can ignore the initial state and simplify our notation to @xmath27 .",
    "the rules governing its evolution are embodied in a discrete master equation : @xmath28where @xmath29 is the probability for configuration @xmath14 to change to @xmath30 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath31 is @xcite",
    "@xmath32   \\label{rs}\\]]where @xmath33 ensures that only @xmath34 changes ( @xmath35 being the kronecker delta ) and @xmath36is the heaviside function , modelling the ` rigid ' adding / cutting behavior .",
    "given the explicit rates , the entire stochastic process is specified .",
    "since these rates are _ not _ based on some physical process governed by a hamiltonian , it is important to ask if they satisfy detailed balance or not .",
    "if they do , then the stationary distribution , @xmath37 , can be readily constructed . otherwise , finding @xmath37 is , in general , highly non - trivial @xcite . in our case , with neither hamiltonian nor temperature , detailed balance can be checked via the kolmogorov criterion kolmogorov36 : a set of @xmath38s satisfies detailed balance if and only if the product of @xmath38s around _ any _ closed loop in configuration space is equal to that around the reversed loop .",
    "since it is easy to check that this is not satisfied for some ` elementary closed loops ' ( i.e. , the operation of adding a link @xmath39 , then a link @xmath40 , then deleting @xmath39 , then deleting @xmath40 ) @xcite , we conclude that despite its apparent simplicity , the model is non - trivial .",
    "a significant implication of detailed balance violation is the presence of non - trivial , stationary probability currents , @xmath41 , even in the stationary state .",
    "as pointed out earlier @xcite , while the ( time - independent ) properties of an equilibrium system are completely specified by the steady state distribution @xmath42 , we need to specify the pair @xmath43 to describe a _",
    "non - equilibrium _ steady state . in appendix",
    "a , we work out in detail the case of a small network with just four nodes , mainly for pedagogical purposes : examining every elementary loop , showing that many do not satisfy the kolmogorov condition , and determining @xmath43 explicitly .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is simple to perform monte carlo simulations and to discover possibly interesting phenomena . for many of the quantities we study ,",
    "the qualitative trends can be easily guessed .",
    "apart from such ` mundane ' results , some of these models do produce surprising collective behavior .",
    "reliable approximation schemes have been devised , so that some of these less obvious behaviors can also be understood reasonably well .",
    "we discuss these below .",
    "while any realistic population will display a distribution of @xmath1s , it is reasonable to begin with a baseline study  a system in which every agent shares the same @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that , due to the violation of detailed balance , the stationary distribution @xmath44 can not be easily found . nevertheless , every expectation is that the average degree is near @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , given the randomness and homogeneity in the system , a naive guess might be that the stationary ensemble is just the erds - rnyi graphs @xcite . in that case",
    ", the degree distribution , @xmath45 , is well known : binomial ( i.e. , gaussian or poisson , in the appropriate limit of large @xmath10 ) .    to our surprise , from simulating a typical case with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , this system displays , to an excellent approximation , a _",
    "distribution : @xmath48 $ ] . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ homodd ] , if we ` soften ' the updating rules to the less rigid @xmath49 , we find a more rounded peak at @xmath1 but the exponential tails persist .",
    "these features can be understood through a simple argument : consider an agent with @xmath50 and the probability that its degree will increase or decrease by one in an attempt .",
    "the former will happen only if one of the other agents adds a link ( to it ) . in the steady state , let us assume the partner is equally likely to have too many or too few links .",
    "so , the probability for adding is @xmath51 . for our individual to lose a link , the argument for this @xmath52 also applies .",
    "but , if it is chosen , it will cut for sure .",
    "balancing the rates for an agent with @xmath21 links to gain or lose one , we are led to the rough estimate@xmath53 \\rho \\left ( k+1\\right )   \\label{homorb}\\]]a similar argument for @xmath54 leads us to @xmath55 . in the limit of large @xmath56 with fixed @xmath57 ,",
    "this argument becomes exact .",
    "to understand simulation data with less rigid rules ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ homodd ] ) , our argument can be repeated . in this case , the coefficients above becomes @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the agreement with data is reasonably good , as illustrated in the figure .",
    "needless to say , as @xmath1 nears the two extremes  @xmath60 and @xmath10 , the distribution will be distorted from a laplacian .",
    "proceeding to heterogeneous populations , the next simplest step is to introduce two subgroups ( or communities , labelled by @xmath61 or @xmath62 ) with various distinguishing properties @xcite .",
    "obviously , the parameter space becomes 4-dimensional @xmath63 . with typically unequal @xmath1s",
    ", we label the the group with smaller(larger ) @xmath1 introverts(extroverts ) . to model",
    "_ interactions _ between the communities , there are not only many possibilities but also subtle and complex issues . in this review , we will focus mainly on two variations : the generic ( @xmath64 ) and the extreme ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "though the former is more realistic , the latter is more tractable analytically and will be the focus of the rest of this article .",
    "as will be shown , even when restricted to @xmath6 , drastically different collective behavior emerge when different actions on the links are introduced . in the following sections , we will study three variants . to distinguish them from the proto model",
    ", we will refer to them as blind , egalitarian , and elitist xie models , labelled respectively by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .    turning to the generic @xmath64 model with two distinct communities , it is natural to specify an individual s preference for cutting / adding a _ intra_-group link _ vs. _ a cross - link ( a link to a partner in the other group ) .",
    "the simplest way is to define @xmath68 , the probability that an agent in subgroup @xmath69 will choose a cross - link for action . to illustrate ,",
    "suppose an introvert with degree larger than @xmath70 is chosen , then it will cut a random cross - link with probability @xmath71 or , with probability @xmath72 , a random link to individuals within the group .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 represents how likely an agent interacts with a member from the other community .",
    "thus , a @xmath74 system ( initialized with @xmath75 ) breaks up into two non - interacting , homogeneous networks .",
    "the @xmath76 limit here is also interesting , as the intra - links remain absent , so that only bipartite graphs are present and the adjacency matrix reduces to the smaller @xmath77 -dimensional incidence matrix @xmath78 . in either limit",
    ", a non - vanishing @xmath79 can play a significant role , since the inactive sector(s ) of @xmath80 are equivalent to decreasing the effective @xmath1s of agents by different amounts .",
    "due to such complications , we have not explored these limits so far .",
    "instead , we study several generic points in the 6-dimensional space @xmath81 .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , we find certain expected properties with typical @xmath73s .",
    "the degree distributions of each subgroup are similar to those of homogeneous populations : laplacians around their own @xmath1s .",
    "exceptions appear when there is a large level of ` frustration ' liuschzia14 , i.e. , when neither community can maintain link numbers close to their preferred @xmath1s .",
    "for example , with @xmath82 say , the extroverts will find themselves creating many links with the introverts ( roughly @xmath83 ) .",
    "if @xmath84 is much less than this value , the introverts will struggle to cut these links , leading to serious ` frustration . ' to illustrate , consider a population with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the extroverts will attempt to reach 45 links each , with about half of them ( @xmath87 4000 ) directed towards just 10 introverts .",
    "not surprisingly , while the extrovert majority are content , the few introverts will be overwhelmed and can not achieve their preferred level of just 5 contacts .",
    "this dichotomy is well illustrated in fig .",
    ". here , @xmath88 ( red triangle , @xmath89 in figure ) displays the familiar laplacian around @xmath90 , but @xmath91 ( blue diamond , @xmath92 in figure ) is closer to a gaussian , peaked far beyond @xmath93 ! remarkably , the latter depends mostly on the fact that @xmath94 and fairly independent of the details of the @xmath1s : fig .",
    "[ n1<<n2]b .",
    "this unexpected ` universal ' feature can be explained by solving a rate balance equation in the spirit of ( [ homorb ] ) above , @xmath95 , and making reasonable arguments to arrive at the transition probabilities ( @xmath38s ) @xcite .",
    "so far we have focused on the ordinary degree distributions ( @xmath96 ) of the two populations .",
    "when we extend our investigations to the distributions of inter- and intra - links ( @xmath97 ) , we find that they are essentially broad gaussians , even when @xmath96 are narrow laplacians .",
    "we illustrate this contrast for the introverts in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ threeis ] .",
    "monte carlo steps ( @xmath98 updates ) .",
    "they appear to be stable when run for a hundred times longer .",
    "that said , these states turn out to be quasi - stationary , as discussed later . ]",
    "this unusual combination can be understood by studying the _ joint _",
    "distributions @xmath99 , the probability that an @xmath69 agent has @xmath100 intra - community links and @xmath101 cross - links .",
    "these are related to the above @xmath102s by appropriate projections , e.g. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . visualizing @xmath105 as a landscape ( fig .",
    "[ threeis ] , lower panel ) , we see that it resembles a relatively flat half - disk ( thickness much less than diameter ) , upended and laid along the diagonal @xmath106 .",
    "then its profile along the diagonal appears sharp and narrow , while its projection onto either axis appears broad and rounded .",
    "however , though this scenario is adequate , we have yet to develop quantitative explanations for the partitions between intra- and cross - links ( e.g. , @xmath107 for the @xmath3s in fig .",
    "[ threeis]a ) and the widths of the gaussians .    ,",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",

    "white space indicates a probability of @xmath116.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    finally , we discuss one of the more unexpected features : the appearance of very large relaxation times in the system .",
    "consider the most symmetric of all possibilities : equal @xmath117s and @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , one might have guessed that this system is similar to a homogeneous population with @xmath119 . yet ,",
    "dramatic differences emerge .",
    "in particular , for systems with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , though cross - link distributions settle into gaussians quite rapidly ( starting with a null graph ) , the whole distribution wanders very slowly ( while mostly maintaining the shape ) .",
    "long simulations are required in order to study the steady state distributions in such systems @xcite . for convenience",
    ", we resort to much smaller networks ( @xmath122 ) in order to explore their properties systematically . to characterize this seemingly bizarre behavior , we chose to focus on a single , macroscopic quantity , @xmath123 , the total number of cross - links between the communities .",
    "with runs up to @xmath124 monte carlo steps , we find that @xmath123 traverses much of its expected range ( up to about @xmath125 ) , often enough for us to compile a reliable histogram from its time trace @xmath126 .",
    "of course , when normalized , this histogram provides us with @xmath127 , the probability distribution for @xmath123 . both this @xmath128 and the power spectrum associated with @xmath126 displays quantitatively the anomalous large scale wanderings observed @xcite .",
    "we found a broad plateau in @xmath128 for about a third of the interval @xmath129 $ ] , ( i.e. , standard deviation of @xmath130 ) , as well as a power spectrum that is consistent with that of a pure random walk , @xmath131 , down to a lower cut - off which corresponds to a characteristic time for a random walker to traverse the available range of @xmath123 .",
    "by contrast , consider a homogeneous population with @xmath132 , and arbitrarily label half of them white and the rest black . carrying out the simulations as before",
    ", we find the statistical properties of the total number of w - b links to be entirely ` normal . ' here , the @xmath128 is gaussian , peaked around @xmath133 with small standard deviation ( @xmath134 ) which is understandable through simple arguments .",
    "meanwhile , the power spectrum , being essentially constant , is consistent with that of white noise .",
    "let us emphasize that difference in the rules between these two models is seemingly trivial : in the latter model , a w agent with @xmath135 chooses to cut a random link , regardless of its being a w - b or w - w link .",
    "thus , the two sets of links are correlated , in the following sense .",
    "suppose there is a preponderance of w - b links , then it is more likely for one of those to be cut . in the interacting communities model",
    ", however , an agent first chooses , with equal probability , which set of links to take action . as a result ,",
    "the correlation is lost , so that each set is equally likely to lose a link , irrespective of the preponderance of one set of links .",
    "we need a better understanding for how the drastic differences in the collective behavior can emerge from such a minor changes in the rules .",
    "this need also drove us to explore simpler , limiting cases which may contain similar issues .",
    "one of these limits is an extreme scenario  the xie model . before discussing the special limit",
    ", we end this subsection with some generalizations .",
    "since these variants are mentioned only briefly here , we will not provide them with special names .",
    "though simplest , arguably , the rule with the @xmath73s does not represent the most natural human behavior .",
    "for example , if we imagine two groups with opposing political views ( e.g. , right / left ) and that they are rather intolerant , then a model with @xmath136 is not adequate : for example , when a right - winger is chosen to cut a link , it is much more likely for a cross - link to be cut . to model this kind of ` dislike ' , we would need four probabilities , @xmath137 for adding links and @xmath138 for cutting .",
    "another more realistic model is to introduce two sets of @xmath1s : @xmath139 which controls an @xmath69 agent s preference for links to individuals in community @xmath140 .",
    "thus , someone in group @xmath8 would prefer to have @xmath141 , @xmath142 intra- and inter - group links , respectively .",
    "a similar model is specified by preferred ratios of intra- _ vs. _ inter - group links , modelling an agent who is most comfortable with having , say , 3/4 of its contacts within the group and 1/4 to ` strangers . '",
    "many simulations on these variations have been performed @xcite , with most of the results being intuitively understandable and reasonably well described by rate balance relations like ( [ homorb ] ) .",
    "since the dynamics in both of these models involves preferred ` points ' in the space of intra- and inter - link degrees , the large scale wanderings found above are absent .",
    "in an effort to gain some insight into the most surprising feature in the two communities model above ( giant fluctuations and large scale wandering of @xmath123 ) , we were led to ask if this phenomenon exists in the model at an extreme limit : @xmath143 . here , an introvert / extrovert will always cut / add a link whenever possible .",
    "certain simplifications are immediately clear : in the steady state , there will be no links in the @xmath3-@xmath3 sector , while all links will be present in the @xmath4-@xmath4 sector .",
    "the only active links will be the cross - links .",
    "thus , the smaller incidence matrix @xmath78 can be used to characterize the network instead of the larger adjacency matrix @xmath14 .",
    "an element of @xmath144 , denoted by @xmath145 , is @xmath8 if the link between introvert @xmath16 and extrovert @xmath17 is present and @xmath60 otherwise .",
    "thus , the @xmath6 configuration space @xmath146 is identical to that of an ising model ( on a square lattice ) with@xmath147spins .",
    "further , given that no more than one @xmath145 is ` flipped ' in an attempt , its evolution resembles that in the kinetic ising model with single - spin - flip dynamics .",
    "the major difference is , given fixed @xmath1s , that the only control parameters here are @xmath148 .",
    "meanwhile , since the probability for @xmath149 to ` flip ' from @xmath8 to @xmath60 is associated with an @xmath3 being chosen , i.e. , @xmath150 , and similarly , @xmath151 for the reverse ` flip , ' it is natural for the variables@xmath152to play the role of magnetic field .. ] now , it is clear that @xmath153 here plays the role of the total magnetisation in the ising model : @xmath154 .",
    "thus , our interest here  how does the average @xmath155 depend on @xmath148  corresponds to the ising equation of state : @xmath156 as a function of @xmath157 .",
    "there is no obvious @xmath158 in our model , and we will return to this question later .",
    "to reiterate , the rules of @xmath6 are minimal indeed : choose a random individual ; if it is an @xmath3 , cut one of its links at random ; if it is an @xmath4 , add a link to a random partner not already connected ( to it ) .",
    "most remarkably , detailed balance is restored in this limit , so that the stationary state can be regarded as an ordinary equilibrium one and the distribution @xmath37 can be easily determined .",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath159where @xmath160 is a ` partition function , ' @xmath161 is the degree of @xmath16 , and @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) is the complement of @xmath164 , the degree of @xmath17 .",
    "we further note that the ising symmetry has an analogue here : @xmath165",
    "@xmath166 @xmath167 , referred to as ` particle - hole ' symmetry ( phs ) , which @xmath168 clearly respects .",
    "interpreting @xmath169 as a boltzmann factor , we find an explicit hamiltonian @xmath170(with @xmath171 ) .",
    "note that this ising hamiltonian depends on the row- and column sums of @xmath78 .",
    "thus , each ` spin ' is coupled to all other ` spins ' _ in its row and column _ , via all types of ` multi - spin ' interactions .",
    "though the appearance of long range interactions may suggest challenging analyses , we recall that , if an ising hamiltonian is only a function of the sum over all spins , the standard mean - field approximation becomes exact in the large-@xmath10 limit .",
    "the case here is more complicated , as there are @xmath172 different sums , but we may expect a similar simplification in the large-@xmath10 limit . this expectation is realised , as we will see in the next section .    from here , we can follow standard techniques of equilibrium statistical mechanics to find averages ( @xmath173 ) of various observables , e.g. , @xmath155 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 , etc .",
    "in particular , we need to compute @xmath176 to find our equation of state , @xmath177",
    ". of course , such tasks are highly non - trivial , even when @xmath37 is explicitly given .",

    "this disadvantage can be remedied by introducing a continuous , fugacity - like variable @xmath242 .",

    "note that @xmath242 does not add new physics to the @xmath6 model , in the sense that the essence of our system s behavior can be studied by varying just the numbers of each subgroup . by extending parameter space to @xmath247",
    ", we will find that , in the @xmath248 limit , @xmath249becomes the key control variable , with @xmath250 being the critical point .",
    "we observe that the lowest value of energy scales as @xmath251 for @xmath252 with @xmath253 fixed .",
    "this is stronger than the quadratic dependence on the number of agents !",
    "such non - linear increase of ` energy ' with system size reflects the fact that , in the stationary state , some configurations may occur with very low probability .",
    "examples of this behavior in previously studied models include the so - called abc modelevans and the oslo rice - pile model @xcite .",
    "this non - extensivity of the ` energy ' causes no real problems in our model , as all ensemble averages are well - behaved in the large @xmath10 limit . since the number of configurations only increases as @xmath254 , the ` entropy term ' in the effective free energy scales as @xmath255 .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath10 limit , the behavior of the system is dominated by the energy term .",
    "since the empty or the complete ( bipartite ) graph has the lowest energy ( depending on @xmath69 ) , we have a good intuitive picture for the emergence of the extreme thouless effect , namely , the fraction @xmath256 jumping from @xmath60 to @xmath8 as @xmath69 crosses unity .",
    "this observation also naturally lead to consider variational and perturbative approaches .    even for non - extensive systems , the variational principle of minimizing free energy allows us to find the best choice of parameters in a trial probability measure for approximating the true @xmath37 .",

    "we show in fig [ minmax10 ^ 5 ] the configuration at the last time ( top central panel ) along with its sorted version ( top right panel ) .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to show that , if we resort the agents after each update , it is not possible for an introvert to create a @xmath60 ( cut a link ) in the sea of @xmath8s , or for an extrovert to create a @xmath8 in the domain of @xmath60s .",
    "thus , the staircase like interface between the two domains will be preserved at each step and our @xmath67 can be mapped into a 1-dimensional interface , starting at the top left corner of the square and ending at the lower right .",
    "the configurations are readily labeled by a string of @xmath378 vertical and @xmath378 horizontal steps , e.g. , @xmath518 . with this mapping , we see that the rules of evolution are simple : choose a step ( an element of the string ) at random and exchange the first unlike pair to its right .",
    "for example , if the third @xmath519 is chosen , the new string is @xmath520 .",
    "we see that the unlike pairs are exchanged with varying rates that depend on the length of the domain to the left .",
    "this mapping also reduces the number of configurations considerably , from @xmath521 for all possible @xmath78s to just @xmath522 .    turning to non - critical cases , we see that the relevant strings consist of @xmath310 @xmath519s and @xmath241 @xmath523s , so that we have a total of @xmath524 configurations . as a result of the dynamics",
