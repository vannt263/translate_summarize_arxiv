    "the spins in fermi gases display a rich range of behaviors : both collisionless and collision dominated spin waves have been studied in a number of recent experiments @xcite . here",
    "we present a simple model of the collisionless regime , and study the dynamics .",
    "collisionless spin waves were first explored in @xmath0he film , then in spin polarized hydrogen @xcite .",
    "however , some of these early works are hard to observe in these atomic systems . unlike these early studies , cold atom experiments allow one to directly image the spin waves @xcite . such images complement the spectroscopic and transport probes used to understand @xmath0he and hydrogen .    while our focus is the weakly interacting regime , much recent work has explored the collision dominated strongly interacting limit .",
    "one of the problems is to understand the spin diffusive behavior in this regime .",
    "for example , it is conjectured that quantum mechanics forbids the spin diffusion constant from exceeding @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the reduced planck s constant and @xmath3 is the atomic mass .",
    "this bound appears to be consistent with the recent theoretical and experiment results@xcite .",
    "our model is largely inspired by the experiments of bardon _",
    "et al_. in toronto @xcite .",
    "there a two - component fermi gas is placed in a cigar shape trap .",
    "the gas is prepared with a uniform magnetization in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "a magnetic field is applied in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the strength of this field varies linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "the experimentalists let the system evolve for some time then interrogate it , typically with a spin - echo protocol @xcite . for simplicity , we do not model the spin - echo , but simply study how the magnetization evolves .",
    "since all dynamics are one - dimensional ( 1d ) , and the hamiltonian can be integrated out in the other two dimensions , we will focus on the 1d model instead .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we consider the non - interacting case , where we can analytically describe the dynamics .",
    "we show that the transverse magnetization oscillates , and explain this behavior in terms of transverse and longitudinal spin rotations",
    ". then we study weak interaction .",
    "we find beats which can be attributed to the exchange interaction . in the end",
    ", we discuss the transition from collisionless to the collisional limit and give our summary .",
    "we consider 1d pseudospin-1/2 fermi gases in a magnetic field gradient along the @xmath7 axis . in the absence of interactions , we can consider the dimensionless single - particle hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 for the up and down spin states , with respect to the @xmath5 axis . here",
    "@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the position of the particle and @xmath12 is the characteristic length of the harmonic oscillator , with @xmath13 the trap frequency .",
    "the magnetic field gradient is represented by dimensionless @xmath14 .",
    "the actual magnetic gradient is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnetic moment .",
    "the dimensionless time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the real time .",
    "hereafter we will use these dimensionless quantities .",
    "the many - body state will consist of a slater determinant of single - particle states @xmath19 , each of which evolve via the time - dependent schrodinger equation , @xmath20 .",
    "the index @xmath21 runs from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , where @xmath23 is the number of particles .",
    "we envision preparing the system so that at time @xmath24 the @xmath21th state of the slater determinant has spin components @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath21th eigenstate of the simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "such an initial condition is prepared by first polarizing the system in the @xmath28 state , and cooling it to the ground state .",
    "one then applies a @xmath29 pulse , rotating the spin from the @xmath5 direction to the @xmath4 direction .",
    "to find the subsequent dynamics , we make the following ansatz : @xmath30 this ansatz describes the exact dynamics in the absence of interactions .",
    "substituting this ansatz into the schrodinger equation yields a set of ordinary differential equations for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 these equations are readily integrated to yield @xmath35 the local magnetization in the @xmath36 plane can be expressed as a complex number @xmath37 .",
    "this complex magnetization can be written as @xmath38 with @xmath39    we give the physical picture leading to magnetization dynamics in this non - interacting case in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) , the center of the up - spin and down - spin clouds become separated by a distance @xmath40 .",
    "this reduces the overlap between the clouds , and the magnitude of the local transverse magnetization . as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , the clouds also develop a relative phase profile @xmath41 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , this phase factor can be interpreted as a spin precession term .",
    "while it does not change the magnitude of the local polarization , it makes the direction depend on position .",
    "thus it does reduce the total transverse magnetization @xmath42 . by symmetry",
    "@xmath43 is always real , implying the net transverse polarization is always in the @xmath4 direction . by construction @xmath44",
    "is dimensionless .",
    "+    figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the evolution of the transverse magnetization for @xmath45 particles , taking @xmath46 . as expected from eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) , we see clear undamped oscillations .",
    "we also show the contribution from the @xmath47 and @xmath48 states .",

    "also shown is the average magnetization of the particles for the two lowest states : @xmath47 ( dotted ) and @xmath48 ( dashed).,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in this section , we consider the influence of weak interaction on the system .",
    "we make a time - dependent hartree - fock ansatz , assuming that at all times the system is described by a slater determinant of @xmath23 single - particle states .",
    "the equations of motion can be derived by minimizing the action @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents the many - body wave function .",
    "the action can be decomposed as a sum of a non - interacting and an interacting part @xmath52 . within",
    "the hartree - fock ansatz , @xmath53 with @xmath54 represents the reduced interaction strength with @xmath55 the physical one . minimizing the action with respect to the wave functions @xmath56 yields equations of motion @xmath57 as argued in @xcite , in the limit of slow spatial and temporal dynamics , these coupled equations are equivalent to the collisionless boltzmann equation . for moderate @xmath23",
    ", we can numerically integrate these equations .",
    "the exchange interaction acts like a spatially inhomogeneous transverse magnetic field , and scrambles the spins .",
    "the simple oscillations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] develop more structure , exhibiting quantum beats as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "these beats can be qualitatively understood by considering a single wave function @xmath58 in the slater determinant , and treating the other wavefunctions as a static homogeneous background . within this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) becomes a similar jaynes - cummings model , @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 the effective exchange interaction strength .",
    "the subsequent mathematics is simpler if we rotate spin space by @xmath62 .",

    "dashed lines show the eigen - energies when the field gradient @xmath14 and effective exchange field @xmath61 are both zero .",
    "the exchange field splits the degeneracy between @xmath70 and @xmath71 states , yielding the solid lines . @xmath72 .",
    "the gradient @xmath14 couples levels as shown by the arrows . at time @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 , corresponding to the state marked with a circle.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    this hamiltonian can be understood from the level diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . for zero interaction and magnetic field",
    "gradient , the system is a simply harmonic oscillator and has energy levels at @xmath72 , which is the dashed lines in fig . [",
    "fig : fig3 ] . the exchange coupling @xmath61 shifts the eigenstate energy of @xmath70 and @xmath71 spins , shown as the solid lines and energy @xmath75 .",
    "the magnetic field gradient flips the spins and at the same time changes the vibrational level by one . for small @xmath14",
    ", one can truncate the time dynamics to a three level system : the initial state , labeled by a circle , and the two states which are coupled to it .",
    "this yields two oscillation frequencies @xmath76 , and to second order in @xmath14 the contribution to the magnetization from the @xmath21th term in the slater determinant is @xmath77 .",
    "the beats in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] are qualitatively consistent with this scenario , but this simplified model is not able to quantitatively describe the evolution of the magnetization .",
    "a more sophisticated , and quantitatively accurate , ansatz involves taking the @xmath21th wavefunction in the slater determinant as having the form @xmath78 minimizing the action with this ansatz yields equations of motion for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 \\left(\\begin{array}{c } a_n\\\\b_n\\\\c_n \\end{array}\\right)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 .",
    "the nonlinear term is    @xmath83    where @xmath84 the above equations can be solved iteratively and we get the net magnetization @xmath85    we plot the magnetization for system @xmath45 and @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the reduced interaction is chosen as @xmath86 .",
    "we can see the weak interaction develops beats in the magnetization , which is expected from our previous approximation .",
    "these differential equations are much easier to integrate than the hartree - fock equations , and as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , this simple ansatz captures most of the relevant physics .    .",
    "the particle number and magnetic gradient is the same as the non - interacting case and @xmath17 is the reduced time with @xmath18 the real time and @xmath13 the trap frequency . solid black line : simplified variational approximation .",
    "dashed orange line : full hartree - fock calculation.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    finally , we give the condition when the actual three - dimensional ( 3d ) experiment goes from collisionless to collisional limit .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this transition is determined by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the two - body elastic scattering rate per particle with @xmath21 the mean density of the system , @xmath89 the scattering cross section , and @xmath32 the relative velocity .",
    "if the scattering event seldom happens at several oscillation periods , i.e. , @xmath90 , the dynamics is mainly dominated by collisionless processes .",
    "the system shows spin wave dynamics in this regime . increasing the scattering rate @xmath91",
    ", it continuously goes from collisionless limit to collisional limit . in our system @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "our 1d reduced interaction strength is connected to the 3d scattering length as @xmath95 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath96 is the transverse width and for a isotropic harmonic potential we have @xmath97 .",
    "thus we have @xmath98 .",
    "so for a strongly interacting collisional limit , one has to fulfill @xmath99 for reduced magnetic gradient @xmath46 . beyond this point ,",
    "the system is dominated by collisional processes and the physics of spin diffusion begin to take part .",
    "in summary , we give an analysis of the collisionless spin dynamics of a weakly interacting fermi gas in a magnetic field gradient . in the absence of interactions",
    "the net transverse magnetization oscillates with the trap frequency .",
    "weak interactions lead to beats .",
    "we present simple models which explain these dynamics .    for a related experiment ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics can be directly observed using the techniques in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the beats behavior clearly tells the low energy spin wave dynamics of the system . here",
    "even though our calculation is purely 1d , we believe the beats behavior is also preserved in the 3d system .",
    "this can also be seen from our mean - field argument , where the other dimensions will only change the eigenenergy of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "however the other two dimensions do contribute to the system .",
    "they will influence the local interaction strength and then shift the beats .",
    "also in the experiment one needs to take into account the effect of temperature . for a non - zero temperature",
    ", the atoms will spread to higher single - particle states and the spin dynamics will be enhanced .",
