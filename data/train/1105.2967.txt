    "the study of kaon photoproduction is motivated by the possibility of a model - independent amplitude reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "this type of analysis has been realized for nucleon - nucleon scattering  @xcite and may soon be attempted for kaon photoproduction , given the existing and expected data for single- and double - polarization quantities .",
    "a second motivation hinges on the possibility that a resonance analysis will reveal states not clearly seen in processes containing initial or final single - pion states .",
    "several recent  @xcite and older  @xcite studies have noted that these two goals ( amplitude reconstruction and multipole analysis ) are very different in nature . in the following ,",
    "we have applied the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite to the low - energy kaon photoproduction database in order to do a multipole analysis .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the low - energy pion photoproduction database was analyzed using a two - step procedure .",
    "charged - pion photoproduction data were fitted assuming a known t - channel pion exchange mechanism for the high ( unfitted ) multipoles .",
    "this effectively removed the overall phase ambiguity that arises when only a finite number of multipoles are fitted , and the higher waves are neglected .",
    "the obtained charged - pion multipoles , and an appliction of watson s theorem  @xcite for multipoles coupled to the elastic @xmath0 @xmath1 partial wave , allowed for the determination of neutral - pion production multipoles . in a similar approach ,",
    "not using watson s theorem directly , grushin  @xcite was able to extract the @xmath1 phases from a fit to photoproduction data .    as charged - kaon photoproduction has a t - channel process contributing to high partial waves , the method used in ref .",
    "@xcite was applied over a region where @xmath2 and @xmath3wave multipoles were expected to dominate .",
    "we have focused on energies from threshold to 1.8 gev in center - of - mass energy ( @xmath4 ) , as this covers a region influenced by the n(1650)@xmath5 , n(1710)@xmath6 , and n(1720)@xmath7 resonances , included in the kaon maid fit , but is below the proposed n(1900)@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the t - channel process in kaon photoproduction is generally  @xcite built up from the exchange of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the latter two states have sizeable widths producing complex multipoles .",
    "the contribution to the total cross section from born plus @xmath12 exchange diagrams is known to increase rapidly at moderate energies and this feature is usually handled with the introduction of form factors  @xcite . as a result , the prediction of higher multipoles is more model - dependent here than in the case of charged - pion photoproduction .",
    "we should also note that a recent single - energy multipole analysis has found broad bands of multipole solutions , which are experimentally indistinguishable , using the existing database  @xcite .",
    "our findings are slightly more optomistic , showing at least qualitative agreement with some previous phenomenological fits .",
    "problems noted in ref .",
    "@xcite have been found here as well .",
    "data were fitted at single energies corresponding to the low - energy measurements of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 from the graal collaboration  @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections were taken from the clas collaboration  @xcite . the lowest energy point from ref .",
    "@xcite was omitted , as contradictory differential cross section measurements exist just above and below this energy .",
    "conventions for the signs of polarized measurements were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , differing from those adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fitting the data , multipoles up to @xmath18 and @xmath19 were varied .",
    "waves beyond those being fitted were taken from the born plus @xmath12 exchange diagrams used in the kaon maid fit  @xcite . in practice , however , over the considered energy range , the @xmath18 and @xmath19 multipoles were found to be compatible with the born contribution , apart from contributions to the real parts of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the resulting values for chi - squared per degree of freedom were between 0.5 and unity for all searches .    in fig .  1 we show the quality of our fit to the cross section , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 data , corresponding to lab photon energy of 1027 mev ( @xmath20=1675 mev )",
    "figure 2 shows the fit to @xmath16 data and a prediction of @xmath17 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "fitting @xmath17 and predicting the remaining observables gives a comparable result .",
    "the results in fig .  3 , for beam - target quantities e , f , g and h , are predictions .",
    "preliminary clas data for e  @xcite show agreement with this behavior , but rather poor agreement with other previous analyses .",
    "the level of agreement , only slightly worse than a fit of all observables , provides a validation of the method .",
    "however , the problem of uniqueness for extracted multipoles , found in ref .",
    "@xcite , still persists .",
    "in fig .  3 , a set of single - energy multipoles is compared to the kaon maid solution .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good , particularly for the imaginary parts , which appear qualitatively consistent with the n(1650 ) and n(1710 ) resonances contained in kaon maid .",
    "the behavior of @xmath23 is also evidence for a contribution from the n(1720 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath24 multipole has a large real part not included in kaon maid . a feature quite similar to this",
    "is seen in the energy - dependent multipole analysis of mart  @xcite . a large near - threshold value , with a different sign , is also found in the bonn - gatchina analysis  @xcite .    in fig .  3",
    ", the multipoles at a particular energy were obtained through searches in parameter space near adjacent - energy solutions . however , in expanding the parameter space , we found indistinguishable solutions , with very low chi - squared , corresponding to different multipole sets .",
    "results for the @xmath23 and @xmath25 were not stable .",
    "however , the trend seen in the @xmath26 and @xmath24 multipoles remains in these alternate solutions .",
    "similar difficulties were also found in the multipole analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the dominant multipoles fitted up to 1.9 gev .",
    "the fit remains quite good , retaining a chi - squared per degree of freedom less than unity , without requiring a search of higher multipoles .",
    "the real part of the @xmath24 multipole shows a rapid drop to zero , associated with a rise in the imaginary part , at approximately 1.9 gev .",
    "this supports the claim for a 2-star n(1900 ) contribution  @xcite .",
    "we have performed an exploratory single - energy multipole analysis of kaon photoproduction data near threshold - a region where we assumed only a few multipoles would deviate from born predictions .",
    "the results are mixed .",
    "we have been able to fit a minimal set of data , predicting other observables , thus testing the method .",
    "however , a unique set of multipoles was not found .",
    "this confirms the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite with a somewhat different method .",
    "clearly , the validity of this method rests on the model - independence of the t - channel process",
    ". it would be useful to repeat these fits with a set of different models for this contribution .",
    "many recipies exist to moderate the born contributions .",
    "their effect is likely to add another source of model - dependence with increased energy .",
    "the fact that our search tended to require corrections to the real parts of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 multipoles suggests that a modified t - channel contribution may be required .",
    "this issue is presently being studied .",
    "numerical values for the single - energy solutions and included datasets will be provided through the said webpage  @xcite .",
    "plots of the extracted multipoles show qualitative similarities to the kaon maid fit in some cases near threshold . for the @xmath24 ,",
    "however , the result is qualitatively different near threshold , with resonance - like behavior near the n(1900 ) resonance energy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , multiple solutions were also found in fits to a larger set of observables , with a low chi - squared .",
    "multipoles up to l=3 were searched , whereas we have taken waves with l@xmath271 to be given by the born contribution , including @xmath12 exchange , with corrections to the real parts of @xmath18 and @xmath19 contributions found necessary in the fit . fitting higher multipoles decreases the chi - squared but also reduces the born contributions , which serve to remove the overall phase ambiguity . we have also found that including the @xmath18 and @xmath19 multipoles in the fit , when not required , tended to increase the uncertainties on the other fit parameters .",
    "multipole analyses come in two main types : those with a significant t - channel component , which is taken as known to remove the overall sign ambiguity ( such as @xmath28 photoproduction ) , and others with a negligible t - channel contribution ( such as @xmath29 photoproduction at low energies ) . in the latter case ,",
    "one is free to fix one multipole phase and determine multipoles only up to this unknown phase ( which is a function of energy ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , born terms were added and a phase for the @xmath26 multipole was chosen .",
    "this was not done in the present fit . here",
    "the born contribution has fixed our overall phase and therefore the phase of @xmath26 as well .",
