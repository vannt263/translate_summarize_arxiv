    "the motivation for supersymmetry at an accessible energy is provided by the gauge hierarchy problem  @xcite , namely that of understanding why @xmath4 , the only candidate for a fundamental mass scale in physics . alternatively and equivalently",
    ", one may ask why @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the planck mass , expected to be the fundamental gravitational mass scale . or",
    "one may ask why the coulomb potential inside an atom is so much larger than the newton potential , which is equivalent to why @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the proton and electron masses .",
    "one might think it would be sufficient to choose the bare mass parameters : @xmath9 .",
    "however , one must then contend with quantum corrections , which are quadratically divergent : m^2_h , w = o  ( )  ^2 [ twentysix ] which is much larger than @xmath10 , if the cutoff @xmath11 representing the appearance of new physics is taken to be @xmath12 .",
    "this means that one must fine - tune the bare mass parameter so that it is almost exactly cancelled by the quantum correction ( [ twentysix ] ) in order to obtain a small physical value of @xmath10 .",
    "this seems unnatural , and the alternative is to introduce new physics at the tev scale , so that the correction ( [ twentysix ] ) is naturally small .    at one stage , it was proposed that this new physics might correspond to the higgs boson being composite  @xcite . however , calculable scenarios of this type are inconsistent with the precision electroweak data from lep and elsewhere .",
    "the alternative is to postulate approximate supersymmetry  @xcite , whose pairs of bosons and fermions produce naturally cancelling quantum corrections : m^2_w = o  ( )  m^2_b - m^2_f [ twentyseven ] that are naturally small : @xmath13 if m^2_b - m^2_f^2 .",
    "[ twentysevenhalf ] there are many other possible motivations for supersymmetry , but this is the only one that gives reason to expect that it might be accessible to the current generation of accelerators and in the range expected for a cold dark matter particle .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) has the same gauge interactions as the standard model , and the yukawa interactions are very similar : _",
    "d qd^ch + _ le^ch + _ u qu^c|h + |hh [ twentyeight ] where the capital letters denote supermultiplets with the same quantum numbers as the left - handed fermions of the standard model . the couplings @xmath14 give masses to down quarks , leptons and up quarks respectively , via distinct higgs fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are required in order to cancel triangle anomalies .",
    "the new parameter in ( [ twentyeight ] ) is the bilinear coupling @xmath17 between these higgs fields , that plays a significant rle in the description of the lightest supersymmetric particle , as we see below .",
    "the gauge quantum numbers do not forbid the appearance of additional couplings lle^c + ^lqd^c + u^cd^cd^c [ twentynine ] but these violate lepton or baryon number , and we assume they are absent .",
    "one significant aspect of the mssm is that the quartic scalar interactions are determined , leading to important constraints on the higgs mass , as we also see below .",
    "supersymmetry must be broken , since supersymmetric partner particles do not have identical masses , and this is usually parametrized by scalar mass parameters @xmath18 , gaugino masses @xmath19 and trilinear scalar couplings @xmath20 .",
    "these are commonly supposed to be inputs from some high - energy physics such as supergravity or string theory .",
    "it is often hypothesized that these inputs are universal : @xmath21 , but these assumptions are not strongly motivated by any fundamental theory .",
    "the physical sparticle mass parameters are then renormalized in a calculable way : m^2_0_i = m^2_0 + c_i m^2_1/2  ,   m_a = ( _ a _ gut )  m_1/2 [ thirty ] where the @xmath22 are calculable coefficients  @xcite and mssm phenomenology is then parametrized by @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( the ratio of higgs v.e.v.s ) .",
    "precision electroweak data from lep and elsewhere provide two qualitative indications in favour of supersymmetry .",
    "one is that the inferred magnitude of quantum corrections favour a relatively light higgs boson  @xcite m_h = 66^+74_-39 10  gev [ thirtyone ] which is highly consistent with the value predicted in the mssm : @xmath25 150 gev  @xcite as a result of the constrained quartic couplings .",
    "( on the other hand , composite higgs models predicted an effective higgs mass @xmath26 1 tev and other unseen quantum corrections . ) the other indication in favour of low - energy supersymmetry is provided by measurements of the gauge couplings at lep , that correspond to @xmath27 in agreement with the predictions of supersymmetric guts with sparticles weighing about 1  tev , but in disagreement with non - supersymmetric guts that predict @xmath28 to 0.22  @xcite .",
    "neither of these arguments provides an accurate estimate of the sparticle mass scales , however , since they are both only logarithmically sensitive to @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is expected to be stable in the mssm , and hence should be present in the universe today as a cosmological relic from the big bang  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of a multiplicatively - conserved quantum number called @xmath31 parity , which is related to baryon number , lepton number and spin : r = ( -1)^3b+l+2s [ thirtytwo ] it is easy to check that @xmath32 for all standard model particles and @xmath33 for all their supersymmetric partners . the interactions ( [ twentynine ] ) would violate @xmath31 , but not a majorana neutrino mass term or the other interactions in @xmath34 or @xmath35 guts .",
    "there are three important consequences of @xmath31 conservation : ( i ) sparticles are always produced in pairs , e.g. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , ( ii ) heavier sparticles decay into lighter sparticles , e.g. , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and ( iii ) the lsp is stable because it has no legal decay mode .",
    "if such a supersymmetric relic particle had either electric charge or strong interactions , it would have condensed along with ordinary baryonic matter during the formation of astrophysical structures , and should be present in the universe today in anomalous heavy isotopes .",
    "these have not been seen in studies of @xmath15 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 isotopes at levels ranging from @xmath48 to @xmath49  @xcite , which are far below the calculated relic abundances from the big bang : 10 ^ -6 10 ^ -10 [ thirtythree ] for relics with electromagnetic or strong interactions . except possibly for very heavy relics , one would expect these primordial relic particles to condense into galaxies , stars and planets , along with ordinary bayonic material , and hence show up as an anaomalous heavy isotope of one or more of the elements studied .",
    "there would also be a ` cosmic rain ' of such relics  @xcite , but this would presumably not be the dominant source of such particles on earth .",
    "the conflict with ( [ thirtythree ] ) is sufficiently acute that the lightest supersymmetric relic must presumably be electromagnetically neutral and weakly interacting  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "i believe that the possibility of a stable gluino can be excluded .",
    "this leaves as scandidates for cold dark matter a sneutrino @xmath50 with spin 0 , some neutralino mixture of @xmath51 with spin 1/2 , and the gravitino @xmath52 with spin 3/2 .",
    "lep searches for invisible @xmath53 decays require @xmath54  @xcite , and searches for the interactions of relic particles with nuclei then enforce @xmath55 few tev  @xcite , so we exclude this possibility for the lsp .",
    "the possibility of a gravitino @xmath52 lsp has attracted renewed interest recently with the revival of gauge - mediated models of supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , and could constitute warm dark matter if @xmath56 . in this talk , however , i concentrate on the @xmath57 neutralino combination @xmath0 , which is the best supersymmetric candidate for cold dark matter",
    ".    the neutralinos and charginos may be characterized at the tree level by three parameters : @xmath30 , @xmath17 and tan@xmath58 .",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath0 simplifies in the limit @xmath59 where it becomes essentially a pure photino @xmath60 , or @xmath61 where it becomes essentially a pure higgsino @xmath62 .",
    "these possibilities are excluded , however , by lep and the fnal tevatron collider  @xcite . from the point of view of astrophysics and cosmology ,",
    "it is encouraging that there are generic domains of the remaining parameter space where @xmath63 to @xmath64 , in particular in regions where @xmath0 is approximately a @xmath65 gaugino @xmath66 , as seen in fig",
    ". 1  @xcite .",
    "purely experimental searches at lep enforce @xmath67 gev , as seen in fig .",
    "2  @xcite .",
    "this bound can be strengthened by making various theoretical assumptions , such as the universality of scalar masses @xmath68 , including in the higgs sector , the cosmological dark matter requirement that @xmath69 and the astrophysical preference that @xmath70 .",
    "taken together as in fig .",
    "3 , we see that they enforce m _ 42 [ thirtyfour ] and lep should eventually be able to establish or exclude @xmath71 up to about 50 gev . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , lep has already explored almost all the parameter space available for a higgsino - like lsp , and this possibility will also be thoroughly explored by lep  @xcite .",
    "should one be concerned that no sparticles have yet been seen by either lep or the fnal tevatron collider ?",
    "one way to quantify this is via the amount of fine - tuning of the input parameters required to obtain the physical value of @xmath10  @xcite : _ o = max_i [ thirtyfive ] where @xmath72 is a generic supergravity input parameter . as seen in fig . 5 ,",
    "the lep exclusions impose  @xcite _ o 8 [ thirtysix ] although fine - tuning is a matter of taste , this is perhaps not large enough to be alarming , and could in any case be reduced significantly if a suitable theoretical relation between some input parameters is postulated  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the amount of fine - tuning @xmath73 is minimized when @xmath74 as preferred astrophysically , as seen in fig . 6  @xcite .",
    "this means that solving the gauge hierarchy problem naturally leads to a relic neutralino density in the range of interest to astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "i am unaware of any analogous argument for the neutrino or the axion .",
    "for certain ranges of the mssm parameters , our present electroweak vacuum is unstable against the development of vev s for @xmath75 and @xmath76 fields , leading to vacua that would break charge and colour conservation . among the dangerous possibilities are flat directions of the effective potential in which combinations such as @xmath77 acquire vev s .",
    "avoiding these vacua imposes constraints that depend on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters : they are weakest for @xmath78 .",
    "figure 7 illustrates some of the resulting constraints in the @xmath79 plane , for different values of @xmath24 and signs of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we see that they cut out large parts of the plane , particularly for low @xmath29 . in combination with cosmology",
    ", they tend to rule out large values of @xmath30 , but this aspect needs to be considered in conjunction with the effects of co - annihilation , that are discussed in the next section .",
    "as @xmath71 increases , the lsp annihilation cross - section decreases and hence its relic number and mass density increase .",
    "how heavy could the lsp be ?",
    "until recently , the limit given was @xmath80 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , it has now been pointed out that there are regions of the mssm parameter space where co - annihilations of the @xmath0 with the stau slepton @xmath81 could be important , as seen in fig.8  @xcite .",
    "these co - annihilations would suppress @xmath82 , allowing a heavier neutralino mass , and we now find that  @xcite m _ 600 [ thirtyseven ] is possible if we require @xmath83 . in the past , it was thought that all the cosmologically - preferred region of mssm parameter space could be explored by the lhc  @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "9 , but it now seems possible that there may be a delicate region close to the upper bound ( [ thirtyseven ] ) .",
    "this point requires further study .",
    "the lep constraints on mssm particles have recently been updated @xcite , constraining the parameter space and hence the lsp .",
    "the large luminosity accumulated during 1998 has enabled the lower limit on the chargino mass to be increased essentially to the beam energy : @xmath84 95 gev , except in the deep higgsino region , where the limit decreases to about 90 gev because of the small mass difference between the chargino and the lsp , which reduces the efficiency for detecting the @xmath85 decay products .",
    "there are also useful limits on associated neutralino production @xmath86 , which further constrain the lsp . without further theoretical assumptions ,",
    "the purely experimental lower limit on the neutralino mass has become m_32  gev [ one ] for large values of @xmath29 whatever the value of @xmath24 , decreasing to a minimum of 28 gev for small @xmath29 .",
    "there are other new lep limits that come into play with supplementary theoretical assumptions .",
    "these include a lower limit on the slepton mass , assuming universality @xmath87 : m_l > 90  gev [ two ] for @xmath88 5 gev .",
    "there is also a new lower limit m_t > 85  gev [ three ] assuming the dominance of @xmath89 decay , for @xmath90 10 gev .",
    "most important , however , is the new lower limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the mssm .",
    "the l3 collaboration reports m_h > 95.5  gev [ four ] for @xmath91 . combining all four lep experiments , the lower limit ( 17 )",
    "would probably be increased to 98 gev , corresponding to the kinematic limit @xmath92 (= 189 gev ) - @xmath93 .",
    "the mssm higgs and other limits now appear to effectively exclude the possibility of higgsino dark matter .",
    "moreover , for @xmath94 , we now find @xmath3 3.0 , whereas a slightly smaller value is allowable if @xmath95 . for values of @xmath24 close to these lower limits ,",
    "the lower limit on @xmath96 increases sharply , qualitatively as in fig .",
    "6 but now shifted to the right .",
    "the valley in fig .",
    "6a for @xmath94 is now filled in , so , pending a more complete evaluation , we estimate that m_50  gev [ five ] for either sign of @xmath17 .",
    "we have seen that current experimental constraints impose @xmath97 50 gev if universal soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters are assumed , and that @xmath98 600 gev if we require @xmath83 .",
    "values of @xmath96 close to the lower limit may be explored by forthcoming runs of lep in 1999 and 2000 : the searches for the higgs boson will be particularly interesting to follow .",
    "thereafter , run ii of the tevatron collider has the best accelerator chances to find supersymmetry , until the lhc comes along .    in the mean time",
    ", non - accelerator searches looking directly for lsp - nucleus scattering or indirectly at lsp annihilation products will be offering stiff competition .",
    "there is already one direct search that does not claim not to have observed lsp - nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "the possible signal would correspond to a domain of msssm parameter space close to the present limits .",
    "the lsp interpretation of the signal is not yet generally accepted , since a complete annual modulation cycle has not yet been reported .",
    "however , healthy scepticism should not obscure the fact that it is consistent with the limits on sparticle dark matter reported here .",
    "time only will tell whether accelerator or non - accelerator experiments will win the race to discover supersymmetry .",
