    "milgrom ( 1983 ) proposed that the failure of galactic rotation curves to decline in keplerian fashion outside the galaxies luminous body arises not because galaxies are embedded in massive dark halos , but because newton s law of gravity has to be modified for fields that generate accelerations smaller than some characteristic value @xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , in order to solve basic problems presented by this phenomenological formulation of the theory ( now known as modified newtonian dynamics or mond ) , such as conservation of linear momentum ( felten 1984 ) , bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) substituted the heuristic 1983 model with the mond non - relativistic field equation @xmath1 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the standard euclidean norm , @xmath3 is the gravitational potential produced by the density distribution @xmath4 , and @xmath5 for @xmath6 . as stressed by bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 )",
    ", the equation above is obtained from a variational principle applied to a lagrangian with all the required symmetries , so the standard conservation laws are obeyed .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) plays in mond the same role as the poisson equation @xmath7 in newtonian gravity , and the mond gravitational field @xmath8 experienced by a _ test _",
    "particle is @xmath9    as well known , in the regime of intermediate accelerations the function @xmath10 is not fully constrained by theory or observations , while in the asymptotic regimes @xmath11 throughout the paper we conform to the standard assumption @xmath12 ( see however famaey & binney 2005 ) .    from equation  ( [ eqmuasym ] )",
    "it follows that equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) reduces to the poisson equation when @xmath13 , while the limit equation @xmath14 obtained by assuming @xmath15 in equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) , describes systems for which ( or regions of space where ) @xmath16 , i.e. systems for which the mond predictions differ most from the newtonian ones . as a consequence equation  ( [ eqdmond ] ) , characterizing the so - called ` deep mond regime ' ( hereafter dmond ) , is of particular relevance in mond investigations .    nowadays",
    "a considerable body of observational data seems to support mond well beyond its originally intended field of application ( see , e.g. , milgrom  2002 ; sanders & mcgaugh  2002 ) , making this theory an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm .",
    "it is thus natural to study in detail mond predictions , in particular focusing on dmond systems , i.e. systems that should be dark matter dominated if newtonian gravity holds . potential problems of the theory have already been pointed out by various authors ( see , e.g. the & white 1988 ; buote et al .",

    "2005 ) , but further analyses are needed to reach firmer conclusions . unfortunately , mond investigations have been considerably slowed down by the lack of aspherical density - potential pairs to test theory predictions in cases more realistic than those described by spherical symmetry : the search for a sufficiently general method to construct aspherical mond solutions is the subject of this paper",
    ".    in mond , the main difficulty to obtain exact aspherical density - potential pairs ( or to build robust numerical solvers ) originates from the non - linear nature of the theory , which makes impossible a straightforward use of the analytical and numerical techniques available for the poisson equation ( such as integral transforms or expansion in orthogonal functions ) . in addition",
    ", a simple relation between the newtonian and the mond gravity fields in general does not exist .",
    "although equation  ( [ eqpoisson ] ) can be used to lower the order of equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) by eliminating the source density , it follows that @xmath17 and @xmath18 differ by some unknown solenoidal field in general can not be arbitrarily set to zero is due to the fact that the mond acceleration field must be derived from a potential , while equation  ( [ eqmug ] ) , if correct in general , would imply that @xmath19 , an identity which is not necessarily true when @xmath8 is derived from a potential . ]",
    "@xmath20 . remarkably , brada & milgrom ( 1995 ; hereafter bm95 ) showed that when the modulus @xmath21 of the newtonian gravitational field produced by @xmath4 is a function of @xmath22 only , @xmath23 vanishes , and so the mond acceleration @xmath8 is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqmug ] ) coincides with the original mond formulation of milgrom ( 1983 ) and can be solved algebraically : particularly simple cases described by this equations are those in which the density distribution is spherically or cylindrically symmetric , or stratified on homogeneous planes . in such cases",
    "the mond potential is not more difficult to construct than the corresponding newtonian potential .",
    "this is the reason why _ all _ the ( astrophysically relevant ) analytical mond density - potential pairs known are spherically symmetric : in fact , the only exact , aspherical mond density - potential pair available is the axisymmetric razor - thin kuzmin disk ( and the derived family ; bm95 ) , for which @xmath27 . in all the other cases one",
    "is forced to solve numerically equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) .",
    "the importance of a general method to obtain the explicit mond potential of density distributions with prescribed shape and stratification is then obvious , because it would allow for orbit integration , without resorting to numerical integration of equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) ; in addition , analytical solutions could be used to test numerical mond solvers in more realistic cases than spherical symmetry . in this paper",
    "we show that such an approach can be devised .",
    "in particular , we show how a `` seed '' spherical density distribution can be deformed in an axisymmetric or triaxial density distribution with analytical potential satisfying the mond equation , by means of a pair of very simple existence theorems and ( for example ) by using building blocks obtained from the ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ; hereafter cb05 ) method .",
    "in addition , as a complement to the analytical method , we also illustrate a new numerical mond solver based on spectral methods , which adds to the short list of the others available ( milgrom 1986 ; bm95 ; see also brada & milgrom  1999 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the general method ( postponing to the appendix the proof of three technical results on which the method is based ) , and in section  3 we construct families of triaxial profiles obtained by deformation of the hernquist ( 1990 ) sphere .",
    "the original numerical code developed to compute the mond potential of generic density distributions is then described in section  4 , where we also show how well it recovers the analytical triaxial potentials of section  3 and the mond kuzmin density - potential pair .",
    "the code is finally used to investigate the field @xmath23 of highly flattened triaxial density distributions .",
    "the main results of the paper and possible future applications are finally summarized in section  5 .",
    "two different approaches are possible to construct explicit solutions of equation ( [ eqmond ] ) : in the most obvious one attempts to recover the potential of a given density @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , no explicit aspherical density - potential pairs ( with the exception of the kuzmin disk ) have been obtained so far following this approach .",
    "in addition , we note that even `` innocent '' density distributions can produce puzzling behaviors of the mond acceleration field at special places , as illustrated by the perturbative case analyzed by ciotti & binney  ( 2004 ) .    in the alternative",
    "`` @xmath3-to-@xmath4 '' approach  studied in this paper ",
    "one determines the density field by application of the mond operator to a prescribed potential .",
    "this approach is straightforward because only differentiation is involved , but negative densities can be produced if the potential is chosen without the necessary care , as well known also in the newtonian case .",
    "thus , a first problem posed by this approach is to find a criterion to choose @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is positive .",
    "in addition to the positivity condition , one would like to be able to control the _ shape _ and the _ radial trend _ of the resulting density distribution : for example , in newtonian gravity homeoidally stratified potentials lead to curious toroidal density distributions ( e.g. binney  1981 , evans  1994 ) .",
    "as we will see , it is possible  to some degree  to answer positively to these issues .",
    "the idea behind our method is to compute the mond potential of a spherical density distribution .",
    "the obtained potential is then mapped on a new spherical density by means of the laplace operator .",
    "this new density is then suitably deformed and the associated ( newtonian ) potential is determined by standard methods .",
    "finally , the mond differential operator is applied to the deformed potential , and the final density distribution is obtained . in practice , the method consists of the following steps .",
    "\\1 ) we start by selecting a spherical density distribution @xmath28 with the desired radial behavior : for example , it could be a @xmath29-model ( dehnen  1993 ; tremaine et al .",
    "1994 ) , a king  ( 1972 ) density distribution , or a classical polytrope such as the plummer  ( 1911 ) sphere .",
    "we then calculate its dmond potential @xmath30 by using equation  ( [ eqmug ] ) in spherical symmetry : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "as is well known , @xmath33 for any mass distribution of finite total mass @xmath34 .",
    "we stress that we are calculating the dmond potential of @xmath35 irrespective of whether the density distribution is actually dmond everywhere : for example , the jaffe  ( 1983 ) model near the center is not dmond because its acceleration field diverges there , yet we can integrate equation  ( [ eqgz ] ) to obtain @xmath36 .",
    "the reasons for doing so are that equation  ( [ eqgz ] ) is much easier to integrate than the corresponding mond ( spherically symmetric ) equation , and that theorem  2 assures that both the laplacian and the mond operator applied to @xmath36 will produce positive densities .",
    "in particular , the laplace operator applied to @xmath36 leads to the density distribution @xmath37 , \\label{eqrhonz}\\ ] ] while the mond operator in equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) produces @xmath38 . \\label{eqrhomz}\\ ] ] by construction @xmath36 is the dmond potential of @xmath35 , the newtonian potential of @xmath39 , and the mond potential of @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , @xmath40 coincides with @xmath35 where the model is in dmond regime , and with @xmath39 where the gravity field @xmath41 is strong enough . from a more quantitative point of view , @xmath42 when the total mass of @xmath35 is finite , and @xmath43 if @xmath44 @xmath45 in the central regions .",
    "this is apparent from fig .",
    "[ figgamma ] , where we plot @xmath35 ( solid lines ) , @xmath39 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath40 ( empty symbols ) for @xmath29-models with @xmath46 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "\\2 ) in the second step of the procedure we look for an aspherical density @xmath47 to be added to @xmath39 so that @xmath48 is positive for some @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ( defined by @xmath51 ) is explicitly known .",
    "the associated total ( newtonian ) potential is thus @xmath52 .",
    "the main reason for working with newtonian potential at this stage is that the properties of density - potential pairs obeying the poisson equation are well known , and so we can work with confidence and control the deformations of the total @xmath48 .",
    "\\3 ) the final step is the explicit evaluation of the dmond operator in equation  ( [ eqdmond ] ) for the potential @xmath52 , and this can be done with computer algebra packages such as maple or mathematica . for @xmath53",
    "one recovers @xmath36 ( which produces the positive @xmath35 ) , and for continuity one could expect that a positive @xmath4 ( with a radial trend similar to that of @xmath35 ) is also obtained for sufficiently small @xmath54 , though we will show that this is not always the case ) . ] . in general , for given @xmath4 and @xmath47 a critical value of",
    "@xmath54 exists such that only smaller values @xmath54 correspond to physically acceptable ( i.e. nowhere negative ) @xmath4 .",
    "if the resulting density is positive , then theorem  1 assures us that also the full mond operator applied to @xmath3 will produce a positive density distribution ( such that its limit for @xmath55 is @xmath40 ) , provided that @xmath56 . note that the last requirement is just a _ sufficient _ condition for the positivity of @xmath4 .",
    "a first hint about the positivity and the shape of the resulting density can be obtained by studying the linearization of the dmond operator .",
    "in fact , it is easy to prove that the @xmath54-linearized density associated with @xmath52 is @xmath57+o(\\lambda^2 ) , \\label{eqlinrho}\\ ] ] where the spherical symmetry of @xmath36 has been exploited by using the standard spherical coordinates ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , and it is intended that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    from the discussion above",
    "it should be obvious that the delicate step in the procedure is the choice of @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is nowhere negative , @xmath50 is analytical , and the dmond operator produces the sought deformation on @xmath4 .",
    "simple choices satisfying the first two requests could be the addition of miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) or satho ( 1980 ) disks : however , an even more general approach can be devised .",
    "in fact , families of explicit and easy - to - calculate newtonian @xmath63 pairs can be obtained from the homeoidal expansion technique ( e.g. , see cb05 ) . in practice , for the present problem one can adopt as @xmath47 the linear term in the homeoidal expansion of a _ seed density _",
    "@xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 where the dimensionless parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the flattenings of the expanded homeoidal density distribution . the potential @xmath50 generated by the distribution @xmath47",
    "is written in terms of one - dimensional radial integrals that usually can be evaluated explicitly ( see equations [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] in cb05 ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70    we stress that in the present application @xmath66 and @xmath67 are just linear parameters , so without loss of generality the multiplicative coefficient @xmath54 can be considered to be contained in them , and their value is not restricted by the limitations described in appendix a of cb05 .",
    "note also that @xmath47 in equation  ( [ eqrhonu ] ) is _ negative _ when it is derived from an _ oblate _ axisymmetric ( the @xmath71 case ) or triaxial @xmath64 , and so particular care is needed in the choice of @xmath64 , in order to have @xmath72 .",
    "however , for a @xmath64 that can be approximated by a power - law in its external regions , @xmath73 , and so any finite - mass @xmath64 produces through equation  ( [ eqrhonu ] ) a positive total density at large radii , where @xmath74 .",
    "finally we remark that , for @xmath47 as in equation  ( [ eqrhonu ] ) , the quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 in equation  ( [ eqlinrho ] ) are particularly simple because , according to equation  ( [ eqphiu ] ) , the angular part of @xmath50 is just a multiplicative factor of the radial function @xmath77 .",
    "we note that the seemingly obvious choice of taking @xmath47 to be the homeoidal expansion term derived from @xmath39 , does not work .",
    "this is because @xmath74 at large radii , so @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 : equation  ( [ eqlinrho ] ) then reveals that the density is negative for sufficiently large @xmath58 in the conical region @xmath81 .",
    "as we will see , the regions near the @xmath82 axis are in fact the most delicate when applying the analytical technique presented in this paper : unphysical models usually develop negative densities near the @xmath82-axis .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that , when truncated at the first order in @xmath54 , @xmath83 and the @xmath54-linearized @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eqlinrho ] ) allow for the explicit evaluation of the @xmath54-linearized solenoidal field @xmath84 ( the zeroth - order term in @xmath54 is obviously missing because it refers to the spherical density component ) . if @xmath50 is given by equation  ( [ eqphiu ] )",
    "then @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eqlinrho ] ) belongs to the family considered in cb05 and its newtonian potential can be derived in closed form ( while in general this is not possible when considering the density obtained by the application of the dmond operator without @xmath54-linearization ) .",
    "in order to illustrate the method described in section  2 we now construct a triaxial galaxy model with a realistic density distribution and analytical mond potential .",
    "following step 1 , we start with the spherically symmetric hernquist ( 1990 ) density distribution @xmath85 where @xmath86 ; we recall that this density distribution , when projected , is a good approximation of the @xmath87 law ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) over a large radial interval , thus providing a realistic description of the luminous density distribution of elliptical galaxies . from equation  ( [ eqgz ] )",
    "@xmath88 , and so the dmond potential is @xmath89 while from equation  ( [ eqrhonz ] ) @xmath90 in agreement with the discussion in section  2 , @xmath91 in the central regions and @xmath92 in the outer parts of the dmond hernquist model .    according to step 2 , we look for a density distribution @xmath47 to be added to @xmath39 such that the total density is positive and",
    "the potential @xmath50 is explicitly known .",
    "a family of densities that can be easily expanded with the cb05 technique and admit a simple analytical potential @xmath50 is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a density scale , and @xmath95 is the scale - length in units of @xmath96 .",
    "there is nothing special about the distribution ( [ eqvarrho ] ) , which has been chosen only by simplicity arguments : note however that at both small and large radii the total density is dominated by @xmath39 , so its positivity has to be checked only for the intermediate regions . here",
    "we restrict to the case @xmath97 ( see also muccione & ciotti  2004 ) , and from equation  ( [ eqrhonu ] ) @xmath98 so that @xmath99 .",
    "\\label{eqphiusix}\\ ] ]    before computing the dmond operator for @xmath100 it is worth studying its linearization for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and from equation  ( [ eqlinrho ] ) we obtain @xmath103 where the new dimensionless parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are defined as @xmath106 . thus , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , while for @xmath109 @xmath110 i.e. , the linearized density retains the spherical symmetry and radial trend of @xmath35 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so negative values of @xmath4 can be present at intermediate distances only from the center .",
    "for instance , restricting to the axisymmetric case ( @xmath71 ) with @xmath113 , according to equation  ( [ eqlinher])negative values of @xmath4 first appear for @xmath114 along the @xmath82-axis near @xmath115 , and smaller values of @xmath105 correspond to an everywhere positive @xmath4 .",
    "the formula resulting from the evaluation of the dmond operator is not reported here , and we limit ourselves to show the isodensity contours in a pair of representative axisymmetric ( @xmath71 ) cases , fixing @xmath113 . in fig .",
    "[ figden ] ( top left panel ) we show the isodensity contours in the meridional plane for the model with @xmath116 . note how the density is spherically symmetric both in the central regions and at large distances , in accordance with equation  ( [ eqlinher ] ) .",
    "it is particularly important to stress that the maximum flattening of the density corresponds to an axis ratio @xmath117 , even though @xmath105 is much smaller than 0.2 .",
    "this at variance with the newtonian case ( in which the flattening of the expanded density is the same as that of the seed density for small deformations ) , and this is a result of the non - linear nature of mond . in the top right panel of fig .  [ figden ]",
    "we show the density profiles along the symmetry axis ( solid line ) and along a radius in the equatorial plane ( dashed line ) for the same model .",
    "it is apparent how the radial trend of the spherical hernquist model has been nicely preserved by the imposed deformation , again in accordance with equation  ( [ eqlinher ] ) .",
    "note , however , how the density profile along the @xmath82 axis shows a small depression , which becomes more apparent in the model @xmath118 ( fig .",
    "[ figden ] , lower panels ) .",
    "this last model is near the consistency limit in @xmath105 , and the axis ratio of the flattest isodensity surface is @xmath119 .",
    "larger values of @xmath105 would produce a negative density along the @xmath82 axis at @xmath115 , in agreement with the results of the linear analysis .",
    "it should be clear that the presented model is just one of the many analytical triaxial hernquist models one can construct .",
    "for example , one could adopt the @xmath50 derived from the homeoidal expansion of a power - law @xmath64 ( cb05 ) , or just add a quadrupole potential [ i.e. , assume @xmath120 in equation  ( [ eqphiu ] ) ] .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ figdenbis ] we show the density obtained by evaluating the dmond density of the potential @xmath100 , where @xmath36 is still given by equation  ( [ eqphizher ] ) , but @xmath121 the two models shown are characterized by @xmath71 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 ( top ) and @xmath124 ( bottom ) .",
    "overall , we can note that for these models the isodensity surfaces are flat also in the central regions and in the models outskirts , and that the symmetry axis is again the region where the model becomes unphysical for too large @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude this section discussing briefly the global properties of the dmond field @xmath125 for the presented models . in fig .  4 ( left ) we show the field @xmath126 in the meridional plane ,",
    "while in the right panels we plot lines of constant @xmath127 , where @xmath128 ( the newtonian field @xmath129 has been evaluated numerically with a spectral poisson solver ; see section  4 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath127 gives direct information about the relative importance of the solenoidal field with respect to the newtonian gravitational field .",
    "remarkably , as already pointed out by bm95 , also in our case the solenoidal field is typically almost everywhere much smaller than @xmath21 : we find @xmath130 for the family of axisymmetric and triaxial models obtained from equation  ( [ eqphiusix ] ) .",
    "however , we also find that this is not necessarily the rule : for example , @xmath131 in the central regions of the models obtained from equation  ( [ eqphiuq ] ) , and other cases of non - negligible solenoidal field will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections , albeit encouraging , suggest that in order to have a full control on the density field producing the mond potential the best tool is still the numerical solution of equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) . to our knowledge",
    "the only mond numerical solvers presently available are the two - dimensional code developed by milgrom  ( 1986 ) , and the bm95 three - dimensional , multi - grid solver [ used by brada & milgrom ( 1999 ) in their n - body code ] . here , as a complement to the analytical method",

    "it is apparent how the typical errors decrease down to values @xmath187 ; such values are reached in @xmath188 iterations , taking few seconds on a common pc .    as a second set of tests , we studied the razor - thin kuzmin disk ( bm95 ) .",
    "this is a quite severe test , because of the singular nature of the density distribution along the @xmath82 direction . in this case",
    ", we found numerical convergence to the solution , with relative r.m.s .",
    "error @xmath189 for @xmath190 , and @xmath191 .",
    "we note that our code converges also when dealing with multi - centered density distributions , for which the spherical grid is clearly not optimal . in such cases",
    "the convergence is not as fast as in the case of density distributions centered in the origin .",
    "for example , the mond fields of groups of 2 , 3 , and 4 hernquist spheres are computed in @xmath192 iterations , with tolerance @xmath193 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 .    as an illustrative application of the code",
    ", we evaluated the dmond field for the family of homeoidally stratified triaxial hernquist models @xmath194 where @xmath195 and we investigated their solenoidal field for different flattenings .",
    "for example , the model in fig .",
    "[ figcurl ] ( bottom panels ) has @xmath71 and @xmath196 .",
    "the global behavior of @xmath23 is similar to what found for the analytical models of section  3 , with the larger contribution of @xmath23 near the center .",
    "in this case we found maximum values of @xmath197 .",
    "even larger values were found for more flattened models : for instance , @xmath198 in the central regions ( @xmath199 ) of a triaxial model with @xmath200 , @xmath201 .",
    "this is curious because bm95 found similar values of @xmath127 only in the quite artificial case of disks with a central hole .",
    "this last result suggests that when studying mond equilibrium models for disks or elliptical galaxies it could be dangerous to solve equation  ( [ eqmug ] ) just relying on the _ ansatz _ that in any case @xmath23 would be small .",
    "in this paper we presented a few representative axisymmetric and triaxial density models , both analytical and numerical , obeying the mond field equation .",
    "the analytical density - potential pairs are constructed by means of a simple method based on the deformation of the potential of spherically symmetric systems .",
    "we show that in this way it is possible to build systems with radial profiles and shapes similar to those of real galaxies .",
    "our method , although applied in the present paper by using simple deformations is easily generalizable to more complicated cases . as a complement to the analytical method",
    ", we also presented a numerical code ( based on spectral methods ) to solve the mond field equation .",
    "we tested the code against the new analytical triaxial models and the mond kuzmin disk , with excellent results in terms of both computational time and accuracy of the numerical solution .",
    "as a first simple application of the code , we explored the relevance of the solenoidal field @xmath23 in mond distributions .",
    "though we confirm that this field is typically small compared to the newtonian field of the density distribution , we also found that for some systems @xmath23 is certainly not negligible , at least in some regions of space .",
    "a particularly important application of the numerical solver will be its implementation in a particle - mesh n - body code .",
    "such an implementation is promising , because our mond solver is based on an iterative scheme , and at each time in a n - body simulation the potential at the previous time is a very good seed for the iterative procedure that should converge efficiently .",
    "more immediate possible applications of the presented analytical models and numerical code are the study of mond orbits in aspherical density distributions , and the vertical motions of stars near the galactic plane .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that the developed numerical code can also be used to solve the equation for the scalar field in the non - relativistic limit of teves , the relativistic mond theory introduced by bekenstein  ( 2004 ; equation  53 ) , allowing , for example , to investigate mond gravitational lensing from non - spherical lenses .",
    "we are grateful to james  binney , hongsheng  zhao , and the anonymous referee for very useful comments .",
    "this work was partially supported by a miur grant cofin2004 .",
    "we present here three existence theorems that are at the basis of the technique presented in section 2 .",
    "the first result holds in general , while the second and third results assume spherical symmetry .",
    "* theorem 1 * _ let @xmath22 the newtonian potential generated by a positive density distribution , i.e. @xmath202 over the whole space .",
    "if @xmath203 over the whole space , then also @xmath204\\geq 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is given in equation  ( [ eqmu ] ) .",
    "_    * proof * equation  ( a3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath205= { 1\\over\\sqrt{{a_0}^2+{g_{\\rm n}}^2 } } \\left ( { g_{\\rm n}}\\nabla^2{\\phi_{\\rm n}}+   { \\nabla{g_{\\rm n}}\\cdot\\nabla{\\phi_{\\rm n}}\\over 1+{g_{\\rm n}}^2/{a_0}^2}\\right ) , \\ ] ] from condition ( a1 ) a negative density can be produced only in the region of space @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "if @xmath208 the theorem is proved , thus let @xmath209 . in this case , by expansion of inequality ( a2 ) we have that on @xmath206 @xmath210 and this proves the theorem .        * proof * direct calculation of @xmath214 in spherical symmetry , as done in equation  ( [ eqrhonz ] ) , proves equation  ( [ eqlaplpos ] ) .",
    "conditions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) are then verified and this proves equation  ( [ eqmondpos ] ) .",
