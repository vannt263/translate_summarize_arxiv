    "[ sec : intro ]    trap models have been proposed as qualitative models exhibiting localization and aging ( see  @xcite for early references ) . in the mathematics literature",
    "there has recently been an interest in establishing such results for a varied class of such models ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in particular",
    ", it has been recognized that scaling limits play an important role in such derivations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it may be argued that such phenomena correspond to related phenomena exhibited by limiting models .",
    "in this paper we consider symmetric trap models in the hypercube whose mean waiting times converge as a measure to a finite measure as the dimension diverges , and show that these models converge weakly .",
    "we then apply this result to establish the scaling limits of two dynamics in the hypercube , namely the rem - like trap model and the random hopping times dynamics for the random energy model , in time scales corresponding to the ergodic regime for these dynamics .",
    "[ ssec : modres ]    let @xmath3 denote the @xmath0-dimensional hypercube , namely @xmath3 is the graph @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamming distance in @xmath7",
    ".    we will consider symmetric trap models in @xmath8 , namely continuous time , space inhomogeneous , simple random walks in @xmath8 , whose transition probabilities ( from each site of @xmath8 to any of its @xmath0 nearest neighbors ) are uniform .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of mean waiting times characterizing the model .",
    "we will map @xmath10 onto the set @xmath11 by enumerating @xmath10 in decreasing order of @xmath12 ( with an arbitrary tie breaking rule ) , and then consider @xmath13 , the mapped process .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the enumeration in decreasing order of @xmath12 , and view it as a finite measure in @xmath15 , the positive natural numbers .",
    "we next consider a class of processes which turns out to contain limits of trap models in @xmath8 as @xmath2 , as we will see below .",
    "let @xmath16 be i.i.d .",
    "poisson processes of rate 1 , with @xmath17 the @xmath18-th event time of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and let @xmath22 be i.i.d",

    "was introduced and studied in  @xcite , where it was shown to arise as limits of trap models in the complete graph with @xmath36 vertices as @xmath37 ( see lemma 3.11 in  @xcite ) . in the next section ,",
    "we derive a similar result for the hypercube .",
    "see theorem  [ teo : main ] .",
    "this is our main technical result .",
    "then , in the following section , we apply that result to get the scaling limits of the rem - like trap model and the random hopping times dynamics for the rem in ergodic time scales as k processes .",

    "then , @xmath13 converges weakly in skorohod space as @xmath2 to a k process with parameter @xmath39 and initial measure @xmath41 .",
    "this result extends the analysis performed in  @xcite for the trap model in the complete graph , with a similar approach ( see lemma 3.11 in  @xcite and its proof ) .",
    "the extra difficulty here comes from the fact that the transition probabilities in the hypercube are not uniform in the state space , as is the case in the complete graph .",
    "however , all that is indeed needed is an approximate uniform entrance law in finite sets of states .",

    "the approximations will be strong ones : we will couple @xmath43 to @xmath59 and @xmath59 to @xmath52 , in the spirit of theorem 5.2 in  @xcite , where the approximation of @xmath31 by @xmath52 , needed here as the last step of the argument , was established . in particular , we also couple @xmath60 to @xmath61 so that the former converges almost surely to the latter as @xmath2 .",
