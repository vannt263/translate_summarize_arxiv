    "the htl ( hard thermal loop)resumed propagators , i.e . this htl resumed technique is introduced by braaten and pisarski @xcite , to cure some serious problem of gauge theories at finite temperature , such as ir singularity and gauge dependent results , when the bare propagators ( vertices ) are used .",
    "some gauge independent physical quantities are given with the htl resumed propagators in the calculation , other than the bare propagators at finite temperature .",
    "the htl approximation is the high temperature limit .",
    "if the momentum of the propagators are soft at finite temperature , we should use the htl resumed propagators .",
    "multi - loop htl diagrams can give a low order contribution in the coupling constant at finite temperature , which should be resumed .",
    "because of the htl resummation , the medium effects are taken into account , such as the debye screening caused by the color charges of the qgp .",
    "the htl resummation technique represents a great progress compared to the bare perturbation theory at finite temperature .",
    "photon production is a good hard probe to study the formation and evolution of the quark - gluon plasma in the experiment of the heavy ion collisions . for the leading order photon emission rate , due to the near - collinear singularities , bremsstrahlung and inelastic pair annihilation give the leading order contribution as two - to - two particle processes@xcite . by power",
    "counting , these two processes with multiple collinear soft gluon scattering still contribute at the leading order . sum these infinite class diagrams , and the result can give an @xmath1 suppression , which limits the coherence length of the emitted radiation .",
    "this is the lpm effect ( landau - pomeranchuck - migdal)@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the htl resumed gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge is used to handle the situation of the soft gluons .",
    "the light cone gauge is one of non - covariant gauges @xcite,@xcite , and is also ghost - free .",
    "when the multiple gluon emission is calculated in the light cone gauge , the differential cross section with @xmath2-gluon emission in the leading pole approximation has a simple ladder structure @xcite . in the light cone",
    "gauge interference terms do not contribute to the leading order .",
    "these nice properties simplify the calculation .",
    "however , the light cone gauge has its disadvantage , such as the spurious singularity of @xmath3 , the renormalization and so on . in the experiment of the heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum of the parton is very large , the transverse momentum is very small , and it is suitable to calculate in light cone gauge .    for considering the medium effects in the light cone gauge , we should work out the transverse and longitudinal parts of the gluon htl self energy in the light cone gauge and derive the htl resumed gluon propagator .",

    "at zero temperature , covariant gauge have a definite advantage over non - covariant gauges such as the coulomb gauge or axial gauges .",
    "calculations are simplified considerably due to lorentz invariance , and the renormalization program can be implemented in practice only in covariant gauge . at finite temperature ,",
