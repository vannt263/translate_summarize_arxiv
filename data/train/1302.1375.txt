    "because of the finite response time of the node , intermediate output states have been numerically and experimentally observed .",
    "the consequence of the autonomous operation and the resulting non - ideal behavior of the gate is the existence of rich and complex dynamics , such as chaos@xcite and quasi - periodicity.@xcite    fpgas allow one to realize experimentally large abns to test theoretical predictions@xcite of models of boolean networks .",
    "the experimental approach reveals dynamics that is not predicted in theoretical studies , which usually neglect non - ideal behaviors that may appear both in the biological and electrical systems , such as the sigmoidal activation functions of the gates , intrinsic parameter heterogeneity , and noise .",

    "in contrast , a numerical simulation of an abn requires multiple calculations for the continuous rises and falls for each logic gate in the network , which usually takes time on the order of milliseconds with current computer technology . with our approach ,",
    "the network dynamics are , therefore , much faster generated than with the corresponding simulation .    in this article",
    ", we demonstrate the potential of fpgas to realize experimentally large - scale complex networks with controllable node dynamics and arbitrary topology .",
    "the networks are meta - networks consisting of interconnected autonomous logic circuits  an electronic realization of abns  that represent dynamical nodes with various types of dynamics .",
    "we first introduce the fpga and its autonomous mode of operation .",
    "then , we introduce a boolean phase oscillator and couple it to networks that display phase synchronization .",
    "we continue by introducing an abn that displays chaotic dynamics .",
    "finally , we realize abns with excitable dynamics that can be coupled to large networks and synchronize with zero - time lag in the presence of coupling time delays .",
    "in this section , we introduce the main working principles of fpgas .",
    "we detail how to implement time - continuous dynamical nodes ( abns ) and connect them with time delay links into meta - networks .",
    "an fpga has up to 2 million re - assignable logic gates that generate high and low voltages @xmath1 corresponding to the boolean states 0 and 1 .",
    "they can execute any of the @xmath2 possible logic functions , where @xmath3 is the number of inputs whose value is typically four or six depending on the fpga technology . for our experimental platform ( altera cyclone iv ep4ce115f29c7n ) , @xmath4 .",
    "logic operations with more inputs can be realized by combining multiple logic gates .",
    "the logic circuit  the logic gates and their interconnection  is specified using a hardware description language , such as verilog or vhdl.@xcite a compiler optimizes and converts the logic design so that it can be loaded on the fpga , thereby specifying the boolean operation of each logic element and the manner in which they are connected .",
    "these operations take as little as a few seconds depending on the complexity of the design .",
    "the flexibility , the speed , and the large number of available logic gates render the fpga a promising platform for the realization of network experiments with large network sizes and complex topologies .",
    "the mode of operation of the logic gates has important implications for the dynamics of the logic circuit on the fpga . in most applications of fpgas ,",
    "they are used in the synchronous operation with a clock period slow enough so that all logic gates can settle to their boolean states between two consecutive clock cycles.@xcite then , the logic gates behave in a digital fashion consistent with the boolean algebra . in the autonomous mode of operation , in contrast , the logic circuit displays an analog dynamical evolution governed by the logic gates propagation delays , gate activation function , and low - pass filtering characteristics.@xcite these properties vary between the logic gates on a chip because of manufacturing imperfections .",
    "consequently , two autonomous logic circuits of identical layout that are realized on different regions on the fpga can display somewhat non - identical dynamics .      to build dynamical networks ,",

    "links with substantially longer time delay can also be realized by exploiting the finite propagation time of logic gates .",
    "specifically , time delay links are built by cascading an even number of @xmath6 inverter gates to achieve a time delay of @xmath7 . a delay line built from an even number of consecutive inverter ( not ) gates transmits the logic state of the input to the output .",

    "some logic gates would be redundant in synchronous operation and would , therefore , be removed by the compiler .",
    "to realize an experimental meta network with two of these abns , we consider a module ` main ` in which we call two instanciations of the periodic oscillators ` osc1 ` and ` osc2 ` as described by the following hardware description    module main(out ) ; assign out = net1 ; my_osc osc1(net2 , net1 ) ; my_osc osc2(net1 , net2 ) ; endmodule    the output ` net1 ` of the oscillator called ` osc1 ` is input to oscillator ` osc2 ` .",

    "their frequencies differ because of the additional or gate in ( s ) and heterogeneity in the propagation delay of the logic gates . as a result ,",
    "the two oscillators are not frequency - locked without coupling . however , when the master oscillator ( m ) injects its output waveform into the slave oscillator ( s ) , phase- and frequency - locking is achieved with frequency @xmath16 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "a skew time @xmath21 is used to compensate for the additional propagation time of the or gate , the difference in propagation time of the two signals to the output port of the fpga to the oscilloscope , and for a small propagation delay in the coupling .",
    "the stable phase - locked dynamics corresponds to one boolean transition propagating in each oscillator with constant relative phase shift .",
    "the or gate used in ( s ) leads to the creation of a boolean transition in ( s ) whenever ( m ) generates a boolean transition ( @xmath22 ) and ( s ) is in the @xmath23 state .",
    "this implies that multiple transitions can potentially propagate in ( s ) if ( m ) and ( s ) are not phase locked .",
    "however , the most stable evolution for ( s ) has a single transition propagating ; this results in @xmath24 adjusting to @xmath25 .",
    "using an or gate for the coupling of ring oscillators prevents an accumulation of boolean transitions in ( s ) : if one of the two inputs is in @xmath26 , then a boolean transition ( @xmath22 ) in the other input has no influence on the output of the or logic gate .",

    "interestingly , our experimental result on mutual synchronization is reminiscent of phase synchronization states predicted theoretically for two coupled kuramoto oscillators with time - delay feedback loops and links.@xcite in their study , however , the periodic oscillator can oscillate without the presence of time - delayed feedback , which is not the case for our boolean phase oscillator  without the time - delayed feedback , our boolean oscillator reduces to an or and a not gate with a fixed boolean state .",
    "similar behavior has been observed numerically for two delay - coupled fitzhugh - nagumo systems , each of which is in the excitable regime , i.e. , does not exhibit self - sustained oscillations in the uncoupled case.@xcite    in our experiments , the coupling mechanism is the same in both the unidirectional and bidirectional case but differs from typical kuramoto oscillator , as it can be understood in terms of the exchange of boolean transitions .",
    "the or gate in each oscillator generates boolean transitions when the signal of an external boolean transition is received .",

    "the experimental network is considered to be in a near - zero - lag single synchronization cluster , which is consistent with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this experimental confirmation suggests that our boolean excitable nodes can be used generically to observe other collective phenomena in artificial neural networks .      in this section ,",
    "we measure synchronized neural activity in a neural network of 80 excitable nodes .",
    "we show that abns can be used to build large meta - networks of neural excitable dynamics . various synchronization patterns and",
    "more general dynamics are expected for high in - degrees of nodes and for a different choice of the synapses than an or gate .",
    "for example , the flexibility of the logic function will allow for implementation of inhibiting connections .",
    "besides potential insights into neurodynamics , our excitable boolean node may become invaluable for neuro - inspired computing , such as reservoir computing,@xcite especially because the nanosecond time - scale of the dynamics will allow for fast processing rates .",
    "we demonstrate that an fpga is a versatile experimental platform to conduct integrated experiments on the dynamics of complex networks .",
    "when assembling logic gates in their autonomous mode of operation , one can create autonomous boolean networks ( abns ) that display rich and complex dynamics such as periodic oscillations , chaos , and excitable dynamics .",
    "the abns with these dynamics can be further coupled with time - delay links to form autonomous boolean meta - networks that are used to conduct experiments on collective phenomena .",
    "we propose boolean analogies of three paradigmatic configurations arising in nonlinear dynamics : ( i ) phase synchronization in simple network motifs of oscillatory systems , ( ii ) chaotic dynamics , and ( iii ) synchronization phenomena in networks of excitable systems .",
    "these three sets of experiments pave the way towards filling the gap between the theory of dynamic networks and desirable experiments , since our approach allows for the realization of large networks with arbitrary topologies on an fpga .",
    "nevertheless , our approach still presents many technical and scientific challenges .",
    "for example , the experimental extraction of data from each node is only partially solved for networks of excitable systems using the data acquisition capabilities of fpgas .",
    "the greatest challenge in using fpgas for network experiments is to find the boolean analogy for the desired dynamical node and the coupling while satisfying technological constraints imposed by the fpga platform .",
