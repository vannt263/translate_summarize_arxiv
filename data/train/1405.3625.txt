    "turbulent transport and mixing play an essential role in many natural and industrial processes @xcite , in cloud formation @xcite , in chemical reactors and combustion systems @xcite , and atmospheric and oceanographic turbulence determines the spread of pollutants and biological agents in geophysical flows @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "concentration fluctuations are often of great importance in such systems and this is related to the separation of nearby fluid particles ; turbulent pair diffusion therefore plays a critical role in such systems .",
    "the idea of locality has been fundamental to the theory of turbulent particle pair diffusion since richardson s pioneering paper , @xcite , which established turbulent pair diffusion as an important scientific discipline and laid the foundations for a theory of how ensembles of pairs of fluid particles ( tracers ) initially close together move apart due to the effects of atmospheric winds and turbulence .",
    "richardson argued that as particle pairs separate the rate at which they move apart is affected mostly by eddies of the same scale as the separation distance itself  this is the basis of the locality hypothesis .",
    "richardson was also motivated by a desire to bring molecular and turbulent pair diffusional processes into a unified picture through the use of a single non - fickian diffusion equation with scale dependent diffusivity , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pair separation variable .",
    "assuming homogeneous isotropic turbulence , richardson posed the problem in 3d in terms of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the pair separation , @xmath15 , and assuming the normalization , @xmath16 , he suggested the following diffusion equation to describe @xmath17 , @xmath18    the scaling of the pair diffusivity @xmath19 with the pair separation and what it means for the pair diffusion process is of paramount importance .",
    "from observational data of turbulent pair diffusivities collected from different sources , richardson assumed an approximate fit to the data namely , @xmath20 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath21 , @xcite , @xcite , often referred to as the richardson - obukov @xmath22-regime .",
    "@xmath23 is the pair separation , @xmath24 is the time , and the angled brackets is the ensemble average over particle pairs .",
    "it is no longer believed that it is possible to unify molecular and turbulent diffusional processes because their physics are fundamentally different ; brownian motion characterizes molecular diffusion , while convective gusts of winds that increase the pair separation in surges characterizes turbulent diffusion @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . nevertheless , the idea of a scale dependent turbulent diffusivity has survived .",
    "richardson s assumed 4/3-scaling law is equivalent to a locality hypothesis , according to which for asymptotically large reynolds number only the energy in eddies whose size is of a similar scale to the pair separation inside the inertial subrange is effective in further increasing the pair separation .",
    "furthermore , richardson s scaling for the pair diffusion is consistent with @xcite , ( k41 ) ; this can be seen from the form of the turbulence energy spectrum in the inertial subrange which is , @xmath25 , from which it follows that the pair diffusivity depends only upon @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( the rate of kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass ) .",
    "this leads directly to the locality scaling , @xmath28 .",
    "it is usual to evaluate @xmath19 at typical values of , @xmath26 , namely at @xmath29 , so this scaling is replaced by , @xmath30 .",
    "the requirement of large reynolds number , @xmath31 , implies that this scaling is true only inside an asymptotically infinite inertial subrange , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the kolmogorov micro - scale and @xmath35 is a scale characteristic of energy containing eddies , typically the integral length scale , or the taylor length scale . in this limit ,",
    "the pair separation is initially zero , @xmath36 , as @xmath37 .    for finite inertial subrange ,",
    "there are infra - red and ultra - violet boundary corrections so the inertial subrange still has to be very large in order to avoid these effects and to observe inertial subrange scaling in the pair diffusion . with the 4/3-scaling for @xmath19 , an explicit solution for equation ( 1.1 ) for diffusion from a point source with boundary conditions @xmath38 ,",
    "can be derived , @xmath39    turbulence is both scale dependent and time correlated ( non - markovian ) , and it is not clear whether the pdf in equation ( 1.2 ) , which describes a local and markovian process , can accurately represent the turbulent pair diffusion process .",
    "attempts have been made to derive alternative non - markovian models for pair diffusion , @xcite , @xcite , and this remains a subject of ongoing scientific research .",
    "however , this does not affect richardson s hypothesis of scale dependent diffusivity , which is the main focus of this study .",
    "it is possible to generalize the scaling for the pair diffusivity to be time dependent and still be consistent with k41 and with locality , @xcite , @xcite , such that ,    @xmath40    for some @xmath41,and @xmath42 .",
    "dimensional consistency then gives , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which leads to @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "thus we obtain ,    @xmath47    if the further constraint @xmath48 is satisfied , then this yields , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , a @xmath22-regime is not a unique signature for richardson s 4/3-scaling for the pair diffusivity .",
    "however , a time dependent pair diffusivity is hard to justify physically if we assume steady state equilibrium turbulence , because a time dependent diffusivity implies , for @xmath50 that the pair diffusivity at the same separation is ever increasing in time without limit , or for @xmath51 that the pair diffusivity approaches zero with time and the separation process effectively stops .",
    "both cases seem unlikely , and in the ensuing we will restrict the discussion to steady state equilibrium turbulence and consider only the case , @xmath52 .",
    "however , it is worth remarking that time - dependent diffusivities like equation ( 1.3 ) may exist in the context of non - equilibrium turbulence .",
    "the main aims of this research are two - fold .",
    "firstly , to re - examine the body of evidence available on turbulent pair diffusion especially , if any , from large scale turbulence containing large inertial subranges , section 2 .",
    "particular attention is focussed upon a reappraisal of richardson s original 1926 dataset , section 3 . secondly , based upon these findings , a new theory that does",
    "not _ a priori _ make the assumption of locality is constructed from which new scaling laws for the pair diffusivity is derived through a novel mathematical method , and compared to the reappraised 1926 dataset , in section 4 .",
    "finally , a lagrangian diffusion model is used to examine the new theory and the results from the simulations are found to agree closely with the 1926 dataset and with the predictions of the new theory , section 5 .",
    "we discuss the significance of these findings and draw conclusions in section 6 .",
    "although the general consensus among scientists in the field at the current time is that the collection of observational data , experimental data , and direct numerical simulation , suggests a convergence towards a richard - obukov locality scaling , the relatively low reynolds numbers in the experiments and dns , and the high error levels , and other assumptions made in collecting the data means that this is by no means a forgone conclusion . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "`` .. there has not been an experiment that has unequivocally confirmed r - o scaling over a broad - enough range of time and with sufficient accuracy . ''",
    "it is not known precisely what size of the inertial subrange is required to observe unequivocally the pair diffusion scaling , but it is widely assumed to be about at least four orders of magnitude or more . only geophysical turbulent flows , such as in the atmosphere and in the oceans , can produce such extended inertial subranges .    a number of claims of observing locality scaling , including the existence of an approximate @xmath22-regime in geophysical flows , have been made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more recent observations include @xcite in the atmosphere , and @xcite , and @xcite in the oceans .",
    "but high error levels and other assumptions ( such as two - dimensionality ) made in these observations means that decisive conclusions can not be drawn from them regarding pair diffusion theories .     direct numerical simulations ( dns )",
    "is inconclusive at the current time because it does not produce a big enough inertial subrange in order to be able to test pair diffusion laws reliably .",
    "for example , @xcite perform a dns with @xmath53 , at taylor scale based reynolds numbers @xmath54 showing an approximate inertial subrange energy spectrum over a very short range of just 40 .",
    "other dns of particle pair studies at low reynolds numbers are , @xcite at @xmath55 , @xcite at @xmath56 , @xcite at @xmath57 , @xcite at @xmath58 , @xcite at @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite at @xmath60 .",
    "see also @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the maximum separation of time scales between the integral time scale and the kolmogorov times scale observed to date in dns is about a factor of , 100 .",
    "this is still about two orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum size required to adequately test inertial subrange pair diffusion scalings . for 2d turbulence ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) laboratory experiments @xcite , @xcite have been providing pair diffusion statistics at low to moderate reynolds numbers .",
    "like dns , these reynolds numbers are too small to reliably test pair diffusion laws .",
    "@xcite obtain pair diffusion measurements from ptv .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained measurements in a water tank at @xmath61 , and @xcite and @xcite tracked hundreds of particles at high temporal resolution at @xmath62 .",
    "although higher resolution tracking experiments using high - energy physics methods have been performed for single particle trajectories @xcite , they have not yet been applied to particle pair studies .    when intermittency is accounted for",
    ", the scaling in fully developed turbulence should in fact be slightly greater than the r - o scaling .",
    "this will be discussed further in discussions and conclusions , section 6 .",
    "@xcite reported in the proceedings of the royal society of london data on turbulent diffusivities collected from different sources , which is reproduced here with a brief description in table 1 .",
    "he plotted the turbulent diffusivity against the pair separation in log - log scale , shown as the red and black filled circles in figure 1 .",
    "motivated by an attempt to unify pair diffusional processes across all possible scales , he assumed the scaling @xmath20 as a reasonable fit ( fig .",
    "1 , dotted blue line ) .",
    "this is not the least squares line of best fit to the data , it is just a theoretical approximation to the data .",
    "the actual line of best fit is , @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "1 , solid red line ) .    @xcite and @xcite , commenting on diffusion of floats in the sea noted that their new measurements were roughly consistent with the 1926 data , i.e. @xmath20 . at the end of their paper they wrote , ``",
    "note added in proof .  after this manuscript was submitted the writers have read two unpublished manuscripts by c. l. von weisaecker and w. heisenberg in which the problem of turbulence for large reynolds number is treated deductively with the result that they arrive at the 4/3 law .",
    "the agreement between von weisaecker and heisenberg s deduction and our quite independent induction is a confirmation of both '' , see @xcite .",
    "but they also observed that , `` any power between @xmath64 and @xmath65 would be a tolerable fit to the data '' .",
    "thus , as early as 1948 , it was noted that @xmath20 was only a rough fit , which makes it all the more surprising that an alternative theory for pair diffusion has not been developed till now .",

    "the range of separation over which the scalings , @xmath86 , are observed to progressively reduce from both ends of the range as @xmath83 .",
    "it reduces from below due to the diminishing energies contained in the smallest scales so that the pair separation penetrates further into the inertial subrange before it forgets the initial separation .",
    "it reduces from above because the long range correlations are increasingly stronger as @xmath83 causing the particles in a pair to become independent at earlier times and at smaller separation .",
    "the plot of @xmath87 against @xmath74 show a peak at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , ( fig . 7 , right hand scale ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath87 remains relatively close to this peak value in a neighbourhood of @xmath90 , in the range @xmath91 .",
    "plots of the scaling powers , @xmath92 , obtained from the simulations ( filled black circles ) , and from @xmath93 ( dotted blue line ) , against @xmath74 are shown in figure 8 .",

    "it is reasonable to infer that the error will be almost zero close to @xmath113 .",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum @xmath94 produces , @xmath114 , and the error in the scaling power is @xmath115 .",
    "the richardson s locality law , @xmath2 , is @xmath116 in error in the scaling power compared to the reappraised geophysical data in figure 1 .",
    "the simulations produce scalings for @xmath117 , in the range @xmath118 to @xmath119 for the same intermittent spectra considered above , fig .",
    "9 , table 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that even under the assumption of locality intermittency spectra should produce scalings in the range @xmath120 to @xmath121  thus , a true r - o @xmath22-regime can not exist in reality",
    ".    in general ks predicts the correct scaling for the turbulent pair diffusivity to within @xmath78 of the geophysical data in figure 1 in most of the accepted intermittency range centred in the neighbourhood of , @xmath122 .",
    "finally , ks produces a non - richardson 4/3-scaling , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 at @xmath125 , ( fig . 7 and table 1 ) . with this spectrum , @xmath126 , this is equivalent to a new @xmath127 regime .",
    "the numerical results presented here are the most comprehensive obtained to date from ks due to the very large ensemble of particle pairs and the small time steps used .",
    "the statistical fluctuations in the results are therefore small .",
    "the @xmath128s , which are the slopes of the plots in figure 5 , can be determined to within @xmath78 error .",
    "an exception is close to the singular limit @xmath79 where the numerical errors can be large .",
    "an accurate estimate of this error can be obtained as follows , noting first that the error level in @xmath7 is identical to the error level in @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath81 , then @xmath129 ; but very close to this limit , @xmath130 is still a good approximation . for @xmath131 ,",
    "ks produces , @xmath132 ( fig . 7 and table 1 ) .",
    "this is an error of @xmath80 which is small considering that it is so close to the singular limit .",
    "an error of around @xmath78 away from @xmath79 is therefore reasonable . in the limit @xmath133",
    "there is no detectible error in @xmath87 from ks to three decimal places ( table 2 ) .",
    "ks is an established method used by many researchers in turbulent diffusion studies , as noted in the earlier references in this paper .",
    "however , some researchers , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , have expressed reservations regarding ks which they believe produces incorrect scalings for pair diffusion statistics because of the lack of true dynamical sweeping of the inertial scales eddies by the larger scales . these authors strongly support locality which they believe to be true in reality , and their inference that ks _",
    "mus_t be incorrect is a direct consequence of this thinking . as we are examining the hypothesis of locality itself here , such a presumption can not be taken as a given .",
    "furthermore , @xcite has shown through an analysis of pairs of trajectories that the quantitative errors in ks due to the sweeping effect is in fact negligible provided that the simulations are carried out in a frame of reference moving with the large scale sweeping flow .",
    "the close agreement of ks with the geophysical data in figure 1 obtained here provides further support for this conclusion .",
    "richardson pioneered the scientific discipline of turbulent particle pair diffusion , and assumed a locality scaling for the pair diffusivity due to the inclusion of one data - point from a non - turbulent context .",
    "here , the reappraised 1926 data shows an unequivocal non - local scaling for the turbulent pair diffusivity , @xmath134 , fig .",
    "1 . consequently",
    ", the foundations of turbulent pair diffusion theory have been re - examined here in an effort to resolve one of the most important and enduring problems in turbulence .",
    "the main contribution of this investigation is to propose a new non - local theory of turbulent particle pair diffusion based upon the principle that the turbulent pair diffusion process in homogeneous turbulence is governed by both local and non - local diffusional processes .",
    "the theory preditcs that in turbulence with generalized energy spectra , @xmath4 , over extended inertial subranges , the pair diffusivity scales like , @xmath6 , with @xmath8 , in the range @xmath5 , which is intermediate between the purely local and purely non - local scaling power laws .",
    "the reappraised 1926 geophysical data , fig .",
    "1 , table 1 , provides strong support for the new theory .",
    "additional support comes from a lagrangian simulation method , ks , whose results for turbulence with intermittency is in remarkably close agreement with the geophysical data in figure 1 , to within @xmath78 error in the scaling power for energy spectra in the accepted range of intermittency ; for @xmath135 , ks produces , @xmath136 , which is an error of just @xmath137 in the scaling power .",
    "all other predictions of the new theory have also been confirmed using ks .",
    "thus , an important corollary of the present work is that ks is a more accurate lagrangian simulation method than previously thought .",
    "a detailed mathematical approach has been developed by expressing the pair diffusivity through a fourier integral decomposition . _",
    "a priori _ assumptions regarding locality was not made , and this has led to an expression for @xmath19 as the sum of local and non - local contributions , equation ( 4.29 ) .",
    "a feature of this approach is that it illustrates how various scalings and closure assumptions are inherent in developing any theory for pair diffusion .",
    "such assumptions are always present even in apparently simpler scaling rules , but are often hidden and unstated .",
    "this work also raises questions about previous works .",
    "some dns in particular have reported pair separation scaling that are close to , @xmath138 .",
    "how convincing is this in support of a locality hypothesis ?    in the first place , richardson s 1926 data still remains the most comprehensive data on large geophysical scales till now , and it shows unequivocal non - local scaling .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile this with the apparent locality scaling reported in some studies , especially in view of the very short inertial subranges that they contain .",
    "furthermore , fully developed turbulence containing intermittency in a large inertial subrange should not in fact produce a r - o scaling of , @xmath2 , even under the locality hypothesis as we have seen in section 5.4 .",
    "the scaling in @xmath139 in particular is very sensitive to the power in the energy spectrum through equation ( 41 ) . with",
    "the intermittency observed in real turbulence and under the assumption of locality this would produce a scaling of , @xmath140 to @xmath141 , or equivalently @xmath142 to @xmath121 , which should be detectable if present ; but except for richardson s revised 1926 dataset presented here , no study has reported a scaling greater than @xmath138 strongly indicating that asymptotically large inertial subranges have not yet been achieved in experiments and dns .",
    "it is expected that attention will now turn towards the implications of this new theory for the general theory of turbulence , and for turbulence diffusion modeling strategies . + * acknowledgements * the author would like to thank sabic for funding this work through project number sb101011 , and the itc department at kfupm for making available the high performance computing facility for this project .",
