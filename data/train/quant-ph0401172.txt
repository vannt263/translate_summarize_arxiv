    "the use of phase - sensitive environments has been addressed by many authors @xcite for preservation of macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "in fact , by adding _ squeezed _ fluctuations to dissipation , superpositions of states preserve their coherence longer than in presence of dissipation alone .",
    "a question arises whether or not phase - sensitive environments may be also used to preserve entanglement . in this paper ,",
    "in particular , we study the behavior of a twin - beam state of radiation ( twb ) propagating through a gaussian noisy phase - sensitive channel , in order to investigate whether or not squeezing the environment is useful to preserve continuous variable entanglement .",
    "the answer turns out to be negative .",
    "the survival time of entanglement in a squeezed bath is always smaller than in purely dissipative or thermal ones , and the degradation is more pronounced as far as the bath fluctuations are out of the twb phase .",
    "the propagation of a twb interacting with a general gaussian environment , can be modeled as the coupling of each part of the state with a non - zero temperature squeezed reservoir .",
    "the dynamics can be described by the two - mode master equation @xmath0+\\gamma ( 1+n ) l[b]+\\gamma n l[a^{\\dag } ] + \\gamma n l[b^{\\dag } ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\mbox { } & \\hspace{0.4cm}+ \\gamma m \\mathcal{m}[a^{\\dag } ] + \\gamma m^ * \\mathcal{m}[a ] + \\gamma m \\mathcal{m}[b^{\\dag } ] + \\gamma m^ * \\mathcal{m}[b ] \\}\\rho_t \\ , , \\label{master : squeezed}\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the system s density matrix at the time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the damping rate and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the effective photons number and the squeezing parameter of the bath respectively ( which are assumed to be equal for the two channels ) . @xmath6 $ ] is the lindblad superoperator , @xmath6\\rho_t = o\\rho_t o^{\\dag } -\\frac12 o^{\\dag}o\\rho_t - \\frac12 \\rho_t o^{\\dag } o$ ] , and @xmath7\\rho_t = o\\rho_t o - \\frac12 o o \\rho_t - \\frac12 \\rho_t o o $ ] .",
    "of course , the dynamics of the two modes are independent on each other .    using the differential representation of the superoperators in equation ( [ master : squeezed ] ) , the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the two - mode wigner function @xmath8 is given by @xcite @xmath9 where , for the sake of simplicity , we put @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in equation ( [ wigner : master : squeezed ] )",

    "a quantum state of a bipartite system is _ separable _ if its density operator can be written as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a probability distribution and @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s are single - system density matrices .",
    "if a state is separable the correlations between the two systems are of purely classical origin , otherwise it is entangled .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of gaussian states is the positivity of the density matrix @xmath47 , obtained by partial transposition of the original density matrix ( ppt condition ) @xcite .",
    "notice that the wigner function of a twin - beam is gaussian and the evolution in a gaussian environment preserves such character .",
    "therefore , we are able to characterize the entanglement at any time and discuss its degradation as a function of bath s parameters .",

    "since @xmath67 is always negative , we conclude that coupling a twb with an _ in - phase _ squeezed bath destroys entanglement faster than the coupling with a non squeezed environment .",
    "we have also evaluated the threshold time for separability in case of an _ out - of - phase _ squeezed bath _",
    "i.e. _ for complex @xmath70 .",
    "the analytical expression is quite cumbersome and will not be reported here . however , in order to investigate the positivity of @xmath71 as a function of @xmath72 , it suffices to consider the characteristic polynomial @xmath73 associated to @xmath71 , and study the sign of its roots .",

    "in other words , the survival time becomes shorter .",
