    "we d like to introduce multi - party qdc by focusing on the simplest case of two - dimension qdc between three parties .",
    "assume in the following case that alice is the only receiver while bob and claire are two senders .",
    "the three parties previously share a three - qubit ghz state : @xmath4    then bob and claire are to operate locally on their qubits respectively and independently .",
    "if their single - qubit unitary operations are chosen appropriately , @xmath5 will change into one of the following 8 three - qubit maximal entangled states : @xmath6    then bob and claire should send both their qubits to alice in quantum channels .",
    "alice then performs a collective measurement to find out which one of the 8 orthogonal states in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) she gets .",
    "since 8 different results can be encoded as a three - bit classical information , alice achieves , after receiving two qubits and conducting a single measurement , in obtaining three bits of classical information which is partially provided by bob and partially by claire .",
    "this procedure might have interesting use in quantum communication , _",
    "e.g. _ if alice , who has previously let two others help her keep some secret information separately , then wants to retrieve it in a safe way such that neither bob nor claire can know it .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning that when extended to arbitrary number of parties , alice can retrieve @xmath7-bit information always by a single measurement after receiving @xmath8 qubits from @xmath8 senders .",
    "in our physical model , the atomic hyperfine levels are encoded as qubits . and due to the magnetic field gradient , the ions can be distinguished in frequency space and individually addressed by microwaves . for pedagogical reasons",
    ", our calculations will start from the case of three ions beside each other linearly confined in three individual traps , based on the multi - trap model in ref.@xcite .",
    "the three ions , for example @xmath9 , are in a magnetic field with gradient in @xmath10 direction , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "if we encode qubits as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the hamiltonian for this system can be written as : @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the transition frequency for ion @xmath16 which depends on the equilibrium position @xmath17 of the ion in the magnetic field gradient , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the @xmath20 vibrational frequency and the usual pauli operator for ion @xmath16 , and @xmath21 is the expansion coefficient of the displacement of ion @xmath16 in terms of the normal mode coordinate . for simplicity",
    ", we have adjusted the coupling terms @xmath22 by simply setting the frequencies of microtrap for ion 1 and 3 to be equal .    .",
    "@xmath23 is the separation between neighboring traps.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    direct algebra calculation shows that the eigenenergies of the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) are as in table [ tab1 ] , which can be distinguished from each other . besides , we give the carrier transition frequency @xmath24 of a certain ion with corresponding states of the other two ions as in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "it is obviously that the carrier transition frequencies for each ion are dependent on the states of the other two ions @xcite .",
    ".the eigenenergies in the space spanned by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final step is to collectively measure all of the three ions to find out the encoded information . the 8 maximal entangled basis in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) are not easy to distinguish experimentally , but we can apply the following operations to change them into computational basis : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denote the encoded three - bit classical information .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] clearly depicts the whole procedure of our scheme in circuit model .",
    "alice conducts a single measurement at the output of the circuit and obtains the encoded information . till now , we have already shown how to implement all the operations needed in the our whole procedure .",
    "denotes the hadamard gate , @xmath35 and @xmath36 stand for the single - qubit unitary operations bob and claire perform on the qubits at their hands.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "it is necessary to give some brief discussions on the experimental feasibility of our scheme .",
    "compared with the cirac - zoller gate operation @xcite and the geometric phase gate operation @xcite , our scheme does not require moving or hiding any ions , which is important in view of decoherence @xcite .",
    "based on the table [ tab3 ] , we estimate the two - qubit cnot gate operation time to be 3 ms . as an example , we supposed 10% of the modes are really excited during our implementation of the gate , then our scheme would work as long as the heating times of the vibrational states are longer than 0.3 ms . which meets the requirement of current technology .",
    "besides , the microtrap in our consideration is of the size of 5@xmath37 , and experimentally , three ions in a linear trap with spacing of the order of @xmath37 has already been achieved @xcite . in addition , microwave with a certain bandwidth and a rapid change of phase is a perfect technique and magnetic field gradient up to 8000t / m is within the reach of current experiments @xcite . in - trap magnetic field gradient of 200",
    "t / m over several micrometers , which is used in our scheme , can be easily achieved through methods similar to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , as previously shown by wunderlich @xcite , the magnetic field gradient allows the qubits to be individually addressed in the microwave via zeeman splitting of the hyperfine structure , and the qubit readout process can be achieved through trapped ion fluorescence shelving techniques .",
    "we know that the fluorescence detecting measurement takes 250@xmath38 @xcite base on the parameters in table [ tab3 ] , [ tab4 ] , thus we can estimate that the whole quantum dense coding process takes less than 6ms .",
    "the implementation time can be further shortened by increasing the spin - spin coupling strength @xmath39 , which can be done by reducing the inter - trap spacing @xmath23 or enlarging the magnetic field gradient .    our scheme is implemented in linear ion traps , whereas it will also be practicable in multi - trap devices considering currently available techniques @xcite .",
    "thus our scheme can in principle be extended to qdc between arbitrary number of parties , as theoretically proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the maximal entangled state can still be prepared through hadamard and cnot gates , and the pauli operations each sender performs can be carried out using the same evolution operator as in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) . it is our hope that our scheme can guide future experiment for these qdc procedures , as well as stimulating further discourse on related qip techniques in real physical systems .",

    "<S> in contrast to the original ion trap scheme for qdc @xcite , we also make use of the microwave source instead of the raman - type radiation , which makes practical experiments easier than those using lasers . based on such physical model </S>",
