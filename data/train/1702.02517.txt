    "action potential propagation is a crucial phenomenon for information process in the nervous system and particularly in the brain .",
    "one of the most important models , which have been proposed to describe action potential propagation , is the hodgkin - huxley model . written initially in 1952 ,",

    "hodgkin and huxley used the new voltage clamp technique to maintain constant the membrane potential .",
    "this technique allowed them to elaborate and fit the functional parameters of their model of four odes with their experiments .",

    "our first aim is to provide a right mathematical framework for solutions of system .",
    "this is done in section 2 where we prove the global existence of solutions as well as the existence of invariant regions and the existence of an attractor",
    ". then in the third section we deal with numerical simulations for a single nonhomogeneous hh rd system and two coupled hh rd systems .",
