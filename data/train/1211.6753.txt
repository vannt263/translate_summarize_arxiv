    "the theory of cosmological inflation @xcite ( see als @xcite for related original work ) has become the current paradigm of early universe cosmology .",
    "not only does the scenario solve some of the conceptual problems of standard big bang cosmology , the previous paradigm of cosmology , but it provided @xcite the first explanation for the origin of the large - scale structure of the universe based on causal physics ( see also @xcite for related original work ) .",
    "better yet , inflationary cosmology was predictive .",
    "the scenario predicted an almost scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations which are coherent and passive on scales which in the early universe are larger than the hubble radius .",
    "as has been known since around 1970 @xcite , such a spectrum predicts characteristic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave ( cmb ) anisotropy maps , oscillations which were first discovered by the boomerang experiment @xcite and later confirmed with high accuracy by the wmap satellite experiment @xcite .",
    "inflationary cosmology is based on the assumption that there is a period in the very early universe during which space is expanding at an accelerated rate ( typically almost exponentially ) .",
    "figure 1 depicts a space - time sketch of inflationary cosmology .",
    "the vertical axis is time , the horizontal axis represents physical distance .",
    "the period of inflation begins at a time @xmath0 and ends at time @xmath1 .",
    "the accelerated expansion of space during this time interval can create a large and almost spatially flat universe from an initial state in which the size of space is microscopic . in this way",
    ", inflation solves the `` size problem '' of standard cosmology . in an accelerating universe the contribution of spatial curvature to the total density decreases .",
    "hence , a spatially flat universe is a local attractor in initial condition space @xcite , thus providing a solution to the `` flatness problem '' .    in figure",
    "1 three distance scales are shown .",
    "the solid curve which corresponds to an almost constant value during the period of inflation is the _ hubble radius _",
    "@xmath2 which is given by the inverse expansion rate of space .",
    "the hubble radius plays an important role in the evolution of cosmological perturbations , the inhomogeneities which give rise to the large - scale structure of the universe and which lead to cmb anisotropies . on length scales smaller than the hubble radius ,",
    "matter fluctuations oscillate almost like in flat space - time .",
    "these fluctuations freeze out when the wavelength crosses the hubble radius . on larger scales ,",
    "the evolution of the perturbations is governed by gravity .",
    "the dashed curve which tracks the hubble radius before the onset of inflation but whose length grows exponentially during the period of inflation is the _ horizon _ , the forward light cone from a point at the time of the big bang .",
    "the horizon is the largest distance that causal information can travel .",
    "the fact that the horizon becomes exponentially larger than the hubble radius provides a solution to the `` horizon ( or homogeneity ) problem '' of standard cosmology : in the context of inflation , the causal horizon can be much larger that any scale which we observe today . in particular this can explain the near isotropy of the cmb .",
    "the third length scale shown in figure 1 , the curve labelled by @xmath3 , represents the physical length of a fluctuation mode .",
    "the fact that modes well inside the hubble radius at early times become exponentially larger than the hubble radius by the end of the period of inflation provides a causal mechanism by which fluctuations are generated in inflationary cosmology . since classical matter redshifts exponentially during the period of inflation",
    ", it is natural to assume that matter approaches the vacuum state .",
    "the vacuum , however , is permeated by quantum vacuum perturbations , and hence it was conjectured @xcite that the primordial fluctuations are quantum mechanical in nature . the theory of structure formation in inflationary cosmology is based on the quantum theory of cosmological perturbations @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for in - depth reviews , and @xcite for a pedagogical overview ) . based on the above discussion",
    "it is reasonable to assume that fluctuations begin in their quantum vacuum state @xcite . while on sub - hubble scales , the fluctuation modes undergo quantum vacuum oscillations .",
    "they freeze out once the wavelength of the mode becomes larger than the hubble radius .",
    "thereafter the modes are squeezed while on super - hubble scales .",
    "in particular , all modes acquire the same angle in phase space .",
    "they hence enter the hubble radius at late times as standing waves , leading to the characteristic acoustic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies which were mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "based on the time - translation symmetry of the inflationary phase , it is expected @xcite that the spectrum of the density perturbations produced during inflation is approximately scale - invariant , and the mathematical analysis confirms this result .",
    "is the physical length of a fixed comoving fluctuation scale .",
    "the role of the hubble radius and the horizon are discussed in the text.,height=340 ]    the causal generation mechanism of fluctuations described above is the most significant success of inflationary cosmology . however , a second look at the space - time sketch of fig .",
    "1 reveals a serious conceptual problem @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently long period of inflation is required in order for modes which are currently probed in cosmological observations to have a wavelength smaller than the hubble radius at the beginning of the period of inflation - which is a necessary condition for the validity of the inflationary structure formation scenario . however",
    ", if the period of inflation is only slightly longer ( 70 e - foldings in models in which the energy scale at which inflation takes place is close to the scale of grand unification ) , then the wavelengths of all fluctuation modes which are currently inside the hubble radius were smaller than the planck length at the beginning of the period of inflation .",
    "we do not understand physics on length scales smaller than the planck length .",
    "the problem for inflationary cosmology is that fluctuation modes emerge from this sub - planck - wavelength zone of ignorance , as is sketched in fig .",
    "2 . new physics is required to truly understand the origin and early evolution of the fluctuations .",
    "( majenta vertical line ) .",
    "the symbols have the same meaning as in figure 1 .",
    "note , specifically , that - as long as the period of inflation lasts a couple of e - foldings longer than the minimal value required for inflation to address the problems of standard big bang cosmology - all wavelengths of cosmological interest to us today start out at the beginning of the period of inflation with a wavelength which is smaller than the planck length.,height=340 ]    based on the geometry of figure 2 , there are good reasons to expect that planck - scale physics can lead to a modification of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations : if we imagine starting off all perturbation modes on a fixed space - like cauchy surface at the beginning of the period of inflation , then short distance modes will feel the effects of the modified physics for a longer time than long wavelength modes .",
    "if the evolution of the modes is not adiabatic on short wavelength scales , then one would expect the spectrum for short wavelength modes to be boosted relative to that of long wavelength modes .",
    "this would produce a blue tilt in the spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the above problem is now called the _ trans - planckian problem _ for inflationary cosmology .",
    "while it may be a problem from the point of view of inflationary theory , it can instead to viewed as a _ trans - planckian window of opportunity _ to probe planck - scale physics with current cosmological observations",
    ". the accelerated expansion of space brings scales into the observable range which we have no chance of probing in accelerator physics .    in the following sections",
    ", we will review these trans - planckian issues for inflationary cosmology . in section 2",
    "we discuss some theoretical approaches , beginning with a brief review of some of the original approaches to studying the sensitivity of the predictions of inflationary cosmology to assumptions about trans - planckian physics .",
    "we continue with a discussion of two more recent realizations of inflation in the context of specific models of trans - planckian physics . in one case",
    "we find dramatic differences compared to the `` standard results '' , in the second case we recover the usual spectrum .",
    "we end section 2 with some general remarks . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss observational constraints on the magnitude of trans - planckian effects in inflationary cosmology .",
    "finally , in section 5 we attempt to draw connections with some broader issues .",
    "the original work on the trans - planckian problem for inflation was performed in the context of _ modified dispersion relations _ , @xcite for the linear fluctuation modes , following works @xcite which studied the dependence of black hole radiation on planck scale physics .",
    "this method represents a toy model to study the unkown effects of trans - planckian physics , a method which has the practical advantage of remaining within the context of applicability of linear cosmological perturbation theory . before introducing the basics of the method",
    ", we must remind the reader of the relevant formalism .",
    "we are interested in following the _ scalar metric perturbations _ , the linearized gravitational fluctuation modes induced by matter perturbations . in the context of general relativity ,",
    "the relevant canonical variable ( the mukhanov - sasaki variable @xcite ) @xmath4 satisfies the following fourier space equation of motion @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath3 denotes the comoving momentum and a prime stands for the derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath6 .",
    "the function @xmath7 depends on the background cosmology . if the equation of state of the background is time - independent , then @xmath7 is proportional to the scale factor @xmath8 .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is related to the curvature fluctuation @xmath9 in comoving gauge , a coordinate system in which the matter fluctuation vanishes , via @xmath10 .",
    "the variable @xmath9 carries vanishing mass dimension .    of particular interest",
    "is the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath11 defined via [ for a more accurate definition , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ngps ] ) ] [ eq : defpsintro ] p_(k ) ~ k^3 |_k|^2",
    ". the power spectrum is called  scale - invariant \" if @xmath11 is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the idea of the modified dispersion relation method is to introduce a non - trivial relation between the physical frequency and momentum of the modes [ moddisp ] k^2 k_eff^2(k , ) a^2 ( ) _ phys^2 , where the function @xmath12 deviates from its usual form @xmath13 only in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . as will be discussed below",
    ", such dispersion relations arise from specific theories of planck - scale physics such as hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "the modification of the dispersion relation implies a change in the hamiltonian of the perturbation modes which has important effects at short wavelengths .",
    "the analysis of  @xcite is based on the following assumptions : first , we consider a space - like hypersurface on which we set up initial conditions .",
    "second , the initial conditions are chosen to represent the lowest energy state of the local hamiltonian at the initial time . since this hamiltonian will deviate from the usual one on short wavelength scales , the initial state will deviate from the usual bunch - davies vacuum of the un - modified theory , the deviations increasing towards the ultraviolet .    for mild distortions of the dispersion relation such as those considered in @xcite where @xmath14 asymptotes to a constant in the ultraviolet",
    ", the evolution of the mode functions will be adiabatic ( they are the wkb solutions ) and track the local vacuum state . in this case",
    ", the evolution will lead to the usual scale - invariant spectrum at late times .    on the other hand , if the dispersion relation violates the adiabaticity condition [ adcond ] - < 1 then an initial vacuum state will evolve to a state which on large scales differs from the bunch - davies vacuum of the unmodified theory .",
    "the deviations increase as the frequency increases , thus leading to a steep blue spectrum in violation of the observational constraints ( see sections 3 and 4 ) .",
    "deviations from adiabaticity arise for one branch of the modified dispersion relations proposed in @xcite . specifically , one can consider the example @xcite [ modexample ] _ phys^2 = k_phys^2 - 2 b_1 k_phys^4 + b_2 k_phys^6 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being two positive constants . in the case of this dispersion relation ( sketched in fig .",
    "7 ) there can be a region of values of @xmath17 for which the adiabaticity condition is violated . in this example",
    ", adiabaticity is maintained both in the far ultraviolet and the infrared .    while we do not expect concrete models of modified physics on trans - planckian scales to yield dispersion relations which are adiabatic in the far uv , assuming that this takes place in our toy model makes it easy to justify our initial conditions",
    ": we can start modes in the adiabatic vacuum in the far uv .",
    "as the universe expands , the physical wavenumber will redshift .",
    "modes which begin in the far uv adiabatic regime will experience a time interval of finite duration during which the wavenumber is in the non - adiabatic region .",
    "hence , the wavefunction will obtain corrections from its wkb form .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of the final fluctuations will change @xcite .    to a first approximation ( in the deviation of the expansion of space from exponential ) ,",
    "the shape of the spectrum will not change since all modes spend the same amount of time in the region of non - adiabaticity ( as discussed in section 3 , there will be superimposed oscillations in the spectrum ) .",
    "however , in models in which non - adiabaticty is violated at all uv scales ( like the ones considered in @xcite ) , short wavelength modes spend more time in the region of non - adiabaticity , and hence the spectrum of cosmological perturbations will acquire a blue tilt whose spectral slope can well exceed current limits .",
    "a more conservative approach to the trans - planckian problem is simply not to evolve the fluctuation modes during the time period in which their wavelength is smaller than the length scale of the new physics .",
    "this corresponds to introducing a time - like _ new physics hypersurface _ on which initial conditions are imposed .",
    "we expect the wavelength at which the new physics hypersurface is reached to be given by the planck length ( or the string length - in the context of string cosmology - if it is larger ) .    at this point , the trans - planckian problem has simply been shifted to the problem of choosing initial conditions on the new physics hypersurface .",
    "the most conservative approach is to start modes off in their local adiabatic vacuum .",
    "note , however , that precisely the main point of the analysis of the previous subsection is that new physics acting on trans - planckian scales can well produce states which are very different from the local adiabatic vacuum at the time when the wavelength equals the new physics scale .    even continuing with the conservative approach",
    "mentioned above , a careful tracking of the mode wavefunctions reveals residual oscillations in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations depends on whether we are computing the spectrum of test scalar fields on a fixed background metric , gravitational waves , or scalar metric fluctuations .",
    "in the two former cases the amplitude of the oscillations in the power spectrum is _",
    "gw ~ o(1 ) ( ) ^2 , where @xmath18 is the mass scale of the new physics hypersurface , and in the case of scalar cosmological perturbations we have _",
    "_ s ~ o(1 ) .",
    "note that within the _ new physics hypersurface approach _ , the setting of the initial state is not unique . whereas the prescription adopted by @xcite leads to oscillations of the abovementioned magnitude , the choice made by @xcite and studied in more detail in @xcite leads to oscillations with amplitude suppressed by three powers of @xmath19 .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude of the trans - planckian effects on the definition of the `` local vacuum state '' was explored in detail in @xcite .    in the context of the choice of the vacuum state for cosmological perturbations",
    "there has been some discussion about vacuum states which are alternatives to the usual bunch - davies @xcite vacuum .",
    "these are the _",
    "@xmath20 vacua _",
    "@xcite discussed in the context of cosmological perturbations in @xcite .",
    "they are in different superselection sectors of states than the bunch - davies vacuum , and applied to inflationary cosmology they also lead to oscillations in the power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "the use of such vacua has , however , been criticized on the basis of their instabilities @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "our view , however , is that in the context of inflationary cosmology which is not past eternal @xcite , it makes more sense to restrict attention to states which are in the same superselection sector as the usual vacuum , and which can hence be generated from such a vacuum by local trans - planckian physics .      in the two previous subsections we discussed two general frameworks for studying trans - planckian effects on the spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "another general framework is the _ effective field theory _ approach .",
    "the idea of effective field theory is to integrate out the high energy physics and to derive an effective lagrangian which only involves observable scales .",
    "the application of effective field theory techniques to the trans - planckian problem of inflation was pioneered in @xcite and @xcite . however , the expansion of space ( in particular the fact that planck - scale modes are redshifted into the visible sector ) leads to challenges which are not present in usual applications of effective field theory , challenges which were not taken into account in @xcite , where it was claimed that trans - planckian effects on the spectrum of cosmological perturbations can not be larger than @xmath21 . however , as shown e.g. in the work of @xcite , even in the context of effective field theory and local lorentz invariance it is possible for the pre - inflationary dynamics to produce states which deviate from the standard bunch - davies vacuum and for which hence the corrections to the power spectrum are larger .    some authors have considered general modifications of physics on planck scales such as _ modified uncertainty principles _",
    "@xcite , _ space - space non - commutativty _ @xcite and _ space - time non - commutativity _ @xcite and computed the changes in the spectrum of perturbations in an inflationary cosmology .",
    "all of these approaches can be viewed as leading to specific prescriptions of setting the intial conditions on a space - like new physics hypersurface .",
    "if we make the strong assumptions firstly that the microscopic structure of space - time on planck scales is lorentz invariant and secondly that the state of the system is in its local vacuum , then it indeed follows that the corrections to the spatial correlation function and hence to the power spectrum are bounded by @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "even if one accepts the first assumption , the second one is a very strong one . we know",
    "that ( in the context of einstein gravity with matter fields obeying the usual energy conditions ) inflation is singular in the past @xcite , and there is thus pre - inflationary dynamics which must be taken into account when determining what the initial state of the fluctuation modes is . in particular , perfectly lorentz - invariant theories can lead to a bouncing universe , e.g. through the addition of quintom matter @xcite or in the context of specific string theory backgrounds @xcite .        in theories which admit",
    "non - singular bouncing cosmologies ( e.g. hoava - lifshitz gravity in the presence of non - vanishing spatial curvature @xcite ) , it is possible to have a post - bounce inflationary phase and , by time reflection symmetry , a contracting deflationary phase ( see figure 3 for the corresponding space - time diagram ) .",
    "the spectrum of cosmological perturbations was studied in this context in @xcite .",
    "is constant during the deflationary phase of contraction and during the inflationary phase of expansion .",
    "it diverges around the bounce point .",
    "the solid ( blue ) curve labelled @xmath3 indicates the wavelength of a fluctuation mode which exits the hubble radius in its bunch - davies vacuum state during the radiation phase of contraction at time @xmath22 , evolves on super - hubble scales until it enters the hubble radius at time @xmath23 during the deflationary phase .",
    "the time @xmath24 is the transition between radiation contraction and deflation .",
    ", height=340 ]    since the universe begins large and cold , it is natural to start with perturbations in their bunch - davies vacuum state . in a contracting universe",
    "the curvature fluctuation variable @xmath9 grows on super - hubble scales ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in a radiation phase of contraction",
    "the growth rate is proportional to @xmath25 ( the conformal time @xmath6 is increasing towards @xmath26 ) , and in the deflationary phase @xmath9 increases as @xmath27 ( @xmath6 is increasing to @xmath28 in this phase ) . in this process",
    ", the initial vacuum spectrum is transformed into a dimensionless spectrum which scales as [ spectrum ] p ~ k^-4 , where @xmath29 is the time when the scale @xmath3 enters the hubble radius during the deflationary phase .",
    "the evolution of the fluctuations between the time @xmath30 of hubble radius entry during the contracting phase and hubble radius exit at the time @xmath30 is symmetric .",
    "hence , the spectrum at hubble radius exit is the same as at hubble radius entrance .",
    "since @xmath9 is conserved on super - hubble scales in the expanding phase , the final spectrum of curvature fluctuations in the expanding phase is given by ( [ spectrum ] ) , i.e. it is an @xmath31 spectrum .",
    "this is a highly red spectrum compared to a scale - invariant one ( @xmath32 which is indicated by experiments ) .",
    "the redness of the spectrum is due to the extra growth which long wavelength modes undergo since they spend a longer time on super - hubble scales .    as will be discussed in the following section , a red spectrum is not only constrained by observations , but also by back - reaction .",
    "applied to our model , this implies that the bouncing model can not be symmetric about the bounce point .",
    "the phase of deflation must be short . as a consequence , one obtains a scale - invariant spectrum in the ultraviolet and a red spectrum in the infrared .",
    "this model is an example of how trans - planckian effects can lead to very large deviations from scale - invariance . as in most non - singular bouncing cosmologies",
    ", it requires specially tuned matter and initial condition modeling to obtain a scenario in which a period of deflation follows after a radiation phase .",
    "one way , as explored in the quintom matter bounce scenarios @xcite is to have the pre - bounce radiation come from a scalar field @xmath33 with quartic potential .",
    "while the scalar field is oscillating about its ground state , the time - averaged equation of state is that of radiation . in the contracting phase the amplitude of oscillations increases .",
    "but once the amplitude exceeds the planck scale , a deflationary slow - climb phase sets in .",
    "hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity is a four space - time - dimensional theory which has been proposed @xcite as a power - counting renormalizable theory of quantum gravity . in this theory ,",
    "the microscopic lagrangian is not locally lorentz - invariant .",
    "there is a distinguished time direction , and the gravitational lagrangian contains higher space - derivative terms . as a consequence , space - time diffeomorphism invariance is also lost .",
    "the theory is only invariant under the subgroup of spatial diffeomorphisms , and under separate space - independent time reparametrizations .",
    "the guiding principle of the construction of the lagrangian is invariance with respect to the residual symmetries and power - counting renormalizability with respect to an anisotropic scaling b x , t b^3 t , where @xmath34 is some constant .",
    "there are two versions of the theory - the _ projectable _ version in which the lapse function @xmath35 is a function of only time , and the _ non - projectable _ version in which @xmath35 can depend on space and time .",
    "renormalizability allows up to six - space - derivative terms in the equations of motion .",
    "hence , quite naturally a modified dispersion relation for fluctuation modes results .",
    "there is a second major difference in the theory of cosmological perturbations in hl gravity compared to einstein gravity : because of the reduced symmetry , there is an extra scalar gravitational fluctuation mode ( see e.g. @xcite for a review of hl gravity ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in the case of the projectable version of hl gravity the extra scalar mode is sick ( either ghost - like or tachyonic ) , while in the non - projectable version it can be @xcite well - behaved ( for suitable choices of the free parameters of the lagrangian ) .",
    "the extra mode in fact becomes massive in the infrared and thus only plays an important role in the ultraviolet .",
    "because of the existence of the extra degree of freedom and because of the modified dispersion relation one might expect that the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in inflationary cosmology in the context of hl gravity would lead to a very different spectrum of cosmological perturbations than in einstein gravity .",
    "however , a careful analysis of this issue @xcite has shown firstly that the evolution of the regular fluctuation mode is adiabatic and secondly that the fluctuations induced by the extra degree of freedom are sub - dominant .",
    "hence , up to oscillations in the spectrum whose frequency is too high to be observationally detectable , the spectrum of cosmological perturbations which emerges when starting all modes off at a fixed time in their instantaneous minimum energy state is scale invariant .",
    "this example indicates a certain degree of robustness of the standard predictions of inflation even if the underlying physics at the planck scale is substantially modified .",
    "it is interesting to ask to which extend the trans - planckian problem discussed here is specific to inflationary cosmology or what aspects of the problem arise in any cosmological background . to address this question ,",
    "let us introduce two paradigms alternative to inflation which can explain the observed almost scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "the first is the _ string gas cosmology _ model introduced as a background cosmology in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and shown to lead to a mechanism for producing an almost scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations in @xcite .",
    "the second is the _",
    "matter bounce _",
    "scenario of @xcite , a non - singular bouncing cosmology with an initial matter - dominated phase of contraction .",
    "_ string gas cosmology _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) is based on the realization that a gas of closed strings has a maximal temperature , the `` hagedorn temperature '' @xcite @xmath36 . at temperatures close to @xmath36 ,",
    "all of the modes of strings including winding modes are excited .",
    "this high temperature phase is called the `` hagedorn phase '' .",
    "it is then reasonable to assume that the universe begins in the hagedorn phase . since the temperature of a box of strings is independent of the radius @xmath37 of the box for a wide range of values of @xmath37 ( assuming that the entropy of the system is large ) , it is not unreasonable to assume that the hagedorn phase is quasi - static ( including fixed dilaton ) .",
    "eventually ( through the decay of string winding modes into string loops ) the universe transits into the radiation phase of standard cosmology .",
    "the time when this happens is called @xmath1 in analogy to the reheating time at the end of inflation . in the context of this string gas cosmology background , it was realized in @xcite that thermal string fluctuations in the hagedorn phase induce a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations at late times with a slight red tilt , and a scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves with a slight blue tilt @xcite - a key prediction of string gas cosmology with which it can be observationally distinguished from inflationary cosmology .     which shrinks abruptly to a micro - physical scale at @xmath1 and then increases linearly in time for @xmath38 . fixed co - moving scales ( the dotted lines labeled by @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) which are currently probed in cosmological observations have wavelengths which are smaller than the hubble radius before @xmath1 .",
    "they exit the hubble radius at times @xmath41 just prior to @xmath1 , and propagate with a wavelength larger than the hubble radius until they reenter the hubble radius at times @xmath42.,height=377 ]    figure 4 shows a space - time sketch of string gas cosmology .",
    "if the hagedorn temperature is taken to be similar to the post - inflation temperature ( which is typically comparable to the scale of grand unification ) , then the post - reheating evolution in inflationary cosmology is identical to the post - hagedorn dynamics in string gas cosmology .",
    "working backwards from the present time , it is not hard to see that the physical wavelengths of fluctuations which are observed today are many orders of magnitude larger than the planck scale at the time @xmath1 ( 1 mm is a typical value ) .    since in string",
    "gas cosmology scales which are observed now never had a wavelength close to the planck scale , the trans - planckian problem for cosmological perturbations is absent .",
    "the basic problems of quantum field theory in an expanding universe ( e.g. time - dependence of the hilbert space of fourier modes @xcite ) still are present , but they are not directly coupled to observations , unlike in inflationary cosmology where they are .    , the horizontal axis denotes a co - moving space coordinate . also , @xmath43 denotes the co - moving hubble radius.,height=340 ]    figure 5 represents a space - time sketch of a _",
    "matter bounce _ cosmology .",
    "the simplest way to visualize the background space - time is to take a mirror inverse of our expanding standard cosmology space - time ( which is a contracting universe which begins in a phase of matter - domination ) and match it to the expanding phases of standard cosmology via a short non - singular bounce phase ( see @xcite for a recent review of the matter bounce scenario ) .",
    "it goes without saying that new physics ( either in the matter or in the gravitational sector ) is required to obtain such a non - singular bounce .",
    "if the energy scale of the non - singular bounce is comparable to the scale of grand unification , then - as is the case in string gas cosmology - the physical wavelengths of scales which are currently probed in cosmological observations never enter the sub - planck length zone of ignorance , and hence there is no trans - planckian problem for cosmological perturbations .",
    "as first realized in @xcite , initial vacuum fluctuations which exit the hubble radius during the matter - dominated phase of contraction acquire a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations on super - hubble scales .",
    "the key point is that curvature perturbations in a contracting universe grow on super - hubble scales , and in a matter - dominated background the extra growth which long wavelength modes experience because they are super - hubble for a longer time is exactly the right amount to convert a blue vacuum spectrum into a scale - invariant one .",
    "one of the key predictions of the matter bounce scenario is that there is a cutoff scale set by the transition time between matter domination and radiation domination during the contracting period below which the spectrum of perturbations turns blue @xcite .",
    "in addition , the growth of the curvature fluctuation on super - hubble scales leads to a particular shape and reasonably large amplitude of the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "we have seen in the last sections that trans - planckian physics could modify the inflationary power spectrum .",
    "since we measure the inflationary power spectrum when we measure the cmb anisotropies , this opens the possibility to test these effects with astrophysical data . in order to carry out this program",
    ", we must first understand how to calculate the trans - planckian corrections . at this point",
    ", we meet a first difficulty .",
    "since the physics that controls the shape of these corrections is by definition unknown , it seems impossible to establish a generic result with regards to the shape of the modified power spectrum . here",
    "we will consider a conservative starting point , namely that the perturbations begin in the expanding phase in their instantaneous minimum energy state ( as we have seen before , this is not the most general case ) .",
    "we have seen before that , if trans - planckian physics is adiabatic , then the inflationary initial conditions are not modified .",
    "this means that the sub - hubble mukhanov - sasaki variable is still given by @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . if , however , the physical conditions that prevailed in the trans - planckian regime were non - adiabatic , then there was particle production and , as a result , @xmath47 .",
    "this immediately implies that the power spectrum ( which is proportional to the square modulus of @xmath48 ) contains super - imposed oscillations .",
    "therefore , even without knowing in detail the trans - planckian physics , it is possible to establish a generic prediction for the shape of the modified power spectrum .",

    "let us now comment on the power spectrum itself .",
    "we see it has the expected shape .",
    "there is the usual slow - roll ( almost scale - invariant ) part , with the overall normalization given by the square of the hubble parameter ( during inflation ) , measured in planck units , and divided by the first slow - roll parameter .",
    "this slow - roll part is corrected by two oscillatory terms which represent the super - imposed oscillations .",
    "it is interesting to notice that these oscillations are logarithmic in @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial conditions have been chosen on the surface @xmath85",
    "if , on the contrary , the initial conditions were chosen on a surface of constant time , then the oscillations would be linear .",
    "this is for instance what happens in bouncing models .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is , roughly speaking ( taking @xmath86 ) , given by @xmath87 while the frequency is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , if the initial state is the instantaneous minkowski vacuum , the amplitude is just inversely proportional to the frequency .",
    "this means that high frequency modes necessarily have a small amplitude .",
    "but , of course , there is a priori no reason to assume that the frequency and the amplitude are fully correlated .",
    "in addition , as we are going to see , postulating @xmath89 would prevent us to find the best fit .    on general grounds",
    ", we expect the ratio @xmath58 to be a small number . indeed , we know from the cobe normalization that @xmath90 .",

    ", we nevertheless meet another issue , namely the backreaction problem @xcite .",
    "if @xmath94 , we start from a non - vacuum state , a natural assumption if physics beyond the scale @xmath18 is non - adiabatic . but",
    "a non - vacuum state means that particles are initially present .",
    "since these particles carry energy density , there is now the danger that this energy density be comparable to or larger than that of the background , ( which is @xmath95 ) , in which case the energy in the particles would prevent the onset of inflation .",
    "clearly , the larger @xmath96 is , the larger the trans - planckian corrections become , and the more severe is the danger to have a backreaction problem .",
    "in fact , it is easy to estimate the regime where there is no backreaction problem .",
    "the energy density carried by the `` trans - planckian particles '' is @xmath97 therefore , the condition @xmath98 reduces to @xmath99 or , using the cobe normalization @xmath100 , @xmath101 as a consequence , one can have @xmath87 of order one and easily satisfy the above inequality ( in particular , in inflationary models where the gravity waves contribution is extremely small ) . of course",
    ", this does not mean that one should see trans - planckian effects in the cmb .",
    "it could very well turn out that @xmath102 is not large enough to compensate the smallness of the ratio @xmath58 . in that case ,",
    "the trans - planckian effects are there but it seems difficult to imagine how the small oscillations could be measured one day .",
    "another remark is in order here . in the above calculation ,",
    "we have used the value of the hubble parameter during inflation . as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if instead one had used its present day value , the no - backreaction condition would have become almost impossible to satisfy .",
    "using the hubble parameter during inflation assumes that the trans - planckian production of particles stops after the end of inflation .",
    "it is easy to find a situation where this happens .",
    "let us for instance consider the case where the trans - planckian corrections arise from a modified dispersion relation ( see the previous sections ) .",
    "a typical situation is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ( the model and the argument presented here were also studied in ref .",
    "the dispersion relation is almost linear for @xmath103 as it should be for obvious phenomenological reasons , and deviates from linearity for @xmath104 . in the regimes where @xmath105 , the adiabatic approximation is violated and particle production takes place .",
    "this is of course the case in the regime @xmath106 during inflation , this situation corresponding to the case where the wavelength of a fourier mode is larger than the hubble radius .",
    "but , as can be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , it is also the case when @xmath107 $ ] during inflation . in this regime ,",
    "adiabaticity is violated and the resulting inflationary power spectrum is modified ( and , typically , as argued before , acquires super - imposed oscillations ) .",
    "but the hubble parameter evolves ( decreases ) during inflation and after . as a consequence ,",
    "the horizontal red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] representing @xmath58 goes down in this diagram . at some point",
    ", it passes below the minimum of the dispersion relation and particle production stops . in particular",
    ", this is the case for the line representing the current hubble parameter . in such a situation ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath108 ( and not @xmath109 ) should be used in order to evaluate @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , we want @xmath111 because the energy density of the `` trans - planckian particles '' could spoil inflation .",
    "but , of course , this rests on the prejudice that the corresponding equation of state is different from @xmath112 , typically that of radiation @xmath113 . when the dispersion relation is modified , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the equation of state also acquires corrections . and , as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of the dispersion relation in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , the modified equation of state is precisely very close to that of the vacuum .",
    "therefore , even if one has a backreaction problem , it is not obvious that this will prevent inflation to proceed .        before turning to the observational constraints , it is also interesting to study how the oscillations in the power spectrum are transferred to the multipole moments . in principle , this calculation can only been done numerically .",
    "there is , however , a regime where one can obtain an approximate analytical result . for small @xmath114 ( that is to say large angular scales ) , in the limit @xmath115 and for @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) , the multipole moments can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath118\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 is the distance to the last scattering surface .",
    "the first conclusion that can be drawn from the above equation is that super - imposed oscillations in @xmath3-space are indeed transferred to the @xmath120-space , as the presence of the trigonometric function shows .",
    "this type of feature is not wiped out by the transfer function because the oscillations are present everywhere in @xmath3-space .",
    "moreover , we see that logarithmic oscillations in @xmath3-space give rise to linear oscillations in real space since the argument of the cosine function scales as @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , this last property turns out the be an artefact of the approximations used here .",
    "since we are in a situation where the frequency of the oscillations in momentum space goes to infinity , one finds oscillations in @xmath120-space with frequency @xmath122 which is just the maximum frequency possible given that the values of @xmath120 are discrete .",
    "finally , the amplitude of these oscillations is damped by a factor @xmath123 for very small @xmath120 , this effect being compensated by @xmath124 for larger @xmath120 .",
    "however , since the above formula breaks down in the latter regime , it is difficult to reach definite conclusions .",
    "one can nevertheless say that we expect the super - imposed oscillations to be absent at very large scales and to appear only at relatively small scales .",
    "these considerations are confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tplcl ] where multipole moments obtained from a trans - planckian power spectrum have been displayed . in particular , we see that the super - imposed oscillations only appear at the rise of the first peak but are damped at very large scales .",
    "having studied how the trans - planckian effects affect the cmb anisotropy , let us now turn to the question of their possible detection in astrophysical data .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the observational constraints on trans - planckian physics .",
    "it is conventional to assert that quantum gravity can be probed by studying the propagation of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "however , this is not the only astrophysical method which allows us to constrain trans - planckian effects .",
    "this can also been done with the help of the cmb anisotropies that have been precisely measured by the wmap satellite  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wmap ] ) . here , we briefly review the main techniques that have been used to address this question  @xcite ( for related works in the context of inflation without trans - planckian effects , see refs .",
    "the exploration of the parameter space corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerspectrum ] ) is usually done using monte carlo techniques .",
    "each model is computed using a modified version of the camb code  @xcite and the likelihood is estimated using the cosmomc code  @xcite .",
    "a first problem met in this kind of analysis is that , in presence of super - imposed oscillations , the calculation of one set of multipole moments @xmath125 becomes very time consuming ( a few minutes instead of a few seconds ) .",
    "as a consequence , it is not possible to explore the full parameter space and the analysis must be restricted to the `` fast parameter space '' .",
    "this means that the bare cosmological parameters are fixed to their best fit values and that the monte carlo exploration is only performed on the `` primordial parameters '' , namely the overall normalization of the spectra , the slow - roll parameters and the parameters describing the oscillations .",
    "the parameters describing the super - imposed oscillations are the amplitude , the frequency and the phase .",
    "the parameter describing the amplitude is , as discussed above , @xmath87 and it is convenient to take a uniform prior on this parameter in the range @xmath126 $ ] . in order to sample the frequency",
    ", one can choose a uniform prior in @xmath127 $ ] for the parameter @xmath128 .",
    "there is no need to emphasize again the important role played by the fact that @xmath94 .",
    "taking @xmath93 is not only poorly theoretically justified but , from the data analysis point of view , would render the amplitude and the frequency completely degenerate , a property that can affect a lot the result of the monte carlo exploration .",
    "finally , the phase is described by the parameter @xmath129 and one assumes a uniform prior in @xmath130 $ ] .",
    "the converged posteriors , marginalised posteriors ( solid black line ) and mean likelihood ( purple shaded bars ) , for the amplitude , frequency and the phase , have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : post1d ] given the seven years wmap data  @xcite .",
    "the marginalised posterior is a quantity which is sensitive not only to the absolute value of the likelihood function but also to the volume occupied in parameter space .",
    "therefore , if a set of parameters leads to a very good fit but is such that it requires a precise fine - tuning of those parameters ( that is say , if one slightly detunes the parameters , then the likelihood dramatically drops ) , then its marginalized probability can be small .",
    "on the other hand , the mean likelihood , as its name indicates , is only sensitive to the absolute value of the likelihood function and is independent of volume effects in the parameter space which is being considered .",
    "let us now describe the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : post1d ] .",
    "the amplitude of the marginalised probability is peaked over a vanishing value which indicates that the vanilla slow - roll power spectrum ( with no trans - planckian oscillations ) is still the favored model from a bayesian point of view .",
    "one finds that @xmath131 at @xmath132 confidence level .",
    "it is , however , also interesting to remark that , as opposed to the marginalised probability , the mean likelihood is peaked over a non - vanishing value .",
    "this means that the best fit is actually a model with trans - planckian oscillations .",
    "one finds that @xmath133 compared to the vanilla slow - roll model .",
    "the discrepency between the marginalized probability and the mean likelihood is interpreted , in agreement with the above discussion , as an indication that volume effects play an important role . in other words , if one goes away from the best fit model , the likelihood function quickly decreases which means that the best fit only occupies a small volume in parameter space .",
    "this analysis is confirmed by the frequency posteriors which exhibit a series of peaks at particular frequencies .",
    "the fact that those peaks are very narrow indicates that it is necessary to fine tune the frequency parameter in order to find the best fit , which is totally consistent with the fact that the best fit model occupies a small volume and , hence , that the marginalised and mean likelihood posteriors differ .",
    "let us add that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that , if the data actually contain super - imposed oscillations , then the likelihood function should precisely exhibit an oscillatory structure similar to the one which seems to emerge from the present analysis ( this structure is even more clearly visible on the 3d representation of the posteriors plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : post3d ] ) .",
    "this is an intriguing fact .",
    "finally , the frequency remains basically unconstrained although @xmath134 seems slightly favoured but , in any case , not in a statiscally significant way .",
    "we have emphasized previously that the trans - planckian effects lead to super - imposed oscillations that are logarithmic in @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to test whether this particular scale dependence is favored by the data .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the wmap3 data .",
    "the idea is to postulate the following power spectrum @xmath135+\\psi\\right\\}\\right),\\ ] ] such that , in the limit @xmath136 , one recovers logarithmic oscillations . assuming a uniform prior on @xmath137 in the range @xmath138 $ ]",
    ", one obtains at @xmath132 confidence level that @xmath139 . in this sense",
    ", one can indeed argue that the logarithmic structure is special .",
    "the above discussion should however be toned down given the fact that the best fit suffers from a severe backreaction problem .",
    "indeed , the best fit is obtained for the following values : @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( of course , this last result does not imply a detection of primordial gravitational waves since we only explore the fast parameter space , see the discussion before ) .",
    "these numbers imply that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the ratio @xmath58 has a very natural value and that it was indeed very useful to perform the analysis without the assumption @xmath93 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : backreaction ] ) now reads @xmath145 and the best fit clearly violates this inequality by three or four orders of magnitude .",
    "of course , this does not invalidate the statistical analysis presented here , it just questions the interpretation of the best fit in terms of super - imposed trans - planckian oscillations .",
    "so , in conclusion , what is the observational status of the trans - planckian oscillations ?",
    "clearly , the best model remains the slow - roll vanilla model and there is no detection , at a statistically significant level , of super - imposed oscilations . the bayesian evidence for this model has never been computed ( it was computed for the first time for different slow - roll models only recently in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but it seems pretty clear that its estimation would only reinforce this conclusion .",
    "moreover , we do not see any clear trend towards a detection as more and more accurate data set are released .",
    "indeed , for the first year wmap data , we had @xmath146 , for the three year wmap data we obtained @xmath147 , which is a `` better '' result , but the result was @xmath148 for the seven year data .",
    "there are , however , a list of intriguing hints ( the best fit is given by a model with super - imposed oscillations , presence of narrow peaks in the likelihood function ) that seems to indicate that , maybe , non trivial features are actually present in the data .",
    "of course , if this is the case , it remains to be seen whether there are of primordial origin and whether they can be explained by trans - planckian physics .",
    "but we are of the opinion that these hints are a sufficient motivation to carry out the analysis again when the planck data become available .",
    "let us now study how trans - planckian effects can modify the conventional predictions for non - gaussianities .",
    "as is now well - established , the level of non - gaussianity is small in single field inflationary models ( with a canonical kinetic term ) if the initial state is the bunch - davies state . roughly speaking , as shown for the first time in refs .",
    "@xcite and then further elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath149 parameter ( see the definition below ) is of the order of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "this level is too small to be detected even with the planck satellite ( the expected level of detection is @xmath150 ) .",
    "we have seen , however , that trans - planckian physics , if non - adiabatic , can place the cosmological perturbations in a non - vacuum state for which the above - mentioned result no longer holds .",
    "it is therefore interesting to estimate the level of non gaussianities if trans - planckian effects are present in the early universe .",
    "the first calculation in this direction was performed in refs .",
    "it was done for a non - vacuum state with a `` preferred direction '' in momentum space such that the three - point correlation function does not vanish even in the free theory . in this case",
    ", the level of non - gaussianity was found to be extremely small and beyond the level of detectability .",
    "we are , however , more interested in computing the non - gaussianity for a state characterized by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) and  ( [ eq : beta ] ) which generically describe the trans - planckian modifications . in this case",
    ", the free theory is still gaussian and , therefore , the corresponding three - point correlation vanishes .",
    "it is only when interactions are taken into account ( that is to say beyond the gaussian approximation ) that non - gaussianity can be produced .",
    "this problem has recently been considered by various authors , see refs .",
    "@xcite , and , in the following , we turn to this question .",
    "a gaussian distribution has a vanishing three - point correlation function and any detection of a non - vanishing signal would therefore rule out gaussian perturbations .",

    "let us recall that the curvature perturbation @xmath153 is related to the mukhanov - sasaki variable @xmath4 introduced before by @xmath155 . in the framework of the theory of cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin , it is an operator and it can be written as @xmath156.\\ ] ] since one has @xmath157 , the power spectrum can be expressed as [ see also eq .",

    "this means that we neglect the corrections due to the slow - roll parameters in the mode function ( but we took them into account when we computed the power spectrum ) .",

    "according to these references this could lead to an observable @xmath149 which , therefore , could constrain trans - planckian physics .",
    "let us now return to some more general issues related to trans - planckian physics in cosmology .",
    "the trans - planckian problem for cosmological perturbations is related to basic challenges to the applicability of effective field theory in an expanding background .    in free quantum field theory ,",
    "the starting point is canonical quantization of the fields . in an expanding background ( see @xcite for an overview of quantum field theory in curved space - times ) , the basic modes which are quantized are the plane wave modes which have constant wavelength in comoving coordinates and whose physical wavelength is hence increasing . even in minkowski space - time , quantum field theory requires regularization and renormalization in order to obtain finite answers for observables . in the context of gravity ,",
    "pure quantum field theory must break down on wavelengths smaller than the planck scale since waves with such large wavelengths would trigger the collapse of the background space - time into a gas of black holes .",
    "this problem is intimately related to the cosmological constant problem which arises when considering quantum field theory in gravity .",
    "hence , in the presence of gravity , the ultraviolet cutoff is not just a computational tool , but it as an issue with definite physical significance .",
    "the problem in an expanding background is that the ultraviolet cutoff is expected to correspond to a fixed scale in physical coordinates , whereas the basic modes of a quantum field have constant comoving wavelength .",
    "thus , as already discussed in @xcite , a fixed physical uv cutoff implies that the hilbert space of the quantum field must be time - dependent .",
    "as the universe expands , more and more new modes are required to describe the physics .",
    "the above uv problem arises in any cosmological space - time .",
    "what is special to inflationary cosmology ( as opposed to the alternatives which we have mentioned in section 2 ) is that these new modes are inflated to a wavelength which at the current time is observable .    for massless fields , there are also infrared ( ir ) divergences . since gravitational waves are massless , potential infrared divergences must be addressed in cosmology .    in cosmology",
    ", there is a natural scale which separates uv and ir modes - the hubble scale @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the expansion rate of space at time @xmath237 . on sub - hubble scales",
    "matter fluctuations oscillate as they do in flat space - time .",
    "however , on super - hubble scales the oscillations are frozen out and plane wave fluctuation modes become standing waves whose amplitude evolves in time as determined by the gravitational background . furthermore , a local observer ( local in space and time ) has a range of view limited by the hubble radius .",
    "hence , the hubble radius determines the separation between uv and ir modes .",
    "the increasing physical wavelength of the basic modes of a quantum field also leads to an infrared problem : in the case of an accelerating universe such as in inflationary cosmology , the phase space of infrared modes increases . even in the alternatives to inflation which were mentioned in section 2",
    "this problem arises .",
    "in fact , the increase of the phase space of infrared modes is a necessary condition to have a causal theory of structure formation since we need to make sure that scales which are being observed in cosmology today ( and which were in the infrared sea , i.e. had a wavelength greater than the hubble radius for most of the late time universe ) start out with a wavelength which is sub - hubble . in inflationary cosmology , the phase space of infrared modes increases during the inflationary phase , in string gas cosmology it grows at the end of the hagedorn phase , and in a bouncing cosmology it grows during the contracting phase .",
    "infrared divergences can be `` cured '' by imposing an infrared cutoff .",
    "such an infared cutoff can be well justfied on physical grounds : it corresponds to setting to zero the contribution of modes which are super - hubble at the initial time , and whose values would depend on dynamics before that time . in an expanding universe , this cutoff must be fixed in comoving coordinates , in contrast to the uv cutoff which is fixed in physical coordinates ( for a discussion of this point see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the phase space of ir modes is increasing relative to the phase space of uv modes , the magnitude of the infrared effects will be time - dependent .",
    "a possible consequence of this will be discussed in the following subsection .    as mentioned above",
    ", the growth of the sea of ir modes occurs in any causal theory of structure formation .",
    "what is special in inflationary cosmology is that the sea becomes populated by modes which initially were on trans - planckian scales .",
    "thus , in inflationary cosmology the trans - planckian problem for cosmological fluctuations and the infrared issues become coupled , which they are not in string gas cosmology or in a matter bounce scenario .    the effects of infrared modes on the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in inflationary cosmology",
    "has been studied recently in a large number of works @xcite .",
    "a first point to consider is that the effects of ir modes is different in an inflationary universe ( a cosmology with a finite duration de sitter phase ) compared to what happens in exact de sitter space .",
    "as recently studied in @xcite , the functional form of the ir terms is different in the two cases , the extra terms arising in an inflationary universe being multiplied by  slow - roll parameters \" of inflationary dynamics .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite and later discussed in depth in @xcite , it is crucial to measure the effects in terms of a physical clock as opposed to in terms of a background quantity which itself obtains corrections from the fluctuations . in the case of purely adiabatic fluctuations , it turns out that the effects of ir modes are not physically measurable @xcite . on the other hand , there are effects of ir modes of entropy fluctuations which are physically measurable @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have discussed infrared effects on cosmological fluctuations .",
    "what about infrared effects on the background ?",
    "from the point of view of cosmological perturbations , in the same way that a mode with wavenumber @xmath238 can combine with a mode with wavenumber @xmath239 to cause a second order correction to the mode with wavenumber @xmath3 , modes with wavenumbers @xmath3 and @xmath240 lead to a second order correction to the cosmological background .",

    "the back - reaction effect of scalar metric fluctuations in the de sitter phase of an inflationary cosmology was investigated ( see @xcite for a review of this method ) .",

    "there are terms quadratic in the linear metric fluctuations which we move to the right - hand side of the equations of motion to define an _ effective energy - momentum tensor _",
    "@xmath246 for cosmological perturbations ( see also @xcite where this method was first developed , albeit in a different context ) .",

    "the effective energy - momentum tensor @xmath246 obtains contributions from perturbations of all wavelengths .",

    "we begin with a large bare @xmath175 ( in the presence of matter ) .",

    "since at that time the acceleration of space ceases and the infrared sea ceases to grow .",

    "thus , the back - reaction of long wavelength cosmological perturbations has the potential of providing a dynamical relaxation mechanism for a large bare cosmological constant which explains dark energy and has no coincidence problem .",
    "note that the above mechanism is not in conflict with causality since only modes are considered which are inside the horizon .",
    "the effect can be locally described in terms of a time - dependent change in the spatial curvature constant @xmath3 and @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the key concern is that the above calculations have been performed as a function of a background time @xmath237 .",
    "as conjectured in @xcite and verified in @xcite , in the case of purely adiabatic fluctuations ( the energy densities of all components of matter being proportional ) the leading ir back - reaction effect discussed above can be entirely absorbed by a second order time - reparametrization .",

    "we have seen that the exponential expansion of space during the expanding branch of de sitter space - time , and consequently also during an inflationary phase of an expanding frwl universe , leads to important trans - planckian issues . in particular ,",
    "fluctuation modes which are being probed in current cosmological observations originate with wavelengths smaller than the planck length at the onset of the phase of exponential expansion .",

    "possibly the most important point is that due to the accelerated increase in the wavelength of scales , trans - planckian physics can in fact be tested with current cosmological observations .",
    "we have seen that under the assumption that at some initial time all modes are in their local vacuum state , then oscillations in the spectrum of cmb anisotropies are induced .",
