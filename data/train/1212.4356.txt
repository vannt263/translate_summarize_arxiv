    "the investigation of heavy flavour ( charm or bottom ) production in proton - proton collisions at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) are important for testing perturbative qcd calculations in a new energy domain , where very small bjorken-@xmath1 momentum fractions are expected to be probed .",
    "the detection of the heavy hadrons containing charm or bottom quarks can be done in several ways , either through their non - leptonic weak decays or through their semileptonical decays , where electrons or muons are measured inclusively .    already at the rhic ( relativistic heavy ion collider )",
    ", the phenix and star collaboration @xcite measured the production of muons and electrons from heavy flavour decays in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath3 tev .",
    "these data have been compared with perturbative qcd calculations in the fonll framework @xcite and were found in agreement with the measurements within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "experimentally the measurement of the semileptonic cross sections suffers from a large background due to the semileptonic decay of primary light hadrons including pions and kaons ( the main contribution ) and other meson and baryon decays ( such as @xmath4 and low mass resonances @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , from secondary leptons produced from secondary light hadron decays , and from secondary hadrons escaping from material surrounding the tracking chambers .",
    "all these backgrounds must be subtracted based on monte carlo simulations using the usual event generators to obtain the semileptonic yield due to the decay of heavy hadrons .",
    "the measured cross sections for the inclusive production of leptons from heavy hadron decays are of two types . in two experiments",
    "the production cross section is measured separately for solely @xmath7-hadron decays @xcite . in the cms experiment @xcite the @xmath7-hadron cross section",
    "was discriminated by measuring the muon transverse momentum with respect to the closest jet . in the alice experiment",
    "@xcite the production cross section of electrons , @xmath8 from semileptonic bottom hadron decays was selected by using the information on the distance of the secondary decay vertex with respect to the primary vertex . due to their long lifetime bottom hadrons decay at a secondary vertex displaced in space from the primary collision vertex . in all other measurements of the semileptonic production which were presented by the atlas @xcite and alice @xcite",
    "collaborations no attempt was made to separate leptons from charm and bottom hadrons .",
    "therefore these cross sections constitute the sum of lepton ( electrons or muons ) production cross sections of all charmed hadrons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10-baryons ) and all bottom hadrons ( @xmath11 and @xmath7-baryons ) .    at lhc energies the cross sections of charm and bottom production using special non - leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons",
    "have been reported .",
    "so , alice @xcite , atlas @xcite and lhcb @xcite presented cross section data on @xmath12 and @xmath13 production and cms @xcite published measurements for @xmath14 and @xmath15 production cross sections .",
    "all these cross sections have been calculated in the framework of the general - mass - variable - flavour - number - scheme ( gm - vfns ) @xcite , which has been developed in the last ten years for various processes . in this scheme we calculated the inclusive b meson production cross section in @xmath16 collision @xcite at @xmath17 tev and in @xmath2 collisions @xcite and found good agreement with the respective data from the cdf run ii @xcite and also with the data from the cms collaboration @xcite at the lhc at @xmath18 tev . besides the data based on special non - leptonic decays of b mesons mentioned above there exist also several cross section measurements for @xmath19 and @xmath20 followed by the inclusive decays @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these cross sections have been calculated recently also in the gm - vfns @xcite and compared with experimental data from cdf @xcite , cms @xcite , lhcb @xcite , atlas @xcite and alice @xcite collaborations at the lhc .",
    "the agreement between the calculated cross sections and the data was satisfactory .",
    "in the same scheme the inclusive production of charmed mesons @xmath23 and the charmed baryon @xmath24 has been calculated and the results for the alice @xcite , atlas @xcite and lhcb @xcite kinematic conditions have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and compared to the experimental data in the respective presentations of the alice @xcite , atlas @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations and for the alice data also in @xcite .",
    "the gm - vfns is similar to the zero - mass variable - flavour - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) , in which the heavy quark mass @xmath25 is neglected in the calculation of the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the predictions in the zm - vfns are expected to be reliable only in the region of very large values of the transverse momentum @xmath26 of the produced heavy hadron since terms of the order of @xmath27 are neglected in the hard - scattering cross sections . in the gm - vfns",
    "these @xmath27 terms are retained as they appear in the so - called fixed - flavour - number scheme ( ffns ) in such a way that by applying appropriate subtractions to the ffns the gm - vfns approaches the zm - vfns with the usual @xmath28 prescription in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "whereas in the ffns the gluon and the light partons are the only active partons in the initial state and the heavy quark appears only in the final state , produced in the hard - scattering process of light partons , in the gm - vfns as in the zm - vfns , due to the subtraction of the mass - singular contributions in the initial and final state , the heavy quark appears also in the initial state , and for the final state appropriate fragmentation functions ( ffs ) for the transition @xmath30 must be introduced which absorb the collinear singular contributions in the final state .",
    "such ffs for the transitions @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath24 have been extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite at nlo in the @xmath28 factorization scheme with @xmath35 ( for @xmath7 ) and with @xmath36 ( for @xmath10 ) flavours , consistently within the gm - vfn framework using data for the scaled energy ( @xmath1 ) distribution @xmath37 of @xmath38 and @xmath39 etc , respectively , measured by the cern lep1 , slac slc , cesr cleo and the kekb belle collaborations .",
    "the content of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we summarize our input choices of pdfs and b- and d - meson ffs . in this section",
    "we also explain how the fragmentation of these mesons into leptons has been calculated . in sec .",
    "3 we compare the predictions of the gm - vfn scheme with the existing data from the recent lhc run at @xmath40 tev @xcite and @xmath41 tev @xcite .",
    "we end with a summary in sec .",
    "the theoretical framework and results of the gm - vfn approach for @xmath16 ( @xmath2 ) collisions have been previously represented in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we describe our choice of input for the numerical analysis for inclusive lepton ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) production from charm and bottom hadrons .",
    "we use for the ingoing protons the pdf set cteq 6.6 @xcite as implemented in the lhapdf @xcite library .",
    "this pdf set was obtained in the framework of a general - mass scheme using the input mass values @xmath44 gev , and @xmath45 gev , and for the qcd coupling @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath10-and @xmath7-quark pdfs have the starting scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the nonperturbative ffs for the transition of @xmath31 were obtained by a fit to @xmath49 annihilation data from the aleph   @xcite , opal @xcite and sld @xcite collaborations and have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the combined fit to the three data sets was performed using the nlo scale parameter @xmath50 mev corresponding to @xmath51 adopted from ref .",
    "consistent with the chosen pdfs , the starting scale of the @xmath31 ff was assumed to be @xmath48 , while the @xmath52 ffs , where @xmath53 denotes the light quarks including the charm quark , were taken to vanish at @xmath54 . as input we used the ffs with a simple power ansatz which gave the best fit to the experimental data .",
    "the data from opal and sld included all @xmath7-hadron final states , i.e. all @xmath55 mesons , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath7-baryons while in the aleph analysis only final states with identified @xmath56 ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath60 ) were taken into account . for the fit in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the ffs of all @xmath7-hadrons have the same shape .",
    "this will also be assumed in this calculation .",
    "in addition we assumed that all @xmath7-hadrons have the same branching fractions and decay distributions into leptons as one of the @xmath55 mesons , @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "the only difference results from the different fractions @xmath61 , which are taken from the particle data group @xcite . based on these values the prediction , for example for @xmath57 , is multiplied by 2.49 , corresponding to leptons coming from @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "the bottom mass in the hard scattering cross sections is @xmath45 gev as it is used in the pdf cteq6.6 and in the ffs for @xmath31 etc .    for the transitions",
    "@xmath62 we employ the ffs determined in @xcite .",
    "they are based on fits to the most precise data on d meson production from the cleo collaboration at cesr @xcite and from the belle collaboration at kekb @xcite .",
    "actually there are several alternative fits presented in @xcite . here",
    "we use the so - called global - gm fit , which includes fitting in addition to opal data @xcite together with the cleo and belle results .",
    "the fits in @xcite are based on the charm mass @xmath63 gev , which is slightly larger than the one used in the cteq6.6 pdf fits .",
    "the starting scale for @xmath64 is @xmath47 as it is for the @xmath65 ffs , whereas for the @xmath66 ff it is @xmath48 .",
    "the subtractions related to renormalization and to the factorization of initial- and final- state singularities require the introduction of scale parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we choose the scales to be of order @xmath70 , where @xmath70 is the transverse mass @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the case of bottom quark production and @xmath73 for charm quark production .",
    "for exploiting the freedom in the choice of scales we introduce the scale parameters @xmath74 ( i = r , i , f ) by setting @xmath75 . to describe the theoretical uncertainties we vary the values of @xmath74 independently by factors of two up and down while keeping any ratio of the @xmath74 parameters smaller than or equal to two .",
    "the uncertainties due to scale variation are the dominating source of theoretical uncertainties . therefore pdf related uncertainties and variations of the bottom and charm mass are not considered .",

    "respectively @xmath84 , rest system , we calculated the lepton spectra @xmath136 in the moving system as function of @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) where @xmath95 is the lepton momentum that is parallel to @xmath96(@xmath139 ) using eq.(3.17 ) in @xcite .    to simplify the calculation we applied for @xmath136 the asymptotic formula as given in @xcite , which is the approximation for @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , where @xmath142 ans @xmath143 are the masses of the @xmath55 and @xmath84 meson , respectively .",

    "we would have based this normalization factor on @xmath126 production , the normalization factor would be slightly different .",
    "this difference is compensated by the different normalization of @xmath151 and the different lepton branching ratio , which result in almost equal cross sections @xmath147 for the production of leptons from charmed hadrons via @xmath127 or @xmath126 .",
