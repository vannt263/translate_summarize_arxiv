    "magnetoconductance ( mc ) of very small conductors , e.g. , quantum dots , wires , and rings , is a topic of intense research since the early days of mesoscopic physics . in the simple case of phase - coherent conductors topologically identical to the ring",
    ", one can generally distinguish between two classes of mc oscillations , differing in frequency by the factor of @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , the conductance oscillates with a period of @xmath1 in magnetic flux ( aharonov - bohm effect ) , since the magnetic field through the loop can be removed by a gauge transformation in integer multiples of the flux quantum @xmath1 .",
    "these oscillations are sensitive to the disorder distribution , however , so that averaging over various disorder configurations in nominally identical conductors , or self - averaging in larger samples , reduces the strength of the oscillations .",
    "the quantum weak - localization ( or antilocalization ) correction with a period of @xmath2 survives the averaging in diffusive samples.@xcite depending on the concentration of the disorder in a given sample , either @xmath1- or @xmath2-type oscillations can be more pronounced .",
    "a given realization of the disordered phase - coherent mesoscopic conductor , such as an open quantum dot or quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire , also exhibits universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) with amplitude @xmath3 , which vanish on sample averaging.@xcite the weak - localization correction related to @xmath2 mc oscillations in rings is usually manifested as a smooth background with the superimposed aperiodic ucf oscillations .",
    "all of the aforementioned phenomena can play a role in a quasi-1d wire with a finite cross section penetrated by a magnetic field . while a significant volume of the existing literature is devoted to the mc studies of disordered wires ( see , e.g. , refs .   and ) , the interference effects in magnetotransport of the quasiballistic nanowires did not attract the same attention ( see , however , refs .   for a discussion of weak - localization effects in narrow two - dimensional wires , which are ballistic across the wire width ) .",
    "recent advances in nanofabrication techniques , however , make it possible to experimentally probe the mc of nearly ballistic semiconducting nanowires,@xcite raising questions about the conductance oscillations related to the finite separation of the leads .",
    "see also ref .  , where ballistic carbon nanotubes were used to build a fabry - prot electron resonator , and refs .",
    ", reporting an observation and theory of the interference effects in tunneling between parallel ballistic quantum wires through a finite - length barrier .    in this paper , we are studying theoretically the magnetotransport in single quasiballistic nanowires .",
    "suppose the wire carries more than one quantum channel , so that the electron propagation between the injecting and detecting leads can interfere giving rise to conductance oscillations in the magnetic field , which depend on the lead separation length .",
    "if the electron density is confined to a narrow surface layer and the zeeman energy is disregarded , the mc in the parallel magnetic field can be decomposed into harmonics with frequencies in multiples of @xmath1 approximately corresponding to relative winding numbers of various electron paths around the wire axis between the two leads .",
    "generally , different transverse modes will effectively have different cross sections for accumulating the longitudinal magnetic flux resulting in aperiodic interference patterns .",
    "the aperiodicity is further enhanced by zeeman energy and , furthermore , the spin degrees of freedom affect transport nontrivially due to the spin - orbit coupling . in addition , strong magnetic fields can have a significant effect on the one - dimensional band structure of a long wire , leading to van hove magnetofingerprints in the conductance .",
    "varying the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the wire axis gives an additional degree of freedom for probing electronic structure .",
    "for example , a large perpendicular field eventually leads to a formation of landau levels having a profound effect on the one - dimensional conductance .    among the principal practical questions are how the mc traces",
    "can be used to extract information about electronic states in the transverse direction ( such as th e total number of modes and charge distribution , e.g. , surface - confined or nearly uniform etc . ) and about various scattering mechanisms ( involving in general elastic , phase - relaxation , and spin - orbit processes ) . while giving comprehensive answers to these questions",
    "lies beyond the scope of this paper , our analysis can be used to consider them in some simple scenarios as well as to lay the grounds for more systematic studies .",
    "this work was motivated , in large part , by magnetoconductance studies@xcite of cylindrical conducting nanowires,@xcite which provide a fascinating medium for mesoscopic physics@xcite as well as show a great promise for applications as building blocks of nanowire networks.@xcite after a general theoretical discussion in sec .
