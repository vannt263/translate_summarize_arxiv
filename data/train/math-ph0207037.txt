    "a one - sided infinite sequence @xmath1 over the alphabet @xmath2 is called a ( classical ) _ kolakoski sequence _ ( named after w.  kolakoski who introduced it in 1965 , see  @xcite ) , if it equals the sequence defined by its run lengths , e.g. : @xmath3 here , a _ run _ is a maximal subword consisting of identical letters .",
    "the sequence @xmath4 is the only other sequence which has this property .",
    "one way to obtain @xmath1 of ( [ eq : kol ] ) is by starting with @xmath5 as a seed and iterating the two substitutions @xmath6 alternatingly , i.e. , @xmath7 substitutes letters on even positions and @xmath8 letters on odd positions ( we begin counting at @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 clearly , the iterates converge to the kolakoski sequence @xmath1 ( in the obvious product topology ) , and @xmath1 is the unique ( one - sided ) fixed point of this iteration",
    ".    one can generalize this by choosing a different alphabet @xmath11 ( we are only looking at alphabets with @xmath12 ) .",
    "such a ( generalized ) kolakoski sequence , which is also equal to the sequence of its run lengths , can be obtained by iterating the two substitutions @xmath13 alternatingly . here , the starting letter of the sequence is @xmath14 .",
    "we will call such a sequence a kolakoski-@xmath15 sequence , or kol@xmath15 for short .",
    "the classical kolakoski sequence @xmath1 of ( [ eq : kol ] ) is therefore denoted by kol@xmath16 ( and @xmath17 by kol@xmath18 ) .",
    "while little is known about the classical kolakoski sequence ( see  @xcite ) , and the same holds for all kol@xmath15 with @xmath14 odd and @xmath19 even or vice versa ( see  @xcite ) , the situation is more favorable if @xmath14 and @xmath19 are either both even or both odd . if both are odd , one can , in some cases , rewrite the substitution as a substitution of pisot type ( see  @xcite ) , which can be described as ( limit ) aperiodic model sets . by this method ,",
    "kol@xmath20 is studied in  @xcite and shown to be a deformed model set .",
    "the case where both symbols are even will be studied below .",
    "it is the aim of this article to determine structure and order of the sequences kol@xmath21 .",
    "this will require two steps : first we establish an equivalent substitution of constant length for kol@xmath21 and analyze it with methods known from the theory of dynamical systems",
    ". then we conclude diffractive properties from this .",
    "remark : every kol@xmath15 can uniquely be extended to a bi - infinite ( or two - sided ) sequence .",
    "the one - sided sequence ( to the right ) is kol@xmath15 as explained above .",
    "the added part to the left is a reversed copy of kol@xmath22 , e.g. , in the case of the classical kolakoski sequence of ( [ eq : kol ] ) , this reads as @xmath23 where `` @xmath24 '' denotes the seamline between the one - sided sequences .",
    "note that , if @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) , the bi - infinite sequence is mirror symmetric around the first position to the left ( right ) of the seamline .",
    "the bi - infinite sequence equals the sequence of its run lengths , if counting is begun at the seamline .",
    "alternatively , one can get such a bi - infinite sequence by starting with @xmath27 and applying the two substitutions to get @xmath28 in the first step and so forth .",
    "this also implies that kol@xmath15 and kol@xmath22 will have the same spectral properties , and it suffices to study one of them .",
    "if both letters are even numbers , i.e. , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 , where we can concentrate on @xmath32 by the above discussion ) , one can build blocks of two letters and obtain an ( ordinary ) substitution . setting @xmath33 and @xmath34 , these substitutions and their _ substitution matrix _ @xmath35 ( sometimes called _ incidence matrix _ of the substitution )",
    "are given by @xmath36 where the entry @xmath37 is the number of occurrences of @xmath38 in @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ; sometimes the transposed matrix is used ) .",
    "a bi - infinite fixed point can be obtained as follows : @xmath41 this corresponds to the unique bi - infinite kol@xmath21 according to our above convention .",
    "a substitution @xmath42 is _ primitive _ if the corresponding substitution matrix @xmath35 is primitive , i.e. , @xmath43 has positive entries only for some @xmath44 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath42 is primitive if there exists a positive integer @xmath44 such that every @xmath45 occurs in @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "the vector @xmath48 with components @xmath49 , for @xmath45 , is called the _ length _ of the substitution @xmath42 .",
    "if all @xmath50 are equal , @xmath42 is a substitution of _ constant length_. for the substitution @xmath51 of  ( [ eq : subs1 ] ) , we have @xmath52 which is therefore not of constant length ( recall that @xmath53 ) .    we will also need some notions from the theory of _ dynamical systems _",

    "this is all that can occur by the chosen minimality of @xmath220 .",

    "this can be seen by the fact that we get kol@xmath21 from the one generated by @xmath51 of  ( [ eq : subs1 ] ) by the substitution @xmath352 , @xmath34 , which corresponds just to doubling each letter in the latter one ( see the substitution matrices in  ( [ eq : subs1 ] ) and footnote  [ foo : note ] ) .    if we consider how to get from  ( [ eq : subs2 ] ) , respectively  ( [ eq : subs3 ] ) , to kol@xmath21 and compare this to proposition  [ prop : lm1 ] , we get ( compare with  ( [ eq : dynspec ] ) ) : kol@xmath21 , respectively @xmath353 , @xmath354 are model sets for @xmath355 where @xmath356 ( as before , @xmath357 , where @xmath124 are the distinct primes dividing @xmath95 . ) the diffraction spectrum calculated from this cut - and - project scheme is consistent with the previous one , since the fourier - bohr coefficients which arise in each @xmath358 separately are weighted by factors @xmath359 or @xmath360 which depend on the element of the cyclic group @xmath361 ( similar for the case @xmath362 ) , compare with  @xcite  but this is just how we calculated the @xmath339 s from @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "let us show how one calculates the diffraction spectrum of @xmath345 of  ( [ eq : kol42 ] ) explicitly .",
    "this substitution can be written in recursive equations for @xmath363 , @xmath364 and @xmath345 by observing at which position in which substitution a certain letter occurs ( e.g. , @xmath162 occurs in @xmath152 at positions @xmath77 and @xmath5 and in @xmath160 at position @xmath5)-adic space , because multiplication by a factor of @xmath99 is a contraction in the @xmath99-adic topology .",
    "the closure of the windows in the @xmath99-adic internal space is therefore given by the unique compact solution of this ifs by ( a generalized version of ) hutchinson s theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1(3 ) ) .",
    "this method is well known for unimodular substitutions of pisot - type , see  @xcite , @xcite and the vast literature about rauzy fractals .",
    "similar results apply for all primitive substitutions of constant length @xmath0 in @xmath0-adic space . ] : @xmath365 where @xmath366 .",
    "iterating these equations and using @xmath367 , one gets : @xmath368 the fourier transform of each lattice coset @xmath369 is easy to calculate : @xmath370 every fourier - bohr coefficients of @xmath371 are then given by the sum of the fourier - bohr coefficients of the corresponding @xmath372 .",
    "the structure of @xmath345 ( similar for all @xmath329 that occur for substitutions of constant length ) as a union of a countable but infinite set of ( periodic ) lattice cosets @xmath373 gives rise to the name _ limit - periodic _ , see  @xcite .",
    "the _ support _ of the bragg peaks of kol@xmath21 is given by @xmath374 where @xmath375 are the distinct primes dividing @xmath95 and @xmath376 is the cyclic group of  ( [ eq : cyclicgroup ] ) .",
    "however , there need not be a bragg peak on every point of the support , e.g. , kol@xmath377 is equivalent to a substitution @xmath138 of constant length @xmath378 , but the positions of a letter @xmath248 , @xmath379 are separated by multiples of @xmath5 : the support in this case is better described by @xmath380 than by @xmath381 .",
    "so far , we have talked in an `` abstract '' way about the @xmath0-adic internal space .",
    "usually the discussion ends at this point , but we want to `` visualize '' this @xmath0-adic space .",
    "we hope that by doing this , we also gain some intuition for such spaces and the meaning of @xmath14-adic internal spaces for model sets .",
    "recall that a @xmath14-adic integer can be written as a formal series @xmath382 with integral coefficients @xmath383 satisfying @xmath384 ( _ hensel expansion _ ) . for the following ,",
    "we identify a @xmath14-adic integer @xmath385 with the sequence @xmath386 of its coefficients .",
    "the set of all @xmath14-adic integers ( a ring ) is written as @xmath387 , while the field of @xmath14-adic numbers is written as @xmath388 and can be seen as the set of all laurent series @xmath389 with @xmath390 .",
    "there is a @xmath14-adic _ valuation _ @xmath391 defined by @xmath392 , which gives rise to the @xmath14-adic _ metric _ with @xmath393 and @xmath394 ( and @xmath388 and @xmath387 are the completions of @xmath395 and @xmath341 with respect to the @xmath14-adic metric ) .",
    "so with respect to the @xmath14-adic metric , two numbers in @xmath341 are close if their difference is divisible by a high power of @xmath14 . note that this is a _ non - archimedean _ absolute value ( i.e. , @xmath396 for all @xmath397 ) and we therefore get some `` strange '' properties : all triangles are isosceles , every point inside a ball @xmath398 is the center of this ball , all balls are open and closed , etc . , see  @xcite .    for euclidean models ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.2 ) ) of @xmath387 we only need to know the formal series @xmath399 .",
    "we can even show models for @xmath120 , where we do not make use of  ( [ eq : ladic ] ) .",
    "for this , we use the addressing scheme known for fractals , for example in the sierpinsky gasket , see  ( * ? ? ? * chapter iv . ) :    = 0.65    now the interesting thing here is that each point in the sierpinsky gasket has a unique address ( at least if we do not take the usual connected sierpinsky gasket but the totally disconnected version ; this can be obtained by using a contraction factor less than @xmath400 in the ifs for the sierpinsky gasket ) .",
    "so each point in the sierpinsky gasket corresponds to a sequence @xmath386 with elements @xmath401  this is just the hensel expansion of the @xmath99-adic integers .",
    "similarly , the cantor set is such a geometric encoding of the @xmath5-adic integers .",
    "`` reasonable '' geometric representations of @xmath120 in @xmath402 are those , where the sets @xmath403 of points starting with the same address are represented by objects of the same size for a fixed @xmath404 . therefore we get that in @xmath405-dimension , @xmath120 with @xmath406 can reasonably be represented , if we do not make use of  ( [ eq : ladic ] ) .",
    "note that we can represent @xmath407 either in @xmath408 or @xmath409 .",
    "this geometric representation surely fails for some @xmath14-adic ( or @xmath0-adic ) properties ( all triangles are isosceles , every point inside a ball is its center , etc . ) , but some are also `` preserved '' : points which are close in the @xmath14-adic topology are also close in this geometric representation and the representation as totally disconnected fractal corresponds to the totally disconnected field @xmath388 , @xmath387 and its geometric models are both compact sets . and balls in the @xmath14-adic topology correspond to scaled down copies of the whole fractal .",
    "we like to conclude this section with our example from  ( [ eq : kol42 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath99-adic geometric models are given in figure  [ fig : kol42 ] .",
    "observe that , in the two - dimensional representation , the parts ( according to our above addressing scheme for the sierpinsky gasket ) @xmath410 , @xmath411 and @xmath412 are colored by only one color .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that at positions @xmath413 are @xmath150 s , on @xmath414 are @xmath415 s and on @xmath416 are @xmath162 s only in the bi - infinite sequence .",
    "so , large patches of the same color in the geometric representations correspond to lattice cosets @xmath417 with small @xmath418 .",
    "a similar addressing scheme can be used for the one - dimensional representation ( and in fact for all @xmath0-adic representations ) .",
