    "the understanding of the properties of small magnetic elements has been a major challenge in the rapidly evolving field of nanoscale science .",
    "besides the basic scientific interest in the magnetic properties of these systems , evidence is that they might be used in the production of magnetic devices , such as high density media for magnetic recording @xcite and magnetic logic @xcite .",
    "common structures are arrays of nanowires @xcite , cylinders @xcite , cones @xcite and rings @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies on such structures have been carried out aiming at determining the stable magnetized state as a function of their geometric details jubert , porrati , metlov , guslienko . among the available geometries ,",
    "the ring shape is of particular interest due to its core - free magnetic configuration leading to uniform switching fields , guaranteeing reproducibility in read - write processes @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "magnetic nanorings have received increasing attention over the last few years , from both experimental and theoretical points of view .",
    "geometrically , ring - shaped particles are characterized by their external and internal radii , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and height , @xmath2 .",
    "magnetic measurements as well as micromagnetic simulations of such systems have identified two in - plane magnetic states , namely the flux - closure vortex state , @xmath3 , and the so - called onionstate , @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is accessible from saturation and is characterized by the presence of two opposite head to head walls klaui1,castano1 .",
    "in addition , for sufficiently high values of @xmath2 , the occurrence of ferromagnetic order , @xmath5 , along the ring axis , is also possible .",
    "it is therefore clear that , for practical applications , the determination of the ranges of values of the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , within which one of those configurations is of lowest energy , is of great relevance .",
    "however , magnetic measurements do not always allow a clear identification of the magnetic arrangement within the particles , which makes the theoretical approach to the problem highly desirable .",
    "in the present work we report results of total energy calculations for magnetic nanorings , on the basis of which the relative stability of the three above mentioned configurations could be determined .",
    "our results are summarized by phase diagrams in the @xmath6 plane .",
    "nanorings in the size range currently produced may consist of more than @xmath7 magnetic atoms . as a consequence ,",
    "the determination of the configuration of lowest energy based on the investigation of the behavior of individual magnetic moments becomes numerically prohibitive . in order to circumvent this problem , we resort to a simplified description of the system , in which the discrete distribution of magnetic moments is replaced by a continuous one , characterized by the magnetization @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 gives the total magnetic moment within the element of volume @xmath10 centered at @xmath11 .",
    "we also require that @xmath12 , the saturation magnetization .",
    "the internal energy , @xmath13 , of a single ring is given by the sum of three terms corresponding to the magnetostatic ( @xmath14 ) , the exchange ( @xmath15 ) , and the anisotropy ( @xmath16 ) contributions .",
    "since nanorings are usually polycrystalline , the magnetic anisotropy averages to zero due to the random orientation of the crystallites @xcite . in view of that , it will be neglected in our calculations .",
    "the dipolar contribution can be obtained from the magnetization according to the relation    @xmath17    where an additional configuration independent term has been left out , and the magnetostatic potential is given ( in si units ) by    @xmath18    in the above expression , @xmath3 and @xmath19 represent the volume and surface of the ring , respectively .",
    "assuming that the magnetization varies slowly on the scale of the lattice parameter , the exchange energy can be written as    @xmath20 \\mbox{d}v\\,\\ , , \\label{x}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are the reduced components of the magnetization and @xmath23 is the stiffness constant of the material , which depends on the exchange interaction between the magnetic moments .",
    "also in this expression , an additional configuration independent term has been left out @xcite . at this point",
    "it is convenient to define dimensionless variables .",
    "the natural scale for linear dimensions is given by the exchange length , @xmath24 , in terms of which we can define the dimensionless radius and height @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it is also worth defining the parameter @xmath27 and the aspect ratio @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .    in order to proceed with our calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the function @xmath30 corresponding to each of the three configurations under consideration .",
    "for the ferromagnetic state , @xmath31 can be approximated by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the unit vector parallel to the axis of the ring , whereas for the vortex state we can take @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the azimuthal unit vector in the ring plane , @xmath36 .",
    "the most interesting case , however , regards the onion configuration , whose typical arrangement of the magnetic moments is illustrated in fig.(1 ) .",
    "so far , no analytical model has been presented in the literature to describe such configuration . however in a recent work , beleggia _ et al .",
    "_ beleggia have investigated the magnetic phase diagram for rings , considering a ferromagnetic - in - plane configuration instead of the onion configuration .    ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "the arrows denote the direction of the magnetization.,title=\"fig:\",width=188,height=188 ] [ f1 ]    the model we adopt is based on the assumption that the magnetization in the onion configuration can be approximated by    @xmath40    where the possible dependence of @xmath41 and of @xmath42 on @xmath43 has been neglected .",
    "the important point here is the implicit dependence of the two components of the magnetization on the geometry of the ring , more precisely , on the values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in order to be realistic , any model for the onion configuration has to allow the magnetization either to approach that of an in - plane ferromagnetic or to deviate from it , depending on the values of these parameters .",
    "this point will be made clearer further on in this article .",
    "taking into consideration the spacial symmetry of @xmath47 , as represented in fig.(1 ) , the expressions for the reduced components @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the magnetization can be written as    @xmath50    and    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a bounded function such that @xmath53 .",
    "a suitable form for the function @xmath52 is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a continuous variable , defined such that @xmath56 , chosen so as to minimize the total energy of the configuration for each value of @xmath57 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "such model allows a continuous transition from the in - plane ferromagnetic state ( @xmath58 ) to the onion state ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the deviation from the ferromagnetic configuration becomes more pronounced as @xmath55 increases from 1 .",
    "fig.(1 ) shows a possible onion configuration with @xmath59 .",
    "having specified the functional form of @xmath30 for the three configurations , we are now in position to evaluate the total energy for each of them .      from eq.([x ] ) we immediately find that @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the total energy has only the dipolar contribution , which can be obtained from the magnetostatic potential @xmath61 given by eq.([p ] ) . using the expansion ( [ green ] ) in expression ( [ p ] )",

    "it is clear from eq.([p ] ) that for this configuration @xmath66 .",
    "the exchange contribution can also be evaluated from eq.([x ] ) so that the final result for the reduced total energy reads @xmath67      in the previous two configurations , the magnetization function satisfies the condition @xmath68 , which means absence of volumetric magnetic charges . in the onion configuration , however , due to the presence of two regions with head - to - head domain walls , in which @xmath69 , the dipolar energy turns out to be given by the sum of two contributions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , coming from the surface and volume terms in the expression for @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "details of the calculations of these two quantities are given in the appendix .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath55 enters just via the functions @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "the functions @xmath91 can be calculated just once for given values of @xmath46 and @xmath92",

    "results are presented for rings both inside ( full symbols ) and outside ( open symbols ) the onion stability region .",
    "the latter correspond to either unstable or metastable onion configurations.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ] [ f3 ]    the transition between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 configurations is determined by the balance between the energies of the out - of - plane and of the in - plane magnetic configurations .",
    "a qualitative understanding of such transition can be achieved by examining the strength of the demagnetization fields along the @xmath111 and @xmath112 axes . for",
    "given @xmath46 and @xmath57 , larger values of @xmath45 result in reduced demagnetization fields along the @xmath111 direction , favoring the @xmath5 configuration .",
    "this is the case , for example , of rings with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , when @xmath45 is increased from 1.0 to 3.0 . on the other hand , for fixed @xmath57 and @xmath45 , a decrease in @xmath46",
    "is equivalent to a reduction of the inner radius , which results in a larger in plane demagnetizing field .",
    "thus , a ring with @xmath113 and @xmath115 exhibits an in - plane magnetic order for @xmath114 , and an out - of - plane order for @xmath116 .    concerning the two in - plane configurations , namely @xmath4 and @xmath3 , the transition between them depends on the strength of the demagnetization field along the @xmath112 direction in the domain wall regions of the @xmath4 configuration . the larger the value of the ring width @xmath117 , the smaller this field is , favoring the onion state",
    "thus , a ring with @xmath118 and @xmath119 exhibits the @xmath3 phase for @xmath116 , and the @xmath4 configuration for @xmath114 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the transition between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 configurations is somewhat subtle .",
    "we notice in fig.(2 ) that the line separating these two regions exhibits a maximum shift to the left for @xmath120 about 0.5 . as a consequence ,",
    "rings with say @xmath118 , @xmath121 and inner radius corresponding to @xmath122 0.2 , 0.5 , and 0.8 are found to exhibit @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 configurations , respectively .",
    "such interesting behavior can be understood by considering the relative strength of the exchange and dipolar energies in the two states .",
    "it is clear from eq.([ev ] ) that for fixed values of  @xmath57 and @xmath45 the exchange energy in the vortex state diverges at @xmath123 , whereas that for the @xmath5 configuration approaches a finite value [ cf .",
    "eqs([ef ] ) and ( [ fi ] ) ] .",
    "thus , for sufficiently small inner radii ( @xmath124 ) , the @xmath5 configuration has lower energy than the @xmath3 one .",
    "the reason for that is the large contribution to @xmath125 coming from the central region of the ring .",
    "then , the increase in the inner radius leads to a rapid decrease of @xmath126 , reducing @xmath127 with respect to @xmath128 and favoring the @xmath3 configuration for intermediate values of @xmath46 .",
    "however , for values of @xmath129 close to 1 ( narrow rings ) and sufficiently large values of @xmath45 , the dipolar energy in the @xmath5 state , which can be associated to the magnetic charges at the top and bottom surfaces of the ring , becomes smaller than @xmath125 , favoring the ferromagnetic state .    ) as a function of @xmath130 ( full circles ) .",
    "the result for a cylinder is represented by a star.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=188 ] [ f4 ]    all diagrams in fig.(2 ) show a triple point ( @xmath131 ) , corresponding to the situation in which the three configurations have equal energy .",
    "fig.(4 ) shows the trajectory of the triple point ( @xmath132 ) as a function of @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that the curve correctly extrapolates to the result for cylinders , which has been numerically obtained by dalbuquerque e castro _ et al . _ scaling1 using a scaling technique , and analytically , by landeros _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "an interesting result is the occurrence in some cases of metastable onion configurations .",

    ", they have found that the corresponding hysteresis curves clearly indicate the occurrence of metastable onion configurations .",
    "such states can be reached by reducing the applied magnetic field from the saturation value to zero . however , as the magnetic field is increased in the opposite direction and the magnetic energy becomes sufficiently high to overcome the energy barrier between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 configurations , the systems undergoes a transition to the latter state .",
    "such behavior is entirely consistent with our results .",
    "indeed , taking into consideration that for co @xmath141 nm , the rings examined by castao and collaborators have reduced dimensions @xmath142 , and @xmath143 and correspond to @xmath144 and 0.39 .",

    "the occurrence of metastable onion states within the vortex region has also been found in micromagnetic calculations . using the oommf package @xcite",
    "we have carried out ground state calculations for a co ring with @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "we have found that the system might be trapped in a metastable onion configuration when the in - plane ferromagnetic state is taken as the starting configuration .",
