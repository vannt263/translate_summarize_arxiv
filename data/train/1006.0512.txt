    "<S> we construct clusters of classical heisenberg spins with two spin @xmath0-type interactions for which the ground state manifold consists of disconnected pieces . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the construction to lattices and couplings for which the ground state manifold splits into an exponentially large number of disconnected pieces at a sharp point as the interaction strengths are varied with respect to each other . in one such lattice we construct , the number of disconnected pieces in the ground state manifold can be counted exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> classical heisenberg spins , ground state manifold    classical as well as quantum spin systems are of basic importance in condensed matter as well as molecular physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin systems with competing interactions give rise to fascinating phenomena like spin glasses @xcite,@xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> context , classical spin systems with hamiltonians of the form @xmath1 have been widely studied , various lattices being obtained by setting specific @xmath2 s to zero . in the case of single molecule magnets , there are a few spins in the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> if the value of a spin is high it behaves similar to a classical spin . in this context , clusters of few classical heisenberg spins with @xmath0-type interactions are of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the ground states of the system are important because they are indicative of the properties of the system at low temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> an important question that arises is whether the ground state manifold of such systems can have disconnected pieces in it or will it always be a single connected piece ? by disconnected pieces in the ground state manifold we mean that to go continuously from a state in one piece of the manifold to a state in a different piece of the manifold the system has to _ necessarily _ go to excited states in between . </S>",
    "<S> if the ground state manifold has disconnected pieces , its dynamics will be significantly different from what it would be otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> to give an example , a bistable system with two disconnected pieces in the ground state manifold may display the phenomenon of stochastic resonance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for the case where the vectors @xmath3 are discrete ising spins the state space itself is discrete . for xy - spins on a triangular lattice , </S>",
    "<S> interacting antiferromagnetically , the ground state manifold has two disconnected pieces corresponding to whether the spins on any given elementary triangle are arranged at @xmath4 to eachother in a clockwise or in an anticlockwise manner . for heisenberg spins with </S>",
    "<S> the most commonly studied interactions of two spin @xmath0-type it is not known whether the ground state manifold can have disconnected pieces or not .    in this article we construct clusters , and also translationally invariant lattices , with heisenberg spins placed on them , see figure 1 and 2 , such that for low values of the tuning parameter , @xmath5 , there is only one ground state manifold . </S>",
    "<S> however as @xmath5 is increased , at a sharp point , the ground state manifold of the cluster splits into two disconnected pieces while that of the lattices into an exponential number of pieces . </S>",
    "<S> these pieces of the ground state manifold continuously move apart as the tuning parameter is increased further . </S>",
    "<S> we then construct another lattice with similar properties but for which we can enumerate the number of disconnected pieces in the ground state manifold exactly .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 form an angle of @xmath7 with each other . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 rises above the plane of @xmath9 and @xmath6 forming an angle of @xmath7 with both of them . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 goes below the plane of @xmath9 and @xmath6 forming an angle of @xmath7 with both of them . ]     </S>",
    "<S> is tuned . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the cluster of figure 1 and the lattices of figure 2 have been formed out of piecing together triangles of the form shown in figure 3 , so we analyse the triangle of spins in figure 3 first .     </S>",
    "<S> subgraph between spins @xmath9 and @xmath6 and its ground state ]    for three heisenberg spins with two - spin @xmath0-type interactions , there always exists a ground state with all the three spins coplanar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the spins of figure 3 is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for any value of @xmath5 , in the ground state , the spin @xmath12 will point along the direction @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath14 the only minimum of energy is at @xmath15 while for @xmath16 the minimum occurs at @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for @xmath18 the spins are parallel to eachother in the ground state while for @xmath19 the spins @xmath9 and @xmath6 make an angle of @xmath20 and @xmath12 lies along their angle bisector . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath7 increases continuously to @xmath21 as x increases .    </S>",
    "<S> now consider what happens when such triangles are put together .    </S>",
    "<S> the six spin cluster shown in figure 1 , is made of three triangles of the type shown in figure 3 . for any value of @xmath5 the energy of the three triangles </S>",
    "<S> gets individually minimised when the three spins , @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath22 each make an angle of @xmath7 ( @xmath23 if @xmath18 , and @xmath17 if @xmath19 ) with respect to eachother and the rest of the three spins are at the respective angle bisectors . </S>",
    "<S> thus given the positions of @xmath9 and @xmath6 , making an angle of @xmath7 between them , there are two different ground states of the system as shown in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> these two states being of different chirality can not be rigidly rotated into eachother . </S>",
    "<S> to continuously deform one of them into the other one has to necessarily change the angles between the spins , which raises the energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus there are two disconnected pieces of the ground state manifold , obtained by the rigid rotation of each of these ground states .    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice on the left in figure 2 can be obtained by putting together six - spin clusters of figure 1 , joined at the spins @xmath12 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 while the lattice on the right in figure 2 can be obtained by joining at spins @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> arguing as above , it is easy to see that for @xmath18 there is a single connected ground state manifold . as we raise the value of @xmath5 , at @xmath29 , the ground state manifold splits into a number of disconnected pieces which is exponential in @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the total number of spins in the lattice . to see this , for instance , the lattice on the right in figure 2 is a decorated triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying triangular lattice is obviously tripartite with three sublattices , say a , b and c. let the spins of the sublattice a all point in the same direction and those of sublattice b all in another direction which makes an angle @xmath7 to those of a. then the @xmath31 spins of sublattice c can independently point in either of the two directions making an angle @xmath7 with a as well as b spins thus obtaining a ground state ( the rest of the spins point along the respective angle bisectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the number of pieces in the ground state manifold is atleast @xmath32 and , it can be easily seen , is less than @xmath33 , thus completing the proof . </S>",
    "<S> these pieces continuously move apart as @xmath5 is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe the construction of a lattice of _ edge _ sharing triangles for which we can count the number of disconnected pieces in the ground state manifold exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> take a three coordinated bethe lattice , or any of its connected subgraphs . with each vertex associate a triangle such that its three edges are respectively perpendicular to the three bonds coming out of the vertex , the triangles of two neighbouring vertices sharing the edge perpendicular to the bond joining them , with the corresponding vertices identified . </S>",
    "<S> an example is shown in figure 4 . </S>",
    "<S> now each edge of this new graph is itself taken to be an @xmath34-subgraph shown in figure 3 . for @xmath18 , there is only one connected ground state manifold . for @xmath19 , </S>",
    "<S> there are exactly @xmath35 disconnected pieces of the ground state manifold , @xmath36 being the number of vertices in the subgraph of the bethe lattice . to see this , pick any vertex in the original subgraph of the bethe lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the three spins on the elementary triangle around it can be arranged in two ways of different chirality at an angle of @xmath7 to each other ( the internal spins of the @xmath34 subgraphs get fixed uniquely ) . </S>",
    "<S> now move along the original subgraph of the bethe lattice one edge at a time . </S>",
    "<S> the spin at each new vertex of the elementary triangle thus encountered can be arranged in two ways of different chirality maintaining an angle @xmath7 with the two other spins of this elementary triangle , thus completing the proof .        </S>",
    "<S> let us further study the distribution of the various disconnected pieces of the ground state manifold of this lattice . </S>",
    "<S> if we change our choice of orientation of any spin , say @xmath9 , in the bulk of the lattice , all the spins from there to the boundary will have to be changed to get to a ground state , the possible states being the mirror images of the earlier states reflected in the plane of the two spins in whose plane @xmath9 has been reflected . </S>",
    "<S> however , only a few spins at the boundary need to be changed to go from one ground state to another .    to summarize , it is possible for classical heisenberg spins with two spin @xmath0-type interactions to have a ground state manifold which consists of disconnected pieces . </S>",
    "<S> few - spin clusters as well as translationally invariant lattices were constructed to demonstrate this . </S>",
    "<S> the lattices discussed show a sharp transition , as the interaction strengths are varied with respect to each other , from a phase in which the ground state manifold is connected and continuous , to a phase in which it has an exponential number of disconnected pieces in it . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous transition was also observed for the six - spin cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - half version of some of these lattice models is likely to show chiral spin liquid behavior . </S>"
