    "clusters of galaxies from low to high redshift provide a unique opportunity to trace back the evolution of galaxies in dense environments .",
    "detailed studies of elliptical galaxies in nearby and intermediate redshift clusters showed that their photometric properties are homogeneous and evolve only mildly with redshift at @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with the so - called ` passive evolution ' , namely the change of the photometric properties of elliptical galaxies by the aging of their stars only , with a formation epoch of at least @xmath9 gyr ago ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; ellis et al . 1997",
    "; dickinson 1997b ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1997 ) . on the other hand , some s0 and spiral galaxies seem to experience faster evolution ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1994 ; dressler and smail 1997 ) .",
    "it is clear that pushing these studies to higher redshifts should provide stronger constraints on the epoch of cluster galaxy formation .",
    "unfortunately , only a very limited number of clusters and cluster candidates are known beyond @xmath10 ( dickinson 1995 ; 1997b ) , and thus the identification of high - redshift clusters itself should be the next important step .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) observations are essential in identifying clusters of galaxies at z @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that old passively - evolving galaxies observed at high redshifts have very red optical - nir colors ( aragn - salamanca et al . 1993 ; dickinson 1995 ; yamada and arimoto 1995 ) , since their optical flux rapidly decreases as the 4000@xmath12  break shifts toward longer wavelengths .",
    "for example , a 3@xmath12gyr - old passively - evolving model galaxy observed at @xmath13 has @xmath14 which is redder than most galactic stars and most field galaxies .",
    "therefore by selecting objects with red optical - nir colors , the contrast between cluster and field galaxies will be very much enhanced if clusters are dominated by old galaxies .",
    "it has been known for some time that radio - loud agns ( both radio - galaxies and quasars ) are frequently located in cluster environments ( see , e.g. , yee & green 1987 ; ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "thus , targeted searches in the fields of high redshift radio - loud agn provide an efficient approach to the problem of finding the ( probably ) rare galaxy clusters at @xmath15 ( see dickinson 1997c for a review ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report the clustering of very red objects in the vicinity of a quasar at @xmath16 where some excess in the surface number density of galaxies had already been reported by hutchings et al .",
    "( 1993 ) based on their optical data .",
    "we obtained deeper @xmath17 and @xmath18 optical images and nir @xmath19-band data of the region and confirmed the clustering of galaxies near the quasar ; their optical - nir colors and magnitudes are consistent with bright cluster galaxies formed at higher redshift and observed at @xmath16 .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath20km@xmath12s@xmath21mpc@xmath22 and @xmath23 have been assumed .",
    "with the aim of identifying high redshift cluster galaxies with red optical - nir colors , we have targeted the field around the radio - loud mjy exists at ( @xmath24 ( gregory and condon 1991 ) , while the quasar locates at @xmath25 ( vron - cetty and vron 1996 ) .",
    "we estimate that the logarithmic radio - optical luminosity ratio of the quasar is @xmath26 .",
    "thus the 1335.8 + 2834  should be classified as radio - loud . in the recent vla first survey catalog ( white et al .",
    "1997 ) , where the typical positional error is less than @xmath27arcsec , there is a radio source at @xmath28 . ]",
    "quasar 1335.8@xmath02834 at @xmath29 .",
    "hutchings , crampton & persam ( 1993 ) found that the surface density of galaxies within @xmath30@xmath31  separation ( @xmath32mpc at @xmath16 ) from the quasar is three times larger than the average density of their control fields . using narrow - band images centered on the [ oii]@xmath33  line redshifted to @xmath1 , they also found several emission - line galaxies near the quasar , suggesting the excess density is associated with the quasar redshift .",
    "optical images were obtained with the isaac newton telescope at la palma on the 28th of february , 1995 .",
    "a tek @xmath34 ccd with a projected pixel size of @xmath35arcsec was used .",
    "the weather conditions were mostly photometric .",
    "total exposures of @xmath36sec in the @xmath17 band and @xmath37sec in the @xmath18 band were gathered , subdivided in @xmath38 or @xmath39sec sub - exposures .",
    "the fwhm sizes of the stars were typically 1.5 ( @xmath17 ) and 1.8 ( @xmath18 ) arcsec .",
    "the frames were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and median - stacked in the usual manner .",
    "the @xmath19-band images were obtained with the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope equipped with the quirc camera on the 29th of february , 1996 .",
    "the detector was the @xmath34 hgcdte array with a projected pixel size of @xmath40arcsec .",
    "since the field of view of this camera ( @xmath41arcmin@xmath42 ) is smaller than that of the optical ccd ( @xmath43arcmin@xmath42 ) , we covered only the field which contains the region where the surface density had been evaluated to be high from the optical data . in this letter , we concentrate mainly on the properties of the objects contained within the @xmath19-band field .",
    "the net exposure time of the @xmath19-band image is @xmath44sec , subdivided in many @xmath45sec dis - registered exposures .",
    "the fwhm size of the stellar images was @xmath46arcsec .",
    "flat - field frames were built using a running median of @xmath47 images in a time sequence .",
    "the flat - fielded images were then median - stacked and a constant sky value was subtracted .",
    "the data reduction was done with iraf .",
    "object detection was carried out using focas ( jarvis and tyson 1981 ) with a detection threshold of @xmath48 of the sky fluctuations per pixel .",
    "a minimum of @xmath49 connecting pixels above the threshold was required for detection .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standards in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands , and ukirt bright standards in @xmath19 were used for photometric calibration , yielding zero - point errors smaller than @xmath50mag .",
    "we measured the colors of the objects within a fixed aperture with a diameter of @xmath51arcsec , twice the fwhm seeing in the @xmath18 band image ( the worse case ) , after correcting the seeing differences among the images .",
    "the apphot task in the iraf was used for the photometry .",
    "total magnitudes were also estimated using template growth curves determined from 10 isolated galaxies in the field .",
    "the source detection is complete for objects brighter than 24.5 , 23.5 , and 20.0 magnitudes in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "these limits were estimated from the turn - off of the number counts in the ` field region ' ( western half of the @xmath19-band image ) , which avoids the region of the cluster candidate ( see ahead ) .",
    "the counts are consistent , within @xmath52 , with published field number counts ( e.g. , smail et al .",
    "1995 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "the internal photometric errors in the aperture magnitudes were evaluated using the photon count statistics and also by changing the sky regions in the local sky subtraction procedure .",
    "typical errors are @xmath53 mag in @xmath17 and @xmath54 mag in @xmath18 and @xmath19 at the completeness limits . the error in the @xmath19-band total magnitude ( used in the color - magnitude diagram below )",
    "is estimated to be @xmath55 mag at @xmath56mag , where the uncertainties in our growth - curve - fitting procedure have been taken into account .",
    "figure 1 shows the three - color image of the @xmath19-band field , and figure  2a shows the distribution of the objects detected in the @xmath19-band image . objects with different colors are shown as different symbols .",
    "an excess in the number density of faint objects near the quasar ( denoted by ` qso ' ) is seen .",
    "hutchings et al .",
    "( 1993 ) divided the image into cells and found a @xmath57 surface density excess in the number of objects in a @xmath58arcsec@xmath42 region centered on the quasar .",
    "we made a similar analysis on our @xmath17 and @xmath18 optical images and found the excess surface density in a similar region to be @xmath59 above the counts of the surrounding field .",
    "moreover , red objects are seen much more frequently in the eastern ( left ) half of the image near the quasar .",
    "the color of most objects in the western side of the field is @xmath60 ( see below ) .",
    "it is clear that objects with red optical - nir colors are responsible for most of the excess in the number density . since stars earlier than m3v have colors @xmath60 ( johnson 1966 ; bessell 1990 ) , most of these red objects are probably galaxies ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "an un - evolved elliptical galaxy ( the reddest case for a galaxy without extinction ) has @xmath61 at @xmath62 , thus these red objects are probably galaxies at higher redshifts .    a fairly bright galaxy near the quasar ( g1 in figures  1 and  2 ) has @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , which agree very well with the expectations for a brightest cluster galaxy at @xmath66 ( aragn - salamanca et al 1993 )",
    ". a closer look at the spatial distribution of the overdensity indicates that the contrast is maximised when g1 is taken as the center , instead of the quasar .",
    "figure  2b shows the surface - density - contrast profile , centered on g1 , of all the objects detected in the @xmath19 band as well as those with @xmath67 .",
    "the excess surface density of @xmath19-band detected objects in a 100 arcsec box centered on g1 is @xmath68 above the counts of the surrounding field , which is significantly above that found in the optical images .",
    "moreover , if we consider only the red objects , the contrast of the putative cluster is significantly enhanced to @xmath69 above the field counts , which clearly indicates that the use of optical - nir colors is a powerful technique to identify high - redshift clusters .    -0.02 cm    the size of the region with the excess density is @xmath70 arcmin in diameter , corresponding to @xmath71mpc at @xmath16 , which is consistent with that expected for a rich galaxy cluster .",
    "if we count all the galaxies with @xmath72 as cluster members , nearly 30 galaxies remain after correcting for field contamination in this color range .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the abell richness class  0 .",
    "this could be a lower - limit for the cluster richness since we have only counted the red objects as cluster members .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the richness is not possible without galaxy redshifts .",
    "figure 3 shows the @xmath73 vs @xmath19 color - magnitude diagram for the objects in the @xmath19-band field .",
    "we tentatively define the ` cluster region ' as the eastern half of the field , and show the objects in this area with filled circles .",
    "the color distributions in the two regions are very different .",
    "there are 37 galaxies with @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the eastern ` cluster region ' but only 6 such objects in the western ` field ' region . in the cluster region",
    ", there is a group of objects with similar colors and magnitudes , @xmath76 and @xmath77@xmath78mag .",
    "they are consistent with a homogeneous population of galaxies seen at a similar redshift , which suggests that the clustering is probably real .",
    "these objects have @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 color is very redshift - sensitive at @xmath81 due to the fact that the @xmath82  break is located near or just inside the @xmath18 band at this redshift .",
    "thus , the red @xmath80 colors strongly suggest that these objects are old galaxies at @xmath83 . for comparison , on figure  3 we also plot the model colors and magnitudes of passively - evolving elliptical galaxies calculated with the models introduced by kodama and arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "the model parameters are chosen so that the color - magnitude relation at @xmath4 ( interpreted as a mass - metallicity sequence ) agrees with that of the coma cluster ( bower et al .",
    "the color and luminosity evolution predicted by such models agrees very well with the observed one for cluster ellipticals ( see kodama and arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate the expected colors of passively - evolving model galaxies with @xmath84 and @xmath85 mag at @xmath4 , which are formed at @xmath86 ( @xmath87gyr at @xmath4 ) . tilted straight lines indicate the expected color - magnitude relation at different redshifts ( see caption ) .",
    "the colors of the reddest galaxies in the complete sample are consistent with passively - evolving old galaxies observed at @xmath5 .",
    "they define a ` red envelope ' as expected if they are the oldest cluster galaxies at this redshift , although a clear color - magnitude sequence is not seen .",
    "-0.02 cm    the color - magnitude diagram also reveals a significant fraction of objects with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . since their color distribution seems somewhat separated from the redder galaxies , it is possible that these objects belong to a different system at lower redshift ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "however , the sky distribution of these moderately red objects is similar to that of the reddest objects ( cf .",
    "figure  2a ) , so it is possible that they are in the same system . without redshifts , these to possibilities can not be discriminated .",
    "figure 4 shows the two - color diagram for the ` cluster ' ( west half ) and ` field ' ( east half ) galaxies .",
    "the solid line shows the colors of elliptical galaxies observed at various redshifts derived from the same models as in figure  3 , representing the expected locus of the reddest galaxies observed at any redshift in the absence of reddening .",
    "it is clear that the reddest galaxies in both @xmath73 and @xmath91 are compatible with being passively - evolving cluster ellipticals at @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", there is a number of galaxies with moderately red @xmath73 color ( @xmath92 ) and bluer @xmath91 colors .",
    "hutchings et al .",
    "( 1993 ) had also noticed the bimodal distribution of @xmath91 colors in the excess - density region , which is not seen in their control field .",
    "if they are cluster members , their bluer optical colors would suggest a certain amount of current or recent star forming activity .",
    "we have found significant clustering of galaxies with very red optical - nir colors near the radio - loud quasar 1335.8@xmath02834 at @xmath5 .",
    "the reddest objects ( @xmath93 ) are responsible for nearly half of the surface density excess , and their colors and magnitudes are consistent with those of passively - evolving old galaxies seen at @xmath94 . if they are at the quasar redshift , galaxy evolution models suggest that in the absence of reddening the reddest objects are already @xmath95@xmath96gyr old . the range of colors displayed by the galaxies can be readily explained by the presence of some field galaxies at a variety of redshifts and by cluster galaxies with a variety of star formation histories such as disk galaxies formed a few gyr before @xmath5 , or old galaxies with young bursts of star formation .",
    "redshifts and morphologies are needed to study the evolutionary properties of the galaxies in detail .",
    "other examples of clustering of red galaxies near a radio - loud object at comparable redshifts have been found by dickinson and his collaborators ( dickinson 1995 ; 1997a ) .",
    "they observed the fields of powerful radio galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts with a similar optical and nir imaging strategy .",
    "the cluster around 3c  324 is their most outstanding case .",
    "redshifts for a few hundred objects confirmed a cluster at @xmath97 associated with 3c  324 , although many interlopers in another group or cluster at @xmath98 were also found .",
    "a similar contamination by a group or cluster at a slightly different redshift can not be excluded in the case of 1335.8@xmath02834 without extensive redshift data .",
    "hintzen , romanishin & valdes ( 1991 ) have also found significant clustering of galaxies around @xmath99@xmath100 radio - loud quasars .",
    "the galaxies responsible for the excess they detected seemed to be more luminous in the observed @xmath17-band than present - day brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the galaxies responsible for the excess we have found in the field of 1335.8@xmath02834 do not seem to be over - luminous in the @xmath19-band . since the observed @xmath17-band samples ultraviolet light at these redshifts , evolutionary effects such as the presence of moderate amounts of young stars can boost up the observed flux considerably , while the nir should show significantly milder evolutionary effects .",
    "excess in the galaxy number density has also been found for higher - redshift quasars or radio galaxies ( dressler et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 ; hutchings 1995 ; pascarelle et al .",
    "these authors claim that the excess galaxies are small compact objects which may be the ` building blocks ' of today s luminous galaxies .",
    "in contrast , many of the galaxies found near 1335.8@xmath02834 are fairly luminous ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "similarly , an excess of @xmath102 galaxies was found near radio - loud quasars at @xmath103 by aragn - salamanca , ellis , and obrien ( 1996 ) .",
    "the situation is therefore not clear , and a systematic study of the fields of a large well - defined sample of known high redshift objects is clearly needed .      in summary",
    ", we have shown that the combination of deep optical and nir imaging is a very powerful tool in revealing high redshift clusters of galaxies and/or their progenitors .",
    "such clusters can provide samples of high redshift galaxies for evolutionary studies at large look - back times , which can greatly contribute to our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution at very early epochs . while this kind of study is very successful at finding candidate clusters , redshifts and morphologies will be ultimately needed .",
