    "non - dissipative hydrodynamical description has been quite successful in explaining the data on low-@xmath0 transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "first results from viscous hydrodynamics suggest , that the viscosity  @xcite of quark - gluon plasma should be small to accommodate the data , in particular those on elliptic flow .",
    "apart from the viscous effects , the main uncertainties in the hydrodynamic modelling of heavy ion collisions lie in the computation of the initial conditions , the choice of equation of state ( eos ) for the qcd matter and , the subject of this paper , the treatment of the freeze - out from a local thermal equilibrium state to free hadrons .",
    "the standard way of handling the freeze - out is the cooper - frye decoupling procedure  @xcite .",
    "also hadron cascade models have been successfully implemented to describe late hadronic dynamics  @xcite , but typically the initial hadron distributions in these simulations are also calculated using the cooper - frye method .",
    "traditionally , the transverse momentum distributions of hadrons at freeze - out are calculated as emissions from a constant - temperature hypersurface , with the value of the decoupling temperature @xmath1 fixed from data . since the constant-@xmath1 cooper - frye decoupling procedure is not based on scattering rates , it can not predict the freeze - out temperature or conditions for the lhc pb+pb collisions . to obtain predictions for hadron @xmath0 spectra at the lhc ,",
    "one often assumes  like we have done in @xcite  that @xmath1 at rhic and lhc are equal .    in this work",
    ", we shall study this uncertainty by determining the decoupling surface by using a dynamical freeze - out condition instead of a constant @xmath1 .",
    "that is , we compare the local hydrodynamical expansion rate with the local scattering rate of pions , and define the cooper - frye freeze - out surface to be where the expansion rate exceeds the scattering rate , possibly multiplied by a constant . to our knowledge",
    ", this idea was first discussed in refs .",
    "impact parameter dependence of freeze - out conditions using the same idea is studied in ref .",
    "the ratio of these two rates can be fixed on the basis of the measured pion @xmath0 spectra at rhic . because this ratio now depends only on the local properties of the system ( temperature and flow )",
    "it can well be expected to remain unchanged in the extrapolation to higher collision energies .",
    "we are thus able to predict the freeze - out surface for the bulk of qcd matter in pb+pb collisions at the lhc based on the dynamics of the system .",
    "we calculate pion @xmath0 spectra using freeze - out surfaces from the dynamical decoupling condition , and compare the results with the constant-@xmath2 decoupling at rhic and lhc .",
    "interestingly , two main results come out of this exercise : first , comparison with the pion @xmath0 spectra at rhic nicely confirms the expectation that the expansion and scattering rates are of the same order at freeze - out .",
    "second , the local dynamical freeze - out condition leads to practically the same effective decoupling temperature at lhc as at rhic which is non - trivial since the evolution of flow is quite different at the two collision energies .",
    "a detailed account of the hydrodynamic setup we use can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider boost - invariant perfect fluid hydrodynamics with transverse expansion for azimuthally symmetric systems , i.e. study ( nearly ) central collisions only .",
    "the eos is given by the bag model , where the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is an ideal gas of massless quarks , antiquarks and gluons , and the hadron resonance gas ( hrg )  @xcite consists of all hadronic states up to a mass 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "critical temperature is fixed to @xmath3 mev at @xmath4 .",
    "full thermalization , both kinetic and chemical , until decoupling is assumed , after which we also include the 2- and 3-body resonance decays of unstable hadronic states .",
    "the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution  the total energy and net - baryon number deposited into a rapidity unit by an initial time  for rhic and lhc @xmath5 collisions , are obtained from the pqcd + ( final state ) saturation model  @xcite as explained in detail in @xcite . in our previous studies  @xcite",
    "the initial energy density was taken to be proportional to the density of nucleon binary collisions ( bc ) . to probe the uncertainty due to the initial transverse geometry , we study also an initial state where the energy density scales with the density of wounded nucleons ( wn ) . in the latter case",
    ", the initial entropy is kept the same as in the bc case .    a measure of the hydrodynamical expansion rate is given by the expansion scalar @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the flow four - velocity of the matter , @xmath8 is the coordinate space rapidity and @xmath9 the longitudinal proper time .",
    "this can be interpreted as the rate of relative volume change @xmath10 in the local rest frame @xcite , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fluid element s proper time .",
    "an easy way to see this is to express entropy conservation in the local rest frame as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the entropy density .",
    "from @xmath15 it follows @xmath16 where the last step follows from @xmath17 constant .",
    "the expansion rate @xmath18 can be easily calculated once the hydrodynamic solution is known .",
    "as long as the microscopic collision rate per particle , @xmath19 , is large relative to the expansion rate , @xmath20 , the system can be assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "since we are here interested in the bulk matter properties only , and since without studying a separate chemical decoupling of heavier particles we can not reproduce their @xmath0 spectra in detail @xcite , we consider only pion - pion collisions in the scattering rate .",
    "we thus approximate the local collision rate per particle as @xmath21 where the density of ( massless ) pions is @xmath22 . for the average pion - pion cross - section at a given temperature @xmath2 , we use the following parametrization , @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath25 , @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev , which reproduces the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the temperature range @xmath29  mev of the hrg phase .",
    "note in particular , how due to the rho resonance peak the cross section decreases with decreasing @xmath2 , instead of a naive dimensional @xmath2-scaling @xmath30 .",
    "note also that we do not need to consider partonic scattering rates at all .",
    "since we are interested in the decoupling of final hadrons , we can limit the rate study to the hrg phase only . in the bjorken picture @xcite of heavy ion collisions , which is adopted here ,",
    "the hydrodynamic expansion starts with very strong longitudinal expansion . in the boost - invariant case without transverse expansion , the fluid velocity ,",
    "@xmath31 , depends only on the coordinate space rapidity @xmath8 , and the ( longitudinal ) expansion rate is given by the inverse of the longitudinal proper time @xmath9 , @xmath32 . during the expansion , pressure gradients develop a strong transverse flow , which leads to an increasing transverse expansion rate .",
    "the decreasing longitudinal and the increasing transverse expansion rates lead to a system where the local expansion rate is high at the spatial boundary of the system , where transverse gradient is strong , while near the center of the fireball the expansion rate is relatively weak .    , phase boundaries and two isotherms in 5 % most central rhic 200 gev au+au collision for bc initial state . reading from the top of the figure , @xmath33 .",

    ", the one with @xmath39 mev corresponds to the freeze - out surface , which leads to an agreement with the rhic data on pion @xmath0 spectra , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "also two flowlines starting from transverse locations @xmath34 fm and @xmath35 fm are drawn in the figure .",
    "figure  2 shows the computed expansion and scattering rates at @xmath41 fm and along the two flowlines in fig .  1 .",
    "for comparison with the case of no transverse expansion , also the expansion rate @xmath37 , due to the longitudinal boost invariant flow only , is shown . as seen in fig .",
    "2 , the system starts its evolution with longitudinal but without transverse expansion and @xmath18 drops like @xmath42 until the increasing transverse expansion starts to contribute to the rate , slowing down its decrease .",
    "interestingly , this can even develop a local maximum of @xmath18 near the boundary of qgp and mixed phase . in fig .",
    "1 the rarefaction wave from the system boundary can be seen as a bending of the @xmath18 contours towards the center of the fireball in the qgp phase .",
    "the same phenomenon can be seen in fig .",
    "2 when the expansion rate starts to exceed the longitudinal expansion rate .",
    "because pressure gradients are stronger near the boundary of the system , the transverse expansion rate grows faster at larger values of transverse radius @xmath43 .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig .  1 , where in the qgp phase the expansion rate grows as a function of @xmath43 at constant @xmath9 .",
    "in the mixed phase pressure gradients vanish , which stops the increase of the expansion rate . in contrast to the behaviour in the qgp phase , in the mixed phase the expansion rate decreases as a function of @xmath43 at constant @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the matter has spent less time in the qgp phase at larger values of @xmath43 , thus there has been less time for transverse flow to develop .",
    "when the system goes through the phase transition into hrg , the shock wave formed generates very strong gradients near the phase boundary in the hrg , and this in turn leads again to a strong increase of the transverse expansion as a function of @xmath43 in the hrg phase .    in summary , the phase transition first slows down the increase of the transverse expansion rate , but this is later counteracted by resulting strong gradients in hadron gas near the phase boundary .",
    "this is seen in fig .  1 , where , as a result of the phase transition , the @xmath18 contours are compressed near the mixed phase and hadron gas boundary .",
    "this effect will be important when we construct the decoupling boundaries by comparing the local scattering rate to the local expansion rate .    in fig .  2 , for the flowline starting from @xmath44 fm ( see the lowest panel ) , we see that @xmath18 can actually decrease below the longitudinal value @xmath42 for a short while during the phase transition .",
    "this is due to a transverse compression rather than expansion in a small region near the boundary during the phase transition , caused by the qgp accelerating against the mixed phase where the pressure gradients are zero and matter is not accelerating .",
    "this is how compressional shock wave is mechanically formed between the qgp and the hrg phases .",
    "same phenomenon can be seen in fig .  1 , where expansion rate has a strong local minimum in the mixed phase near the edge of the fireball .",
    "because the scattering rate is a function of temperature alone , the constant - temperature contours represent also the contours of the scattering rate .",
    "it is clear from fig .  1 that the contours of expansion and reaction rates do not coincide",
    ". both the scattering and expansion rates decrease in general with time , but the decrease of the scattering rate is faster  thanks to the resonance peak in the pion scattering cross section . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "this eventually leads to the situation where the scattering rate drops below the expansion rate , as illustrated in the two top panels of fig .  2 , and this is when the system is expected to decouple .",
    "thus , the decoupling surface is given by the crossing points of the expansion and scattering rate lines like in the two top panels of fig .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the situation near the edge of the system , where the scattering rate in the hrg falls below the expansion rate already at the beginning of the hrg phase . in this case",
    ", we assume the decoupling to take place at the boundary of the mixed phase and the hrg .",
    "figure 3 shows the phase boundaries and constant temperature contours as in fig .  1 , and in addition also the decoupling boundaries from a dynamical condition @xmath45 with different values of the constant @xmath46 .",
    "( the crossing points in fig . 2 correspond to @xmath47 . ) in the hydrodynamic approach with phase transition we can not decouple the matter before it has completely hadronized . thus the decoupling curve can be only in hrg or on the boundary of mixed phase and hrg .",
    "dynamics of the system with phase transition is such that it always forces decoupling curves near the mixed phase  hrg phase boundary , as seen in fig .  1 , where contours of expansion rate are compressed near the boundary .",
    "we only need a slight adjustment to force the freeze - out boundaries to be strictly outside the mixed phase .",
    "it turns out that for the values of @xmath46 considered here , the rate of transverse expansion on the edge of the matter is so large that the decoupling curve always first follows the boundary of the mixed and hrg phases . for the smallest value , @xmath48 , the decoupling curve ( see fig .",
    "3 ) is close to the mentioned phase boundary at all radial distances , but for larger values of @xmath46 the curves separate when the phase boundary curve turns sharply towards the center of the matter .",
    "near the center , where the expansion rate is smaller than at the edge since the contribution from the transverse expansion is small , the freeze - out time can become large and the freeze - out temperature small . thus along a dynamic decoupling curve",
    "the temperature starts from @xmath49 mev at the edge of the matter and drops , for @xmath50 to clearly smaller values of the order of @xmath51 to @xmath52 mev as the curve reaches the center . as seen in fig .",
    "3 , the dynamical decoupling curves typically cross the constant - temperature curves .     corresponding to 5 % most central rhic 200 gev au+au collisions",
    "calculation is initialized with bc profile . also phase boundaries and constant temperature decoupling boundaries are shown.,title=\"fig:\",height=321 ] [ flowrhic_bc ]    for large values of @xmath46",
    "the rather big differences in temperature along the decoupling curve can cause the following problem . without a chemical freeze - out , at or soon after the formation of hadron phase , the density of heavier particles can become much smaller on the flat , space - like part of the decoupling curve than on the time - like part at the edge .",
    "since in the cooper - frye prescription the contribution to the spectrum from the time - like part can become negative at small @xmath0 s , it can happen that too few heavy particles are available on the low temperature space - like part to exceed the negative contributions , and the spectrum may remain negative close to @xmath53 . from our point of view",
    "there is no reason to go to large values of @xmath46 since @xmath54 is the natural assumption .",
    "also , we are considering only pions in this work , and the described effect is much weaker for pions .",
    "finally , we note that so far all the figures shown have been for the bc initial state , but we have checked that similar results also hold for the wn profile .",
    "in 5 % most central rhic 200 gev au+au collisions , computed from constant - temperature decoupling boundaries for different initial states .",
    "the data shown are from brahms  @xcite , phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations.,title=\"fig:\",height=321 ] [ spectrarhic ]     in 5 % most central rhic 200 gev au+au collisions from the dynamical decoupling condition for different values of the constant @xmath46 , compared with the constant - temperature spectra .",
    "the calculation is made for the bc initial conditions.,title=\"fig:\",height=321 ] [ spectrarhic_bc ]     [ spectrarhic_wn ]    in fig .",
    "4 we show our previous results with bc initial profile  @xcite for 5 % most central au+au collisions at @xmath55 gev , compared with the rhic data from brahms  @xcite , phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite collaborations . with the wn profile for the initial energy and net - baryon number densities ,",
    "the pressure gradients are smaller and the transverse flow builds up more slowly . thus a lower @xmath1 is needed with the wn initial profile in order to reproduce the rhic data .",
    "the figure demonstrates that both the bc initial conditions with freeze - out at @xmath56 mev and the wn initial conditions with freeze - out at @xmath57 mev are in good agreement with the data and with each other .",
    "we shall use these constant-@xmath1 results as a comparison baseline in what follows . note how the freeze - out at @xmath58 mev clearly overshoots the data , for both initial conditions .",
    "figure  5 shows the @xmath0-spectra of positive pions , obtained with the bc initialization and using the dynamical decoupling eq .",
    "( [ dec_crit ] ) .",
    "the bc - initialized @xmath59 and 120 mev results from fig .",
    "4 are shown for comparison .",
    "figure 6 shows the corresponding results with the wn initialization .",
    "we notice that for the bc initial condition the @xmath46 values in the range @xmath60 give a reasonable description of the data , the spectra being all close to our previous calculation for @xmath56 mev .",
    "a closer inspection indicates that @xmath61 gives perhaps the best description .",
    "the fact that the constant-@xmath1 leads to very similar spectra as the rate condition with @xmath54 , which we consider to be physically better motivated , shows that also the constant-@xmath1 on the average correctly captures the effects of the rates competition . as indicated by fig .",
    "6 , the use of wn profile supports slightly larger values of @xmath46 , with @xmath62 giving the best description of the data at @xmath63 gev , i.e. in the most relevant region for hydrodynamical models .",
    "on the basis of rhic data we can thus conclude that within our dynamical freeze - out condition , a good description of the data is obtained with @xmath62 .",
    "[ flowlhc_bc ]",
    "in constructing the hypersurface for the cooper - frye decoupling based on the dynamical freeze - out condition , we assume that freeze - out dynamics is governed by local conditions only .",
    "thus we expect that the constant @xmath46 obtained above is independent of the global properties of the system , such as the system size or the centrality of the collision . in particular",
    ", we expect @xmath46 to be independent of the collision energy .",
    "therefore we can use the value of @xmath46 , which is determined from the rhic data , to predict the decoupling boundary at the lhc .",
    "figure  7 shows the phase boundaries and decoupling curves for 5 % most central pb+pb collisions at the lhc energy @xmath64  tev , in the case of the bc profile for the initial energy density .",
    "the behaviour of the decoupling boundaries , which are obtained from the dynamical decoupling condition , is very similar to the rhic results above : during the early times of the evolution decoupling near the spatial boundary of the system occurs immediately after hadronization is complete , while at the center of the fireball the system decouples at later times , when decoupling temperature is significantly lower .",
    "the decoupling boundaries for the wn profile are qualitatively similar to the bc case , and therefore not shown .",
    "[ spectralhc_bc ]     [ spectralhc_wn ]    transverse momentum spectra of positive pions in 5 % most central pb+pb collisions at the lhc , calculated from the decoupling boundaries above are shown in fig .  8 for the bc and fig .  9 for the wn initializations",
    "fixing the proportionality constant @xmath46 between the expansion and scattering rates from the rhic data in fig .  4 ,",
    "our prediction for the positive pion @xmath0 spectra is given by the curves with @xmath65 .",
    "also the constant-@xmath1 results with @xmath56 and 120 mev are shown for the bc initialization in fig .  8 , and with @xmath57 and 120 mev for wn initialization in fig .",
    "we make the following interesting observations :    _ ( i ) _ once the value of @xmath46 is fixed from rhic data , take e.g. @xmath47 with the bc initialization ( figs . 4 and 8) , the dynamical decoupling results both at rhic and lhc are reproduced with the same @xmath59  mev .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 does not change considerably from rhic to lhc .",
    "the same holds for the results for wn initialization , with effective @xmath66  mev .",
    "upper limit @xmath67 corresponds a slightly smaller effective @xmath1 in both cases .",
    "thus , in our hydrodynamical framework , we expect effective @xmath1 to be in the range @xmath68 mev .    _ ( ii ) _ the lhc pion spectra obtained with @xmath65 or with an effective @xmath59  mev for the bc case in fig . 8 , or with an effective @xmath66  mev for the wn case in fig . 9 ,",
    "are all very close to each other .",
    "this shows that our lhc predictions for pion spectra @xcite are not very sensitive to the uncertainties of the initial profile , provided that the rhic data have been exploited to constrain the decoupling dynamics .    _",
    "( iii ) _ as seen in figs .",
    "4 - 6 , the rhic data outrules the values of @xmath46 which would be much larger than 1 - 2 . correspondingly , as shown before @xcite , a low effective constant @xmath1 , can not be used at rhic .",
    "the present study of local dynamic decoupling condition lends support to the prediction that if constant-@xmath1 decoupling is used , low @xmath1 values are unlikely also at the lhc .    _",
    "( iv ) _ intuitively , since the flow develops faster already in the plasma phase at the lhc than at rhic , one might anticipate the decoupling at the lhc to happen at higher effective temperatures than at rhic .",
    "the present study , especially the bc case , now shows that the effective decoupling temperature in central pb+pb collisions at the lhc is in fact quite close to that in central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "we have computed the transverse momentum spectra of pions in nearly central au+au collisions at rhic and pb+pb collisions at the lhc within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics , by taking the initial conditions from a pqcd + saturation model . in particular , we have applied a dynamical decoupling condition @xcite , where we compare the local expansion rate to the local pion - pion scattering rate .",
    "the proportionality constant between the two rates at decoupling is extracted from the rhic data on pion transverse momentum spectra .",
    "the same proportionality constant is then used to present predictions of pion spectra at the lhc .",
    "although the model is simple and we consider pion - pion collisions and pion spectra only , the fact that the proportionality constant obtained is of the order of unity , gives us some confidence that we have captured an essential part of the physics in the breakdown of the hydrodynamic stage of matter into final free hadrons .",
    "the dynamical decoupling condition does not necessarily indicate the end of all hadronic interactions , but for @xmath69 interactions this is expected to be the case , at least in the sense that interactions can not maintain local thermal equilibrium .",
    "nucleons most likely decouple somewhat later than pions because of the strong @xmath70 resonance in @xmath71 interactions  @xcite . for pions",
    ", however , this is only a minor effect , due to the small number of nucleons compared to pions .",
    "a consistent modelling of these interesting details is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "studying both binary collision and wounded nucleon profiles for the initial energy densities , we have compared the results obtained with the dynamical decoupling criterion to those obtained with effective constant freeze - out temperatures .",
    "we find that the effective freeze - out temperatures for pions at the lhc will be very close to those at rhic , @xmath72 mev .",
    "with the dynamical decoupling criterion , we also find that the hydrodynamic prediction of the pion @xmath0 spectra at the lhc is fairly insensitive to the details of initial transverse profile , once the total entropy is fixed and once the decoupling dynamics is first constrained by the rhic data .",
