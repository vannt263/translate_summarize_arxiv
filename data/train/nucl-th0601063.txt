    "the internal structure of hadrons has been extensively studied using elastic and inelastic electron scattering . for a theoretical understanding of such processes one",
    "traditionally relies on the leading order ( born ) contribution , an exchange of a single virtual photon between the electron and the hadron .",
    "the generally suppressed higher - order terms , including two - photon exchange contributions , have also been considered ( see e.  g.  refs .",
    "more recently , the particular importance of the two - photon exchange contributions has been emphasized  @xcite since these corrections are necessary to explain simultaneously two distinct types of electron - proton scattering experiments : the rosenbluth separation and the polarization - transfer techniques .",
    "therefore , our understanding of such fundamental quantities as the nucleon electromagnetic form factors can not be complete without including two - photon exchange effects in the analyses of elastic electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "inelastic reactions allow one to obtain additional crucial information on hadronic structure .",
    "of particular interest is the situation where the final hadronic state in an electron - proton collision lies in the @xmath0 resonance region .",
    "this reaction has been recently studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , it is important as one of the simplest processes involving the electromagnetic nucleon - to-@xmath0 transition current ( @xmath2 vertex ) which parametrizes the one - photon exchange amplitude . by analogy with the case of elastic scattering ,",
    "it is obvious that although the one - photon exchange mechanism is generally dominant , two - photon exchange effects in @xmath0 production can be quite important and thus have to be carefully examined .",
    "this paper describes a calculation of two - photon exchange corrections to the unpolarized cross section for @xmath0 production in electron - proton collisions .",
    "we use a quantum field theoretical approach , computing the box , crossed - box and an additional contact term diagrams ( the latter is required for gauge invariance and is constructed by minimal substitution ) . as the intermediate hadronic states in the loop diagrams , we include a nucleon and a @xmath0 .",
    "the two - photon exchange effects from the intermediate nucleon and @xmath0 have opposite sings in most kinematical regimes , being pronounced even at low energies .",
    "an important theoretical ingredient of the calculation is the @xmath1 vertex .",
    "various forms of this vertex feature prominently in the studies of electromagnetic interactions of the deuteron  @xcite and three - nucleon bound states  @xcite , as well as in the recent extraction  @xcite of the @xmath0 magnetic dipole moment . in the present calculation",
    "we will show that the angular nonlinearity of the two - photon exchange correction is rather sensitive to the value and sign of the ( dominant ) @xmath1 magnetic coupling constant .",
    "being formulated in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom , our model is somewhat complementary to the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite where two - photon exchange effects were calculated using the formalism of generalised parton distributions .",
    "the differential cross section for the unpolarized @xmath0 production process in the electron - proton collisions can be written as = _ b ( 1+_2 ) , where @xmath3 is the one - photon exchange ( born ) cross section and @xmath4 is a two - photon exchange correction .",
    "we do not recapitulate in this paper the calculation of the standard radiative corrections such as the vacuum polarization , electron self - energy and vertex loops , as well as the soft - photon bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "the derivation of these contributions is well - known  @xcite and they are taken into account in data analyses  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the soft - photon emission is necessary to obtain an infrared convergent amplitude ; this contribution is included in our calculation as will be explained in .",
    "as two independent kinematical variables we choose @xmath5 , the square of the momentum transferred in the collision , and @xmath6 , the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon exchanged in the born approximation . in the laboratory frame , @xmath6 is related to the electron scattering angle @xmath7 through @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the nucleon and @xmath0 masses , respectively . to leading order in the electromagnetic coupling constant",
    ", the two - photon exchange correction is evaluated from _ 2 = 2 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the born and the two - photon exchange scattering amplitudes , respectively .",
    "the loop diagrams for the two - photon exchange amplitude , as calculated in  , are shown in  .",
    "these include the contributions of nucleon and @xmath0 intermediate states , plus an additional contact term necessary to ensure gauge invariance of the full amplitude ( see  ) .",
    "the loop diagrams in   consist of the propagators of the intermediate particles , three - point hadronic vertices and a four - point contact term .",
    "the construction of the contact term is explained in  ; the three - point vertices and two - point propagators are described in this section .",
    "the @xmath14 vertex is chosen in the standard form , depending only on the photon four - momentum @xmath15 : _ ( q ) = _ f_1(q^2 ) + i f_2(q^2 ) , where @xmath16 denote the dirac and pauli form factors , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 vertex is taken as  @xcite v^(p , q ) = \\ { g_1 + g_2 } _ 5 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the four - momenta of an incoming photon and an outgoing @xmath0 , respectively , and the coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the magnetic and electric components of the vertex .",
    "( for simplicity , the strongly suppressed coulomb component is not included in this calculation ) . as in the @xmath14 vertex ,",
    "the @xmath2 form factor @xmath21 is taken as a function of the photon four - momentum squared only .",
    "we choose the @xmath1 vertex in the following form : _ ^(p,p;q)=",
    "f_(q^2 ) p^2 p^2 ^3/2_(p ) ( g^ q^-",
    "g^ q^ ) ^3/2_(p ) , where @xmath22 is the coupling constant , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath17 are the four - momentum components of the outgoing @xmath0 , incoming @xmath0 and incoming photon , respectively , and the spin @xmath25 projection operator equals ^3/2_(p ) = g _ - - .",
    "note that the most general form of the @xmath1 vertex contains several independent structures .",
    "however , the coupling constants in the general vertex are hard to extract from data and hence are subject to some uncertainty at present  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to keep the computations tractable , we have chosen in   a form of the @xmath1 vertex containing only a magnetic dipole component , which is expected to be dominant  @xcite .",
    "other structures are omitted ; in particular , a component proportional solely to the electric charge of the @xmath0 is not included in  .    even though the @xmath2 and @xmath1 vertices used in this calculation",
    "are not of the most general form , it is important that they posses the following transversality properties : the scalar products of both vertices   and   with the four - momenta of the photon or either @xmath0 vanish . the photon transversality is necessary for electromagnetic gauge invariance  @xcite of the calculation .",
    "the orthogonality to the @xmath0 four - momentum ensures propagation of only the physical component of the @xmath0 , thus allowing us to use only the spin @xmath25 part @xmath26 of the rarita - schwinger propagator ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this property ) . for the nucleon",
    "we take the standard free fermion propagator @xmath27 .    the nonlocality of the hadron - photon interactions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nngam ] , [ eq : ndgam ] ) and ( [ eq : ddgam ] ) is described by the form factors @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the form factors are necessary to ensure ultraviolet convergence of the loop integrals calculated in  .",
    "the results presented below were obtained using the standard dipole form for all these form factors : f(q^2)= , where @xmath31 is the cutoff mass .",
    "more details on the choice of the form factor will be given in  .",
    "the requirement of electromagnetic gauge invariance can be formulated for the two - photon exchange graphs in   in the following manner . first we  strip off \" the electron line together with the attached photon propagators and thus consider only the remaining hadron part . for the purposes of this section",
    ", the four - momentum of the incoming proton will be denoted as @xmath33 , that of the outgoing @xmath0 as @xmath34 , and those of the initial and final photons as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ( both photons incoming ) , so that the four - momentum conservation in this notation reads @xmath37 .",
    "we denote the thus obtained hadronic amplitude as @xmath38 .",
    "gauge invariance then leads to the orthogonality conditions ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite ) q^ _ ( q,q;p,p)= q^ _ ( q,q;p,p)=0 .",
    "first we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gi ] ) are not satisfied by the sum @xmath39 , where ^box_(q,q;p,p)= v_(q,p ) s(p+q ) _ ( q ) , ^xbox_(q,q;p,p)= v_(q , p ) s(p+q ) _",

    "( [ eq : nngam][eq : ddgam ] ) , the free nucleon propagator @xmath40 and the dirac equation for the incoming nucleon and outgoing @xmath0 . to obtain a gauge invariant amplitude ,",
    "an additional @xmath32 contact term @xmath41 ( depicted by the triangle in  ) has to be added to the box and crossed - box diagrams .",
    "such a term can be constructed by the standard procedure of minimal substitution ( the technical details can be found for example in ref .",
    "an inherent property of the minimal substitution is that it yields unambiguously only the contact term longitudinal to the photons four - momenta ( which is sufficient for current conservation ) . following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the contact term ^ct_(q,q;p,p)= - f_1(q^2 ) v_(p,q ) - f_1(q^2 ) v_(p,q ) .",
    "it can be verified now that the sum of the nucleon box , crossed - box and contact term amplitudes _ ( q,q;p,p)=^box_(q,q;p,p ) + ^xbox_(q,q;p,p)+ ^ct_(q,q;p,p ) , obeys  , i.  e.  the upper row of   is gauge invariant .    finally , using the vertices and propagators given in  , it is easy to see that the sum of the box and crossed - box amplitudes with an intermediate @xmath0 ( the lower part of  ) is gauge invariant by itself",
    ". therefore the sum of the loop diagrams depicted in   constitute a gauge invariant two - photon exchange amplitude .",

    "the full amplitude , comprising the sum of the above loop integrals , is both infrared and ultraviolet convergent .",
    "the ultraviolet convergence is provided through the presence of regularising form factors in the integrands of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : integr_n],[eq : integr_d ] ) and ( [ eq : integr_ct ] ) .",
    "the infrared divergence from the box and crossed - box diagrams with an intermediate nucleon is obtained by putting @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : num_n_box ] ) and ( [ eq : num_n_x - box ] ) ( these integrals converge at @xmath47 ) .",
    "this divergence is cancelled in the standard way against the corresponding divergence of the soft - photon emission contributions  @xcite . in our approach ,",
    "the latter enter as part of the loop diagram with the contact term , obtained from the divergences of   at @xmath46 ( to cancel the divergence of the box integral ) and @xmath47 ( to cancel the divergence of the crossed - box integral ) .",
    "we incorporate the soft - photon divergence into the contact term merely for convenience , so that in addition to restoring gauge invariance , the contact term also ensures the infrared convergence . as an additional check ,",
    "we confirmed numerically that the full amplitude is indeed convergent .",
    "we calculated the loop integrals eqs .",
    "( [ eq : integr_n],[eq : integr_d],[eq : integr_ct ] ) using techniques similar to those described in  @xcite .",
    "the result of the integration is obtained analytically as a sum of several passarino - veltman dilogarithms  @xcite , each multiplied by a rational function of kinematic invariants . although simple in structure , the explicit expressions are quite lengthy and therefore would not be useful within the limits of this paper .",
    "we checked that the calculation obeys the constraint of crossing symmetry , i.  e.  the amplitude is invariant under an interchange of the mandelstam variables , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "the conditions of crossing symmetry and gauge invariance are important because they put strong model independent constraints on the behaviour of the amplitudes .    10.0 cm",
    "we did several calculations of the two - photon exchange correction using various functional forms of the regularizing form factor in the hadronic vertices , including dipole and monopole functions with several values of the cutoff .",
    "we found that the essential features of the results are largely independent of the details of the form factor .",
    "this is because the form factor is partially cancelled when @xmath4 is expressed as the ratio  .    as a representative example , we show in   the two - photon exchange correction which was obtained using the dipole form factor   with the cutoff @xmath48 gev .",
    "this choice is known to be compatible with the nucleon mean - square radius .",
    "changing the form factor ( for example , using a monopole cutoff of a similar size ) has no significant effect on @xmath4 over most of the kinematic range in @xmath6 , with only a mild influence for @xmath49 .    as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath1 vertex is an important ingredient of this calculation .",
    "recent experimental analyses  @xcite of rosenbluth separations focused on the possibility to identify two - photon exchange effects through a nonlinearity of the cross section as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the nonlinear behaviour of the two - photon exchange corrections was also addressed in theoretical studies .",
    "thus , general properties of two - photon exchange corrections in elastic electron - proton scattering were derived in ref .",
    "nonlinearities induced by two - photon exchanges were searched for in the data for electron - deuteron  @xcite and electron - proton  @xcite scattering .    in the present calculation of @xmath0 production in _",
    "inelastic _ electron - proton collisions we find a pronounced dependence of the two - photon correction on the value of the magnetic @xmath1 coupling constant @xmath22 .",
    "as shown in  , the sign of @xmath22 is related to the qualitatively distinct nonlinearities of @xmath4 in @xmath6 .",
    "an essentially linear behaviour of the two - photon correction is consistent with @xmath50 , corresponding to the presence of only a nucleon intermediate state and no intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "the current analysis  @xcite of experimental rosenbluth separations in electron - proton collisions indicated only a very small nonlinearity , although additional data should allow one to reach a more definite conclusion about the nonlinearities .    12.0 cm",
    "an accurate description of electron - proton scattering in the resonance region is essential for the understanding of the structure and interactions of hadrons . using born approximation to analyze @xmath0 production in electron - proton scattering",
    ", one can obtain important information of the @xmath2 transition current .",
    "however , such an analysis should also include two - photon exchange higher - order corrections .",
    "the two - photon exchange corrections calculated in this paper are generally much smaller than the born contribution , as should be expected from perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that the two - photon exchange corrections can be quite important for a precise analysis of the electron - proton scattering in the resonance region .    for further progress in the evaluation of higher - order effects in electron - nucleon collisions , a more detailed knowledge of the @xmath1 vertex",
    "is needed .",
    "we have shown that the nonlinearity of the @xmath6 dependence of the two - photon correction can be related to the sign of the magnetic @xmath1 coupling constant .",
    "in particular , a linear dependence would suggest that the contribution of an intermediate @xmath0 state to the two - photon exchange correction is negligible in comparison with that of the nucleon intermediate state .",
    "the question whether the link between the magnetic @xmath1 coupling and the @xmath6 nonlinearity might be affected by using more general forms of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices falls outside the scope of this paper , but should be addressed in more detailed studies in the future .",
    "another interesting problem to be addressed in the future is the role of higher mass resonances in the intermediate states , in addition to the essential contribution of the nucleon and @xmath0 considered in this paper .",
    "finally , we point out that the present calculation is one of the few existing theoretical studies of the two - photon exchange effects in the @xmath0 production reaction ; therefore , additional investigations would certainly be useful and interesting .",
