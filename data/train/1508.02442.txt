    "recent technological advances make it possible to realise simple mechanical devices in the microscopic and nanoscopic regimes , the properties of which are determined by quantum effects @xcite .",
    "the existence of these represents a remarkable opportunity for fundamental studies of light - matter interactions @xcite and also the potential for practical application to quantum communications and information processing @xcite . yet",
    "they present also a challenge to existing methods of analysis , many of which were developed to treat more rapidly oscillating systems with weaker couplings .",
    "the quantum theory of machines is built , to a large extent on the theory of oscillators and strongly coupled oscillators , which are coupled to one or more environments each of which is at a characteristic temperature @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of these quantum systems is governed not simply by average properties but also fluctuations , and has been informed by the development of fluctuation theorems for quantum open systems @xcite .",
    "the coupling to the environment needs to be handled with some care , however , because of the possibility of quantum coherence and the development of entanglement between the system of interest and its environment , with the result that apparently unphysical behaviours may emerge @xcite .",
    "the requirement to treat the coupling to the reservoirs with care provides the incentive to return to the problem of a single strongly - damped oscillator and to treat this model exactly .",
    "there exist at present mathematically and physically acceptable methods for treating strongly damped quantum oscillators , but most of these do not retain the simplicity of their classical counterparts .",
    "our aim is to recover at least some of this simplicity .",
    "we do not seek to apply familiar techniques developed for weakly damped systems , but proceed instead by means of an exact diagonlisation of the oscillator - reservoir hamiltonian .",
    "this approach is complementary to that adopted by philbin who has tackled this problem of the oscillator evolution using green functions @xcite .",
    "we hope that the combination of his work and ours will provide a more complete understanding .",
    "our procedure produces a single positive function of frequency the integral of which is unity .",
    "we can interpret this quantity as the frequency spectrum or probability density for the oscillator in its ground state .",
    "the steady - state of the oscillator , its entanglement with the environment , its energy and much of its dynamics can be understood in terms of this probability . before embarking on this programme , let us pause to review some of the background to our study .",
    "the harmonic oscillator has a special place in physics as one of the simplest and most widely employed of physical models .",
    "the reasons for its ubiquity , no doubt , are its simplicity and the fact that it is readily analysed . in the quantum domain ,",
    "the harmonic oscillator is barely more difficult to treat than its classical counterpart and was one of the first dynamical systems to which schrdinger applied his equation @xcite . today",
    ", both the classical and quantum forms appear in elementary courses on classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "the damped harmonic oscillator loses energy as a result of coupling to the surrounding environment . in the classical domain it often suffices to describe this in terms of a simple damping coefficient , @xmath0 , and an associated stochastic or langevin force @xcite , @xmath1 , which models the effect of environmental fluctuations on the oscillator @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is described by a simple linear differential equation of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the oscillating particle .",
    "there is no requirement for detailed knowledge of the fluctuating force , which may be considered to have a very short correlation time with a magnitude determined by the requirements of thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the damped quantum harmonic oscillator requires that explicit account be taken of the quantum nature of the environmental degrees of freedom @xcite , which are most simply described by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "if the damping is very weak , so that @xmath4 , then we can neglect rapidly oscillating terms in the coupling between the oscillator and the environmental oscillators by making the rotating wave approximation , which corresponds to enforcing the conservation of the total number of vibrational quanta , and then the born and markov approximations associated with weak coupling and loss of memory in the reservoir @xcite .",
    "this leads to the master equations and heisenberg - langevin equations that are ubiquitous , most especially , in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "if the coupling is somewhat stronger then it may not be possible to make the rotating wave approximation and we then need to retain in the hamiltonian terms that can create or annihilate a pair of quanta , one in the damped oscillator and , at the same time , one in the environment .",
    "this leads to the caldeira - leggett model @xcite , which we describe in the the following section , and which has been applied to study a wide variety of quantum open systems @xcite .",
    "a variant on the model has been applied to the quantum theory of light in dielectric @xcite and magneto - dielectric media @xcite .",
    "an important complication that seems to be an inevitable consequence working in this strong - coupling regime is the failure of the markov approximation ; attempts to enforce this approximation lead to a master equation that is unphysical in that there exist initial states for which the dynamics leads to negative probabilities @xcite .",
    "it is possible to derive a master equation but the resulting equation is one that has within it non - trivial time - dependent coefficients @xcite .",
    "this time - dependence is a clear signature of the non - markovian nature of the associated evolution .",
    "it seems that this non - markovian character is an inevitable feature of the strongly - damped quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "consider a harmonic oscillator of natural angular frequency @xmath5 that is strongly coupled to a large collection of oscillators , with a range of frequencies , through their respective positions as depicted in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "we write the hamiltonian for the combined oscillator - reservoir system in the form @xcite @xmath6 if we complete the square we can rewrite this in a minimal - coupling form to arrive at the alternative form : @xmath7 , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 each term in our hamiltonian is strictly positive only if this quantity is positive . if it is negative",
    "then the second term is also negative and the hamiltonian is not bounded from below and hence not allowed physically .",
    "hence the positivity of the hamiltonian places a physical restriction on the strength of the coupling @xmath9    it is convenient to rewrite our hamiltonian in terms of the familiar annihilation and creation operators : @xmath10 in terms of these operators our hamiltonian becomes @xmath11 when unimportant constant shifts in the ground - state energies are removed and @xmath12 when written in terms of this quantity , our positivity condition ( [ eq5 ] ) becomes @xmath13    there is one further refinement that we need to introduce before considering the diagonalisation of the hamiltonian and this it to introduce a continuum description of the environment . to this end",
    "we introduce continuum annihilation and creation operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , satisfying the commutation relations @xmath16",

    "we could seek to solve these equations of motion and this would lead to an operator heisenberg - langevin equation analogous to ( [ eq1 ] ) . here",
    "we adopt the different approach of diagonalising the hamiltonian .",
    "we seek to diagonalise the hamiltonian by finding a complete set of eigenoperators , @xmath19 and their conjugates @xmath20 that satisfy the operator equations @xmath21",

    "these eigenoperators are complete if , in addition to these they also satisfy the condition @xmath23 = \\delta(\\omega-\\omega ' )   .\\ ] ] these operator equations are the natural analogues of the more familiar eigenvalue and completeness conditions for the eigenstates of a hamiltonian . in analogy with the eigenvalue problem , we expand each of the eigenoperators as a superposition of a complete set of operators : @xmath24 , \\ ] ] and then use the eigenoperator equations and completeness condition to determine the coefficients in this expansion .",
    "the calculation is a little involved but the main points are summarised in [ fano ] .",
    "we can express any of the annihilation and creation operators for the oscillator or the reservoir in terms of our eigenoperators . to do this we write the desired operator as a superposition of all the @xmath19 and @xmath20 operators and then use the commutation relations to extract the coefficients in this expansion .",
    "for the oscillator operators we find @xmath25 the requirement that these operators satisfy the familiar boson commutation relation , @xmath26 = 1 $ ] , provides a constraint on the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the form @xmath29 =   \\int_0^\\infty d\\omega |\\alpha(\\omega)|^2\\frac{4\\omega_0\\omega}{(\\omega_0 + \\omega)^2 } = 1 , \\ ] ] where we have used ( [ eqa10 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correctness of this may be verified explicitly by contour integration , but that the proof makes explicit use of the positivity condition ( [ eq12 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the integrand in ( [ eq17 ] ) is clearly positive ( or zero ) for all frequencies and hence has the mathematical form of a frequency probability distribution : @xmath30 a number of further constraints on this quantity emerge naturally from thinking of it as a probability distribution and from our diagonalisation .",
    "we leave until the next section the question of the physical interpretation of the probability density @xmath31 but consider here what can be inferred from the fact that it has the mathematical properties of a probability distribution . to this end",
    "let us denote the average value of a function of frequency for this distribution by @xmath32 we note that @xmath33 is finite for all @xmath22 and it follows , therefore , from ( [ eq18 ] ) that the average value @xmath34 is finite .",
    "it follows from the eigenoperator equations ( [ eq13 ] ) that we can write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an unimportant constant .",
    "if we substitute into this hamiltonian our expression for the eigenoperators ( [ eq15 ] ) we require that the coefficients of @xmath37 and @xmath38 should vanish so that @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 the fact that the square of the mean value can not exceed the mean value of the square for any probability distribution leads us to deduce that @xmath41    finally we can apply the cauchy - schwartz inequality to provide a lower bound on the value of @xmath34 : @xmath42 these inequalities are useful in determining the properties of the ground state .",
    "it is immediately clear from the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq11 ] ) that the ground state of the oscillator is not that of the undamped oscillator , that is the state annihilated by @xmath43 . to see this",
    "we need only note that the interaction term @xmath44 acts on the combined ground state of the non - interacting oscillator and reservoir , adding a quantum to each .",
    "this suggests that the true ground state should be a superposition of states with varying numbers of quanta in both the oscillator and the reservoir and hence an entangled state .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the ground state of an atom in quantum electrodynamics , which is dressed by virtual photons @xcite .",
    "the dressing of the ground - state atom is responsible for a number of important effects including the casimir - polder interaction @xcite and the form of the polarizability of the atom @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that it will be similarly significant for our strongly damped oscillator .",
    "the true ground state , which we denote by the ket @xmath45 , is the zero - eigenvalue eigenstate of all the annihilation operators",
    "@xmath19 : @xmath46 the ground - state properties of the oscillator in this pure state are described by a mixed state density operator obtained by tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom : @xmath47 the most straightforward way to determine the form of this mixed state is to use the characteristic function @xcite : @xmath48 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\langle 0|\\exp\\left(\\xi\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\xi^*\\hat{a}\\right)|0\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function provides a complete description of the state and all of its statistical properties .",

    "we note , in passing , that the quadrature operators for the oscillator ( familiar from quantum optics @xcite ) have unequal uncertainties : @xmath58 the product of these two exceeds @xmath59 , as it must , by virtue of the cauchy - schwartz inequality ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "we have established that in the ground state , the reduced state of the oscillator is gaussian in position and momentum and , as such , is completely determined by the first and second moments of the position and momentum .",
    "these moments are @xmath60 we note that the frequency of the undamped oscillator , @xmath5 , makes no explicit appearance in these expectation values .",
    "the mean energy of the oscillator alone is @xmath61 the fact that this exceeds the ground - state energy of the undamped oscillator is a reflection of the fact that there is an energy cost to be paid in order to decouple the oscillator from its environment @xcite .",
    "we note , further , that the mean kinetic energy and potential energy for the oscillator alone do not have the same value and that this is in marked contrast to the ground state of the undamped oscillator .",
    "we can diagonalise the density operator for the oscillator alone , @xmath62 , by means of a squeezing transformation @xcite or , equivalently , introducing a new pair of annihilation and creation operators corresponding to a new oscillation frequency , @xmath63 : @xmath64 to complete the diagonalisation we need only choose @xmath63 such that the expectation values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are zero : @xmath67 this frequency is , by virtue of ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) , less than @xmath5 , the natural frequency of the undamped oscillator .",
    "the appearance of a reduced oscillation frequency is reminiscent of the observed reduction in the oscillation frequency of a damped classical oscillator but unlike in the classical case , the frequency @xmath63 remains real even in the heavily damped regime .",
    "we note that philbin and horsley arrived at a similar reduced but always real frequency , which they associated with a decrease in the zero point energy @xcite .",
    "the mean number of @xmath68-quanta in the oscillator ground - state is @xmath69 which exceeds @xmath70 , as it should , by virtue of ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "when written in terms of the @xmath68-quanta , the steady - state density operator takes the form of a thermal bose - einstein state , which we can write in the form @xmath71 we may interpret this state as a thermal state for the oscillator at the shifted ( and reduced ) frequency @xmath63 and at an effective  temperature \" @xmath72 we should note , however , that the true temperature in the ground - state is zero and that this quantity and the frequency @xmath63 are at most only parameters with which to quantify the state of the oscillator and its entanglement with the environment . in particular , the von - neumann entropy associated with the steady state of the oscillator is @xmath73 and that , by virtue of the araki - lieb inequality @xcite and the fact that the full state is pure , means that this is also the total entropy of the environment : @xmath74 and that the quantum mutual information @xcite , or index of correlation @xcite , between the oscillator and the environment is @xmath75",
    "we have seen that the physical properties of the oscillator ground state may readily be expressed in terms of moments of the frequency given the probability distribution @xmath31 . here",
    "we present the case for identifying this probability density with the contribution from the dressed modes , associated with the eigenoperators @xmath19 , to the the state of the oscillator .",
    "it is in , in essence , the spectrum of the true ground - state modes contributing to the oscillator state .",
    "we present three arguments to support this interpretation .",
    "our first justification arises from the form of the expectation values ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "we know that the ground state of a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath22 has @xmath76 if we treat the state of the oscillator as a mixture of oscillators of different frequencies , each in its ground state , and contribution with weight @xmath31 then the resulting average mean - square values will be @xmath77 which correspond to those obtained above .",
    "our second point arises from the form of the hamiltonian for the oscillator @xmath78 we can , by virtue of ( [ eq22 ] ) , write this as a combination of potentials corresponding to different frequencies but weighted by @xmath31 : @xmath79    finally we note that the effective mean energy of the oscillator , which is associated with the diagonal form of the density operator ( [ eq36 ] ) is @xmath80 which combines the characteristic ground state energies of the dressed oscillators , weighted by the probability distribution @xmath31 .",
    "the combination of these three features leads us to interpret @xmath31 as the proportion of the corresponding dressed oscillators contributing to the properties of the damped oscillator .",
    "we emphasise that the mathematical results obtained in the preceding section do not _ require _ us to adopt this interpretation of @xmath31 but we find it helpful to do so .",
    "the exact diagonalisation of the hamiltonian makes it straightforward to evaluate the time - evolution of any desired property of the oscillator .",
    "all that we need do is to express the desired observable in terms of the eigenoperators , @xmath19 and @xmath20 and then use the time evolution of these operators , the form of which is an elementary consequence of the fact that they are eigenoperators : @xmath81 in particular , we can determine the time - evolution of the annihilation operator for the oscillator in this way : @xmath82   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left .",

    "we note that if the environment is in a stationary state , so that @xmath83 , then the expectation values of the position and momentum operators take a pleasingly simple form : @xmath84 where the double angle brackets denote , as before , averages over our probability distribution @xmath31 as in ( [ eq19 ] ) .",
    "the form of these equations adds further support to our interpretation of @xmath31 as a frequency probability distribution for the damped oscillator , as they may be viewed as the evolution of an undamped oscillator with a frequency @xmath22 averaged using this probability distribution .",
    "the dissipation arises simply from a dephasing amongst the different frequency components .",
    "the evolution of the mean position and momentum , as given in ( [ eq48 ] ) , has the necessary short - time form of that for an undamped oscillator @xmath85 where we have used the identity @xmath86 .",
    "the effects of the coupling to the environment enter at order @xmath87 and this is an indication of the essentially non - markovian nature of the strongly - damped oscillator .",
    "our interest is in strongly damped oscillators and so we should note that ( [ eq48 ] ) includes the possibilities of both critically - damped and over - damped evolution .",
    "the equations contain , moreover , a simple criterion for these , which we may express in terms of our probability distribution . the motion will be oscillatory if @xmath88 has stationary points at times other than at @xmath89 .",
    "alternatively , we may state that the motion is under - damped if the derivative of this quantity , that is @xmath90 , is zero for any time other than @xmath89 .",
    "if it is zero only at @xmath89 then the motion is critically - damped or over - damped .",
    "our expression for the evolved annihilation operator ( [ eq47 ] ) , together with the corresponding one for the creation operator provide a full description of the oscillator dynamics .",
    "this is true for any initial state of the oscillator and , moreover , for any environmental state including , of course , that associated with a finite temperature . as an illustration let us examine the evolution of the characteristic function for an arbitrary initial state of the oscillator coupled to a zero - temperature environment at time @xmath91 . with a little effort",
    "we find @xmath92\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\infty d\\omega '   \\left|\\int_0^\\infty d\\omega \\ : \\mu(\\omega,\\omega',t)\\right|^2\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath93 \\nonumber \\\\ \\mu(\\omega,\\omega',t ) = \\eta(\\omega , t)\\gamma^*(\\omega,\\omega ' ) - \\eta^*(\\omega , t)\\delta^*(\\omega,\\omega ' ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\eta(\\omega , t ) = \\left[\\xi\\alpha(\\omega)+\\xi^*\\beta(\\omega)\\right]e^{i\\omega t } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this characteristic function encodes the full dynamics and statistics of the oscillator . as a simple illustration of this we can determine the form of the steady state . to see this",

    "we find @xmath97 so the steady - state characteristic function is @xmath98 which we recognise as the characteristic function for the oscillator in the global ground state ( [ eq28 ] ) .",
    "this is a most satisfactory and exact result .",
    "the theory developed above was designed to treat the strongly - damped harmonic oscillator , but should also be applicable to the more familiar weakly damped oscillator , for which the oft - employed born and markov approximations are applicable and the steady state of the oscillator should be its ground state .",
    "we show here that this is indeed the case .",
    "we start by considering the form of the function @xmath27 in the weak coupling limit . to aid our analysis we rewrite the form given in ( [ eqa18 ] ) as @xmath99 the weak damping limit corresponds to choosing the coupling to the environment to be small or , more specifically , to @xmath100 .",
    "it is clear that in this limit , @xmath33 will be a sharply peaked function centred around the frequency for which @xmath101 .",
    "if the integral part in @xmath102 , as given in ( [ eqa15 ] ) is small then this frequency will be close to @xmath5 and we can write @xmath103 this leads , in turn , to a corresponding approximate form for @xmath27 : @xmath104 where we have set @xmath105 everywhere except in the denominator .",
    "we note that this is of the form that arises from the fano diagonalisation of our problem if we make the rotating wave approximation by omitting from our original hamiltonian all terms that are products of two creation operators or of two annihilation operarors @xcite .",
    "consistency with the above approximation , which led us to set @xmath105 leads us to set @xmath28 to zero : @xmath106 so that the integral over all frequency of @xmath33 is unity .",
    "hence in this limit the steady - state characteristic function for our oscillator is @xmath107 which we recognise as that for the ground state of the undamped oscillator @xcite .",
    "further , we note that in this limit our probability distribution function , latexmath:[$\\pi(\\omega ) \\approx     @xmath5 , with some width @xmath0 . , but the corresponding quantity for a true lorentzian is divergent . ]",
    "thus all the complexity of of the original problem is reduced , in the weak - damping limit to just two parameters : a natural oscillation frequency and a damping rate .",
    "it was important to confirm that our more general treatment coincided , in the right limit , with the approximate methods used for weakly damped oscillators .",
    "we should note that even if we are working in the weakly damped regime , then our approach offers a systematic way to treat corrections to the results obtained using the born and markov approximations , which may play an important role in modelling measurements at the limits of sensitivity .",
    "we have presented an exact diagonalisation of a simple quantum model of the damped harmonic oscillator , one that is applicable , in particular , to strong damping .",
    "we have found that much of the behaviour of the oscillator and may of its properties can be described in terms of a single probability function , @xmath31 , which we may interpret as the contribution of corresponding dressed mode , at frequency @xmath22 to the oscillator .",
    "these properties include the steady state of the oscillator at zero temperature , the entanglement between the oscillator and its environment and also its evolution , both in the familiar under - damped regime but also in the more problematic over - damped regime .",
    "we have applied our diagonalisation to study the properties of the true ground state and have shown that the oscillator part of this pure entangled state coincides with the steady - state of the oscillator in a zero - temperature environment .",
    "the diagonalisation is not specific to any particular state of the reservoir , however , and may readily be applied to environments at finite temperature .",
    "it may be extended , moreover , to include driving forces , coupled oscillators and multiple reservoirs , with the latter perhaps being at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "this may provide some insights into important questions of principle in the nascent fields of quantum machines and quantum thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we return to these ideas elsewhere .",
    "the hamiltonian diagonalisation upon which much of this work is based was first calculated by bruno huttner , in collaboration with smb , 24 years ago in their work on the quantum electrodynamics of dielectric media .",
