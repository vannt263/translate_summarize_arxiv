    "in recent years , the experimental realization of landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) interferometry@xcite in several systems has emerged as a tool to study quantum coherence under strong driving .",
    "lzs interferometry is realized in two - level systems ( tls ) which are driven with a time periodic force .",
    "the periodic sweeps through an avoided crossing in the energy level spectrum result in successive landau - zener transitions .",
    "the accumulated phase between these repeated tunneling events gives place to constructive or destructive interferences , depending on the driving amplitude and the detuning from the avoided crossing .",
    "these lzs interferences have been observed in a variety of quantum systems , such as rydberg atoms,@xcite superconducting qubits,@xcite ultracold molecular gases,@xcite quantum dot devices,@xcite single spins in nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond,@xcite nanomechanical circuits,@xcite and ultracold atoms in accelerated optical lattices.@xcite several other related experimental and theoretical works have studied lzs interferometry in systems under different shapes of periodic driving,@xcite in two coupled qubits,@xcite in optomechanical systems,@xcite and the effect of a geometric phase.@xcite furthermore , experiments in superconducting flux qubits under strong driving have allowed to extend lzs interferometry beyond two levels.@xcite in this later case , the multi - level structure of the flux qubit , with several different avoided crossings in the energy spectrum , exhibited a series of diamond - like interference patterns as a function of dc flux detuning and microwave amplitude.@xcite    driven two - level systems have been extensively studied theoretically in the past . under strong time - periodic driving fields , phenomena such as coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) @xcite and multiphoton resonances @xcite",
    "have been analyzed .",
    "the influence of the environment has been studied within the driven spin - boson model,@xcite applying various techniques like the path - integral formalism,@xcite or the solution of the time dependent equations for the populations of the density matrix,@xcite either as an integro - differential kinetic equation,@xcite or considering for weak coupling the underlying bloch - redfield equations,@xcite or using the decomposition of the quantum master equation into floquet states,@xcite or performing a rotating - wave approximation.@xcite however , the theoretical results for driven tls in contact with a quantum bath @xcite present some discrepancies with the experiments of lzs interferometry , particularly in the flux qubit.@xcite in fact , these works typically predict population inversion,@xcite which has not been observed in the experiments of ref .  . in a recent work",
    "we showed,@xcite that for the case of a non - resonant detuning , population inversion arises for very long driving times and it is mediated by a slow mechanism of interactions with the bath .",
    "this long - time asymptotic regime was not reached in the experiment .    here , we will study in full detail the lzs interference patterns of the flux qubit , by considering the dependence with dc flux detuning in addition to the dependence with microwave amplitude . to this end , we calculate numerically the finite time and the asymptotic stationary population of the qubit states using the floquet - markov approach,@xcite solving a realistic model of the flux qubit in contact with an ohmic quantum bath . for the time scale of the experiments we find a very good agreement with the diamond patterns of ref .. for longer time scales ,",
    "we find a dynamic transition within the first diamond ( which corresponds to the two level regime ) , manifested by a symmetry change in the structure of the lzs interference pattern .",
    "we also consider the case of an structured quantum bath , which can be due to a squid detector with a resonant plasma frequency @xmath0 .",
    "different types of lzs interference patterns can arise in this case , depending on the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
