    "tau leptons are an excellent signature with which to probe new physics at the lhc . as the heaviest leptons",
    ", they have the largest coupling to the higgs boson both in the standard model ( sm ) and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . their short - enough lifetime and parity - violating decays allow for their spin information to be preserved in the decay product kinematics recorded in the detector .",
    "they are therefore the only leptons suitable for measuring longitudinal polarization and its correlations , which provide important constraints on the nature of the observed resonance .    in this note",
    "we present a tauspinner package , which is a mc program designed to generate tau spin effects in _ any _ tau sample provided their origin is known .",

    "omission of the last step leaves    the kinematics of the tau decay particle different from what is    expected from the polarized taus that appear in nature .",

    "it is also key for measurements of    tau polarization and tau spin correlations .",
    "the tauspinner algorithm    allows one to create samples with different tau polarizations from an    initial sample by re - weighting events to give the desired    distributions as a function of the decay mode of the tau .",

    "<S> it relies on the availability of the four - momenta of the taus and their decay products in the analyzed data . </S>",
    "<S> the flavor and the four - momentum of the boson decaying to the @xmath0  or @xmath1  pair need to be known . in the @xmath2  case </S>",
    "<S> the initial state quark configuration is attributed from the intermediate boson kinematics , and the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) . </S>",
    "<S> tauspinner is the first algorithm suitable for emulation of tau spin effects in tau - embedded samples . </S>",
    "<S> it is also the first tool that offers the user the flexibility to simulate a desired spin effect at the analysis level . </S>",
    "<S> an algorithm to attribute tau helicity states to a previously generated sample is also provided .    </S>",
