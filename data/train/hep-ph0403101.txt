    "field theoretical systems which are a long way from thermal equilibrium have been studied intensely in recent years .",
    "the particular problem of how and when such systems approach equilibrium stretches beyond obvious fundamental interest and finds many practical applications . in high - energy physics understanding of these processes",
    "is crucial for applications to heavy ion collisions and to cosmology of the early universe .",
    "the first topic gains further importance in light of the current and future experimental search for a quark - gluon - plasma at rhic and at the forthcoming lhc .",
    "the second application , our main interest in this paper , is related to the problem of reheating of the universe after cosmological inflation .",
    "inflation provides a solution to the flatness and the horizon problems of standard cosmology @xcite and explains the generation of initial density perturbations - the seeds of galaxies and large - scale structure in our universe . during inflation the universe is in a vacuum - like state . at the end of inflation all energy density is stored in a bose condensate , the coherently oscillating `` inflaton '' field .",
    "this state is highly unstable : parametric , tachyonic or strong non - adiabatic particle creation triggers a fast and explosive decay of the inflaton .",
    "this process , dubbed preheating @xcite , is currently well understood @xcite .",
    "a generic feature is a strong and fast amplification of fluctuation fields at low momenta , which may lead to various interesting physical effects during and after preheating . these include non - thermal phase transitions @xcite with possible formation of topological defects @xcite , creation of super - heavy particles @xcite , generation of high - frequency gravitational waves @xcite , etc .",
    "the explosive stage of inflaton decay ends when the rate of interactions of created fluctuations among themselves and with the inflaton becomes comparable to the inflaton decay rate @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the subsequent stages of relaxation towards equilibrium , of the thermalization processes and the calculation of the final equilibrium temperature is important for various applications as it links the inflationary phase with that of standard cosmology . among those one",
    "can list baryogenesis @xcite and the problem of over - abundant gravitino production in supergravity models @xcite .",
    "it determines the abundances of other relics , like super - heavy dark matter @xcite , or axino dark matter @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the reheating temperature is also important for fixing constraints on the inflationary model from cosmic microwave background ( cmbr ) anisotropy @xcite . in some models",
    "cosmologically important curvature perturbations may be even generated during the process of thermalization @xcite .",
    "last but not least : the reheating temperature should be larger than about one gev to ensure that the standard big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite is not hampered .",
    "there have been many efforts and successes in the understanding of the non - equilibrium dynamics and relaxation of field theories , see e.g. refs .",
    "however , the leading asymptotic dynamics towards equilibrium remained rather less understood and developed .",
    "the main problem for the theoretical understanding of reheating is that initially the occupation numbers are very large , of order of the inverse coupling constant .",
    "in addition , in many inflationary models the zero mode does not decay completely during preheating .",
    "therefore , a simple perturbative approach is not justified . on the other hand , in this regime ,",
    "a description in terms of classical field theory is valid @xcite , and the whole process ( including preheating ) , can be studied by classical lattice simulations .",
    "recently , we employed this method to show @xcite that the classical reheating of a massless @xmath0-theory in 3 + 1 dimensions is characterized by a _",
    "turbulent _ and _ self - similar _ evolution of distribution functions towards equilibrium .",
    "the shape of the spectra , as well as the self - similar dynamics , could be understood within the framework of wave kinetic theory .",
    "this made it possible to estimate reheating time and temperature , which turned out to coincide parametrically with the results of the simple perturbative approach .",
    "turbulence appears in a large variety of non - equilibrium - phenomena in nature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a general introduction ) .",
    "it was first discussed for fluids , in the regime of large reynolds numbers ( velocities ) , where viscosity is subdominant .",
    "kolmogorov identified turbulence in this regime @xcite as a statistically scale invariant flow of spectral energy mediated by vortex interactions .",
    "the same dynamical structure may appear in systems of coupled waves , e.g. on fluid surfaces or for coupled fields in a plasma @xcite . in this case",
    "the cascade is mediated by wave interactions and the phenomenon has been called _",
    "wave turbulence_.    if there exists an active ( stationary ) source of energy in momentum space , the turbulence is called _ driven _",
    "( stationary ) .",
    "when the source is switched off after the stage of activity , the freely propagating energy cascade is often referred to as _ free _ turbulence .",
    "if the kinetic description is applicable , the energy cascade is called _",
    "weak turbulence_. otherwise one is facing a _",
    "strong turbulence_.    one may expect that the concept of turbulence should be relevant for the problem of reheating @xcite already on general grounds .",
    "indeed , the source of energy , localized in the `` infra - red '' is present initially .",
    "it is represented by the inflaton field in the problem at hands . to complete the argument",
    ", we note that as the final outcome of the evolution one should expect cascading of energy towards a significantly separated region of `` ultra - violet '' , high momentum modes .",
    "the goal of the current paper is twofold .",
    "first , we want to apply the wave kinetic theory of turbulence to the problem of universe reheating after inflation .",
    "we derive general formulas for the spectra of turbulent distributions and for the self - similar evolution towards equilibrium .",
    "this enables us to give asymptotic estimates of reheating time and temperature in minkowski space as well as in friedmann universe .",
    "second , we want to test and confront these ideas to numerical lattice calculations . for our numerical integrations",
    "we have chosen the simplest `` chaotic '' inflationary model @xcite . while the initial `` preheating '' stage in other inflationary models , e.g. in hybrid inflation @xcite may exhibit important differences @xcite with this model , we expect the subsequent turbulent stages to be more universal .",
    "we start lattice integration from `` vacuum '' initial conditions for fluctuations in a background of classical oscillating inflaton field .",
    "we observe the initial parametric resonance stage when the energy in fluctuations is growing exponentially with time .",
    "this stage terminates when re - scattering of waves out of the resonance band becomes important @xcite . in the physically relevant case of sufficiently large couplings",
    "this happens rather early , when only a small fraction of initial inflaton energy is transferred to fluctuations @xcite . at this point a state of stationary turbulence",
    "should be established that is driven by the zero - mode .",
    "on general grounds , it can be deduced that during this stage the energy in fluctuations should grow linearly with time .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "the stage of stationary turbulence should terminate when the energy left out in the zero - mode becomes smaller than the energy stored in created `` particles '' . from this moment of time , the transport of energy from the source is negligible and we observe free turbulence with self - similar evolution of particle distributions towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "the first stage of driven turbulence is prompt and gives the main mechanism by which energy is drawn out of the zero - mode , e.g. out of the inflaton field .",
    "the identification of this constitutes one of the new results of the present paper , as opposed to the common opinion that the main mechanism is a `` parametric resonance  .",
    "the second stage of free turbulence is very long and can be analytically described as self - similar evolution .",
    "this is another new result and diffuses some existing claims and hopes that ' ' parametric resonance \" may bring a system to thermal equilibrium on a very short time scale .",
    "overall , the kinetic description and the results of lattice simulations are in rather good agreement with each other .",
    "this indicates that the regime of weak wave turbulence may be already achieved on the lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ numsim : one - field ]",
    "we review the results of our numerical simulation of reheating in the simplest @xmath1 model to get familiar with concepts , problems and the typical dynamical behavior of the systems of interest . in sections",

    "we review the derivation of the kinetic equation for a system of weakly interacting classical waves .",

    "the results were already briefly reported in ref .",
    "the numerical procedure itself is described in appendix [ numericalprocedure ] . at the end of the section",
    "we will discuss some expected differences with more complicated models .",
    "this order of presentation allows us to introduce the typical behavior in the systems under consideration and to formulate concepts and problems",
    ". this will be useful in the discussion of the general theory of turbulent thermalization , which we carry out in the following section .",
    "further numerical results , obtained for the simplest @xmath2 model , and numerical results obtained for more complicated multi - field systems , will be presented in sections  [ twofields ] and  [ complatt2kin ] .      in this simple model ,",
    "the field @xmath4 is the only dynamical variable .",
    "its initial homogeneous mode drives inflation , while development and growth of fluctuations on sub - horizon scales at the end of inflation can be viewed as a simple model of reheating .",
    "inflation ends when the motion of the homogeneous mode of the field changes from the regime of `` slow - roll '' to the regime of oscillations .",
    "it is convenient to work in conformal coordinates where the metric takes the form @xmath5 we choose the case of a massless field where the equation of motion for the rescaled field @xmath6 after inflation is the same as in flat space - time @xmath7 therefore , all results obtained in this model are equally applicable to the reheating of the universe after inflation and to modeling of other processes of thermalization in relativistic systems , say , after heavy ion collisions .",
    "the homogeneous component of the field , which corresponds to the zero momentum in the fourier decomposition , @xmath8 , is usually referred to as the `` zero - mode . ''",
    "it is convenient to make a rescaling of the field , @xmath9 , and of the space - time coordinates , @xmath10 .",

    "the physical normalization of the inflationary model corresponds to a dimensionful initial amplitude of @xmath16 and a coupling constant @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the re - parameterization property of the system allows to choose a larger value of @xmath15 for numerical simulations .",

    "we will discuss the zero mode , @xmath19 , the variance , @xmath20 and `` particle occupation '' numbers .",

    "we begin the discussion of our numerical results with the evolution of the zero - mode and the variance of the field , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ spat_av ] .",
    "the zero mode is a rapidly oscillating function on the time scale of our lattice calculation . in fig .",

    ", width=364 ]    the initial fast transfer of the zero - mode energy into fluctuations during preheating ( up to @xmath22 ) is followed by a long and slow relaxation phase . in this late time",
    "regime the amplitude of the zero mode oscillations decreases according to @xmath23 with @xmath24 , the variance of the field ( averaged over high - frequency oscillations ) drops according to @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we find that in this regime the zero - mode is in a non - trivial dynamical equilibrium with the bath of highly occupied modes : when the zero - mode is artificially removed , it is recreated on a short time - scale ( bose condensation ) .",
    "a detailed analytical discussion of the initial linear stage of the parametric resonance in this model can be found e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . during this stage",
    "the occupation numbers grow exponentially with time in a narrow band of resonance momenta .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the occupation numbers at different moments of time .",
    "the displayed spectrum at time @xmath27 corresponds to the stage of parametric resonance .",
    "the resonance peak is located at the theoretically predicted value of @xmath28 @xcite . at later time",
    ", the growth of the resonance peak is stopped by re - scattering of particles out of the resonance band , which leads to a broadening of the occupied region and to the appearance of multiple peaks @xcite of comparable width , see spectrum at @xmath29 .",
    "this structure fits estimates for the development of turbulence in the presence of a narrow width source located at a finite @xmath30 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . at even later times",
    "the spectra have become smooth because of re - scattering , and only the first peak is still visible as a small bump . with time , its position moves towards smaller momenta , reflecting the change in the effective frequency of inflaton oscillations .",
    "however , if the particle momenta are rescaled by the current amplitude @xmath31 of the zero mode oscillations , as in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , the position of the resonance is approximately unchanged .",
    "particles with small momenta are distributed according to a power law , which at larger momenta is bounded by a cut - off .",
    "the position of this cut - off moves with time to the `` ultra - violet '' .",
    "this reflects a general tendency of the system to thermal equilibrium .",

    "[ self_sim],width=374 ]    this stage of evolution ( @xmath33 ) has the following characteristic features :    1 .",
    "the system overall is statistically close to a gaussian distribution of field amplitudes and conjugated momenta @xcite .",
    "2 .   the spectra in the dynamically important region can be described by a power law , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the system is not in a thermal equilibrium which would correspond to @xmath36 .",
    "rather , the exponent of particle distributions in the power law region corresponds to kolmogorov turbulence @xcite .",
    "the power law is followed by a cut - off at higher @xmath30 .",
    "energy accumulated in particles is concentrated in the region were the cut - off starts .",
    "its position is monotonously growing toward the ultra - violet , reflecting the evolution towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "this motion can be described as a self - similar evolution @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is some ( arbitrary ) late - time moment .",
    "the best numerical fit corresponds to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and is presented in fig .",
    "[ self_sim ] .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath42 is of prime interest since it determines the rate with which system approaches equilibrium .",
    "the first and the second point in this list facilitate the use of wave kinetic theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , a straightforward application is difficult and may be even inappropriate , at least at the early re - scattering stages , because of the following :    1 .",
    "the zero mode does not decay completely .",
    "it may induce `` anomalous '' terms in the collision integral , which are absent in the usual kinetic description .",
    "2 .   the occupation numbers are large initially , of order of the inverse coupling constant , @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "therefore , in addition to lowest order collisions ( e.g. scattering of two particles into two particles with different momenta ) , multi - particle collisions may be dynamically important as well .",
    "therefore , precise lattice calculations are needed . on the other hand",
    ", they have a limited dynamical range in momenta and in time , and one has to switch to a kinetic approach at some later stage . to determine when ( and",
    "if ) this is possible , the results obtained with the use of a simple kinetic approach should be confronted with the lattice results .    in the following sections we will develop and apply the theory of weak wave turbulence to the models of the type integrated on the lattice .",
    "in particular , we will calculate all universal scaling exponents and show that they are in agreement with lattice results . at `` early '' times",
    "the dynamics of the model described above is driven by @xmath44-particle interactions with @xmath45 .",
    "wave turbulence theory gives for scaling exponents in @xmath46 spatial dimensions : @xmath47      the flux of energy over momentum space , which is necessarily present in problems like reheating and thermalization after inflation , signifies that we should observe a turbulent state during the thermalization stage and that the theory of turbulence applies . in a simple @xmath48 model the stage of preheating ( i.e. parametric resonance ) ends when roughly half of the inflaton energy is transferred to particles .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ spat_av ] shows that the amplitude of the zero mode , which is a source of energy for the turbulence problem , starts to decrease already at the end of the parametric resonance stage . in such system",
    "we expect the free turbulence regime to follow the preheating stage .    in more complicated systems , which involve other fields",
    "coupled to the inflaton , say , some field @xmath49 , parametric resonance may end when the fraction of energy transferred to the @xmath49 excitations is still negligible compared to the energy stored in the inflaton zero mode .",
    "indeed , parametric resonance ends when the rate of re - scattering of particles out of the resonance band became comparable to the resonant production rate and the maximal value of the variance of @xmath49 excitations achieved at the end of the resonance stage is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is either the coupling of @xmath49 to the inflaton , or self - coupling of @xmath49 ( viz . , the largest of these two ) .",
    "we expect that in this case turbulent transport will develop when the amplitude of the inflaton zero mode is still unchanging . this means , that the transfer of zero mode energy into @xmath49-filed should occur in the regime of stationary turbulence .",
    "only when the amount of energy in the zero - mode becomes subdominant we should expect a transition to the regime of free turbulence .",
    "this is an important difference to the simple @xmath52-model .",
    "in particular , the distribution functions move much faster into the ultra - violet in this regime , @xmath53 .",
    "we will see that the regime of stationary turbulence is indeed present in two field models , see section  [ twofields ] .",
    "kolmogorov s turbulence is characterized by a stationary transport of some conserved quantity between different scales in momentum ( fourier ) space @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to systems with spatially isotropic and homogeneous correlation functions , which applies to the cosmological conditions after inflation .",
    "turbulence usually appears when a source of energy or particles is present and is localized in some momentum region @xmath54 .",
    "in addition to the source exists a `` sink '' localized at @xmath55 . when both , source and sink are stationary , it is natural to expect the eventual development of a stationary state with scale independent transport of the conserved quantity through momentum space .",
    "indeed , energy or particle number can not accumulate between @xmath54 and @xmath55 and should flow from one scale to the other .",
    "this is a system - independent formulation of kolmogorov s concept of turbulence , which he formulated in the context of hydrodynamical systems @xcite .",
    "zakharov applied it to systems of coupled waves @xcite in the regime of kinetic wave interactions .",
    "his approach is based on his derivation of the wave kinetic equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and is well suited to studies of turbulence in classical field theories .",
    "we will adopt it here .",
    "the physical scenario of reheating after inflation shares basic ingredients with that of turbulence : there exists a localized source of energy- the coherently oscillating inflaton zero - mode - pumping energy into the system of particles at fourier wave - numbers @xmath56 .",
    "the mechanism behind this pumping can be parametric resonance , tachyonic amplification , etc . like in the turbulent scenario there do not exist other intermediate scales ( wave - numbers ) , where energy is infused , accumulated , or dissipated .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the eventual dynamics of reheating - after the explosive regime of preheating has ended - is close to that of kolmogorov s turbulence .    however , in the description of reheating appear some differences to stationary turbulence , since :    1 .   a sink does not exists .",
    "the source ( i.e. the amplitude of inflaton zero - mode oscillations and therefore interaction rates ) can be essentially time - dependent on relevant time scales .",
    "neither source nor sink exist when the inflaton has completely decayed .    in the first case , we expect that the stationary turbulent flux of energy still will be established in some `` inertial '' range @xmath57 .",
    "particle distributions in this range of momenta should not be significantly different compared to the case with a stationary sink .",
    "indeed , in the typical turbulent problem the energy dissipates ( e.g. into heat ) after entering the region @xmath58 . for problems relevant to thermalization after inflation , instead of dissipation",
    "the transported energy is used to populate high momentum modes at @xmath59 .",
    "if the transport is reasonably `` local '' in momentum space , the flux of energy through the inertial range should not be influenced much by processes which involve @xmath60 .",
    "energy may dissipate at @xmath55 or continue the flow to even higher momenta , but regardless of this , we should expect the same distribution of particles in the inertial range .",
    "however , in the latter case we can expect that the value of @xmath55 increases , and since the flux of energy is constant throughout inertial range , the total energy of a system without a sink has to grow linearly with time , @xmath61 this is a simple consequence of the stationarity of turbulence in the inertial range , and can be used as its signature .    a time dependent source ( second point above )",
    "changes the picture somewhat , since stationary states are not likely to develop even in a finite range of @xmath30 .",
    "however , a weak time - dependence should still allow for a close - to - stationary and close - to - turbulent evolution .",
    "moreover , even if the source eventually does not exists , particle distributions in the inertial range as functions of momenta can still be close to turbulent power laws .",
    "indeed , stationary turbulent distributions can be found as zeros of the collision integral @xcite . in the non - stationary case",
    "the collision integral is non - zero , but should approach a minimal value in the inertial range which may result in the same shape of particle distributions there .      the dynamics of coupled waves close to a stationary state can be described by a wave kinetic equation ( see e.g. refs .",

    "we have shown that the process of relaxation in such systems can be divided , in the general case , into three distinct stages .    in the models of the type we have considered in this paper , the initial stage of preheating @xcite",

    "however , in the physical situation of reheating after inflation , the coupling constants have to be sufficiently large to insure an acceptably short time - scale of the subsequent thermalization , while with large couplings , only a negligible fraction of the initial inflaton energy is transfered into fluctuations during the parametric resonance stage @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in such situations the linear stage is followed by the regime of a _ driven stationary turbulence_. during this stage , the energy in particles grows linearly in time .",
    "the regime of stationary turbulence stops as soon as the energy in particles starts to dominate the overall energy balance .",

    "<S> we study , analytically and with lattice simulations , the decay of coherent field oscillations and the subsequent thermalization of the resulting stochastic classical wave - field . the problem of reheating of the universe after inflation constitutes our prime motivation and application of the results . </S>",
    "<S> we identify three different stages of these processes . during the initial stage of `` parametric resonance '' , only a small fraction of the initial inflaton energy is transferred to fluctuations in the physically relevant case of sufficiently large couplings . </S>",
    "<S> a major fraction is transfered in the prompt regime of driven turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent long stage of thermalization classifies as free turbulence . during the turbulent stages , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of particle distribution functions is self - similar . </S>",
    "<S> we show that wave kinetic theory successfully describes the late stages of our lattice calculation . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results are general and give estimates of reheating time and temperature in terms of coupling constants and initial inflaton amplitude . </S>"
