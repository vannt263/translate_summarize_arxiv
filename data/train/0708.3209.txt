    "the case @xmath150 is special : @xmath212 . in this case , the light ray emitted by the star at @xmath213 coincides with the asymptote of the observer s world line , so that the observer can keep track of the star s destiny up to @xmath214 , which is exactly the time when the observer began to accelerate .",
    "applying the concept of the _ rindler horizon _ to our problem reveals further interesting aspects and connections between our results and the underlying spacetime geometry .",
    "the rindler horizon of an event is defined as the future null cone of that event ; the chronological future of the event ( which is the interior of the null cone ) is said to lie within the rindler horizon .",
    "communication between the inside and the outside is only one - way , since events within the rindler horizon can not have any influence on events outside . in order to observe a particular event",

    "let us consider the rindler horizon of the event @xmath215 , i.e. , the star at time @xmath15 .",
    "( this event is simultaneous with the event marking the beginning of the accelerating of the observer ; this is true w.r.t .  to both the local rest systems at hand .",
    ") if the acceleration is such that @xmath124 , the world line of the observer is entirely outside of ( a subset of ) the rindler horizon , see figures  [ rh2 ] and  [ rh3 ] . in the special case @xmath150 , the observer s null asymptote coincides with the horizon .",
    "accordingly , the observer is unable to observe the event @xmath216 ; the observer `` flees the scene '' so quickly as to leave the `` light behind him '' ( i.e. , the light emitted by the star at the time of departure ) . in contrast , if the acceleration is small , i.e. , if @xmath121 , the observer passes through the rindler horizon , see figure  [ rh1 ] .",
    "it can be shown that the ( proper ) time at which the observer intersects the rindler horizon is intimately connected with the time @xmath217 , where the apex angle @xmath2 assumes its maximum @xmath130 .",
    "( in fact , if we considered the simpler geometry of a luminous rod instead of a luminous ball , the proper time at which @xmath10 passes through the rindler horizon is exactly @xmath141 . )    summing up we see that several of the properties and results derived analytically in this paper directly correspond to geometric properties of the problem .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the aberration of light in the case where the source is a spherical object ( like a star ) .",
    "a useful problem to consider ( e.g. , in the context of a course on special relativity ) is the case of a luminous rod or the case of two point sources at a given distance , where the observer is assumed to move in a direction perpendicular to the rod ( or the line connecting the two stars ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the effects of the aberration of light for a uniformly accelerating observer . </S>",
    "<S> the observer we consider is initially at rest with respect to a luminous spherical object  a star , say  and then starts to move away with constant acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the main results we derive are the following : ( i ) the observer always sees an initial increase of the apparent size of the object ; ( ii ) the apparent size of the object approaches a non - zero value as the proper time of the observer goes to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) there exists a critical value of the acceleration such that the apparent size of the object is always increasing when the acceleration is super - critical . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , while ( i ) is a purely non - relativistic effect , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are effects of the relativistic aberration of light and are intimately connected with the lorentzian geometry of minkowksi spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the examples we present illustrate that , while more or less negligible in everyday life , the three effects can be significant in the context of space - flight . </S>"
