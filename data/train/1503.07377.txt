    "the improved infrastructure and an increase in the adoption of cyber - technology have led to increased connection and ease of interaction for users across the globe . however , at the same time , these developments have increased users exposure to risk .",
    "the importance of investing in security measures in this developing landscape is two - fold : while such expenditure helps entities protect their assets against security threats , by association it also benefits other interacting users , as an investing entity is less likely to be infected and used as a source of future attacks . in other words , a users expenditure in security in an interconnected system provides _ positive externalities _ to other users .",
    "consequently , the provision of security is often studied as a problem of public good provision . in particular ,",
    "when users are rational , the strategic decision making process leading to security investment decisions is studied as an _ ( interdependent ) security game _ @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that in an unregulated environment , the provision of public goods is in general inefficient @xcite . to eliminate this inefficiency ,",
    "the literature has proposed regulating mechanisms for implementing the socially optimal levels of security in these games , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "specifically , examples of existing mechanisms in the literature include introducing subsidies and fines based on security investments @xcite , assessing rebates and penalties based on security outcomes @xcite , imposing a level of due care and establishing liability rules @xcite , etc .",
    "our focus in the current paper is on mechanisms that use monetary payments / rewards to incentivize improved security behavior . within this context",
    ", we will examine two incentive mechanisms , namely the _",
    "@xcite and _ externality _ @xcite mechanisms , both of which induce socially optimal user behavior by levying a monetary tax on each user participating in the proposed mechanism .    aside from inducing optimal behavior , incentive mechanisms are often designed so as to maintain a _ ( weakly ) balanced budget ( bb ) _ and ensure _ voluntary participation ( vp ) _ by all users . the budget balance requirement states that the designer of the mechanism prefers to redistribute users payments as rewards , and ideally to either",
    "retain a surplus as profit or at least to not sustain losses .",
    "otherwise , the designer would need to spend external resources to achieve social optimality .",
    "the voluntary participation constraint on the other hand ensures that all users voluntarily take part in the proposed mechanism and the induced game , and prefer its outcome to that attained if they unilaterally decide to opt out of the mechanism .",
    "a user s decision when contemplating participation in an incentive mechanism is dependent not only on the structure of the game induced by the mechanism , but also on the options available when staying out .",
    "the latter is what sets the study of incentive mechanisms for security games apart from other public good problems where similar pivotal and externality mechanisms have been applied , e.g. , @xcite .    to elaborate on this underlying difference",
    ", we note that security is a _ non - excludable _ public good .",
    "that is , although the mechanism optimizes the investments in a way that participating users are exposed to lower risks , those who stay out of the mechanism can benefit from the externalities of such improved state of security as well .",
    "the availability of these spill - overs in turn limits users willingness to pay for the good or their interest in improving their actions .",
    "in contrast , with excludable public goods , e.g. transmission power allocated in a communication system @xcite , users willingness to participate is determined by the change in their utilities when contributing and receiving the good , as compared to receiving _ no allocation at all_. this means that the designer has the ability to collect more taxes and require a higher level of contribution when providing an excludable good . as a result , tax - based mechanisms , such as the externality mechanism",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) and the pivotal mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) , can be designed so as to incentivize the socially optimal provision of an excludable good , guarantee voluntary participation , and maintain ( weak ) budget balance .    however , in this paper we show that given the non - excludable nature of security , there is no reliable tax - based mechanism that can achieve social optimality , voluntary participation , and ( weak ) budget balance simultaneously in all instances of security games .",
    "we show this result through two sets of counter - examples : we first limit the network structure to a star topology , and then consider the commonly studied weakest link model for users risk functions .",
    "we then further elaborate on this particular nature of security games by examining the pivotal and externality mechanisms in the special case of a _ weighted total effort _ interdependence model .",
    "this interdependence model is of particular interest as it can capture varying degrees and possible asymmetries in the influence of users security decisions on one another .",
    "specifically , we evaluate the effects of : ( i ) increasing users self - dependence ( equivalently , decreasing their interdependence ) , ( ii ) having two diverse classes of self - dependent and reliant users , and ( iii ) presence of a single dominant user , on the performance of the pivotal and externality mechanisms .",
    "we show that when possible , the selection of equilibria that are less beneficial to the outliers helps the performance of both mechanisms , so that they can achieve optimality , budget balance , and voluntary participation simultaneously .",
    "in addition , we see that these incentive mechanisms become of interest when they can facilitate a tax - transfer scheme , such that users who are highly dependent on externalities pay to incentivize improved investments by others who are key to improving the state of security .",
    "the main findings of this work can therefore be summarized as follows .",
    "first , we show that there is no tax - based incentive mechanism that can simultaneously guarantee social optimality , voluntary participation , and weak budget balance in all instances of security games .",
    "this result is applicable to other problems concerning the provision of non - excludable public goods over social and economic networks as well ( see section [ sec : related ] ) .",
    "second , we provide further insight on this impossibility by evaluating two incentive mechanisms , namely the pivotal and externality mechanisms , in weighted total effort games . we identify some of the parameters affecting the performance of these mechanisms , and instances in which the implementation of each mechanism is of interest .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the model for security games , as well as the pivotal and externality mechanisms , in section [ sec : model ] , followed by the general impossibility result in section [ sec : imp ] .",
    "section [ sec : sim ] illustrates this result by applying the pivotal and externality mechanisms to weighted total effort models .",
    "we summarize related work in section [ sec : related ] , and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 interdependent users . each user @xmath1 can choose to exert effort towards securing its system , consequently achieving the _ level of security _ or _ level of investment _ @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the _ state of security _ of the system , i.e. , the profile of security levels of all @xmath0 users .",
    "we let @xmath4 denote the _ investment cost function _ of user @xmath1 ; it determines the monetary expenditure required to implement a level of security @xmath5 .",
    "we assume this function is continuous , increasing , and convex .",
    "the assumption of convexity entails that security measures get increasingly costly as their effectiveness increases .",
    "the expected amount of assets user @xmath1 has subject to loss , given the state of security @xmath6 , is determined by the _ risk function _ , and is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we assume @xmath8 is continuous , non - increasing , and strictly convex , in all arguments @xmath9 . the non - increasing nature of this function in arguments @xmath10 , models the positive externality of users security decisions on one another .",
    "the convexity on the other hand implies that the effectiveness of security measures in preventing attacks ( or the marginal utility ) is overall decreasing , as none of the available security measure can guarantee the prevention of all possible attacks",
    ".    a user @xmath1 s _ ( security ) cost function _ at a state of security @xmath6 is therefore given by : @xmath11    we refer to the one - stage , full information game among the @xmath0 utility maximizing users with utility functions @xmath12 as the security game .",
    "the level of investments in the nash equilibrium of these games , and their sub - optimality when compared to the socially optimal investments , has been extensively studied in the literature , see e.g. @xcite . here , the socially optimal investment levels @xmath13 are those maximizing the total welfare , or equivalently , minimizing the sum of all users costs , i.e. , @xmath14 the literature has further proposed mechanisms for decreasing the inefficiency gap in security games , by either incentivizing or dictating improved security investments ; see @xcite for a survey .",
    "our focus in the present paper is on regulating mechanisms that use monetary taxation to incentivize socially optimal security behavior .",
    "such mechanisms assess a tax @xmath15 on each user @xmath1 ; this tax may be positive , negative , or zero , indicating payments , rewards , or no transaction , respectively .",
    "we further assume that users utilities are quasi - linear .",
    "therefore , the _ total cost _ of a user @xmath1 when it is assigned a tax @xmath15 is given by : @xmath16    in addition to implementing the socially optimal solution , incentive mechanisms are often required to satisfy two desirable properties .",
    "first , when using taxation , the mechanism designer prefers to maintain _",
    "( weak ) budget balance ( bb ) _ ; i.e. , it is desirable to have @xmath17 . in particular",
    ", @xmath18 implies a budget deficit , such that the implementation of the mechanism would call for the injection of additional resources by the designer .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to design the mechanism in a way that users _ voluntary participation ( vp ) _ conditions are satisfied ; i.e. users prefer implementing the socially optimal outcome while being assigned taxes @xmath15 , to the outcome attained had they unilaterally opted out .",
    "otherwise , the designer would need to enforce initial cooperation in the mechanism .",
    "note that we focus on the notion of voluntary participation instead of the usual _ individual rationality ( ir ) _ constraint , which requires a user to prefer participation to the outcome it attained at the state of anarchy ( i.e. , prior to the implementation of the mechanism ) . as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , such distinction is important as security is a non - excludable public good , i.e. , users can still benefit from the externalities of the actions of users participating in the mechanism , even when opting out themselves .",
    "this is in contrast to games with excludable public goods , where vp and ir are equivalent .",
    "we now proceed to introduce the pivotal and externality tax - based incentive mechanisms for security games .      groves mechanisms @xcite , also commonly known as vickery - clarke - groves ( vcg ) mechanisms , refer to a family of mechanisms in which , through the appropriate design of taxes for users with quasi - linear utilities , a mechanism designer can incentivize users to reveal their true preferences in dominant strategies , thus implementing the socially optimal solution .",
    "however , the ( weak ) budget balance and voluntary participation conditions do not necessarily hold in these mechanisms , and are further dependent on the specifics of the design , as well as the game environment",
    ".    in general , let @xmath19 be user @xmath1 s utility .",
    "here , @xmath20 is user @xmath1 s type ; a user s type determines the preference of the user over possible outcomes . in security games ,",
    "a user @xmath1 s type is its risk and investment cost functions @xmath21 , or equivalently , its cost function @xmath22 .",
    "users are required to report their types to the mechanism designer , based on which the designer decides on an allocation @xmath23 . in security games , an allocation is the vector of investments @xmath6 prescribed by the mechanism .",
    "the vcg family of mechanisms achieve truth revelation and efficiency by assigning the following taxes to users , when their reported types are @xmath24 : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the socially optimal allocation given users reported types , and @xmath27 is an arbitrary function that depends on the reported types of users other than @xmath1 .",
    "any choice of this function results in truth revelation and a socially efficient outcome , and a careful design may further result in vp and/or ( w)bb .",
    "one such choice that can achieve vp in certain environments is the _ pivotal _ , or _",
    ", mechanism @xcite , with taxes given by : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 , is the outcome maximizing the social welfare in the absence of user @xmath1 .",
    "this mechanism satisfies the participation constraints and achieves weak budget balance in many private and public good games @xcite ; however , this is not necessarily the case in security games .",
    "the taxes in the pivotal mechanism for the security game can be set as follows : @xmath30 where , @xmath31 is user @xmath1 s security cost function , @xmath32 is the socially optimal solution , and @xmath33 is the cost minimizing actions of users @xmath34 given user @xmath1 s action @xmath35 , and is determined by @xmath36 . in a game of complete information",
    ", @xmath37 will be the nash equilibrium of the game between user @xmath1 and the @xmath38 participating users .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that this design of the pivotal mechanism in security games internalizes the externalities of users actions , and can thus lead to the implementation of the socially optimal solution .",
    "formally ,    [ prop1 ] in the pivotal mechanism with taxes given by , investing the socially optimal level of investment @xmath39 will be individually optimal , for all users @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the socially optimal solution is implemented .",
    "furthermore , such design will ensure participation by all users .",
    "that is ,    [ prop2 ] the pivotal mechanism with taxes given by satisfies all voluntary participation constraints .",
    "the proofs of these propositions follow directly from existing literature , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we next examine a taxation mechanism that can achieve the socially optimal solution in security games , while maintaing a balanced budget .",
    "this mechanism is adapted from @xcite .",
    "the components of the mechanism are as follows .    _ the message space : _ each user @xmath1 provides a message @xmath40 to the mechanism designer .",
    "@xmath41 denotes user @xmath1 s proposal on the public good , i.e. , it proposes the amount of security investment to be made by everyone in the system , referred to as an _ investment profile_.    @xmath42 denotes a _ pricing profile _ which suggests the amount to be paid by everyone .",
    "as illustrated below , this is used by the designer to determine the taxes of all users .",
    "therefore , the pricing profile is user @xmath1 s proposal on the private good .    _",
    "the outcome function : _ the outcome function takes the message profiles @xmath43 as input , and determines the security investment profile @xmath44 and a tax profile @xmath45 as follows : @xmath46 in , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are treated as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "note that as @xmath51 by , the budget balance condition is satisfied through this construction .",
    "what this means is that the designer will not be spending resources or making profit , as the users whose tax @xmath52 is positive will be financing the rewards for those who have negative taxes . in other words ,",
    "the mechanism proposes a tax _ redistribution _ scheme to incentivize improved security investments .    to establish that the externality mechanism can implement the socially optimal outcome in security games , we first need to show that a profile @xmath53 , derived at any possible ne @xmath54 of the externality regulated game , is the socially optimal solution .",
    "formally ,    [ th1 ] let @xmath53 be the investment and tax profiles obtained at the nash equilibrium @xmath54 of the regulated security game .",
    "then , @xmath44 is the optimal solution to the centralized problem .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath55 is any other nash equilibrium of the proposed game , then @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we have to show the converse of the previous statement , i.e. , given an optimal investment profile , there exists an ne of externality regulated game which implements this solution .",
    "formally , we can show the following :    [ th2 ] let @xmath13 be the optimal investment profile in the solution to the centralized problem .",
    "then , there exists at least one nash equilibrium @xmath54 of the regulated security game such that @xmath57 .",
    "the proofs of these theorems follow the method used by @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to these papers , as well as our earlier work @xcite , where we present a sketch of the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , along with an intuitive interpretation for this mechanism . using the proof of [ th1 ]",
    ", we show that the tax terms @xmath58 at the equilibrium of the externality mechanism are given by : @xmath59 the interpretation is that by implementing this mechanism , each user @xmath1 will be financing part of user @xmath34 s reimbursement . according to , this amount is proportional to the positive externality of @xmath60 s investment on user @xmath1 s utility .",
    "in the previous section , we stated two well - known tax - based incentive mechanisms for incentivizing socially optimal actions , namely the pivotal and the externality mechanisms , in the context of security games .",
    "the pivotal mechanism is designed to guarantee voluntary participation , while the externality mechanism focuses on budget balance .",
    "following these observations , one may ask whether either of these schemes , or other tax - based mechanisms , can achieve social optimality , while guaranteeing both budget balance and voluntary participation simultaneously , in all instances of security games . in this section , we show that in fact no such reliable mechanism exists .",
    "we illustrate this impossibility through two families of counter - examples .",
    "the first counter - example considers games in which the network structure is a star topology , while the second family focuses on security games with weakest link risk functions .    in",
    "what follows , to evaluate users voluntary participation conditions , we consider a user @xmath1 , referred to as the _ loner _ or _",
    "outlier _ , who is unilaterally contemplating opting out of this mechanism .",
    "as the game considered here is one of full information , the remaining participating users , who are choosing a welfare maximizing solution for their ( @xmath38)-user system , will have the ability to predict the best - response of the loner to their collective action , and thus choose their investments accordingly . as a result , the equilibrium investment profile when user @xmath1 opts out is the nash equilibrium of the game between the @xmath38 participating users and this loner .",
    "we will henceforth refer to this equilibrium as the _ exit equilibrium _ ( ee ) .",
    "assume some tax - based incentive mechanism @xmath61 is proposed for security games .",
    "consider @xmath0 users connected through the star topology depicted in fig .",
    "[ ex : star ] , where the security decisions of the root affects all leaves , but each leaf s investment only affects itself and the root .",
    "formally , let the cost function of the root be given by : @xmath62 and that of all leaves @xmath63 be : @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is any function satisfying the assumptions in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the investment cost functions @xmath66 are linear , with the same unit investment cost @xmath67 for all users .",
    "\\(1 ) 1 child[norm ] node ( 2 ) 2 child[norm ] node ( 3 ) 3 child[ndots ] node ( a ) [ draw = none ] @xmath68 child[norm ] node ( n ) n ;    to find the socially optimal investment profile , we solve the optimization problem of minimizing the sum of all users costs , @xmath69 , subject to non - negative user investments .",
    "this profile , @xmath13 , should satisfy : @xmath70 based on the above , it is easy to see that in the socially optimal investment profile for this graph , only the root will be investing in security , while all leaves free - ride on the resulting externality .",
    "this socially optimal investment profile @xmath13 is given by : @xmath71    now , assume the root user is considering stepping out of the mechanism . to find the investment profile @xmath72 resulting from this unilateral deviation , first note that the leaves security decisions will not affect one another , so that the socially optimal investment profile for the @xmath38 leaves is the same as their individually optimal decisions .",
    "user 1 will also be choosing its individually optimal level of investment .",
    "therefore , using users first order conditions for cost minimization , the exit equilibrium @xmath72 is : @xmath73    finally , if any leaf user @xmath74 leaves the mechanism , the exit equilibrium @xmath75 will satisfy : @xmath76 again , it is easy to see that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , the exit equilibrium when user @xmath74 unilaterally leaves the mechanism is given by : @xmath78    we now use the socially optimal investment profile and the exit equilibria to evaluate voluntary participation and budget balance in a general mechanism @xmath61 .",
    "assume @xmath61 assigns a tax @xmath79 to a participating user @xmath1 .",
    "then , voluntary participation will hold if and only if @xmath80 , which reduces to : @xmath81 the sum of these taxes is thus bounded by : @xmath82 however , the above sum could be negative , e.g. , when @xmath83 or @xmath84 , indicating that weak budget balance will fail regardless of how the taxes are determined in a mechanism @xmath61 .      in this section , we again assume a general tax - based incentive mechanism @xmath61 is proposed for the security games .",
    "we focus on a family of security games which approximate the _",
    "weakest link _ risk function @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "intuitively , this model states that an attacker can compromise the security of an interconnected system by taking over the least protected node . to use this model in our current framework , we need a continuous , differentiable approximation of the minimum function .",
    "we use the approximation @xmath86 , where the accuracy of the approximation is increasing in the constant @xmath87 .",
    "user @xmath1 s cost function is thus given by : @xmath88 where investment cost functions @xmath66 are assumed to be linear , with the same unit investment cost @xmath67 for all users .    in this game , the socially optimal investment profile @xmath13 is given by the solution to the first order condition @xmath89 , which leads to : @xmath90 by symmetry , all users will be exerting the same socially optimal level of effort : @xmath91    next , assume a user @xmath1 unilaterally steps out of the mechanism , while the remaining users continue participating .",
    "the exit equilibrium profile @xmath37 can be determined using : @xmath92 solving the above , we get : @xmath93    we now use the socially optimal investment profile and the exit equilibria to analyze users participation incentives in a general mechanism @xmath61 , as well as the budget balance conditions .",
    "denote by @xmath79 the tax assigned to user @xmath1 by @xmath61 .",
    "a user @xmath1 s total cost functions when participating and staying out are given by : @xmath94 the voluntary participation condition for this user will hold if and only if @xmath95 , which reduces to : @xmath96 on the other hand , for weak budget balance to hold , we need @xmath97 .",
    "nevertheless , by , we have : @xmath98 it is easy to see that given @xmath99 and for any @xmath100 , the above sum will always be negative , indicating a budget deficit for a general mechanism @xmath61 , regardless of how taxes are determined . , the externality mechanism with taxes determined by will be budget balanced and guarantee voluntary participation .",
    "however , the pivotal mechanism will carry a deficit in both regions . ]      to close this section , we would like to point out that the impossibility result on a simultaneous guarantee of social optimality , voluntary participation , and weak budget balance , is demonstrated through two family of counter - examples .",
    "in other words , we have shown that without prior knowledge of the graph structure or users preferences , it is not possible for a designer to propose a _",
    "reliable _ mechanism ; that is , one which can promise to achieve so , vp , and wbb , regardless of the realizations of utilities .",
    "nevertheless , it may still be possible to design reliable mechanisms under a restricted space of problem parameters ; in fact we identify a few such instances in section [ sec : sim ] by analyzing the class of weighted total effort models .",
    "in the remainder of the paper , to further illustrate some of the parameters affecting the performance of incentive mechanisms in security games , we focus on the pivotal and externality mechanisms .",
    "we consider the special case of weighted total effort games , and identify some of the factors that affect the total budget and participation incentives in the pivotal and externality mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the gap between the nash equilibrium and the socially optimal investment profile of a security game , as well as users participation incentives and possible budget imbalances , are dependent on the specifics of the security cost functions defined in .",
    "in particular , an appropriate choice of the risk functions @xmath8 for a given game is based on factors such as the type of interconnection , the extent of interaction among users , and the type of attack .",
    "several models of security interdependency have been proposed and studied in the literature ; these include the _ total effort _ , _",
    "weakest link _ , and _",
    "best shot _ models considered in the seminal work of varian on security games @xcite , as well as the _ weakest target _ games proposed in @xcite , the _ effective investment _ and _ bad traffic _ models in @xcite , and the _ linear influence network _ games in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take the special case of the _ weighted total effort _ games , with exponential risks and linear investment cost functions , to study the effects of interdependency on the performance of the pivotal and externality mechanisms .",
    "formally , the total cost function of a user @xmath1 in this model is given by : @xmath101 here , the investment cost function is assumed linear , @xmath102 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath103 determine the dependence of user @xmath1 s risk on user @xmath60 s action .",
    "consequently , user @xmath1 s risk is dependent on a weighted sum of all users actions .    in particular , to isolate the effect of different features of the model on the performance of the two mechanisms , we focus on three sub - classes of the weighted total effort model .",
    "we first look at the effects of varying users self - dependence .",
    "next , we consider the effects of diversity , by breaking users into two groups of self - dependent and reliant users . finally , we study the effect of making all users increasingly dependent on a single node s action .",
    "we present numerical results and intuitive interpretation for each of the above scenarios ; formal analysis is given in the online appendix .",
    "consider a collection of @xmath0 users , with total cost functions determined according to , with @xmath104 , and @xmath105 : @xmath106 we assume @xmath107 , so as to ensure the existence of non - zero equilibria ; i.e. , at least one user exerts non - zero effort at any equilibrium of the game .",
    "the socially optimal and exit equilibria of this game can be determined by using the first order conditions on the users cost minimization problems , subject to non - negative investments .",
    "the resulting systems of equations can be solved to determine the possible exit equilibria , as well as parameter conditions under which each equilibrium happens ; the results are summarized in table [ t : vpbb_adiag ] . according to this table , we can identify five sets of parameter conditions under which different exit equilibria are possible . we can further analyze each case separately to find whether the voluntary participation conditions are satisfied under the externality mechanism , as well as whether the pivotal mechanism can operate without a budget deficit .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ t : vpbb_adiag ] as well .",

[ dominant_a ] . as the exit equilibria for the non - dominant users remains unchanged",
    ", so does their participation incentives .",
    "furthermore , we see that no equilibrium can lead to budget surplus in the pivotal mechanism . that is , although the pivotal mechanism needs to give out a smaller reward to the dominant user in case @xmath115 as compared to case @xmath113 ( hence the jump in the third plot in fig .",
    "[ dominant_a ] ) , it still fails to avoid a deficit in both cases , due to the small willingness of free - riders to pay the taxes required to cover this reward .",
    "first , note that we have identified families of _ positive instances _ ; i.e , problem parameters under which one or both mechanisms can achieve participation and maintain a balanced budget simultaneously .",
    "these include cases @xmath118 and @xmath119 in table [ t : vpbb_adiag ] , which are positive instances for both mechanisms , as well as the region with small @xmath120 and @xmath121 parameters , fig .",
    "[ small_a2_1 ] , which is a positive instance for the pivotal mechanism .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the insight behind the existence of each positive instance :    * in cases @xmath118 and @xmath119 of table [ t : vpbb_adiag ] , incentive mechanisms allow an _ exchange of favors _ among users : as all users are mainly dependent on others investments , they coordinate to each increase their investments in return for improved investments by other users . * in the region with small @xmath120 and @xmath121 parameters in fig .",
    "[ small_a2_1 ] , the pivotal mechanism is successful as it facilitates _ the transfer of funds _ from the reliant users to the self - dependent users in return for their improved investments .",
    "second , we observe that when possible , the selection of exit equilibria that are less beneficial to the outliers helps the performance of both mechanisms .",
    "a less beneficial equilibrium can be one that requires a free - rider to become an investor when leaving the mechanism , or one that requires an investor to continue exerting effort when out ( although possibly at a lower level ) .",
    "one instance of this feature can be seen by comparing cases @xmath118 and @xmath119 with case @xmath122 in table [ t : vpbb_adiag ] . the same can be observed from fig .",
    "[ small_a2_1 ] , when @xmath120 grows , and also by comparing figs .",
    "[ small_a2_1 ] and [ large_a2_1 ] .",
    "based on this observation , we can expect that in a repeated game setup of security games , by punishing outliers with an appropriate selection of less beneficial equilibria , social optimality , voluntary participation , and budget balance conditions can be simultaneously guaranteed .",
    "the problem of incentivizing optimal security investments in an interconnected system is one example of problems concerning the provision of non - excludable public goods in social and economic networks .",
    "other examples include creation of new parks or libraries at neighborhood level in cities @xcite , reducing pollution by neighboring towns @xcite , or spread of innovation and research in industry @xcite .",
    "we summarize some of the work most relevant to the current paper .",
    "@xcite introduces a network model of public goods , and studies different features of its nash equilibria .",
    "this model is equivalent to a total effort game with linear investment costs and a general interdependence graph .",
    "the authors show that these games always have a _ specialized _",
    "nash equilibrium ; i.e. , one in which users are either specialists exerting full effort ( equivalent to main investors in our terminology ) , or free - riders .",
    "they show that such equilibria correspond to maximal independent sets of the graph , and that specialized equilibira may lead to higher welfare compared to other ( distributed ) nash equilibria .",
    "similarly , @xcite studies the nash equilibrium of a linear quadratic interdependence model , and relates the equilibrium effort levels to the nodes bonacich centrality in a suitably defined matrix of local complementarities .",
    "the work in @xcite generalizes these results by studying existence , uniqueness , and closed form of the nash equilibrium in a broader class of games for which best - responses are linear in other players actions .",
    "all the aforementioned work focuses on the nash equilibrium in public good provision environments .",
    "the work of @xcite is the most relevant to our work , as it focuses on implementation of pareto efficient public good outcomes , rather than the nash equilibria on a given network .",
    "the authors define a _ benefits matrix _ for any given network graph ; an entry @xmath123 of the matrix is the marginal rate at which @xmath1 s effort can be substituted by the externality of @xmath60 s action .",
    "the main result of the paper states that efforts at a lindahl outcome constitute an eigenvalue centrality vector of this benefits matrix .",
    "one such pareto efficient outcome , the socially optimal outcome , can be implemented using lindahl taxes determined through the externality mechanism .",
    "the current paper differs from @xcite in both modeling and results .",
    "first , while a user s action in @xcite is strictly costly for the user itself , users in our framework benefit from their own investments as well .",
    "more importantly , the focus of @xcite is on characterizing users effort levels in terms of network structure for lindahl outcomes , the individual rationality of which is established by comparing the pareto efficient outcome with the state of anarchy , rather than considering unilateral deviations from the mechanism .",
    "our work on the other hand considers both lindahl and pivotal taxes , and focuses on users voluntary participation incentives when unilaterally opting out , as well as tax balance issues .",
    "finally , in the context of security games , our work in section [ sec : sim ] is most related to @xcite .",
    "the weighted total effort risk model is a generalization of the total effort model in @xcite , and is similar to the effective investment model in @xcite and the linear influence network game in @xcite .",
    "the linear influence models in @xcite have been proposed to study properties of the interdependence matrix affecting the existence and uniqueness of the nash equilibrium .",
    "the effective investment model in @xcite has been considered to determine a bound on the price of anarchy gap , i.e. the gap between the socially optimal and nash equilibrium investments , in security games .",
    "our work on the above model complements this literature , by considering the effect of users interdependence on the performance of incentive mechanisms .",
    "we have shown that in the problem of provision of non - excludable public goods on networks , under general assumptions on the graph structure and users preferences , it is not possible to design a tax - based incentive mechanism to implement the socially optimal solution while guaranteeing voluntary participation and maintaining a ( weakly ) balanced budget . even under a fully connected graph and users with weighted total effort risk functions , we need further conditions on problem parameters ( e.g. number of users , the level of interdependence , and cost of investment ) to ensure that the well - known pivotal and externality mechanisms can achieve social optimality , budget balance , and voluntary participation , simultaneously .",
    "these positive instances occur when users can exchange favors by agreeing on increasing their investments , or when they can transfer funds to the more influential users in return for their increased efforts .",
    "a comprehensive characterization of problem instances in which all requirements can be simultaneously satisfied remains a main direction of future work .",
