    "<S> we consider models for the quasiparticle - ion ( qp - ion ) interaction , including the hard - sphere potential , constrained random - phase - shifts , and interactions with short - range repulsion and intermediate range attraction . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the transverse force responsible for the anomalous hall effect is particularly sensitive to the structure of the qp - ion potential , and that strong short - range repulsion , captured by the hard - sphere potential , provides an accurate model for computing the forces acting on the moving electron bubble in superfluid . </S>"
