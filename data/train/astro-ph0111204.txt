    "the red giant branch ( rgb ) bump in globular clusters was theoretically predicted by thomas ( 1967 ) and iben ( 1968 ) as a region where evolution through the rgb is stalled for a time when the h burning shell passes the h abundance inhomogeneity envelope .",
    "this is produced by the stellar outer convection zone at the h shell burning rgb stage after the first dredge - up of a star in a globular cluster .",
    "the first convincing identification of the bump was that of the metal - rich cluster 47 tuc ( king , da costa , & demarque 1985 ) .",
    "the position in luminosity of the rgb bump is a function of metal abundance , helium abundance , and stellar mass ( and hence cluster age ) as well as any additional parameters that determine the maximum inward extent of the convection envelope or the position of the h burning shell .",
    "thus the position of this peak on the giant branch of ggcs should provide observational constraints on these parameters .",
    "rgb bumps in galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) were first observationally identified in a systematic way by fusi pecci et al .",
    "they found rgb bumps in 11 ggcs from the peaks in the differential luminosity function and a change in the slope of the integrated luminosity function using @xmath8 vs. ( @xmath9 ) color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "they discovered a correlation between the positions of rgb bumps in the ggcs and their metallicities .",
    "subsequent to this work , many studies on this subject have been carried out ( sarajedini & norris 1994 ; brocato et al .",
    "1996 ; saviane et al .",
    "recently , ferraro et al . ( 1999 ) systematically identified the positions of rgb bumps in 47 ggcs in @xmath8 vs. ( @xmath9 ) cmds and confirmed the strong correlation between the absolute @xmath8 magnitudes of rgb bumps and metallicities of ggcs .    in the near - infrared band",
    ", the the locations of rgb bumps were identified for 8 ggcs in @xmath12 vs. ( @xmath13 ) cmds and a similar correlation between absolute @xmath12 magnitudes of rgb bumps and metallicities was derived by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the advantage of observing ggcs in the near - ir is an enormous reduction in reddening .",
    "the interstellar reddening in the @xmath12 band ( @xmath14 ) is roughly 10@xmath15 of that in the visual ( @xmath16 ) part of the spectrum .",
    "this imparts a great advantage to near - infrared observations especially toward the disk and severely obscured bulge directions .",
    "therefore , near - infrared observations are much preferred for disk and severely obscured bulge ggcs and for as yet unknown ggcs severely reddened by the galactic bulge in the visual bands . near - infrared observations",
    "are also useful for normal disk and halo ggcs because the @xmath17 color index is a good temperature indicator .    in the near - infrared band ,",
    "rgb bumps of ggcs can be a very useful distance indicator because they are relatively bright , and their position in cmds is close to the hb ( horizontal branch ) .",
    "moreover , the hb , which is a good distance indicator in the @xmath8 band is not useful in the near - infrared cmds . in the near - ir cmds",
    ", the hb is diagonally slanted from the upper right to the lower left position and is not horizontal at all .",
    "so it is difficult to measure the hb levels of ggcs in the near - ir cmds .",
    "it is expected that the rgb bump is a distance indicator which would have the same amount of observational error as the hb used in the optical region since it has a similar hb metallicity dependency .",
    "the goal of this work is to obtain the absolute magnitudes of rgb bumps in as many ggcs as possible in the near - ir band and to derive a robust relation between the luminosities of the bumps and metallicities of ggcs for use as distance indicators in the ir bands . using the photometric data from the 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) second incremental release point source catalog we have investigated the existence of rgb bumps in ggcs and have found a correlation between the absolute magnitudes of rgb bumps and metallicities of ggcs , comparing our findings with the results of ferraro et al .",
    "combining with their data we provide a more robust correlation for the use of rgb bumps as standard candles for deriving distances to other ggcs .    in @xmath18 2 we discuss some characteristics of ggcs near - infrared cmds and in @xmath18 3",
    "investigate the location in luminosity of the rgb bumps and the relation between the luminosity of the bump and metallicity of ggcs , and in @xmath18 4 we briefly summarize our results .",
    "we used photometric data from the 2mass second incremental release point source catalog which were obtained at two 1.3-m telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres in the near - infrared bands at @xmath19 ( 1.25@xmath20 m ) , @xmath21 ( 1.65@xmath20 m ) , and @xmath0 ( 2.17@xmath20 m ; @xmath12 short = medium modified @xmath12 ) . limiting magnitudes of the 2mass second incremental release point source catalog photometric data are about 15 mag and the released data from 2mass now covers @xmath2247@xmath15 of the sky .",
    "the @xmath2 photometric data for ggcs in harris ( 1996 ) catalog which are relatively close to the sun are obtained from the ipac ( infrared processing and analysis center ) and @xmath0 vs. ( @xmath1 ) cmds are constructed .",
    "we rejected data whose errors are larger than 0.15 mag .",
    "we can construct cmds of about 46.8@xmath15 of ggcs in harris ( 1996 ) catalog from the 2mass second incremental release point source catalog .",
    "however , the quality of many cmds is not good enough to find the bumps because the limiting magnitudes are too bright .    in figure 1",
    "we present cmds of 11 ggcs for which the rgb bump positions are accurately measured by the systematic analytical method described in @xmath18 3.1 . according to figure 1",
    "the major characteristics of the cmds of ggcs in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 plane are as follows .",
    "first , the bhb ( blue horizontal branch ) and rhb ( red horizontal branch ) are diagonally tilted from the upper right to the lower left position and such features are obvious in the cmds of m4 ( ngc 6121 ) and m107 ( ngc 6171 ) which have both bhb and rhb .",
    "even the rhb of 47 tuc ( ngc 104 ) , which has only rhb , is clearly tilted .",
    "so in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds it is difficult to determine the hb level of any ggc and to correlate rgb bump positions and hb levels in the near - infrared cmds , in contrast to the case for optical cmds .",
    "second , the brightness interval between the msto ( main sequence turnoff ) and rgb tip is larger ( @xmath229 mag ) than in optical cmds ( @xmath226.5 mag ) , as can be easily seen in m4 .",
    "so the magnitude resolution in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds is larger than in optical cmds .",
    "however , color resolution in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds is smaller than in optical cmds because in the latter the rgb and agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) are separated from one another at least in the lower part of the agb . in contrast , in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds the rgb and agb overlap , as clearly shown in the cmd of 47 tuc whose agb is relatively rich . in the optical cmds of ngc 362 , 47 tuc , and m71 ( ngc 6838 ) ,",
    "the separation of their rgbs and rhbs is clearly seen but they partially overlap in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds .",
    "this also results from the fact that the color resolution in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds is lower than that in optical cmds .",
    "third , in the case of m22 ( ngc 6656 ) , its rgb is broader than those of other ggcs as found in the optical cmd ( peterson & cudworth 1994 ) .",
    "moreover , in the lower part of the rgb , contamination from bulge component stars is severe . to the right of the rgb of m22",
    "there exists another rgb component .",
    "this rgb component would be due to bulge rgb stars , which extend prominently redward in the optical cmd ( in our unpublished data ) because of the strong blanketing effects of heavy metals as found in metal - rich ggcs such as ngc 6553 ( ortolani , barbuy , & bica 1990 ) .",
    "last , because ngc 362 and 47 tuc cmds are located in the direction of the smc , a contribution from the smc appears in the lower right region of their cmds .",
    "in order to accurately measure the luminosity of the rgb bump and construct luminosity functions of the ggcs , we applied several standard procedures to delineate only the rgb sequences for all ggcs except for m22 and m71 .",
    "first we rejected visually clear hb stars and agb stars in the process of distinguishing outlying field stars from rgb stars .",
    "second , by binning the rgb sequences in 0.5 mag intervals we measured the average and sigma of each bin and rejected stars 2@xmath24 away from the mean value of each bin .",
    "we then remeasured the average and sigma of each bin and further rejected stars 2@xmath24 away from the remeasured average of each bin , and iterated this process until no stars were rejected and the average and sigma of each bin converged .",
    "third , from each rgb sequence after field star rejection , we constructed a differential luminosity function and an integral luminosity function for each ggc following the classical method of fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "then , we searched for a significant peak in the differential luminosity function and a corresponding large slope change in the integral luminosity function simultaneously for each ggc . where the significant peak position in the differential luminosity function and the position of large slope change in the integral luminosity function coincide , we identified the significant peak as the rgb bump of the given ggc and measured this position ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , in several ggcs the existence of rgb bumps is very clear only when considering the differential luminosity functions .    in the case of m22 , since its cmd is severely contaminated by field and bulge stars , we clipped off the proper region in order to isolate the rgb sequence to @xmath0 @xmath25 13 .",
    "below @xmath0 @xmath25 13 , isolation of the rgb sequence is difficult because of severe contamination by the field and bulge stars .    in the case of m71 ,",
    "the rgb is too poorly populated to be clearly defined .",
    "so in order to isolate the rgb sequence of m71 we used the 2@xmath24 clipped rgb sequence of 47 tuc with a similar metallicity as a template for the rgb sequence of m71 .",
    "the remaining processes were the same as for the other ggcs .",
    "differential luminosity functions and integral luminosity functions for each ggc are shown in figure 2 .    in order to derive absolute magnitudes of ggc rgb bumps ( @xmath5 ) from their apparent magnitudes we need absolute distance moduli and interstellar reddenings .",
    "we take these values from table 2 of ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) except for m22 and m2 ( ngc 7089 ) .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 1999 ) derived absolute distance moduli in a very systematic way using the hb level as a distance indicator , or more strictly speaking the zahb ( zero age horizontal branch ) level .",
    "they derived zahb levels for ggcs by comparing the cmds of ggcs with synthetic h - r diagrams .",
    "then they derived absolute distance moduli using absolute magnitude levels of the zahb ( @xmath26 ) and interstellar reddening .",
    "for interstellar reddening they adopted values from the compilation of harris ( 1996 ) .    in the cases of m22 and m2 , which are not in the list of ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we calculated their absolute distance moduli based on the same method described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , referring to other sources for the physical values .",
    "for derivation of the absolute distance moduli of m22 and m2 we used the magnitude difference between the apparent visual magnitude of the zahb ( @xmath27 ) and the absolute visual magnitude of the zahb ( @xmath26 ) of each cluster .",
    "that is as follows :    @xmath28    for @xmath27 we used equation ( 2 ) in @xmath18 5 of ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) :    @xmath29}^{2 } + 0.236{\\rm [ m / h ] } + 0.193 .\\ ] ]    by the way , @xmath30-element enhanced global metallicity [ m / h ] values for m22 and m2 were computed by equation ( 1 ) in @xmath18 3.4 of ferraro et al .",

    "according to ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , for the 19 ggcs with [ @xmath30/fe ] listed by salaris & cassisi ( 1996 ) or carney ( 1996 ) , they adopted @xmath32 = @xmath33}$ ] .",
    "for all the others they assumed @xmath32 = @xmath34 if [ fe / h ] @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath32 = @xmath37}$ ] if [ fe / h ] @xmath38 @xmath36 .",
    "so , for m22 we adopted [ @xmath30/fe ] = 0.32 from carney ( 1996 ) , averaged over 9 stars which include all 3 stars of m22 in salaris & cassisi ( 1996 ) . for m2 [ @xmath30/fe ]",
    "is not listed in salaris & cassisi ( 1996 ) or carney ( 1996 ) .",
    "so , we adopted @xmath32 = @xmath34 because [ fe / h ] of m2 is @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath26 we used equation ( 4 ) for [ fe / h ] in @xmath18 6.4 of ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) :    @xmath40 } + 0.0458{\\rm [ fe / h]}^{2 } .\\ ] ]    for @xmath16 we adopted @xmath16 = 3.08@xmath41 from he et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and for @xmath42 , which is used in the calculation of apparent @xmath0 magnitude distance moduli for program ggcs , we adopted @xmath42 = 0.32@xmath41 from he et al .",
    "all parameters of m22 and m2 are listed in table 1 .",
    "all these final values for absolute distance moduli and interstellar reddening of program ggcs are listed in table 2 . according to ferraro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the global uncertainty of the absolute distance moduli is of the order of about 0.2 mag considering that the derived absolute distance moduli are affected by many uncertainties ( namely , the evaluation of the zahb level , the zero point and dependence on metallicity of the zahb level , reddening , etc . ) .",
    "finally , using absolute distance moduli and interstellar reddenings we derived absolute magnitudes of the rgb bumps of ggcs ( @xmath43 ) listing them in table 2 together with @xmath3 . in table 2 , errors in column ( 6 ) are measurement errors and errors in column ( 7 ) are a combination of measurement errors in column ( 6 ) and the global uncertainty of the absolute distance moduli , which is equal to 0.2 mag .    in the case of m2 , the rgb bump appears in the expected position according to equations ( 5a ) , ( 5b ) and ( 6a ) , ( 6b ) in the next section , but the bump is relatively broader compared to those of other ggcs , and the quality of its ir cmd is poor compared to the optical cmd of lee & carney ( 1999 ) .",
    "cudworth ( 1985 ) claimed that in the optical cmd of m71 there is a strong clump just below the hb whose position in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath44 plane is @xmath8 @xmath45 15 and @xmath44 @xmath45 1.2 . transforming these values into the @xmath19 vs. @xmath23 plane by the color transformation table of bessell , castelli , & plez ( 1998 )",
    ", @xmath8 @xmath45 15 transforms into @xmath0 @xmath45 11.92 and @xmath44 @xmath45 1.2 transforms into @xmath23 @xmath45 0.77 . also , according to girardi et al.s ( 2000 ) evolutionary tracks the former values correspond to @xmath0 @xmath45 11.94 and @xmath23 @xmath45 0.72 . these transformed @xmath0 and @xmath23 values of the strong clump of m71 in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath44 cmd",
    "nearly match the rgb bump position @xmath0 @xmath25 11.95 and @xmath23 @xmath25 0.72 derived in this work .",
    "so the strong clump reported by cudworth ( 1985 ) in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath44 cmd of m71 must be the rgb bump derived in this work in the @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmd .    in the cases of m69 ( ngc 6637 ) and @xmath46 cen ( ngc 5139 )",
    "we can see the rgb bump features in their cmds .",
    "however , for m69 it is difficult to measure the rgb bump position by systematic analysis because it exhibits a cmd which is too scatted to analyze . also for @xmath46 cen we abandoned the analysis because @xmath46 cen has a wide rgb suggesting a metallicity spread ( lee et al .",
    "1999 ; pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) , which renders measurement of rgb bump position meaningless in this work .",
    "however , in the cases of m30 ( ngc 7099 ) and m55 ( ngc 6809 ) , we can not detect rgb bumps at the expected positions taking into account their metallicity after careful analysis of their differential and integral luminosity functions .",
    "figure 3 shows their @xmath0 vs. @xmath23 cmds , differential luminosity functions , and integral luminosity functions . for m30",
    "there are hints of bumps at @xmath0 @xmath22 12.5 and @xmath22 13.5 .",
    "however , no slope changes around those magnitudes are found in the integral luminosity function . for m55 neither a bump nor a significant slope change are found .",
    "there are two widely used metallicity scales , the zinn & west scale ( zinn & west 1984 ; zinn 1980 , 1985 ; armandroff & zinn 1988 ) and the carretta & gratton scale ( carretta & gratton 1997 ) .",
    "the zinn & west scale ( hereafter zw scale ) employs the most complete data set but is not based on high resolution spectra . however , the carretta & gratton scale ( hereafter cg97 scale ) is based on systematic high resolution spectra obtained by their own team , and there is a transformation relation between the zw scale and the cg97 scale in equation ( 7 ) of carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the cg97 scale is more robust since it relies on recent high resolution spectroscopic measurements and up - to - date atmospheric models .",
    "moreover , in order to compare our results directly with those of ferraro et al .",
