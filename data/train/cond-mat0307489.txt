    "nonequilibrium growth models leading naturally to self - organized fractal structures , such as diffusion limited aggregation ( dla )  @xcite , have received great interest in the recent years not only due to their relevance for various physical processes , for example dielectric breakdown  @xcite , electrochemical deposition  @xcite , and two - fluid laplacian flow  @xcite , but also because such harmonic growth leads naturally to one of the most interesting multifractal distributions found in nature  @xcite .",
    "a powerful method for studying such two dimensional growth processes is the iterated stochastic conformal mapping  @xcite , which has already been successfully applied to generate and analyze dla  @xcite and laplacian  @xcite growth patterns in two dimensions .",
    "this has opened the road to address many important questions related to pattern formation in dla , such as the structure of the multifractal spectrum of dla  @xcite , and provided the first definite answers for how the hottest tips and the coldest fjords grow .",
    "other topics that can be investigated using iterated conformal maps include the pinning transition in laplacian growth  @xcite , the difference between hele - shaw flows and dla  @xcite , as well as new topics such as the scaling of fracture surfaces formed during quasistatic cracking  @xcite .",
    "one of the important questions addressed soon after the original discovery of dla by witten and sander  @xcite was that of the effect of the intrinsic anisotropy in lattice models on the shape and fractal dimension of the asymptotic aggregates  @xcite . for two dimensional growth ,",
    "it was shown that the result of such anisotropy in the microscopic attachment probability leads to clusters which asymptotically have the symmetry of the underlying lattice ( following the argument in ref  @xcite , this actually holds for @xmath12 , where @xmath0 represents the coordination number of the lattice ) , and the fractal dimension of the resulting aggregate asymptotically approaches @xmath13 .",
    "these results have also been confirmed in recent work which used iterated stochastic conformal mapping techniques to grow the clusters  @xcite .    in the present work we use iterated stochastic conformal mapping techniques to study dla with",
    "@xmath0 preferred directions for growth .",
    "although this naturally leads to anisotropic clusters , the present model is fundamentally different from the previous studies on lattice anisotropy .",
    "our model is rather related to the existence of a large scale imposed @xmath0-fold symmetry whose strength can be tuned .",
    "specifically let us consider the case when the harmonic measure for dla is weighted at angle @xmath14 between the seed and the location for growth by a term @xmath15 , where @xmath1 specifies the angular width of the preferred direction .",
    "such a weighting @xmath16 $ ] could be due to an imposed external field or to growth on a surface which has an @xmath0 fold symmetry .",
    "an example would be dendritic growth in a strip  @xcite which can be argued to lie in the @xmath17 or @xmath18 universality class , the anisotropy increasing as the strip is narrowed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe how we use conformal mapping methods together with an angle dependent probability for growth @xmath19 to study a model corresponding to a real space weighting @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the angle parametrising the unit circle to which the boundary of the growing cluster is conformally mapped , @xmath0 is the number of the privileged directions , and @xmath4 is an appropriate measure for the `` strength '' of the anisotropy . in section",
    "iii we present results for the morphology of the resulting patterns as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and we derive using scaling arguments the effective fractal dimension @xmath9 of the emerging clusters .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in section iv .",
    "in the dla model proposed by witten and sander  @xcite the growth of a cluster from a seed placed at the origin proceeds by irreversible attachment of random walkers released from infinity ( in practice , from far away from the cluster s boundary ) .",
    "thus the probability @xmath21 for growth at any point @xmath22 along the cluster boundary of total length @xmath23 is a harmonic measure and can be written @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a potential which outside the cluster obeys laplace s equation @xmath26 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath27 on the ( evolving ) boundary of the cluster and @xmath28 as @xmath29 ( corresponding to a uniform source of particles far away from the cluster ) . in two dimensions , this formulation as a potential problem has been recently exploited for studying the time development of dla based on conformal mapping techniques  @xcite .    as discussed in detail in  @xcite ,",
    "the basic idea is to follow the evolution of the conformal mapping @xmath30 of the exterior of the unit circle in a mathematical @xmath31plane onto the complement of the cluster of @xmath32 particles in the physical @xmath33plane rather than directly the evolution of the cluster s boundary .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath34 is determined recursively ( see fig .  [ fig1](a ) ) . with an initial condition corresponding to the unit circle in the physical plane @xmath35 ,",
    "the process of adding a new `` particle '' of constant shape and linear scale @xmath36 to the cluster of @xmath37 `` particles '' at a position @xmath22 chosen according to the harmonic measure is performed using an elementary mapping @xmath38 @xmath39 -1 \\right \\ } ^a \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\phi_{\\lambda,\\theta } ( \\omega ) = e^{i \\theta } \\phi_{\\lambda,0}(e^{-i \\theta } \\omega ) \\",
    ", , \\label{eq - f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which conformally maps the unit circle to the unit circle with a bump of size @xmath40 localized at the angular position @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 describes the shape of the elementary mapping ; following the analysis in  @xcite , we have used @xmath42 throughout this paper as we believe the large scale asymptotic properties will not be affected by the microscopic shape of the added bump . as shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the recursive dynamics can than be represented as iterations of the elementary bump map @xmath43 , resulting in the convolution representation of the conformal map @xmath44 at the @xmath32th stage of growth as @xmath45 where the angle @xmath46 at step @xmath32 is randomly chosen because the harmonic measure on the real cluster translates to a uniform measure on the unit circle in the mathematical plane , i.e , @xmath47 eq .  [ prob ] is crucial to the successful implementation of the iterated conformal method as the highly nontrivial harmonic measure in the physical plane becomes uniform in the mathematical plane .",
    "finally , @xmath48 is required in order to ensure that the size of the bump in the physical @xmath33 plane is @xmath36 .",
    "we note that in the composition eq .  [ comp ]",
    "the order of iterations is inverted  the last point of the trajectory is the inner argument , therefore the transition from @xmath30 to @xmath49 is achieved by composing the @xmath32 former maps eq .",
    "[ comp ] starting from a different point .",

    "change in shape of the probability distribution @xmath52 with increasing @xmath4 for @xmath53 . ]",
    "consider the case where the existence of @xmath0 preferred directions in physical space modulates the harmonic measure at any point @xmath22 on the boundary by a probability @xmath54 .",
    "here , @xmath55 is the angle parameterisation of the cluster boundary in the physical space , @xmath15 is the modulating weight , and the @xmath0-fold periodicity implies  @xmath56 .",
    "the important question is _ if _ the weighting @xmath15 in the real space may be represented in the form of a modulation of the constant measure in the mathematical plane @xmath57 . because the angle @xmath14 is not invariant under the conformal map @xmath44 , an answer to the question above is not straightforward .",
    "considering an ensemble of clusters generated under the influence of the same modulation @xmath58 , for each cluster of @xmath32 particles @xmath14 maps onto a different @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that averaging over the many patterns above an asymptotically ( @xmath61 ) average scale invariant pattern will appear . for dla , i.e. , in the absence of modulation",
    ", this pattern is a circle ; in the general case , an @xmath0 fold periodic pattern with the same symmetry as the modulation is expected to appear .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes an average over clusters , with @xmath64 independent of @xmath32 and satisfying @xmath65 due to the symmetry of the resulting averaged pattern and to the fact that @xmath66 is an angle . in principle , @xmath66 is defined up to an additive constant ; this can be fixed by specifically requiring that at the pattern fingertips @xmath67 one has @xmath68 .",
    "it then follows that the modulated probability distribution on the unit circle leading to such @xmath69fold symmetry patterns obeys @xmath70 thus , we can see that for this case @xmath71 is itself an @xmath0-fold periodic function on the unit circle with peaks at the preferred directions @xmath72 .    in this paper , rather than attempting to derive a specific @xmath71 using eq .",
    "[ relation ] , we shall directly assume such an @xmath0-fold periodic measure on the unit circle ( which based on the arguments above is expected to lead to an @xmath69fold symmetry weighting function @xmath73 in the physical space ) and study the clusters created using the choice @xmath74 , where the parameter @xmath75 is an appropriate measure of the angular width of the preferred direction in the physical plane .",
    "the angle - dependent probability distribution on the unit circle @xmath76 will be normalized such that @xmath77 .",
    "such a distribution biases the choice of the location @xmath20 , and thus @xmath22 , where growth occurs as follows . at step @xmath32 , the point @xmath22 for the attempt of growth",
    "is chosen , as before , based on the harmonic measure , i.e. , one chooses points @xmath78 on the unit circle with uniform distribution . but growth at @xmath22 is only allowed with a probability @xmath79 .",
    "if the attempt is rejected , then the previous sequence is repeated until a successful trial occurs .",
    "we note that obviously @xmath80 corresponds to usual dla , while an explicit dependence on @xmath20 models the existence of privileged directions .",
    "because at this stage we are interested in the general features of such a model of anisotropic growth , and not in trying to model a specific physical system , we will make the simple choice @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the normalization constant ( note that it does not depend on @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath83 defined above has all the key properties required : for @xmath84 it is a periodic function of @xmath20 of principal period @xmath85 , and thus the number @xmath0 of peaks of @xmath83 in @xmath86 corresponds to the number of privileged directions ; obviously , both @xmath7 independent of @xmath0 and @xmath87 independent of @xmath4 correspond to isotropic dla growth .",
    "the exponent @xmath88 is a measure for the  strength \" of selectivity , i.e. , the larger @xmath4 , the narrower and higher peaks of @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the pair @xmath5 defines a two dimensional parameter space for the analytic study of applied anisotropy to dla . though the choice given by eq .",
    "[ prob_g ] is arbitrary , we believe that because of universality the key features will be independent of the specific form of the function @xmath83 .",
    "the model described in sec .",
    "ii was simulated as follows .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 was fixed because it is just setting the microscopic area of an added `` particle '' . for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath4 the growth step @xmath32 proceeds by selecting at random ( uniform probability ) an angle @xmath90 , then comparing @xmath83 with a random number @xmath91 uniformly distributed in @xmath92 ; if @xmath93 , then @xmath94 , @xmath95 follows from eq .",
    "[ lambda ] , and the new map @xmath96 follows from eq .  [ comp ] ; if not , the previous sequence is repeated until a successful trial occurs .",
    "all the averages mentioned below were done over @xmath97 clusters grown up to size @xmath98 .",
    "an example of clusters with different symmetries ( i.e. , different values @xmath0 ) grown in this manner is shown in fig .",

    "it can be seen that the bias introduced by the distribution @xmath83 is indeed producing clusters with the corresponding @xmath69 fold symmetry and that it is very effective : even for small values @xmath4 , the clusters in fig .",

    "similar results have been obtained for all the values @xmath104 and @xmath105 that have been tested .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] suggest that the resultant patterns have a fractal morphology that depends on @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and in order to characterize these shapes we will focus on the effective fractal dimension @xmath9 obtained from the mass - radius scaling . following the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coefficient @xmath106 in the laurent expansion of @xmath107 , @xmath108 is a typical length - scale of the cluster ; thus , a natural choice for the radius of the @xmath32-particle cluster is @xmath109 . assuming that for @xmath110 a scaling law of the form @xmath111 is found , the effective fractal dimension of the cluster can be extracted from a power law fit to the numerical data .",
