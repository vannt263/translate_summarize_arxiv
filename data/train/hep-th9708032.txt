    "such potentials have the advantage to be simple , local and separable , with the additional advantage that all discussion can be analytical @xcite .    usually , renormalization is carried out by introducing a sufficiently large ( small ) cut - off in momentum ( configuration ) space . with this cut - off the divergences of the original problem",

    "the motivation behind studying this potential is that similar potentials occur in various branches of physics , such as molecular , nuclear and atomic physics @xcite . also , from a mathematical point of view , renormalization in quantum mechanics is an interesting field of interest .",

    "such terms are treated phenomenologically by introducing an arbitrary cut - off at small @xmath1 or large momentum so as to cure the original divergences and to fit some observables .",
    "as the problem is mathematically divergent , the results could be very sensitive to the cut - off and it is not clear that if the momentum cut - off can be taken to infinity in order to produce a meaningful renormalization of the problem . in nucleon - nucleon potentials",
    "the finite size of the hadrons sets a cut - off in both momentum and configuration spaces , and one should work with a finite cut - off .",
    "however , it would be pleasing to see that the results do not get drastically modified as the momentum cut - off is taken to infinity .    in the present work the above problem is renormalized numerically by the introduction of a momentum or configuration space cut - off in different ways .",
    "the cut - off is introduced in the green function or the potential in momentum and configuration spaces , respectively .",
    "the cut - off is finally eliminated in favor of a physical observable / information , which is chosen to be the scattering length and the number of bound states of the system . eventually , we find that by taking the cut - off to infinity , model independent results are obtained .",

    "the regularization of the solution by modifying the green function is standard in particle and intermediate energy physics . in atomic , molecular and nuclear physics",
