    "in this section we introduce several models that we will consider in the remainder of the paper . we define them in terms of microscopic dynamical rules , before outlining the methods by which we represent their master equations and correlation functions .",
    "we begin with the one - spin facilitated frederickson - andersen model  @xcite .",
    "this is referred to simply as ` the ' fa model in what follows ; more general fa models with facilitation by several spins , which exhibit more cooperative behaviour  @xcite , will not be covered here .",
    "we define the model in terms of @xmath2 binary variables , @xmath3 , on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is trivial : @xmath5",
    "we refer to a site with @xmath6 either as an up - spin or as a ` defect ' ; sites with @xmath7 are thought of as down spins or ` empty ' .",
    "the spins can flip with metropolis rates if and only if at least one of their neighbours is in the up state .",
    "that is , for nearest neighbours @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we have @xmath10 since we have detailed balance with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath11 , the ( dimensionless ) rate @xmath12 parametrises the temperature according to @xmath13 , with @xmath14 as usual .",
    "it also sets the equilibrium density @xmath15 we have introduced the notation @xmath16 for an equilibrium dynamical average .    to avoid confusion",
    ", we note that there are other versions of the fa model in the literature . in the original model  @xcite",
    "as described here the rate for flipping a spin @xmath8 is proportional to the number of its up - spin neighbours .",
    "an alternative definition chooses the rate for flipping spin @xmath8 to be independent of the number of neighbours in the up state , as long as there is at least one such neighbour  @xcite .",
    "we do not believe that this choice makes any difference to the critical behaviour of the system , but our exact mappings apply only to the original model as defined above .",
    "we can also define a variant of the fa model in which the occupations @xmath17 are not restricted to binary values , but may be any non - negative integers .",
    "we refer to this as the bosonic fa model , since the natural field theory for describing it has bosonic fields .",
    "this model has transition rates @xmath18 here and throughout , parameters for the bosonic models are distinguished by tildes from those for the hard core ones . the bosonic model ( [ bosonic_fa ] ) obeys detailed balance with respect to the stationary state @xmath19 , so the stationary state density is @xmath20 the bosonic stationary state is again a gibbs distribution with hamiltonian @xmath11 and temperature defined by @xmath21 .",
    "however , in contrast to the hard core case it includes an a priori phase space weight factor @xmath22 , as appropriate for boson statistics .    we will establish a mapping between the fa model and another model of diffusing defects . in this model",
    ", defects appear in pairs out of the empty state , and annihilate in pairs into it ; they also diffuse freely across the lattice .",
    "we refer to this model as the aa model , since the defects appear and annihilate .",
    "both the aa and fa models can be interpreted as reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "the aa model has explicit diffusion , combined with reversible annihilation @xmath0 .",
    "( we follow the standard nomenclature of reaction - diffusion models here , with @xmath23 referring to our single species of particles , i.e.  defects . )",
    "the model is defined for binary variables : for nearest neighbours @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath24 where we choose @xmath25 this model also obeys detailed balance with respect to the trivial hamiltonian , @xmath11 , at a temperature parametrised by @xmath26 .",
    "note that , once a trivial overall scale for the rates has been removed , there are in principle two dimensionless rates , and the requirement of detailed balance with respect to @xmath11 only fixes one of these , namely the ratio of the rates for appearance and annihilation .",
    "for now , we do not let the diffusion rate vary independently and instead tie @xmath27 to @xmath26 .",
    "the mapping between the fa and aa models will then connect models with the same value of the single parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the two - parameter generalisation of the aa model with an arbitrary diffusion constant also has a mapping to a generalised fa model , as we discuss in section  [ sec : fa_diff ] . for notational convenience we study the above ` standard ' aa and fa models first in what follows .",
    "finally , there is also a bosonic variant of the aa model with rates @xmath28 where we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the stationary state densities in the aa models are @xmath31 note that in the limit of small @xmath12 , the relation ( [ equ : def_gamma ] ) between @xmath26 and @xmath12 becomes @xmath32 , and thus identical to the one for the bosonic models .",
    "more generally , the hard core and bosonic models should become effectively equivalent at low densities where multiple occupany of sites is very unlikely .",
    "we will exploit this correspondence frequently .",
    "it is convenient to write stochastic averages for systems such as those defined above in an operator formalism  @xcite .",
    "this is a standard technique , so we largely restrict this section to definitions of the quantities that we will use later .    when considering the bosonic versions of the fa and aa models we use a bosonic algebra with creation and annihilation operators on each site : @xmath33=[a_i^\\dag , a_j^\\dag]=0 $ ] ; @xmath34=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "the state @xmath35 is then associated with the vector @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the vacuum state which has all sites empty ; the set of all @xmath38 state probabilities @xmath39 is mapped to the vector @xmath40 .",
    "the individual probabilities can be retrieved via @xmath41 , and since they must sum to unity one has @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a ` projection state ' that implements the sum over all possible system configurations .",
    "the master equation can then be written in operator form as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is known as the liouvillian or simply the master operator .",
    "the off - diagonal elements @xmath46 of @xmath47 give the rates for transitions from state @xmath35 to @xmath48 , while the diagonal elements follow from the requirement @xmath49 .",
    "since the master equation is linear , it can be solved formally as @xmath50 . if we specify the initial state as @xmath35 we can read off from this the probability of making a transition to state @xmath51 in some time interval @xmath52 : @xmath53   \\rme^{-\\mathcal{l}t } \\left [ \\prod_i ( a_i^\\dag)^{n_i } \\right ] |0\\rangle .",
    "\\label{equ : paa_bos}\\ ] ] expectation values over the stochastic dynamics can also be expressed in a simple form ; for example , the average of some function @xmath54 at time @xmath52 becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 is particle number operator for site @xmath8 .",
    "similar expressions can be written for correlations functions involving two or more times , as illustated below .",
    "the hard core models with their binary occupation variables @xmath17 have similar relations but here the states are generated by operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 in a spin-@xmath59 algebra , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the state vector is now @xmath62 , and conversely @xmath63 .",
    "conservation of probability requires @xmath64 with the appropriate projection state now being @xmath65 transition probabilities and single - time averages take the forms @xmath66 \\rme^{-\\mathcal{l}t } \\left [ \\prod_i ( s_i^+)^{n_i } \\right ] | 0 \\rangle , \\label{equ : paa}\\ ] ] and @xmath67 respectively , where now @xmath68",
    ". occasionally it will be useful to write states and operators in notation analogous to pauli matrices and spin vectors . choosing a basis at each site as @xmath69 one has for example @xmath70 in principle one should write in this expression a direct product @xmath71 with identity operators at all other sites , but for ease of presentation we drop this here and below , along with site subscripts @xmath8 where these are clear from the context .",
    "our ordering of the basis states , while the reverse of the usual convention for spins , facilitates comparisons with other work on reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite .",
    "it also emphasises the analogy to the bosonic case , where the only natural ordering of the basis states is in order of increasing occupancy .",
    "it remains to give the forms of the master operator @xmath45 for our models .",
    "their matrix elements are easily derived from the relevant transition rates as explained above .",
    "one finds : @xmath72 ,   \\label{lfa_def } \\\\",
    "\\fl { \\tilde{\\mathcal{l}}_\\mathrm{fa}}&= & \\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle }   \\left [ ( a_i^\\dag-1 ) a_j^\\dag a_j ( a_i-{{\\tilde{c } } } ) + ( i\\leftrightarrow j ) \\right ] , \\label{lbfa_def }",

    "the operators @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the hard core models have been written in a suggestive form that emphasises the connection with their bosonic counterparts @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    before leaving this section , we note that the stationary states of our models have simple closed forms in the quantum formalism , viz . @xmath77 for the hard core and bosonic case , respectively .",
    "the latter is distinguished by a tilde as usual .",
    "correlations in the stationary state then also take a rather simple form . for times",
    "@xmath78 that are in increasing order we have @xmath79 the aa model has an identical relation with @xmath73 replaced by @xmath74 and @xmath12 replaced by @xmath26 , and for the bosonic models one merely has to substitute for the master operator , projection and stationary state vectors their bosonic equivalents .",
    "having set up the operator formalism for dynamics , we now investigate some properties of the master operators for these models . we first consider the effects of detailed balance , which tells us that the operator @xmath80 is hermitian ( or more specifically symmetric , since all matrix elements are real ) . here",
    "@xmath81 is the ( hermitian ) operator for the energy .",
    "multiplying by @xmath82 from the left and right shows that also @xmath83 is hermitian .",
    "this is more useful than @xmath80 since it is related to the liouvillian @xmath45 by a similarity transformation and so has the same eigenvalues . for the fa model we can write explicitly @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the single site operator @xmath86 for the aa model we only need to replace @xmath12 by @xmath26 .",
    "the hermitian forms of the liouvillians are then @xmath87 { \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{fa}}\\left [ \\prod_i h_i(c ) \\right ] , \\qquad h_\\mathrm{aa } = \\left [ \\prod_i h_i^{-1}(c ' ) \\right ] { \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{aa}}\\left [ \\prod_i h_i(c ' ) \\right].\\ ] ] their explicit forms make it evident that they are indeed hermitian : for example @xmath88 , \\label{h_fa}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 is similarly obtained from @xmath74 in ( [ laa_def ] ) by replacing the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 by @xmath92 .    the above similarity transformation to a hermitian form of the liouvillians is convenient since it makes manifest the symmetries and conserved quantites of the systems .",
    "the mapping between fa and aa models relies on the fact that the hermitian operators @xmath93 and @xmath94 are related by the _ exact _",
    "unitary ( or , more specifically , orthogonal ) transformation @xmath95 where @xmath96 =    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+c ' } } { \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1&\\sqrt{c'}\\\\#2&1\\end{array}\\right)}{},\\ ] ] with @xmath97 as usual .",
    "equation ( [ equ : def_u ] ) is the key relation from which most other results for the hard core models are derived ; it is easy to verify by direct calculation .",
    "the operator @xmath98 has a simple geometrical interpretation : it is just a rotation about the @xmath99-axis of the spin sphere , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : map_geom ] below .",
    "from ( [ equ : def_u ] ) we have directly a similarity transform between the corresponding master operators for the fa and aa models : @xmath100 with @xmath101 we have exploited the freedom to introduce an arbitrary prefactor into @xmath102 to ensure that both its columns add up to unity , i.e.@xmath103 for the whole transformation @xmath104 this implies that the projection state ( [ equ : bra1 ] ) is invariant under multiplication by either @xmath104 or @xmath105 from the right , @xmath106 .",
    "so ( [ equ : def_v ] ) automatically maps a probability - preserving liouvillian onto another one .    various relations between correlation functions in the two models",
    "can now be established .",

    "this is because the transformation ( [ n_transf ] ) of the number operator produces a non - diagonal operator which does not directly correspond to a physical observable .",
    "only where the transformed operator is applied either to the projection state on the left , as in ( [ appl_to_left ] ) , or the steady state on the right , as in ( [ appl_to_right ] ) , can such a link be made ; otherwise more complicated relations result  @xcite .",
    "the most useful aspect of the mapping ( [ equ : def_v ] ) is that it will enable us to reveal symmetries of the fa model which are ` inherited ' from symmetries of the aa model .",
    "specifically , it is clear from the dynamical rules of the aa model that the parity of the total number of particles in the system is conserved .",
    "mathematically , we have that @xmath115 { \\mathcal{l}_\\mathrm{aa}}\\left[\\prod_i 2s^z_i \\right ] , \\label{equ : parity}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 .",
    "geometrically , the operator @xmath117 simply produces a rotation of @xmath118 radians about the @xmath119-axis of the spin sphere .",
    "since the fa and aa models are related by a similarity transformation , there must be a symmetry of the fa model that is equivalent to the aa parity symmetry . applying the transformation ( [ equ : def_v ] ) to equation ( [ equ : parity ] )",
    ", we arrive at @xmath120 with @xmath121 v = \\prod_i w_i , \\quad w_i = v_i^{-1}(2s^z_i ) v_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+c } } { \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}-1&-1\\\\#2&1\\end{array}\\right)}{}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath122 , as expected for a symmetry deriving from the parity symmetry in the aa model . to understand more closely the effect of @xmath123 note first that , in the aa case , the rotation @xmath124 maps the steady state vector @xmath125 to the vector @xmath126 where the probabilities of all states @xmath35 containing an odd number of particles acquire a negative sign .",
    "the sum and difference of these two states gives the physical steady states for initial conditions containing an even and odd number of particles , respectively . in the fa case , @xmath123 also maps two steady states onto each other : @xmath127 .",
    "the symmetry thus links the ` conventional ' steady state , which is reached for any nonzero initial number of particles , to the vacuum , i.e.  the empty state ; the latter is trivially a steady state since the kinetic constraints of the fa model forbid any transitions into or out of it .",
    "so while the original symmetry in the aa model connects steady states that are basically equivalent , with associated ` domains of attraction ' of equal size , the inherited symmetry of the fa model relates two very different steady states , with one having a domain of attraction containing _ all _ configurations except for the empty one .",
    "the above relations between the fa and aa models , and their corresponding symmetries , can also be understood in terms of the associated hermitian operators .",
    "they then have simple geometric interpretations , as shown in figure  [ fig : map_geom ] .    in the following",
    "we will continue to refer to ` the ' steady state of the fa model as the one with nonzero particle density .",
    "the symmetry ( [ equ : def_d ] ) then allows us to relate the dynamics in this steady state to that in near empty configurations .",
    "this implies relations between the associated correlation functions . proceeding as in ( [ corr_fn_mapping_calc ] ) ,",

    "the same is easily checked for the operation of @xmath129 on the projection state @xmath130 on the left ; the associated proportionality factors cancel because of overall normalisation .",

    "this relation generalises straightforwardly to correlation functions involving more than two spatial points : we have that @xmath133 \\left [ \\prod_{r=1}^m ( n_{j_r}(0)-n_{\\mathrm{eq } } ) \\right ] \\right\\rangle_\\mathrm{fa , eq } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "while this relation may not be familiar , it is closely related to the duality symmetry of the dp fixed point  @xcite .",
    "the latter is more usually expressed in terms of the dynamical action : see section  [ sec : crit ] .    in summary , we see that the transformation @xmath104 maps the parity symmetry of the aa model onto an ( exact ) duality symmetry of the fa model .",
    "the mapping thus exposes a hidden symmetry which would not easily be recognised by looking at the fa model alone .",
    "the discussion so far has considered the fa and aa models , both defined in terms of a single parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we now generalise our arguments to models with extra diffusive processes .",

    "similar comments apply to the persistence function : we do find gaussian scaling as shown in figure  [ fig : fa_persistence ] , but to see this clearly requires very small @xmath12 . note that in order to obtain data for @xmath424 and @xmath425 we used virtual simulation boxes of size @xmath426 and @xmath427 , respectively   lattice and at @xmath425 there are on average only @xmath428 defects ) keeping track of the persistence status is a problem for large lattices .",
    "we associate single bits with the persistence status of each lattice site so that we can track persistence in lattices up to @xmath429 using a memory block of 125 mb . at @xmath430",

    "although the dp exponents @xmath431 and @xmath432 in @xmath215  @xcite differ only slightly from the gaussian ones , our data clearly allow us to rule them out : the dashed line in figure  [ fig : fa_scalinga ] represents dp scaling of the dynamical correlation length and is inconsistent with our data .",
    "the inset in figure  [ fig : fa_persistence ] demonstrates similarly that the persistence functions @xmath422 do not collapse when plotted against @xmath433 with the dp scaling @xmath434 ; a rather similar picture  thus not shown  is obtained when plotting the two - point susceptibility @xmath292 , figure  [ fig : fa_scalingb ] , against @xmath433 .",
    "we conclude that the dp fixed point is irrelevant for the fa model , for the same reason that it is irrelevant for the aa model and for parity conserving models of branching and annihilating random walks : these models possess extra symmetries that must be preserved in rg calculations and , in the case of the fa model , lead to gaussian scaling .",
    "this conclusion parallels that of cardy and tuber  @xcite , who showed that an early paper  @xcite on the parity conserving reaction - diffusion system ( @xmath435 ) had produced a similar erroneous conclusion that the upper critical dimension was four and the exponents those of dp .",
    "to summarise , we showed in section  [ sec : map ] that the fa and aa models with hard core exclusion share the same correlation functions ( at equilibrium , and considering a single time - difference )",
    ". this was established by means of an exact mapping at the level of the master equation .",
    "an important generalisation which includes additional diffusive processes demonstrated that the same mapping connects more generally the reaction - diffusion models with reversible coagulation @xmath1 and reversible annihilation @xmath436 .",
    "further , we showed in section  [ sec : bos ] that the bosonic versions of the fa and aa models are appropriate effective theories for the low temperature limits of the hard core models and have analogous symmetries and relations between each other .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : crit ] we discussed the critical properties of the bosonic models using renormalisation group arguments . implementing the mapping at the level of the field - theoretic action showed that the fa ( and more generally @xmath1 ) model renormalises like the aa ( or @xmath0 ) model .",
    "we find that the directed percolation fixed point is irrelevant to the fa model , because of the presence of detailed balance and of an additional hidden symmetry inherited from the parity symmetry of the aa model . instead",
    ", the @xmath437 model and its special case , the fa model , have upper critical dimension two ; detailed balance together with the two exactly known scaling exponents is sufficient to find all exponents exactly also in @xmath264 .    from the point of view of reaction - diffusion systems and , more generally , non - equilibrium stochastic models , the most significant outcome of this work is the result that a hidden symmetry suppresses fluctuations in the @xmath1 model and lowers its upper critical dimension to @xmath212 .",
    "the mapping to @xmath0 can , however , also be used to more quantitative purposes .",
    "for example , it enables one to calculate new exact results for two - time non - equilibrium correlation and response functions in @xmath438 ; we will report on these shortly  @xcite .",
    "the results of such an analysis are instructive also more generally with regard to non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations for activated dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in fact the fa model is an almost paradigmatic example of such dynamics , given that any evolution away from a metastable state containing only isolated defects requires the thermal excitation of additional defects .    from a different angle , one may ask what our results have to say about the usefulness of the fa model for capturing the qualitative behaviour of structural glasses  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that in the physically relevant case of three spatial dimensions , fluctuation effects at low defect densities are of a classical ( mean - field , gaussian ) nature .",
    "nevertheless , the models will still exhibit a degree of dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "violations of the stokes - einstein relation  @xcite may also persist , but will be at most by a constant ( rather than diverging ) factor as @xmath334 ; this is consistent with simulation results  @xcite . in summary , ` glassy ' effects will be present , but probably rather weak .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that fa models also have relatively benign , arrhenius - type increases of relaxation time scales at low temperature : @xmath439 in @xmath213 as we saw above .",
    "these models are therefore suitable at best for modelling for what are known as strong glasses . for fragile glasses with their super - arrhenius timescale divergences , models with facilitation by more than one spin  or with directed constraints  will inevitably have to be used . their much more cooperative dynamics  @xcite continues to make them physically attractive models for understanding non - trivial aspects of glassy dynamics .",

    "we therefore expect that the bosonic fa and aa models will be appropriate effective theories for their hard core counterparts at small particle densities .",
    "for the scaling analysis of equilibrium correlation functions given in section  [ sec : scaling ] we required particular random walk survival probabilities ; these are derived in the following .",
    "consider a pair of diffusing defects .",
    "we can think of these as random walkers on a @xmath4-dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath477 ; whenever they occupy nn sites , where their positions have distance @xmath478 , they coagulate instantaneously .",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath383 that the walkers survive to infinite time , i.e.  never coagulate .",
    "this survival probability depends on the spatial dimensionality @xmath4 and on the initial separation @xmath479 of the walkers .",
    "the distance vector @xmath480 also performs a random walk , with twice the effective diffusion constant .",
    "the problem is therefore to calculate the probability @xmath383 that a random walker starting from position @xmath481 will never reach one of the nn sites of the origin . if we picture these sites as absorbing , then @xmath482 is the probability that the walker is absorbed eventually ; for absorption at the origin itself , these quantities are well known .",
    "the key insight is that , in its first step , the walker randomly moves to one of the nn sites of @xmath481 ; we write these as @xmath483 .",
    "the absorption probability starting from @xmath481 is therefore the average of those that would be obtained when starting from any of these nn sites : @xmath484 the only exception to this relation is the case where @xmath481 itself is already an absorption site so that @xmath485 .",
    "we can correct for this by adding a source term at these sites ; the latter then has to be set at the end of the calculation to give the correct values of @xmath486 at the absorption sites .",

    "<S> we define the fa and aa models in section  [ sec : models ] . </S>",
    "<S> both are models of hard core particles , but have generalisations in which particles can share the same lattice site ; we also define these models ( which we refer to as ` bosonic ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mapping between the fa and aa models is determined by their symmetries : it has quite a rich geometrical stucture , which we discuss in section  [ sec : map ] . in section  [ sec : fa_diff ] </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the same mapping also connects the more general reaction - diffusion processes @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an analagous mapping also exists between the corresponding bosonic models ( section  [ sec : bos ] ) . in section  [ sec : crit ] we study the critical properties of the various models . </S>",
