    "the main objective of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion physics , both experimentally and theoretically , is to create and study hot and dense matter of strongly interacting constituents . at sufficiently large temperatures and densities ,",
    "the theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) predicts a phase transition from the hadronic world into a chirally symmetric state of free quarks and gluons , the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "however , the transient nature of this new state of matter renders its identification very complex . after more than a decade of experiments ,",
    "a wealth of exciting results has emerged from the sps program as well as from recent data taken at the the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven . however , as of now , no conclusive evidence of qgp formation has been discerned .",
    "it has rather become clear that the discovery of the qgp would not emerge from a single signature but from a combination of several in a comprehensive scenario .    among the probes of qgp formation , the @xmath0  meson plays a central role . due to its large binding energy and rather small size",
    ", it is expected to be only mildly affected by interactions in a hadronic environment . on the contrary , as suggested first by matsui and satz  @xcite in 1986 , if a qgp is formed , @xmath0   formation should be inhibited due to color charge screening by free - moving quarks and gluons . from a slightly different perspective",
    ", a similar effect can be attributed to parton - induced destruction  @xcite . in either picture ,",
    "the @xmath0  abundance observed in heavy - ion collisions is linked to properties of the initial hot and/or dense phases of the produced matter .",
    "however , the identification of the plasma effect requires a careful assessment of other mechanisms for @xmath0   destruction in the course of a heavy - ion reaction .",
    "most notably , absorption on high - energetic nucleons at early times induces a substantial suppression of typically 60% in central collisions .",
    "although its dependence has been thoroughly investigated experimentally in both proton and light - ion induced reactions with various targets  @xcite theoretical uncertainties in the application to the heavy - projectile case persist  @xcite . furthermore , despite the naive expectation given above , the current status in the description of inelastic charmonium scattering on `` comoving '' ( secondary ) hadrons in the late stages of the collision is not satisfactorily under control .",
    "this renders the identification of the effect of the quark - gluon plasma formation on @xmath0  abundances more difficult to establish .",
    "recently , an additional source of @xmath0  _ production _ in heavy - ion collisions has been suggested",
    ". within thermal model frameworks  @xcite , which successfully describe light - hadron ratios , statistical production of charmonium at the qcd hadronization transition has been evaluated  @xcite .",
    "gazdzicki and gorenstein found  @xcite that statistical production alone can account for the observed centrality dependence of @xmath0  yields at full sps energy , thereby deducing a hadronization temperature consistent with standard chemical freezeout .",
    "however , no reference was made to a dynamical origin for @xmath9 creation , nor to open - charm states .",
    "braun - munzinger and stachel  @xcite started from the dynamically well justified  @xcite hypothesis that at sps energies all @xmath10 pairs are exclusively created in primordial ( hard ) parton - parton collisions .",
    "open- and hidden - charm hadrons are then populated at the hadronization transition according to their thermal weight including a charm - quark fugacity to match the primordial @xmath9 abundance . with the latter taken from extrapolations of @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions , a substantial fraction of @xmath0  mesons",
    "is found . in particular , the @xmath7 over @xmath12 ratio , which in @xmath3-@xmath3 reactions has been observed to rapidly approach its thermal value for @xmath13 , is well described .",
    "along similar lines , gorenstein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite aim at explaining the @xmath0  yields at sps solely in terms of statistical production .",
    "they conclude that an open - charm enhancement factor of up to @xmath14  6 in central @xmath3-@xmath3 collisions ( w.r.t . the standard value inferred from @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions ) is required to optimally reproduce the na50 data  @xcite .",

    "@xcite assessed @xmath9 coalescence in an expanding qgp fireball by solving rate equations for @xmath15 reactions ( gluon - induced `` photo''-dissociation and its reverse reaction ) , with the @xmath0  binding energy assumed to be at its vacuum value at all times in the evolution .",
    "all thermal approaches share the common feature that , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , at rhic energies a copious production of charm - quark pairs ( @xmath16  10 - 20 in central @xmath17-@xmath17 collisions ) implies a much enhanced charmomium yield as compared to early ( hard ) production coupled with nuclear and qgp suppression mechanisms .",
    "however , at sps energies , expected plasma lifetimes of @xmath14  1 - 2 fm / c , together with initial temperatures below @xmath14  250  mev , may not suffice for a ( close to ) complete destruction of primordially produced of @xmath0  mesons . at the same time , a significant increase in open - charm production is not easily justified .",
    "this led us to propose a two - component model  @xcite for charmonium production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it incorporates both a primordial yield ( subject to subsequent dissociation ) as well as a thermal contribution from statistical recombination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks at the hadronization transition .",
    "both components are evaluated within a common thermal fireball framework which is consistent with measured hadro - chemistry , expansion dynamics , and has also been successfully employed to describe electromagnetic observables at sps energies  @xcite .",
    "another important feature is that we refrain from invoking any `` anomalous '' open - charm enhancement .    in the present article",

    "a suppressed abundance of @xmath0  mesons relative to expectations from @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions was first observed in proton - nucleus ( @xmath18-@xmath19 ) and light - ion induced collisions . in these reactions",
    ", one does not expect noticeable effects from secondary particles . indeed , rather extensive experimental studies @xcite have established that the suppression can be understood as the absorption of a `` pre - resonance '' @xmath20 state in the ( normal ) nuclear medium of target and projectile nuclei .",
    "this in particular accounts for the observation that different charmonium states such as @xmath0  and @xmath7 follow very similar absorption patterns , despite their different bound state properties ( _ e.g. _ , binding energy or size ) .",
    "let us briefly summarize the main elements of this `` nuclear absorption '' . in the glauber model of @xmath19-@xmath21 collisions , the probability for the pre - resonance state to be absorbed on its way through the nucleus is given by  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 describes nuclear density profiles ( taken from ref .",

    "together with an absorption cross section of @xmath41  mb and normalization factors of 52.8 for @xmath3-@xmath3 and 48.2 for @xmath4-@xmath5 , our results coincide with nuclear absorption studies of na38 and na50 , cf .",

    "whereas the @xmath4-@xmath5 data are well accounted for , the @xmath3-@xmath3 system departs from nuclear absorption starting at @xmath42  gev , constituting `` anomalous '' @xmath0  suppression  @xcite .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath0  yield from nuclear absorption systematics in @xmath3(158 agev)-@xmath3 has triggered extensive theoretical analyses .",
    "the responsible underlying mechanisms are still a matter of debate , ranging from destruction in a qgp and/or hadron gas to thermal production at @xmath43 .",
    "as stressed above , this work attempts a comprehensive treatment of all three of these aspects within a minimal set of assumptions , which , in particular , is based on a thermal description of the collision dynamics including quark - gluon plasma formation if the initial conditions are energetic enough . in this section , we compute @xmath0  survival probabilities for both the plasma and hadronic phases of heavy - ion reactions .",
    "@xmath0  dissociation in a thermalized qgp has been studied in both static and dynamical frameworks . within the former ,",
    "one typically evaluates the screening of the heavy quark potential by color charges , whereas the latter involves inelastic parton collisions using , _",
    "e.g. _ , the qcd analogue of photo - dissociation , @xmath44  @xcite .    here",
    "we adopt a dynamical approach , accounting however for reduced charmonium binding energies as extracted from a schrdinger equation for @xmath10 bound states in a screened heavy - quark potential  @xcite . under conditions relevant to the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions , the binding energy of the @xmath0",
    "is strongly reduced with respect to its vacuum value , which is also borne out of recent lattice gauge calculations  @xcite .",
    "color - screening is characterized by the electric debye mass @xmath45 which we estimate to leading order in perturbation theory , @xmath46 . since , strictly speaking , perturbation theory is not really applicable under the moderate plasma temperatures expected even at rhic energies , we regard the strong coupling constant as an effective parameter to be adjusted to the @xmath0  data at sps . _ e.g. _ , with a typical @xmath47 , the @xmath0  binding energy at @xmath48  mev is @xmath49  mev decreasing to @xmath50  mev at @xmath51  mev and vanishing around @xmath52  mev .",
    "for such small binding energies , the photo - dissociation process becomes inefficient due to unfavorable break - up kinematics . for a loosely bound charmonium state , inelastic parton scattering , @xmath53 , turns out to be a more important mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the respective cross sections are evaluated in quasifree approximation using leading - order qcd for @xmath54 ( @xmath55 )  @xcite .",
    "the thermal dissociation rate is then obtained via @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the minimal on - shell momentum of a quark or gluon from the heat bath necessary to dissolve an in - medium charmonium bound state into a free @xmath10 pair .",
    "we include thermal quasiparticle masses for light quarks and gluons  @xcite , @xmath58 this formalism straightforwardly applies to @xmath7 and @xmath59 states as well . from the schrdinger equation , it follows  @xcite that their binding energy vanishes at or even below @xmath43 , which is also found in recent lattice calculations  @xcite . therefore , the pertinent qgp dissociation rate is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) with @xmath60 .",
    "the picture we have in mind here is similar in spirit to that underlying nuclear absorption : a pre - resonance state , characterized by a correlation induced in the primordial @xmath11-@xmath11 collision ( _ e.g. _ , comoving @xmath1 and @xmath61 quarks ) , is only destroyed if it actually undergoes an inelastic interaction with the surrounding matter .",

    "the quasifree process ( full line ) is more efficient in dissolving @xmath0 s than photo - dissociation ( dotted line ) . at higher temperatures",

    "close to @xmath43 , the vanishing binding energies for @xmath7 and @xmath59 entail lifetimes which are about a factor of three below the one for @xmath0-mesons .",
    "subsequent to quark - gluon plasma dissociation , when the system converts to the hadronic phase , charmonia undergo further suppression due to interactions with surrounding hadrons .",
    "there are a number of theoretical models for @xmath65 processes  @xcite whose results span an appreciable magnitude .",
    "calculations involving excited charmonia , such as @xmath7 and @xmath66 ( which contribute to the @xmath0  yield via electromagnetic feeddown ) , are scarce .",

    "one finds  @xcite , @xmath85 _ i.e. _ , the hadronic branching ratios are comparable or even below the radiative ones .",
    "this is in marked contradiction to vdm within which the latter are suppressed by a factor @xmath86 which is much smaller than the moderate increase in phase space due to the final state decay momenta ( also note that vdm is more strongly violated with increasing mass of the pseudoscalar meson ) .",

    "more dramatically , the composition in terms of underlying sources is very different : whereas at sps the ( suppressed ) direct yield dominates , @xmath0-mesons at rhic originate to @xmath1480% from thermal production ( being proportional to @xmath201 ) .",

    "[ fig : j_ncc ] ) , it saturates already for rather peripheral collisions at full rhic energy .",
    "note that the decrease of the thermal component for @xmath204 at sps is caused by canonical ensemble effects , while at rhic statistical production , for the most part , proceeds in the grand - canonical limit entailing a smooth increase with centrality .",
    "our approach thus clearly discriminates between standard @xmath0 suppression as opposed to thermal regeneration at full rhic energy .",

    "@xcite ) .    for practical purposes ,",
    "it is also of interest to convert our results into an absolute number of @xmath0 s predicted for rhic . keeping in mind the uncertainties mentioned above , we find that the combined statistical and direct @xmath0  yield amounts to rapidity density @xmath205x@xmath206 for central collisions at full rhic energy .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath0 dissolution in a qgp dates back to the late 70 s / early 80 s and has been discussed in many facets . in our approach , we have combined an in - medium reduced binding energy with parton - induced destruction , which we have treated in quasifree approximation due to small ( if any ) binding energies of the various charmonium states .",
    "the latter feature is also the main origin of the rather strong suppression we find using rather moderate values of the strong coupling constant , @xmath207 , which , of course , is to be regarded as an effective parameter which we adjusted to describe the na50 data . due to a @xmath1420% contribution from statistical @xmath0 production at sps energies ,",
    "our qgp suppression required to reproduce the na50 data is stronger than in calculations based on the suppression effect alone . on the other hand , within the quasifree approximation ,",
    "the discrimination between different charmonia is less pronounced than within `` threshold''-type approaches where higher charmonium states are completely suppressed once the qgp temperature exceeds the relevant value .",
    "concerning the evaluation of thermal ( statistical ) recombination , our approach parallels the one initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is based on an open - charm abundance generated by hard production , available for recombination at @xmath43 .",
    "the main difference to these analyses is that we do not invoke an enhancement of open - charm production beyond standard extrapolations of @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions ( also , we include corrections from incomplete thermalization of charm quarks in relaxation time approximation ) .",
    "such an enhancement is needed if one aims at describing the na50 data in terms of thermal production alone ( assuming that directly produced charmonia have been completely dissolved ) .",
    "the na50 suppression pattern towards more peripheral collisions then emerges as a canonical ensemble effect , requiring `` anomalous '' open - charm enhancement factors of around @xmath208  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , such an increase in hard production in a heavy - ion environment is not easily justified .",
    "also , the na38 findings on the intermediate - mass dimuon excess  @xcite allow for a maximal open - charm enhancement of a factor of @xmath143 for central collisions ( less for peripheral ) .",
    "furthermore , imposing statistical production on small - size systems ( or even @xmath18-@xmath19 reactions ) eventually contradicts nuclear absorption systematics .",
    "finally we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0 abundance in an expanding qgp has been evaluated using rate equations with gluon photodissociation and its reverse reaction as microscopic input . the space - time evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite occurs entirely within the qgp phase , and in - medium modifications to the @xmath0 binding energy have not been applied .",
    "consequently , the time evolution of @xmath0  formation in that approach is quite different from our results , leaning towards early production  @xcite , which also entails substantially larger results for the final @xmath8 ratio , reaching values of up to @xmath209-@xmath210x@xmath211 for central @xmath17-@xmath17 at @xmath212=200  gev .",
    "this is a factor of 5 - 8 larger than our estimates , cf .",

    "in summary , we have developed a two - component model for charmonium production in heavy - ion collisions within a comprehensive thermal evolution scenario .",
    "the two sources of charmonium production are ( i ) `` direct '' @xmath0 s , arising from primordial @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions , subjected to nuclear , qgp and hadronic suppression , as well as ( ii ) statistical recombination of @xmath1 and @xmath61 quarks at the hadronization transition subjected to hadronic dissociation only .",
    "the qgp dissociation of contribution ( i ) has been evaluated using in - medium charmonium binding energies which led us to introduce `` quasifree '' destruction as the dominant suppression mechanism .",
    "inelastic hadronic interactions have been estimated within earlier proposed effective lagrangian approaches , and turned out to give very moderate corrections ( up to 10% for excited charmonium states ) .",
    "contribution ( ii ) has been based on open - charm abundances as inferred from @xmath11-@xmath11 collisions ( without `` anomalous '' enhancement ) , and incomplete thermalization has been incorporated via a relaxation time approximation . taken together , with an effective strong coupling constant as a single parameter , the measured centrality dependence of @xmath0 production at the sps can be reasonably well described .",
    "a potential discrepancy has been identified in the @xmath6 ratio , which we believe to reside in shortcomings of the calculations for hadronic @xmath7 dissociation .",
    "the latter is difficult to assess in purely hadronic models and might well be underestimated .",
