    "the motivation for investigating the low energy @xmath4 interaction is closely connected with understanding of the nature of scalar resonances @xmath6(980 ) and @xmath7(980 ) . besides the interpretation as @xmath8 mesons  @xcite",
    ", these particles were also proposed to be @xmath9 tetraquark states  @xcite , hybrid @xmath8/meson - meson systems  @xcite or even quark - less gluonic hadrons  @xcite . since both @xmath6(980 ) and @xmath7(980 )",
    "masses are very close to the sum of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 masses , they are considered also as @xmath2 bound states  @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath2 interaction is a crucial quantity regarding the formation of such molecules .",
    "+ the @xmath4 interaction was studied experimentally inter alia in the @xmath3 reaction with cosy11 and anke detectors operating at the cosy synchrotron in jlich in germany .",
    "the experimental data collected systematically below  @xcite and above  @xcite the @xmath12 meson threshold revealed a significant enhancement in the shape of the excitation function near the kinematical threshold . on the other hand , despite the search done by the cosy11 experiment  @xcite and analysis based on big data samples collected by anke and wasa  at  cosy experiments , there is no clear evidence of the @xmath4 pairs production through the @xmath6(980 ) or @xmath7(980 ) resonances . the enhancement of the excitation function near the threshold may be due to the final state interaction ( fsi ) in the @xmath13 system . indeed , the differential spectra obtained by the cosy-11  @xcite and anke  @xcite groups indicate a strong interaction in the @xmath14 an @xmath15 subsystems . the phenomenological model proposed by the anke collaboration based on the factorization of the final state interaction into interactions in the @xmath16 and @xmath14 subsystems allowed to describe the experimental @xmath14 an @xmath15 invariant mass distributions assuming an effective @xmath14 scattering length @xmath17  fm  @xcite .",
    "however , the data very close to the kinematical threshold remain underestimated , which indicates that in the low energy region the influence of the @xmath18 final state interaction may be significant  @xcite . motivated by this observation",
    "the cosy11 collaboration has estimated the scattering length of the @xmath18 interaction based for the first time on the low energy @xmath19 goldhaber plot distributions measured at excess energies of q  =  10  mev and 28  mev  @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we present preliminary results of the @xmath4fsi studies combining the goldhaber plot distributions established by the cosy11 group with the experimental excitation function near threshold .",
    "the final state interaction model used in the presented analysis is was based on the factorization ansatz mentioned before , with an additional term describing the interaction of the @xmath4 pair ( the @xmath20 interaction was neglected since it has to be found weak  @xcite ) .",
    "we have assumed that the overall enhancement factor originating from final state interaction can be factorized into enhancements in the proton ",
    "proton , the two @xmath14 and the @xmath4 subsystems : @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the relative momentum of particles in the corresponding subsystem .",
