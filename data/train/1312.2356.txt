    "the efficient use of material and related to that the optimization of shapes and topology is of high importance for the performance of structures .",
    "many different methods have been introduced to solve shape and topology optimization problems and we refer to bendsoe , sigmund @xcite , sokolowski , zolesio @xcite and allaire , jouve , toader @xcite for details . in this paper",
    "we analyze a multi - phase field approach for shape and topology optimization problems .",
    "this approach is related to perimeter penalizing methods .",
    "however , instead of the perimeter the ginzburg - landau energy @xmath1 is added to the objective functional . in ( [ ginzburg - landau - energy ] )",
    "the set @xmath2 is a given design domain , the function @xmath3 which takes values in @xmath4 is a phase field vector , @xmath5 is a potential function with absolute minima which describe the different materials and the void and @xmath6 is a small parameter related to the interface thickness . it can be shown that ( [ ginzburg - landau - energy ] ) converges in the sense of @xmath7limits to the perimeter functional , see modica @xcite .",
    "the phase field method has been introduced in topology optimization by bourdin and chambolle @xcite and was subsequently used by burger , stainko @xcite , wang , zhou @xcite , takezawa , nishiwaki , kitamura @xcite , ded , borden , hughes @xcite , blank et al @xcite and penzler , rumpf , wirth @xcite .",
    "however , so far a rigorous derivation of first order conditions and an analysis of these conditions in the sharp interface limit @xmath8 was missing . in this paper",
    "we not only discuss recent progress in this direction but also introduce and analyze a new efficient method to solve the constrained minimization problem .",
    "although in principle the phase field approach can as well be used for other shape and topology optimization problems we restrict ourselves to situations where we seek a domain @xmath9 and a displacement @xmath10 such that @xmath11 or an @xmath12error to a target displacement @xmath13 is minimized subject to the equations of linear elasticity . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are volume and surface forces and @xmath16 is a given weight function on @xmath2 .",
    "the optimization problem ( [ meanc ] ) is a mean compliance minimization problem and ( [ compl ] ) is an example of a compliant mechanism problem , see @xcite for details . in this contribution",
    "we will be brief and refer to @xcite and to the forthcoming article @xcite for details .",
    "in this section we introduce how structural topology optimization problems can be formulated within the phase field approach .    the goal in multi - material shape and topology",
    "optimization is to partition a given bounded lipschitz design domain @xmath17 into regions occupied by either void or by @xmath18 different materials such that a given cost functional is minimized subject to given constraints . within the phase field approach we describe the different material distributions with the help of a phase field vector @xmath19 , where @xmath20 describes the fraction of void and @xmath21 describe the fractions of the @xmath18 different materials .",
    "the phase field approach allows for a certain mixing between materials and between materials and void but the mixing will be restricted to a small interfacial region . in order to ensure that the phase field vector @xmath22 describes fractions",
    "we require that @xmath23 lies pointwise in the gibbs simplex @xmath24 in this work we prescribe the total spatial amount of the material fractions through @xmath25 , where it is assumed that @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and where @xmath29 denotes the mean value on @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that in principal inequality constraints for @xmath29 can also be dealt with .",
    "the potential @xmath30 is assumed to have global minima at the unit vectors @xmath31 , @xmath28 , which correspond to the different materials and to the void .    in ( [ ginzburg - landau - energy ] )",
    "we choose an obstacle potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is smooth and @xmath34 is the indicator function of the gibbs - simplex @xmath35 .",
    "introducing @xmath36 and @xmath37 we obtain @xmath38 and on @xmath39 we have @xmath40 .",
    "we describe the elastic deformation with the help of the displacement vector @xmath41 and with the strain tensor @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary @xmath43 is divided into a dirichlet part @xmath44 , a non - homogeneous neumann part @xmath45 and a homogeneous neumann part @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath47 is the elasticity tensor , @xmath48 is the volume force and @xmath49 are boundary forces .",

    "the well - posedness of ( [ mean - compliance ] ) can be shown by using the lax - milgram lemma and korn s inequality , for details see @xcite .",
    "+ summarized , the structural optimization problem can be formulated as : + given @xmath66 and measurable sets @xmath67 , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , we want to solve @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and the functional for the compliant mechanism is given by @xmath75 with a given non - negative weighting factor @xmath76 fulfilling @xmath77 .",
    "+ the existence of a minimizer to @xmath78 is shown by classical techniques of the calculus of variations in @xcite .    from the applicational point of view",
    "it might be desirable to fix material or void in some regions of the design domain , so the condition @xmath79 makes sense . moreover by choosing @xmath80 such that @xmath81 we can ensure that it is not possible to choose only void on the support of @xmath82 , i.e. in ( [ push - functional ] ) we ensure @xmath83 .",
    "in order to derive first - order necessary optimality conditions for the optimization problem @xmath78 , it is essential to show the differentiability of the control - to - state operator , which is well - defined because of the well - posedness of ( [ mean - compliance ] ) .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ gateaux - diff ] can be found in @xcite .    with theorem [ gateaux - diff ] at hand",
    ", we can now derive first order conditions .",
    "indeed , it follows from the chain rule that the reduced cost functional @xmath94 is frchet differentiable at every @xmath95 with the frchet derivative @xmath96 .",
    "here we have to assume that @xmath97 in case of @xmath98 .",
    "owing to the convexity of @xmath99 , we have for every minimizer @xmath100 of @xmath101 in @xmath99 that @xmath102 .",

    "[ optsys ] let @xmath103 denote a minimizer of the problem @xmath78 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 are the corresponding state and adjoint variables , respectively .",

    "in this section we present the sharp interface limit of the optimality system given in theorem [ optsys ] ; for a detailed derivation of the sharp interface limit using the method of formally matched asymptotic expansions we refer to @xcite .",
    "we now consider a more concrete form of the @xmath23-dependent elasticity tensor .",
    "we choose the elasticity tensor starting with constant elasticity tensors @xmath110 which are defined in the pure materials , i.e. when @xmath111 , and model the void as a very soft material .",
    "as mentioned , a possible choice of the elasticity tensor in the void is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a fixed elasticity tensor . in order to model the elastic properties also in the interfacial region the elasticity tensor",
    "is assumed to be a tensor valued function @xmath114 which interpolate between @xmath115 .",
    "furthermore we assume that the weighting factor @xmath82 in the compliant mechanism functional @xmath116 is a smooth function .",
    "+ the asymptotic analysis gives that the phase field functions converge as @xmath117 tends to zero to a limit function @xmath23 which only takes values in @xmath118 .",
    "this implies that the domain @xmath2 is partitioned into @xmath119 regions @xmath120 , which are separated by interfaces @xmath121 .",

    "we remark that the terms involving @xmath86 and @xmath142 generalize the eshelby traction known from materials science , see @xcite .",
    "in addition for all @xmath143 it holds @xmath144 above the lagrange multipliers @xmath145 sum up to zero and they are related to volume constraints @xmath146 which are obtained from the integral constraints @xmath147 in the sharp interface limit .",
    "+ in case that void and two or more materials appear junction points emerge , where e.g. void and two materials meet , see e.g. figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , and it might be desirable in applications to influence the angles at the junctions . by an appropriate choice of the potential @xmath5 the angles at the junctions can be prescribed , see @xcite for details .    in the case of one material we recover the classical first order conditions for the sharp interface structural optimization problem , see e.g. allaire , jouve , toader @xcite .",
    "the conditions we derived above generalize the first order conditions in @xcite to the multi - phase case .",
    "in the previous section we studied the ginzburg - landau energy with an obstacle potential which leads to an optimization problem with inequality constraints . using instead a smooth potential would lead to equality constraints only which are usually easier to handle .",
    "however , there is a subtle problem , namely , we can not prescribe the total spatial amount of the material by @xmath148 since the identification of pure @xmath149-th - material with @xmath150 does not hold any longer but the value attained in phase @xmath149 depends on @xmath151 . only in the limit for @xmath152",

    "[ smoothy ] the shift of one phase is presented for a numerical experiment .",
    "the listed values are the values in areas where the values stay nearly constant , reflecting a pure phase .",
    "therefore , the @xmath149-th material does not have approximately volume @xmath155 by prescribing @xmath156 .",
    "consequently one has to use the obstacle potential or the spatial amount has to be modelled in a different way .",
    "the following three figures [ fig : longbeam]-[fig : fig2 ] illustrate some results for a long cantilever beam with one material , for a case with three materials and void and an example for a cantilever beam in 3d with one material .",
    "in this section we present a compliant mechanism simulation , in particular we set @xmath157 in @xmath78 .",
    "the configuration we consider is depicted in figure [ push_pic ] , where zero dirichlet boundary conditions are posed on the left and right boundaries at the top and bottom and horizontal forces are applied at sections along the left and right boundaries .    in order to solve the gradient inequality ( gi ) in theorem [ optsys ] , we use here as a first numerical approach a classical @xmath12-gradient flow dynamic for the reduced cost functional .",
    "the gradient flow yields the following parabolic variational inequality for all @xmath158 and all @xmath159 : @xmath160 in addition , @xmath86 and @xmath130 have to solve the state equation ( se ) and the adjoint equation ( ae ) , see theorem [ optsys ] .",
