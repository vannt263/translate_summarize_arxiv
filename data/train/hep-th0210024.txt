    "the discovery of the @xmath3 meson and its decay may be considered as one of the events for the birth of particle physics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 meson is interesting in that its structure is simpler than other hadrons but its formation and decay has already involved both the strong and weak interactions . in this paper",
    "we first propose a quantum knot model of the @xmath0 mesons . in this knot model",
    "we show the formation of the @xmath0 mesons by strong interaction and and the weak decay @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 mesons are modeled by the prime knot @xmath1 which is assigned with the prime number @xmath2 .",
    "this quantum knot model is derived from a quantum gauge model which is similar to the qcd gauge model .    in this knot model of @xmath3 we give a mass machanism for the generation of the masses of the @xmath3 meson , the muon @xmath6 and the muon neutrino @xmath7 .",
    "this mechanism of generating mass supersedes the conventional mechanism of generating mass through the higgs particles and makes hypothesizing the existence of the higgs particles unnecessary .",
    "this perhaps explains why we can not physically find such higgs particles .",
    "the computed masses of @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 are 135 mev , 140 mev and 105 mev respectively ; while the corresponding observed masses are 135 mev , 140 mev and 105.7 mev respectively .",
    "it was a mystery how the mass of the @xmath34 particle comes out in the weak interaction of the @xmath35 meson .",
    "our computation of the mass of the @xmath34 particle using the mathematical structure of the knot model of the @xmath35 meson is an evidence that mesons are modeled as knots .",
    "we then extend the knot model to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "we give a mass mechanism for the generation of the masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons and the masses of the anti - particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we show that the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons are modeled by the prime knot @xmath10 ( which is assigned with the prime number @xmath11 ) while the anti - particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 are modeled by the mirror image of @xmath10 .",
    "we show that the strange degree of freedom of the strange quark is from the linking of knots of the @xmath14 mesons .",
    "this linking gives the strong interaction for the associated production of elementary particles with strangeness .",
    "we then extend the knot model to the two nonets of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons which include the mesons @xmath36 and @xmath37 which are modeled by the prime knots @xmath17 respectively and these prime knots @xmath18 are assigned with the prime numbers @xmath19 respectively .",
    "then we also give a knot model to the scalar mesons @xmath38 and @xmath39 and we show that the four mesons @xmath40 and @xmath39 are closedly related in that they are modeled with the same prime knot @xmath41 which is assigned with the prime number @xmath42 .",
    "thus we have that the basic pseudoscalar and vector mesons : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are modeled by the prime knots : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 which are indexed by the consecutative prime numbers : @xmath50 appearing in the mass formula of these mesons ( we shall show from the quantum knot theory in this paper that the prime numbers @xmath51 and the corresponding prime knots @xmath52 are not used for the modeling of mesons ) .",
    "this list of consecutative prime numbers for the modeling of the basic pseudoscalar and vector mesons is thus an evidence for that mesons are modeled as knots .    from this knot model",
    "we have a mass formula for computing the masses of the basic pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the result of computation is given by the following table of classification of mesons ( this mass formula is different from the gell - mann - okubo mass formula while there are some relations with the gell - mann - okubo mass formula @xcite-@xcite ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the above table the quantum numbers @xmath53 are determined by a quantum condition which is derived from the structure of the group @xmath54 and the winding number of the knot model of mesons ; and the quantum numbers @xmath55 are as quantum states of the strange quarks .",
    "this classification of mesons is between mesons and prime knots and is established by the corresponding prime numbers where prime knots are classified by prime numbers by the following table @xcite : @xmath56 where the prime knot @xmath57 is assigned with the number @xmath58 while it is similar to the prime number @xmath59 @xcite .    from the above classification of mesons we have the following relation for the two nonets of pseudoscalar and vector mesons : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are related by the quantum number @xmath63 ; @xmath62 and @xmath64 are related by the prime knot @xmath48 and prime number @xmath65 ; @xmath64 and @xmath66 are related by the quantum number @xmath67 ; @xmath66 and @xmath68 are related by the strangeness ; @xmath69 and @xmath37 are related by the quantum number @xmath70 ; @xmath37 and @xmath71 are related by the prime knot @xmath41 and prime number @xmath42 ; and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related by the quantum number @xmath73 .    from this knot model of mesons we also show that the phenomeon of the generations of quarks is derived from the property of knots .",
    "we show that the @xmath74-mesons and @xmath75-mesons ( where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the up and down quarks ) such as the @xmath5 and @xmath78 mesons are modeled by prime knots from the two families @xmath79 and @xmath80 of prime knots with four and six crossings respectively .",
    "thus the generation of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 quarks is from the two families @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then we show that the @xmath81-mesons ( where @xmath82 denotes the strange quark ) such as the @xmath37 meson is modeled by prime knots from the family @xmath83 of prime knots with seven crossings .",
    "then we show that the @xmath84-mesons ( where @xmath85 denotes the charm quark ) such as the @xmath86 meson is modeled by prime knots from the family @xmath87 of prime knots with eight crossings .",
    "thus the generation of the @xmath82 and @xmath85 quarks is from the families @xmath83 and @xmath87 of prime knots with seven and eight crossings respectively .",
    "continuing in this way we have that the generations of quarks is derived from the property of knots .",
    "this is thus an evidence for that mesons are modeled as knots .",
    "we the extend the knot model to the basic octet , decuplet and singlet of baryons which include the baryons @xmath20 , @xmath88 ; @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we show that these baryons are modeled by the prime knots @xmath25 ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively where @xmath28 are assigned with the prime numbers @xmath29 respectively .",
    "these prime numbers @xmath89 appear in the mass formula of these baryons .",
    "we notice that the sequence @xmath89 can be regarded as a sequence of consecutive prime numbers for modeling baryons because the missing prime number @xmath65 is assigned to the prime knot @xmath48 which is an amphichiral knot with the property that it is identified to its mirror image and thus is not suitable to model baryons which are not identified to their anti - particles .",
    "this is thus an evidence that baryons are modeled as knots .    for the baryons",
    "@xmath90 we introduce a pure strange degree of freedom which is from a @xmath91 matrix of representing knots on @xmath92 and this @xmath91 matrix is a linking effect of knots .",
    "this linking effect gives the strong interaction between two elementary particles and gives the associated production property for strong interactions producing particles with the strange quark @xmath82 such as the interaction @xmath93 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we show that the weak interaction can also be described by this quantum knot model .",
    "when the gauge group is @xmath94 this quantum knot model and the corresponding quantum gauge model is analogous to the usual electroweak theory @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . from this knot modeling of strong and weak interactions",
    "we show that the strong and weak interactions are closedly related .",
    "the basic relation of the strong and weak interactions can be stated as follows .",
    "we have that a meson ( or a baryon ) is modeled by a representation of the form @xmath30 .",
    "this is as the strong interaction for forming the meson ( or the baryon ) .",
    "then two components @xmath33 of @xmath32 may be separated such that they are still attached to @xmath31 in the form that they are attached to @xmath31 at two different positions of the quantum knot @xmath31 .",
    "this process of separation is identified as the weak interaction of the two quarks ( or leptons ) represented by the two components @xmath33 of @xmath32 .",
    "this is as the basic relation of the strong and weak interactions .",
    "we shall also show that the strength of the strong and weak interactions are closedly related .",
    "during the process of the weak interaction we have that the components @xmath33 representing the up and down quarks are separated but are still attached to the quantum knot for representing the @xmath95 meson . at this intermediate state with the up and down quarks being separated the quantum knot and the attached components @xmath96 no longer represent the @xmath95 meson but is as a new particle which is identified as the gauge particle @xmath97 .",
    "similarly we also have the knot modeling of the gauge particle @xmath98 for the weak interaction of neutral currents .    in this knot modeling of strong and weak interactions we can also model the parity @xmath99 operation and the charge conjugation @xmath100 .",
    "we have that the @xmath0 mesons are modeled by the prime knot @xmath1 .",
    "this prime knot @xmath46 is an amphichiral knot which equals to its mirror image .",
    "we show that this property of knot gives the spontaneous symmetry breaking for forming the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we show that this spontaneous symmetry breaking gives the parity @xmath99 violation , the charge conjugation @xmath100 violation , and the @xmath101 violation of weak interaction .    this quantum knot model also explains quarks fractional charges and the phenomenon of quark confinement and asymptotic freedom of strong interaction .",
    "thus we conclude that the strong interaction of quarks for forming mesons and baryons is just the quantum knot modeling of mesons and baryons .",
    "we remark that the quantum gauge model for deriving this quantum knot model of elementary particles is not based on the four dimensional space - time but is based on the one dimensional proper time ( we shall describe this quantum gauge model in the next section ) .",
    "then since knots are of three dimensional nature though this quantum gauge model is not based on the three dimensional space we have that the three dimensional nature of matters ( and thus the three dimensional space ) naturally comes out from this quantum gauge model .",
    "this also shows that why the physical space is three dimensional .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of a quantum gauge model of electrodynamics and its nonabelian generalization .",
    "we shall first consider a nonabelian generalization with a @xmath94 gauge symmetry which will be for the strong and weak interaction of mesons . with this quantum model",
    "we introduce the generalized wilson loop for the construction of the mesons . to investigate the properties of the wilson loop in section 3 we derive a chiral symmetry from the gauge symmetry of this quantum model .",
    "from this chiral symmetry in section 4 we derive a conformal field theory which includes an affine kac - moody algebra and a quantum knizhnik - zamolodchikov ( kz ) equation .",
    "a main point of our model on the quantum kz equation is that we can derive two kz equations which are dual to each other .",
    "this duality is the main point for the wilson loop to be exactly solvable and to have a winding property which gives properties of the elementary particles .",
    "since this quantum kz equation is derived from the quantum gauge model by calculus of variation we can regard it as a quantum euler - lagrange equation or a quantum yang - mills equation .",
    "we then in section 5 to section 9 represent knots by the generalized wilson loops which are constructed from the quantum kz equation .    then from section 10 to section 12 we use the generalized wilson loop which is as a quantum knot to give the properties of the @xmath0 mesons and to give a mass mechanism for generating masses of the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we give a mass mechanism for generating the masses of @xmath3 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 where we show that the neutrino @xmath7 is without charge and without mass .",
    "then from section 13 to section 17 we use the generalized wilson loop which is as a quantum knot to give the properties of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "then in section 18 we show that the phenomeon of the generations of quarks is derived from the property of knots .",
    "then in section 19 we show that the @xmath0 mesons modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 and that @xmath46 being an amphichiral knot give the @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 violation .",
    "then in section 20 we show in more detail that this quantum knot modeling is just the required strong and weak interactions and that strong and weak interactions are closedly related .",
    "this gives the unification of the electromagnetic , the weak and the strong interactions . in section 21",
    "we give the knot model of the gauge particles @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "then in section 22 and section 23 we use the gauge symmetry @xmath102 and the generalized wilson loop which is as a quantum knot to give the knot models of baryons .",
    "let us construct a quantum gauge model , as follows . in probability theory",
    "we have the wiener measure @xmath103 which is a measure on the space @xmath104 $ ] of continuous functions @xcite .",
    "this measure is a well defined mathematical theory for the brownian motion and it may be symbolically written in the following form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the energy integral of the brownian particle and @xmath107 is symbolically a product of lebesgue measures @xmath108 and @xmath109 is a normalized constant .",
    "once the wiener measure is defined we may then define other measures on @xmath104 $ ] as follows@xcite .",
    "let a potential term @xmath110 be added to @xmath111 .",
    "then we have a measure @xmath112 on @xmath104 $ ] defined by : @xmath113 under some condition on @xmath114 we have that @xmath112 is well defined on @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "let us call ( [ wiener2 ] ) as the feymann - kac formula @xcite .",
    "let us then follow this formula to construct a quantum model of electrodynamics , as follows .",
    "similar to the formula ( [ wiener2 ] ) we construct a quantum model of electrodynamics from the following energy integral : @xmath115ds \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] where the complex variable @xmath116 and the real variables @xmath117 and @xmath118 are continuous functions in a form that they are in terms of an arbitrary ( continuously differentiable ) closed curve @xmath119 in the complex plane where @xmath82 is a parameter representing the proper time in relativity ( we shall also write @xmath120 in the complex variable form @xmath121 ) . the complex variable @xmath116 represents a field of matter ( such as the electron ) ( @xmath122 denotes its complex conjugate ) and the real variables @xmath117 and @xmath118 represent a connection ( or the gauge field of the photon ) and @xmath123 denotes the ( bare ) electric charge .",
    "the integral ( [ 1.1 ] ) has the following gauge symmetry : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a continuously differentiable real - valued function of @xmath126 .",
    "we remark that this qed model is similar to the usual yang - mills gauge models . a feature of ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "is that it is not formulated with the four - dimensional space - time but is formulated with the one dimensional proper time .",
    "this one dimensional nature let this qed model avoid the usual utraviolet divergence difficulty of quantum fields .",
    "as most of the theories in physics are formulated with the space - time let us give reasons of this formulation .",
    "we know that with the concept of space - time we have a convenient way to understand physical phenomena and to formulate theories such as the newton equation , the schroedinger equation , e.t.c . to describe these physical phenomena .",
    "however we also know that there are fundamental difficulties related to space - time such as the utraviolet divergence difficulty of quantum field theory . to solve these difficulties let us reexamine the concept of space - time .",
    "we propose that the space - time is a statistical concept which is not as basic as the proper time in relativity .",
    "because a statistical theory is usually a convenient but incomplete description of a more basic theory this means that some difficulties may appear if we formulate a physical theory with the space - time .",
    "this also means that a way to formulate a basic theory of physics is to formulate it not with the space - time but with the proper time only as the parameter for evolution .",
    "this is a reason that we use ( [ 1.1 ] ) to formulate a qed theory . in this formulation",
    "we regard the proper time as an independent parameter for evolution . from ( [",
    "1.1 ] ) we may obtain the conventional results in terms of space - time by introducing the space - time as a statistical method .",
    "let us explain in more detail how the space - time comes out as a statistics . for statistical purpose",
    "when many electrons ( or many photons ) present we introduce space - time @xmath127 as a statistical method to write @xmath128 in the form @xmath129 we notice that for a given @xmath130 there may have many @xmath131 and @xmath132 which correspond to many electrons ( or photons ) such that ( [ lorentz ] ) holds . in this way the space - time is introduced as a statistics . by ( [ lorentz ] )",
    "we may ( and we shall in elsewhere ) derive statistical formulas for many electrons ( or photons ) from formulas obtained from ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "in this way we may obtain the dirac equation as a statistical equation for electrons and the maxwell equation as a statistical equation for photons . in this way we may regard the usual qed theory as the statistical extension of this qed model .",
    "this statistical interpretation of the usual qed theory is thus an explanation of the mystery that the usual qed theory is so successful in the computation of quantum effects of electromagnetic interaction while it has the difficulty of ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we notice that the relation ( [ lorentz ] ) is the famous lorentz metric ( we may generalize it to other metric in general relativity ) . here our understanding of the lorentz",
    "metric is that it is a statistical formula where the proper time @xmath82 is more fundamental than the space - time @xmath127 in the sense that we first have the proper time and the space - time is introduced via the lorentz metric only for the purpose of statistics .",
    "this reverses the order of appearance of the proper time and the space - time in the history of relativity in which we first have the concept of space - time and then we have the concept of proper time which is introduced via the lorentz metric .",
    "once we understand that the space - time is a statistical concept from ( [ 1.1 ] ) we can give a solution to the quantum measurement problem in the debate about quantum mechanics between bohr and einstein .",
    "in this debate bohr insisted that with the probability interpretation quantum mechanics is very successful . on",
    "the other hand einstein insisted that quantum mechanics is incomplete because of probability interpretation .",
    "here we may solve this debate by constructing the above qed model which is a quantum theory as the quantum mechanics and unlike quantum mechanics which needs probability interpretation we have that this qed model is deterministic since it is not formulated with the space - time .",
    "similar to the usual yang - mills gauge theory we can generalize this gauge model with @xmath133 gauge symmetry to nonabelian gauge models . as an illustration",
    "let us consider @xmath94 gauge symmetry where @xmath94 denotes the direct product of the groups @xmath54 and @xmath133 .",
    "this @xmath94 gauge symmetry is for the knot model of mesons .",
    "we shall later consider the @xmath102 gauge symmetry which is for the knot model of baryons .",
    "similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) we consider the following energy integral : @xmath134ds \\label{n1}\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is a two dimensional complex vector ; @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes a component of a gauge field @xmath139 ; @xmath140 denotes a generator of @xmath94 where @xmath141 denotes a self - adjoint generator of @xmath94 and @xmath123 denotes the bare electric charge for general interactions including the strong and weak interaction ( here for simplicity we choose a convention that the complex @xmath142 is absorbed by @xmath143 ) ; and @xmath144 , @xmath137 . from ( [ n1 ] ) we can develop a nonabelian gauge model as similar to that for the above abelian gauge model .",
    "we have that ( [ n1 ] ) is invariant under the following gauge transformation : @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we shall mainly consider the case that @xmath148 is a function of the form @xmath149 where @xmath150 are analytic functions of @xmath126 ( we let @xmath151 and we write @xmath152 ) .",
    "the above gauge model is based on the banach space @xmath153 of continuous functions @xmath154 on the one dimensional interval @xmath155 . since @xmath156 is positive and",
    "the model is one dimensional ( and thus is simpler than the usual two dimensional yang - mills gauge model ) we have that this gauge model is similar to the wiener measure except that this gauge model has a gauge symmetry .",
    "this gauge symmetry gives a degenerate degree of freedom . in the physics literature",
    "the usual way to treat the degenerate degree of freedom of gauge symmetry is to introduce a gauge fixing condition to eliminate the degenerate degree of freedom where each gauge fixing will give equivalent physical results @xcite .",
    "there are various gauge fixing conditions such as the lorentz gauge condition , the feynman gauge condition , etc .",
    "we shall later in section [ sec6 ] ( on the kac - moody algebra ) adopt a gauge fixing condition for the above gauge model .",
    "this gauge fixing condition will also be used to derive the quantum kz equation in dual form which will be regarded as a quantum yang - mill equation since its role will be similar to the classical yang - mill equation derived from the classical yang - mill gauge model .",
    "similar to the wilson loop in quantum field theory @xcite from our quantum model we introduce an analogue of wilson loop , as follows ( we shall also call a wilson loop as a dirac - wilson loop ) .",
    "* definition*. a classical wilson loop @xmath157 is defined by : @xmath158 where @xmath159 denotes a representation of @xmath54 ; @xmath160 is a fixed curve where the quantum gauge models are based on it as specified in the above section . as usual the notation @xmath99 in the definition of @xmath157 denotes a path - ordered product @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "let us give some remarks on the above definition of wilson loop , as follows .",

    "thus we shall call the generalized wilson loops as quantum knots .",
    "we shall model the mesons by using these quantum knots .",

    "this agrees with the fact that the prime number @xmath59 does not appear in the above mass formula for the computation of the masses of mesons .",

    "we have that the @xmath5 meson is modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 which is an amphichiral knot and is assigned with the prime number @xmath2 .",

    "thus there are two degrees of freedom for forming the quark model of the @xmath5 meson .",

    "continuing in this way this shows that the phenomeon of the generations of quarks is derived from the properties of knots .",
    "this is an evidence that elementary particles are modeled as knots .",
    "let us first consider the well known @xmath766 puzzle : @xmath767 where the particles @xmath768 are identified as the same meson @xmath9 for solving this puzzle .",
    "the solving of this puzzle gives the well known parity @xmath99 violation of weak interaction @xcite@xcite .",
    "let us here give the knot modeling of this @xmath99 violation of weak interaction and the @xmath101 violation of the following weak interaction @xcite : @xmath769    we shall show that since the figure - eight knot @xmath46 is an amphichiral knot that it equals to its mirror image and that @xmath0 mesons are modeled by @xmath46 we have the @xmath99 violation and @xmath101 violation of weak interaction . in this knot modeling of weak interaction",

    "further this phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking may be observed in a weak interaction which is a slow interaction such that it may have enough time for the appearing of this phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking . now we have that the @xmath5 meson is produced in the weak interaction ( [ cp2 ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath101 violation of this weak interaction ( [ cp2 ] ) is the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath5 meson given by the chosen of one of the quantum states : @xmath785 $ ] of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "this shows that the @xmath101 violation of the weak interaction ( [ cp2 ] ) is due to that the @xmath5 meson is modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 which is with the special property that it is an amphichiral knot .",
    "we remark that in the weak interaction ( [ cp2 ] ) we identify the @xmath782 meson as the following meson @xmath786 which in the knot modeling is with @xmath787 , @xmath788 and @xmath789 .",
    "this is more appropriate as a meson with longer life than the meson @xmath790 which is regarded as the @xmath782 meson in the literature @xcite-@xcite ( in the literature the meson @xmath791 is also defined to with @xmath789 ) .",
    "this is because that the @xmath12 meson is the anti - particle of @xmath8 and if these two particles combineed in the symmetric form @xmath792 then these two particles would quickly annihilate each other and thus the meson @xmath791 would be with shorter life .    as another example of weak interaction let us then consider the knot modeling of the @xmath99 violation of the @xmath766 puzzle ( [ cp1 ] ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "let us consider the following meson : @xmath793 in this knot modeling this meson is with @xmath787 while the @xmath9 is not an eigenstate of @xmath99 .",
    "we see that this @xmath794 meson and the weak interaction ( [ cp1 ] ) is completely analogous to the above example of the @xmath782 meson and the weak interaction ( [ cp2 ] ) .",
    "thus in this knot modeling it is more appropriate to regard @xmath794 rather than @xmath9 as the @xmath766 particle ( in the literature the meson @xmath9 is defined to with @xmath787 @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "again as analyzed in the above we have that whenever a @xmath3 meson is produced in an interaction the left - right symmetry is spontaneously broken by the chosen of one of the quantum states : @xmath785 $ ] .",
    "further this phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking may be observed in a weak interaction which is a slow interaction such that it may have enough time for the appearing of this phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking . now we have that the @xmath3 meson is produced in the weak interaction ( [ cp1 ] ) .",

    "this shows that the @xmath99 violation of the weak interaction ( [ cp1 ] ) is due to that the @xmath3 meson is modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 which is with the special property that it is an amphichiral knot .    in summary from this knot modeling of weak interaction",
    "we conclude that the @xmath99 violation , the @xmath100 violation and the @xmath101 violation in weak interactions are all due to the appearing of a meson ( such as the @xmath0 mesons ) which is modeled by an amphichiral knot ( where the @xmath0 mesons are modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 ) which is with the special property that it is equal to its mirror image .",
    "let us investigate in more detail why the above knot modeling of the interaction ( [ sw4 ] ) starting from the gauge fixing @xmath499 is the modeling of the weak decay of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "let us use this knot modeling to give a rough estimate of the strength of this interaction ( [ sw4 ] ) to show that the strength of this interaction is consistent with the strength of the weak interaction .",
    "first we have that the strength of qed is the fine structure constant @xmath795 and we have @xmath796 .",
    "let us suppose that the charge for the electromagnetic interaction , the weak interaction and the strong interaction are of the same charge @xmath511 ( this agrees with the idea of the grand unified field theory in particle physics that these three interactions should finally be with the same charge ) . then according to the yukawa theory we have that the residual force of strong interaction between two particles such as proton and neutron is given by the exchange of the @xmath0 mesons . from the yukawa theory with the electric charge @xmath511 for strong interaction we have that the strength of this residual force of strong interaction is roughly proportional to : @xmath797 where @xmath798 is the mass of the @xmath5 meson and @xmath799 is the mass of the electron ( when @xmath800 we have the case of the electromagnetic interaction and we have @xmath801 which is just the strength of the electromagnetic interaction ) . from this",
    "we see that the residual force of strong interaction is in fact not strong because @xmath802 and that the charge @xmath511 is small .",
    "this however agrees with the fact that the range of this residual force of strong interaction is very short comparing to the long range of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "then why the strong interaction is strong ?",
    "let us give a more detail description of the knot modeling of the strong interaction in the above sections , as follows .    in the above sections we identify the strong interaction of quarks as a closed loop interaction formed by a knot @xmath14 of the gauge field and the quarks interacted by the gauge field are components of @xmath803 acted by the generalized wilson loop @xmath31 .",
    "this form of interaction is different from the electromagnetic interaction in the form of the exchange of photon which is described by the usual feynman diagram .",
    "this strong interaction is for the formation of one elementary particle such as the @xmath3 meson or the proton",
    ". then we need a strong interaction between two elementary particles .",
    "the above residual force is an interaction between two elementary particles but it is not strong .",
    "thus there should have another effect of the strong interaction .",
    "let us model this effect of strong interaction by the linking of two ( or more ) knots where each knot formed by a gauge field gives an elementary particle .",
    "this means that we use links to model the strong interactions among the elementary particles where each elementary particle is in a knot form .",
    "this model of strong interaction is a nonabelian effect because the effect of linking can only be achieved by nonabelian gauge group such as @xmath54 or @xmath92 ( in contrast to mesons modeled by @xmath54 we shall model baryons by @xmath92 ) .",
    "it follows that electron can not feel this strong effect because electron is only interacted by the abelian gauge group @xmath133 .    as a simple example of linking let us consider the hopf link depicted in fig.5 . for the hopf link we can show that the linking gives a @xmath159-matrix which is independent of the @xmath159-matrices of the two knots ( for the two elementary particles ) @xcite .",
    "this @xmath159- matrix which is a new degree of freedom gives the strong interaction between the two elementary particles formed by the two linked knots ( in the above sections we show that for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons the strange degree of freedom is from a @xmath159-matrix denoted by @xmath91 which is from a type of linking with linking number @xmath517 .",
    "this type of linking is suitable to model the strong interaction of the associated production of strange particles @xcite@xcite@xcite-@xcite ) .    for simplicity",
    "let us use diagrams in fig.4 and fig.5 to describe the two types of strong interaction between two elementary particles ( for simplicity in these diagrams we use a circle to mean a nontrivial knot such as the knot @xmath46 ) .",
    "the diagrams of fig.4 is similar to the usual feymann diagram which gives the residual force of strong interaction described by the yukawa theory with @xmath511 as the charge .",
    "the diagram of fig.5 is a hopf link which also gives strong interaction between two elementary particles .",
    "this interaction is strong and of short range which is shorter than the rasidual force because it is a linking effect .",
    "this interaction also gives attractive effect between two elementary particles because it is a linking effect and thus it can replace the existing theory of attractive nuclear force which is supposed given by the exchange of the @xmath804 meson whose existence has not yet been as clearly confirmed as the other mesons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this interaction is also asymptotically free because it is a linking effect that the knots representing the elematary particles are free to move except that they are linked together .",
    "this gives the property of asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction @xcite@xcite .",
    "then when the up or down quarks represented by complex numbers @xmath319 forming a complex vector @xmath32 is attached to a quantum knot @xmath31 to form a meson ( or a baryon ) we have that these up or down quarks are in strong interaction in the knot form ; as described in the above sections . then when the @xmath319 are slowly separated ( but are still attached to @xmath31 at different proper times ( or at different positions of @xmath31 ) we have that the up or down quarks are in weak interaction ; as described in the above sections ( in the following of this section we shall estimate the strength of weak interaction ) .",
    "then since @xmath31 is a knot it is closed and thus the real parts of the interaction propagators of the form @xmath805 in the formation of @xmath31 cancel each other , as shown in the sections on the formation of @xmath31 .",
    "these real parts of the interaction propagators of the form @xmath805 are for the strength of the interaction of the up and down quarks represented by the components of the complex vector @xmath32 attached to @xmath31 .",
    "thus in this case the up or down quarks are basically asymptotically free .",
    "this thus gives the property of asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction when the up or down quarks are in a knot form of strong interaction .",
    "this also shows that the strong and weak interactions are closedly related .",
    "then when the components @xmath319 are further apart ( but are stll attached to @xmath31 ) we have that the mass @xmath798 of the elematary particle is decreased to give energy for this further apart ( this decreasing of mass can be obtained by reducing the winding number @xmath412 of @xmath31 ) . in this case the strength @xmath806 between the quarks represented by the components @xmath319 increases ( while @xmath319 are stll attached to @xmath31 ) .",
    "this thus gives both the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom and the phenomenon of quark confinement of strong interaction .",
    "then we notice that this knot modeling of mesons ( or baryons ) is based on the representation @xmath30 .",
    "thus to separate the components of @xmath32 by strong interaction the quantum knot @xmath31 must be separated .",
    "then the way to separate @xmath31 is that the closed loop @xmath31 becomes several closed loops connected together and these closed loops as quantum knots @xmath807 are then separated to act on quarks to form mesons . since these resulting quantum knots @xmath807 are matrices that they must act on complex vectors @xmath808 whose components represent quarks to form @xmath809 and that as matrices they can not act on a single complex number @xmath126 representing a single quark .",
    "thus the result of strong decay of a meson based on the knot model @xmath30 is a bunch of mesons formed by @xmath809 and there are no free quarks separated from the meson .",
    "this also gives the phenomenon of quark confinement of strong interaction .",

    "further during this weak decay the @xmath6 ( which is similar to the electron ) comes out from the @xmath3 and the mass of @xmath3 is transformed to the mass of @xmath6 .",

    "thus the strength of this weak decay is roughly given by : @xmath816 we see that this is roughly the strength of the fermi coupling constant of weak interaction .",
    "this shows that this model of decay of @xmath3 is possible to describle the weak decay of @xmath3 .",
    "this also shows that we can deduce the strength of weak interaction from the strength of the usual yukawa theory of strong interaction and we have that the strong and weak interactions are closedly related .    now with the fermi coupling constant of weak interaction as similar to the yukawa theory of the exchange of @xmath0 mesons we may describe the weak interaction by the exchange of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 particles of the standard model of weak and electromagnetic interaction @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in fig.6a and fig.6b",

    "this is just the same as for the above weak decay with the gauge particle @xmath817 .",

    "this linking effect gives the strong interaction between two elementary particles and gives the associated production property for strong interactions producing particles with the strange quark @xmath82 such as the interaction @xmath93 .",

    "we show that the asymptotic freedom of strong interaction and the weak interaction are closedly relatd where the separation of the components @xmath319 representing quarks and leptons while these @xmath319 attaching to the quantum knot @xmath31 gives the asymptotic freedom of strong interaction and also gives the weak interaction .",

    "this shows that we can indirectly observe free quarks in the sense that quarks become leptons while we also show that quarks are confined by the strong interaction in the knot form .",
    "thus the strong and the weak interactions are closedly relatd .    we show that the strength of weak interaction is as a product of two strengths of the strong interaction of the yukawa form .",

    "we show that the @xmath0 mesons modeled by the prime knot @xmath46 gives the @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 violations of the weak interaction .",

    "we notice that our knot model of quark confinement is of some similarity to the bag model of quark confinement @xcite-@xcite . in our knot model of mesons ( and baryons ) quarks are confined by knots while in the bag model of strong interaction quarks are confined by bags ."
