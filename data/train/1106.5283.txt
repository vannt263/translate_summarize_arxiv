    "in paper i of this series [ 1 ] , we describe the emergence of a vacuum scalar field at the big bang , using a halpern - huang quantum scalar field [ 2 ] in the flrw ( friedman - lamaitre - robertson - walker ) framework .",
    "the scalar field gives rise to an equivalent cosmological constant that decays according to a power law .",
    "this offers an explanation of dark energy without the usual `` fine - tuning '' problem . in this paper",
    ", we study an extension of the model that might be relevant to inflation .",
    "there is now experimental support for a vacuum scalar field , with the discovery of the higgs boson of the standard model of particle theory [ 3 ] .",
    "extension of the standard model to grand unified theories require additional vacuum scalar fields . here",
    "we consider a generic scalar field @xmath0 , without inquiring into its place in particle theory .",
    "what is important for us is renormalization , a distinctive feature of quantum field theory .",
    "in contrast to a classical field , a quantum field has virtual processes with an unbounded momentum spectrum .",
    "the high tail of this spectrum must be cut off at some value @xmath1 for otherwise calculated physical quantities would diverge . furthermore , the high momentum tail can not accurately describe the physical system being modeled . in a self - contained field theory , this cutoff momentum provides the only scale in theory . in physical applications",
    ", we usually deal with processes with momenta @xmath2 @xmath3 , and it is useful to `` hide '' the degrees of freedom between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , so that @xmath4 becomes an effective cutoff .",
    "this is achieved through `` renormalization '' , a readjustment of interaction parameters . for a scalar field",
    ", renormalization makes the self - interacting potential @xmath5 dependent on @xmath4 .",
    "if we suppose that the universe emerges from nothing at the big bang , we would have to conclude that the scalar potential was zero at the big bang .",
    "when we trace back towards the big bang , we should have @xmath6 when the length scale goes to zero , and @xmath7 .",
    "that is , the potential should be `` asymptotically free '' , and this uniquely determines it as the non - polynomial halpern - huang potential used in i. this potential also exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. , the field potential can have a minimum at @xmath8 .",
    "this enables us to neglect quantum fluctuations about the average field , which is treated classically .",
    "of course , quantum effects are still present through the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath9 .",
    "we use the rw ( robertson - walker ) metric , in which all coordinates co - expand with length scale @xmath10 . the scalar field must share this scale , and",
    "thus @xmath11 this relation sets up a dynamic feedback loop between quantum field and gravity , because the field potential depends on @xmath4 .",
    "as shown in i , this dynamics makes the hubble parameter decay in time according to a power law:@xmath12 this implies @xmath13 , which signifies an accelerated expansion of the universe , indicating `` dark energy '' without the fine - tuning problem .",
    "for example , with @xmath14 ,  we can set @xmath15 initially ( in planck units ) , and it will decay to the present value of @xmath16 in the course of @xmath17 years [ 4 ] .    in paper",
    "i , we had considered two questions related to cosmic inflation :    * what mechanism is responsible for the creation of all the matter in the universe before the cosmic inflation made them fall out of each other s horizon ? * how could the matter energy scale , which is of order 1 gev , be decoupled from the planck scale of 10@xmath18 gev that is built into einstein s equation ?    with the real scalar field used in i , we were not able to find satisfactory answers . in this paper , we extend the model to a complex scalar field , and exploit new physics arising from the phase dynamics of the scalar field : superfluidity , quantized vorticity , and quantum turbulence .",
    "a complex scalar field is an order parameter for superfluidity , whatever its microscopic origin .",
    "the point is that the gradient of its phase gives rise to a superfluid velocity field , as is familiar from superconductivity [ 5 ] , and superfluidity in liquid helium [ 6,7 ] and cold trapped atomic gases [ 8 ] . with a complex scalar field permeating all space",
    ", the whole universe becomes a superfluid .",
    "to describe the cosmic superfluidity in a mathematically tractable way , it is important to stay within the flrw framework , for otherwise we will have to devise a new metric  a formidable task , considering the fact that , in nearly a century of general relativity , we only know about a handful of metrics .",
    "but we face an immediate problem , namely , flrw assumes spatial uniformity , but a completely uniform complex scalar field is not qualitatively different from a real field , which we have already found to be inadequate .",
    "the solution is to consider a complex scalar field with uniform modulus but variable phase , which should still be uniform in some sense .",
    "this leads us to consider a uniform superfluid with a uniform distribution of quantized vortices .",
    "a quantized vortex refers to a velocity field flowing about a axis , the vortex line , with quantized circulation .",
    "the vortex line forms a closed curve in space , and the superfluid density goes to zero at the line . to stay in the flrw framework ,",
    "we encase the vortex line in a tube of finite radius , and take the superfluid density to be zero inside this tube , and uniform outside .",
    "our scalar field is now real and uniform , but it exists in a multiply - connected space that is laced with `` worm holes'' vortex tubes of fluctuating sizes and shapes . from a coarse - grained point of view , we describe the latter in terms of a vortex - line  density ( length per unit volume ) , and take the density to be uniform in space .",
    "the uniform vortex density corresponds to what feynman [ 9 ] calls a `` vortex tangle '' , or quantum turbulence .",
    "its time development can be describe by vinen s equation [ 10 ] , which was proposed for liquid helium on a phenomenological basis , and subsequently derived by schwarz [ 11,12 ] from superfluid hydrodynamics .",
    "we adopt this equation as part of our cosmological equations , thus picturing the early universe as dominated by quantum turbulence in the cosmic superfluid .",
    "this is the new physics that provides answers to the questions we raised on inflation .    to maintain a vortex tangle",
    ", there must be a supply of large vortex rings generated continually by heat currents in the superfluid .",
    "these large rings will degrade into ever smaller rings through reconnection of vortex lines , until they reach microscopic size and disappear into background fluctuations .",
    "when the supply of large rings become inadequate , the vortex tangle will decay .",
    "the signature of a reconnection event is the creation of two oppositely directed jets of energy , which provides an efficient mechanism for matter creation . in this process ,",
    "two originally smooth vortex lines cross , reconnect and separate , leaving cusps in the separating lines .  because of the cusps , the separating lines spring away from each other , theoretically with infinite speed ( see appendix b ) , creating energy jets that could materialize via the coupling between the superfluid and matter . by dimensional analysis",
    ", reconnections should occur at the rate of about one per planck volume ( @xmath19 @xmath20 ) per planck time ( 10@xmath21s ) , with each reconnection releasing the order of one unit of planck energy ( 10@xmath18 gev ) .",
    "even though the vortex tangle may have a very short lifetime , an amount of energy of the order of the present total energy of the universe can be released , when we factor in the total expanding volume of the universe .",
    "this conceptually answers our quest for an efficient way to create matter .",
    "it is interesting to note that solar flares on the sun s surface convert a large amount of potential energy to kinetic energy in a very short time , and this is achieved through the reconnection of magnetic flux lines , and the energy is released in the form of jets .    on the basis of the physical ideas described above",
    ", we put together a closed set of phenomenological cosmological equations , in which the independent degree of freedom are the gravitational field , the modulus of the scalar field , the vortex - line density , and matter described as a classical perfect fluid .",
    "this generalizes the model discussed in i.    the vortex - matter interaction brings into our equations a new scale , the qcd scale of 1 gev , as compared to the planck scale of 10@xmath18 gev in einstein s equation .",
    "this two scales decouple from each other , due to the structure of vinen s equation .",
    "the set of cosmological equations can be split into two subsets , one governing the gravitational and scalar fields , the other describing the vortex - matter system , with a link whose time rate of change depends on the ratio ( matter scale)/(planck scale ) @xmath22 .",
    "decoupling occurs dues to the extreme smallness of this number .",
    "this explains , from the viewpoint of einstein s equation , why one can do calculations on stellar structure  without having to worry about cosmic expansion , and vice versa .",
    "the cosmological equations with appropriate initial conditions lead to a rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "a vortex tangle initially grows , and eventually decays , but not before it creates all the matter in the universe . in our picture , the inflation era is the era of quantum turbulence .",
    "we can choose phenomenological parameters such that the lifetime of the vortex tangle is of order 10@xmath23s , during which time the radius of the universe increases by a factor of order 10@xmath24 , and the total amount of matter created was equal to what we have now , of the order of @xmath25 suns .    with the demise of the vortex tangle , the inflation era ends , and our model ceases to be valid , because the universe would have grown to be so large that density variations become important .",
    "however , with the decoupling of scales , the model prepares the stage for the standard `` hot big bang theory '' [ 13 ] , with the added feature that the universe remains a superfluid .",
    "all astrophysical activities therefore take place in the cosmic superfluid , with observable consequences . among these are dark matter , the galactic voids , the so - called `` non - thermal filaments '' , and cosmic jets .",
    "these will be discussed later in this paper .    in summary ,",
    "this model offers explanations of diverse cosmic phenomena from a unified picture , namely a cosmic superfluid arising from a vacuum complex scalar field , with a full range of vortex activities .",
    "a complex scalar field @xmath26 is equivalent to a two - component real field @xmath27 , with the relation@xmath28 where we introduce the phase representation , with modulus @xmath29 and phase @xmath30the classical lagrangian density is given by@xmath31 in the quantum field theory , in order to tame high - frequency virtual processes , the operator @xmath32 in the kinetic term is `` regulated '' by the introduction of a small - distance cutoff , or equivalently a high - momentum cutoff @xmath4 . as in i , we set @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the scale of the rw metric .",

    "we omit this factor .",
    "the presence of a vacuum complex scalar field makes the universe a superfluid , a salient feature of which is the quantization of vorticity . around any closed circuit @xmath45 ,",
    "the phase @xmath46 can only change by a multiple of @xmath47 since @xmath26 must be continuous .",
    "this lead to the quantization condition @xmath48 where the line integral is carried around any closed curve @xmath45 in space , and @xmath49 is an integer . if @xmath50 , then @xmath45 can not be shrunken to zero ; it encircles a directed line called the vortex line , on which @xmath51",
    ". the vortex line can not terminate inside the superfluid ; it either forms a closed loop , or terminate on a surface .",
    "we only need consider @xmath52 , for higher vortices tend to be unstable and break up into lower ones , when perturbations are present .",
    "the velocity tends to infinity at the vortex line , and the modulus @xmath29 must vanish on the line to keep the energy finite .",
    "thus , the vortex line renders the space non - simply connected , and we can have @xmath53 , even though @xmath54 is a gradient .",
    "we write@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vorticity density .",
    "this is analogous to maxwell s equation for a magnetic field due to a current in a wire shaped like  the vortex line .",
    "the solution is the biot - savart law@xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vector position of a point on the vortex line , and the integration ranges over @xmath59 , the totality of all vortex lines .",
    "the integral above diverges when @xmath60 , and a cutoff is needed . in liquid helium",
    "the cutoff comes from atomicity , and in our case it comes from the field - theory cutoff @xmath61 .",
    "this replaces the vortex line by a tube called the vortex core , whose radius should be proportional to @xmath62 , since that is the only length scale available .",
    "we shall continue to refer to the center of the core as the vortex line .",
    "the field modulus @xmath29 inside the vortex core is suppressed , with functional form determined by the cutoff function .",
    "we adopt the simple model that @xmath29 is zero inside , and constant outside . in this picture",
    ", the scalar field can be regarded as uniform in space , except that the space is made non simply - connected , by exclusion of the vortex tube .",
    "a static vortex solution is discussed in appendix a , and vortex dynamics is reviewed in appendix b.    the vortex tube can not spontaneously arise , but must be nucleated by quantum fluctuations of the scalar field .",
    "a microscopic ring - shape tube would appear by fluctuation , and grow to macroscopic dimensions under appropriate conditions .",
    "the vortex tube has an energy cost of @xmath63 per unit length , and its presence induces superfluid flow .",
    "thus , its energy consists of of two parts:@xmath64    we work within the rw metric , which assumes spatial uniformity . to conform to this requirement in the equations of motion ( [ field0 ] ) , we assume that @xmath29 is constant in space outside of the vortex tube , and we perform spatial averages on terms involving the phase @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 denotes spatial average .",
    "the space , however , is the non - simply connected region outside of vortex tubes .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the scalar field are given by@xmath68 where the @xmath69 term is explained in i. the second equation in ( [ field1 ] ) gives @xmath70which will rapidly vanish as @xmath10 increases .",
    "we assume @xmath71 , and neglect it .",
    "thus we have@xmath72 with@xmath73    the vortex tubes created in the early universe must have a core radius proportional to @xmath62 of the rw metric , since that is only length scale available . this core will expand with the universe , maintaining the same fraction of the radius of the universe , and may account for the presently observed voids in the galactic distribution , as we shall discuss later .",
    "the formation of quantum turbulence in the form of a vortex tangle is discussed in appendix b. in this model , which is restricted to spatial uniformity through use of the rw metric , we describe the tangle with one variable @xmath74 , the vortex line density ( average length per unit volume ) .",
    "this quantity obeys vinen s phenomenological equation , which in flat space - time has the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are phenomenological parameters .",
    "the generalization to curved space - time is @xmath78 which in rw metric reduces to@xmath79 the energy density of the vortex tangle is@xmath80 vinen s equation thus states@xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are model parameters that may depend on the time .",
    "as explained in appendix b , two vortex lines undergo reconnection when they approach each other to within a distance @xmath84 @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is their relative speed , which is of the same order as the average speed in the superfluid .",
    "thus , in steady - state , the average spacing between vortex lines should be @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , by geometrical considerations , the average spacing should be of order @xmath88 this gives the estimate@xmath89 where @xmath90 is a constant .",
    "the parameters @xmath91 may depend on @xmath62 , for they could depend on the radius of the vortex core .",
    "let us review the framework for the cosmological equations , i.e. , einstein s equation with rw metric .",
    "the cosmic expansion is described by @xmath34 , the scale of the rw metric , and we introduce the hubble parameter @xmath66 .",

    "the third equation is the conservation law @xmath98 , and it guarantees @xmath99",
    ". the inclusion of ( [ scalar1 ] ) and ( [ vinen ] ) will complete the dynamics and close the equations .",
    "so far we have three independent variables : the scale of the universe @xmath10 , the modulus of the vacuum scalar field @xmath29 , and the energy density of the vortex tangle @xmath100 .",
    "we now introduce matter , modeled as a classical perfect fluid of energy density @xmath101 .",
    "its pressure is taken to be @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the equation - of - state parameter , with possible values @xmath104 corresponding respectively to `` vacuum energy '' , `` pressureless dust '' , and `` radiation '' . the total energy density @xmath94 and total pressure @xmath95 are now given by @xmath105 the cosmological equations",
    "are then given by@xmath106 with constraint and conservation equations @xmath107    the equation @xmath99 acts as the equation of motion for matter .",
    "to emphasize this , we can rewrite the cosmological equations in the following form : @xmath108 where the last equation is a rewrite of @xmath109 the parameters @xmath110 are defined in ( [ vinen ] ) , and may depend on the time .",
    "the constraint on initial conditions@xmath111 is now preserved by the equations of motion .",

    "the qcd scale is unrelated to the quark mass from the higgs field , but spontaneously arises in the scale - invariant qcd , through formation of the nucleon bound state , in a phenomenon known as `` dimensional transmutation '' .",
    "the simplest mathematical example of this mechanism is the occurrence of a bound state in an attractive @xmath121-function potential in the 2d schrdinger equation [ 15 ] .",

    "the equations of motion in the phase representation @xmath158are@xmath159 consider an infinite vortex line along the @xmath160-axis with  unit quantized vorticity , such that@xmath161 where @xmath45 is a circle about the origin in the @xmath162 plane .",
    "this gives @xmath163 , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath164 .",
    "thus @xmath165 , @xmath166 and the equation for @xmath29 becomes@xmath167 putting@xmath168 we have@xmath169 where for the hh potential @xmath157 we have@xmath170 where @xmath171 is the kummer function .",
    "the boundary conditions are@xmath172 we take @xmath173 , and find the numerical solution by `` shooting '' , i.e. , adjusting the initial conditions so as to get a nonzero @xmath174 . we obtain the desired behavior with @xmath175 ,",
    "@xmath176 the field modulus @xmath177 is plotted in fig.4 . the high - energy cutoff @xmath4 suppresses the field at small distances@xmath178 with the functional form of the field dependent on the cutoff function .",
    "we simply set@xmath179{cc}% f\\left (   \\infty\\right )   & \\left (   r > r_{0}\\right ) \\\\ 0 & \\left (   r\\,<r_{0}\\right ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath180 is the core radius . with this approximation ,",
    "the scalar field is uniform in a multiply - connected space .",
    "a simple vortex structure is the vortex ring , whose vortex line is a directed circle of radius @xmath181 , as illustrated in fig.5 . the ring moves normal to its own plane , in a direction in accordance with the right - hand rule , with velocity [ 25]@xmath182 where @xmath183 is proportional to the core radius .",
    "the logarithmic factor @xmath184 is slowing - varying , and may be regarded as a constant for all practical purposes .  thus @xmath185 @xmath186 approximately .",
    "we can qualitatively understand the motion of an arbitrary vortex line as follows . at any point on the vortex line",
    "there is a radius of curvature @xmath181 , which we can associate with an imaginary vortex ring of the same radius , tangent to the line at that point .",
    "the local translational velocity would be @xmath185 @xmath186 normal to this ring .",
    "the more sharply a vortex line bends , the faster it moves perpendicular to the bending . in this manner",
    ", a vortex line generally executes complicated self - induced motion , as illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "the local velocity @xmath187 of the vortex line , where @xmath188 is a parameter along the vortex line , is also the velocity of the superfluid at that point .",
    "the reconnection of vortex lines proposed by feynman [ 6 ] is illustrated in fig.6 .",
    "it has been simulated via the nonlinear schrdinger equation [ 27 ] .",
    "this mechanism is important for the formation of the vortex tangle , in the following scenario according to schwarz [ 11,12 ] .",
    "vortex rings will grow when there is a normal fluid head wind , i.e. , counter heat flow opposed to the ring s translational motion , and shrink in a tail wind .",
    "given a distribution of vortex rings , some will grow to large sizes , and inevitably reconnect , as schematically illustrated in fig.7 .",
    "the reconnection produces a set of smaller rings , some of which will again grow and reconnect , and so forth , until there is vortex tangle , like the one shown in fig.7 through computer simulation , with a fractal dimension 1.6 [ 28 ] .",
    "the steady - state of a vortex tangle is maintained by a constant rate of growth and reconnections .",
    "if the heat source is removed , the vortex tangle will decay into a sparse collection of contracting vortex rings , and eventually disappear into the sea of quantum fluctuations [ 29 ] .",
    "reconnection occurs between two antiparallel vortex lines .",
    "computer simulation shows that parallel vortex lines tend to reorient themselves at close approach in order to reconnect . the critical distance for reconnection between two vortex lines with the same radius of curvature @xmath181",
    "is given by [ 12 ] @xmath189 where @xmath190 is a constant . here",
    ", the logarithmic factor is practically a constant .",
    "comparison with ( [ ring ] ) shows @xmath191 , where @xmath86 is the relative velocity of the vortex segments .    as illustrated in fig.7 , reconnection creates two cusps on the newly constituted vortex lines , with very small radii of curvature .",
    "consequently , the cusps will spring away from each other at very high speed , creating two oppositely directed jets of energy , which are signature events of vortex reconnection .    in vinen",
    "s equation @xmath192 , the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 should embody all the effects discuss above . in liquid helium , @xmath76 is proportional to the speed of the normal fluid .",
    "this equation has also been derived from vortex dynamics , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be expressed in terms of properties of the system of vortex lines [ 12 ] .",
    "however , they do not always agree with the phenomenological view .    in superfluid helium",
    ", experiments reveal that the velocity distribution in the tangle deviates from that in classical turbulence , in that it has a fat non - gaussian tail [ 24 ] .",
    "reconnection events have been observed and studied statistically [ 30 ] ."
