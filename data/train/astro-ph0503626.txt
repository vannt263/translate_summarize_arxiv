    "cepheid variables are arguably the most important stellar standard candles to calibrate the range of a few kiloparsecs out to some 30 megaparsecs on the extragalactic distance ladder . the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) has used cepheid photometry in optical v and i bands in some 25 nearby resolved spiral and irregular galaxies to improve on the value of the hubble constant .",
    "there are reasons to believe that cepheids are even better standard candles when they are used in the near - infrared regime .",
    "yet , only few galaxies have to date cepheid observations in the near - infrared , and usually few variables have been observed in these galaxies which have not been sufficient to significantly improve on the distance determinations which have been made in optical bands .",
    "a recent example is the work of the hst key project team which used the nicmos camera onboard hst to obtain follow - up observations of a number of cepheids in several of the key project galaxies which had previously been surveyed for cepheids in vi passbands ( macri et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in previous papers , we have reported on the discovery of more than a hundred cepheid variables in the sculptor group spiral ngc 300 ( pietrzyski et al . 2002 ) from an optical wide - field imaging survey , and we have derived the distance to this galaxy from the vi light curves of a long - period subsample of these cepheids ( gieren et al .",
    "this latter work resulted in a more accurate determination of the distance of ngc 300 than the previous studies of freedman et al .",
    "( 1992 , 2001 ) which only used the limited number of cepheids with sparsely sampled light curves known at the time .",
    "ngc 300 , at a distance of about 2 mpc , is a key galaxy in our ongoing _",
    "araucaria project _ in which we seek to improve the calibration of the environmental dependences of several stellar distance indicators ( e.g. gieren et al .",
    "2001 ) to the point that the distances to nearby , resolved galaxies can be measured to 5 percent or better .",
    "apart from cepheid variables , our group has also been studying the usefulness of blue supergiants as a spectroscopic distance indicator in this galaxy , with very encouraging preliminary results ( bresolin et al .",
    "2002 ; kudritzki et al .",
    "recent deep hst / acs imaging in several fields in ngc 300 obtained by us in bvi filters will further allow us to obtain an improved estimate of the distance of ngc 300 from the tip of the red giant branch magnitude .",
    "it is by comparing the distances of a galaxy coming from such independent methods , and doing this for a sample of galaxies with widely different environmental properties that we hope to filter out and calibrate one or several techniques of distance measurement able to yield the desired high accuracy .",
    "while the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation in optical bandpasses is already a powerful tool for distance determination , especially when the problem of the appropriate reddening corrections is minimized by the application of wesenheit magnitudes ( e.g. fouqu et al .",
    "2003 ; storm et al .",
    "2004 ) ) , one can expect that the use of cepheids in the near - infrared ( nir ) will lead to the most accurate distance work with these variables .",
    "this is for three well - known reasons : first , absorption corrections in the nir are small in comparison to their sizes in optical passbands , which is important because cepheids as young stars are usually found in dusty regions in their host galaxies ; second , the intrinsic dispersion of the pl relation due to the finite width of the cepheid instability strip decreases with increasing wavelength , and is in k only about half of the intrinsic dispersion of the pl relation in the v band ; and third and very importantly , even random - phase cepheid magnitudes in a nir band can already produce a distance determination which can compete in accuracy with the one coming from optical cepheid photometry using full , well - sampled light curves .",
    "this latter fact is a consequence of the decreasing amplitudes of cepheid light curves towards the infrared .",
    "since cepheid light curves also become increasingly more symmetric and stable in their shapes from the optical towards the k band , it is possible to determine accurate corrections to single - phase nir observations to derive the mean magnitude of a cepheid in a nir band with very good accuracy .",
    "this has been demonstrated , for instance , by nikolaev et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and more recently by our group ( soszyski et al .",
    "2005 ) using a different approach .    since in the araucaria project",
    "our interest is to boost the accuracy of the stellar standard candles we are investigating to their highest possible levels , our prime interest with cepheid variables is to use them in the near - infrared , and to calibrate the effect environmental parameters , most importantly metallicity , might have on the cepheid nir pl relations .",
    "our strategy is therefore to find a substantial number of cepheids in each target galaxy from wide - field optical surveys ( where they are most easily discovered ) , and obtain follow - up nir photometry at one or two epochs for a selected subsample of cepheids which covers a broad range in periods to allow the construction of accurate nir pl relations .",
    "these can then be compared to the corresponding nir pl relations in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) which are now very well established in jhk bands by the recent work of persson et al .",
    "ngc 300 is the first galaxy of our project for which we report such nir cepheid photometry ; this work will be followed by similar studies for the other local group and sculptor group target galaxies in our project .",
    "the observations , and the reduction and calibration of the data will be described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we will derive the pl relations in the j and k bands from our data and use them , together with the information from the optical v and i bands , to estimate an improved reddening for ngc 300 , and to determine an improved distance to the galaxy . in section 4 we discuss our results , and in section 5 we will summarize the results of this study and draw some conclusions .",
    "we have obtained nir images in j and ks filters for 3 fields in ngc 300 with the vlt and the isaac nir camera / spectrometer of the european southern observatory on cerro paranal .",
    "the coordinates of the field centers are given in table 1 , and the location of the selected fields in the galaxy is shown in fig .",
    "the data were obtained in service mode on six nights in the period july 28-september 05 , 2003 .",
    "each 2.5 x 2.5 arcmin field was observed in jks on 2 _ different _ nights to cover two different pulsation phases for the cepheids in the fields , with the aim to improve the determination of their mean magnitudes .",
    "the pixel scale in our chosen setup was 0.148 arcsec / pix .",
    "all images were obtained under sub - arcsec seeing conditions , and for most images the seeing ranged from 0.3 - 0.5 arcsec , a crucial advantage for the photometry in the crowded fields observed .",
    "weather conditions were photometric for at least one of the two observations of a given field .",
    "jhk standard stars on the ukirt system from the list of hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were observed on the photometric nights together with the target fields in ngc 300 to allow an accurate photometric calibration of the data .",
    "we observed our target fields in a dithering mode , limiting each individual integration in j and ks to 30 s and 15 s , respectively .",
    "the total exposure time for a given target field on a given night was 11.5 min in j and 54 min in k , long enough to reach even the fainter cepheids in our fields previously discovered in our optical survey with a s / n high enough to allow photometry with reasonably small random errors ( @xmath3 0.08 mag ) . in order to achieve an accurate sky subtraction for our frames ,",
    "we regularly observed random comparison fields located slightly outside the galaxy where the stellar density was very low , compared to our target fields , using the autojitteroffset template .",
    "our fields were chosen as to contain 16 cepheid variables from the catalog of pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , 14 of them with periods longer than 10 days ; the longest - period cepheid in our sample has a period of 83 days .",
    "the use of such long - period cepheids makes our distance result independent of problems due to the possible contamination of the sample with overtone pulsators ( see section 4 ) .",
    "sky subtraction and flatfielding of the frames was performed with the eclipse package .",
    "the psf model was obtained in an iterative way as described by pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2002 ) . the final aperture correction for a given frame",
    "was adopted as a median from aperture corrections obtained for 10 - 20 carefully selected stars .",
    "the typical rms scatter for the aperture corrections derived in this manner was about 0.02 mag .    in order to calibrate the photometry onto the standard system , aperture photometry for the standard stars",
    "was performed by choosing an aperture of 14 pixels .",
    "having relatively few standard star observations on a given photometric night , typically 5 , we adopted mean extinction coefficients for paranal as published on the eso webpage , and the color coefficients established by pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2002 ) .",
    "this way we derived zero points in the j and k bands from each standard .",
    "the final zero point in a band was adopted as the mean of the zero points obtained from all standards . > from the residuals of the standard star observations , the zero point uncertainty of the photometry is estimated to be @xmath40.04 mag .",
    "in table 2 , we present the journal of calibrated j and k magnitudes of the 16 cepheids we observed . for all cepheids except cep017 , cep032 and cep116 two observations at different phases of their pulsation cycles were obtained .",
    "the v - band phases of the observations were calculated with the ephemeris given in gieren et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and are given in table 2 .",
    "in the last two columns of table 2 , we show the intensity mean magnitudes of the cepheids which we derived by applying a correction to the observed single - phase magnitudes .",
    "the corrections to mean magnitudes were calculated using the actual v - band phases , and the v and i light curve amplitudes of the cepheids from our previous optical work together with template light curves in j and k. a detailed description of the procedure we use to correct the single - phase j- and k - band observations of cepheid variables to obtain the corresponding mean magnitudes has been presented in soszyski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and the reader is referred to that paper for details . in short , our correction procedure makes use of the known amplitudes of a cepheid in v and i to predict the correction to its mean near - infrared magnitude from an observation obtained at a known v - band phase .",
    "since for all of our present cepheids accurate periods and optical light curves have been established from our previous work , we were able to apply this model to each of the cepheids in our sample .",
    "soszyski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have demonstrated that our adopted procedure reproduces the mean j and k magnitudes from single - phase j and k observations of a cepheid with a typical accuracy of 0.02 - 0.03 mag if the light curves of this cepheid are accurately determined in v and i bands , and its period is well established .",
    "this accuracy is superior to that obtained from the approach of nikolaev et al .",
    "it is seen from the data in table 2 that the mean magnitudes in j and k derived from the two observations at different phases do indeed agree very well for most of the cepheids , with differences between the two independent determinations of the mean j and k magnitudes for each star which are just a few hundredths of a mag , which is in the order of the uncertainties of the single j and k measurements . for a very few cepheids in the sample , the agreement between the two independent determinations of the mean magnitude is slightly worse ; this is likely due to a larger uncertainty on their periods , and a minor quality of their v and i light curves , or to the fact that for some cepheids we have light curves only in v , but not in i ( see pietrzynski et al .",
    "2002 ; gieren et al . 2004 ) .    in table 3",
    ", we show the final , adopted intensity mean j and k magnitudes for our ngc 300 cepheid sample , obtained from a weighted mean of the two individual determinations for each star .",
    "also given are the respective mean errors of these values which are about 0.03 mag for the brightest cepheids in the sample and increase slightly toward the fainter , shorter - period variables .",
    "the periods of the cepheids were taken from our previous optical studies . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the j- and k - band pl relations based on the data in table 3 . in this figure",
    ", we have retained the two individual determinations of the mean j and k measurements for each cepheid ( except the 3 stars having observations at only one epoch ) , in order to demonstrate the very good agreement between the individual determinations of the mean magnitudes , which again shows the high efficiency of our correction procedure mentioned before . in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the adopted , final mean magnitudes of the cepheids against log p. these are the final j- and k - band cepheid pl relations determined from our current data for ngc 300 . in our distance determination from these data , we omit the two shortest - period cepheids in the sample which have periods less than 10 days .",
    "the faintest cepheid , cep116 , has by far the largest uncertainty on its j and k measurements and is excluded for this reason .",
    "it could also be an overtone pulsator , given its short period of 5.98 days .",
    "the star cep104 ( p=7.73 days ) is strongly overluminous in the k band , but not so in the j band .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior is the presence of a bright , unresolved red companion star .",
    "given the very strong ( about 1 mag ) deviation of this star from the mean k - band pl relation , far beyond the observed scatter of this relation , we prefer to exclude it from our analysis .",
    "we retain for the distance determination all other 14 stars which span a period range from 13.5 to 83.0 days , yielding an excellent period baseline for the pl fits .",
    "weighted least - squares fits to the mean j and k data of these 14 cepheids yield slopes of the pl relations of @xmath5 in j and @xmath6 in k , with 1  @xmath7 uncertainties of 0.047 and 0.044 , respectively .",
    "these values have to be compared with the slopes of the pl relations in j and k determined by persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for lmc cepheids , which are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . while in the k band the agreement of the slope of",
    "the pl relation defined by the cepheids in ngc 300 and in the lmc is excellent , the agreement in the j band is less good , but there is still marginal consistency . in order to derive the distance of ngc 300 relative to the lmc , we therefore performed weighted least - squares fits to the data points forcing the slopes to the corresponding lmc values from persson et al .",
    "this yields the following results : @xmath10 @xmath11    according to hawarden et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the j and k magnitudes on the nicmos system , on which the persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) data were obtained , are fainter than the ukirt magnitudes by a color - independent and constant 0.034 @xmath0 0.004 mag in j , and by 0.015 @xmath0 0.007 mag in k. on the nicmos system , our pl zero points are therefore 24.288 in j , and 23.932 in k. using the zero points of the lmc pl relations as determined by persson et al .",
    "( 16.336 in j , and 16.036 in k ) , we then obtain a difference of the distance moduli between ngc 300 and the lmc of 7.952 in the j band , and 7.896 in the k band .",
    "assuming an lmc distance of 18.50 mag , we find the distance modulus of ngc 300 to be 26.452 in j , and 26.396 in k. to correct these values for interstellar absorption , we adopted the reddening law of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which yields @xmath12=0.902 e(b - v ) , and @xmath13=0.367 e(b - v ) . while the foreground galactic reddening toward ngc 300 is only 0.025 mag ( burstein and heiles 1984 ) ,",
    "there is clearly some additional dust absorption produced inside ngc 300 , visible on hst images of the galaxy . in our previous determination of the distance",
    "to ngc 300 from optical vi data , we had found evidence for an additional reddening of 0.05 mag ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 ) by comparing the distance moduli derived for the galaxy in v , i and the reddening - independent wesenheit ( w ) band . with",
    "the distance moduli determined in the near - infrared j and k bands in this study , we can improve on this value , by fitting the relationship @xmath14 with the known values of the ratios @xmath15 of total to selective absorption in vijk bands ( 3.24 , 1.96 , 0.902 and 0.367 from schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , and with the reddened distance moduli @xmath16 we have determined in vijk ( 26.670 and 26.577 in v , i ( gieren et al . 2004 ) , and 26.452 and 26.396 in j and k , this paper ) .",
    "the best - fitting relation yields @xmath17 @xmath18 from the slope and intersect of the least - squares fit , which is shown in fig .",
    "4 . extending the wavelength coverage of our photometry to the near - infrared",
    ", we therefore find a total reddening to ngc 300 which is slightly larger than the value of 0.075 we had found from the optical study alone . our best value for the reddening - corrected distance to ngc 300 from all bands is 26.367 mag , corresponding to 1.88 mpc .",
    "its uncertainty will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the values in table 4 show that the reddening - corrected distance moduli of ngc 300 in the vijk passbands , calculated with e(b - v)=0.096 as derived above , do all agree extremely well with our adopted true distance modulus of 26.367 mag .",
    "it is worth to note that the very small dispersion of the points in fig .",
    "4 seem to indicate that the reddening laws in ngc 300 and in the galaxy must be very similar .",
    "in this section , we discuss how different sources of random and systematic error may affect our distance result for ngc 300 .",
    "we will not discuss the probably largest single systematic uncertainty , the distance to the lmc , which is discussed in a number of recent papers , including feast ( 2003 ) , walker ( 2003 ) , and benedict et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in agreement with our previous work",
    ", we have adopted @xmath1 ( lmc)=18.50 .",
    "should future work prove that a different value is more appropriate , our distance result can be easily adapted to this new value .",
    "an obvious source of random uncertainty is the photometric noise on our magnitude measurements .",
    "the relatively low scatter of the data points about the mean pl relation in both j and k seen in fig .",
    "3 , which is comparable to the scatter of the individual magnitudes of lmc cepheids around the mean relations ( see persson et al . 2004 ; their figure 3 ) , demonstrates that the random errors on our magnitude measurements are small enough to not significantly increase the observed dispersions of the pl relations in ngc 300 . from the data and their random errors given in tables 1 and 2 , including the calculation of the mean magnitudes of the cepheids from data obtained at only 2 epochs , we estimate that the effect of the random photometric errors on the derived distance modulus does not exceed @xmath0 0.03 mag .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of our photometric zero points in both passbands is estimated to be @xmath0 0.04 mag , as discussed in section 3 of this paper .",
    "one issue of concern is the distribution of the cepheids in our selected sample over the pulsational instability strip . in principle , and particularly with a small number of cepheids it could happen that all stars tend to lie close to the blue or red edge of the instability strip , rather than having positions randomly distributed across the strip .",
    "this could introduce an effect on the zero point of the derived pl relation , even if the true slope remains unaffected , which would translate directly into a corresponding systematic error on the distance modulus derived from these data . from this point of view , a larger number of cepheids in our sample would have been desirable to reduce the effect of this possibly non - homogeneous filling of the instability strip .    in fig . 5 , we have plotted the distribution of the cepheids in ngc 300 over the instability strip in the v , b - v color - magnitude diagram . the full width of the instability strip on this diagram is about 0.5 mag , and it is clearly appreciated that the cepheids selected for the near - infrared followup in this paper are distributed more or less randomly over the strip , with no systematic concentration towards the blue , or the red edge . we therefore conclude that a non - homogeneous filling of the instability strip is not an important source of error in our present study , and estimate that the contribution to the total random error of our derived distance modulus from non - homogeneous filling of the instability strip for our selected cepheid sample does not exceed @xmath00.03 mag .",
    "regarding the selection of our final cepheid sample for the distance solution , we already stated why the two shortest - period cepheids were omitted from the analysis .",
    "keeping only stars with periods longer than 10 days secures a sample with reasonably small random photometric errors , and at the same time assures that there are no overtone pulsators in the sample which would tend to make our zero points systematically too bright ( and hence the distance of the galaxy too small ) . in order to investigate the sensitivity of our derived distance modulus on the chosen cutoff period",
    ", we repeated the fits retaining only the 10 cepheids with periods longer than 20 days .",
    "the effect of this change of the cutoff period on the zero points of the pl fits is less than 0.02 mag in both bands , confirming that the choice of the cutoff period is not a cause of concern in our analysis . in other words , it means that our distance result is not affected in any significant way by a lutz - kelker bias .",
    "as we have shown , our data define slopes of the pl relation in j and k which are consistent with the very accurate slopes derived by persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a sample of nearly 100 lmc cepheids with periods ranging from 3 to 100 days .",
    "the period range of the ngc 300 cepheids selected for our present study is bracketted by the lmc cepheids which provide the fiducial pl relations , so there is no reason of a concern referring to a systematic difference of the mean periods of the program cepheid sample , and of the cepheid sample from which the fiducial relations in j and k were obtained . as a matter of fact , the only truly accurate cepheid pl relations in j and k bands available at the present time , in any galaxy , are those measured in the lmc by persson et al .",
    "we note , however , that the galactic near - infrared pl relations established from the near - infrared surface brightness technique as recently revised by gieren et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do agree very well with the lmc relations of persson et al .",
    ", and have similarly small dispersions .",
    "the 2mass data , while existing for a larger sample of lmc cepheids , are clearly less accurate because they are based on shallow single - phase observations while the persson et al .",
    "data are based on full j and k light curves constructed from data of smaller photometric noise than those of the 2mass survey . the use of the persson et al .",
    "pl relations to derive the relative distance of ngc 300 with respect to the lmc is therefore the most reasonable approach , at the present time .",
    "the effect of metal abundances on the slopes and zero points of cepheid pl relations in optical and near - infrared photometric passbands is currently a debated issue . in particular ,",
    "very little _",
    "empirical _ work has so far been carried out in the near - infrared . in optical bands",
    ", evidence has been mounting that the _ slope _ of the pl relation is independent of metallicity , particularly with the recent result of gieren et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that the galactic cepheid pl relation derived from the infrared surface brightness technique seems to have a slope consistent with the lmc and smc pl relations determined by the ogle - ii project ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ; udalski 2000 ) .",
    "the effect of metallicity on the zero points of optical pl relations seems to be less well constrained , at the present time , although recent progress has been made by the work of storm et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and sakai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in near - infrared bands ,",
    "the only accurate pl relations existing to date are those measured by persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the lmc .",
    "fortunately , the work on the metal abundances of blue supergiant stars in ngc 300 by bresolin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and more recently by urbaneja et al .",
    "( 2005 ) has shown that the average metallicity of young stars in ngc 300 is @xmath2 -0.3 dex , which is very close to the average metallicity of cepheid variables in the lmc , -0.34 @xmath0 0.15 dex ( luck et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable to assume that by using the lmc pl relations as the fiducial relations , our distance modulus result for ngc 300 should be practically independent of metallicity effects , even if future work should prove that there _ is _ a measurable effect of metallicity on the slope and/or zero point of the cepheid pl relations in j and k. we remark that the determination of the size of such metallicity effects on infrared cepheid pl relations is one of the goals of the araucaria project which we will address once we will have measured the j- and k - band cepheid pl relations for more target galaxies of different metallicities .",
    "we believe that with our approach to use the reddened distance moduli obtained in v , i , j and k together with the reddening law of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to constrain the total reddening towards ngc300 , including the intrinsic contribution to the reddening , we have obtained a very accurate result for the total reddening which has improved our previous estimate ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 ) which was based on optical photometry alone .",
    "this claim is supported by the excellent agreement of the values for the absorption - corrected distance moduli which we obtain for each of the bands ( see table 4 ) .",
    "slight possible changes in the adopted reddening law would not change our results , and their agreement among the different bands , in any significant way .",
    "if we adopted as the true distance modulus of ngc 300 only the result coming from the two infrared bands , the change would be less than 0.01 mag , and therefore not significant .",
    "we believe that with our accurate measurement of cepheid mean magnitudes in both optical and near - infrared bands we are controlling the effect of reddening on our distance result to a point that any remaining effect is insignificant .      in our previous paper on the distance of ngc 300 from optical photometry ( gieren et al .",
    "2004 ) , the effect on the cepheid magnitudes due to unresolved companion stars was extensively discussed , and it was concluded that the distance determination was not significantly affected by this problem .",
    "a confirmation of this conclusion has very recently come from vi photometry of some 25 cepheids in ngc 300 obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ and acs camera in six fields in ngc 300 , which agrees very well with the ground - based photometry of these stars ( bresolin et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "since our near - infrared images have an even better spatial resolution and are deeper than the optical images used in our previous study , and our selected fields for the near - infrared follow - up are not in the very dense central region of ngc 300 , we expect that crowding is even less a problem in the determination of the j and k magnitudes of our program cepheids than it was in the determination of their v- and i - band magnitudes .    from the previous discussion",
    ", we conclude that the value of our derived true distance modulus of ngc 300 has a total random error of 0.04 mag , and a total systematic uncertainty of about 0.03 mag ( which is by @xmath19 smaller than the @xmath20.04 mag uncertainty of each of the individual photometric zero points in the four bands we have used for the calculation of the true distance modulus ) .",
    "this estimate for the systematic error does , however , not include the contribution coming from the uncertainty on the adopted lmc distance of 18.5 mag , which is clearly the dominant source of systematic error on our derived distance to ngc 300 .",
    "as our final result from vijk photometry of cepheid variables in ngc 300 , we then find a true distance modulus of ngc 300 of @xmath1=26.37 @xmath0 0.04(random ) @xmath0 0.03(systematic ) mag ( excluding the systematic uncertainty on the lmc distance , which is difficult to estimate , and scaling our distance result to an adopted lmc true distance modulus of 18.50 ) .",
    "our derived distance value is more accurate than our previous determination of @xmath1=26.43 mag which we had derived from photometry in vi bands alone .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently found a distance modulus for ngc 300 of 26.56 @xmath0 0.07(random)@xmath0 0.13 ( systematic ) from hst - based photometry of the i - band magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "however , in their analysis they only used a galactic foreground reddening of 0.013 mag to calculate the absorption correction . using our improved value of e(b - v)=0.096 mag , which takes into account the intrinsic reddening in ngc 300 , the butler et al .",
    "value changes to 26.397 , in excellent agreement with the value derived from the cepheids in this paper . in the study of bresolin",

    "result , given that our hst i - band images are going about 2 mag deeper than those of butler , and were obtained for six acs fields .",
    "this study will provide a definitive measurement of the trgb magnitude in ngc 300 which will then be compared to our cepheid - based result .",
    "our new and definitive distance result for ngc 300 from cepheid variables is also in excellent agreement with the earlier result of madore et al .",
    "( 1987 ) who had found a true distance modulus of 26.35 @xmath0 0.25 mag from near - infrared ( h - band ) photometry of two long - period cepheids in ngc 300 . while the revised ngc 300 cepheid distance obtained by the hst key project team ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) from optical photometry of 26.53 @xmath0 0.07 mag ( also tied to a lmc distance modulus of 18.50 , as our present result in this paper ) seems at first glance in marginal disagreement with our result , this is not the case .",
    "freedman et al . used , as butler et al . ( 2004 ) in their trgb study , only the galactic foreground reddening to correct their ngc 300 distance modulus result for interstellar absorption . using our improved reddening value derived in this paper , their result changes to 26.31 @xmath0 0.07 , again in very good agreement with our result from a combination of optical and near - infrared photometry of the cepheids in ngc 300 .",
    "as a conclusion , all recent determinations of the distance of ngc 300 from cepheids and red giants agree with our determination within the combined 1 @xmath7 uncertainties if consistent reddening corrections are applied .",
    "it therefore seems that the _ relative _ distance of ngc 300 with respect to the lmc is now determined with an accuracy of about 3 percent .",
    "we have measured accurate near - infrared magnitudes in the j and k bands for 16 cepheid variables in ngc 300 with well - known periods and optical lightcurves .",
    "mean magnitudes were derived from our two - phase observations by using the correction procedure of soszyski et al .",
    "fits to the observed period - luminosity relations were made adopting the slopes derived from the lmc cepheids by persson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . by combining the values of the distance moduli derived in the optical vi and near - infrared jk bands , we have determined e(b - v)=0.096 @xmath0 0.006 as an accurate value for the total reddening appropriate for the ngc 300 cepheids . applying this reddening value to correct the observed distance moduli for absorption ,",
    "we obtain extremely consistent values for the true distance modulus of ngc 300 from each photometric band .",
    "our result is @xmath1(ngc 300)=26.37 @xmath0 0.04 ( random ) @xmath00.03 ( systematic ) mag , or ( 1.88 @xmath0 0.05 ) mpc .",
    "the random error of this result is dominated by the photometric noise of our observations and the relatively small sample size , whereas the systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty on the photometric zero points .",
    "our systematic uncertainty estimate does not include the contribution from the distance of the lmc , which we adopted as 18.50 mag .",
    "effects due to metallicity , reddening and blending are small and do not significantly affect the accuracy of our distance measurement .",
    "our distance result is also unaffected by a lutz - kelker bias related to the chosen period cutoff in the pl relation .",
    "the insensitivity of our distance determination to ngc 300 to metallicity is a consequence of near - identical metallicities of the young stellar populations in ngc 300 and in the lmc . applying the fiducial lmc pl relations in j and",
    "k to the cepheids in more metal - poor or metal - rich systems could cause a systematic effect on the derived distance if the zero points of the pl relations in j and/or k are affected by metallicity .",
    "similar work on galaxies with a range of metallicities should produce improved constraints on this important question .",
    "such studies are underway in our araucaria project .",
    "our distance determination for ngc 300 from combined optical / near - infrared photometry of cepheid variables is in very good agreement with the value determined from h - band photometry of 2 cepheids by madore et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , and with the more recent value of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from optical photometry when our improved reddening is applied to correct for interstellar absorption inside ngc 300 .",
    "our result is also in agreement with the distance determined by butler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from i - band photometry of the trgb in ngc 300 , if the additional reddening inside ngc 300 we have determined in this paper is taken into account .",
    "it therefore appears that the distance of ngc 300 relative to the lmc is now determined with an accuracy of about @xmath0 3% , mainly due to the improved accuracy we have been able to achieve in our present work .",
    "given the generally very good agreement between the mean j and k magnitudes of the cepheids derived from the individual single - phase observations , it will be a better strategy in the future to observe each field just once , and double the number of observed fields , and therefore approximately double the number of cepheids for the determination of the pl relation of a galaxy .",
    "this will help to reduce the random error due to a non - homogeneous filling of the instability strip without significantly increasing the photometric noise on the mean magnitudes .",
