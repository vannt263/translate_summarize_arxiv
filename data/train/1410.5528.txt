    "microgels become charged through dissociation of counterions from the polyelectrolyte backbones .",
    "the gel particles are then stabilized both sterically by dangling surface chains and electrostatically by electric charge .",
    "because of their permeability to solvent molecules and small ions , and the prevalence of electrostatic forces , whose strength and range depend on degree of ionization and salt concentration , ionic microgels display unusual structural and thermodynamic properties  @xcite that are distinct from those of impermeable charged colloids  @xcite .",

    "[ results ] , we present numerical results for structural and thermodynamic properties , specifically the macroion - macroion radial distribution function , the static structure factor , and the equation of state ( osmotic pressure vs. microgel density ) .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] concludes with a summary of our main results and suggestions for future work .",
    "underlying our investigations is the primitive model of polyelectrolytes  @xcite , which idealizes the solvent as a uniform medium . applied to microgel dispersions ,",
    "the model comprises spherical macroions and microions ( counterions and salt ions ) dispersed in a dielectric continuum , characterized only by a dielectric constant @xmath0 .",

    "the latter assumption is consistent with experiments , which indicate that crowding induces ionic microgel particles to de - swell only at concentrations approaching overlap  @xcite .    , or the cell model ( cm ) , consisting of a single macroion centered in a spherical cell along with microions . in all models , the solution can exchange microions ( in donnan equilibrium ) with an implicit salt reservoir . ]    further abstracting",
    ", we treat the microions as monovalent point ions ( valence @xmath3 ) .",
    "bulk electroneutrality relates the macroion number @xmath4 to the counterion and coion numbers @xmath5 via @xmath6 , assuming negative macroions . the total number of microions in the system can be expressed as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of salt ion pairs .",
    "equivalently , the corresponding ion number densities are related via @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",

    "the debye screening length , which characterizes the typical ion - ion correlation length , is at least 30 nm , justifying use of the primitive model .",
    "spherical microgels , consisting of cross - linked networks of polyelectrolyte chains , typically vary in size from tens of nanometers to microns . when dispersed in water , the chains of ionic microgels ( e.g. , pnipam ) can become charged through dissociation of protons or other oppositely charged counterions . the macroion size and charge",
    "may be adjusted by varying solution conditions ( e.g. , temperature and ph ) .",
    "the porous structure of the gel network allows water and microions to easily penetrate .",
    "condensation ( or close association ) of some of the counterions can reduce the effective charge of ionic microgels , while bare coulomb interactions between microgels are screened by mobile microions in solution .",
