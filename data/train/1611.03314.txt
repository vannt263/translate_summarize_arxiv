    "among the challenges of the glass transition is to understand how solidity , in the sense that no flow occurs on any relevant timescale , emerges with little apparent change in structure as seen in two point correlation functions .",
    "in fact , whether the glass transition has a thermodynamic ( implying structural ) or dynamical origin remains a matter of debate  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that upon cooling , icosahedral - like arrangements of atoms might form in the glassformer  @xcite and that the dynamical arrest may be related to a ( geometrically frustrated ) transition to a phase of such icosahedra  @xcite . to test these ideas studies",
    "have been carried out to identify geometric motifs such as icosahedra and related _ locally favored structures _ ( lfs ) by means of computer simulation @xcite and particle - resolved experiments on colloids @xcite .",
    "further experimental evidence of increasing numbers of lfs upon cooling is also found in metallic glassformers @xcite . although not all these studies agree wholeheartedly on the role of structure , nor indeed upon the type of structure that is relevant",
    ", what is clear is that in many glassformers some structural change does occur .",
    "in addition to this structural change , key to understanding the glass transition is the concept of dynamic heterogeneity , _",
    "i.e. _  the existence of locally fast and slow regions in the system @xcite",
    ". determining the nature of these heterogeneities ( probably ) lies at the heart of understanding the glass transition since competing theoretical interpretations envisage different behaviour for dynamically heterogeneous regions",
    ". we may divide the process of dynamical arrest into two principle regimes : the _ known _ and the _ unknown_. the known region corresponds to the first 3 - 5 decades of increase in structural relaxation time @xmath0 relative to the normal liquid .",
    "this region is _ known _ because particle resolved studies , i.e. molecular simulation and colloid experiment @xcite allow us to determine the particle coordinates and precisely probe the behaviour of the system .",
    "in addition we have in this regime a theoretical framework , the so - called `` mode - coupling theory '' ( mct )  @xcite , that is able to rationalize many aspects of the observed slowing down .",
    "alas , this known regime ends , due to the relaxation timescales approaching the experimental or simulation timescales , just as things begin to get interesting from the point of view of understanding the glass transition .",
    "this dark zone starts around @xmath1 , the critical temperature of mct , at which the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory @xcite predicts that the nature of the dynamical heterogeneities changes : for temperatures slightly above @xmath1 the so - called cooperatively rearranging regions ( crrs ) that reflect the dynamical entities that are related to the regions of fast dynamics are relatively diffuse , whereas below @xmath1 they become more compact . for temperatures well below @xmath1 the size of the crrs is predicted to grow until they reach the size of the system at the kauzmann temperature @xmath2 .",
    "one consequence of this scenario is that the configurational entropy becomes sub - extensive and a thermodynamic phase transition to an ideal glass occurs is reached at @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "clear evidence in support of this scenario around the mode - coupling transition has been obtained from simulations that found that the @xmath3dependence of the size of dynamically heterogeneous regions is non - monotonic for temperatures around @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is thus consistent with the existence of more compact regions at deep supercooling .",
    "although not all measures of dynamic lengthscales exhibit this temperature dependence @xcite , and the feature might even be system - specific @xcite , a change in this dependence can be found for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "some evidence for this behaviour has also been obtained in colloidal experiments @xcite . however , since it is very hard to equilibrate colloidal systems suitable for particle - resolved studies at densities beyond the mode - coupling transition @xcite , the use of this technique is somewhat limited .",
    "of course simulations also have difficulties to access the interesting temperature regime but at present it appears possible to equilibrate at somewhat deeper supercooling with simulation than _ particle - resolved _ colloid experiments @xcite .",
    "the very deep supercooling regime in which the crr size are expected to grow significantly appears to elude even experiments on molecular liquids , _",
    "i.e. _  systems for which one can reach timescales that are 14 - 15 decades larger than the relaxation time of the normal liquid @xcite . while for supercooled molecular liquids it is not possible to directly determine the size of the crrs , a variety of indirect techniques have been employed , all of which indicate that at the experimental glass transition temperature @xmath5 , at which the viscosity has reached @xmath6pa@xmath7s , the size of the crrs is only around 10 - 100 molecules , thus a far cry from showing a divergence @xcite .",
    "there is also the standpoint that the slow dynamics is not related to an underlying thermodynamic transition but that the glassiness is due to `` dynamic facilitation ''  @xcite .",
    "this approach predicts that so - called excitations ( defect - like mobile regions ) become increasingly sparser if temperature is decreased , yet remain essentially unaltered in their nature .",
    "for realistic systems the direct measurement of these excitations , which can be hard to accurately identify for off - lattice systems , is again limited to the @xmath8 regime , making it thus difficult to carry out stringent tests of this concept .",
    "but one can say that , like the agreement noted above for rfot , facilitation also describes the dynamically heterogeneous regions in the regime accessible to simulation / colloid experiments rather well @xcite .",
    "moreover both dynamic facilitation @xcite and rfot @xcite have been shown to give reasonable predictions about the behaviour of molecular glassformers at supercoolings much greater than those accessible to simulation or colloid experiments . in short , at present we lack a way to definitively distinguish between competing theoretical approaches , even though the shapes of the dynamically heterogeneous regions  becoming more compact and growing upon supercooling for rfot , and staying similar in nature but becoming more sparse in the case of dynamic facilitation suggests that this might be a fruitful avenue of research to discriminate between these theories .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a possible measurement method which may indeed enable such a discrimination .",
    "returning to the role of local structure , we observe that attempts to correlate it with dynamic heterogeneity , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the dynamically slow regions should be in the locally favoured structures , has met with some success @xcite",
    ". however , the existence of such a correlation does by itself _ not _ reveal a mechanism for arrest @xcite and in any case is dependent on the system under consideration @xcite .",
    "a key limitation here is that direct detection of the lfs and dynamic heterogeneity is only possible in the first 3 - 5 decades of dynamic slowing accessible to colloids and computer simulation , i.e.  a region in the dynamic range where there might be cross - over effects from the high temperature to the low temperature dynamics .    in this contribution to",
    "the special issue `` structure in glassy and jammed systems '' , we present two related results .",
    "firstly , using simulations of a weakly polydisperse hard sphere system that is more deeply supercooled than those analysed to date @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a decade in the dynamics past the mode - coupling transition which we take as a packing fraction @xmath9 following van megen _",
    "we find an enhanced correlation between local structure and dynamically slow regions .",
    "this local structure , the icosahedron , is more compact than that observed previously @xcite .",
    "secondly , we introduce a new approach to characterise the shapes of cooperatively rearranging regions . in the regime accessible to our simulations",
    ", we find that their shapes are rather similar , and that the size of the crrs seems to grow slower than the four - point dynamic correlation length often used , but find instead that it is rather well described by the lengthscale based on correlations in dynamic propensity @xcite .",
    "a variety of lengthscales have been proposed in connection with the glass transition .",
    "some are based on structural quantities @xcite and others on dynamical heterogeneity @xcite . among the quantities underlying some dynamic lengthscales",
    "is the _ dynamic susceptibility _ @xmath11 given by    @xmath12 \\quad \\mbox{with } \\quad q(t):=\\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{n=1}^n w(|\\textbf{r}_n(t)-\\textbf{r}_n(0)| )   \\label{eqchi4}\\ ] ]    and which is obtained by integrating a four - point time - dependent density correlation function over volume @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is unity in the case that a particle has moved less than some distance ( often , as is the case here , chosen to be @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the diameter of the particles ) and zero otherwise . for a given temperature @xmath16 ( or packing fraction @xmath17 ) , the fluctuations ( i.e.",
    ", the susceptibility @xmath11 ) attain a maximum at a certain time @xmath18 , and then die away , as shown in section  [ sectionresults ] .",
    "the time @xmath19 has a value similar to the structural relaxation time @xmath20 .",
    "we note that the exact nature of the increase of the dynamic length scale is so far unclear , and in fact depends upon the system under consideration .    the quantity @xmath21 is related to the collective cooperative dynamics of the particles .",
    "it can be easily generalized to the four - point dynamic structure factor @xmath22 , a quantity that informs on this dynamics on a lengthscale defined by a wave - vector @xmath23 , and that is defined by    @xmath24w(|\\textbf{r}_j(0)-\\textbf{r}_l(t)| )   \\\\ & \\times & \\sum_{mn } \\exp[i \\textbf{k } \\cdot \\textbf{r}_m(0)]w(|\\textbf{r}_m(0)-\\textbf{r}_n(t)| ) \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are particle indices . for time",
    "@xmath30 , the orientationally averaged version is @xmath31 .",
    "its @xmath32dependence may then be fitted with an ornstein - zernicke relation to obtain a dynamic correlation length @xmath33 ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is a fitting parameter .",
    "the obtained dynamic correlation length @xmath36 can been fitted by a critical - like power - law with the mode - coupling temperature as the transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "we emphasise , however , that a number of other fits are possible with a divergence at @xmath37  @xcite , or at @xmath38 obtained from fitting the data with a vogel - fulcher expression  @xcite , but also scalings which couple to the relaxation time can be done  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the divergence of @xmath10 can be associated with the temperature to where one imagines @xmath0 to diverge  @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "such a variation reflects the fact that in practice the observable range over which @xmath10 varies is less than one decade , so discussions of divergence require a considerable degree of faith .",
    "in other words , measuring @xmath10 from simulation data does ( so far ) not enable discrimination between different theories @xcite .",
    "the results on the various systems that have been investigated so far indicate that the dynamic correlation length @xmath10 is almost always larger than the static correlation lengths from structural measures such as geometric motifs  lfs  or so called `` order - agnostic '' measures @xcite .",
    "this fact challenges the idea that the glass transition is a thermodynamic phenomenon : if there is some kind of underlying lengthscale associated with arrest , then structural lengthscales should surely be proportional to the dynamic lengthscales @xcite .    to address this issue ,",
    "one of us ( cpr ) has also introduced another length , based on information theoretic quantities .",
    "details may be found in @xcite , but the essence is as follows : in the iso - configurational ensemble where many ( in our case 2048 ) realisations are run independently from the same starting configuration @xcite , particles have a _ propensity _ for being mobile - or immobile . as a consequence , across the ensemble of trajectories ,",
    "particles have a probability distribution of mobility . by measuring the spatial correlations in this mobility one can obtain a dynamic lengthscale @xmath41 , where `` rg '' stands for radius of gyration of the so - obtained clusters . here",
    "clusters of particles were identified in terms of the mutual information between the mobility distribution of each particle across the isoconfigurational ensemble . in terms of the mutual information , it was found that the mobility of each particle is strongly correlated with a few neighbours , which defines the cluster .",
    "the number of neighbours was found to be maximised at a time very close to the structural relaxation time @xmath0 .",
    "this dynamic lengthscale turns out to increase less than does @xmath10 and is in fact comparable to structural measures .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "another possibility to define a dynamic length scale has been proposed in refs .",
    "there the idea was to probe the details of the shape of the crrs by looking at the relaxation dynamics of the system in the vicinity of an amorphous wall .",
    "also in that case it was found that the extracted dynamic length increases at a smaller rate than does @xmath10 .",
    "these two examples show that one can come up with definitions of dynamical length scales that are reasonable and that result in scales that have a @xmath3dependence that is not too different from the one found for static scales . in the following",
    "we will thus follow this idea and see how the various scales compare with each other .",

    "we thus consider three species of local structures which we count as follows .",
    "the nine - membered lus are simply expressed as the fraction of particles in an lus . to define the concentration of the lfs ( full or defective icosahedra ) we consider all the particles that are in one of these structures .",
    "note that since a particle can belong to more that one of these structures , the total concentrations of structures can add to more than 1.0 . while there are other possibilities for counting the local structures , we emphasise that these have no effect on our conclusions , and obvious choices have very little quantitative impact ,    in fig .  [ fignls ] we show the fraction of particles belonging to the different local environments as a function of the compressibility factor @xmath67 , accessing now values of @xmath67 that so far have been unattainable .",

    "secondly , the fraction of particles that are both slow and in these full icosahedra ( blue open symbols ) increases with @xmath67 and account at the highest densities for about 80% of the particles in the icosahedra , i.e.  well beyond the trivial statistical expectation of 50% . from this",
    "we thus can conclude that with increasing glassiness of the system an increasing fraction of the slow particles forms part of a full icosahedron .",
    "thirdly , the number of lus ( orange filled symbols ) is basically independent of @xmath68 and the number of particles that are in the lus _ and _ are fast ( orange open symbols ) makes up only about 50% of the total and show a weak trend to _",
    "decrease_. this indicates that there seems to be rather little correlation between lus and dynamically fast particles and thus the life time of the lus is not short because its constituent particles are fast .",
    "we emphasize that we do not expect the trend of increasing populations of icosahedra to continue all the way to random close packing .",
    "provided the system can be equilibrated , one of us ( cpr ) has shown that there is an increase in fivefold symmetry , but that when it falls out of equilibrium , the degree of fivefold symmetry is much reduced ; and tetrahedra symmetry is found instead @xcite .",

    "we now introduce a new approach to determine the shape of dynamically heterogeneous regions and from this a new dynamic length scale .",
    "this method is motivated by the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite evidence was found that the shape of the crrs depends on the packing fraction ( or temperature ) , in qualitative agreement with the prediction by rfot  @xcite .",
    "since these structures might have fractal - like properties it is not very appropriate to try to characterize their size with a naively chosen length scale and hence we propose here instead an approach inspired from the analysis of fractal - like objects .",
    "in particular we analyse their structure using a box counting algorithm . for this",
    "we determine @xmath70 , the probability that a cubic box of size @xmath27 that is placed randomly in the sample contains at least one particle that has a certain property ( to be defined below ) .",
    "since the values of @xmath70 that are relevant for the present study are close to unity , it is useful to discuss not @xmath70 but @xmath71 , i.e.  the probability that a box does _ not _ contain any particle with the selective property .",
    "thus in contrast to the various length scales that can be found in the literature and that focus on the structures of interest ( lfs , lus , ... ) , we look here at the _ complementary _ space of these structures . before presenting the results ,",
    "we discuss briefly the interpretation of the method we use here . in short , we measure the `` fuzziness '' of the various regions .",
    "this is characterised by the rapidity with which @xmath71 falls as @xmath27 is increased .",

    "the grey data points correspond to the box - counting for all particles . as expected for dense assemblies of spheres , once the box size becomes comparable to the particle size , the probability that a box is empty plummets . in the case of fast particles , fig .",
    "[ fignn](a ) , somewhat larger boxes can be inserted , but when the box size @xmath27 is around that of the mutual information length @xmath41 , the chance to insert an empty box falls quite quickly .",
    "this decrease is , however , not as fast as in the case of all particles which indicates that the complementary space of the set of fast particles has an irregular structure , a result that does not surprise given the irregular shape of the fast regions .",
    "however , since there is no indication for a power - law in our data , we can conclude that _ at the lengthscales we access , _ this complimentary space is not fractal - like .",
    "once @xmath27 has reached the size of @xmath10 , the probability has basically gone to zero , showing that the typical distance between clusters of fast particles is significantly smaller than @xmath10 . also included in the graph is the data for the lus .",
    "we see that this probability starts to decay to zero in a manner that is very similar to the one we observed for the fast particles .",
    "the main difference is that the length scale at which this decay starts is now a factor 2 - 3 larger , which is reasonable since these structures account only for about 10% of the particles whereas the fast particles account for 50% ( see fig .",
    "[ fignls ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fignn](b ) we show the corresponding probabilities for the slowly moving particles and the lfs .",
    "note that , since about 50% of the particles are slow and 50% are fast , the regions that are fast are basically the complement of the regions that are slow , and _ vice versa_. we recognize that the @xmath74dependence of the curve for the slowly moving particles is quite similar to the one for the lfs and that the latter decays at a length scale that is about a factor of four larger than the one for the fast particles . in view of the relative concentrations of these structures / particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fignls ] ) this factor is again quite reasonable .",

    "[ figcrrshapesphi ] we plot the probability to find an empty box as a function of its size ( in units of @xmath15 ) .",
    "we recognize that this distribution depends only weakly on the packing fraction , which is in agreement with the usual finding that the length scales associated with fast / slow domains do not change strongly with the degree of supercooling .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that with increasing packing fraction the curves have the tendency to move to the right , indicating that the shape of the region with the fast moving particles become better defined and take up less space , also this in qualitative agreement with previous findings .",
    "the data from panel ( b ) tells a similar message , namely that the shape of the curves , and hence the shape of the domains , changes only weakly with @xmath17 .",

    "this is revealed by the fact that the @xmath71 curves moving to _ smaller _ values of @xmath78 upon deeper supercooling .",
    "remarkably , by scaling @xmath27 by @xmath41 , we find that @xmath79 changes little .",
    "it is thus possible to interpret @xmath41 as an appropriate lengthscale when considering crrs .",
    "while we emphasise that `` one swallow does nt make a spring '' , we observe that in fig .",
    "[ figcrrshapesphi](e ) , it is possible to convince oneself that perhaps the fall - off of @xmath71 is less steep at deeper supercooling .",
    "this would imply more diffuse crrs as predicted by rfot @xcite .",
    "we have carried out a structural analysis of configurations of a weakly polydisperse hard sphere system at a deeper supercooling than previously accessed , a decade in dynamics past the mode - coupling transition .",
    "we reveal the emergence of a locally favoured structure , whose population is small at weaker supercooling .",
    "this is the `` canonical '' icosahedron predicted long ago @xcite . at these deeper supercoolings ,",
    "the lfs correlate well with the slow particles .",
    "this tells us that , under our criterion for fast and slow particles , there is effectively a change in lfs from defective icosahedra at weaker supercooling @xcite to full icosahedra , indicating that these lfs are a feature of deeper supercooling than that at which most of the simulation ( and colloid experiment ) investigations have been made .",
    "we note , however , that the present results might be restricted to hard - sphere like systems that are ( basically ) mono - disperse , _",
    "i.e. _  liquids in which there is no finite attraction / repulsion or chemical order that could give rise to lfs that have a more complex shape / composition .",
    "we have developed a new means to measure the shapes of crrs which is inspired by the analysis of fractal objects . in the regime of supercooling",
    "accessible to the present simulations , the crr shape , related to the manner @xmath71 decays , appears to change little .",
    "the absolute size of these regions increases , as usual , only moderately with increasing packing fraction .",
    "when these distributions are plotted as a function of a dynamic lengthscale based on mutual information , @xmath41 @xcite , we find a reasonable master curve which indicates that the shape of the crrs does not depend strongly on @xmath17 .",
    "this master curve also shows that @xmath41 does indeed capture the size of the crrs , which is not the case for @xmath10 since the latter does not lead to a data collapse .",
    "instead our analysis indicates that with supercooling @xmath10 increases rather faster than the size of the crrs .",
    "one of the motivations for this work was to see whether it is possible to detect in a bulk system any sign for a non - monotonic dynamic length scale .",
    "our analysis gives no clear signature for such an effect , although certain quantities , e.g.  the distribution for the slow particles shown in fig .  [ figcrrshapesphi](b ) , might hint that such a non - monotonic behavior does indeed exist .",
    "_ if _  this is indeed the case this would thus open the door for analysing in a simple manner other glass - forming systems _ in the bulk _",
    ", thus avoiding the somewhat complex setup used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( freezing in of an amorphous wall ) .",
    "the possible absence of the non - monotonic behavior in the dynamical length scale for the present system might not be a total surprise since it has been found that a binary lennard - jones model did not show such a non - monotonic behavior either  @xcite .",
    "of course , it is entirely possible that , at deeper supercoolings , we may find in the present system some non - monotonicity in the correlation length .",
    "on the other hand it should be recalled that this feature might be closely related to the fragility of the glass - former ( in the sense of angell ) since fragile systems show a more pronounced change in the activation energy , _",
    "i.e. _  a change of slope in an arrhenius plot of the relaxation time . this change of slope is one of the main features of mct ( and therefore of rfot ) that predicts in effect a singularity in the dynamics , which , however , is cut - off by hopping processes that are not taken into account in the simplest forms of the theory .",
    "thus rfot can be expected to work better for fragile systems and in view of the fact that the harmonic sphere system of ref .",
    "@xcite is more fragile than the polydisperse hard sphere system considered here , which in turn is more fragile than the binary lennard - jones system of ref .",
    "@xcite , the absence of a clear signature for a non - monotonic behavior is not that surprising , in agreement with other work  @xcite . to summarize",
    "we can conclude that the approach presented here allows to gain information on the properties of the crrs without making any assumptions on their nature or shape",
    ". therefore it will be very interesting to see what this method finds for other glass - forming systems notably for those for which one seeks to understand well the nature of the relaxation dynamics and the associated length scales .",
