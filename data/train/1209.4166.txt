    "quantum correlations in many - particle systems are responsible for the performance of the quantum devices ( in particular , quantum computers ) and give them significant advantages over their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "until recently it was believed @xcite that entanglement is responsible for quantum correlations @xcite , and quantum devices can be created only on the basis of materials which can be easily prepared in entangled states @xcite .",
    "however , it turned out that one can work out quantum algorithms  @xcite which significantly outperform their classical counterparts by mixing separable ( non - entangled ) states .",
    "it also turned out that quantum non - locality can be observed in systems without entanglement @xcite . from this",
    ", one can conclude that entanglement describes only a part of quantum correlations but not all of them .    according to the current understanding @xcite , total correlations , quantum and classical ,",
    "are determined by the mutual information @xcite .",
    "the problem is how to divide the correlations into quantum and classical ones .",
    "the problem was solved independently by henderson and vedral  @xcite as well as independently ollivier and zurek  @xcite . the classical correlation in a binary system",
    "is determined by the total set of projective measurements carried out only for its one subsystem  @xcite . then the quantum correlation measure ( the quantum discord )",
    "is determined as the difference between the mutual information and its classical part optimized over all possible projective measurements @xcite .",
    "the quantum discord is determined completely by quantum properties of the system and equals zero for classical systems .",
    "a calculation of the quantum discord is a complex problem because it is necessary to execute many - parametric optimization .",
    "therefore , analytic calculations for the discord are possible only in simple two - qubit systems @xcite .",
    "a special attention was devoted to a connection of the quantum discord and physical parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "such investigations open a direct way to experimental measurements of the discord . in the present article",
    "we investigate theoretically the entanglement and quantum discord in a thin silicon film containing close nanopores filled with a a gas of spin - carrying molecules ( atoms ) with spin @xmath0 in a strong external magnetic field .",
    "nmr line shape in such films was studied experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "fast molecular motion in nanopores do not average the dipole - dipole interactions ( ddi ) completely ( space confinement ) and the residual ddi is described by one coupling constant which is the same for all pairs of interacting spins @xcite . reducing the density matrix ( which describes the time evolution of the system with the residual ddi ) over all spins except the chosen pair one can obtain information about the pair entanglement and quantum discord in the system .",
    "the main goal of this article is the investigation of entanglement and quantum discord of spin pair in the nanopore filled with a gas of spin - carrying molecules ( atoms ) .",
    "it is also significant that the reduced density matrix in the considered model is centrosymmetric ( cs ) @xcite . in the present article",
    "we obtain an analytic expression for the concurrence @xcite of an arbitrary @xmath1 cs density matrix . the geometric discord for an arbitrary @xmath1 cs - matrix is also calculated .",

    "since @xmath35 @xmath36 , the condition of the normalization of the density matrix leads to @xmath37        consider an arbitrary spin pair . without loss of generality",

    "one of them depends only on spins 1 and 2 while the other operator depends on spins 3 , 4 , ... @xmath2 and equals the product of one - spin operators .",
