    "a consequence of the vast expressiveness of human language is that natural language understanding ( nlu ) can not scale to _ general language _",
    "input unless it is willing to make some compromises for the sake of practicality and robustness .",
    "one such compromise made in most state - of - the - art natural language processing technologies ( e.g. , syntactic parsing ) is that the computational model of language is not a complete model of human grammatical knowledge , but rather , a set of soft preferences derived by statistical learning algorithms from large human - annotated datasets .",
    "thus , a strategy for advancing the state - of - the - art in nlu is to focus linguists descriptive effort on _ annotation schemes _ and _ datasets _ : annotating corpora with semantic information , for instance , so that formal cues ( denotational or contextual ) can be automatically associated with meaning representations .",
    "a representation will necessarily be limited in the level of detail it provides ( its _ granularity _ ) and/or the range of linguistic expressions that it is prepared to describe ( its _ coverage _ ) .",
    "the principles of construction grammar can inform corpus annotations even if they fall short of full - fledged constructional parses .",
    "mindful of this granularity  coverage tradeoff , we have sought to develop a scheme that will be of practical value for broad - coverage human annotation , and therefore domain - general nlu , for a particular set of lexicogrammatical markers : * prepositions * in english , and more generally , * adpositions * and * case markers * across languages . forming a relatively closed class , these markers are incredibly versatile , and therefore exceptionally challenging to characterize semantically , let alone disambiguate automatically ( [ sec : lit ] ) .    as a first step ,",
    "we describe * preposition supersenses * , which target a coarse level of granularity and support comprehensive coverage of types and tokens in english .",
    "however , in attempting to generalize this approach to other languages , we uncovered a major weakness : it does not distinguish the contribution of the preposition itself , i.e. , what the adposition * codes * for , from the semantic role or relation that the adposition mediates and that a predicate or scene * calls * for ; and as a result , the label that would be most appropriate is underdetermined for many tokens ( [ sec : problems ] ) . in our view , the mismatch can be understood through the lens of * construal * and should be made explicit , leveraging the principles of construction grammar ( [ sec : construal ] ) . [",
    "sec : applying_bipartite ] surveys some of the phenomena that our new analysis addresses ; [ sec : challenges ] discusses the tradeoffs inherent in the proposed approach .",
    "finally , we sketch how our proposal would fit into a compositional constructional analysis of adpositional phrases ( [ sec : cxg_discussion ] ) .",
    "the most frequent english prepositions are extraordinarily polysemous . for example",
    ", the preposition * * expresses different information in each of the following usages :    nlu systems , when confronted with a new instance of * * , must determine whether it marks an entity or scene s location , time , instrument , or something else .",
    "as lexical classes go , prepositions are something of a red - headed stepchild in the linguistics literature .",
    "most of the semantics literature on prepositions has revolved around how they categorize space and time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there have been a couple of lines of work addressing preposition semantics broadly . in cognitive linguistics ,",
    "studies have examined abstract as well as concrete uses of english prepositions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "notably , the polysemy of * * and other prepositions has been explained in terms of sense networks encompassing core senses and motivated extensions @xcite . the preposition project ( tpp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) broke ground in stimulating computational work on fine - grained word sense disambiguation of english prepositions @xcite .",
    "typologists , meanwhile , have developed _ semantic maps _ of functions , where the nearness of two functions reflects their tendency to fall under the same adposition or case marker in many languages @xcite .",
    "[ [ preposition - supersenses . ] ] preposition supersenses .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    following @xcite , we sought coarse - grained semantic categories of prepositions as a broader - coverage alternative to fine - grained senses . because we want our labels to generalize across languages , we use categories similar to those appearing in semantic maps ( , , etc . )  rather than lexicalized senses .",
    "we identified a set of such categories through extensive deliberation involving the use of dictionaries , corpora and pilot annotation experiments @xcite .",
    "we call these categories * supersenses * to emphasize their similarity to coarse - grained classifications of nouns and verbs that go by that name @xcite .",
    "the * * examples in [ ex : at ] are accompanied by the appropriate supersenses from our scheme .",
    "most supersenses resemble thematic roles , in the tradition begun by @xcite ; a few others are needed to describe preposition - marked relations between entities .",
    "there are multiple english prepositions per supersense ; e.g. , `` * * the city '' and `` * * the table '' would join `` * * 123 main st . '' in being labeled as s. we understand the supersenses as prototype - based categories , and in some cases use heuristics like paraphraseability ( `` in order to '' for ) and wh - question words ( `` why ? '' for and ) to help determine which tokens are instances of the category .",
    "the 75  supersenses are organized in a taxonomy based on that of verbnet @xcite , with , , and at the top level .",
    "the taxonomy uses multiple inheritance to account for subcategories which are considered to include properties of multiple supercategories .",
    "the full hierarchy appears in [ fig : hierarchy ] .",
    "our approach to preposition annotation is _ comprehensive _ , i.e. , every token of every preposition type is given a supersense label .",
    "we applied the supersenses to annotate a 55,000 word corpus of online reviews in english , covering all 4,250 preposition tokens @xcite . for each token , annotators chose a single label from the inventory .",
    "this is not an easy task , but with documentation of many examples in a lexical resource , * prepwiki * , trained university students were able to achieve reasonable levels of inter - annotator agreement .",
    "every token was initially labeled by at least two independent annotators , and differences were adjudicated by experts .",
    "while the above approach worked reasonably well for most english tokens , a few persistent issues arising in english and other languages have led us to revisit fundamental assumptions about what it means to semantically label an adposition .      in our original english annotation @xcite ,",
    "a few phenomena caused us much hand - wringing  not because there was no appropriate supersense , but because _ multiple _ supersenses seemed to fit .",
    "for example , we found that and could compete for semantic territory .",
    "[ ex : about - topic ]  evinces related usages of * * with different governors :    the first three usages could reasonably be labeled as .",
    "this is because the * * -pp indicates what is communicated [ ex : book - about , ex : read - about ] and known [ ex : know - about ] .",
    "the fourth example [ ex : care - about ] , however , presents an overlap in its interpretation . on the one hand ,",
    "traditional thematic role inventories include the category for something that prompts a perceptual or emotional experience , as in [ ex : afraid - of ] .    surely , _ cared _ in [ ex : care - about ] describes an emotional state , so * * marks the . however , much like examples [ ex : book - about , ex : read - about , ex : know - about ] , the semantics relating to is still very much present in the use of * * , which draws attention to the aspects of the caring process involving thought or judgement .",
    "this sits in contrast to the use of * * in `` i cared * * my grandmother , '' where the prepositional choice calls attention to the benefactive aspect of the caring act .",
    "if we are constrained to one label per argument , where should the line be drawn between and in cases of overlap ? in other words , should the semantic representation emphasize the semantic commonality between all of the examples in [ ex : about - topic ] , or between [ ex : care - about ] and [ ex : afraid - of ] ?",
    "observing that annotators were inconsistent on such tokens , we drew a boundary between and in an attempt to force consistency .",
    "below , we instead argue that the idea of construal / conceptualization offers a more principled answer ; in our new analysis , the suggested by * * and the suggested by _ cared _ can coexist .",
    "one of the premises of using unlexicalized supersenses was that the scheme would port well to other languages ( as the wordnet noun and verb supersenses have : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* _ inter alia _ ) ) . to test this ,",
    "we have begun applying the existing supersenses to three new languages , namely , hebrew , hindi , and korean . pilot annotation in these languages has echoed the fundamental problem discussed in the previous section .",
    "consider the hindi examples below .",
    "in [ ex : bipasha ] , the experiencer of an emotion is marked with a postposition * * , the genitive case marker in hindi .",
    "the use of * * strongly suggests possession ( here it is possession of an abstract quality ) .",
    "however , the semantics of the phrase also includes thus , it seems inappropriate to choose between and for this token .",
    "( the same problem is encountered with a similar phrase `` the anger * * bipasha '' in english . )",
    "there are other ways to attribute anger to bipasha  e.g . ,",
    "see [ ex : counter_bipasha ] . here",
    "bipasha is not construed as a possessor when the postposition * * is not used .",
    "our preliminary annotation of hindi , korean , and hebrew has suggested that instances of overlap between multiple supersenses are fairly frequent .",
    "why do `` cared * * the strategy '' in [ ex : care - about ] and `` anger * * bipasha '' in [ ex : bipasha ] above not lend themselves to a single label ?",
    "these seem to be symptoms of the fact that no english preposition prototypically marks or roles , though from the perspective of the predicates , such roles are thought to be important generalizations in characterizing events of perception and emotion .",
    "in essence , there is an apparent mismatch between the roles that the verb _ care _ or the noun _ anger _",
    "calls for , and the functions that english prepositions prototypically code for . while * * prototypically codes for and * * prototypically codes for , there is no preposition that `` naturally '' codes for or in the same way . thus ,",
    "if a predicate marks an or with a preposition , the preposition will contribute something new to the conceptualization of the scene being described . with",
    "`` cared * * the strategy , '' it is -ness that the preposition brings to the table ; with `` anger * * bipasha , '' it is the conceptualization of anger as an attribute that somebody possesses .",
    "thus , we turn to the theories in cognitive semantics to define the phenomenon of * construal * as a means of understanding the contributions that are emerging from the adpositions with respect to the expressed event or situation . then , we turn to the guiding principles of construction grammar to develop a method called * bipartite analysis * in order to handle the problem posed by construals and to resolve the apparent semantic overlap which is pervasive across languages .",
    "the world is not neatly organized into bits of information that map directly to linguistic symbols .",
    "rather , linguistic meaning reflects the priorities and categorizations of particular expressions in a language ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  3 ) .",
    "much like pictures of a scene from different viewpoints will result in different renderings , a real - world situation being described will `` look '' different depending on the linguistic choices made by a speaker .",
    "this includes within - language choices : e.g. , the choice of `` john sold mary a book '' vs.  `` john sold a book to mary '' vs.  `` mary bought a book from john . '' in the process called * construal * ( a.k.a .  *",
    "conceptualization * ) , a speaker `` packages '' ideas for linguistic expression in a way that foregrounds certain elements of a situation while backgrounding others .",
    "we propose to incorporate this notion of construal in adposition supersense annotation .",
    "we use the term * scene * to refer to events or situations in which an adpositional phrase plays a role .",
    "( we do not formalize the full scene , but assume its roles can be characterized with supersense labels from [ fig : hierarchy ] . )",
    "contrast the use of the prepositions * * and * * in [ ex : puccini ] : while both prepositional phrases indicate works created by the operatic composer puccini ( i.e. , ) , the different choices of preposition reflect different construals : * * highlights the agency of puccini , whereas * * construes puccini as the source of his composition .",
    "thus , `` works * * puccini '' and `` works * * puccini '' are paraphrases , but present subtly different portrayals of the relationship between puccini and his works . in other words , these paraphrases are not identical in meaning because the preposition carries with it different nuances of construal . in this paper , we focus on differences in construal manifested in different adposition choices , and the possibility that an adposition construal complements the construal of a scene and its roles ( as evoked by the governing head or predicate ) .    for instances like",
    "`` i read * * the strategy '' in [ ex : read - about ] that were generally unproblematic for annotation under the original preposition guidelines , the semantics of the adposition and the semantic role assigned by the predicate are congruent . however , for examples like `` cared * * the strategy '' in [ ex : care - about ] and `` anger * * bipasha '' in [ ex : bipasha ] , we say that the adposition construes the role as something other than what the scene specifies .",
    "competition between different adposition construals accounts for many of the alternations that are near - paraphrases , but potentially involve slightly different nuances of meaning ( e.g. , `` talk * * someone '' vs.  `` talk * * someone '' ; `` angry * * someone '' vs.  `` angry * * someone '' ) .",
    "thus , the notion of construal challenges @xcite s ( @xcite ) original conception that each supersense reflects the semantic role assigned by its governing predicate ( i.e.  verbal or event nominal predicate ) , and that a single supersense label can be assigned to each adposition token .",
    "rather than trying to ignore these construals to favor a single - label approach , or possibly create new labels to capture the meaning distinctions that construals impose on semantic roles , we adopt an approach that gives us the flexibility to deal with both the semantics coming from the scene as well as the construals imposed by the adpositional choice .",
    "we address the issues of construal by proposing a * bipartite analysis * that decouples the semantics signaled by the adposition from the role expected by the scene .",
    "essentially , we borrow from construction grammar @xcite the notion that semantic contributions can be made at various levels of syntactic structure , beginning with the semantics contributed by the lexical items .    under our original single - label analysis ,",
    "the full weight of semantic assignment rested on the predicate s semantic role , with the indirect assumption that the predicate selects for adpostions relevant to the assignment . under the bipartite analysis",
    ", we assign semantics at both scene and adposition levels of meaning : we capture what the scene _",
    "calls _ for , henceforth * scene role * and what the adposition itself _ codes _ for , henceforth * function*. both labels are drawn from the supersense hierarchy ( [ fig : hierarchy ] ) . allowing tokens to be annotated with both a role and a function accounts for the non - congruent adposition construals , as in [ ex : puccini2 ] .",
    "bipartite analysis recognizes that both of these sentences carry the meaning represented by the supersense at the scene level , but also allows for the construal that arises from the chosen preposition : * * is assigned the function of and * * is assigned the function of .",
    "our bipartite annotation scheme does not require a syntactic parse .",
    "it therefore does not provide a full account of constructional compositionality .",
    "the scene that the pp elaborates may take a variety of syntactic forms ; we aim to train annotators to interpret the scene without annotating its lexical / syntactic form explicitly . in [ sec : cxg_discussion ] , we sketch how a compositional construction grammar analysis could capture the function and the scene role at different levels of structure .",
    "in this section , we discuss some of the more productive examples of non - congruent construals in english as well as in hindi , korean , and hebrew .",
    "hereafter , we will use the notation @xmath0 to indicate such construals . adopting the `` realization '' metaphor of articulating an idea linguistically ,",
    "this can be read as `` is realized with an adposition that marks . ''",
    "scenes of emotion and perception @xcite provide a compelling case for the bipartite construal analysis .",
    "consider the sentences involving emotion in example [ ex : scared ] :    comparing examples [ ex : bear ] and [ ex : job ] , we notice that there are two different types of stimuli represented in otherwise semantically parallel sentences .",
    "the preposition * * gives the impression that the stimulus is responsible for triggering an instinctive fear reflex ( i.e. , ) , while * * portrays the thing feared as the content or of thought .    in some languages",
    ", the experiencer can be conceptualized as a recipient of the emotion or feeling , thus licensing dative marking . in the hebrew example [ ex :",
    "hot_to_me ] , the experiencer of bodily perception is marked with the dative preposition * * @xcite .",
    "similarly , in hindi , the dative postpostion * * marks an experiencer in [ ex : seems_hot_to_me ] .",
    "contrast this with examples where scene role and adposition function are congruent :    in [ ex : easy1 ] and [ ex : easy2 ] , the preposition is prototypical for the given scene role and its function directly identifies the scene role . because the semantics of the role and function are congruent , these cases do not exhibit the extra layer of construal seen in [ ex : scared ] and [ ex : dative - experiencers ] .",
    "should be annotated as @xmath0 .",
    "we do not discount the possibility that such a metaphor can be cognitively active in speakers using temporal adpositions ; in fact , there is considerable evidence that time - as - space metaphors are cross - linguistically pervasive and productive @xcite .",
    "however , we do not see much practical benefit to annotating temporal * * or topical * * as spatial .",
    "] in essence , the bipartite analysis help capture the construals that characterize the less prototypical scene role and function pairings .      our online reviews corpus @xcite shows that , at least in english , professional relationships ( especially employer  employee and business  client ones ) are fertile ground for alternating preposition construals .",
    "the following were among the examples tagged as : all of these construals are _ motivated _ in that they highlight an aspect of prototypical professional relationships : e.g. , an employee s work prototypically takes place at the business location ( hence `` work * * '' ) , though this is not a strict condition for using `` work * * ' ' the meaning of * * has been extended from the prototype .",
    "likewise , the pattern `` _ _ person _ _ \\ { * * , * * , * * } _ organization _ '' has been conventionalized to signify employment or similar institutional - belonging relationships .",
    "bipartite analysis equips us with the ability to use the existing labels like or to deal with the overloading of the label , instead of forcing a difficult decision or creating several additional categories .",
    "this analysis also accounts for similar construals presented by adpositions in other languages .",
    "for example , the overlap of with , as seen in english example [ ex : associate_from ] , occurs in hindi and korean as well .",
    "another source of difficulty in the original annotation came from caused - motion verbs like _ put _ , which takes a pp indicating part of a path .",
    "sometimes the preposition lexically marks a source or goal , e.g. , * * , * * , or * * [ ex : put_into ] .",
    "often , however , the preposition is prototypically locative , e.g. ,  * * or * * [ ex : put_on ] , though the object of the preposition is interpreted as a destination , equivalent to the use of * * or * * , respectively .",
    "this locative - as - destination construal is highly productive , so analyzing * * as polysemous between and does not capture the regularity .",
    "the pp is sometimes analyzed as a resultative phrase @xcite . in our terms",
    ", we simply say that the scene calls for a , but the preposition codes for a : thus , we avoid listing the preposition with multiple lexical functions for this regular phenomenon .",
    "the opposite problem occurs with fictive motion @xcite : a path pp , and sometimes a motion verb , construe a static scene as dynamic :    rather than forcing annotators to side with the dynamic construal effected by the language , versus the static nature of the actual scene , we represent both : the scene role is ( static ) and the preposition function is ( dynamic ) .",
    "the added representational complexity of the bipartite analysis seems justified to account for many of the phenomena discussed above , especially as the project grows to include more languages .",
    "but is the complexity worth it on balance ?",
    "we consider some of the tradeoffs below .",
    "we encountered several examples in which function labels are difficult to identify .",
    "consider the following paraphrases :    in [ ex : run - eso ] , `` schoolyard '' is accompanied by a postposition * * ( comparable to english * * ) , which marks it as the location of running .",
    "this is the unmarked choice . on the other hand , in sentence [ ex : run - ul ] ,",
    "the noun is paired with the accusative marker * * , the marked choice .",
    "the use of * * evokes a special construal : it indicates that the schoolyard is more than just a backdrop of the running act and that it is a location that cheolsu mindfully chose as the place of action .",
    "additionally , marking the location with the accusative marker , pragmatically , brings focus to the noun ( i.e. , he ran in a schoolyard as opposed to anywhere else ) .",
    "such construals are not limited to locations , but may also include other scene roles such as and , in alternation with postpositions that can express those functions . since accusative case markers generally serve syntactic functions over semantic ones , it may be difficult to identify a semantic function the accusative marker carries .    a similar phenomenon can be found in hindi :    this suggests that , apart from spatiotemporal relations and semantic roles , adpositions can mark * information structural * properties for which we would need a separate inventory of labels .",
    "in some idiomatic predicate ",
    "argument combinations , the semantic motivation for the preposition may not be clear [ ex : idiomatic ] . while the scene role in [ ex : listen_to ] and [ ex : proud_of ] is clearly , the function is less clear . is the object of attention construed ( metaphorically ) as a in [ ex : listen_to ] , and the cause for pride as a in [ ex : proud_of ] ? or are * * and * * semantically empty argument - markers for these predicates ( cf .",
    "the `` case prepositions '' of @xcite ) ?",
    "we do not treat either combination as an unanalyzable multiword expression because the ordinary meaning of the predicate is very much present .",
    "[ ex : unhappy_with ] and [ ex : interested_in ] are similarly fraught . but as we look at more data , we will entertain the possibility that the function can be null to indicate a marker which contributes no lexical semantics .",
    "annotators are generally capable of interpreting meaning in a given context .",
    "however , it might be difficult to train annotators to develop intuitions about adposition functions , which reflect prototypical meanings contributed by the lexical item that may not be literally applicable .",
    "these distinctions may be too subtle to annotate reliably .",
    "as we are approaching this project with the goal of producing annotated datasets for training and evaluating natural language understanding systems , it is an important concern .",
    "we are currently planning pilot annotation studies to ascertain ( i )  the prevalence of the role vs.  function mismatches , and ( ii )  annotator agreement on such instances . enshrining role ",
    "function pairs in the lexicon may facilitate inter - annotator consistency : our experience thus far is that annotators benefit greatly from examples illustrating the possible supersenses that can be assigned to a preposition .",
    "if initial pilots are successful , we would then need to decide whether to annotate the role and function together or in separate stages . because the function reflects one of the adposition s prototypical senses ,",
    "it may often be deterministic given the adposition and scene role , in which case we could focus annotators efforts on the scene roles .",
    "existing annotations for lexical resources such as propbank @xcite , verbnet @xcite , and framenet @xcite might go a long way toward disambiguating the scene role , limiting the effort required from annotators .      assuming the above theoretical and practical concerns are surmountable",
    ", annotated corpora would facilitate empirical studies of the nature and limits of adposition / case construal within and across languages .",
    "for example : is it the case that some of the supersense labels can only serve as scene roles , or only as functions ? (",
    "a hypothesis is that subtypes tend to be limited to scene roles , but this needs to be examined empirically . )",
    "which role ",
    "function pairs are attested in particular languages , and are any universal ? thus far we have seen that certain scene roles , such as , , and , invite many different adposition construals  is this universally true ? as adpositions are notoriously difficult for second language learners , would it help to explain which construals do and do not transfer from the first language to the second language ?",
    "the bipartite analysis may allow us to trade more complexity at the token level for less complexity in the label set . as discussed in [ sec : construal ] , separating the scene role and function levels of annotation will more adequately capture construal phenomena without forcing an arbitrary choice between two labels or introducing further complexity into the hierarchy .",
    "in fact , we hope to _ simplify _ our current supersense hierarchy , especially by removing labels with multiple inheritance for usages that can be accounted for with the bipartite analysis instead .",
    "candidates include ( inheriting from and ; e.g. , `` the fly flew * * zig - zags '' ) and ( inheriting from and ; e.g. , `` we traveled * * bus '' ) .",
    "we may also collapse the pairs / , / , and /.",
    "a simpler hierarchy of supersenses will serve to reduce the number of labels for annotators to consider during the annotation process and also help improve automatic methods by reducing sparsity of labels in the data .",
    "we have focused on developing a _ broad - coverage _ annotation scheme for adpositional semantics , and our proposal requires no more than two categorical labels per adposition token ( but see below ) .",
    "although our current approach falls short of a full constructional derivation of the form  meaning correspondences that comprise a sentence and the interpretation that results , we believe our approach could inform such an analysis .",
    "construction grammar formalisms that support full - sentence analyses include embodied construction grammar @xcite , fluid construction grammar @xcite , and sign - based construction grammar @xcite . without tying ourselves to any one of these ,",
    "we observe at a high level that the lexical semantic contribution of the adposition ( the function ) can be distinguished from the role of a governing predicate or scene by assigning these meanings to different stages of the derivation .",
    "e.g. , in `` care * * the strategy , '' the adposition and pp could express a figure - ground relation whose ground is the meaning of `` the strategy '' ; `` care '' could evoke a semantic frame with a role ; and an argument structure construction could link the ground of the figure - ground relation with the role . if the @xmath0 construal with * * is sufficiently productive , the generalization could be formalized via an argument - structure construction with a verb slot limited to verbs of ( say ) emotion and a pp headed by topical * * .",
    "there are complications which we are not yet prepared to fully address .",
    "first , if the pp is not governed by a predicate which provides the roles  such as a verb or eventive / relational noun  the preposition may need to evoke a meaning more specific than our labels .",
    "e.g. , for `` children * * pajamas '' and `` woman * * black , '' * * may be taken to evoke the semantics of wearing clothing .",
    "the label set we use for broad - coverage annotation is , of course , vaguer , and would simply specify for the clothing sense of * * .",
    "copular constructions raise similar issues .",
    "consider `` it is * * you to decide , '' meaning that deciding is the addressee s responsibility : this idiomatic sense of * * is closer to a semantic predicate than to a semantic role or figure - ground relation .    in rare instances ,",
    "we are tempted to annotate a chain of extensions from a prototypical function of a preposition , which we term * multiple construal*. for instance :    `` yelled * * '' in [ ex : yell_at ] is a communicative action whose addressee ( ) is also a target of the negative emotion ( @xmath0 : compare the use of * * in `` shoot * * the target '' ) .",
    "[ ex : angry_at ] is similar , except `` angry '' focuses on the emotion itself , which bob is understood to have evoked in his boss .",
    "with regard to [ ex : involved_in ] , the item `` involved * * '' has become fossilized , with * * marking an underspecified noncausal participant ( hence , as the scene role ) . at the same time",
    ", one can understand the * * here as motivated by the member - of - set sense ( cf .",
    "`` i am * * the group '' ) , which would be labeled @xmath0 because it conceptualizes membership in terms of containment .",
    "a similar logic would apply to `` people * * the company '' : @xmath0@xmath0 .",
    "effectively , the multiple construal analysis claims that multiple steps of extending a preposition s prototypical meaning remain conceptually available when understanding an instance of its use .",
    "that said , we are not convinced that this logic could be applied reliably by annotators , and thus may simplify the usages in [ ex : dbl ] to just the first and second or the first and third labels .",
    "finally , metaphoric scenes @xcite raise a whole host of issues . in [ ex : put_metaphor ] , the locative - as - destination construal ( [ sec : motion ] ) is layered with the states - are - locations metaphor . in bipartite analysis , we annotate the scene in terms of the governing predicate s * target domain * , and the adposition function in terms of the * source domain * : a constructional analysis could capture both source domains and both target domains  i.e .",
    ", , , , and perhaps by assigning source domain meanings to lexical constructions and target domain meanings to their mother phrases .",
    "we have considered the semantics of adpositions and case markers in english and a few other languages with the goal of revising a broad - coverage annotation scheme used in previous work .",
    "we pointed out situations where a single supersense did not fully characterize the interaction between the adposition and the scene elaborated by the pp . in an attempt to tease apart the semantics contributed specifically by the adposition from the semantics coming from elsewhere , we proposed a bipartite construal analysis .",
    "though many details remain to be worked out , we are optimistic that our bipartite analysis will ultimately improve broad - coverage annotations as well as constructional analyses of adposition behavior .",
    "we thank the rest of our carmls team  martha palmer , ken litkowski , katie conger , and meredith green  for participating in weekly discussions of adposition semantics ; michael ellsworth for an insightful perspective on construal , paul portner for a helpful clarification regarding approaches to conceptualization in the literature , and anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments ."

    "<S> we suggest a framework to represent both the scene role and the adposition s lexical function so they can be annotated at scale  supporting automatic , statistical processing of domain - general language  and sketch how this representation would inform a constructional analysis . </S>"
