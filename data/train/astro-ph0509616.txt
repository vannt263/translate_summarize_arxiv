    "substantial progress has been made over the last 5 years in high - redshift galaxy studies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the significant aspects of recent work carried out since that review are the rapid growth in the numbers of galaxies that populate the high - redshift end of the samples ( @xmath6 and above ) and the development of large , spectroscopically complete samples from wide - area surveys for a number of discrete fields ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these give a handle on the problem of cosmic variance , and also allow us to build up the large samples required for luminosity function studies .",
    "spectroscopic completeness makes it possible to estimate the star - forming population at high redshift , and its evolution . detailed examination and comparison of the strength and profile shape of the ly@xmath7 emission line",
    "may provide insights to possible changes in the underlying stellar population , or in the neutral hydrogen content of the surrounding intragalactic medium .",
    "the most successful method of identifying galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath8 , where galaxy continuua are faint against a strong nightsky background , is by using the redshifted ly@xmath7 emission line .",
    "the present surveys were were driven by the development of wide - field , red - sensitive instruments on the large telescopes : the half - degree fov suprimecam mosaic ccd imager ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the 8.3-m subaru telescope , and the wide - field ( @xmath9 ) deimos multi - slit spectrograph and imager on the keck ii 10-m telescope .",
    "narrowband imaging is used in combination with deep multicolor @xmath10 and moderate infrared @xmath11 imaging over the suprimecam fields to identify high - redshift galaxies with strong ly@xmath7 emission and continuum color breaks .",
    "current investigations use @xmath12bandpass filters centered at 8150  and 9130  ( ly@xmath7 at @xmath4 and @xmath1 ) for the narrowband studies , with follow - up deimos spectra ( 3.6  resolution , @xmath13 ) at keck .",
    "survey fields are chosen from half a dozen extensively studied fields : ssa22 , goods - n , lockman hole nw , ssa13 , ssa17 , and a370 . completed studies at @xmath4 for ssa22 ( @xcite ) show a high success rate in identifying and confirming candidates ( 19 confirmed of 22 observed ) , as well as success in discriminating against red stars and identifying / confirming t dwarf candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "a second @xmath0 study has been completed for the region including the hdf - n and goods - n fields ( @xcite ) . at present",
    "62 confirmed redshifts at @xmath0 are in hand for 3 fields , with 14 confirmed @xmath3 redshifts ( extending to @xmath14 ) for 3 fields",
    ".     - wide narrowband nb816 filter ( for ly@xmath7 emission at @xmath4 ) using the suprimecam mosaic ccd camera on subaru .",
    "the narrowband images in the survey are comparable in depth to the hdf , and each field center surveys a region 70 times larger than the area shown here , with good image quality . wide area coverage and image depth",
    "are required to identify and study the high - redshift samples.,width=499 ]    at magnitudes brighter than @xmath15 the number density of such high - redshift galaxies is only a few hundred per square degree and the distribution is highly correlated on sub - degree scales ( e.g. , capak 2004 ) . a combination of depth and area coverage is needed for these studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : hdf_nb_comp ] shows the depth and image quality of the survey s suprimecam narrowband exposures compared to deep hdf continuum images .",
    "no @xmath0 galaxies are found in the survey within the hdf - n . over the larger",
    "acs goods - n field ( still a sub - region of the suprimecam field ) only 6 @xmath0 galaxies were found . and none of the @xmath3 sources were found within the region of acs goods - n .",
    "with the high - redshift samples in hand , we can construct luminosity functions at @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and compare these to results at lower redshifts .",
    "the most direct comparison is to use the uv continuum luminosities of the ly@xmath7-selected samples and compare these with luminosity functions of the lyman - break galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) at redshifts @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( figure  [ fig : uvlum ] ) .",
    "this avoids problems of estimating possible dust contamination on the emission line . here",
    "the main uncertainty is how to correct the raw counts for the fractional population with strong ly@xmath7 emission . if the estimate of @xcite based on the lbgs at @xmath18 with strong ly@xmath7 is used to assume that the ly@xmath7 emitters represent only 20% of the star - forming galaxy population at @xmath0 , then the raw numbers for ly@xmath7-selected galaxies ( _ filled boxes _ )",
    "are corrected upwards to the _ open boxes _ that overlie the @xmath16 and @xmath17 lyman break galaxy uv continuum luminosity functions , implying there has not been a substantial decrease in the star formation rate out to redshift @xmath0 .    for the @xmath3 sample the longest wavelength deep continuum band ( @xmath19 around 9200  ) spans the wavelength of ly@xmath7 emission , making it difficult to estimate the line - free ultraviolet continuum . here , we compare the ly@xmath7 luminosity function with the luminosity function of the emission line obtained in narrowband samples at @xmath20 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lalum ] .",
    "the @xmath21 points are plotted with _",
    "open boxes _ and the @xmath4 points are shown with _ filled boxes_.",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the limits of the sample , which does not reach the flat part of the @xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "the _ filled box and upper limit drawn with heavy bars _ represent the points for the @xmath3 luminosity function and overlie the @xmath0 luminosity function data .",
    "the points are consistent with no marked change in the luminosity function between @xmath0 and @xmath3 as suggested by @xcite , who used a likelihood analysis to merge disparate data samples with varying degrees of incompleteness to compare the two redshift samples .",
    "the advantage of the present results lies in the larger and homogeneous samples , and the completeness of identifications .",
    "if reionization occurred at redshifts lower than @xmath22 we should see a major change in the equivalent widths of the lyman alpha emission line between the @xmath22 sample and the @xmath23 sample since the damping wings of the neutral gas should scatter much of the redward wing of the lyman alpha lines at the higher redshifts where the intergalactic gas is neutral .",
    "we can examine the emission - line profiles in the two samples .",
    "figure  [ fig : z5z6comp ] shows that the ly@xmath7 profiles , which have been stacked to improve our sensitivity , are extremely similar . both profiles show the strong blue asymmetry due to the ly@xmath7 forest that is characteristic of the very high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the profiles have similar equivalent widths and shapes .",
    "does this provide clear evidence that the epoch of reionization must lie at higher redshifts ?",
    "not necessarily . for ly@xmath7-emitting galaxies that are sufficiently luminous , self - clearing can complicate their effectiveness as a probe of the surrounding neutral igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) . even for lower luminosity objects , clustered distributions or neighboring objects may ionize the local region .",
    "the @xmath1 samples are still relatively small , and show a surprising amount of field - to - field variation , with 10 of the identified systems coming from the a370 field  coincidentally , the first field with a discovered @xmath24 galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "preferred ( low density ) lines of sight could be ionized , and there can be selection biases in our @xmath1 sample .",
    "the properties could reflect large - scale structure effects or a porous reionization boundary in both the profile and luminosity function analyses .",
    "the @xmath0 spectroscopic samples ( @xcite , @xcite ) with near - complete coverage in the ssa22 and hdf - n suprimecam fields provided the first quantitative demonstration of the existence of structured kinematic and redshift structures on large scales ( @xmath5 mpc co - moving distance ) at these redshifts . the long diagonal filament in _",
    "right panel _ of figure  [ fig : structure ] makes up a distinct redshift system with ly@xmath7 emission falling in the bottom quarter of the filter .",
    "such features are also seen in maps of the hdf - n .",
    "similar structured distribution at @xmath4 has recently been reported by @xcite for the subaru xmm deep field .",
    "we are now able to obtain large samples of @xmath0 and @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "the continuum and ly@xmath7 luminosity functions seem to be similar to those at lower redshifts , indicating a strong contribution to to the ionization of the igm from star - formation at these redshifts . both the ly@xmath7 luminosity function and the ly@xmath25 line shapes are similar at @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "large scale structure revealed in the distribution of these high - redshift galaxies leads us to the exciting conclusion that we may be able to make 3-dimensional maps of the cosmic web at these redshifts !",
