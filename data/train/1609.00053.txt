    "the process by which a signal is transformed , in order to significantly reduce is dimensionality , is refereed to as sparse representation of the signal . for the class of signals known as compressible , such as images and audio signals , this process can be realized without much loss of information content .",
    "the degree of the achieved sparsity depends on the suitability of the transformation for representing the particular signal .",
    "traditional methods implement the transformation using fast orthogonal transforms .",
    "however , much higher levels of sparsity are attained , in many cases , if the transformation is carried out using a large redundant set called dictionary .",
    "the gain comes at expenses of increment in complexity .",
    "however , advances in computational facilities , including multiprocessors for personal computers , have encouraged the developments of techniques for signal representation using dictionaries . for the most part",
    "these techniques comprise strategies based on minimization of the @xmath0-norm @xcite and the so called ` greedy strategies ' .",
    "the latter consist in adaptively constructing a signal representation as a linear superposition of elements taken from the dictionary . in this communication",
    "we focus on a low memory implementation of a particular method within this category .",
    "greedy strategies have been the subject of much research in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "the simplest , yet very effective greedy algorithm for the sparse representation of large signals , was introduced to the signal processing community in @xcite with the name of matching pursuit ( mp ) .",
    "it had previously appeared as a regression technique in statistics though @xcite , where the convergence property was established @xcite .",
    "while mp converges asymptotically to a signal in the linear span of the dictionary , or to its orthogonal projection if the signal is out of that space , the approach is not stepwise optimal because it does not yield an orthogonal projection at each step . consequently , in addition to failing to minimize the norm of the approximation error at each step , it may select linearly dependent elements . as will be illustrated by the example of sec .",
    "[ spmp ] , this feature significantly compromises sparsity in some cases . the performance of the seminal mp approach has also been shown to be poor for the recovery of some exactly sparse signals @xcite .    a refinement to mp , which does yield an orthogonal projection at each iteration , is refereed to as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite .",
    "this is a very effective technique up to some dimensionality .",
    "when processing large signals , however , the storage requirements of its standard implementations frequently exceed the memory capacity of a personal computer used for research purposes . some techniques addressing this matter",
    "are known as gradient pursuits @xcite .",
    "the methods in this line produce a satisfactory approximation of the omp criterion in many practical situations .",
    "however , as shown by the example of sec .",
    "[ spmp ] , such an approximation may not be satisfactory in cases where the basic mp method performs badly .",
    "an alternative implementation of omp , which requires much less memory than standard implementations , is considered in @xcite .",
    "the approach is termed self projected matching pursuit ( spmp ) , because it produces the orthogonal projection of the signal , at each iteration , by applying mp using a dictionary consisting only of the already selected elements .",
    "real world signals are too large to be approximated using dictionaries . often the approximation is carried out by dividing the signal into small units ( or ` blocks ' ) , constructing what we call a ` signal partition ' .",
    "even so , the memory requirements of standard implementations of omp limit the size of the blocks in the partition .",
    "since the memory demands of spmp are of the same order as mp , this implementation extends the limit of applicability of the omp refinement as far as memory is concerned .",
    "the spmp implementation has been shown to be affective for sparse approximation of astronomical images @xcite .",
    "the convenient feature in that context being that spmp fully exploits the separability of dictionaries . in the case of one dimensional signals such as melodic music , which are well approximated by trigonometric dictionaries , the spmp approach allows to implement omp without having to save the dictionary and performs the calculation via the fast fourier transform @xcite .",
    "whilst the approximation of a signal partition is often realized by approximating every element of the partition completely independently of the others , in some cases of interest much higher levels of sparsity can be achieved if the approximation of all the blocks in the partition are related by a global constraint on sparsity .",
    "this gives rise to what is termed the hierarchized block wise ( hbw ) implementation of greedy strategies for approximating by partitioning @xcite .",
    "in particular , the hbw versions of the mp / omp algorithms is refereed to as hbw - mp / omp .",
    "even when the hbw - omp approach is implemented on partition units of relatively small size , for which the standard omp implementations would not introduce any memory issue , its storage requirements are much more demanding .",
    "this limits the size of the signals that can be approximated by the hbw - omp strategy without segmentation .",
    "contrarily , the hbw - spmp implementation of the same approach provides us with a suitable alternative for dealing with large signals .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are listed below :    * the paper presents the convergence analysis of the spmp approach , which deals with those cases where the standard implementations of the omp approach is not feasible due to storage requirements . *",
    "the hbw - spmp implementation of the hbw - omp method is introduced .",
    "its advantage upon the standard implementation which would approximate each element of the partition at once , and totally independently of the other elements , is illustrated by a)producing high quality sparse approximation of music signals using simple trigonometric dictionaries and b)producing high quality sparse approximation of x - ray medical images . *",
    "the hbw backward spmp strategy , for downgrading the decomposition of a signal , is considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ spmp ] revises the spmp method and proofs the exponential convergence of the self projection step .",
    "[ hbwspmp ] extends the spmp method by introducing its hbw version for approximating a signal partition subjected to a global constraint on sparsity .",

    "this lemma is just a particular case of the well established and more general convergence properties of mp @xcite .",
    "however , for pedagogical reasons , due to its crucial importance for this work , we present here a particular proof holding for finite dimension spaces which , for this reason , is very simple and transparent .",
    "we notice , from , that @xmath39 is a decreasing sequence which , since @xmath40 for all @xmath24 , is bounded .",

    "this result is readily obtainable here , because of the finite dimension framework .",
    "indeed , in finite dimension any set of vectors is a frame for its linear span .",
    "hence the existence of a reciprocal frame @xmath50 of the dictionary @xmath18 is guaranteed .",

    "this implies that the outputs of the algorithm are theoretically equivalent to those of omp .",
    "[ lem2 ] if the atoms @xmath83 are selected by criterion , and the residue refined by self projections at each iteration , the selected atoms constitutes a linearly independent set .",

    "it is concluded then that @xmath31 can not be expressed as a linear combination of the previously selected atoms .",
    "we start by recalling some properties of hermitian matrices , which will be used for the analysis .",

    "@xcite it is true that @xmath116 .",
    "hence , in general one could expect the convergence rate of the self projection to slow down as the iterative selection of atoms progresses .",
    "* remark 1 : * the exponential convergence of mp in terms of the dictionary s coherence is derived in @xcite for the case of quasi incoherent dictionaries .",
    "that condition is too stringent for signals of practical interest , which are far more compressible when using a highly coherent dictionaries than when using an orthogonal or quasi orthogonal basis .",
    "contrarily , the expression gives a realistic appreciation of the broad range of effective applicability of the spmp approach .",
    "regardless of the dictionary coherence , spmp can be an effective low memory implemtation of omp as long as the least square problem , for the determination of the coefficients in the atomic decomposition of each @xmath117 , is not an ill well posed problem .",

    "now , setting @xmath128 the dictionary @xmath126 is no longer an orthonormal basis but a redundant tight frame and the algorithms mp and omp produce very different decompositions .",
    "while omp improves the sparsity of the representation requiring only @xmath129 components , mp needs @xmath130 different atoms , i.e. significantly more than with the orthonormal basis .",
    "the reason for the poor performance of mp is that in the redundant dictionary the atoms are highly correlated and the method picks linearly dependent atoms .",
    "when applying the proposed refinement , spmp , the number of required components is the same as with omp , i.e. @xmath129 .",

    "afterwards we reduce the coefficients of the approximation by ranking the blocks for the downgrading through the hbw - bspmp approach , so us to attain a global snr of 35db . as observed in fig .",
    "[ srb1 ] the sr results are similar to those obtained by applying the hbw - spmp method up to a snr=35db .",
    "[ srb2 ] shows the sr obtained by the same strategy as in fig .",
    "[ srb1 ] , but in this case the spmp approach is applied to approximate each of the images in fig .  [ x - ray ] up to psnr=48db .",
    "the hbw - bspmp method is next applied to downgrade that approximation up to psnr=47db .",
    "these numerical examples show that , even within a mild reduction of quality , downgrading in a hbw fashion can significantly improve upon a forward independent approximation of the partition units ( c.f . figs .",
    "[ sr1 ] and [ sr2 ] ) .         + * note : * the matlab functions implementing the methods , as well as the signals used in the numerical examples , have been made available on @xcite .",
    "the exponential convergence of the spmp algorithm , which implements the omp approach by means of the mp one , was derived .",
    "the orthogonal projection step , intrinsic to the omp method , is realized within the spmp framework by approximating the residual error using the mp algorithm and a dictionary consisting only of the already selected atoms , up to the particular step .",
    "thus , the memory requirements are kept within the same scale as for mp .",
    "the bound for the self projection convergence rate ( c.f . ) clearly highlights the broad range of cases for which implementing omp through spmp is effective . since the convergence rate depends on the minimum eigenvalue of the gram matrix constructed with the selected atoms , the cases for which the convergence could become very slow fall within the rage of ill posed problems .",
    "a particularly convenient feature of spmp , when applied for approximating two dimensional images , is that it fully exploits the separability of a dictionaries .",
    "the hbw extension of a pursuit strategy for approximating a signal partition also benefits from the reduction in memory requirements .",
    "the hbw version of spmp was introduced and illustrated by approximating two clips of music and two x - ray medical images . in these cases ,",
    "the convenience of the hbw manner for approximating a partition is highlighted by the numerical results .",
    "the advantage of the popular way of approximating a signal partition ( i.e. realizing the approximation of each unit totally independent of each other ) is recognized with regards to the possibility of straightforward parallelization using multi - processors .",
    "hence , the hbw - bspmp technique for downgrading a given atomic decomposition was introduced .",
    "the relevance of this approach is strengthen by the fact that it can refine , in an effective manner , any given approximation , regardless of the method by which that approximation was obtained .",
