    "the homogenization approximation fails when @xmath53 becomes as large as @xmath49 , or equivalently when the extrinsic fluctuations ( measured by the size of their standard deviation ) become as large as the mean concentration .",

    "we have investigated a model transport problem that incorporates both intrinsic noise associated with the underlying stochastic hopping process , and extrinsic disorder arising from variability in sink strengths .",
    "the former generates independent fluctuations in site occupancies , represented by a diagonal covariance matrix , typical of a zrp .",
    "the latter generates long - range perturbations that can be correlated across the entire domain .",
    "we examined the case in which multiple sinks are distributed sparsely across the domain , allowing continuum multiscale approximations to be adopted . while it is natural to predict mean site occupancies using the ensemble - averaged sink strength ( represented by the leading - order homogenized solution @xmath49 )",
    ", we found this to be a biased estimator of the true ensemble mean .",
    "this is because a locally elevated [ diminished ] sink strength leads to global reduction [ increase ] in concentration , including at the sink itself .",
    "this in turn leads to a net reduction in the average local uptake rate @xmath72 ( represented by @xmath73 in ( [ eqn : cbar_eqn ] ) ) .",
    "the homogenized solution therefore overestimates the uptake rate when there is variability in sink strength , and therefore underestimates the mean site occupancy .",
    "we used stochastic homogenization to derive explicit predictions of the fluctuations arising from weak sink disorder , and validated the predicted covariance against simulations .",
    "the transport process has three competing physical effects ",
    "diffusion , advection , and uptake  and a relatively complicated interplay between these effects is observed .",
    "the convergence of the homogenization approximation to the ensemble mean is parameter - dependent , weakening with increasing mean sink strength ; i.e.  with increasing @xmath39 in fig .",

    "we anticipate that individual realisations will deviate significantly from the ensemble average , making the system non - self - averaging in this parameter regime",

    "returning to one of our motivating problems , for oxygen transport in a placental subunit ( a placentone ) , the pclet number has been estimated to be of order @xmath77 to @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "taking the domain length @xmath2 to be comparable to the path length ( @xmath79 ) from a spiral artery to a draining decidual vein , this implies @xmath80 , a regime in which advection dominates at the microscale .",

    "intrinsic noise due to small particle numbers can be expected to be negligible ; however the influence of fluctuations in the flow field induced by the irregular geometry may be significant @xcite and will be addressed elsewhere . an alternative application for which intrinsic and extrinsic noise may be of comparable importance concerns the motion of inhaled nanoparticles ( such as viruses or drugs ) through the mucus lining of a lung airway @xcite : here predominantly diffusive transport",
    "may be mediated by trapping of particles by large mucin molecules .",
    "while the present model describes a limited number of features of such applications , it provides a framework for describing the magnitude , structure and influence of fluctuations .",
    "the problem we have addressed has a number of obvious extensions , including spatially correlated or more densely distributed sinks , random sink locations , nonlinear kinetics and nonlinear hopping rates , higher spatial dimensions , etc .",
    "these extensions can be adapted to study specific applications in natural systems involving transport in the presence of spatial disorder .",
    "of particular significance in terms of predictive modelling is understanding the nature and magnitude of the bias in the homogenization prediction .",
    "the present approach is a weak disorder expansion ( see ( [ eq : largesigma ] ) ) that allows the physical system to be described as a gaussian process with slowly varying mean and spatial covariance . while this approach has wide applicability as a method of uncertainty quantification ,",
