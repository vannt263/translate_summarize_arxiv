    "generally , turbulence in a classical fluid [ called classical turbulence ( ct ) ] apparently seems to be very disordered and complex , but it is known to exhibit some characteristic statistical laws .",
    "one of the most famous laws in ct is the kolmogrov @xmath2 power law , which is confirmed by the many numerical and experimental studies in fully developed isotropic turbulence @xcite .",
    "quantum turbulence ( qt ) , which is a turbulent state realized in a quantum fluid , has been studied in superfluid helium for a long time @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of qt in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has been an active area of research @xcite .",
    "some numerical studies of qt in atomic becs have confirmed the kolmogorov @xmath2 power law in the spectrum of the incompressible kinetic energy @xcite , which shows the analogy between ct and qt .",
    "however , there are some differences between ct and qt , an example of which is the velocity distribution @xcite . in qt , a quantized vortex with discrete circulation exists , making the velocity distribution different from the vortex in ct because the structure of the vortex core in quantum fluids is considerably different from that in classical ones .",
    "thus , ct and qt exhibit both universal statistical laws independent of the details of the system and statistical laws characteristic of the system .    in atomic becs",
    ", there exist multicomponent becs with internal degrees of freedom that exhibit novel properties not seen in scalar becs @xcite .",
    "recently , hydrodynamics in binary becs based on the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations has been actively investigated , and various hydrodynamical instabilities , such as rayleigh - taylor , kelvin - helmholtz , and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities , have been studied @xcite . as another multicomponent system",
    ", spinor becs are realized ; these have spin degrees of freedom and exhibit behavior characteristic of spins @xcite . as with binary becs",
    ", some authors have studied the hydrodynamics in spinor becs @xcite , discussing spin dynamics such as the dynamical instability of the spin helical structure , the growth of the spin domains , and so on .",

    "novel turbulence not seen in scalar becs can be realized ; this turbulence is expected to exhibit two types of statistical laws : a statistical law characteristic of the system and universal ones independent of the details of the system .",

    "we have previously performed theoretical and numerical studies of spin turbulence ( st ) in spin-1 spinor becs with a ferromagnetic ( fm ) interaction , where the spin density vector spatially points in various directions @xcite . in st , we focused on the spectrum of the spin - dependent interaction energy , finding theoretically and numerically the @xmath1 power law . in ct and qt",

    "these studies of st were performed in the spin-1 spinor bec with a fm interaction , but we have not investigated st with an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interaction in detail ; in such a case the spin magnitude is small .",
    "this st is expected to exhibit behavior much different from st with a fm interaction .    in this paper , we report the characteristic properties of st with small spin magnitude in spin-1 spinor becs that arises because of the counterflow instability @xcite . this kind of st is obtained when the spin - dependent interaction is afm or a static magnetic field is applied to the system with a fm interaction . in the former case ,",
    "the spin magnitude obviously becomes small because of the afm interaction . in the latter case ,",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect reduces the magnitude of the spin density vector . in such st",
    ", we find that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws can appear in the low- and high - wave - number regions by using a kolmogorov - type dimensional scaling analysis for the equations of motion of the spin vector and the nematic tensor .",

    "( [ spin continuity])([nematic current ] ) .",
    "further , even if there are vortices , the velocity can be comparable to the sound velocity only near the vortex core , which means that the vortices do not affect the spectrum in the wave number region lower than @xmath61 corresponding to the spin coherence length @xmath62 . in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we used the same approximations .",
    "the third approximation is that the magnitude of the spin vector is smaller than unity .",
    "this is valid in a system with an afm interaction or a fm interaction under a static magnetic field because the afm interaction or the quadratic zeeman effect reduces the magnitude of the spin vector .",

    "has been discussed @xcite . in this system ,",
    "direct enstrophy and inverse energy cascades occur , where the @xmath142 and @xmath2 power laws are expected in the kinetic energy spectra @xcite . however , this interaction is nonlocal in the inertial range , which leads to a logarithmic correction to the @xmath142 power law @xcite .",
    "recently , the localness in the kelvin wave cascade has been discussed @xcite .",
    "thus , the configuration of the spectrum is affected by the localness of the interaction .    in our st , we must investigate whether the interaction is local , but we do not understand the localness in st because the hydrodynamic equations of the spin-1 spinor gp equation is complex . this problem remains the future work .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the influence of the magnetic field on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws . in sec .",
    "iv b , we applied a static magnetic field to a system with a fm interaction , where the spin magnitude becomes small and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws appear .",
    "however , these power laws can be affected by the strength of the magnetic field .    in sec .",
    "iv b , the terms generating the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws are a few times larger than the quadratic zeeman term by an order estimation .",
    "thus , although the quadratic zeeman term is neglected in the scaling analysis , it is not small , which may change these power laws .",
    "the quadratic zeeman term has no spatial derivative , which means that the term can affect the spectrum in a wave number region smaller than @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the order of the sum @xmath145 of the nematic tensor .",
    "this is obtained by an order estimation between the kinetic and quadratic zeeman terms in eq .",
    "( [ spin continuity ] ) or ( [ nematic continuity ] ) .",
    "if the quadratic zeeman effect is dominant , the effect must appear in the wave number region lower than @xmath146 .",
    "however , the spectrum clearly exhibits the @xmath0 power law there in fig . [ fig6](c ) .",
    "therefore , the zeeman effect in sec .",
    "iv b seems too small to affect the appearance of the @xmath0 power law .",
    "let us consider the magnetic field smaller than that in the case of sec .",
    "iv b. then , the magnitude of the spin vector is larger than that in sec .",
    "iv b because of the small quadratic zeeman effect .",
    "this leads to a deviation from the @xmath0 power law , which is confirmed by our numerical calculation .",
    "thus , we can not obtain a clear @xmath0 power law when the magnetic field is extremely small .",
    "the details of the influence of the magnetic field on st will be studied in a future work .",
    "we have studied st with small spin magnitude in a spin-1 spinor bec in a uniform system by using the spin-1 spinor gp equations .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws in the low- ( @xmath136 ) and high- ( @xmath135 ) wave - number regions are derived by a kolmogorov - type dimensional scaling analysis .",
    "we perform numerical calculations for a two - dimensional uniform system that show that st with an afm interaction exhibits the @xmath1 power law , but the spectrum deviates from the @xmath0 power law in the low - wave - number region .",
    "however , in a system with a fm interaction under a static magnetic field , both power laws are confirmed clearly .    finally , we comment on the possibility of experimental observation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 power laws .",
    "we expect that these power laws can be observed in experiments with @xmath147 @xmath148rb ( fm interaction ) under a static magnetic field if the system size is much larger than @xmath149 .",
    "this type of experiment may be feasible because there are currently some experiments with @xmath148rb in which magnetic fields are applied and spin density vectors can be observed @xcite .",
    "however , in experiments with @xmath147 @xmath150na ( afm interaction ) @xcite , it may be difficult to observe these power laws because our numerical calculation does not obtain the clear @xmath0 power law in st with an afm interaction .",
