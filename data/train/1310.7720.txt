    "monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite ( tmdcs ) posses a number of remarkable electrical and optical properties , which makes them an attractive research platform .",
    "their material composition can be described by the formula @xmath2 , where @xmath3 or @xmath4 and @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "they are atomically thin , two - dimensional materials , and in contrast to graphene@xcite , they have a finite direct optical band gap of @xmath7 , which is in the visible frequency range@xcite .",
    "this has facilitated the theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite study of the rich physics related to the coupling of the spin and the valley degrees of freedom .",
    "very recently , there has also been a growing interest in the transport properties of these materials .",
    "although contacting and gating monolayer tmdcs is not entirely straightforward experimentally , progress is being made in this respect@xcite .",
    "electric@xcite and magnetic field@xcite effects are also studied currently , both in monolayer and few - layer samples . in addition , a promising experimental work has recently appeared regarding spin - physics in these materials , showing , e.g. , a viable method for spin - injection from ferromagnetic contacts@xcite .",
    "the finite band gap in the tmdcs should also make it possible to confine the charge carriers with external gates and therefore to create , e.g. , quantum dots .",
    "together with the above mentioned progress in contacting and gating tmdcs , this raises the exciting question of whether these materials could be suitable platforms to host qubits @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by this question .",
    "first , we are going to introduce an effective hamiltonian which accurately describes the physics in the conduction band ( cb ) of tmdcs in the ( degenerate ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 valleys of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "we confine our attention to the cb while the effect of the valence band ( vb ) and other relevant bands are taken into account through an appropriate choice of the parameters appearing in the model .",
    "this approach is motivated by the facts that i ) the band - gap energy @xmath10 is large with respect to other energy scales appearing in the problem , and ii ) according to experimental observations , the samples of tmdcs are often intrinsically @xmath11-doped@xcite or show unipolar @xmath11-type behavior@xcite . to obtain realistic values of the parameters appearing in the theory",
    "we have performed density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we discuss the important effects of the intrinsic soc which manifest themselves both through the spin - splitting of the cb and the different effective masses associated with the spin - split bands .",
    "we also point out that a perpendicular magnetic field , in addition to the usual orbital effect , leads to the breaking of valley degeneracy .",
    "moreover , due to the strong soc , the coupling of the spin degree of freedom to the magnetic field is described by an out - of - plane effective @xmath0-factor @xmath12 .",
    "we then study the effect of an external electric field and derive the bychkov - rashba soc hamiltonian for tmdcs .",
    "this is motivated by recent experiments@xcite , where strong electric fields were created by back gates to study the charged excitons .",
    "in particular , we find that in contrast to iii - v semiconductors and graphene , due to the lower symmetry of the system , the bychkov - rashba soc hamiltonian contains two terms , one of which has not yet been discussed in the literature . using perturbation theory and first - principles ( fp ) calculations , we can estimate the magnitude of this effect for each tmdc material .    finally , we consider qds obtained by confining the charge carriers with gate electrodes .",
    "we study the dependence of the spectrum of such qds on a perpendicularly applied external magnetic field .",
    "we show that while pure spin and pure valley qubits are possible , e.g. , in small qds in @xmath13 , but they require large magnetic fields because of the relatively strong intrinsic soc in the cb . on the other hand , combined spin - valley qubits represented by a kramers pair can be operated at small magnetic fields .",
    "qds in nanowires consisting of a @xmath13 nanoribbon with armchair edges or crystallographically aligned confining gates have been recently discussed @xcite .",
    "our proposal does not require atomically sharp boundaries or a precise control of the placement of the confining gates ; therefore it should be easier to fabricate experimentally .",
    "moreover , we explicitly take into account the intrinsic spin - splitting of the cb .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_ham ] we derive an effective hamiltonian describing electrons in the cb .",
    "we take into account the effects of perpendicular external electric and magnetic fields . using the results of fp calculations we obtain values for the important parameters appearing in our model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we use this model to study the magnetic field dependence of the bound states in a qd .",
    "we also discuss the possible types of qubits that qds in tmdcs can host .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] . in appendices",
    "[ sec : sevenband ] and [ sec : eff - ham - details ] we present the details of the derivation of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we collect some useful formulas in appendix [ sec : alpha - eigenfunc ] and the details of our dft calculations can be found in appendix [ sec : comp - detail ] .",
    "we consider a monolayer tmdc and introduce a low - energy effective hamiltonian which captures the most important effects in the spin - split conduction band at the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) point .",
    "the detailed derivation of the model , which is based on a seven - band ( without the spin degree of freedom ) @xmath14 hamiltonian , is presented in appendix [ sec : sevenband ] .",
    "it is important to note that , as pointed out in refs .",
    ", there are several band extrema in the band structure of tmdcs which can be of importance : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mos2-bandstruct ] , where we show the band structure of @xmath13 obtained from dft calculations .",
    "since we assume that the system is n - doped , the maximum at the @xmath15 point of the vb is not relevant . more important",
    "are the secondary minima in the cb , which are usually called the @xmath16 ( a.k.a .",
    "@xmath17 ) points . the exact alignment of the @xmath16 point energy minimum with respect to the @xmath8 point minimum is difficult to deduce from dft and @xmath18 calculations , because it depends quite sensitively on the details of these computations@xcite .",
    "we have found that using the local density approximation ( lda ) , all compounds , with the exception of @xmath13 , become indirect gap semiconductors if we take into account the soc , because the @xmath16 point minimum is lower than the @xmath8 point minimum .",
    "more advanced @xmath18 calculations also give somewhat conflicting results and are quite sensitive to the level of theory@xcite ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 etc , ) and the lattice constant used .",
    "experimentally , monolayer tmdcs show a significant increase of photoluminescence@xcite with respect to few - layer or bulk tmdcs , which is usually interpreted as evidence that they are direct gap semiconductors .",
    "therefore we assume that for low densities it is enough to consider only the @xmath8 and @xmath9 points of the cb .",
    "for the formation of qds from states around the @xmath8 point , the safest material appears to be @xmath13 , where the secondary minima are most likely above the @xmath8 point minimum by a few hundred mev@xcite .",
    "however , for operation at low temperatures , the other tmdcs may also be suitable , as long as the @xmath16 point lies a few mev higher than the @xmath8 points . in cases where the @xmath16 point lies below the @xmath8 point",
    ", one can envisage qds formed within the @xmath16 valley , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .      due to the absence of a center of inversion and strong soc , the bands of monolayer tmdc materials are spin - split everywhere in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , except at the high - symmetry points @xmath15 and @xmath21 , where the bands remain degenerate .",
    "in addition , the projection of the spin onto the quantization axis perpendicular to the plane of the monolayer is also preserved .",
    "this is a consequence of another symmetry , namely , the presence of a horizontal mirror plane @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , a suitable basis to describe the cb is given by the eigenstates @xmath23 , @xmath24 of the dimensionless spin pauli matrix @xmath25 with eigenvalues @xmath26 .",
    "in what follows , we will often use the shorthand notation @xmath23 for @xmath27 and @xmath24 for @xmath28 .    in the absence of external magnetic and electric fields ,",
    "the effective low - energy hamiltonian which describes the spin - split cb at the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) point in the basis @xmath29 is @xmath30 here , we introduce the inverse effective mass @xmath31 , where @xmath32 for @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and the wavenumbers @xmath33 are measured from the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) point . leaving the discussion of the effects of magnetic field to sec .",
    "[ subsec : magnetic_field ] , we set @xmath34 and therefore the dispersion described by the hamiltonian ( [ kp - and - intr - so ] ) is parabolic and isotropic .",
    "the trigonal warping@xcite , which is much more pronounced in the vb than in the cb , is neglected here .",
    "the strong spin - orbit coupling in tmdcs has two consequences : firstly , as already mentioned , the cb is spin - split at the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) point and this is described by the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "secondly , the effective mass is different for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands .",
    "our sign convention for the effective mass assumes that the spin - up band is heavier than the spin - down band at the @xmath8 point ( for details on the effective mass calculations see appendix [ sec : eff - ham - details ] ) .",
    "the effective mass @xmath36 of different tmdcs , obtained from fitting the dft band structure@xcite , is shown in table [ tbl : effmass_and_so ] ( note that @xmath37 ) .",
    "as one can see , the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is around @xmath40 for @xmath13 and @xmath41 , while it is @xmath42 for the @xmath43 compounds . in the seven - band @xmath14 model",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the effective mass depends on the ratio of the spin splittings in other bands ( most importantly , in the vb and the second band above the cb ) and the band gap @xmath10 .",
    "for the heavier compounds the spin - splittings are larger , but @xmath10 remains roughly the same or even decreases , leading to a larger difference in the effective masses .",
    "the matrix elements of the momentum operator @xmath45 and the hamiltonian describing the perpendicular electric field were evaluated within the lda using the castep code@xcite , because the necessary plane - wave coefficients of the kohn - sham orbitals at the band edges were readily accessible in the output of castep .",
    "we used norm - conserving pseudopotentials , a plane - wave cutoff energy of 2177ev , an artificial periodicity of 15.9   in the vertical direction and a @xmath46 monkhorst - pack mesh .",
    "the optimized lattice parameters were similar to those found in the vasp calculations .",
