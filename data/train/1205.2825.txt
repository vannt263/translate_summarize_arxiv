    "humans and other animals often show cooperation in social dilemma situations , in which defection apparently seems more lucrative than cooperation .",
    "a main mechanism governing cooperation in such situations is direct reciprocity , in which the same pairs of players repeatedly interact to realize mutual cooperation @xcite . in fact , individuals who do not repeatedly interact also cooperate with others . in this",
    "situation , reputation - based indirect reciprocity , also known as downstream reciprocity , is a viable mechanism for cooperation @xcite . in this mechanism , which i refer to as indirect reciprocity for simplicity , individuals carry their own reputation scores , which represent an evaluation of their past actions toward others .",
    "individuals are motivated to cooperate to gain good reputations so that they are helped by others in the future or to reward ( punish ) good ( bad ) others .",
    "indirect reciprocity facilitates cooperation in a larger population than in the case of direct reciprocity because unacquainted players can cooperate with each other .",
    "although evidence of indirect reciprocity is relatively scarce for nonhumans ( but see @xcite ) , it is widely accepted as explanation for cooperation in humans @xcite .",
    "humans , in particular , belong to groups identified by traits , such as age , ethnicity , and culture .",
    "individuals presumably interact more frequently with ingroup than outgroup members .",
    "group structure has been a main topic of research in social psychology and sociology for many decades @xcite and in network science @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that , when the population of players has group structure , two phenomena that are not captured by existing models of indirect reciprocity take place .",
    "first , in group - structured populations , humans @xcite and even insect larvae @xcite show various forms of ingroup favoritism . in social dilemma games",
    ", individuals behave more cooperatively toward ingroup than outgroup members ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ingroup favoritism in social dilemma situations may occur as a result of indirect reciprocity confined in the group @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ingroup favoritism in social dilemma games is not pareto efficient because individuals would receive larger payoffs if they also cooperated across groups . under",
    "what conditions are ingroup favoritism and intergroup cooperation sustained by indirect reciprocity ?",
    "can they bistable ?",
    "ingroup favoritism , which has also been analyzed in the context of tag - based cooperation , the green beard effect , and the armpit effect , has been considered to be a theoretical challenge ( e.g. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , recent research has revealed their mechanisms , including the loose coupling of altruistic trait and tag in inheritance @xcite , a relatively fast mutation that simultaneously changes strategy and tag @xcite , a tag s relatively fast mutation as compared to the strategy s mutation @xcite , conflicts between groups @xcite , partial knowledge of others strategies @xcite , and gene - culture coevolution @xcite .",
    "however , indirect reciprocity accounts for ingroup favoritism , as is relevant to previous experiments @xcite is lacking .",
    "second , in a population with group structure , individuals tend to approximate outgroup individuals characteristics by a single value attached to the group . this type of stereotype is known as outgroup homogeneity in social psychology @xcite , and it posits that outgroup members tend to be regarded to resemble each other more than they actually do .",
    "it is also reasonable from the viewpoint of cognitive burden of remembering each individual s properties that humans generally resort to outgroup homogeneity .",
    "therefore , in indirect reciprocity games in group structured populations , it seems to be natural to assume outgroup homogeneity . in other words",
    ", individuals may not care about or have access to personal reputations of those in different groups and approximate an outgroup individual s reputation by a group reputation .",
    "some previous models analyzed the situations in which players do not have access to individuals reputations .",
    "this is simply because it may be difficult for an individual in a large population to separately keep track of other people s reputations even if gossiping helps dissemination of information .",
    "this case of incomplete information has been theoretically modeled by introducing the probability that an individual sees others reputations in each interaction @xcite . however , these studies do not have to do with the approximation of individuals personal reputations by group reputations .    by analyzing a model of an indirect reciprocity game based on group reputation",
    ", i provide an indirect reciprocity account for ingroup favoritism for the first time .",
    "in addition , through an exhaustive search , i identify all the different types of stable homogeneous populations that yield full cooperation ( intragroup and intergroup cooperation ) or ingroup favoritism .",
    "i assume that the population is composed of infinitely many groups each of which is of infinite size .",
    "each player belongs to one group .",
    "players are involved in a series of the donation game , which is essentially a type of prisoner s dilemma game . in each round , a donor and recipient are selected from the population in a completely random manner .",
    "each player is equally likely to be selected as donor or recipient .",
    "the donor may refer to the recipient s reputation and select one of the two actions , cooperation ( c ) or defection ( d ) .",
    "if the donor cooperates , the donor pays cost @xmath0 , and the recipient receives benefit @xmath1 . if the donor defects , the payoffs to the donor and recipient are equal to 0 . because the roles are asymmetric in a single game , the present game differs from the one - shot or standard iterated versions of the prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "this game is widely used for studying mechanisms for cooperation including indirect reciprocity @xcite .",
    "rounds are repeated a sufficient number of times with different pairs of donors and recipients .",
    "because the population is infinite , no pair of players meets more than once , thereby avoiding the possibility of direct reciprocity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the payoff to each player is defined as the average payoff per round .",
    "the groups to which the donor and recipient belong are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the simultaneously selected donor and recipient belong to the same group with probability @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath5 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]a ) and different groups with probability @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath7 ; fig .  [ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]b ) .      at the end of each round , observers assign binary reputations , good ( g ) or bad ( b ) , to the donor and donor s group ( @xmath2 ) according to a given social norm .",
    "i consider up to so - called second - order social norms with which the observers assign g or b as a function of the donor s action and the reputation ( i.e. , g or b ) of the recipient or recipient s group ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "representative second - order social norms are shown in fig .",

    "simple standing ( `` standing '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : norms ] ) , and stern judging ( `` judging '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : norms ] ; also known as kandori ) enable full cooperation @xcite .",
    "shunning also enables full cooperation if the players reputations are initially c and the number of rounds is finite @xcite or if the players reputations are partially invisible @xcite .    in the presence of group structure , four possible locations of the observer",

    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers ] .",
    "i call the observer belonging to @xmath2 an `` ingroup '' observer .",
    "otherwise , the observer is called an `` outgroup '' observer .",
    "the observers can adopt different social norms for the four cases , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers ] . when the donor and recipient belong to the same group ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]a ) , the ingroup observer uses the norm denoted by @xmath8 to update the donor s personal reputation .",
    "in this situation , the outgroup observer does not update the donor s or @xmath2 s reputation ( but see appendix  [ sec : appendix variant ] ) .",
    "when the donor and recipient belong to different groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]b ) , the ingroup observer uses the norm denoted by @xmath9 to update the donor s personal reputation .",
    "in this situation , the outgroup observer uses the norm denoted by @xmath10 to update @xmath2 s reputation .",
    "these four cases are explained in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sub : update ] .",
    "the distinction between @xmath8 and @xmath9 allows the ingroup observer to use a double standard for assessing donors .",
    "for example , a donor defecting against an ingroup g recipient may be regarded to be b , whereas a defection against an outgroup g recipient may be regarded as g. such different assessments would not be allowed if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not distinguished .",
    "i call @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 subnorms .",
    "all the players are assumed to share the subnorms .",
    "the typical norms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : norms ] can be used as subnorms .",
    "a subnorm is specified by assigning g or b to each combination of the donor s action ( i.e. , c or d ) and recipient s reputation ( i.e. , g or b ) .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath11 subnorms .",
    "an entire social norm of a population consists of a combination of the three subnorms , and there are @xmath12 social norms .",
    "the action rule refers to the mapping from the recipient s reputation ( i.e. , g or b ) to the donor s action ( i.e. , c or d ) . the allc and alld donors cooperate and defect , respectively , regardless of the recipient s reputation . a discriminator ( disc ) donor cooperates or defects when the recipient s reputation is g or b , respectively .",
    "an anti - discriminator ( antidisc ) donor cooperates or defects when the recipient s reputation is b or g , respectively .",
    "the donor is allowed to use different action rules toward ingroup and outgroup recipients .",
    "for example , a donor who adopts allc and alld toward ingroup and outgroup recipients , respectively , implements reputation - independent ingroup favoritism .",
    "there are @xmath13 action rules .",
    "a donor refers to the recipient s personal reputation when @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]a ) and to @xmath3 s group reputation when @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]b ) .      in each round ,",

    "an outgroup observer in this situation is assumed not to update @xmath2 s reputation because such an observer does not know the recipient s personal reputation , although the donor does .",
    "then , the outgroup observer may want to refrain from evaluating the donor because the donor and the observer use different information about the recipient .",
    "i also analyzed a variant of the model in which the outgroup observer updates @xmath2 s reputation in this situation .",
    "the results are roughly the same as those obtained for the original model ( appendix  [ sec : appendix variant ] ) .",
    "if @xmath7 , the donor is assumed to recognize @xmath3 s reputation , but not the recipient s personal reputation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ingroup outgroup observers]b ) .",
    "an ingroup observer in this situation updates the donor s personal reputation on the basis of the donor s action , @xmath3 s reputation , and subnorm @xmath9 .",
    "both the donor and observer refer to @xmath3 s reputation and not to the recipient s personal reputation .",
    "an outgroup observer in this situation updates @xmath2 s reputation based on the donor s action , @xmath3 s reputation , and subnorm @xmath10 .",
    "an outgroup observer knows the recipient s personal reputation if the observer and recipient are in the same group .",
    "however , the observer is assumed to ignore this information for two reasons .",
    "first , it is evident for the observer that the donor does not have access to the recipient s personal reputation . to explain the second reason ,",
    "let us consider an outgroup observer who belongs to @xmath3 in a certain round .",
    "assume that this observer assigns a new reputation to @xmath2 according to a subnorm different from one used when the observer does not belong to @xmath3 .",
    "the same observer does not belong to @xmath3 when the observer updates the @xmath2 s group reputation next time .",
    "this is because the probability that the observer belongs to @xmath3 is infinitesimally small because of the assumption of infinite groups .",
    "therefore , the subnorm used when the observer belongs to @xmath3 is rarely used and immaterial in the present model .    finally , observers commit reputation assessment error . with probability @xmath16 , ingroup and outgroup",
    "observers independently assign the reputation opposite to the intended one to the donor and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "i introduce this error because g and b players must coexist in the population to distinguish the payoff values for different pairs of action rule and social norm ( action  norm pair ) ; such a distinction is necessary for the stability analysis in the following discussion . for simplicity ,",
    "i neglect other types of error .      to examine the stability of an action rule under a given social norm , i consider two types of mutants .",
    "the first is a single mutant that invades a group .",
    "there are @xmath17 types of single mutants",
    ". a single mutant does not affect the action rule , norm , or reputation of the group that the mutant belongs to because of the assumption of infinite group size .",

    "a homogeneous group composed of mutants may make the mutant type stronger than the resident type .",

    "[ sub : scenario 1 ] ) . in general",
    ", different mechanisms of cooperation can be understood in an unified manner such that cooperation occurs if and only if @xmath116 is larger than a threshold value @xcite .",

    "the present result also fits this view ; @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath117 in the case of kin selection .",
    "i assumed that players approximate personal reputations of individuals in other groups by group reputations ( i.e. , outgroup homogeneity ) .",
    "adoption of outgroup homogeneity may be evolutionarily beneficial for players owing to the reduction in the cognitive burden of recognizing others personal reputations .",

    ", one has to examine competition between players using the group reputation and players not using it .",
    "it would also be necessary to introduce a parameter representing the cost of obtaining personal reputations of outgroup individuals .",
    "such an analysis is warranted for future work .",
    "all the players are assumed to use the same social norm .",
    "this assumption may be justified for well - mixed populations but less so for populations with group structure because group structure implies relatively little intergroup communication .",

    "the possibility of heterogeneous social norms , analyzing a population composed of a small number of groups , probably by different methods , would be helpful .",
    "indirect reciprocity based on group reputation is distinct from any type of group selection .",
    "this is true for both full cooperation and ingroup favoritism .",
    "there are two dominant variants of group selection that serve as mechanisms for cooperation in social dilemma games @xcite .",
    "the first type is group competition , in which selection pressure acts on groups such that a group with a large mean payoff would replace one with a small mean payoff .",
    "models with group competition induce ingroup favoritism @xcite , altruistic punishment @xcite , and evolution of the judging social norm in the standard game of indirect reciprocity whereby players interact within each group @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the present study is not concerned with evolutionary dynamics including group competition .",
    "the group mutant is assumed to statically compare the payoff to the resident group with that to the mutant group .",
    "the second type of group selection requires assortative reproduction in the sense that the offspring have a higher probability of belonging to specific groups than to other groups depending on the offspring s genotype .",
    "it is mathematically identical with kin selection @xcite .",
    "this variant of group selection is also irrelevant to the present model , which is not concerned with the reproduction process .",
    "the analysis in this study is purely static .",
    "i avoided examining evolutionary dynamics for two reasons .",
    "first , the discovered mechanism for cooperation may be confused with group selection in the presence of evolutionary dynamics .",
    "second , the model becomes needlessly complicated .",
    "introducing evolutionary dynamics implies that one specifies a rule for reproduction .",
    "offspring may be assumed to belong to the parent s group or to migrate to another group .",
    "it may then be necessary to consider the treatment of , for example , the heterogeneous group size . because evolutionary dynamics are neglected",
    ", the present model explains neither emergence of full cooperation and ingroup favoritism nor the likelihood of different solutions , which is a main limitation of the present study .",
    "i stress that the concept of group mutants is introduced to sift the set of stable action ",
    "norm pairs .",
    "unless group competition is assumed , the concept of group mutants does not particularly promote cooperation in evolutionary dynamics .      under a proper social norm , full",
    "cooperation or ingroup favoritism is stable if @xmath115 ( i.e. , eq .",
    "is satisfied ) in most cases . with probability @xmath118 ,",

    ", @xmath119 is quite often the condition for cooperation , where @xmath120 is the probability that the recipient s reputation is observed .",
    "this holds true when @xmath120 indicates the observation probability for the donor @xcite or that for both the donor and observer @xcite . because @xmath4 is also equal to the probability that the donor sees the recipient s personal reputation",

    "the consistency between eq .",
    "and @xmath119 implies that the concept of group reputation does not increase the maximum population size for which indirect reciprocity occurs .",
    "however , under group competition ( sec .",
    "[ sub : group selection ] ) , full cooperation and ingroup favoritism can be stable even if the restriction imposed by eq .",
    "is removed .",
    "to explain this point , assume that the population is subjected to evolutionary dynamics such that players with relatively large payoffs would bear more offspring in the same group and group competition occurs .",
    "the rate of group competition is denoted by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the mean time interval between successive group competition events .",

    "is violated , single mutants emerge in time @xmath126 .",
    "then , some types of mutants , including the alld mutant , spread in the invaded group in time @xmath127 under scenario 1 of group mutation .",
    "the invaded group presumably possesses a smaller group - averaged payoff than other resident groups because the resident population is stable against invasion by group mutants as long as @xmath93 , in all but three of 270 action  norm pairs ( table  [ tab : condition partial ingroup favoritism ] ) . if @xmath128 , such an invaded group is likely to be eradicated by group competition because group competition occurs much faster than the emergence of single mutants . in this case , full cooperation or ingroup favoritism , depending on the given social norm , can be maintained in the absence of eq .  .",

    "the amount of punishment is larger for an ingroup donor s defection than an outgroup donor s defection @xcite .",
    "my results are consistent with their results in that , for ingroup favoritism , the donor s action must be seriously evaluated by the ingroup observer using @xmath8 and not seriously by the outgroup observer using @xmath10 .",

    "therefore , advising players to change their behavior toward outgroup recipients from alld to disc is not recommended unless the social norm is also altered .",
    "conversion from ingroup favoritism to full cooperation requires a change in the social norm such that players as observers seriously assess ingroup donors actions toward outgroup recipients ( with @xmath130 ) and outgroup  outgroup interaction ( with @xmath10 ) . in particular ,",

    "the coincidence of only two subnorms is insufficient to induce full cooperation ( sec .",

    "<S> i assume that players approximate outgroup members personal reputations by a single reputation value attached to the group . </S>",
    "<S> i show that ingroup favoritism and full cooperation are stable under different social norms ( i.e. , rules for assigning reputations ) such that they do not coexist in a single model . if players are forced to consistently use the same social norm for assessing different types of interactions ( i.e. , ingroup versus outgroup interactions ) , only full cooperation survives . </S>",
    "<S> the discovered mechanism is distinct from any form of group selection . </S>",
    "<S> the results also suggest potential methods for reducing ingroup bias to shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism to full cooperation . </S>"
