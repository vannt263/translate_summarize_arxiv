    "<S> we discuss the concept of measurement in cosmology from the relativistic and quantum mechanical points of view . the uncertainty principle within the particle horizon , </S>",
    "<S> excludes the momentum of particles to be less than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect modifies the standard thermodynamics of early universe for the ultra - relativistic particles such that the equation of state as well as dependence of energy density and pressure to the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this modification to the thermodynamics of early universe is important for energies @xmath1 . during the inflation , </S>",
    "<S> the particle horizon inflates to a huge size and makes the uncertainty in the momentum to be negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of measurement is the basis of two main theories of physics , relativity and quantum mechanics . at the present universe where the cosmological scales are too large and energy density of cosmological fluid is too low </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement can be treated classically . however , for the early universe with higher energies and smaller scales , using quantum mechanical concept in the measurement is essential . </S>",
    "<S> + as we know from the basis of quantum mechanics , if we confine a particle inside a box , an uncertainty due to this confinement appears in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> a well known example is the scattering of the particles from the slit , where the confinement of the position causes uncertainty in the momentum , resulting the formation of the scattering pattern . </S>",
    "<S> analogue to a particle inside a box , in the case of the early universe we have a causal box ( i.e. particle horizon ) which any observer in the universe is confined to do his / her measurements within this scale @xcite . in another word </S>",
    "<S> considering a wave function to a particle , the probability of finding a particle by an observed outside its horizon is zero , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> + from the theory of relativity , measurement of a stick length can be done by sending simultaneous signals to the observer from the two endpoints , where for the scales larger than the causal size , those signals need more than the age of the universe to be received . looking back to the history of the universe , the particle horizon after the planck era grows as @xmath3 but inflates to a huge size by the beginning of inflationary epoch @xcite . in the pre - inflationary epoch the maximum uncertainty in the location of a particle @xmath3 results in a minimum uncertainty in the momentum as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter . + </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty can also be described by an experiment similar to the heisenberg gedanken microscope . using photons with small wavelengths to probe the position of a particle makes larger uncertainty in the momentum . to minimize this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we have to use photons as large as possible wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> however photons with the wavelengths larger than the particle horizon are not detectable . </S>",
    "<S> the horizon size wavelength photons are the weakest accessible probe , producing a minimum uncertainty of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as we go back further to the planck epoch the size of particle horizon becomes smaller and consequently the uncertainly in momentum raises . </S>",
    "<S> + for the ultra - relativistic particles the minimum uncertainty of energy in three spatial dimensions is @xmath7 . to have a feeling from the amount of uncertainty in the energy we compare it with the thermal energy through @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this ratio grows as we go further to the early universe . in the planck epoch @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so these two energies tend to the same order of magnitude . </S>",
