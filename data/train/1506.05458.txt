    "the notion of low - energy universality in particle - particle collisions is a powerful concept that has been around , in one form or another , for a very long time .",
    "the general idea consists of replacing realistic , complicated interactions with much simpler ones and renormalising their bare coupling constants in favour of exact ( either experimental or theoretical ) scattering properties .",
    "the model interaction , irrelevant at the two - body level , can then be used to investigate the effect of interactions with higher particle numbers without the extra complications of the realistic interactions .",
    "for example , in 1957 , huang and yang introduced their s - wave regularised pseudopotential @xcite , which aimed at reproducing the exact scattering length of a realistic two - body process by means of a very simple model interaction .",
    "the idea , however , was put forward much earlier by fermi in the 1930s @xcite , who studied neutron - nucleon scattering , and was able to fit the scattering length in the first born approximation .",
    "the calculation of two - body scattering properties with rather realistic two - body interactions , if these are spin - independent , spherically symmetric , and single - channel , is not too complicated , especially with the computers we have access to nowadays .",
    "it is genuine multichannel collisions that can become quite challenging to approach directly from the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation . in nuclear physics",
    ", there is a fundamental interest in obtaining nucleon - nucleon scattering properties from first principles using lattice qcd ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in condensed matter and cold atomic physics , particle - particle scattering theory in a crystal , where the incident waves are bloch waves , and with a realistic ( e.g. screened coulomb ) interaction , constitutes a formidable problem : all bands of the periodic potential are coupled by the interaction , galilean relativity does not hold so that the collisional properties depend on the total center of mass momentum , and spherical symmetry is not present and can not be exploited .    in situations like those described above ,",
    "it is of great appeal to be able to extract scattering properties without having to directly use scattering theory . in massive quantum field theories ,",
    "lscher showed how to extract partial - wave scattering amplitudes , i.e. phase shifts and scattering lengths , from the energy shifts due to the interactions when the system is placed in a finite volume @xcite , thereby generalising an older result from non - relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , neither lscher s nor huang - yang s results for the scattering lengths hold when these are unnaturally large , i.e. near the unitary limit .",
    "this problem was elegantly solved using pionless effective field theory @xcite by beane _",
    ". @xcite . in this way ,",
    "an analysis of low - energy nucleon - nucleon collisions , directly from qcd , was possible soon after @xcite . in the case of particle - particle scattering in a crystal ,",
    "finite - size effects in the forms given in refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ", however , do not appear to be known . in this article",
    "we derive the relevant formulas from effective field theory on a tight - binding lattice , that is , the hubbard model .",
    "we will focus on the three - dimensional ( space ) case , for the one - dimensional case is well understood @xcite and lscher s formula in one dimension @xcite holds .",
    "we derive the pertinent expressions using bethe - goldstone equations , and we begin by proving these via the introduction of a more general class of methods consisting of kernel subtractions .",
    "we then introduce the hubbard model and analyse , in first instance , its nave continuum limit .",
    "we then return to the hubbard model itself and show that , at low energy and large volume , the energy shifts are completely analogous to those obtained from the nave continuum limit , which shows once more how low - energy physics , at least in the two - particle case , is universal .",
    "for general interactions , one way of establishing the relation between the scattering states of a system ( i.e. the positive energy states in the infinite size limit ) and the energy shifts in a finite box is to use bethe - goldstone ( bg ) theory @xcite in vacuum , that is , without the static fermi sea background .",
    "in fact , even if it looks very different from it , lscher rederived , and used the exact same old bethe - goldstone s equation in his seminal paper @xcite . here",
    "we will relate bg theory to a much more general method ",
    "kernel subtractions  for solving homogeneous integral equations , and show that it corresponds to a particular choice of kernel subtraction .",
    "the method is easy to implement .",
    "let @xmath0 be the solution to the integral equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the kernel ( operator ) , with @xmath3 some parameter , which in the relevant case here will correspond to an energy eigenvalue .",
    "the above equation ( [ homo ] ) is homogeneous and therefore only has a solution for particular values of @xmath3 .",

    "we shall focus on one specific model , namely the hubbard model on a simple cubic lattice .",

    "before studying the hubbard model in detail , it is very instructive to consider its nave continuum limit . the bare continuum hamiltonian is given by @xmath43 above , @xmath44 is the effective mass , @xmath45 is the bare interaction strength , and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the fermionic annihilation ( creation ) operator in the continuum .    the above hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ continuumhamiltonian ] ) , is obtained as follows .",
    "firstly , we restore the lattice spacing @xmath48 ( which was set to @xmath49 in the previous section ) , in such a way that the action of the non - interacting hamiltonian on a single - particle wave function , in the first quantisation , is given by @xmath50,\\label{h0psi}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , and where we have defined the unit vectors @xmath53 such that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the continuum limit of the bare interaction strength is attained by identifying @xmath57 as @xmath58 .    the effective interaction in eq .",
    "( [ continuumhamiltonian ] ) is a zero - range `` s - wave '' interaction .",
    "it is renormalisable , and accounts correctly for the s - wave scattering length with a vanishing effective range .",
    "this interaction can be renormalised in a number of ways , all equivalent to each other .",
    "for instance , minimal subtraction in the hard cutoff regularisation scheme @xcite , dimensional regularisation , huang s pseudopotential @xcite , or the more recent method of tan s distributions @xcite , all give the same results .",
    "in all the aforementioned methods , spherical symmetry of the contact interaction is exploited .",
    "the question arises of whether the cubic symmetry of the lattice brillouin zone in the continuum limit changes the status of affairs .",
    "the answer to this question , which seems quite trivial , is not straightforward at all . on the one hand ,",
    "the scattering properties at low energies remain unchanged . on the other hand",
    ", lscher s formula heavily relies on spherical symmetry , a fact which is particularly evident in the pionless eft considered by beane _",
    "@xcite , and we will show that lscher s formula _ does _ change significantly when the lattice symmetry is respected in the regularisation process , unless special care is taken in the renormalisation process .      in this subsection , we shall obtain the reaction matrix ( @xmath59-matrix ) , by regularising the contact interaction in such a way that the symmetry of the brillouin zone is manifestly preserved at all steps . the regularised contact interaction @xmath60 in the momentum representation for a spin - singlet fermion pair with ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath61 is therefore given by @xmath62 where we have defined @xmath63 above , @xmath64 is the heaviside step function .",

    "the @xmath59-matrix at arbitrary energy is renormalisable if @xmath75 is finite for all energies @xmath3 , that is , if the linearly divergent part of the integrals @xmath70 is energy - independent . to show that this is indeed the case , write the integral @xmath70 as @xmath76 the second integral on the right hand side of eq .",
