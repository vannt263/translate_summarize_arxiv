    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) approximation in field theory is the approximation with the effective 4 - fermion interaction @xcite .",
    "it allows to understand qualitatively formation of fermion condensates in various physical systems @xcite from superconductivity and superfluidity @xcite to top quark condensation @xcite .",
    "any njl model is the non - renormalizable low energy approximation to the microscopic theory .",
    "therefore , its predictions depend strongly on the way it is regularized . in many publications on njl models",
    "the ordinary cutoff regularization was assumed , in which the cutoff @xmath8 is present in all loop integrals . in most of such papers",
    "physical quantities are evaluated in one - loop approximation ( i.e. in the leading order in @xmath9 expansion ) .",
    "the higher loops were simply disregarded .",
    "the examples are the njl approximation to qcd @xcite , technicolor @xcite , the papers on the models of top quark condensation ( tc ) @xcite , on the extended technicolor ( etc ) @xcite , on the topcolor assisted technicolor @xcite , on the top - seesaw @xcite .",
    "the use of the one - loop approximation may cause a confusion because formally the contributions of higher loops to various physical quantities are strong .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the next to leading ( ntl ) order approximation to the fermion mass @xmath10 is weak compared to the one - loop approximation only if @xmath11 .",
    "it follows from analytical results and from numerical simulations made within the lattice regularization @xcite ( in which lattice spacing is related to the cutoff as @xmath12 ) that the dimensional physical quantities in the relativistic njl models are typically of the order of the cutoff unless their small values are protected by symmetry . as a result , strictly speaking , the one - loop approximation to the njl model in cutoff regularization may give a more or less reasonable contribution to the physical quantities only if those quantities are of the order of the cutoff .",
    "this is the case of qcd and conventional technicolor .    at the same time , for example , in the case of the models of top - quark condensation , top seesaw , and etc , formally the one - loop results can not be used because the cutoff is assumed to be many orders of magnitude larger than the generated fermion mass .",
    "that means , that in order to use the one - loop results in the mentioned cases in the njl model with cutoff regularization we should start from the action of the model with the additional counter - terms .",
    "if these counter - terms cancel quadratic divergences in the next to leading orders of @xmath9 expansion , then this expansion may be applied and , in particular , the one - loop results give reasonable estimates to the physical quantities .",
    "such a redefined njl model is actually equivalent to the original njl model defined in zeta or dimensional regularization .",
    "the four fermion coupling constants of the two regularizations are related by the finite renormalization ( see @xcite , appendix , sect . 4.2 . ) .",
    "the njl models in zeta regularization were considered , for example , in @xcite . the njl model in dimensional regularization",
    "was considered in @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that there is the exchange by massive gauge bosons behind the njl models of top quark condensation , top seesaw , and etc .",
    "if so , the appearance of the one - loop gap equation of njl model should follow from the direct investigation of the theory with massive gauge fields interacting with fermions .",
    "the obvious difficulty for establishing this result is related to the fact , that chiral symmetry breaking in the considered theory may appear to be a strong coupling effect .",
    "( indeed this will be explicitly demonstrated in the present paper . )",
    "the applicability of various analytical methods to the investigation of strongly coupled theories is limited .",
    "actually , all results that may be obtained here are to be verified by direct lattice numerical simulations .",
    "nevertheless , there exist the analytical methods , which were applied successfully to certain strongly coupled theories , although without the rigorous proof that this may be done .",
    "one of such methods is the use of truncated schwinger - dyson equation ( for the review see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation with the kernel that corresponds to the single exchange by massive gauge boson and bare interaction vertex . for the consideration of this problem for the massless @xmath13 gauge bosons see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "the output of that study is the prediction that there may exist the phase transition in qed at a rather strong value of coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath15 the theory may appear to be in the phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the value of dynamical fermion mass @xmath7 should be related to the only massive parameter existing in the theory that is the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "the relation between them is given by the so - called miransky scaling @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of the phase transition has been confirmed later by lattice numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "however , in compact lattice qed this is the first order phase transition @xcite . in non - compact formulation",
    "@xcite the lattice study indicates the second order phase transition but the above scaling has not been confirmed @xcite . unlike the more complicated models the analysis of qed is exhaustive .",
    "the output of this study is that schwinger - dyson equation in landau gauge indeed gives reasonable qualitative pattern of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , its quantitative predictions should be taken with care .",
    "the similar problem has been studied in massive electrodynamics using schwinger - dyson equation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "later this approach was used as a building block for the construction of the theories with dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite . however , the gauge different from the landau gauge was used , and the kernels of the equations are so complicated that their direct analysis was not performed . instead",
    ", the kernels were substituted by some approximating expressions without strong justification .",
    "besides , the wave function renormalization function @xmath18 was taken equal to unity as for the massless case although the corresponding kernel does not vanish .",
    "the output and method of @xcite is , in general , similar to that of the study of pure qed of @xcite .",
    "however , the approximations used require the re - check using another technique .",
    "this will be done in the present paper .",
    "we shall explore dyson - schwinger equation in landau gauge , and use the kernels as they are .",
    "the result for the critical coupling constant is , in principle , similar to that of @xcite . in the massive gauge theory there",
    "exists the finite dimensional parameter - the gauge boson mass @xmath5 .",
    "it should be related with the dynamical fermion mass @xmath7 .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equation in landau gauge does not contain ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we assume , that the gauge boson becomes massive because of the interaction with the ( possibly , composite ) scalar field .",
    "this scalar field is condensed , and gauge boson mass appears as a result of higgs mechanism . in this pattern",
    "the finite ultraviolet cutoff @xmath19 appears that marks the scale at which the fluctuations of the mentioned scalar field wash out the gauge boson mass .",
    "we shall derive gap equation near to the criticality ( which has not been not done in @xcite ) and observe , that its form coincides _ exactly _ with the one loop gap equation of the nambu - jona - lasinio model with the suitable definition of the four - fermion coupling constant and the cutoff of the order of the gauge boson mass .",
    "we present our results in the form that is valid for a wide variety of gauge groups and fermion representations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the numerical lattice study of the system with massive gauge bosons coupled to fermions has been performed both in the case of @xmath13 gauge group and @xmath20 gauge group . in both cases",
    "there are the indications of the continuous phase transition . in case of @xmath13 gauge theory @xcite the evidence is given that the model may indeed be approximated at strong enough values of gauge coupling constant by the the effective one - loop njl model understood through the one - loop results . however , in this case ( see @xcite and references therein ) the formal continuum limit is , most likely non - interacting because of the landau pole . in the @xmath20 case ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) the continuum limit of the lattice model has not been investigated and , therefore , the value of continuum critical coupling constant has not been calculated .",
    "also the question of the possibility to approximate the model by the one - loop njl results has not been investigated .",
    "let us consider the system of fermion @xmath21 and scalar @xmath22 coupled to gauge field @xmath23 ( with the field strength @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 belongs to the group @xmath26 .",

    "`` angular '' modes of the field @xmath22 are eaten by the gauge bosons while the `` radial '' modes are massive with mass matrix @xmath32 that depends on the details of @xmath30 .",
    "at the energies much smaller than the eigenvalues of @xmath32 we arrive at the effective action : @xmath33 notice , that this effective action may be valid up to the energies much larger than @xmath5 if all eigenvalues of @xmath32 are sufficiently large .",

    "it is worth mentioning that our results may easily be generalized to the wide class of gauge groups and fermion representations . in practise ,",

    "anyway , the ladder dyson - schwinger equation itself is a rough approximation to the whole theory .",
    "we expect that our analysis gives the correct qualitative pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking in the given system , and more or less reasonable approximation for the dependence of the dynamical fermion mass on @xmath271 .",

    "the calculated values of critical coupling constant and the constant @xmath176 of eq .",

    "actually , the appearance of such a cutoff is very natural .",
    "it may be understood if we take into account that in the original renormalizable gauge theory the value of running coupling constant @xmath272 depends on momentum .",

    "this results effectively in the appearance of the ultraviolet cutoff in our expressions .",
    "we assume , that @xmath19 .    at not very large values of the ratio @xmath237 the dyson - schwinger equation",
    "predicts the second order phase transition of the njl type between the symmetric and the broken phases .",
    "parameter @xmath176 of eq .",
    "( [ gapeqs ] ) grows when this ratio is increased .",
    "that means that the strength of the phase transition is increased .",
    "formally , at the infinite value of @xmath237 we already do not have the second order phase transition because infinitely small variation of the coupling constant near its critical value causes the finite change of dynamical mass .",
    "this indicates that in the complete theory the second order phase transition may become the first order phase transition at finite but sufficiently large ratio @xmath237 .",
    "the model considered in the present paper is to a certain extent similar to that of @xcite , where the system with exchange by massless gauge bosons was considered in the presence of infrared cutoff .",
    "this infrared cutoff plays the role similar to the role of vector boson mass in our model .",
    "namely , when coupling constant @xmath4 is just above the critical value @xmath240 , the solution of dyson - schwinger equation with nonzero but small dynamical mass of the fermion appears .",
    "when @xmath4 is increased further , the mass of the first solution is increased , and just above a certain value @xmath276 the second solution appears , etc .",
    "only the solution with the largest value of mass is stable .",
    "the other solutions correspond to unstable vacua . however , those solutions are in one - to one correspondence with the resonances in the pseudoscalar channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect the appearance of such resonances in our case as well . in the case of massless gauge bosons",
    "these resonances are light ( their masses are of the order of the fermion mass ) , and , therefore , they may become light in our case as well .",
    "however , examination of this hypothesis requires analytical investigation of bethe - salpeter equations and/or lattice numerical simulations , and is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the weak coupling expansion does not work near to the critical value of @xmath4 because this critical value multiplied by @xmath183 is not small .",
    "however , our observation that this product remains of the order of unity matches the thooft condition necessary for the application of large @xmath277 expansion in gauge theory @xcite @xmath278 direct application of the large @xmath277 expansion in gauge theory is a rather complicated task .",
    "however , in qcd typically the large @xmath277 expansion is applied to the effective models @xcite .",
    "we suppose , that the same may be done in our case as well .",
    "we dealt with two approximations : the one defined by ladder schwinger - dyson equation , and the njl approximation .",
    "the relation between the two has been discussed above . in the njl model",
    "the @xmath9 expansion is a reasonable approximation , and , actually , is the only one that may be successfully applied .",
    "the problem with the next to leading order contributions mentioned in the introduction , most likely , is not relevant here . because the phase transition is likely of the second order ( that is confirmed by the direct lattice investigation for the case of @xmath20 and @xmath13 groups @xcite )",
    ", the dynamical fermion mass near to the phase transition is much smaller than the mass of vector boson .",
    "this may occur in njl model _ only _ if it is defined with the additional counter - terms that cancel quadratic divergencies in the next - to leading order expressions ( or , equivalently , is defined in zeta / dimensional regularization with suitably redefined four - fermion coupling , - see again the discussion in introduction ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose , that the actual njl approximation to the considered theory is of this type , and the @xmath9 expansion works in it as a result .",
    "this is in accordance with the observation that in the original renormalizable theory given by the action of eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) the thooft condition eq .",
    "( [ thoft ] ) is satisfied near to the criticality .",
    "the important feature of the njl model that was not considered here is the nambu sum rule @xcite that relates the values of masses of scalar excitations with the value of dynamical fermion mass . in our case",
    "this sum rule gives for the higgs boson @xmath279 .",
    "the confirmation of this expression would become the additional justification of the hypothesis that the njl model of eq .",
    "( [ njl02 ] ) approximates the model of eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "partially , this work has been done already in the series of papers on bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations and on the light front dynamics of bound states in gauge theory .",
    "actually , the works on light front dynamics indeed confirm the relation @xmath280 @xcite in the system with the exchange by massive vector bosons near to the criticality .",
    "we are aware of the investigations in the approach with bs equations only for the case @xmath97 ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , where this relation is confirmed as well .    finally , we would like to notice the possible application of the obtained results to the construction of various models of composite higgs bosons . at the present moment such models are developed actively and in many cases they are based on various versions of njl model .",
    "however , the problems with the njl models defined in conventional cutoff regularization that were mentioned in the introduction make many of such constructions questionalble . in fact , most of the physicists working on this subject have in mind that there is a renormalizable theory behind the njl model , that improves it considerably .",
    "the present work demonstrates that indeed the massive gauge theory with the working scale @xmath281 and the gauge boson mass @xmath5 may stand behind the effective low energy njl model that gives rise to dynamical fermion mass @xmath282 .",
    "the dangerous quadratic divergences of such effective njl model are , presumably , cancelled by the high energy renormalizable gauge theory , which allows to consider seriously the njl approximation with the four - fermion interactions . actually , the justification of the use of njl approximation was the starting point of the present investigation .",
