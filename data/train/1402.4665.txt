    "subsequently , the strips are always penetrated asymmetrically from the inner edges . specifically , when the applied field is raised beyond the first penetration field , vortices start to populate the innermost strip(s ) through the respective edges , while all other strips are still free of flux . under further increase of @xmath3 ,",

    "in summary , we have investigated the magnetic response of ( two ) aligned superconducting strips subject to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the penetration of vortices in these systems is dominated by a macroscopic energy barrier , the so - called geometrical barrier .",
    "we have found that a narrow slit between the strips completely suppresses this geometrical barrier as manifested in an early field penetration and the collapse of the hysteretic magnetization loop .",
    "we have compared the results for a pair of rectangular ( platelet shaped ) strips to those of various other shapes and geometries .",
    "of particular interest is the comparison with a single elliptic strip , i.e. , the generic shape defining demagnetization effects , and a single platelet strip , the simplest system exhibiting a geometric barrier . in the elliptic case , vortices",
    "penetrate the sample above a field @xmath711 ( @xmath712 ) , distribute uniformly inside the sample , and produce a reversible response ( in the absence of a surface barrier ) .",
    "the penetration of vortices in a platelet sample is impeded by a geometrical energy barrier ( and potentially an additional surface barrier ) at the sample edges , @xmath713 .",
    "once this barrier is overcome , vortices occupy a finite region inside the sample ( vortex dome ) , while the rest carries the diamagnetic shielding currents . upon decreasing the applied field",
    ", the strip shows a irreversible response , where the penetrated flux is trapped inside the sample until the vortex dome expands to the sample edges .",
    "these qualitative features remain valid for an array of rectangular strips .",
    "the attention of the present work has mainly focused on the double strip . in the regime of a small gap parameter @xmath5 , where the strip system is equivalent to a single strip of width @xmath714 cut in half by a narrow gap ,",
    "the geometrical barrier is overcome at much lower applied fields @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath26 is the smallest geometric length , the situation still resembles the one of the single strip ; modifications concern the field of first penetration , @xmath715}$ ] , the exclusive penetration from the inner edges , and the asymmetric shape of the vortex domes leaning towards the gap .",
    "when the gap width @xmath2 drops below the thickness @xmath26 , the currents rearrange strongly , piling up at the inner surfaces and channeling a larger field through the central opening . in the limit @xmath566 , the geometrical barrier is maximally suppressed and the penetration field @xmath716 of the double strip coincides with that of a single ellipse with aspect ratio @xmath717 .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed cases where the magnetization decreases beyond penetration , here the magnetic response levels off at the magnitude @xmath718 , a factor @xmath604 above the magnetization at the penetration field .    in order to study the irreversibility due to the geometric barrier , we have examined the descending branch in the magnetization upon reduction of the field . remarkably , our analytic results show , that the initial slope of the descending branch is close to the meissner response , with a correction factor approaching unity when the reversing field approaches @xmath13 from above ; reversing the field at larger @xmath3 , the meissner slope is changed by a factor @xmath289 , where @xmath282 depends only on the point @xmath719 where the slope is evaluated , @xmath720 .",
    "surprisingly , the correction factor remains close to unity over a wide range of @xmath585 .",
    "the latter result is equally valid for both the single and narrow - gap ( @xmath55 ) double strip .",
    "in addition , we have examined the influence of the vortex currents in the shubnikov phase ; while our complex - analysis approach describes the vortex - phase in terms of a non - magnetic medium , it intrinsically exhibits a finite magnetic response .",
    "we have shown that the magnetization due to the structure of the vortex state in the dome remains small within the region @xmath721 where our analysis is valid .",
    "finally , we have extended our analysis to @xmath641 ( @xmath722 ) strips and have given a qualitative discussion of the field penetration for this more complex geometry .",
    "the suppression of the geometrical barrier can be beneficial in many circumstances , as the hysteretic behavior due to geometrical effects often obscures other interesting physical phenomena .",
    "e.g. , this has been the case in the identification of the vortex - lattice melting - transition in platelet - shaped layered biscco samples , where the irreversibility line potentially interferes with the first - order melting line : polishing the sample into a prism shape , the geometrical barrier could be suppressed , what allowed to demonstrate experimentally that melting and irreversibility are uncorrelated phenomena @xcite .",
    "another example is the competition between bulk pinning of vortices and pinning due to surface- and shape effects as analyzed in the present work : again , the suppression of the geometrical barrier provides access to an unambiguous study of bulk pinning phenomena . in evaluating different means to suppress the geometrical barrier",
    ", the generation of a simple gap or crack in the sample appears as a rather simple alternative .",
    "recently , the suppression of geometrical barriers in platelet biscco samples has also been observed when tilting the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this finding has been related to the appearance of josephson vortex stacks due to the parallel field component weakening the superconductor and channeling the perpendicular component of the magnetic field into the sample .",
    "relating our present study to this experiment , we have modeled a stack of josephson vortices by a sample crack ( of width @xmath2 ) and observe a similar suppression of the geometrical barrier .",
    "another topic where the suppression of geometrical barriers is advantageous is the generation of low - density vortex states , which are difficult to realize in bulk samples due to the rapid accumulation of vortices when increasing @xmath3 beyond @xmath21 . in elliptic samples ,",
    "low vortex densities of the order of @xmath723 could be achieved ; however , it appears difficult to fabricate samples with this shape . in a realistic platelet - shape sample ,",
    "typical vortex densities are larger , of order @xmath724 .",
    "introducing a narrow gap in the sample suppresses the geometrical barrier and low vortex densities @xmath725 can be reached .",
    "further possible applications of the narrow - gap double strip include the lensing of magnetic fields near the gap , what may be useful for focusing weak magnetic signals .",
    "finally , the analysis and results discussed in this paper may be of relevance in the design of superconducting atom chips for the manipulation of ultra - cold atoms @xcite ."
