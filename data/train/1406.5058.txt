    "however , various forms of radiative feedback can prevent efficient bh growth , making it difficult to reach @xmath8 within the age of the high - redshift universe @xcite .",

    "possible mechanisms to suppress h@xmath11 formation are photo dissociation by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation @xcite and collisional dissociation @xcite . in the absence of @xmath12 ,",
    "the primordial gas remains warm ( @xmath13k ) and may collapse monolithically without strong fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the resulting central protostar can grow via accretion at a high rate of @xmath14 .",
    "if the accretion rate maintains such a high value , the embryonic protostar evolves to a sms with mass of @xmath0 .",
    "the sms collapses as a whole to a single bh either directly @xcite , or via the intermediate stage of a close binary bh @xcite , through a general relativistic instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the massive remnant bh is then a promising seed that can grow into one of the observed smbhs at @xmath15 .    in the scenario",
    "above , a major unresolved question is whether rapid accretion will continue unabated through the protostellar evolution .",
    "recent high - resolution simulations by @xcite suggest that the compact nuclear accretion disc , surrounding a central embryonic protostar , is gravitationally unstable .",
    "thus , self - gravitating clumps are expected to form during the early stages of the accretion phase .",
    "such efficient fragmentation could prevent the rapid growth of the central protostar , and preclude eventual sms formation .",
    "this is analogous to the fragmentation of gravitationally unstable discs in the cores of lower mass ` minihaloes ' , which had been suggested to reduce the characteristic masses of population iii ( pop iii ) stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the gas is slightly polluted by heavy elements ( @xmath16 ) , dust cooling can decrease the temperature and induce the fragmentation @xcite , which would be a further obstacle to sms formation .",
    "because of this , the existence of the pristine , metal - free gas has often been considered as a necessary condition of forming a sms in semi - analytical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that even very efficient fragmentation may not prevent accretion on to a central point source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the rapid inward migration of the fragments , on a time - scale comparable to the orbital period , may help its growth further ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in our context , however , even a slow down of the accretion rate could bring it below the critical value required for sms formation .    in this paper , motivated by the above ,",
    "we discuss the expected properties of a compact , marginally unstable nuclear protogalactic disc , and the fate of the clumps formed in the disc by gravitational instability . using analytical models",
    ", we argue that despite fragmentation , the growth of a sms remains the most likely outcome .",
    "the reason for this conclusion is the rapid inward migration of the fragments , and their merger with the central protostar .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec:2 ] , we describe the basic model of the fragmenting disc and of the clumps formed in the disc . in   [ sec : fate ] , we discuss the fate of the clumps , considering various important processes : migration , accretion , contraction , and star - formation by reaching the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "we also consider the possibility that radiative feedback from massive stars , formed from the clumps , may halt gas accretion on to the whole system . in   [ sec : metal ] , we discuss whether metal pollution and associated dust cooling could prohibit sms formation .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider the properties of a disc formed after the collapse of primordial gas inside an atomic cooling halo , when molecular hydrogen formation is suppressed .",
    "since the parent gas cloud is hot ( @xmath17 k ) , the accretion rate on to the disc is high : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sound speed and @xmath20 is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "the accretion disc around the central protostar can become unstable against self - gravity . to understand the stability of the disc ,",
    "toomre s parameter @xcite defined by @xmath21 is often useful , where @xmath22 is the orbital frequency and @xmath23 is the surface density of the disc . in the marginal case of @xmath24 , strong spiral arms",

    "the spiral arms redistribute angular momentum and heat the disc by forming shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since the gas temperature in the atomic cooling halo is kept near @xmath26 k , the external accretion rate on to the disc , from larger radii , is also nearly constant .",
    "we estimate the surface density of the self - regulated disc by assuming that it is in steady state , and that it has an effective viscosity @xmath27 ( arising from gravitational torques ) , @xmath28 the scale - height of the disc is estimated from vertical hydrostatic balance , @xmath29 we define the particle number density as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the proton mass .",
    "ccc                to determine the thermal state of the disc we assume that it is in equilibrium , i.e. we balance heating and radiative cooling ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "in particular , we consider viscous heating by turbulence and spiral shocks , @xmath33 and radiative cooling @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the cooling rate in units of erg s@xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "for the cooling process , we consider h@xmath38 free - bound emission , which is the dominant channel in the thermal evolution at @xmath39 for a warm primordial gas in an atomic cooling halo .",
    "the form of the cooling rate is given in ",
    "[ sec : chem ] .",
    "finally , we adopt the standard @xmath40-prescription as a model for the viscosity by gravitational torques : @xmath41 where @xmath40 is the viscous parameter . from hydrodynamical simulations of a self - gravitating disc , the disc",
    "is found to be susceptible to fragmentation if the viscous parameter exceeds a critical threshold value , @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have studied fragmentation conditions for various specific heat ratios , and obtained @xmath43 . however , the critical value depends on both initial conditions and on numerical resolution @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have considered mass loading from an infalling envelope , realistic radiative cooling , and radiative trapping of energy inside clumps , and suggested that the critical value for fragmentation is around @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of fragmentation of discs with relatively high accretion rates ( @xmath45 ) , in the context of present - day massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and pop iii star formation @xcite have shown that the effective viscous parameter arising from gravitational torques is @xmath46 .",
    "based on these results , we here set @xmath47 as our fiducial value , and analyze disc fragmentation using the condition of @xmath48 following previous analytical works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in dense ( @xmath39 ) and warm ( @xmath49 k ) primordial gas ,",
    "the dominant cooling processes is the free - bound emission of h@xmath38 ions ( h + e@xmath38 @xmath50 h@xmath38 + @xmath51 ; @xcite ) . the cooling rate , in units of erg s@xmath36 @xmath37 , is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the free - electron fraction and @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 in units of kelvin ) .",

    "as described above , we assume that fragmentation occurs efficiently at the radii where @xmath64 . from figure",
    "[ fig : profile](c ) , we find that fragmentations occur in the central regions where the orbital period is shorter than @xmath65 yr . within the fragmenting region ,",
    "the surface density is approximately given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 g @xmath68 and @xmath69 s@xmath36 , respectively . during the earliest stages ,",
    "i.e. prior to the formation of any central protostar embryo , or immediately following it , the disc mass dominates the central protostellar mass .",
    "we can then obtain the radius within which the disc fragments effectively , @xmath70 moreover , during this stage , the profiles of the surface density , disc mass , and number density can be written as functions of the radial distance @xmath71 from the central protostar : @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "the typical mass of the clumps formed at @xmath75 is estimated as @xmath76 these disc profiles and the clump mass are in good agreement with the highest resolution results in the numerical simulations by @xcite , lending credence to our simplified ` toy ' model .    in the above",
    ", we have assumed that the mass of the central protostar is negligible .",
    "however , the central protostar grows via rapid accretion and having a central point source can then modify the disc structure .",
    "after @xmath77 yr , the gas within @xmath78 accretes on to the central protostar , and the protostellar mass exceeds the disc mass within @xmath78 .",
    "the fragmentation radius ( defined by @xmath79 ) remains roughly constant for the first @xmath80 yr , after which it begins to move outward slowly , according to @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass of the protostellar embryo at the center , and we have assumed that the central accretion rate remains constant over time . in the regions where @xmath83 , the orbital frequency is proportional to @xmath84 and thus the surface density and mass of the disc are given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . the radius where @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 the condition @xmath89 is satisfied when the protostellar mass exceeds @xmath90 , which corresponds to @xmath91 .",
    "for convenience in the following section (   [ sec : fate ] ) , we define the transition epoch as @xmath92 yr neglecting the difference of the factor of 3 because the ratio of @xmath93 does not change significantly in the range @xmath94 yr . therefore , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig0 ] ) and ( [ eq : md0 ] ) for @xmath95 and eqs .",

    "in the fragmenting disc , the evolution of the clumps is determined by several physical processes , including migration , accretion , and evolution to zams stars . in this section ,",
    "we consider these processes , and discuss the fate of the clumps formed at the fragmentation radius .",
    "the clumps formed at @xmath78 interact with the disc through gravitational torques , which results in their orbital evolution , i.e. ` migration ' .",
    "we first discuss the time - scales for limiting cases of inward migration applicable to planets embedded in smooth discs ; this serves as a useful reference .",
    "we then discuss the complications and uncertainties for protogalactic discs , arising from the fact that the disc is clumpy , and the nominal migration rate is very rapid .    limiting cases of idealized migration",
    "are well - known in the theory of disc - planet interactions .",
    "one is the case when the planet mass is so small that the perturbation induced in the disc is in the linear regime .",
    "the density waves excited in the disc by the planet exert torques on the planet through resonances , and thus promote the migration ( so - called type  i migration ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic time - scale of type  i migration is @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the power of the surface density profile @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "a second case is when the planet mass is massive enough to clear a gap in the disc ( but still less massive than the local disc ) .",
    "then , the planet migrates inward on approximately the discs s viscous time - scale ( so - called type  ii migration ; e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath103    the theoretical basis for these time - scales is derived from idealized setups , assuming point - like planets and a smooth disc profile .",
    "whether these results are applicable for an extended clump , in a gravitationally unstable and lumpy disc , as we discuss in this paper is poorly known .",
    "nevertheless , recent numerical simulations have provided some useful information .",
    "in particular , low - mass planets embedded in a turbulent disc have been found to migrate inwards , despite the stochastic kicks due to the turbulent density fluctuations , essentially on the time - scale of type i migration @xcite . if the clump grows via accretion and opens a gap during its migration in the gravitationally unstable disc , a transition between type  i and type  ii migration occurs and the migration speed slows down @xcite .    from the disc properties discussed in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] , we expect that the characteristic migration time shifts from that of type  ii to that of type  i , because the mass ratio @xmath104 decreases as the central protostar ( and the mass of the corresponding steady - state disc ) grows .",
    "we therefore estimate the transition epoch and the migration time for the late phase ( @xmath105 ) using eq .",
    "( [ eq : typei ] ) .",
    "the gap - opening condition has been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but again , remains poorly known for gravitationally unstable and clumpy discs . to give a conservative estimate ,",
    "we here do not discuss the gap - opening condition , but compare the time - scales of type  i and ii migration .",
    "the ratio of the two time - scales at @xmath78 ( eq .  [ eq : rf_late ] ) is independent of the central mass , and is given by @xmath106 where we have used the condition @xmath107 . since the clumps grow via accretion at a typical rate of at least @xmath108 ( see   [ sec : kh ] ) , the clump migrates towards the central protostar on a time - scale comparable or shorter than that in the type  ii case , independent of the presence or absence of a gap . in the following , we therefore adopt @xmath109 as a conservative choice for the migration time - scale .",
    "we first estimate the migration time for the case that the self - gravity of the disc within @xmath78 dominates the protostellar gravity ( i.e. @xmath95 ) . at this stage ,",
    "the mass of the central protostar is @xmath110 . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : md0 ] ) and ( [ eq : m_c ] ) , the clump mass is initially smaller than the local disc mass ( @xmath111 ) . in the disc - dominated case , the orbital decay time of the clump ( @xmath112 )",
    "is approximately given by the viscous time ( eq .  [ eq : typeii ] ; see also @xcite who find a factor of few faster migration in the case they studied ) . since @xmath113 at @xmath78 , @xmath114 yr .",
    "thus , we find that the clump orbit decays slightly faster than the orbital period .",
    "this follows essentially from our assumption of @xmath115 , and leads to a complication : eq .",
    "( [ eq : typeii ] ) for the type  ii migration rate is strictly valid only for @xmath116 because the torques exerted on the clump are assumed to be averaged over an orbit ( at a fixed radius ) . despite this complication",
    ", we can still safely conclude @xmath117 .",
    "this is because assuming a slower migration ( @xmath118 ) would justify the use of orbit - averaged type  ii torques , which would then yield the contradiction @xmath119 .",

    "[ fig : mig ] , we show the corresponding orbital evolution for @xmath121 ( blue middle curve ) and @xmath122 ( red right most curve ) as examples of this stage . in both the cases",
    ", we do not consider the clump growth because the initial clump mass is much smaller than the disc mass within @xmath78 and thus the slow - down effect works after the orbit has decayed by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "for @xmath135 , the fragmentation radius moves out to @xmath136 pc . in this case , the decay time becomes longer than the orbital period , and the clump could evolve into a normal massive star , rather than an sms .",
    "however , this scenario is realized only by assuming that a sms with @xmath137 has already grown at the center of the disc .      in the fragmenting disc ,",
    "many clumps are formed within @xmath78 and their orbits decay through interaction with the accretion disc .",
    "since the typical density of the clumps is @xmath138 ( eq .

    "the time - scale of the kh contraction is estimated as @xmath149 thus , it is longer than both the migration time for @xmath150 and the orbital period at the fragmentation radius .",
    "therefore , most clumps formed promptly in the early ( disc - dominated ) phase are expected to migrate and merge with the central protostar before reaching the massive zams stars ( @xmath150 ) . on the other hand , clumps formed in the late ( central protostar - dominated ) phase ( @xmath151 )",

    "the compressional heating and collisional cooling are balanced as @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the free - fall time and @xmath204 is the energy exchange rate ( in erg s@xmath36 @xmath37 ) between the gas and dust , defined by @xmath205 for @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the number density and cross - section of the dust particles from , @xmath207 where the depletion factor of metals to dusts is assumed as high as the present - day galactic value @xmath208 . from eqs .",

    "( [ eq : d4 ] ) is comparable to that at the fragmenting radius .",
    "this implies that the discussion in   [ sec : fate ] remains valid in metal - polluted gas , as long as the metallicity remains below @xmath16 .",
    "we conclude that disc fragmentation can not prevent sms formation , as long as the metallicity is below this value . on the other hand , at higher metallicity ( @xmath210 ) , the gas temperature rapidly decreases by metal - line cooling at densities below @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of metal - enriched collapse into atomic cooling haloes also capture the character of gas fragmentation for @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "the outcome would be a compact star - cluster which consists of many low - mass stars with @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the properties of a disc around the embryo of a sms ( @xmath0 ) , expected to be present in a primordial gas without h@xmath11 molecules in massive haloes with virial temperature @xmath77 k. a high accretion rate @xmath214 , sustained for @xmath215yr , is required to form a sms .",
    "the inner region of such a disc is gravitationally unstable , and fragments into @xmath216 clumps with characteristic mass of @xmath217 .",
    "we discuss the possibility that this fragmentation prevents sms formation .",
    "we argue that most of the clumps formed in the disc rapidly migrate towards the central protostar and merge with it .",
    "the orbital decay time is shorter than or comparable to the orbital period of the clumps ( @xmath218 yr ) .",
    "some of the clumps can grow via accretion and evolve to zams stars within their kh time , either because they survive longer due to the stochasticity of the migration process , or because they form later , further out in the disc .",
    "our toy model , on which these conclusions are based , can be tested against simulations of pop iii star formation in lower mass minihaloes . in this case , the dominant cooling process is h@xmath11 line emission ( @xmath219 k ) and the resulting accretion rate is @xmath220 , which is smaller than that in the sms formation case . according to high - resolution numerical simulations by @xcite , clump formation occurs at @xmath221 au ( @xmath222 g @xmath68 , @xmath223 yr@xmath36 , @xmath224 km s@xmath36 and @xmath225 in their fig .",
    "2 ) in the gravitationally unstable disc at the early stage @xmath226 yr . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_f_early ] ) , we can estimate the fragmentation radius as @xmath227 au , which is consistent with the fragmentation radii in the simulations . at this stage ,",
    "the average accretion rate is high , @xmath228 in their fig .",
    "8 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : continue ] ) , ( [ eq : scaleheight ] ) , ( [ eq : viscous ] ) , and @xmath25 , @xmath229 using these equations , the sound speed at the fragmentation radius ( @xmath47 ) is estimated as @xmath230 km s@xmath36 , which agrees well with the numerical result .",
    "the viscous time at @xmath221 au is roughly estimated as @xmath231 yr . since some clumps migrate inward within @xmath232 yr ( @xmath233 ) in simulation , other effects ( type i migration and interaction between clumps ) could accelerate the clumps migration .",
    "therefore , our results from the toy model are expected to be conservative , and appear to capture the essential features of disc fragmentation and clump migration .",
    "the gas in most of the massive haloes is likely to be polluted by heavy elements due to prior star formation and pop iii supernovae . with the metallicity of @xmath234 , the dust cooling decreases the temperature rapidly and could promote the fragmentation at @xmath235 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the existence of dusts has been considered as one of the most severe obstacles to the sms formation .",
    "however , the fragmentation induced by the dust cooling is expected to occur only within the fragmenting radius we estimated .",
    "this means that the clumps formed by the dust cooling can migrate towards the center on a time - scale comparable to the orbital period , in the same way as the primordial case .",
    "we conclude that the sms formation is not prevented , unless the metal - line cooling dominates for @xmath236 .",
    "our results therefore remove a significant obstacle for sms formation .    our estimates for the orbital decay time of the clumps",
    "are based on the well - known formulae of type  i and ii planetary migration .",
    "although some numerical simulations find that these formulae remain approximately valid in gravitationally unstable and clumpy discs , there are many uncertainties regarding the migration rate in this case . for example",
    ", we neglect the orbital eccentricities of the clumps .",
    "the clumps formed by the disc fragmentation are expected to have eccentric orbits and thus the angular momentum transfer between the disc and clumps could change from the case of the circular orbits . moreover , in such a situation , the interaction with eccentric clumps retard the orbital decay of the other clumps @xcite . to estimate the migration time within the clumpy disc around the sms star , more sophisticated numerical simulations are necessary .",
    "it is worth further emphasizing the limitations and uncertainties of our disc model . in figure",
    "[ fig : profile ] , we present the disc profile based on cooling by free - bound emission of h@xmath38 and thermal equilibrium .",
    "hydrogen atomic cooling ( ly@xmath40 and two - photon emission ) dominates at @xmath237 k ( @xmath238 yr ) . to quantify the effect , we include ly@xmath40 cooling ( @xmath239 ; @xcite ) in the limiting optically thin case ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "since the gas is in fact optically thick to the ly@xmath40 photons at @xmath240 , and the cooling efficiency of the two - photon channel is smaller than the ly@xmath40 emission , the dashed lines overestimate the additional atomic cooling rate .",
    "nevertheless , the profiles deviate from our fiducial disc model only modestly , beginning at @xmath238 yr and thus the critical period changes at most within the shaded region in figure  [ fig : profile ] ( c ) .",
    "the crucial ingredient of this paper is the critical value of the effective viscous parameter @xmath241 for fragmentation . in our model ,",
    "the fragmentation radius depends sensitively on the value of @xmath241 . for example , if we chose @xmath242 , we obtain @xmath243 s@xmath36 ( @xmath244 yr ) , @xmath245 g @xmath68 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 pc . in this case , the orbital decay time becomes longer than the kh time of the clumps by a factor of 4 , and most of the clumps may evolve to massive stars and emit strong uv radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the number of clumps decreases by a factor of 2 from the case of @xmath248 ( see eq . [",
    "eq : nc ] ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that our main conclusion also does not change . however , if @xmath249 , the fragmenting radius moves outside the size of the whole disc given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rd ] ) , which means that the disc can not exist , i.e. , our model is no longer self - consistent . to explore the precise value of @xmath241",
    "is left for future investigations . in particular ,",
    "our results motivate high - resolution numerical simulations similar to @xcite .",
    "moreover , more realistic treatments of radiative cooling and chemical reactions at densities higher than @xmath250 @xcite should be included since the fragmentation efficiency strongly depends on the equation of state of the gas .    despite these caveats",
    ", we expect that sms formation in metal - poor gas in atomic - cooling haloes is difficult to avoid , as it requires that the high mass inflow rate , @xmath14 , is democratically distributed among @xmath251 fragments ( so that _ none _ of them accretes at a super critical rate for sms formation ) and that most of these fragments survive rapid migration and avoid coalescence with the growing central protostar for several orbital times .",
