    "the existence of large extra dimensions , of size much larger than the planck length , has been recently proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add )  @xcite as an alternative means of solving the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it has been argued that , if the sm fields were localized in a four dimensional brane located in a compact flat spatial bulk of radius @xmath0 , which allows the free propagation of gravitons , the physical planck scale associated with the gravity properties at distances much larger than @xmath0 will be given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fundamental planck scale and @xmath3 is the number of extra dimensions . for this mechanism to provide a solution of the hierarchy problem",
    ", @xmath2 should be on the order of a tev . since gravity will look ( @xmath4 ) dimensional at distances much shorter than @xmath0",
    ", the compactification radius can not be larger than a millimeter .",
    "while such a bound is inconsistent with a solution to the hierarchy problem in the case @xmath5 , it is naturally fulfilled for @xmath6 .",
    "the smaller @xmath3 , the larger becomes @xmath0 and , for @xmath7 , the predicted deviation of the gravity behavior is being tested in table - top experiments  @xcite .",
    "since the fundamental scale @xmath2 is of order a tev , non - trivial modifications will also appear in the ultraviolet regime of energies close to @xmath2 . from a four dimensional point of view",
    ", the ultraviolet effects will be associated with the emission of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states , representing the propagation of the graviton in the extra dimensional bulk .",
    "although individual kk gravitons will couple very weakly to sm particles , the cumulative effect of kk gravitons will lead to interactions which become strong at energy scales of order @xmath2 . for collider center - of - mass energies approaching @xmath2 , graviton emission",
    "can be observed as missing energy signatures , or as virtual effects that interfere with sm processes  @xcite .",
    "nonobservation of these collider effects places a lower bound on @xmath2 of about a tev . from the above considerations",
    ", it seems clear that , for a compact _ flat _ bulk space , @xmath0 can not be larger than a millimeter without producing gross deviations from four dimensional gravity at macroscopic scales .",
    "this point of view has been recently challenged by the authors of ref .",
    "they show that , if @xmath8 and @xmath0 is taken to be infinitely large , the possible inclusion of a local four dimensional einstein term in the brane ( see also  @xcite ) may lead to short  distance behavior that resembles the usual four dimensional propagation of gravitons .",
    "moreover , in ref .  @xcite it was argued that if the number of dimensions is larger than five , @xmath6 , one obtains four dimensional behavior for the graviton at all scales .",
    "however , for @xmath6 this result is derived from expressions involving an ultraviolet divergent contribution coming from the propagation of gravitons in the bulk , and therefore the case @xmath6 deserves a more detailed analysis .",
    "this is particularly so since we are considering a non - renormalizable theory with a physical ultraviolet cutoff which can not be larger than the ( @xmath4 ) dimensional planck scale @xmath2 , at which gravity interactions in the extra dimensional bulk become strong .    in this paper",
    "we will introduce both an infrared ( ir ) and an ultraviolet ( uv ) regularization .",
    "the ir regularization is implemented by means of a @xmath3 dimensional torus with common radius @xmath0 .",
    "we introduce a physical uv cutoff @xmath9 by truncating the number of kk - modes at @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . the case of @xmath12 dimensional minkowski space considered in refs .",
    "@xcite will appear as the @xmath13 limit . in this limit",
    "we will reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of one extra dimension ; moreover for @xmath6 we reproduce the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , when we fix the uv cutoff to a natural physical value @xmath15 , the results we obtain are different from those obtained in  @xcite .    for the case of finite radius ( toroidal )",
    "extra dimensions the presence of brane gravitational corrections could substantially modify the usual add scenario .",
    "in fact we shall show that , depending on the strength of those corrections , either the collider or table - top gravitational signatures can be substantially altered .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we study the structure of the bulk graviton propagator including the brane corrections for an arbitrary number of flat extra dimensions . in section 3",
    "we consider the @xmath13 limit to compare with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . in section 4",
    "we consider the case of finite radius and analyze the physical features of the relevant momentum ( or distance ) regimes .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the phenomenology , including collider experiments and gravitational table - top experiments .",
    "finally our conclusions and outlook are presented in section 6 and some lengthy formulae are exhibited in appendix a.",
    "we start with a @xmath12 dimensional theory with coordinates @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the four dimensional space - time coordinates and @xmath18 , ( @xmath19 ) those of the compact space and assume a 3-brane embedded in the @xmath12 dimensional space at @xmath20 .",
    "we shall assume that the brane thickness is small compared to the @xmath12 dimensional planck length , and model it by a delta function in the extra dimensions .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall consider , for simplicity , a single bulk scalar field @xmath21 , instead of the more complicated tensor structure of a graviton , propagating in the @xmath12 dimensional space , with the action : @xmath22 where @xmath2 is the higher dimensional planck scale , @xmath23 is the coefficient of the brane - generated correction , and we have scaled the @xmath24 field to be dimensionless .",
    "( [ action ] ) should be regarded as the leading terms in a bulk+brane effective action for dynamics in a @xmath12 dimensional flat space background ( we are ignoring bulk+brane cosmological constant terms ) .",
    "the effective action will be valid up to some physical ultraviolet cutoff @xmath9 , where it matches onto a more fundamental uv description .",
    "since bulk gravity becomes strongly interacting at the energy scale @xmath2 , we expect that the case of interest is @xmath9 not much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the brane - generated kinetic term with coefficient @xmath23 could be induced from the coupling between bulk gravity ( the bulk scalar , in our simplified treatment ) and the brane matter fields .",
    "as noted in @xcite , graviton vacuum polarization diagrams with brane matter loops will generically produce such a term .",
    "for example , if there are @xmath25 heavy brane particles of mass @xmath26 , they will generate a contribution to @xmath23 on the order of @xmath27 times a loop factor  @xcite-@xcite . even in an effective theory with a cutoff @xmath28 , it is consistent to imagine that @xmath23 may be much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "this occurs in the example above if @xmath25 is large ; it could also arise from dynamical sources such as coupling to brane or bulk fields which have large vacuum expectation values .",
    "other possibilities include a large @xmath23 related to physics of the fundamental uv theory . on",
    "the other hand @xmath29 introduces a hierarchy problem , which would have to be addressed in a complete model .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the green function for the propagation of the scalar field from a point in the brane to any point in the @xmath12 dimensional space .",
    "the equation for the corresponding green function , after making a fourier transform over the four dimensional space - time coordinates , is @xmath30g_d(p , y_i)= \\delta^{(d)}(y_i)\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the four dimensional euclidean momentum and @xmath32 is the laplacian operator in @xmath3 dimensions .    the solution to eq .",
    "( [ generaleq ] ) can be written as follows , @xcite :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the solution to the equation @xmath35    a way to solve eq .",
    "( [ laplace ] ) is by fourier series , since the extra dimensions are finite .",
    "we will only be interested in the behavior of the higher dimensional propagator on the 3-brane , that is for @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the form for @xmath37 is just the sum @xmath38 where the vector @xmath39 is defined as , @xmath40 .",
    "the green function on the 3-brane @xmath41 could also be obtained after integration of the action ( [ action ] ) over the extra dimensional coordinates @xmath42 , which yields the four dimensional lagrangian for the kk - states @xmath43 , @xmath44 the green function on the 3-brane is the sum over four dimensional propagators . to compute it",
    "we consider the first two terms in ( [ lag4 ] ) as the unperturbed lagrangian , giving rise to the sum    @xmath45    ( 70,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(90,50)410    @xmath46    ( 70,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(90,50)410    and the last term as the perturbed lagrangian , giving rise to the mixing    @xmath47    ( 70,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(90,50)410 ( 90,50)5 ( 95,50)(165,50)410    @xmath48    in this way the complete green function @xmath41 can be computed as    @xmath49    ( 50,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(80,50)48    +    ( 50,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(80,50)48 ( 80,50)5 ( 85,50)(145,50)48    +    ( 50,30)(0,28 ) ( 20,50)(80,50)48 ( 80,50)5 ( 85,50)(145,50)48 ( 145,50)5 ( 150,50)(210,50)48    @xmath50    and coincides with the expression obtained from ( [ solution1 ] ) and ( [ kk ] ) .",
    "we have computed the sum over the four dimensional propagators in the original field basis , without explicitly diagonalizing the lagrangian ( [ lag4 ] ) . in the basis of canonically normalized mass eigenstates for the lagrangian ( [ lag4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath41 is just the sum over the exact kk propagators , with mode dependent residues proportional to the square of the coupling of the corresponding eigenstates to matter , whereas @xmath37 is the sum over the unperturbed kk propagators .    in principle",

    "however since , as we mentioned in the previous section , @xmath82 , in the limit @xmath83 we can not neglect the constant term in the denominator of ( [ 2large ] ) for all momenta . as we did in the five dimensional case",

    "the green function is logarithmic and as such it corresponds to the propagator in a six dimensional theory . only for distances",
    "@xmath77 the quadratic term dominates , leading to the typical behaviour of the propagator in a four dimensional theory .",

    "we shall describe the green function in the region where @xmath68 , and we shall put emphasis on the case in which the cutoff of the effective theory @xmath9 is identified with the higher dimensional planck scale @xmath2 . the physical ( four dimensional ) planck mass is defined as @xmath112 and it is associated with the interaction strength of the massless graviton appearing in the spectrum of the theory for any value of @xmath3 .",

    "the dashed line represents the projected experimental sensitivity of ref .",
    "the crossing of solid and dashed curves will impose some upper bounds on @xmath23 .",
    "we will assume in this subsection that @xmath6 and @xmath180 , so that for the energies accessible at present and future high - energy collider we can approximate the green function as one where the large number of kk modes behave like an `` effective '' resonance state , given by eqs .",
    "( [ green7 ] ) , with mass @xmath103 and width controlled by @xmath181 , eq .",
    "( [ generalw ] ) . in the @xmath182 limit",
    "( i.e. @xmath183 ) one recovers the add ( constant ) result .",
    "however for values of @xmath180 there will be important modifications of add collider phenomenology , both on kk graviton production and on virtual graviton mediated processes , that will be briefly analyzed in this section .      as it was already emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , processes with kk graviton production are an important signature of extra dimensions .",
    "they appear as missing - energy events where a particle ( photon @xmath184 , quark @xmath185 or gluon @xmath186 ) is produced and no observable particle is balancing its transverse momentum .",
    "given the huge number of kk modes and , correspondingly , the smallness of their mass differences , we can replace the production sum of kk modes by a continuous integration , and write the differential cross - section for inclusive graviton production ( i.e. @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 ) as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the differential cross - section for production of a single ( canonically normalized ) kk mode with mass @xmath26 and a coupling strength to matter @xmath118 , and @xmath193 . the expression for @xmath194",
    "is given by @xmath195    from ( [ imaginario ] ) we can see that for @xmath196 , @xmath197 in this way the kk modes which are much lighter than @xmath103 couple to matter as in the add scenario .",
    "therefore , if @xmath198 , the differential cross section for the reaction @xmath199 is @xmath200 where @xmath165 is the electromagnetic constant and @xmath201 the scattering angle in the center - of - mass system .    on the other hand , for @xmath202 the imaginary part of the green function behaves as , @xmath203 and the corresponding kk modes couple to matter as @xmath204 times the ordinary newton constant .",
    "to estimate the integral in ( [ produccion ] ) we have found , for @xmath205 , to a good accuracy , @xmath206 where we have used the smallness of @xmath181 and the property @xmath207 . in this way , the collective effect of all kk modes behaves as the production of a single sharp resonance of mass @xmath103 and coupling @xmath133 .",
    "this signature is very distinct from add .",
    "for example , for @xmath208 , and neglecting terms of @xmath209 , the differential cross section ( [ prodg ] ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath210 the modes with mass smaller and larger than @xmath211 give a total contribution proportional to @xmath212 and @xmath213 , respectively .",
    "these contributions are sub - dominant for @xmath214 , while for @xmath7 can be at most of order of the contribution of the collective mode of mass @xmath103 , eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) . in this way",
    "the present bounds from this process at lep2 in add can be easily translated into the lower bound @xmath215 tev whenever @xmath103 is kinematically accessible to this machine .",
    "if @xmath103 is not energetically accessible , the bound on @xmath23 disappears and it is replaced by a bound on @xmath2 similar to that obtained in the add case  @xcite . of course much stronger bounds will be obtained from future accelerators .",
    "the effective resonance of mass @xmath103 can also contribute to physical processes by a single virtual exchange in the s - channel , along with the exchange of other standard model particles .",
    "it can contribute sizeably to the cross - sections if the center - of - mass energy @xmath86 is close to @xmath103 .",
    "in that case its contribution to the cross - sections is proportional to    @xmath216    with @xmath217 ^ 2}\\ .\\ ] ] at the resonance peak there is an enhancement , with respect to the ( constant ) add contribution , as @xmath218 while the distribution width @xmath219 is essentially governed by the ratio @xmath220 .",
    "an example of the resonance distribution is given in fig .",
    "[ colliders ] , where the function @xmath221 is plotted for the case @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "this paper deals with the effect of kinetic brane gravitational corrections on extra dimensional scenarios .",
    "these corrections can be induced by interactions of bulk gravitons with matter localized on the brane and their size is not protected by any four dimensional symmetry acting on the brane . to avoid the complication inherent to the tensor structure of the higher dimensional graviton we have worked out a prototype model with a simple scalar field propagating in the bulk of the extra dimensions .",
    "this work was partly motivated by the recent and interesting claim that for the case of two ( or more ) infinite size flat extra dimensions kinetic brane corrections trigger higher dimensional gravitons to be localized on the brane . moreover , for finite size radius we also expect kinetic brane gravitational corrections to substantially modify the usual picture initially introduced by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali as an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem and , in particular , its implications on collider phenomenology and table - top gravitational experiments .    we have endowed the theory with both an ir and an uv regularization . the ir regularization is implemented by a @xmath3 dimensional torus with a common radius @xmath0 .",
    "the infinite size can then be reached in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "the uv regularization is provided by a physical uv cutoff @xmath9 .",
    "since the higher dimensional gravitational theory is an effective one , with a physical cutoff of the order of the higher dimensional planck scale , @xmath2 , the cutoff @xmath9 is restricted to be @xmath224 , or even less if the brane is fat , a possibility that , for simplicity , we are not considering .    for the case of infinite size extra dimensions , @xmath13 , were we allowed to take the @xmath14 limit , we would recover the results of refs .",
    "however , as @xmath225 , as we pointed out above , our results for infinite size extra dimensions do not lead to the existence of tensor gravity localized on the brane but , instead , lead in general to a massive graviton . to summarize , in the absence of a quantum field theory of gravity in higher dimensions",
    ", the existence of a physical uv cutoff prevents localization of tensor gravity on the brane in the presence of infinite size extra dimensions .    for the case of finite extra dimensions ,",
    "kinetic brane gravitational corrections induce deep modifications on the add scenario . in particular the emergence of a `` collective '' state ( made out of an `` infinite '' number of kk modes ) with a mass @xmath226 and an effective coupling @xmath227 , where @xmath23 is the brane correction . for @xmath228 ,",
    "this state can be detected in table - top gravitational experiments , while add collider phenomenology is deeply modified since kk gravitons become unobservable in high - energy colliders . on the other hand , for @xmath229 , table - top gravitational experiments are blind to the new state and so table - top gravitational phenomenology remains essentially unchanged .",
    "on the other hand the new resonance can be produced on - shell at high - energy colliders and then also modify the add phenomenology .",
