    "variability has a very high incidence among cool stars ; however the existence of @xmath7 or more _ hipparcos _ measurements per star spread over several years , together with the excellent temporal stability of the magnitude scale , permits the detection of variability at the level of few hundredths of a magnitude .",

    "altogether , they provided new @xmath8 ( and @xmath9 for the brightest sources ) measurements for more than 370 nltt stars .",
    "we have used the simbad classification plus the essential notes as given in the aforementioned papers to remove double , variables , flares , possible misclassification and stars with nearby companions ( or background stars ) that could affect the photometric measurements .",

    "altogether , we have retained 94 stars with @xmath10 and 157 with @xmath8 photometry .",
    "we also took a few very red dwarfs from henry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who measured @xmath8 colours using standards from graham ( 1982 ) , bessell ( 1990a ) and landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "these stars are also generally fainter and the accuracy is somewhat lower , with a typical uncertainty of @xmath11 mag in each band ( henry et al .",
    "we have selected 11 such stars , all closer than 40 pc . finally , another source of @xmath8 photometry for very red stars is from bessell ( 1991 ) , from which we took 5 stars . for the stars in henry",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) and bessell ( 1991 ) we have used the simbad classification to avoid flares or variables , although in this case the most affected bands would be the blue ones ( @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) which we do not have for these stars .",
    "all the stars presented in section [ jc ] have @xmath13 photometry from 2mass . in",
    "what follows we will use only stars with total photometric errors ( as given from 2mass ) smaller than 0.10 mag ( i.e. `` j_''@xmath14``h_''@xmath14``k_msigcom''@xmath15 ) , thus reducing our final sample to 343 stars .",
    "the typical errors in @xmath16 and @xmath17 are around 0.023 mag , whereas a slightly larger uncertainty ( 0.032 mag ) affects @xmath18 band photometry .    for most of the koen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) stars , excellent saao @xmath19 photometry is also available ( kilkenny et al .",
    "2007 ) : this additional photometry is very valuable to check the accuracy of the 2mass zero - points and the dependence of the proposed temperature scale on the adopted absolute calibration . as we show in appendix b , the saao ir photometry confirms the adopted 2mass zero - points and absolute calibration .      measuring metallicities for m dwarfs is still challenging .",
    "with decreasing temperature , the spectra show increasingly abundant diatomic and triatomic molecules .",
    "the molecular bands complicate the calculation of stellar model atmospheres and cause line blends , making it difficult to estimate the true continuum and to measure atomic line - strengths over large regions of the visible spectra .",
    "major advances in the field have been recently obtained using high  resolution spectra to measure equivalent widths of atomic lines in regions not dominated by molecular bands ( woolf & wallerstein 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "bonfils et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have measured the metallicity in 20 binary systems , having an m dwarf secondary and a warmer primary ( for which a metallicity is much more readily obtained ) .",
    "they combined their results with the abundances measured from woolf & wallerstein ( 2005 ) to calibrate an absolute @xmath17 band luminosity versus colour relation ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) as a function of metallicity .",
    "this results in a metallicity relation for m dwarfs , but since it depends on absolute magnitude , we apply it only to those of our stars with accurate parallaxes available from _ hipparcos_. altogether in our sample there are 118 stars with accurate 2mass photometry ( see section [ nir ] ) , _ hipparcos _ parallaxes better then 15% and within the range of applicability of the bonfils et al .",
    "( 2005 ) calibration .",
    "the formal accuracy of the relation is @xmath22  dex , however the uncertainty in parallaxes introduces an additional error that in the worst case can be of the same magnitude .",
    "therefore , we expect these metallicities to be accurate to @xmath5  dex .    in section [ mfm ] we will use these metallicities to calibrate our method to estimate [ m / h ] for the rest of the m dwarfs , whereas the model atmospheres are given for the total heavy elements fraction [ m / h ] . for low values of alpha  enhancement , the difference between the two is negligible , particularly since metallicity measurements in m dwarfs are still uncertain . in the rest of the paper we will refer to [ m / h ] , although this is in practice [ fe / h ] when we refer to empirical measurements . ] .",
    "we apply an extension of the irfm we developed for g and k dwarfs ( casagrande et al . 2006 ) to m dwarfs .",
    "while most of the bolometric flux of the stars is emitted in the optical and infrared and is covered by our observations , as in the earlier work , we use model atmospheres to estimate the small part ( typically less than 20% ) of the flux which is outside our observational bands .    pioneering work on m dwarfs model atmospheres trace back to tsuji ( 1969 ) and auman ( 1969 ) .",
    "the inclusion of sophisticated physics became available with the work of mould ( 1975 , 1976 ) and has steadily continued with allard ( 1990 ) , kui ( 1991 ) , brett & plez ( 1993 ) , allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) , brett ( 1995a , 1995b ) , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki(1996 ) , hauschildt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we use the most recent grid of model atmosphere publicly available at the phoenix project s website .",

    "below @xmath26 the grid is given in steps of @xmath27 in effective temperature and 0.5  dex in metallicity .",
    "the molecular line lists include about 700 million molecular lines , 15300 million of which are typically selected in a model .",
    "the equation of state is an extension of that used in allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) . for the coolest models the dust",
    "is assumed to form and to immediately rain out completely below the photosphere ( `` cond '' models ) so that it does not contribute to the opacity .",
    "full details are available in brott & hauschildt ( 2005 ) and references therein .",
    "since we are working with dwarf stars , we assume @xmath28 throughout .",
    "this assumption is in agreement with the values of @xmath29 determined from other techniques ( sgransan et al .",
    "2003 ; berger al . 2006 ; bean et al .",
    "as we will see later , a change of @xmath30  dex in the assumed surface gravity implies only minor differences in the derived parameters .",
    "the phoenix models also include variations of @xmath31elements for each metallicity .",
    "we have chosen to use models with no @xmath31enhancement ; in any case the use of @xmath31enhanced models in dwarfs of earlier spectral type does not change the results significantly ( casagrande et al .",
    "there are indications that m dwarfs follow the same [ @xmath31/fe ] vs. metallicity as measured in fgk dwarfs ( woolf & wallerstein 2005 ) and since our sample is limited to the solar neighborhood we do not expect significant signs of @xmath31enhancement .",
    "testing of synthetic model atmospheres is normally done by comparing observed and modelled spectral energy distributions for a range of wavelengths and spectral types ( e.g. tinney , mould & reid 1993 ; brett 1995b ; leggett et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 , 2001 ; burgasser , cruz & kirkpatrick 2007 ) . here",
    "we simply compare synthetic and empirical colours , showing that with good accuracy data right across the optical and infrared , photometry provides an excellent tool to test model atmospheres ( e.g. bessell , castelli & plez 1998 ) .",
    "the interested reader can find e.g.  in leggett et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) and burgasser et al .",
    "( 2007 ) a thorough discussion of the comparison and pitfalls between observed and modelled spectra for m dwarfs and subdwarfs .",
    "synthetic colours are computed from the model atmospheres using prescriptions very similar to those in casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , as we discuss in more details in appendix b. in figure [ vkplot ] we plot various colour indices as function of @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the models have problems in @xmath33 , being offset with respect to the observations by @xmath34  mag .",
    "such an offset is unlikely to be entirely due to uncertainties in standardize the @xmath12 band filter ( see appendix b ) and/or the zero - points ( as these amount to be at most @xmath35  mag ) and most likely reflects inadequacies in modeling the uv spectral region in cool stars .",
    "the models behave considerably better in the other optical and infrared bands , although @xmath36 and @xmath37 appear offset when going to dwarfs redder then @xmath38 which corresponds to @xmath39 ( compare with figure [ coltemp ] ) .    alternatively to @xmath32 , another excellent temperature indicator in cool stars is @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , figure [ ijplot ] looks very similar to figure [ vkplot ] , but the stars are now distributed over a shorter baseline .    in the left panel of figure [ ijhkplot ]",
    "we show infrared indices as function of @xmath41 , which is sensitive to decreasing spectral type for m dwarfs ( bessell 1991 ) .",
    "the models are in fair agreement with the data , but get worse going to the reddest @xmath41 . although at the very red end observed colours might be slightly less accurate ( section [ jc ] ) , bessell ( 1991 ) has shown that the large spread in observed colours for the latest m dwarfs is real .",
    "the reason is likely to be that at such cool temperatures m dwarfs show the effects of dust at bluer wavelengths and have slightly different spectra with stronger hydride bands and weaker tio and vo bands . in the purely infrared colour planes of figure [ ijhkplot ] we are working in narrow colour ranges and observational errors become prominent in the comparison . to help establish the trends we have also checked how these planes look when our sample of m dwarfs is complemented with the earlier one for g and k dwarfs from casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . at bluer",
    "colours the data show a turnover in @xmath36 and @xmath37 as function of decreasing temperature ( i.e. increasing @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "the models partly predicted this feature , which is the result of the sensitivity of infrared colours to the photospheric gas pressure ( mould 1976 ) as well as to the occurrence of @xmath44 bands . at very low effective temperatures ,",
    "the data suggest a flattening and a possibly a rising in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , whereas the models decrease steadily .",
    "the rising of the observed colours in the @xmath42 vs.  @xmath36 plane is confirmed by similar plot using dwarfs much cooler than we have here ( e.g. reid et al .",
    "2001 ; burgasser et al .",
    "this mismatch between data and models was already noticed in other models by brett ( 1995b ) , and essentially means that in the models @xmath18 and @xmath17 magnitudes become progressively fainter than @xmath16 magnitude as the effective temperature decreases .",
    "overall , the phoenix models show fair agreement with the data in various bandpasses , although inadequacies still persist , especially at the coolest temperatures where the dust needs to be properly incorporated .",
    "the synthetic colours also show a large spread with metallicity for decreasing @xmath4 : since our sample is limited to the solar neighbourhood , we expect our m dwarfs share a distribution similar to that observed in gk dwarfs , i.e. with most of the metallicities between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to this respect ,",
    "the coolest models are considerably offset with respect to the position of the stars which are encompassed by super - solar and solar lines , rather than solar and sub - solar as one would expect from the argument mentioned above .",
    "the serious discrepancies in @xmath12 band have little impact on the present work of calibrating the bolometric luminosities of the stars , since so little flux is emitted in the @xmath12 band . for the reddest stars , which correspond to effective temperatures below @xmath47 ( see figure [ coltemp ] )",
    "the models do show some problems , especially in the infrared .",
    "since our technique partly relies on model atmospheres , this means that at the very cool end the results we present in section [ abs_cor ] to [ tesca ] are still open to refinements .",
    "looking at figures [ vkplot ] to [ ijhkplot ] is obvious that by simply comparing observed and theoretical colours one would deduce different stellar parameters ( effective temperatures and metallicities ) depending on the colour index adopted for the comparison .",
    "the technique we present in the next section is less affected by such inconsistencies .",
    "in fact , we will use model atmosphere only to estimate the flux outside our multi  band photometry , i.e. the flux in the blue and red tails of the spectra .",
    "this estimate should be rather accurate as long as model atmosphere reproduce the overall spectral energy distribution , even though specific bands might have problems .",
    "notice though , where theoretical models do show limitations , like in the optical and near - infrared , we use anyway the observed colours .",
    "in addition , for estimating the metallicities we will calibrate our technique on other empirical measurements ( see section [ abs_cor ] ) , and this should keep under control the deficiencies that still affect theoretical models . nonetheless , it would be too optimistic to believe we are not affected by the inaccuracies in the models .",
    "future improvements on the theoretical side will certainly benefit to our technique , especially below @xmath0 .",
    "in our previous paper we used multi ",
    "band photometry to implement the irfm and we derived effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities and angular diameters for a set of g and k dwarfs ( casagrande et al .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether the same technique can be successfully applied to m dwarfs .",
    "although the underlying idea of the irfm is still valid when going to effective temperatures cooler than @xmath48 , some caveats exist . here , we generalize and extend our temperature scale to dwarf stars much cooler than in casagrande et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to which the reader can refer for an introduction to the formalism and details on the computation of the bolometric and monochromatic flux from multi  band photometry .",
    "the extension of the method presented here concerns the computation of @xmath4 , which is now done by using the fluxes in both optical and infrared bands ( section [ top_level ] ) . for this reason we call our method the multiple optical  infrared technique ( moite ) . as in casagrande",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) , the effective temperatures we derive depend on very few basic assumptions , namely the adopted vega absolute calibration and zero - points ( see also appendix b ) .",
    "the dependence on the adopted grid of model atmospheres is also not so crucial since most of the bolometric flux ( usually around 80 percent ) is recovered from our multi  band photometry .",
    "the moite proves to be also sensitive to metal content in m dwarfs , as we discuss in section [ met ] .",
    "the basic idea of the irfm ( blackwell & shallis 1977 ; blackwell , shallis & selby 1979 ; blackwell , petford & shallis 1980 ) is to compare the ratio between the bolometric flux @xmath49 and the infrared monochromatic flux @xmath50 , both measured at earth ( the so called observational @xmath51 factor ) to the ratio between the surface bolometric flux ( @xmath52 ) and the surface infrared monochromatic flux @xmath53 , predicted from model atmospheres . the ratio of the last two quantities defines the theoretical @xmath54 factor . from this ratio @xmath4",
    "can be computed iteratively as follow :      where the effective temperature determined at the @xmath56 iteration depends on the effective temperature determined at the @xmath57 iteration and which is used to improve the estimate of the quantities on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq_irfm ] ) . in the irfm , more than one infrared band",
    "is usually used ( i.e. @xmath54 is computed for each band ) , and the procedure described here is applied to each band separately . at each iteration",
    "the average @xmath58 obtained from all the infrared bands is then computed and the procedure is iterated until the effective temperature converges to a final value .    the irfm has been traditionally applied to stars of k or earlier spectral type , to derive effective temperatures approximately above @xmath3 .",
    "qualitatively , above this temperature , spectra roughly behave like black  body curves in the infrared , so that in this region the spectra can be described by the rayleigh ",
    "jeans law and the ratio between the bolometric and monochromatic flux depends on the effective temperature to some power , with little or no metallicity dependence ( figure [ fr ] ) .",
    "we now generalize the technique presented in the previous section to effective temperatures cooler than @xmath3 using both optical and infrared bands with the moite .",
    "we aim to give here a qualitative description of the underlying idea , leaving the full technical details to appendix a.        below approximately @xmath3 , molecular absorption and flux redistribution become very important and significantly change the original continuum shape , making any type of qualitative black  body description to an m dwarf spectrum hazardous also in the infrared .",
    "further , as the effective temperature decreases the peak of the spectra moves redward , until at @xmath59 it settles in @xmath16 band and stops moving further to the red ( allard & hauschildt 1995 ) . below @xmath48 , depending on the infrared band , @xmath54 flattens out and then monotonically increases with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "this behaviour in the infrared resemble that shown by @xmath54 also in the optical bands ( figure [ fr ] ) .",
    "it seems therefore obvious that below @xmath3 , depending on the metallicity , particular care must be used in determining the effective temperature by means of the flux ratio . on the other hand , since in cool stars",
    "@xmath54 behaves qualitatively the same in both infrared and optical colours , once a technique for determining @xmath4 is found , that can be readily applied to any photometric band .",
    "as we discuss in more detail in appendix a , when @xmath54 monotonically increases with decreasing temperature it is still possible to converge in @xmath4 if we compare the observed flux product @xmath60 to its theoretical counterpart @xmath61 .",
    "the apparent drawback of this method is that it introduces a dependence on the angular diameter , whereas such a dependence was canceled out when doing the flux ratio .",
    "however at each @xmath56 iteration the angular diameter can be estimated from the @xmath57 iteration          since this formalism is valid when @xmath54 monotonically increases with decreasing temperature , the advantage of this approach is that now it is possible to use also the optical colours to converge in effective temperature below @xmath48 .",
    "notice that to bootstrap either the irfm or the moite one needs to interpolate over a grid of synthetic spectra according to the details given in appendix a. to do so , the metallicity of a star must be known : when this is not possible , [ m / h ] has been obtained with the procedure we describe in the next section .",
    "figure [ fr ] shows that going to cooler @xmath4 , both optical and infrared colours start to show a strong dependence on the metallicity .",
    "we exploit this particularity to implement a novel technique to estimate the metallicities of the m dwarfs .",
    "the method works as follows : for a given star of unknown metallicity , we apply the moite to recover the effective temperature , assigning each time a trial [ m / h ] to the star , from @xmath64  dex to @xmath65  dex , in steps of 0.1  dex .",
    "the trial metallicity assigned to the star is used for interpolating over the grid of model atmospheres .",
    "the chosen metallicity range well brackets our ( rather local ) sample of m dwarfs . for a given star",
    "we obtain 6 @xmath66 which estimates @xmath4 from each of the colour bands individually @xmath67 , for each of the 26 different metallicity choices ( from @xmath64 to @xmath65  dex ) .",
    "since each band has a different sensitivity to the metallicity , the scatter among the 6 @xmath66 is at a minimum when the correct metallicity is chosen , as we prove in the next section for a set of synthetic colours .        for real data , there is an additional complication .",
    "empirically , for the 118 m dwarfs with known [ m / h ] , we find that the temperature estimates in each band @xmath66 are on average offset by a few 10s of k from the average @xmath4 with a dependence on both [ m / h ] and @xmath4 .",
    "this offset might be ascribed to zero - point errors in the absolute calibration ( see also fig . 8 and 12 in casagrande et al .",
    "2006 ) and/or to systematics in the spectral library , or both .",
    "the computation of @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the observed multi ",
    "band photometry depend on the adopted zero - points and absolute calibration ( casagrande et al .",
    "although our adopted vega absolute calibration has been thoroughly tested in both optical and infrared bands via ground ( tokunaga & vacca 2005 ) and spaced based ( bohlin & gilliland 2004 ; price et al .",
    "2004 ; bohlin 2007 ) measurements , uncertainties at the level of a few percent are present and are almost certainly responsible for the systematic offsets of order tens of kelvin in @xmath66 between different bands .",
    "stars with different metallicity and effective temperature emit differently in a given @xmath70 band ; since the adopted absolute calibration and zero - points change the contribution of each @xmath70 band into the final result , this explains why the offsets are function of [ m / h ] and @xmath4 .",
    "we use the 118 m dwarfs for which we know their metallicities to correct these offsets in @xmath66 obtained from each band . for the real stars ,",
    "this reduces the scatter in temperatures for each of the trial metallicities , and considerably assists in the recovery of the correct metallicity .",
    "notice that this correction to properly estimate [ m / h ] for our stars is calibrated on the bonfils et al .",
