    "<S> we reconsider the single production of the doubly charged higgs bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the lhc and tevatron in the framework of the left - right symmetric model and the higgs triplet model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the left - right symmetric model the production of @xmath0 by drell - yan process via @xmath2 exchange may give the dominant contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the same channel for the production of @xmath1 in the higgs triplet model is insignificant .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.6 cm    hip-2002 - 02th    due to the recent convincing experimental evidences , in particular those on atmospheric and solar neutrinos @xcite , the existence of neutrino masses below the scale @xmath3 has now become more and more established . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical explanations for the lightness of neutrinos has been suggested and discussed in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most attractive and natural one among them is the see - saw mechanism @xcite . in this mechanism one introduces , in addition to the ordinary dirac mass term , majorana mass terms for the left - handed and right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos form a special category among basic fermions in that they can have , due to their electric and color neutrality , such lepton number violating mass terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the majorana mass terms result from the yukawa couplings of lepton doublets with triplet higgs fields . </S>",
    "<S> the left - handed higgs triplet , @xmath4 , that gives rise to the majorana mass of the left - handed neutrinos , was first introduced by gelmini and roncadelli @xcite , while the right - handed higgs triplet @xmath5 naturally appears in the so - called left - right symmetric model @xcite , where it also takes care of the breaking of the left - right symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the origin of neutrino masses is quite difficult to figure out just by looking at the low - energy phenomenology of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomena like neutrino oscillations , leptonic decays of particles and the neutrinoless double beta decay are quite independent of the mechanism by which neutrino masses are created . </S>",
    "<S> indirect information could , however , be obtained by studying the physics related to the mass generation mechanism in high - energy collision process . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , indirect information on the see - saw mechanism can be obtained through the phenomenology of the triplet higgs fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of higgs triplets differs quite much from that of the model ( sm ) higgs doublets . </S>",
    "<S> the most dramatic difference certainly is the existence of a doubly charged scalar field ( @xmath6 ) within the triplets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , low - background signals are easy to find due to fact that the yukawa couplings of the triplet higgs bosons violate lepton number conservation , a symmetry strictly obeyed by the standard model interactions .    by studying the high - energy phenomenology of the triplet higgs fields one could get information on the properties of these fields and on the strengths of their yukawa couplings @xcite , @xcite , @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . several constraints on yukawa couplings can be obtained from experimental data @xcite , the most stringent limit @xcite coming from the recent results on muonium - antimuonium conversion @xcite : @xmath7    the tightening of these limits makes the study of the high - energy phenomenology of the triplet higgs bosons at future hadronic colliders interesting and well motivated .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the previous studies of the production of the doubly charged higgs bosons at hadronic colliders have concentrated to two production mechanisms : single production via @xmath8-fusion and the @xmath9 pair production via s - channel photon and z - boson exchange . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of these two production mechanisms at the lhc environment was presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more general analysis of various production mechanisms of the doubly charged higgs bosons at future colliders was done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis was , however , restricted to the case of the left - handed higgs triplet @xmath1 , where one can safely neglect the @xmath10 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> this vertex is proportional to the vev of the neutral member of the higgs triplet , which in the case of the left - handed triplet is very small due to the constraint set by the @xmath11 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the lhc could probe the left - handed doubly charged higgs boson up to a limit of 950 gev for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the lhc discovery potential in the case of the process @xmath13 was estimated in @xcite to be @xmath14 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that both of these numerical results were obtained with the assumption that @xmath1 decays to leptons only .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider some new aspects , not addressed in the previous studies , of the production of the doubly charged higgs bosons at hadron colliders lhc and tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will investigate the single @xmath6 production via the reaction @xmath15 ( see fig . 1 a and b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath8 fusion process is experimentally interesting due to its clear bilepton signature from the decay of the doubly charged higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the drell - yan - type production of a single @xmath6 via the process @xmath16 ( see fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 c and d ) . as we will see below </S>",
    "<S> , this process can be the dominant production mechanism for a wide range of parameter values in the case of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both of the processes go through the @xmath10 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the production threshold in the single production processes is lower than that in the pair production , and therefore these processes are particularly interesting phenomenologically as they probe a larger mass range of @xmath6 .    </S>",
