    "mixed spin ferrimagnetic ising models have been studied for some time , with a renewed interest , especially , in connection with compensation points , see , for instance , [ 1 - 11 ] .",
    "these points occur at temperatures , below the critical temperature , at which the sublattice magnetizations cancel exactly , giving zero total moment . as the temperature is tuned through such a point the total magnetization changes sign , which may be used in technological applications , most notably in magnetic recording .",
    "one of the simplest such models consists of classical ising spins s=1/2 and s=1 on a square or simple cubic lattice with the spins of different type being located on neighbouring sites of the lattice .",
    "its hamiltonian may be written in the form    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the antiferromagnetic coupling between spins @xmath2 on the sites of sublattice a , and neighbouring spins @xmath3 on sites forming the sublattice b. then , spins on each sublattice tend to order ferromagnetically , with opposite sign for the two types of spins .",
    "@xmath4 is the strength of a single  site anisotropy ( or crystal  field ) term acting only on the s=1 spins of sublattice b.    one may also choose @xmath5 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "the change has to be taken into account when calculating sublattice magnetizations and defining the compensation point .",
    "otherwise , the modified convention simply amounts to a rescaling of the exchange coupling @xcite .",
    "the mixed spin ising model , eq . ( 1 ) , is known , see , e.g. , @xcite , to lead to compensation points for simple cubic lattices , in accordance with mean  field theory @xcite , but not for square lattices , in contrast to mean  field theory . as has been observed already some years ago by buendia and novotny @xcite",
    ", compensation points may occur on square lattices , when adding a ( ferromagnetic ) coupling between next  nearest neighbouring ( nnn ) spins on the a sublattice . on the other hand",
    ", the authors did not find any evidence for compensation points , when considering nnn couplings for b spins , instead of the ones for a spins .    in the following article we shall challenge the latter suggestion , which seems to have been taken for granted by others , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "indeed , based on extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , we shall present clear evidence for compensation points due to nnn antiferromagnetic interactions between b , or s=1 , spins on the square lattice .",
    "in fact , the effect is not easy to identify .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in section 2 , to set the scene for the following parts , we define the model with nnn couplings between s=1 spins , discuss its ground states , and describe details of the simulations .",
    "the following section deals with the compensation points . in section 4 , mc results on critical properties and temperature dependent anomalies of the model will be presented .",
    "a brief summary is given in the final section .",
    "we shall study the following mixed spin ising model on a square lattice    @xmath7    with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbour couplings , @xmath8 between a spins , @xmath9 , and b spins , @xmath10 , a crystal  field term of strength @xmath4 acting on the b spins , and nnn couplings , @xmath11 , between b spins . note that we set a spins equal to @xmath12 , in accordance with previous work @xcite . to identify possible compensation points ,",
    "care is then needed in defining the magnetization of the sublattice a , see above and below .    to determine the ground states of the model in the ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) plane , we first select , like before @xcite , the structures which are stable among the ones described by 2@xmath152 cells of spins on the square lattice .",
    "one readily observes the possibility of degenerate ground states , eventually with indefinitely large unit cells .",
    "finally , we check the tentative ground state structures by monitoring spin configurations at very low temperatures obtained from careful cooling mc runs for lattices of various sizes .",

    "the phase diagram at vanishing temperature , @xmath16 , comprises four structures .",

    "the spins on each of the two sublattices order ferromagnetically , @xmath12 , with opposite sign on the sublattices a and b.    in two of the remaining other three ground states , s=1 spins may be in the state 0 , due to the single  site anisotropy term , @xmath4 . actually , for sufficiently large values of @xmath4 ,",
    "all spins of the sublattice b are in state 0 .",
    "we abbreviate the resulting structure as 0ii. the structure is highly degenerate , with each a spin being either @xmath17 or 1 , leading to a @xmath18fold degeneracy for @xmath19 sites on the sublattice a. in contrast , in the 0i structure , see figure 1 , only half of the s=1 spins are in the state 0 .",
    "they form , on the sublattice b , in the standard wood s notation for overlayers @xcite , a periodic c(@xmath20 ) superlattice .",
    "the other half of the spins on the b sites are ferromagnetically ordered , @xmath12 .",

    "each spin on the sublattice a may be either @xmath17 or 1 , leading , as for 0ii , to a large degeneracy .",

    "we also analyse the fourth  order cumulant of various ( sublattice ) order parameters , the binder cumulant @xcite , defined by    @xmath37    with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the second and fourth moment of ( staggered ) magnetizations of sublattice a or b. finally , we monitor typical equilibrium monte carlo configurations , illustrating the microscopic behaviour of the system and providing , e.g. , evidence for the ground states structures , as mentioned above .",
    "to test the accuracy of the simulations , we compared our mc data to those of previous accurate numerical work and to exact results by enumerating all possible configurations for small lattices with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "compensation points occur at temperatures @xmath41 , where both sublattice magnetizations cancel each other , with a vanishing total magnetization . in finite systems ,",
    "as one is studying in mc simulations , a convenient and efficient way @xcite to locate such points is to use the crossing condition @xmath42 . at low temperatures sufficiently far below the phase transition ,",

    "furthermore , at zero temperature , @xmath49 drops from 1 to 1/2 , when passing through the borderline between the af and 0i ground states .",
    "accordingly , one might speculate that compensation points , at low temperatures in the af phase , may show up close to the af0i borderline at @xmath52=0 .",
    "in fact , our preliminary mean  field calculations seem to suggest that lines of compensation points may spring from this af0i borderline .    however , in our mc simulations , investigating carefully several cases , we find no evidence for such compensation points in the af phase .",

    ", we analyse ground states with spins being in state @xmath17 or 0 on sublattice b , and in state 1 on sublattice a. then there are four possible flips of s=1 spins , namely flipping a spin from its state 0 to the state ( i ) @xmath17 or ( ii ) 1 , or flipping a spin from its state @xmath17 to state ( iii ) 0 or ( iv ) @xmath73 .",
    "obviously , only flip ( i ) will increase the sublattice magnetization @xmath43 above its value at zero temperature , @xmath74 , while otherwise @xmath51 will have a negative slope at low temperatures .",
    "now , one may readily calculate the energies of all four elementary flips .",
    "one obtains that flip ( i ) costs the lowest energy either followed by flip ( iii ) , when @xmath75 , or followed by flip ( ii ) , when @xmath56 . equation ( 7 )",

    "we further checked numerically the hypothesis , ( 7 ) , in determining lines of compensation points by fixing the nnn coupling @xmath14 not only at @xmath80 , but also at @xmath81 and @xmath82 , varying the strength of the single  site anisotropy term , @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , we observe compensation points in the 0i structure , which seem to arise , at zero temperature , from @xmath13= 3.2 at @xmath83 and from @xmath13= 2.4 at @xmath84 , in agreement with ( 7 ) .",
    "the latter case is displayed in figure 6 .",

    "thence , it becomes increasingly difficult to locate compensation points for lower values of @xmath14 .",
    "while mixed spin ising models are of much interest because of the potential presence of compensations points , they may exhibit other intriguing thermal properties as well .",
    "we shall focus on two aspects , the characterization of the phase transitions associated with the various ground states , and anomalies in the temperature dependence , especially , of the sublattice magnetization and the specifc heat @xmath26 .",

    "the resulting effective local critical exponent of the susceptibility is near 7/4 , even for moderate lattice sizes .",
    "thence , in all three cases , criticality seems to belong to the two  dimensional ising universality class .",

    "<S> we study ising ferrimagnets on square lattices with antiferromagnetic exchange couplings between spins of values s=1/2 and s=1 on neighbouring sites , couplings between s=1 spins at next  nearest neighbour sites of the lattice , and a single  site anisotropy term for the s=1 spins . using mainly ground state considerations and extensive monte carlo simulations , we investigate various aspects of the phase diagram , including compensation points , critical properties , and temperature dependent anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous belief , the next  nearest neighbour couplings , when being of antiferromagnetic type , may lead to compensation points . </S>"
