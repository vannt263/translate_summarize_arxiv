    "the nucleon resonance @xmath8 has the outstanding property of a very strong @xmath1 decay channel .",
    "the proper understanding of the low energy eta - nucleon interaction and threshold eta production consequently hinges on a correct description of the @xmath8 resonance .",
    "recently precise eta photoproduction data off protons and nuclei close to threshold have become available . at mami ( mainz )",
    "@xcite very precise angular distributions for the reaction @xmath11 have been measured from threshold at @xmath12 mev up to @xmath13 mev photon lab energy .",
    "together with an analogous experiment using virtual photons ( electroproduction ) performed at elsa ( bonn ) @xcite the data cover the whole range of the @xmath8 resonance .",
    "the measured cross sections clearly exhibit the strong @xmath8 dominance of near threshold @xmath14-production .",
    "furthermore , the cross sections for the @xmath14-photoproduction off nuclei @xcite show an @xmath15-dependence on the mass number @xmath16 , characteristic of strong , surface - dominated interactions .",
    "certainly , these new data demand a closer look at this particular nucleon resonance .",
    "the traditional picture of the @xmath8 is that of an excited three quark nucleon resonance , with one of three quarks orbiting in an @xmath17 state around the other two .",
    "this approach has however difficulties in explaining the large @xmath18 ) @xmath1 branching ratio . in @xcite the tensor force from the hyperfine interactions due to one - gluon exchange can produce the required su(6 ) mixing to cause a large coupling to the @xmath1 channel for the @xmath8 and a near - zero coupling for the @xmath19 .",
    "however , then there are problems in reproducing the observed total decay width .    at present a frequently used ansatz for incorporating the @xmath8 resonance into the @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath1 ( and @xmath20 ) system is to couple these channels directly to the @xmath8 via a phenomenological isobar model @xcite , @xcite with background terms @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are treated as free parameters .",
    "their values vary in the literature , but always @xmath22 is the larger of the two . the physical reason behind the large coupling of the @xmath8 to the @xmath1 channel is not understood .    in this letter , we investigate the possibility that the @xmath8 is a quasi - bound meson - baryon s - wave resonance . the basis of our calculation is the @xmath0 effective chiral lagrangian , with explicit symmetry breaking due to the non - vanishing up , down and strange quark masses properly incorporated .",
    "this approach successfully describes the @xmath23 resonance as a quasi - bound @xmath7 state @xcite . using the same lagrangian parameters",
    "as determined from our @xmath7 analysis , we extend the formalism to the energy range @xmath24 mev @xmath25 mev to explore whether any @xmath6 , @xmath26 resonances can be formed , and what their properties are . indeed , we find a resonant state with a large @xmath1 decay width as well as other characteristic properties of the @xmath8 .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian for meson - baryon interaction can be systematically expanded in powers of small external momenta @xcite @xmath27 where the superscript denotes the power of the meson momentum appearing in each term . in the heavy baryon mass formalism @xcite ,",
    "the leading piece at order @xmath28 reads @xmath29 with the chiral covariant derivative @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "as this part of the lagrangian incorporates all current - algebra results of the meson - baryon interaction , it is refered to as the weinberg - tomozawa or current algebra term . at next order in the expansion scheme , @xmath31",
    ", there is a host of new terms allowed by chiral symmetry @xcite . in the heavy baryon formalism the most general form relevant to s - wave scattering",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath32 the first term above is a relativistic correction involving the baryon mass @xmath33 in the chiral limit .",
    "the parameters @xmath34 gev@xmath35 and @xmath36 gev@xmath35 are determined from the mass splittings in the baryon octet .",
    "the other six parameters have been determined in a fit to the low energy @xmath7 experimental data @xcite , constrained by some @xmath37 and @xmath38 data .    in order to investigate the possibility of resonance formation",
    ", one needs a non - perturbative approach which resums a set of diagrams to all orders .",
    "since this leads necessarily beyond the systematic expansion scheme of chiral perturbation theory , we use a potential model .",
    "a pseudo - potential is constructed such that in the born approximation it has the same s - wave scattering length as the effective chiral lagrangian , at order @xmath31 .",
    "we note that this approach is quite similar to the one used in @xcite for the nucleon - nucleon interaction .    as in @xcite",
    "we examine two ways of parameterizing the finite range of the potential while keeping the born term the same : a local potential and one separable in the incoming and outgoing center - of - mass momenta .",
    "the local potential between channels i and j is chosen to have a yukawa form @xmath39 where the indices @xmath40 label the four channels @xmath2 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively . @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the baryon mass and reduced meson - baryon energy in channel @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the squared center - of - mass total energy and @xmath48 mev the pion decay constant @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 can be interpreted as average `` effective masses '' representing the spectrum of exchanged particles in the @xmath50-channel mediating the interaction .",
    "the relative interaction strengths @xmath51 which follow directly from the effective chiral lagrangian are listed in the appendix .",
    "the potential of eq.(4 ) is then inserted into the coupled channel schrdinger equation @xmath52 to solve for the multi - channel @xmath53-matrix .",
    "for comparison we also examine a separable potential in momentum space , @xmath54^{-1}$ ] , which is iterated in a corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation as described in @xcite .",
    "it is instructive first to discuss qualitative aspects of the calculation .",
    "the situation in the strangeness @xmath55 sector at energies near the @xmath4 threshold is similar to the @xmath56 case near the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "there the @xmath57 resonance can be produced as a quasi - bound @xmath7 state resulting from the strong @xmath58 attraction between the anti - kaon and the nucleon , as well as between the pion and sigma hyperon .",
    "this attractive interaction comes at leading order @xmath28 from the current algebra term , eq.(2 ) . for the quantum numbers @xmath55 , @xmath26 and @xmath6",
    "there are several important features :    * there is a strong attraction between the kaon and sigma ( see the large negative coefficient @xmath59 in the appendix ) .",
    "thus , as soon as the inverse range parameter @xmath60 exceeds a certain minimal value , a bound state will be necessarily formed below the @xmath4 threshold . *",
    "the direct interaction between the @xmath14 meson and the nucleon is very weak and there is a small direct coupling between the @xmath2 and @xmath41 channels ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 are small ) .",
    "* however , there is a strong coupling of both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels to the @xmath4 channel ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 are sizable ) . *",
    "thus _ the resonance formed will strongly connect the @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels through the coupled channel dynamics_.    let us for the moment consider only the current algebra piece , @xmath65 all @xmath66- and @xmath67-parameters are zero and the @xmath68 corrections are neglected . in this case @xmath69 , but @xmath70 and @xmath64 are large . in table 1 we show the resonance energy versus @xmath60 for both the local and separable potential using a common inverse range @xmath60 for all channels .",
    "the resonance position is identified when an eigenphase of the multi - channel @xmath53-matrix is equal to 90 degrees .",
    "thus , if @xmath71 mev for the local potential ( or @xmath72 mev for the separable one ) a resonance is necessarily formed below the @xmath4 threshold from the current algebra piece alone . experimentally , there are two @xmath73 nucleon resonances in this energy range , at @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev .",
    "since only the @xmath8 has a large @xmath1 branching ratio it is the main candidate for this dynamically generated resonance .",
    "next we include all order @xmath31 terms using values of the @xmath66- and @xmath67-parameters as previously obtained from a fit to the low energy @xmath7 data and allow for a @xmath76 uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "we note that they are similar for both potential forms @xcite .",
    "thus the only free parameters are the @xmath49 in eq.(4 ) .",
    "since the @xmath2 channel is far above its threshold a satisfactory fit to all the data using only one common range for all channels could not possibly be expected . however",
    ", a good fit was found using only two range parameters : one for the @xmath2 channel , and one common range for the other three .",
    "the off - diagonal ranges were taken to be @xmath77 .",
    "we performed a coupled channel calculation for the @xmath2 @xmath73 phase shift and inelasticity , as well as the @xmath78 cross section .",
    "the results of the fit for both the local and separable potential forms are shown in figs.1 and 2a , b . here",
    "the range parameters are @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev for the local potential . for the separable potential the range parameters are @xmath81 mev and @xmath82 mev .",
    "the values of @xmath83 and the @xmath67 parameters , which only differ by @xmath84 from @xcite , are listed in table 2 .",
    "it is remarkable that such a good fit to the @xmath2 @xmath73 phase shift and the @xmath14-production cross section is obtained with only two free parameters .",
    "clearly , one can not expect the @xmath73 inelasticity to be accurate since the @xmath85 channel is neglected here . nevertheless , this picture of the @xmath8 as a dynamic resonance based on the effective chiral lagrangian reproduces many of its properties .",
    "for example we obtain a resonance mass @xmath86 mev and a full width @xmath87 mev .",
    "these values agree favorably with existing empirical determinations @xcite,@xcite . as byproduct",
    "we extract the @xmath1 s - wave scattering length to be @xmath88 fm .",
    "this number is close to values found from other analyses @xcite .",
    "in fig.3 we display the @xmath43 and @xmath42 components of the bound state wave function at resonance .",
    "the root mean square radii are @xmath89 fm and @xmath90 fm for the @xmath43 and @xmath42 components .",
    "if there are only two reaction channels , it is often useful to parameterize the @xmath53-matrix in terms of its two eigenphases and a mixing angle @xmath91 . in the case of a pure breit - wigner resonance the @xmath92-matrix has the following energy dependence ( on @xmath93 ) : @xmath94 with det@xmath95 .",
    "the constant @xmath96 is the resonance mass and @xmath97 the ( energy dependent ) width . for a s - wave resonance which decays into two - particle final states unitarity requires the energy dependence of the width to be @xmath98 . here , @xmath99 is the center - of - mass momentum in channel @xmath46 and the constants @xmath100 are related to the partial decay widths @xmath101 . for a pure breit - wigner resonance ,",
    "one eigenphase of the @xmath53-matrix ( background ) is zero and the other one ( resonant ) has the energy dependence @xmath102 even though we do not have a pure breit - wigner resonance we find a resonant eigenphase ( see fig.4 ) which is very close to a breit - wigner form . in this figure , we plot both the resonant and non - resonant eigenphases versus pion lab kinetic energy for our calculation .",
    "the dots correspond to a breit - wigner form with parameters @xmath103 mev , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these numbers result in partial decay widths @xmath106 mev and @xmath107 mev .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath108 is still compatible with the existing analysis @xcite whereas @xmath109 is somewhat too large , presumably due to the neglect of the @xmath85 channel and our way of extracting @xmath100 . here",
    ", the @xmath100 are determined from the energy dependence of the resonant eigenphase .",
    "we note furthermore that at the @xmath110-threshold ( @xmath111 ) the @xmath2 @xmath73 phase shift reads according to eq.(7 ) @xmath112 within the two - channel calculation , since the background phase is zero at @xmath113 .",
    "therefore a good knowledge of this particular phase constrains the resonance mass and the @xmath2 partial decay width .    from the @xmath92-matrix for a pure breit - wigner resonance in eq.(6 ) , the ratio of cross sections for scattering from channel 1 @xmath114 2 divided by that for elastic scattering ( 1 @xmath114 1 ) is @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath116 defined as @xmath117 is exactly one for a pure breit - wigner resonance .",
    "any deviation from unity originates from the background eigenphase , assuming that the resonant eigenphase has well determined partial widths . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the quantity @xmath118 which involves @xmath73 partial wave cross sections only , versus the pion lab kinetic energy .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the potential model used here .",
    "since the @xmath14-production near threshold is strongly s - wave dominated , one can identify @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath73 component of the elastic @xmath2 cross section can be constructed from the partial wave analysis of @xcite . using these inputs together with @xmath121",
    "as determined from the shape of our resonant eigenphase , we display the result for this ratio .",
    "since presently the branching ratios @xmath122 have large uncertainties , we choose for reasons of comparison the values obtained here .",
    "the error bars in fig.5 reflect only those of @xmath14-production data .",
    "it is visible that @xmath116 deviates from unity as required for a pure breit - wigner resonance .",
    "this is an indication that background effects ( corresponding to a non - resonant eigenphase ) are not negligible . in @xcite",
    "a similar phenomenon was observed in sofar as the coupling constants of the resonance depended strongly on the treatment of the background ( nonresonant ) amplitude .",
    "also in @xcite the coupling constants of the @xmath8 had to be varied up to @xmath123 from the values obtained from the widths in order to obtain a good fit the the scattering data .",
    "this all points towards the presence of some background amplitude .",
    "we remark however that inclusion of the @xmath85 channel in our analysis would change the branching ratios and could considerably lower the ratio @xmath116 from the value shown in fig.5",
    ". if possible an experimental determination of this ratio would be very valuable .    in summary",
    ", we have used the effective chiral lagrangian at next - to - leading order to investigate the possibility that the @xmath8 resonance is a quasi - bound @xmath4-@xmath3 state . using the same parameters as obtained from fitting the low energy @xmath7 data and two free finite range parameters , a resonance can be formed at @xmath124 mev with the characteristic properties of the @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath2 @xmath73 phase shifts and inelasticities as well as the @xmath1-production cross section are remarkably well reproduced .",
    "the dynamically generated resonance has a full width of @xmath125 mev and branching ratios extracted from the shape of the resonance of @xmath126 into @xmath2 and @xmath127 into @xmath1 final states .",
    "furthermore , we elaborated on the background effects in the reactions dominated by the @xmath8 and proposed as a measure for it the ratio @xmath116 in eq.(10 ) .",
    "the coupled channel approach presented here can also be used in calculations of the @xmath14-photoproduction process , and we hope to report on this topic in the near future .      here",
    "we list the expressions of the relative coupling strengths @xmath51 in the @xmath26 basis entering the potential of eq.(4 ) in terms of the chiral lagrangian parameters .",
