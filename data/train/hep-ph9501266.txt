    "phase transitions in the early universe , as in condensed - matter systems , may lead to the formation of defects , such as cosmic strings @xcite . to determine the observational implications of defects one must follow their evolution from an initial state soon after the phase transition up to the time when they begin to have visible effects .",
    "there has recently been renewed interest in the problem of estimating the initial defect density , which provides the starting point for such studies .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the initial number density of strings formed at a first - order phase transition proceeding by bubble nucleation . for simplicity",
    ", we consider an abelian theory with a scalar higgs field @xmath0 , described by the lagrangian @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the potential @xmath4 is a function of @xmath5 with a local minimum at @xmath6 and a global minimum at @xmath7 .",
    "nothing happens at the theoretical critical temperature @xmath8 ( where the two minima of the high - temperature effective potential are degenerate ) .",
    "once the temperature has fallen well below @xmath8 , tunnelling can occur from the false vacuum state at @xmath9 to the true vacuum , where @xmath10 .",
    "this is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking : within each bubble there is a random choice of the phase angle @xmath11 .",
    "the bubbles nucleate at random points in space and then expand .",
    "the bubble walls accelerate , often nearly reaching the speed of light , until they meet and fill the whole of space .",
    "the nucleation rate per unit space - time volume is determined by the tunnelling probability , which may be calculated from the `` bounce '' solution of the euclidean field theory @xcite .",
    "it is likely to be a rapidly rising function of time , but for purposes of illustration let us assume that it is zero up to some given time and thereafter a constant @xmath12 .",
    "we also suppose that the bubble walls expand at speed @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter )",
    ". then the final mean number density of bubbles will be approximately @xmath16 , where @xmath17 .",
    "( these assumptions are in no way critical to our discussion . )",
    "the traditional picture of string formation is as follows @xcite . within each bubble",
    "the phase @xmath11 is essentially constant , but phases in different bubbles are uncorrelated .",
    "when two bubbles with phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 meet , the sharp discontinuity in the phase in smoothed out to become a smooth variation . for energetic reasons ,",
    "the system will tend to choose the shorter of the two paths between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the phase will increase from @xmath22 to @xmath19 ; but if @xmath23 , it will instead decrease from @xmath22 to @xmath24 .",
    "this is often called the `` geodesic rule '' .",
    "it has an obvious extension to higher symmetry groups .",
    "when three bubbles meet , a string or vortex may be trapped in the region between them . whether this happens or not is determined by the net phase change in going from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , to @xmath25 and back to @xmath18 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the three angles are independent random variables , uniformly distributed between @xmath22 and @xmath26 , and if the geodesic rule is correct , then the probability of trapping a string is @xmath27 .",
    "thus the initial string density ( length per unit volume ) is of order @xmath28 .",
    "this is obviously only a crude estimate .",
    "several of the assumptions we have made are questionable .",
    "some of the objections are relatively minor .",
    "it is clearly not precisely true that the phase within each bubble is constant .",
    "there must be random thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "so the geodesic rule will sometimes break down .",
    "when two bubbles meet , there may be local random fluctuations that will cause the phase to go the `` wrong '' way round in joining @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "but the effect of this would merely be a slight increase in the probability of trapping a string .",
    "indeed , there could also be a nonzero probability that the net phase change would be @xmath29 , thus trapping a string of winding number @xmath30 .",
    "as the bubbles grow , closed loops within which strings may be trapped will often be formed of more than three bubbles . however , as the bubbles expand further into the trapped region , it will generally be split up into several smaller regions . eventually , the remaining gaps will always be finally closed by the junction of three bubbles .",
    "there is a particular problem in cases where the velocity of the bubble walls is low . when @xmath31 we can be assured that no bubble collision can be causally affected by any previous collision ( because any two points on the expanding light cone are spacelike separated ) .",
    "but when @xmath32 , phase equilibration within a composite bubble might have been completed before the two components encounter a third bubble , thus reducing the chances of trapping a string .",
    "of course , some strings would still be trapped , because the three collisions would sometimes occur nearly simultaneously , but the string density would certainly be less .",
    "one very interesting open question ( to which we hope to return ) is whether in that event the relative proportion of small loops to long strings would be changed . at first sight",
    "one might think that if strings are rare then most of them would form small loops @xcite .",
    "if so , that would have a dramatic impact on the resulting cosmology .",
    "underlying all of these points is a more serious concern : does it make sense to talk of phase differences between bubbles in a gauge theory ?",
    "indeed by a gauge transformation , the phase difference can be set equal to any value we please .",
    "it has been argued by rudaz and srivastava @xcite that string formation in gauge theories might be strongly suppressed , although a recent analysis by hindmarsh _",
    "et al _ @xcite suggests that it is not .",
    "it is clearly important to understand the process of string formation in gauge theories .",
    "we begin by studying what happens when two bubbles meet .",
    "an important feature of the process of phase equilibration ( not included in previous analyses ) is the role of dissipation .",
    "we include an ohmic dissipation term in our equations .",
    "however , it will be useful first to consider the problem in the absence of dissipation , especially to clarify some issues relating to gauge choice and boundary conditions .",
    "there are two ways of dealing with the problem of gauge invariance .",
    "one is to use only gauge - invariant quantities , such as the covariant derivative @xmath33 .",
    "this approach provides valuable insights , but it is difficult to apply to the string - formation problem because we have to consider non - local variables such as the line integral of @xmath34 . the other is to choose a gauge , but that too has its problems .",
    "we need a _",
    "complete _ gauge choice , not merely a class of gauges like the lorentz gauge within which some gauge freedom still exists .",
    "there are several gauges we might choose :    i. the coulomb gauge .",
    "this works well provided we are considering only a limited region , outside of which there are no relevant charges .",
    "it is problematic in other cases , because boundary conditions are needed to solve the poisson equation for the scalar potential @xmath35 . in practice",
    ", this gauge is not as convenient as the others , so we shall not consider it further .",
    "\\ii . the unitary gauge , defined by setting the phase angle @xmath11 to zero .",
    "this is very convenient within any simply connected region where @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , it does not work if the region is non - simply connected or contains zeroes of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when strings are present . it will be useful in discussing the collision of two bubbles , but is less easy to use to study three - bubble collisions .",
    "the axial gauge defined by @xmath37 , together with a choice of gauge on the surface @xmath38 .",
    "this is particularly well suited to the problem of two colliding bubbles , where it matches the symmetry of the problem and provides a very neat solution , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "however , it is not very convenient for more general problems .",
    "\\iv . the temporal gauge , given by @xmath39 .",
    "this is universally applicable , and very simply related to the unitary gauge . to define it completely , we need a gauge choice at some initial time , but in our case this is straightforward",
    ": we assume that no electromagnetic fields are present before bubble nucleation starts , so that we can simply set @xmath40 at that time .",
    "the gauge is then defined for all times .",
    "however , this gauge does introduce somewhat artificial spatial discontinuities in various functions .",
    "it will be useful first to examin the collision of two bubbles with no damping of the phase oscillations .",
    "although this is a rather artificial problem , the results will help to motivate some of the more general discussion later .",
    "we begin by defining the gauge - invariant phase difference which plays an important role in determining the outcome of the collision .",
    "it is convenient to write the higgs field in polar form : @xmath41 then the equation of motion for @xmath11 is simply the continuity equation @xmath42 for the current @xmath43 the phase gradient @xmath34 is gauge - invariant and can be used to define a gauge - invariant phase difference between the two bubbles , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and points @xmath46 and @xmath47 are taken in bubble interiors . while the bubbles are well - separated , @xmath34 is appreciably different from zero only in the region where @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( assuming that @xmath51 prior to bubble nucleation )",
    ". then @xmath52 is independent of the choice of path between @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in general of course , @xmath53 is path - dependent , and to make it well - defined , we shall choose the integration path to be along the straight line passing through the bubble centers .",
    "to analyse what happens when the bubbles collide , we shall assume that the _ radial _ mode is strongly damped , so that @xmath54 settles rapidly to its equilibrium value @xmath55 .",
    "the equation for @xmath11 is then the klein - gordon equation @xmath56 with the gauge boson mass @xmath57 .",
    "let us first consider the central region of the collision , where the bubble walls can be well approximated as parallel approaching planes , so that the problem becomes one - dimensional .",
    "the initial configuration , just after the bubbles have collided , say at @xmath38 and @xmath58 , will then have @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 concentrated near @xmath38 within some distance @xmath62 .",
    "if the energy of the colliding walls is `` instantly '' dissipated , then @xmath62 is comparable to the lorentz - contracted wall thickness .",
    "( however , if the motion of the walls is relativistic , they are likely to overshoot and go through several oscillations before loosing their energy @xcite . in this case",
    "the collision region will be much wider and the phase equilibration process may be more complicated ) .",
    "it is not difficult to understand that in the course of the following evolution the `` wave packets '' of @xmath60 and @xmath61 will spread in the @xmath63-direction and oscillate at the frequency @xmath64 .",
    "the speed of spreading , @xmath65 , will be determined by the initial width of the packets : @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "( this qualitative picture is confirmed by explicit solutions of eq.([kleingordon ] ) with gaussian `` packets '' ) .",
    "an equation for the phase difference @xmath70 can be obtained by integrating eq.([kleingordon ] ) over @xmath63 , @xmath71 the boundary terms vanish as long as @xmath72 .",
    "the solution of ( [ harmosc ] ) is @xmath73 .",
    "we note the `` acausal '' behavior of @xmath53 : it varies on a microscopic timescale @xmath74 which can be much smaller than the radii of the colliding bubbles .    to extend the analysis beyond the central collision region",
    ", we shall now fix the gauge and solve the field equations for @xmath11 and @xmath75 .",
    "different gauges provide useful , and complementary , insights .",
    "we consider the simplest possible case , where the bubble walls are assumed to move essentially with the speed of light . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose a frame of reference in which the two bubbles nucleate simultaneously , say at the points @xmath76 .",
    "the bubbles first collide at @xmath77 , when the radii are @xmath78 .",
    "the problem has a high degree of symmetry : it is invariant under the 3-dimensional lorentz group so(1,2 ) in the @xmath79 subspace @xcite .",
    "the bubble collision occurs along the surface @xmath38 , @xmath80 ; for any point on that surface there is a frame of reference in which that is the point of first contact .",
    "the obvious gauge to use here is the axial gauge which picks out the one distinguished direction , the vector joining the nucleation centres .",
    "the symmetry of the problem shows that in this gauge we must have @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 the @xmath63 component of the maxwell field equation , with the current ( [ cur ] ) , yields ( with a suitable choice of arbitrary constant ) , @xmath84 thus there is just one independent unkown function .",
    "the remaining maxwell equations , together with the continuity equation for the current , show at once that both @xmath11 and @xmath85 obey the klein - gordon equation with mass @xmath86 , whence the functions @xmath11 and @xmath87 satisfy the equations @xmath88    for the initial conditions we assume that as we go from one bubble into the other , @xmath11 changes rapidly , say from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , while @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath92 we also require that @xmath93 up to and on the boundary of the bubble overlap region . using ( [ thetainit ] ) and",
    "( [ thetaa ] ) , this yields @xmath94    it is straightforward to solve these equations .",
    "the solution for @xmath95 ( the subscript indicates the gauge choice ) is @xmath96 where @xmath97 ( it is also possible to write this explicitly in terms of the bessel function of order zero , @xmath98 . )    the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath53 can now be deduced from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath99 at @xmath100 , @xmath101 this gives @xmath102 thus phase equilibration _ does _ occur in this gauge with a time scale determined , as one might expect , by the size @xmath78 of the colliding bubbles , with superimposed oscillations with frequency given by the gauge - field mass .",
    "similarly , @xmath103 is given by @xmath104.\\ ] ]    it is of course straightforward to transform to other gauges .",
    "the unitary - gauge fields are given by @xmath105 .",
    "these fields still exhibit the full symmetry of the problem ; one finds @xmath106 and @xmath107 the unitary - gauge fields again obey the klein - gordon equation together with the initial conditions @xmath108 @xmath109    finally , we can transform to the temporal gauge which , as we shall see , has some rather odd features .",
    "we find @xmath110 by integrating the equation @xmath111 we need an initial condition .",
    "assuming as before that outside the bubble overlap region @xmath112 , and using ( [ auni ] ) , we find @xmath113 it is interesting to note that in spite of our non - covariant choice of gauge , @xmath110 is still a function only of @xmath114 and @xmath63 .",
    "it satisfes exactly the same initial conditions ( [ thetainit ] ) as @xmath95 .",
    "however it does _ not _ satisfy the klein - gordon equation .",

    "the only non - zero component of the gauge potential is @xmath120 both @xmath121 and its derivatives vanish on the initial surface @xmath122 .",
    "it is non - zero only because it too does _ not _ satisfy the klein - gordon equation ; rather @xmath123    one effect of the extra terms in the field equations is that at late times , @xmath110 , unlike @xmath95 does not become uniform ; it tends to the static solution @xmath124 similarly , @xmath125 in a sense phase equilibration _",
    "never _ occurs in this gauge . of course ,",
    "@xmath126 does vanish .",
    "clearly we have to be careful if we use the temporal gauge to allow for these extra terms in the equations of motion .",
    "note that the time derivatives of @xmath110 and @xmath121 do obey the klein - gordon equation .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the form of the gauge fields .",
    "we easily find that the only non - vanishing components of @xmath127 are @xmath128 in other words , we have a longitudinal electric field , @xmath129 and azimuthal magnetic field @xmath130 ( in cylindrical polars ) .",
    "we now add an extra term to maxwell s equations : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the conduction current .",
    "this represents the effect of dissipation due to coupling with other fields .",
    "we shall assume that it can be written in the standard ohmic form , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the spatial part of @xmath132 is given by @xmath133 for some suitably defined conductivity @xmath134",
    ". the corresponding charge density @xmath135 is fixed by the requirement that the continuity equation , @xmath136 hold ( together with the intial condition @xmath137 at early times ) . in phase transitions with weak supercooling ,",
    "bubbles expand on a background of a dense relativistic plasma which is highly conductive . even in the case of strong supercooling",
    ", the energy released in the collision region creates a plasma of its own , and again the conductivity is expected to be high .",
    "we shall see that phase equilibration between colliding bubbles is strongly affected by plasma dissipation .    setting @xmath138 , we may write the equations ( [ maxeq ] ) as @xmath139 and @xmath140 the first of these only serves to define @xmath135 and is therefore not very useful .",
    "we should really also include a damping term in the equation for @xmath54 .",
    "however , we shall not consider that explicitly .",
    "instead , we assume that the oscillations in the radial direction in field space are efficiently damped so that when the bubbles collide @xmath54 rapidly settles down to its equilibrium value , @xmath141 .",
    "let us then specialize to the region inside the bubbles where @xmath141 . in this case , it seems best to consider first the unitary gauge .",
    "( for the moment we drop the subscript u. ) the equations then become @xmath142 and @xmath143 if the fields vanish outside a finite volume , we can unambiguously separate the longitudinal and transverse parts of @xmath144 , writing @xmath145 the transverse part satisfies the damped klein - gordon equation with mass @xmath86 : @xmath146 if we look for modes proportional to @xmath147 we find for @xmath148 the dispersion equation @xmath149 representing a damped oscillation .    for the longitudinal modes ,",
    "we find the third - order equation @xmath150 which yields @xmath151    if @xmath134 is small , there is one real root , @xmath152 where @xmath153 and a complex conjugate pair , @xmath154 for small @xmath155 , the latter two modes behave exactly like the transverse modes , but the first one is a much more slowly decaying mode with no oscillation .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath156 and @xmath157 , then all three roots are real : @xmath158 it should be noted that the slowly - decaying mode @xmath159 becomes pure gauge in the limit @xmath160 . in the next section",
    "we shall see that this mode does not affect the evolution of the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath53 .",
    "now let us briefly consider the equations in the temporal gauge . with @xmath161 ,",
    "the equations become @xmath162 and @xmath163 of course the equation for the transverse part of @xmath164 is exactly the same as before , eq .",
    "( [ eomtrs ] ) , but this time if we eliminate @xmath165 using ( [ eomtheta ] ) we find for @xmath110 a _",
    "fourth_-order equation : in fact @xmath166 satisfies the same equation ( [ eomphi ] ) as does @xmath167 .",
    "this is actually obvious because the gauge transformation between the two gauges shows that @xmath168 .    in the temporal gauge",
    "we always have the freedom of making an arbitrary time - indenpendent gauge transformation .",
    "thus the equations have static solutions in which @xmath11 is _ any _ arbitrary function ; of course @xmath169 must be chosen to make @xmath170 . note that since only @xmath171 appears in the equation , the extra terms discussed in the preceding section do not appear ; they would reappear , however , if we tried to write an equation for @xmath11 itself , incorporating the chosen initial conditions . in a non - simply connected region , the @xmath110 equation allows more general types of solution , in which it is not single - valued .",
    "for example , we could mimic a closed loop by imposing periodic boundary conditions , and look for solutions with @xmath172 .",
    "one such is @xmath173 , with @xmath174 .",
    "this is similar to the type of solution one would expect to see eventually around a string , once the oscillations have died down .",
    "as in section ii , we shall first consider the central region of a two - bubble collision , where the problem reduces to one - dimensional form .    in one dimension of course",
    "the only modes are longitudinal , so we should use ( [ eomphi ] ) or its equivalent in the temporal gauge .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath54 settles down rapidly to its equilibrium value .",
    "it is reasonable then to take as our initial condition , just after the bubbles have collided , say at @xmath38 at @xmath58 , a configuration where @xmath141 and ( in the temporal or axial gauge ) @xmath11 has a discontinuous jump from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , as in ( [ thetainit ] ) .",
    "we also assume that at that time there are no electromagnetic fields present , so we may take @xmath175    we can now transform back to the unitary gauge , where we find as before the initial conditions @xmath176 @xmath177 the solution is immediate : @xmath178 where @xmath159 and @xmath179 are given by ( [ eigo ] ) and ( [ eigs ] ) and the amplitudes @xmath180 satisfy @xmath181 the solution is @xmath182 with two similar equations obtained by permutation of @xmath183 .    the gauge - invariant phase difference ( [ gipd ] ) can be written as @xmath184 and can be evaluated using eq.([phisol ] ) . alternatively , we can obtain an equation for @xmath185 by integrating ( [ eqfora ] ) , @xmath186 the boundary conditions corresponding to ( [ bc ] ) are @xmath187 and the solution is @xmath188 where @xmath189 and @xmath190 note that the values of @xmath191 are the same as in eq.([eqforp ] ) for the transverse modes at @xmath192 .    in the small-@xmath134 case , we find @xmath193 it is interesting to compare this with the corresponding expression , ( [ thetaasy ] ) , in the undamped case .",
    "the oscillating factor is essentially the same in both cases .",
    "the difference is that here the dissipation causes exponential damping , while in the previous case the spherical geometry led to a linear damping . for large @xmath134",
    "there is no oscillation , and eqs.([deltaoft])-([apm ] ) give @xmath194 the characteristic time scale for the current damping , @xmath195 , is given by @xmath196    it is also interesting to look at the solution directly in the temporal gauge .",

    "these are given by ( [ ainit ] ) together with ( [ eomtheta ] ) : @xmath199 thus we find @xmath200 it is easy to verify , however , that in fact @xmath201 vanishes ; for small @xmath134 , we have @xmath202 it is interesting to note that in the limit @xmath203 , @xmath204 while @xmath205 .",
    "this shows that as before @xmath206 although @xmath207 approaches its limit more slowly at late times .",

    "let us now move away from the immediate neighbourhood of the point of first contact between the bubbles . in particular , we want to examine the magnetic fields present in the region where the collision occurs .    for simplicity , we again suppose that the two colliding bubbles have equal radii , @xmath78 , at the moment of collision .",
    "the main effect of the curvature is to delay the collision at points off the line of centres .",
    "if the collision occurs at the origin at time @xmath58 , then at a transverse distance @xmath228 , it will occur ( to first order in the curvature ) at time @xmath229 , where @xmath13 is the velocity of the bubble walls . as a first approximation",
    ", we may expect that the fields near @xmath230 have the same form as in the planar case , while more generally , for example , @xmath231 this of course has the effect of introducing transverse gradients into the fields .",
    "consequently , @xmath232 and @xmath233 are non - zero and in turn generate transverse components of @xmath169 .",
    "the physical result is the appearance ( as in the undamped case ) of an azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic flux actually forms a loop around the region where the collision is occurring .",
    "we are particularly interested in the total magnetic flux .",
    "it is possible to calculate that without going into the details , by looking at the line integral of the vector potential .",

    "we have assumed that there are no fields outside the bubbles . for simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that @xmath0 remains slightly non - zero , so that the phase @xmath11 is well defined and interpolates smoothly between its values inside the bubbles .",
    "( it would of course make no difference if we assumed some other distribution , so long as @xmath0 remains very small , but the argument is simpler in this case . ) it is easy to see that initially , when the bubbles have just met , @xmath238 in fact , using the definition ( [ deltheta ] ) , one sees that @xmath239 , while @xmath240 . on the other hand , after a time @xmath241 , with @xmath195 given by ( [ dampingtime ] ) , dissipation has reduced @xmath242 to zero , while leaving the other three legs unaltered .",
    "thus @xmath243 by hypothesis the loop contains no zeros of @xmath0 , so @xmath11 is single - valued .",
    "thus it follows at once that @xmath244    this is exactly what we should expect .",
    "note that when three bubbles meet the three magnetic flux tubes combine . if there is a total net phase change of @xmath26 around the loop , the total flux trapped is exactly one flux quantum , @xmath245 .",
    "it is interesting in passing to see how the result ( [ loopint ] ) emerges in different gauges . in the unitary gauge , of course",

    "there is no change in the values of @xmath11 at the four corners .",
    "initially , @xmath247 vanishes along @xmath246 , but after the dissipation its line integral exactly cancels @xmath248 .",
    "the most complicated situation occurs in the axial gauge . here",
    "we find that finally @xmath249 , which ensures that @xmath242 vanishes .",
    "however , to keep the line integrals along the transverse sections @xmath250 and @xmath251 zero , @xmath252 must acquire a non - zero value to compensate for the transverse gradient of @xmath11 ; it is easy to check that it does .",
    "at any particular time @xmath253 after the initial collision , the magnetic flux forms a ring . we can readily estimate its size .",
    "the outer edge occurs where the bubbles are just meeting , namely at a transverse distance @xmath254 the time taken for the currents generated to be dissipated at any given point is @xmath195 given by eq.([dampingtime ] ) . the inner edge of the ring occurs where dissipation is essentially over , namely at @xmath255 note that the ring becomes narrower as it expands .",
    "this is because it is slowing down .",
    "the speed of expansion is @xmath256 . if @xmath257 , this is always superluminal ( the small - angle approximation breaks down of course when @xmath253 becomes of order @xmath78 ) . in that regime",
    ", one should not think of a tube of magnetic flux moving outwards , but rather of magnetic flux being created and destroyed at successively larger radii . on the other hand , if @xmath32 , the speed may eventually be less than @xmath258 . at that point , we can no longer disregard the region outside the bubbles .",
    "while the magnetic field is expelled from bubble interiors ( as in the meissner effect ) , it has a tendency to spread at the speed of light in the false vacuum region outside the bubbles . if the conductivity due to particles present in that region can be neglected , then the outer radius of the magnetic flux ring is @xmath259 , while the inner radius is given by eq.([radius ] ) . at @xmath260",
    "most of the flux will escape to distances greater than the bubble radii .",
    "if a third bubble arrives after that , the probability of vortex formation in this three - bubble collision will be strongly suppressed .",
    "realistically , however , the case of low bubble velocities corresponds to weak supercooling , when bubbles expand on a background of relatively dense plasma , and the conductivity in the exterior region is far from being negligible .",
    "the magnetic field dynamics in a conducting medium is described by the equation @xmath261 it is easily seen that the characteristic time of magnetic field variation on a length scale @xmath262 is @xmath263 , and thus the speed of magnetic flux spreading is @xmath264 in the limit of very high conductivity , @xmath265 ( the magnetic flux is `` frozen '' into the plasma ) .",
    "if the typical bubble radius at collision is @xmath266 and the velocity is @xmath13 , then the condition for the flux spreading to be negligible is @xmath267    in order to assess the validity of this condition , we shall need estimates for @xmath266 , @xmath134 and @xmath13 .",
    "the radius @xmath266 can be estimated as @xmath268 , where @xmath12 is the bubble nucleation rate . to estimate the conductivity @xmath134 ,",
    "we represent the drift velocity of charged particles as @xmath269 where @xmath148 is the average momentum gained by a particle between collisions , @xmath270 is the electric field , @xmath114 is the mean free time , @xmath271 is the temperature , and @xmath272 is the average particle energy .",
    "the mean free time is @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the characteristic scattering cross - section and @xmath275 is the density of charged particles .",
    "now , the current density is @xmath276 , and thus @xmath277 and the condition ( [ condition ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath278 since the average bubble separation @xmath266 is expected to be greater than the thermal particle wavelength @xmath279 , the right - hand side of ( [ newcondition ] ) does not exceed @xmath280 .",
    "the temperature at the phase transition is typically @xmath281 , and eq.([conductivity ] ) corresponds to the high - conductivity regime , @xmath282 .",
    "the bubble velocity @xmath13 in the overdamped regime can be roughly estimated from @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is the force of friction due to particle scattering off the bubble wall , and @xmath285 is the vacuum energy difference between the two sides of the wall .",
    "both @xmath284 and @xmath286 are model - dependent , but in all cases @xmath287 , which gives a lower bound on @xmath13 , @xmath288 typically , one finds that bubble velocities are rather high . for example , a detailed analysis for the case of electroweak phase transition gives @xmath289 .",
    "this suggests that the condition ( [ newcondition ] ) is typically satisfied , so that the magnetic flux does not escape .",
    "exceptions may occur in cases of nearly degenerate vacua , when @xmath286 is very small .",
    "our main conclusions can be formulated in terms of the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath290 defined in eq.([gipd ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath53 remains equal to its initial value while the bubbles are well - separated and undergoes damped oscillations after the collision .",
    "the oscillation period is determined by the gauge boson mass , and the damping time by the plasma conductivity .",
    "both timescales are typically much smaller than the bubble radii at the time of collision .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the case of a global symmetry breaking , when the phases in the bubble interiors can change only after the arrival of the goldstone boson waves propagating at the speed of light from the collision region .",
    "the currents associated with the oscillating phase gradients generate a magnetic field which is concentrated in a ring - shaped region near the circle on which the bubble walls intersect .",
    "the total magnetic flux is determined by the initial value of @xmath53 , @xmath291 right after the collision , the radius of the intersection circle grows faster than the speed of light , but if the bubble expansion is substantially slowed down by interaction with ambient plasma , the speed may eventually become nonrelativistic .",
    "the magnetic field then begins to spread into the exterior region and can in principle escape to distances large compared to the bubble radii . however , magnetic field has a tendency to be `` frozen '' into a conducting plasma , and the speed of spreading is typically smaller than the bubble expansion speed ( with the exception of cases of nearly degenerate vacua , when the bubble velocities are extremely small ) .    in a three - bubble collision ,",
    "the three magnetic flux tubes combine when the bubbles meet .",
    "the resulting magnetic flux is @xmath292 , where @xmath293 is the sum of the initial phase differences between the bubbles and @xmath275 is an integer . for @xmath294 , a vortex",
    "is formed carrying @xmath275 flux quanta , @xmath295 .",
    "thus , although the physics of bubble collisions turned out to be interesting and complicated , our conclusions are essentially the same as those resulting from the naive analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to mention some open questions . as a matter of principle , it would be interesting to understand what happens when the bubble expansion speed is so low that most of the magnetic flux does escape .",
    "one expects that the vortex density in this case is suppressed , and we are currently investigating what effect this may have on the properties of the resulting string distriution .    throughout the paper we assumed that the radial mode of the higgs field is strongly damped and settles to its equilibrium value on a timescale short compared to the phase equilibration process . in general , however , the energy dissipation in the radial mode is itself a complicated process and can take considerable time , especially in the case when the colliding walls are relativistic .",
    "the phase equilibration in this case can be studied using numerical simulations .",
    "another interesting and important question is what effect thermal fluctuations of the magnetic field and of winding number have on the vortex formation . a naive estimate of the magnetic flux fluctuation on scale @xmath266 is @xmath296 , where @xmath271 is the temperature .",
    "this could in principle be much greater than a single flux quantum .",
    "if all this flux is squeezed into a vortex by advancing bubble walls , then we can expect that a sizable proportion of vortices will have large winding numbers",
    ". a particularly interesting situation may arise in models where the gauge bosons are heavier than the higgs particles , so that @xmath297 strings are stable . in this case one",
    "expects the formation of an interconnected network of strings with different winding numbers .",
    "the cosmological evolution of such a network may be very different from the standard picture .",
    "thermal fluctuations may also play an important role in defect formation during first - order phase transitions with a global symmetry breaking . in this case , the phase @xmath11 is a massless goldstone field , and its fluctuation on scale @xmath266 is @xmath298 .",
    "once again , this can be large , resulting in the formation of large vortex clusters .",
    "we note , however , that multiply charged vortices are unstable in the case of a global symmetry breaking , and we expect the clusters to disperse .",
